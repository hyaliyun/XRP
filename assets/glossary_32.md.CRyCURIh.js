It was followed by four sequels. Background All-of-a-Kind Family is based on Sydney Taylor's recollections of her childhood on Manhattan's Lower East Side, where her family settled along with many other Jewish families after migrating from Eastern Europe by way of Germany. The main characters are named for Taylor's real-life sisters, Ella, Henny, Charlotte, and Gertrude, and the middle sister was given the author's birth name, Sarah. The book's genesis was stories of her childhood that Taylor would tell her daughter, Jo. Taylor wrote: > \\"I took my daughter Jo down to the old neighborhood where Papa, Mama and the > five little girls had lived. But the past was dead there; it lived only in > me. I decided to write it all down for Jo. Perhaps in this way I could re- > create for both of us some feeling of that other life.\\" While Taylor wrote All-of-a-Kind Family for her daughter, by some accounts she had no plans to publish the story. But, the story goes, her husband secretly submitted the manuscript for the Charles W. Follett Award in 1951, and it won, launching Taylor's career and what would become a five-book series. The book is noteworthy for its depiction of a joint Jewish American identity, with the characters expressing both pride in their Jewish traditions and American patriotism, following the trajectory of Taylor's own family's assimilation. \\"Not only are Jewish customs explained honestly and frankly, but Taylor makes them attractive and positive, drawing in her readers, both Jewish and non- Jewish,\\" the scholar June Cummins writes. Plot Ella, Henny, Sarah, Charlotte, and Gertrude are five sisters growing up on the Lower East Side of Manhattan in 1912. The book follows them through a year of their childhood, as they deal with mundane chores, find joy in eating candy in bed and collecting used books from their father's junk shop, recover from scarlet fever, and celebrate Jewish holidays such as Purim and Sukkot as well as the Fourth of July. They also inadvertently help their father's friend Charlie solve a mystery from his past and, in the end, welcome a new family member. Main characters *Ella: The oldest of the five sisters, at age 12. *Henny: The second sister, age 10. *Sarah: The middle sister, and the author's avatar. Age 8. *Charlotte: The younger sister with her head in the clouds, age 6. *Gertie: The youngest of the five sisters, age 4. *Mama: The girls' mother, a resourceful homemaker. *Papa: The girls' father, who runs a junk shop. *Kathy Allen: A librarian at the local library who befriends the girls. *Charlie: Papa's friend, a junk peddler with a mysterious past. Sequels Taylor followed All-of-a-Kind Family with four sequels: More All-of-a-Kind Family, All-of-a-Kind Family Uptown, All-of-a-Kind Family Downtown, and Ella of All- of-a-Kind Family. The final book was published shortly after Taylor's death in 1978. Awards and legacy Taylor received the Charles W. Follett Award for All-of-a-Kind Family's contribution to children's literature in 1951. All-of- a-Kind Family was also the first recipient of the Jewish Book Council's National Jewish Book Award for children's literature in 1952. The book is considered foundational to the development of American Jewish children's literature, and the Association of Jewish Libraries' annual children's literature award is named the Sydney Taylor Book Award in honor of Taylor's work. The publisher Lizzie Skurnick, who reissued the All-of-a-Kind sequels, describes Taylor's depiction of American Jewish life as \\"completely singular. They’re the first series about a Jewish family ever, one that’s not only about the family, but about Jewish culture, New York, the turn of the century, vaudeville, polio, the rise of technology.\\" ReferencesExternal links *All-of-a-Kind Family at the Jewish Book Council Novels set in New York City 1951 books Jewish literature Children's books American children's books ","title":"All-of-a-Kind Family"},{"id":"21242108","text":"The Vossloh G 2000 BB is a four axle heavy shunting and mainline locomotive built at the former MaK plant in Kiel. At the time of its introduction in 2000 it was the most powerful hydraulic transmission locomotive in Vossloh's range. The Deutsche Bahn AG (DB AG) reporting number for this loco is 253. History and Design The asymmetric cab allows an external viewpoint at the front of the loco The locomotive was unveiled at Innotrans in 2000. The initial model had an asymmetric cab (see image) with a walkway; the asymmetric cab design allows the walkway to extend all the way to each end of the locomotive; coupled with remote control operation this means that shunting can be done from an external viewpoint whilst still riding on the locomotive. The design is modular with various components (engine, drive etc.) coming from different suppliers. External styling was by Tricon-Design. A second variant was produced, this time with a symmetrical cab; two different versions of this model were produced - one for the Italian market (G 2000-2 BB) with left hand drive (trains in Italy generally keep to the left) and another (G 2000-3 BB) with right hand drive for Germany. The new cabs had seating for two operators, in other respects apart from the cab these two models are identical to the initial asymmetric offering. Starting in 2004 two further sub designs were made: G 2000-4 BB with a MTU engine which increase the power to 2700 kW. This variant also included a hydrodynamic retarder (a type of braking system) as part of the Voith supplied transmission package. The last variant is G 2000-5 BB which has the same upgrades as the fourth offering, it is designed for the Scandinavian market and as such has anti wheel slip technology, and can be equipped for service down to . Operators and Use The locomotives are certified for use on the railways of Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Netherlands, Belgium, France, Sweden, Denmark and Poland. The locomotives are operated by many companies, many of them on lease. Angel Trains and MRCE both act as leasing companies, with Angel Trains providing the vast majority of the leased locomotives. Other owners include Azienda Consorziale Trasporti (ACT) and SBB Cargo (as class SBB Am 840) The machines find use in northern Italy and in the German Ruhr region as well as being used for cross border traffic in the Benelux region. Railion, Euro Cargo Rail, Rail4chem and others all use this locomotive. The locomotives are used for freight. In Italy, these are notably owned by TPER, which uses them in some.of its cargo services under the operations of Dinazzano Po The Swedish rail company Hector Rail operates a G 2000-4 and a 2000-5 machine.

Biography Previously, he worked as a telephone engineer and played with a band called The Bubbles. In 1972, he joined Salvation, formed by brothers Kevin and Jim McGinlay, along with drummer Kenny Hyslop and guitarist Midge Ure. After Kevin McGinlay left in 1974, the band became Slik and began to release singles, among them, two hits: \\"Forever and Ever\\" and \\"Requiem\\", both released in eponymous singles, in 1975 and 1976, respectively. Slik fame was growing during 1976, but late that year, punk rock bands were hitting the musical scene, so in 1977, the band changed their name, to PVC2, after McGinlay was replaced by Russell Webb, and began to play as the latter bands did. In September 1977, Midge Ure left PVC2, and the rest called Willie Gardner to replace him, and the band renamed themselves as Zones. Zones lasted until 1979, and the band finally split up. McIsaac and Hyslop continued with a project called Science, a band considered as a continuation of Zones, but only McIsaac was the supposedly remaining member. Hyslop and bassist Russell Webb joined The Skids, Ure joined Thin Lizzy, Ultravox and Visage and the McGinlay brothers were working alone again. He had also a solo career, releasing \\"Love Me Like You Did Before\\" as a single. In 1990, he studied piano performance at the Royal Academy of Music, in Glasgow. In 1995, along with singer Maureen McMullan and saxophonist/keyboardist Gordon Bowie, he formed the Billy McIsaac Band, who claim to be the number-1 wedding band in Scotland.

Flowers grow in inflorescences coloured red to maroon. The fruit are between blue and green. They are considered inedible because of the seeds they contain.

Football career Turner was born in South Moor, Stanley, County Durham and played his early football with various clubs in North East England, including Dipton United, Scotswood and Leadgate Park. His professional career was delayed by the First World War but in September 1919 he moved to the South Coast to join Southern League, Southampton for a fee of £200. =Southampton= He made his \\"Saints\\" debut on 8 November 1919 in a 4–0 victory (three goals from Bill Rawlings) over Southend United when he took over at left back from Fred Titmuss. Following injuries to half backs, George Bradburn and Reg Hackett in March 1920, Turner was moved forward to left-half, a position he retained for the rest of his professional career. In 1920, the Saints were elected to the Football League Third Division for its inaugural season, in which Turner was ever-present. Although they finished second in the league, Southampton missed out on the only promotion spot to Crystal Palace. Under manager Jimmy McIntyre, Saints went one better in 1921–22, finishing equal on points with Plymouth Argyle but with a superior goal average, with Turner once again ever-present. He was the only member of the promotion side who cost Southampton a fee, with Saints conceding only 21 goals. This total of goals conceded in a 42 match season was a Football League record which stood until 1979 and remains a record for Southampton. The half back line of Bert Shelley, Alec Campbell and Turner cemented Saints place in the Second Division over the next few years, until Turner lost his place to Arthur Bradford in April 1924. In 1924, he moved to the First Division Bury – in his five seasons at The Dell, Turner made 166 league and 20 FA Cup appearances, scoring once. =Bury and Q.P.R.= In a bid to strengthen the team following their return to the First Division, Bury signed Turner in April 1924, with Stan Woodhouse and John Callagher moving to the south coast as part of the deal. Turner was ever-present for the 1924–25 season as Bury finished fifth in the table, followed up by a fourth-place finish in 1926. In the 1926–27 season injury restricted Turner to five appearances, as manager James Hunter tried several players at left half, with the team finishing just above the relegation zone. After three years of dependable service, Turner returned to the Third Division South in 1927, spending one season with Queens Park Rangers before retiring.

The home for several centuries of the Mackworth family, it was at some point reduced to the ruins of a gatehouse suggestive of a grand castle. A survey from 1911 suggested that though the gatehouse resembled a castle, the rest of the structure may have been more modest. The remains are part of a designated Scheduled Ancient Monument. History The date of construction of the castle is uncertain; ranges have been given from the early 14th to the late 15th centuries. (public domain) The first Mackworth, Henry du Mackworth, appears in the Pipe Rolls of 1254, and the MackWorth lineage can be followed from the early part of the 15th century. Mackworth castle remained in the family until 1655 or 1656, when it was sold by Sir Thomas Mackworth, 3rd Baronet, who had relocated to Normanton in Rutland,'Parishes: Mackworth - Mugginton', Magna Britannia: volume 5: Derbyshire (1817), pp. 202-217. URL: http://www.british- history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=50732 Date accessed: 16 April 2013. to Sir John Curzon, 1st Baronet.Kerry, 6. Kerry indicates the deed was dated 16 June 1655. Local legend says that the castle was destroyed during the Parliamentary Civil War by some ordnance on a nearby hill. However, Rev. Charles Kerry of the Derbyshire Archaeological Society questions whether the castle had already begun to decline before its purchase by Curzon, noting that, \\"Had Mackworth Castle been a place suitable for the reception of the Queen of Scots, Sir Ralph Sadler would not have overlooked it when en route with his charge for Tutbury.\\" Sadler chose to lodge Mary, Queen of Scots, a decision which irritated Queen Elizabeth. He wrote in explanation on 5 February 1584, that he would not have done so had there been any appropriate houses anywhere near that town in which to house his charge. Primarily, what remains of the building is its gatehouse, a square, heavily battlemented structure which could stand as a separate building in itself. According to English Castles: A Guide by Counties, the gatehouse was a Tudor-era addition; Kerry dates it to a little before 1500.Kerry, 8. Some understanding of the layout of the rest of the building can be derived from the rectangular spaces on the west of the gatehouse, which once formed courtyards. The ruined gatehouse is a Grade I listed building. According to Anthony Emery in Greater Medieval Houses of England and Wales, 1300-1500: East Anglia, Central England and Wales, the structure may never have been very grand. He recounts that a 1911 survey suggested that the walls surrounding those spaces were likely \\"timber-framed on low rubble walls\\", similar to the nearby 14th-century house of the Tuchet family, for whom the Mackworths served as stewards. Emery writes that \\"[t]he gateway was no more than a display structure, a very early example of that hankering for a world of chivalry and romance that had already passed.\\" =Hollywood reference= Mackworth Castle is the scene of events that take place in the 1954 movie The Black Shield of Falworth, starring Tony Curtis, which itself is based on the 19th century historical novel Men of Iron by the American author Howard Pyle.

The Duchess had been intended to follow on from the propeller-driven Princess and drew heavily upon its design. Being larger than preceding commercial flying boats, as well as the novel use of jet engines for such a vehicle, Saunders-Roe promoted the Duchess as representing the next generation of flying boats to various civilian airlines. During the early 1950s, it was also promoted for military applications such as aerial reconnaissance and military transport duties, as had been the Princess. An even larger flying boat, the Saunders-Roe Queen, was also proposed around the same time. Unlike the Princess, however, no examples of the Duchess ever flew; attempts to garner interest in the concept never resulted in any orders being placed for the type, thus it never left the drawing board. Development Prior to the Second World War, British airline Imperial Airways had successfully used large long-range passenger flying boats, aircraft that could land and take off from the water, such as the Short Empire and Short S.26 to build up a network of long distance routes.Kaplan 2005, p. 196. These flying boats had not only pioneered new aerial routes across the British Empire which had previously not been served at all, passengers were transported within an unprecedented level of comfort, being provided with luxurious first class accommodation, including a promenade, sizable galley, separate bathrooms for men and women, and individual cabins for passengers. However, operations of these flying boats had been disrupted by wartime, during which Imperial Airways had also merged with British Airways Ltd to form British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) in 1940.Kaplan 2005, pp. 196–197. Even prior to the war's end, the British Air Ministry was enthusiastic on the prospects for reviving the shuttered flying boat routes.Kaplan 2005, p. 200. During this same era, the British aircraft manufacturer Saunders-Roe had established itself as a prominent specialist in the field of flying boats in both civil and military contexts. The company foresaw a need of increasingly larger flying boats in the postwar era. Accordingly, the firm opted to design such an aircraft, which it named the Princess, a large turboprop-powered flying boat. While several prototypes were constructed during the early 1950s, no buyers would emerge for the Princess as airlines opted to pursue the increasingly capable ground-based airliners instead, such as the newly-developed de Havilland Comet, the world's first jet-propelled passenger aircraft. Despite the Princess's failure to attact orders, Saunders-Roe proposed several other flying boat designs, including the Duchess, which, unlike the Princess, harnessed the recent innovation of jet propulsion. The design of the Duchess drew heavily upon that of the prototyped Princess. Despite this, this new design was considerably smaller than the Princess, and was to have been powered by a lower number of engines as well. Additional supporting data for the Duchess's development was provided by the Marine Aircraft Experimental Establishment (MAEE), based at Felixstowe. Saunders-Roe vigorously promoted the Duchess both to prospective customers, both domestic and international. They displayed a model of the aircraft at the 1950 Farnborough Air Show. Though primarily marketed for civilian purposes, Saunders-Roe had also envisioned military application for the Duchess. During the early 1950s, the company submitted a proposal under which the Duchess would have been adopted for aerial reconnaissance and military transportation purposes. Tasman Empire Airways was reportedly considering placing an order for the Duchess to use on its routes between Australia and New Zealand; however, development of the aircraft was ultimately abandoned after Saunders-Roe failed to secure any orders. Design The Saunders-Roe Duchess would have been a high-wing cantilever monoplane, featuring a relatively conventional tail and a full- length planing bottom hull. It was provided with a swept wing. For stability, the wing would have carried floats near each wingtip; these would have incorporated a retraction mechanism to reduce drag. It would have been powered by an arrangement of six de Havilland Ghost turbojet engines mounted inside of the wingroots. The Duchess was projected to be capable of attaining speeds of up to 500 mph, unheard of amongst preceding flying boats.Kaplan 2005, p. 205. The Duchess was to be furnished with a pressurised and air-conditioned cabin; in the manufacturer's envisioned default configuration, this cabin would have accommodated a maximum of 74 passengers across two separated compartments, between which a central freight hold was positioned to mimise payload impact on the flying boat's centre of gravity. The fuselage was lined with large round windows to provide passengers with exterior views.

He was the eldest son of George II the Pious, Duke of Brzeg-Oława-Wołów, by his wife Barbara, daughter of Joachim II Hector, Elector of Brandenburg. He was named after both grandfathers: Joachim II Hector and Frederick II of Legnica. Life=Youth= During his father's reign, Joachim Frederick wasn't included in the government of the Duchy of Brzeg. He spent seven years at the court of his maternal uncle, John George, since 1571 Elector of Brandenburg. As a representative of Brandenburg, Joachim Frederick appeared at the coronation of Henry of France as King of Poland in 1574, and in the coronation of King Rudolf II in Rome on 27 October 1575. Two years later, he received a dowry of 15,000 talers secured for the town of Wąsosz on occasion of his marriage with Anna Maria of Anhalt. =Duke of Oława-Wołów= George II died on 7 May 1586. Joachim Frederick, together with his younger brother John George took the government of Oława (where they settled his residence) and Wołów but not in Brzeg, who was given by the late Duke to his widow Barbara of Brandenburg as dower. When John George died on 6 July 1592 without surviving issue, Joachim Frederick became in the sole ruler of all their domains, except the two main cities of Brzeg (dower of his mother Barbara) and Oława (dower of his sister-in-law Anna of Württemberg, widow of John George). However, two events changed this situation: on 24 October 1594 Anna remarried with Duke Frederick IV of Legnica (and in consequence lost her dower lands), followed two months later by the death of Barbara, on 2 January 1595. Joachim Frederick reunited all the paternal heritage under his rule. His Duchy also expanded thanks of the districts of Dzierżoniów and Srebrna Góra, who had rich deposits of precious metals. Also, in 1596 he inherited Legnica after the death of Duke Frederick IV without surviving issue. =Government and functions= Joachim Frederick was an efficient ruler. He ratified the former privileges of his cities and supported the development of crafts. In Oława he built fortifications and opened mints, thanks to the mines of Dzierżoniów and Srebrna Góra. Also, he established a pension for the unmarried daughter of the deposed Henry XI of Legnica. Thanks to his family connections and his good relations with the Prague court, he held honorable functions. Since 1585 he held the dignity of Lutheran Provost of the Chapter of Magdeburg, and in 1588 was appointed the General Commander of the Regular Army of Silesia. =Death= Joachim Frederick died on 25 March 1602 in Brzeg. On 7 May, he was buried in the local church of St. Hedwig. Under his will, wrote on 16 December 1595, he gave the district of Oława to his wife as dower. He was succeeded by his two surviving sons, John Christian and George Rudolf. Since both are minors at that time, the regency was exercised, firstly by their mother Anna Maria, and after her death in 1605, by their uncle Charles II of Poděbrady, Duke of Ziębice-Oleśnica. Marriage and issue In Brzeg on 19 May 1577, Joachim Frederick married with Anna Maria (b. Zerbst, 13 June 1561 - d. Brzeg, 14 November 1605), daughter of Joachim Ernest, Prince of Anhalt. They had six children: #George Ernest (b. Oława, 29 August 1589 – d. Oława, 6 November 1589). #John Christian (b. Oława, 28 August 1591 – d. Ostróda, 25 December 1639). #Barbara Agnes (b. Oława, 24 February 1593 – d. 24 July 1631), married on 18 October 1620 to Hans Ulrich von Schaffgotsch und zu Kynast und Greiffenstein, Baron of Trachenberg and Warmbrunn. #George Rudolf (b.

He was a Country Party, later National Party, member of the New South Wales Legislative Council from 1976 to 1978 and again from 1991 up until 2002. He died from liver cancer a week after his announced his retirement from Parliament. Biography Moppett was born in Sydney, and was a grazier and pastoralist before entering politics. On 13 October 1965 he married Helen Golsby, with whom he had two sons. He served thirteen years on Coonamble Shire Council, including one year as Deputy President. =National Party politics= Moppett was a member of the Country Party (later the National Party), and was on its Central Executive from 1971 to 1999, as vice-chairman 1972–1986 and chairman 1986–1991. He was also on the party's Federal Council 1978–1992. During the period of Doug Moppet's chairmanship, the National Party was faced with perhaps the greatest challenge in its history, the Joh for Canberra campaign, which was akin to civil war within the National Party. In moving a motion of condolence in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, National Party leader George Souris quoted a couple of paragraphs from the book written by Paul Kelly, The End of Certainty—Power, Politics and Business in Australia. Souris, quoting Kelly, said: > The Joh-for-Canberra push split the Nationals at their base. The Joh war was > conducted state-by-state. Joh's real opposition was the NSW National Party, > which had no intention of falling for Joh-power and was appalled by his > tactics. The NSW party was (Ian) Sinclair's power base, the home of a > successful state level coalition which aspired to win the next state > election and had a firm and competent state chairman, Doug Moppett. From the > start Moppett spoke for the NSW party in saying that coalition unity was > essential, that outside pressure on the party would be resisted, that proper > constitutional process would be followed in preselection, and that NSW would > not tolerate Queensland disruption of the federal coalition. In the war that > would engulf the National Party, the attack of the Queenslanders would be > met with an equally determined defence in NSW. This would prove fundamental > in breaking the Joh push.

Joh's weakness was induced partly by a secret deal struck in > Howard's office between the NSW National and Liberal Parties, and formally > embodied in a two-page signed document. Its effect was to lock Joh out of > the biggest state. =New South Wales state political biography= Following the death of Thomas Gleeson MLC, Moppett filled a casual vacancy in the New South Wales Legislative Council in 1976, serving until 1978. In June 1978, voters approved a referendum to introduce a directly elected Legislative Council – as previous appointments to the Council had been through party nomination. The 1978 general election was New South Wales' first elections to the New South Wales Legislative Council; that were held simultaneously with elections for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly. Moppett was not successful in retaining his seat in the Wranslide that saw an 8% swing to Labor under Premier Neville Wran. Moppett was an unsuccessful candidate for election to the Australian Senate at the 1983 federal election. He was re-elected to the Legislative Council in 1991 in a pre-selection battle that saw sitting Councillor Judy Jakins MLC lose National Party endorsement. In 1997, Moppett was involved in a motor vehicle accident in Coonamble in which 38-year-old mother Beth Fleming was killed. Moppett was injured and hospitalised. Nearly four months after that accident Moppett was charged with a number of driving offences, some of them serious. In May 2000, Moppett announced his intention to resign from Parliament should he be proven guilty. A trial eventually proceeded and, in 2000, Moppett was found not guilty by a jury on the serious driving charges. The lesser charges were listing for hearing in the Local Court in May 2002, but the prosecution advised that it was unable to deal with certain matters put before the court and another hearing date was set for 18 June 2002 – the day that Moppett eventually died. During his parliamentary career Moppett was renowned as a great orator and, in 1997, was appointed Deputy Opposition Whip. He retained this position until he announced his resignation from Parliament on 13 June 2002, dying at his home at Quambone, west of Coonamble, New South Wales a few days later on 18 June 2002.

The incident started with the appointment of Mishima Michitsune as governor. His rule was contested by two groups, one in Aizu and the other in the east of the prefecture, which remained separate until the end of 1882, when they were drawn together by their shared persecution. Fukushima Jiyūtō The Liberal Party (Jiyūtō) developed a significant organisation in Fukushima. Two branches, one in Aizu and another in the east of the prefecture were established in December 1881, two months after the Party itself was established. They were the largest party in the Fukushima Assembly, holding 24 out of the 62 seats, and also the most effectively organised. In addition, they had members in various positions of responsibility in both areas of influence: village heads (kochō), subdistrict heads (kuchō) and elected members of assemblies at village and subdistrict level. There were also a number of party members with positions of responsibility within the administration. According to Sato Jiro, Mishima had received three secret orders upon appointment: * To destroy the Jiyūtō * To develop his own party, the newly created Rikken Teiseitō * To build certain roads One of the first things Mishima did was to purge the administration of ninety members of Jiyūtō – this includes school teachers who were government employees. Action in Aizu Mishima started setting up the Aizu Rukugun Rengōkai (Six Aizu Districts' Joint Committee) to rubber stamp some controversial policies concerning the road he was building - and for which the local community would have to foot much of the bill. Mishima wanted this Rengōkai was to consist of thirty members, five from each district. However, the rules committee set up to supervise the election, decided to make the number of representatives from each district reflect the size of the population, and that they should be directly elected by all male taxpayers twenty years old or older. Although Mishima originally wanted to have indirect elections he accepted this, and by early March 46 members had been elected. This election was questioned by the Aizu Jiyūtō, and Igarashi Chikarasuke, the administrative head of Yama district, was sacked and replaced by Satō Jirō. When the Rengōkai met on 16 March, Nakajima Yuhachi was elected chairman. Two resolutions were accepted: * All Aizu residents between the ages of 15 and 60 (excluding the disabled and the widowed) should provide one day of corvée labour each month for a period of two years * Those disinclined to work could pay a substitute labour tax of fifteen sen a day for males, and 10 sen a day for females. Two conditions were added to this: * The Central government should grant supplementary funds * The corvée labourers should only work on flat land, with all work in the mountains and bridges being done by professionals. The Rengōkai did not deal with the course of the road, the level of supplementary funds from the government, or how the tax was to be gathered. In June it was discovered that the contribution from central government had been reduced from 260,000 yen to 98,000 yen. However, the government also agreed an interest free loan to the Teiseito of 196,000 Yen, which had recruited unemployed ex-Samurai and established its headquarters, the Nisshinkan.Furthermore, Mishima, suspended the Rengōkai, taking charge of the road building himself. Furthermore, the corvée labour and taxes were deemed to start in March. Igarashi and other Jiyūtō activists were able to get a majority of the Rengōkai to sign a petition for a special session of the Rengōkai to oppose these developments. This was accompanied by Jiyūtō activists proposing civil disobedience against the levies, principally in Yama, Kawanuma and Ōnuma districts. On 18 August the Jiyūtō members of the Rengōkai met in secret and resolved that Jiyūtō should organise more widespread and structured protests to the road building programme, utilising lawsuits and boycotts. That night the government reacted to the agitation by organising attacks on Jiyūtō activists while they were asleep. This is known as the Shimizuya jiken.

Written between 1921 and 1927, the first two works (Kammermusik No. 1 and Kleine Kammermusik — Little Chamber Music) are for small ensembles (12 piece and wind quintet respectively), and share the opus number 24. Kammermusik No. 2 to Kammermusik No. 5 (Opus 36) are for larger ensembles and are concertos. The final two works form Opus 46. As Calum MacDonald notes, the majority of the works are not 'chamber music' in the traditional sense of the word, as they require larger forces than normally understood by the term. Indeed, six are effectively concertos (Hindemith's subtitles say as much). However, in contrast to the much larger forces (and sounds) Hindemith previously employed, the works are very much chamber-styled if not truly chamber works.MacDonald, Calum, liner notes to complete Kammermusik recording by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra under Riccardo Chailly, 2-CD set, Decca 433816-2 (1992).

The tellers and bookkeepers were protesting unequal pay and unequal opportunities for advancement. The women were Doris Boshart, Irene Wallin, Sylvia Erickson Koll, Jane Harguth Groothuis, Sandi Treml, Teren Novotny, Shirley Solyntjes, and Glennis Ter Wisscha. They set up a picket line outside the bank when the wind chill was -70°F (-57 °C). One other employee, Lois Johnson, quit just before the strike began. \\"The women's strike caused stress for many in the Western Minnesota town of 14,000 people. Few outwardly showed support for the strike and the lawyer who took the women's case, John Mack, lost his position as county chair of the Republican Party.\\" From outside Willmar, women's and labor groups as well as private individuals supported the strike in various ways. In the summer of 1979 the Honorable E. Dorian Gadsden of the National Labor Relations Board issued a ruling on the complaint. The NLRB declared that the bank was guilty of unfair labor practices, but those practices did not cause the strike. The NLRB ruled that the strike was \\"economic\\". As a result there was no back pay and no guarantee of the women recovering their jobs. Rhoda R. Gilman, the author of The Story of Minnesota's Past observed that \\"across Minnesota and elsewhere, banks quietly began to make some changes.\\" In 1981 Lee Grant directed a documentary on the Willmar 8 entitled The Willmar 8.

It is about an expedition led by Lewis and Clark, which is sent to survey the territory that the United States has just acquired in the Louisiana Purchase from France. They are able to overcome the dangers they encounter along the way with the help of a Shoshone woman named Sacagawea. This is currently the only major American motion picture on the Lewis and Clark expedition (although there have been television documentaries on the subject). Many details are fictional, and the minor scene where the group reaches the Pacific Ocean reflects the low budget of the film. Plot An ambitious, historic attempt to explore and document an untamed American frontier unfolds in this rousing adventure drama. In 1803, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, with President Thomas Jefferson's blessing, embarked on the government-sponsored Lewis & Clark Expedition – an attempt to discover a water route connecting St. Louis, Missouri, with the Pacific Ocean. Their trek takes them through the magnificent, danger-filled territory of the Pacific Northwest, with guidance from the Shoshone woman Sacagawea.

Reception In 2011, Time Magazine rated The Far Horizons as one of the top ten most historically misleading films, in part due to its casting of caucasian Donna Reed as Native American Sacagawea, and the creation of a romantic subplot between her character and William Clark despite the fact that Sacagawea's husband, French- Canadian trader Toussaint Charbonneau, was in real life also a member of the expedition.Time Magazine review, January 26, 2011 See also *List of American films of 1955 ReferencesExternal links 1955 films 1950s historical adventure films 1950s Western (genre) adventure films American historical adventure films American Western (genre) adventure films American films English- language films Films directed by Rudolph Maté Films scored by Hans J.

Life and work = Early years = Karel Vladimir Truhlar was born on 3 September 1912 in Gorizia, a town in the former Austro-Hungarian Empire. His mother, Marija Malnerčič, came from Divača; his father, František Truhlař, of Czech origin, was a railway employee. During World War I, the family went to Jesenice in Upper Carniola in 1915, where they lived for some years in an attic. In the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, he attended primary school from 1918 to 1926, and was considered a clever and lively youth. Due to his excellent grades, and with the help of donors, he enrolled in a nine-year secondary school in Ljubljana, graduating in 1933. His high school period was intense for both his spiritual formation and literary vocation. During this period, Truhlar was heavily influenced by Professor Ernest Tomc. Truhlar also joined the Catholic associations Dijaški Orel (Students’ Eagle), and Marijina Kongregacija (Marian Congregation); later, he joined Mlajci (Young People). He was a leader of the Green Ties, a students’ movement which protested against the despotism of Alexander I. During his last year of high school, Truhlar decided to become a priest. He entered the diocesan seminary in 1933 to study philosophy, graduating after two years with the thesis Das Erkennen der Existenz (The Knowledge of Existence) at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome. This period is attributed to Truhlar's affirmation of Aleš Ušeničnik's philosophical theories. Truhlar returned to Ljubljana in 1936, where he continued his study of theology. Unsatisfied with the typical structure of theological study, he turned to the theories of Romano Guardini,Romano Guardini (1885–1968), was an Italian-born German Catholic priest, author, and academic. He was one of the most important figures in Catholic intellectual life in the 20th century. Maréchal, and other contemporary thinkers who promoted the existentialist aspect of philosophical research. Even though he was a student at the seminary, he had to perform his military obligations (July–December 1938) in Osijek, Croatia, where he learned more Serbo-Croatian. In his spare moments in the town, he started to read Vladimir Solovyov's works, which opened up to him infinite possibilities of a Christian philosophy built on the metaphysics of uni-totality. = Theology studies = Truhlar was ordered priest on 29 October 1939 and received his theology degree in June 1941, with the thesis \\"Der Vergöttlichungeprocess bei Vladimir Solovjëv\\" (The process of divinization in Vladimir Solovyov ). He spent World War II in Rome alternating short periods of specialization with the activity of spiritual guide at the seminary in Ljubljana. Here, he decided to dedicate himself to spiritual theology, but he also intensely cultivated the study of dogmatic, as testified by the essay \\"Nauk Vladimira Solovjëva o razvoju dogme (Vladimir Solovyov’s doctrine on the evolution of dogma), published in the academic journal Bogoslovni vestnik. In mid-1945, he followed the events of the Rožman’s faculty, first in Praglia (Padova), then in Alto Adige. On 18 November 1946, following the advice of father Augustine Bea, he entered the Society of Jesus. He spent his novitiate in Pullach from 1946 to 1948, where he met father Albert Stögger, who was entirely devoted to the connection between his human richness and Saint Ignatius' spirituality. In his school, Truhlar conceived the basis of his anthropology and of his Christology. In this environment, he took the path of experiential research, which Truhlar declined during his whole lifetime. Here, he learnt Christological humanism, known as the experience of the Absolute. In 1949, he received the invitation from the Gregorian to go to Rome to get integrated into the teaching group of that university. With the collaboration of Stögger, he prepared research on Saint Ignatius’ interiority, published in the Revue d’ascetique et de mystique (Journal of Asceticism and Mysticism). Furthermore, an extract of this work, titled \\"Das Gotfunden des hl. Ignatius in sein letzen Jahren\\", was judged as the exact interpretation of Saint Ignatius’ spirituality. And with this, along with four other essays, he introduced himself as \\"professor extra-ordinarius\\" at the Gregorian. He was a lecturer from 1950; he became a full professor in 1956. For a short time, Truhlar occupied the Chair of Mariology, but he later manifested to rector father Dezza the wish he could devote his research and his teaching exclusively to spiritual theology. Truhlar conceived studying as an action in the world; as for spiritual theology, he conceived it in a particular way as an initiation to the Christian experience.Vl. Truhlar, \\"Concetti fondamentali della teologia spirituale\\", Queriniana, Brescia, 1971, page 19. For five years of the 1960s, his lessons were attended by approximately 300 to 350 students from thirty national colleges. These activities also saw the participation of one hundred religious orders and congregations. Truhlar’s lessons covered a various range of topics, such as the spiritual theology of secularity and monasticism, the theology of work and of free time, the sacred and aesthetic absolute, politics, Weltanschauung, senses-spirit-experience, poetry, and spiritual life. His teaching evolved, passing from the analysis of single letters from St Paul to Christian humanism, from exquisitely religious topics to gnosology and aesthetics. In this, he always started from the distinction between a rational knowledge and an intellective, a-conceptual, and a-categorial knowledge.Vl. Truhlar, \\"Concetti fondamentali della teologia spirituale\\", Queriniana, Brescia, 1971, page 20. = Collaboration with Meddobje = For around ten years, he collaborated with the magazine Meddobje, published in Argentina. Here, he published the Christological essay \\"Razvijanje in križanje človeške narave\\" (Development and crucifixion of human nature, 1956) and the theological reflection \\"Preobražanje sveta in beg pred njim\\" (Transformation of the world and escape in front of it, 1956–57). In 1958, the collection of lyrics \\"Nova Zemlja\\" (The new land), and the essay \\"Krščanska doraslost\\" (Christian maturity) in Meddobje, was published in Buenos Aires. The following year, the reflection \\"Problem osebne pokorščine\\" (The problem of personal obedience) was published. In 1961, the poetic cycle of the Baptist followed by the essay-commentary \\"Revolucija, konservatorizem in življenje kulture\\" (Revolution, conservatism and life of the culture) was published in Meddobje. In the same year, his second poetic collection, \\"Rdeče bivanje\\" (The red existence), was published by SKA (Cultural Slovenian Action) in Buenos Aires.Cultural association of Slovenian emigrants. In an interview on 24 May 1965, he claimed that internal events in Slovenia were misunderstood by some anti-communist writers; this caused tensions inside the SKA. Refused by Meddobje, the interview was published in Trieste by the review \\"Mladika\\" with the title \\"Pogovor pod Kvirinalom\\" (1966). At the end of 1969, in Celje, it was printed at \\"Mohorjeva Družba \\"V dnevih šumi Ocean\\" (In the days the Ocean whispers), a republication of his previous collections reviewed and ordered in seven sections and two cycles. In 1971, he published the \\"Concetti fondamentali della teologia spirituale\\", where the peculiar features of his gnosology and ontology emerged. In 1973, his second lyrical collection, \\"Luč iz črne prsti\\" (The light from black silt), was published. In the same year, he published \\"Lessico di spiritualità\\", where the terms of the Catholic ethos were revisited from a modern perspective. = Later years and death = At the end of 1974, at the age of 62 – after having spent 25 years in Rome devoted to an intense didactic and research activityO. Simčič, \\"L’assoluto nel pensiero e nell’esperienza di Vladimir Truhlar\\", \\"Iniziativa isontina\\", Gorizia, Anno XIX, n. 1/68, aprile 1977, pp. 62-63. – Truhlar went back to his native country to Dravlje, a suburb of Ljubljana. His last years were marked by attacks from the conservative clergy, who were reluctant to the conciliar innovations, and Yugoslavian police – even though he was guaranteed free speech. He left Dravlje in June 1976 to retreat in voluntary exile to Bolzano. He suddenly died there from cerebral ischemia on the morning of 4 January 1977. After his death, for the interest of his sister Zora and faithful student Lojze Bratina, an essay \\"Doživljanje absolutnega v slovenskem leposlovju\\" (The story of absolute in Slovenian literature), and two unpublished collections of lyrics \\"Motnordeči glas\\" (The murky red voice) and \\"Kri\\" (Blood) were published. Two other works, written with Professor G. Thils of the Catholic University in Leuven, were also published: \\"Laïcat et sainteté I.\\" Laïcs et la vie chrétienne parfaite (1963), and \\"Laïcat et sainteté II.\\" Sainteté et vie dans le siècle.

As with all notes with stems, sixteenth notes are drawn with stems to the right of the notehead, facing up, when they are below the middle line of the musical staff (or on the middle line, in vocal music). When they are on the middle line (in instrumental music) or above it, they are drawn with stems on the left of the note head, facing down. Flags are always on the right side of the stem, and curve to the right. On stems facing up, the flags start at the top and curve down; for downward facing stems, the flags start at the bottom of the stem and curve up. When multiple sixteenth notes or eighth notes (or thirty-second notes, etc.) are next to each other, the flags may be connected with a beam, like the notes in Figure 2. Note the similarities in notating sixteenth notes and eighth notes. Similar rules apply to smaller divisions such as thirty-second notes (demisemiquavers) and sixty- fourth notes (hemidemisemiquavers). In Unicode, U+266C (♬) is a pair of beamed semiquavers. The note derives from the semifusa in mensural notation. However, semifusa also designates the modern sixty-fourth note in Spanish, Catalan and Portuguese.

It was adapted into True Blood first season. Dead Until Dark, like the rest of the series, is narrated by Sookie Stackhouse, a telepathic waitress from the small fictional Louisiana town of Bon Temps, not far from the non-fictional town of Shreveport. It is set during the early 2000s, approximately the same time as the book's publication. In the world of the novel, vampires (and other supernatural creatures) are a reality. Sookie Stackhouse falls in love with the vampire, Bill Compton, whom she met at the diner she works at, Merlotte's, owned by Sam Merlotte. At some point in the recent past, Sookie tells us, the invention of synthetic blood, called Tru Blood, has made it unnecessary for vampires to feed on humans for sustenance, thus allowing the world's previously underground vampire community to reveal its existence to humans. Also relevant to plot development is the fact that vampire blood accelerates healing, increases strength, improves the libido, and make the person who drinks it better-looking.

September 2005 Events in the United States=Watchful waiting= After seeing no improvement in the situation in the weeks following the first protests, representatives of the American Jewish Committee, American Jewish Congress and B'nai B'rith met in New York City and established a joint committee to monitor the plight of German Jewry. At that point, they were in agreement that further public protests might harm the Jews of Germany. =Mass meetings= Unrelenting Nazi attacks on Jews in Germany in subsequent weeks led the American Jewish Congress to reconsider its opposition to public protests. In a contentious four-hour meeting held at the Hotel Astor in New York City on March 20, 1933, 1,500 representatives of various Jewish organizations met to consider a proposal by the American Jewish Congress to hold a protest meeting at Madison Square Garden on March 27, 1933. An additional 1,000 people attempting to enter the meeting were held back by police. New York Supreme Court Justice Joseph M. Proskauer and James N. Rosenberg spoke out against a proposal for a boycott of German goods introduced by J. George Freedman of the Jewish War Veterans. Proskauer expressed his concerns of \\"causing more trouble for the Jews in Germany by unintelligent action\\", protesting against plans for mass meetings and reading a letter from Judge Irving Lehman that warned that \\"the meeting may add to the terrible dangers of the Jews in Germany\\". Honorary president Rabbi Stephen Samuel Wise responded to Proskauer and Rosenberg, criticizing their failure to attend previous AJCongress meetings and insisting that \\"no attention would be paid to the edict\\" if mass protests were rejected as a tactic. Wise argued that \\"The time for prudence and caution is past. We must speak up like men. How can we ask our Christian friends to lift their voices in protest against the wrongs suffered by Jews if we keep silent? … What is happening in Germany today may happen tomorrow in any other land on earth unless its is challenged and rebuked. It is not the German Jews who are being attacked. It is the Jews.\\" He characterized the boycott as a morally imperative expression, stating, \\"We must speak out,\\" and that \\"if that is unavailing, at least we shall have spoken.\\" The group voted to go ahead with the meeting at Madison Square Garden.Staff. \\"NAZI FOES HERE CALMED BY POLICE; Hotel Congested by Delegates Seeking to Join in Protest of Jewish Congress.

The plot revolves around Tomoki Sakurai, a boy who desires to live a peaceful life but encounters a fallen girl with wings, named Ikaros, who becomes his servant. The manga began monthly serialization in the May 2007 issue of manga magazine Shōnen Ace and concluded with the March 2014 issue. The first tankōbon was released by Kadokawa Shoten on September 26, 2007, with a total of 20 volumes released. An anime adaptation produced by AIC aired in Japan in 2009, followed with a second season, a feature film, and two video games. A second film was released in Japan on April 26, 2014. The anime is licensed in North America by Funimation. Plot Tomoki Sakurai is a perverted teenage boy whose motto is \\"Peace and quiet are the best\\", and often has dreams of meeting an angel. He finds it difficult to live in comfort when he has to put up with Sohara Mitsuki, his next-door neighbor with a killer karate chop; Eishiro Sugata, an eccentric pseudo-scientist bent on discovering the \\"New World\\"; and Mikako Satsukitane, their school's sadistic student council president. One night, while he was witnessing a strange anomaly in the sky, a UMA (Unidentified Mysterious Animal) crash-landed nearby. Tomoki discovers that what fell from the sky is a winged female humanoid named Ikaros from an unknown world of Synapse, who soon declares herself to be Tomoki's servant. From then on, more creatures known as \\"Angeloids\\" arrive; with this, he loses his peace and quiet, but at the same time finds pleasant things the Angeloids bring him, and fight the forces that fall upon Earth. Characters=Main= ; : :Tomoki is a teenage boy who wants nothing more than a peaceful and quiet life in Sorami City. He has had recurring dreams of meeting an angel since childhood. Despite being a shameless pervert, a trait heavily influenced by his grandfather and mother, Tomoki is described as a kind and sincere person. He strives to make Ikaros and the resident Angeloids behave more like humans by having them not be so focused on obedience, and telling them to make their own decisions. He is usually drawn in chibi parameters, except when he is serious or relaxed. Tomoki occasionally uses a device that transforms him into a girl named . ; : :The title character and main heroine of the series, Ikaros is a beautiful gynoid known as an Angeloid. are a series of gynoids from Synapse that have wings like Angels. They are programmed to serve their masters using a process called \\"imprinting\\", represented by neck collar and chain that extends to her chosen master's hand. Each Angeloid is designated with a letter of the Greek alphabet, and can be programmed with abilities and powers that are a function of three main parameters: battle capability, emotional control and processing capability. The Angeloids' names, weapons, and abilities are primarily derived from Greek gods and mythological figures. She falls from the sky at the beginning of the story. After Tomoki recovers her, she forms a bond with him and calls him master: the imprinting is symbolized by a chain from her collar to his hand. She has an expressionless face that makes the other characters wonder if she will ever smile. Her emotions develop slowly, due to her programmed setting of high battle abilities and high processing abilities but low emotional abilities. Despite this, she develops genuine feelings of love for Tomoki. She also goes along with any of his perverted schemes, and eventually burns up into nothing after carrying Tomoki to Synapse, showing him her smile for the first time. She and the others are later resurrected by Tomoki's final wish. Although she initially states she is a \\"Pet-Class\\" (entertainment-purposed) Angeloid, she is actually a \\"Strategic Battle-Class\\" Angeloid. In her previous visit to Earth as the , she destroys the Tower of Babel. In \\"Battle Mode\\", she employs: , an energy shield sphere; , which fires an array of energy projectiles from her wings; and , a bow that fires an arrow of mass destruction. In Uranus Queen mode, she can interface with massive weapons platform called the Uranus System (Hephastus System in the Funimation dub). In a later battle, she evolves into Ikaros Version II with \\"Dual Variable Wings\\" that boost her power. Her name comes from the Greek mythological character Icarus, a craftman's son who flew too close to the sun and fell from the sky. ; : :Sohara is Tomoki's next door neighbor and childhood best friend. She gets annoyed whenever Tomoki acts in a lecherous manner and typically punishes him with a single karate chop. As a child, she was constantly ill and only had Tomoki as a friend. Despite all the punishment she dishes out to him, she secretly loves him, and has embarrassing lustful dreams about him.. She is good at sports, but struggles heavily with English (Spanish in the Funimation dub), and is a deadly cook when it comes to sunny- side up eggs. Eventually, Daedalus reveals that she created Sohara: the girl who died from a childhood illness was Daedalus's original avatar, and the girl who grew up with Tomoki was a clone she made so that he would not forget her. ; : :Sugata is the leader of the at Tomoki's school. He is an eccentric explorer and scientist who enjoys hang-gliding and living in the wilderness. In the anime, he opens the episodes with some philosophical narrations which reference historical explorers such as Magellan and Columbus. He is best friends with Mikako Satsukitane. He behaves in a generally deadpan manner unless it involves the \\"New World\\", or his family background. Prior to the events of the series, he is the son of a renowned political family. When his elder brother died from a hang-gliding accident, Eishiro takes blame and is disowned by his family. Leaving his younger brother the sole heir. Since then he has followed his elder brother's footsteps in discovering a \\"New World\\" as a way of atoning for his misdeed. ; : :Mikako is an upperclassman to Tomoki and Mitsuki and the student body president. She is a childhood friend of Sugata, whom she calls \\"Ei-kun\\", and is the daughter of an influential yakuza boss in Sorami. She is manipulative, cunning, highly intelligent, athletic and sadistic. She initiates many schemes in the form of festival competitions that place Tomoki in humiliating situations for her amusement. Unlike Sohara and the Angeloids, she directs her romantic affections towards Sugata, and claims him during the mock wedding in the second anime season finale. ; : :Nymph is an . She is introduced when she finds Ikaros on an errand and attacks her, then later mysteriously appears in Tomoki's living room where she casually snacks on chips. She has a condescending attitude towards humans, whom she refers to as \\"bugs\\", and she calls Angeloids by their types rather than their names. For example, she calls Ikaros \\"Alpha\\". Despite the attitude, she starts enjoying everyday life and her favorite hobby is eating snacks and watching soap operas. :Nymph's original mission was to retrieve Ikaros and return her to Synapse, however, she is physically weaker than her and fails in the mission after awakening Ikaros's Uranus Queen ability, and is consequently heavily punished and abused. After spending time with Tomoki and his friends, she begins to like humans, and soon develops feelings for Tomoki, albeit in an aloof fashion. Nymph eventually betrays Synapse: in the manga she tries to surprise attack the Harpies, while in the anime she sides with Ikaros. In both cases, her wings are consequently ripped off by the Harpies, but Tomoki and friends manage to free her from her link to her master. The wings regenerate when she accepts Tomoki as her new master. After the regrowth, Nymph needs to go through an Imprinting process required for her master; she eventually asks Tomoki, but he refuses and states that he wants her to live freely. :As an Electronic Warfare-type Angeloid, Nymph's allocation of abilities emphasize her high processing capabilities and high emotional control, but her raw battle power is set low. Nymph is able to hack computer systems as well as other Angeloids and even humans. She uses a device called the Dive Game which enables humans to enter each other's dreams and through Tomoki's dream, visit Synapse. Her \\"Stealth\\" wings appear sheer, unlike Ikaros's wings which can only retract to stubs, and she can use them as a radar. She can also fire a high-powered energy beam from her mouth called . During the battle with Angeloid Hiyori, Tomoki's encouragement allows her to upgrade her powers to , a \\"fundamental particle-jamming system\\" that she uses to hack and free Hiyori. She eventually faces Minos and self-destructs to destroy Zeus. :Nymph is named after and based on the nature spirits of Greek myth. ; : :Astraea is a large- breasted sent by Synapse to kill Tomoki. She is strong in combat and emotion compared to Ikaros, but because of that allocation, her weakness is her low processing power, and the other Angeloids consider her an idiot; this is affirmed when she bungles her multiple chances to kill Tomoki at the Buddhist temple, and later at the quiz show where she fails basic questions such as \\"what is 1+1\\". She is often famished because she does not know how to hunt or to obtain food by her own means; in one episode, she eats Sugata's fish bait. After spending time with Tomoki, she refuses Master's order to kill Nymph, and severs her own chain. :Astraea has a good relationship with her senpai sisters. Astraea eventually realizes that she too has fallen in love with Tomoki, after Chaos questions her on the definition of love. In recent chapters, she becomes depressed from losing her weapon and shield, but is encouraged by Tomoki who tells her only she can decide whether or not she is useless. She then decides to rescue her younger sister, Chaos. :According to Daedalus, Astraea is extremely quick and has great close-combat capabilities but is vulnerable to long-range attacks. She wields a super-oscillating photon blade called , which can even penetrate Ikaros's Aegis defense system. For defense, she uses , a shield that is more powerful than Ikaros's version, but guards a limited angle and can only be deployed for a short period. However, in her fight with Ikaros Melan, Astraea's sword and shield are destroyed. Towards the end of the story, she battles Chaos where she evolves her weapon and shield, and they both are killed. :Astraea is named after the Greek mythological figure Astraea, who was a goddess of justice that later became the constellations Virgo and Libra. ; : :Hiyori is a second-year student at Tomoki's school whose story is detailed in Heaven's Lost Property the Movie: The Angeloid of Clockwork. She has feelings for Tomoki and joins the New World Discovery Club in order to get closer to him. In reality, Hiyori is an Angel who was first seen inside some sort of sleeping chamber when Sugata went to Synapse. The chamber connects her to her body on Earth, which functions like an avatar. Sugata is hesitant in letting her join his club, but welcomes her upon hearing the club would receive more funding. Tomoki puts Hiyori through a false initiation to assess her purity. Thus far, only Sugata, Nymph, and Ikaros are aware of Hiyori's true identity. :Hiyori gets rather embarrassed when it is suggested that she and Tomoki are an item; while she likes Tomoki, she has not considered dating him yet, and her presence becomes a source of major discomfort for Sohara, Nymph, and Astraea. This stems from the realization that Hiyori is always kind and caring to Tomoki, while the others seem to only see his \\"faults\\". Eventually, Hiyori manages to confess her feelings to Tomoki, which leaves him in shock as no girl has ever confessed to him before. However, her time with Tomoki is ultimately cut short when a sleepy truck driver runs her over, which causes her avatar to disappear and her existence to be erased from everyone's memories (except for Tomoki and the Angeloids). :Hiyori is later converted to a \\"Type Zeta\\" Angeloid who works for the Master of Synapse to destroy the city. She uses a staff, called , which has the power to manipulate the weather by changing the air pressure, and thus knocking people unconscious. She is also able to counter-hack Nymph, but eventually loses when Nymph evolves into Aphrodite mode. After she is freed from Master, Hiyori remains on Earth and quits the New World Discovery Club. As she has accomplished her goal of getting close to Tomoki, she leaves him with a farewell kiss, although she continues to harbor feelings for Tomoki. She later gives Chaos the ability to fully grasp emotions, at the cost of her own life. =Synapse= is a land located in the skies that is home to the Angels and the Angeloids. It was first introduced in the series as a black hole above Sorami. Nymph has a device called the Dive Game that creates a portal between Sorami and Synapse via Tomoki's dreams. In the Synapse, there is a large dome that contains numerous Angels in sleeping pods, which connects them to their real-world avatars. If the avatar in the real world is killed, the people associated with them will have their memories erased, such as the case with Hiyori. Also in the Synapse is a large obelisk called the Rule which grants people wishes and creates the cards that the Angeloids use. ; : :Daedalus is an angel that frequently appears in Tomoki's dreams, but she flies away, which makes Tomoki cry. She comes to his dreams and asks him to help save her, and later sent Ikaros to him from the sky. It appears that she greatly cares for Tomoki. Her name originates from the Greek mythological character Daedalus, the father of Icarus. Her face is obscured in all of her appearances. It is later revealed she's the creator of the first generation of Angeloids: Ikaros, Nymph, the Harpies, and Astraea. She helps Sugata when he visits Synapse. She eventually reveals to Tomoki that she is in fact the real Sohara. The other Sohara was her incarnations: the child Sohara was her avatar that died from sickness (similar to Hiyori's case), and that the Sohara who grew up with him was a healthy replica to watch over him afterwards. In addition to creating the Angeloids, she created the \\"Rule\\" obselisk that grants wishes and the cards that go with it. ; : :The sadistic and ruthless ruler of Synapse, Master enjoys torturing the Angeloids he owns (both physically and emotionally); he sees them as merely his playthings which he can do as he pleases, and discard as trash. He is condescending towards humans, and refers to them as \\"Downers\\", a trait that is also shared with his Angeloids. Because of his arrogance and belief that the Angeloids will always obey his orders, he is surprised when he witnesses one of them break their chain or go against his orders. He is usually seated at a throne with two Angeloids beside him. Like Daedalus, his face is mostly obscured in his appearances. He also creates an \\"Ultimate Air Defense System\\" called . His real name is later revealed to be , named after the king of Crete in Greek mythology. In the final chapter of the series, Tomoki punches him with the strength of the Angeloids' core. As Minos stabs himself, Tomoki advises him that he should try coming to Earth. ; : :A pair of , who answer directly to the Master of Synapse. They are responsible for tearing off Nymph's wings and are also guards at Synapse's lab. They are equipped with a \\"High-Fever Object Compression Anti-Aircraft Gun\\" on their left arm called , which fires white- hot projectiles of at , and a \\"Super Vibration Claw\\" called mounted on their right arm. They are named and modeled after the harpies of Greek mythology. After Master orders them to attack Ikaros for his amusement, but they are interrupted by Tomoki, who tells them to dress up; the younger is embarrassed, but the older plays along until they get to a bikini where she becomes extremely conscious about showing her belly button that she flees. Later at the beach, the older harpy discovers she cannot survive being underwater, but was rescued by Tomoki and friends. After she and Tomoki were stranded in a desert, the older harpy develops feelings for him and questions her mission. The younger harpy decides to continue the mission; she fights Ikaros on her own, until the older harpy rejoins her. They eventually force themselves inside Ikaros's Aegis shield and self-destruct by detonating their collars. This causes the Master of Synapse great distress, and causes Tomoki to lock himself in his room in depression. ; : :Chaos is a and a major antagonist of the series. She initially appears to Tomoki as a girl in a nun's outfit. Chaos can change her appearance to mimic someone dear to her victim in order to instill turmoil and confusion (as her name implies), as she did against Nymph (and Ikaros) by taking on the likeness of Tomoki. Her \\"wings\\" are a wicked array of bladed, almost organic-like appendages. Unlike the first generation Angeloids who lack the ability to sleep, Chaos can enter another person's dream, as she has initially done with Tomoki. Chaos has a strange obsession with love, often asking the person what love is, to which Ikaros responded that love, for her, was a sensation of pain in her reactor, obviously in a figurative sense. :Chaos's first mission is to retrieve Ikaros' core. She lures Nymph by deceptively posing as Tomoki and then orders her to kill herself. She also fights and defeats the other first generation Angeloids, except for Ikaros who sends Chaos into an ocean chasm where she was temporarily incapacitated due to the great water pressure. While there, she concludes that love equates to pain. Chaos was left in the abyss, where she dismembers and devours fish to \\"grow bigger\\" and \\"to show her 'love' to everyone\\". She easily devours Seiren, one of the Sky Master's Angeloids, and uses the Pandora program to evolve into Chaos Version 2. She continues to question love by following Tomoki around a bit, but returns to her master only to be shot down by the Zeus cannon, and after overhearing Tomoki tell his Angeloids to go away, decides to return to the ocean floor to express her love more. She later returns to devour the dark Angeloids; she acquires their powers, yet holds back from attacking Tomoki because of her feelings for him, and her desire to be accepted by him as a \\"good girl\\". She retreats to the ocean. :Chaos later returns to absorb Hiyori. She gains a small understanding of right and wrong, and is directed by Hiyori to kiss Tomoki. She visits Tomoki and reveals herself to be an Angeloid, but their conversation is interrupted by Nymph, who had discovered Hiyori's body thinking she killed her. In the ensuing fight, Tomoki steps in the way of Chaos' wing and is impaled in the back. Chaos retreats to the river bank with a desire to \\"start it all over\\" when she encounters Sugata. After using too much of her powers, Chaos' body explodes, taking Astraea with her. After Tomoki resurrects everyone, Tomoki welcomes Chaos to his household, where she finally realizes what love is. :In the Sora no Otoshimono: Forte anime, after Chaos is plunged into the sea, she emerges as an adult and fights Nymph and Astraea; she easily overpowers them, until Ikaros arrives. She was later defeated by Astraea and Ikaros, who use their upgraded weapons (courtesy of Nymph) and briefly shuts down, after which Tomoki installs on her chain a padlock device given to him by Daedalus, who then restores Chaos to her child form. Chaos then joins the cast as the newest resident of Tomoki's household. ; :Oregano, also known as , is one of the mass-produced from a village in Synapse who mysteriously manages to come to Earth by tagging along with Eishiro when he teleports back from one of his trips. She seems to have common sense with Tomoki. Mikako takes her in afterwards (even giving her the ability to speak, a first since her Angeloid type are usually mute), as Tomoki does not have enough money to support another Angeloid. While Tomoki and Nymph are initially concerned that Mikako would abuse Oregano, they find her initially generally courteous and well- mannered, that is, until Tomoki leaves; then Oregano acts particularly vicious to Nymph by serving her vile food, insulting her, and trapping her in a cell full of ecchi animals (frogs licking, eels squirming) while dumping a bunch of grenades on her, all the while spinning the situations as if it were all Nymph's fault. She later reveals that Nymph used to visit her village and forced everyone to listen to her horrible singing, explaining why Oregano greatly dislikes her. She prefers to hang out with people (like Tomoki) who desire peace and quiet. ; :Ikaros Melan, or \\"Black Ikaros\\", is a is introduced as a dark winged copy of Ikaros that possesses a Variable Wing core designed by the Master of Synapse. As a Second-Generation Angeloid, Ikaros Melan is stronger than her original: Astraea's Chrysaor breaks on her Aegis shield, and her counter-punch breaks Astraea's Aegis L shield. Ikaros Melan is eventually destroyed when the real Ikaros is hit with Ikaros Melan's Apollon arrow, after which Ikaros traps both in her Aegis shield just before the arrow explodes. She and the other dark Angeloids are then consumed by Chaos.. However, a group of Ikaros Melans were seen attacking Yoshitsune Hououin when he accidentally found himself in Synapse. Minos has since generated an army of melan angeloids to guard Synapse. Some of his Melan angeloids are modeled after Nymph and Astraea. ; :Seiren is a \\"Underwater Warfare Angeloid\\", able to swim in water as deep as 8000 meters. She is based on the sirens from the Greek mythology, and was designed by the Master of Synapse. Her appearance in the manga is brief, as when she attacks Tomoki, Chaos suddenly appears and consumed her. =Humans= ; : :Tomoki's equally perverted grandfather, whose dream was to sleep with every woman in the world, but could not do so before his death. He usually appears when Tomoki is in a dire situation, usually as a flashback or some supernatural phonomena, to give him albeit perverted advice. The manga features a recurring gag where Tomoki (and sometimes a friend) would be killed after doing something perverted; grandpa would meet them in the afterlife and tell them to \\"go home\\" (back to life). ; :Tomoki's perverted mother; her appearance resembles Tomoki's female alter ego, Tomoko. Tomoyo and her husband left Tomoki on a \\"world tour\\" when he was only 10 years old, prior to the series' start. When she reunites with her son, she harasses Astraea and some of the other girls by fondling their breasts, and then flirts with Sugata, which enrages Mikako. She is finally stopped by her husband and then resumes her world tour with him. ; :Tomoki's father who briefly appears at the end of chapter 49 of the manga. Tsutsumi is very much like Sohara in that he packs a powerful karate chop that he uses on his wife for her pervertedness. Tsutsumi was actually married into the Sakurai family, while Tomoyo is the descendant of the Sakurai bloodline. ; and :Yoshitsune :Tsukino :Yoshitsune Hououin is the guy from the rival school that competes against Tomoki's school during the cultural festivals. He comes from a wealthy family, although, in a public showdown against Mikako, his fortune cannot rival Mikako's \\"black money\\". Tsukino is his little sister who always looks up to him, that is, until Yoshitsune acts like a pervert by flipping a girl's skirt. Tomoki and friends try to help him reconcile with his sister while still acting like a man. He also notices that Sugata is hiding something about his past. He later sacrifices himself to the Ikaros Melans to protect Sugata when he is in Synapse. ; / : :A mysterious visitor who minds a pigeon-covered booth that bears the name JUDAS. He regularly appears during the Satsukitane festivals to foil any chances Tomoki has of winning the event; he usually overpowers him with his pair of pistols. He is directly based on the title character in the Judas manga that Minazuki worked on prior to this series. In the manga, he is never mentioned by name, but in the anime he is credited by Shooting Range ManSora no Otoshimono, episode 8 or Zero in the Japanese dub, and Judas in the English dub.Sora no Otoshimono Forte anime, episode 3 Production In 2006, Suu Minazuki's previous manga Judas had ceased publication in Kadokawa Shoten's Shōnen Ace magazine with a total of five volumes. Minazuki had also wrapped up his fantasy harem comedy series Watashi no Messiah-sama in 2007, for which he started a sequel Watashi no Kyūseishu-sama ~lacrima~ which ran for 35 chapters in Monthly GFantasy in 2007–2008. These works were set in fantasy worlds with some references to Biblical characters and settings; Minazuki briefly alludes to the Tower of Babel in the history of the Angeloids. Minazuki's Angeloid characters and weapons in Sora no Otoshimono are primarily named after characters in Greek mythology, including their classifications sequentially pulled from the Greek alphabet. In 2008, Minazuki started a seinen water adventure series called Seven Ocean, but only six chapters were published. As the publication of Sora no Otoshimono was geared for a wider shōnen audience, Minazuki made some adjustments such as posting warnings to his readers to skip the chapter when it contains obvious nudity themes, and placing censor boxes and ovals over exposed body parts. Yoshihiro Watanabe, who worked on Brighter than the Dawning Blue and Bamboo Blade handled the Character Design and served as the Chief Animation Director for the first anime series. Hisashi Saito, who also directed Bamboo Blade, handled the Direction for the anime series as well as the OVA and the feature film.

Reception Tim Jones of T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews stated that the anime show \\"Dangles between the line of guilty pleasure and stupid, but manages to be an entertaining series all the same.\\" and is actually funny in comparison to DearS, with \\"decent fanservice, amusing characters, and doesn't revolve entirely around subservient alien girls\\", however, he is critical of the tacked on fanservice, and dislikes Mikako's terrible character, \\"basically a two-faced bitch\\" whose smirks imply a \\"mean-spirited, unfunny joke coming out of her mouth.\\" Chris Beveridge of Mania.com wrote that the second anime series \\"provides the kind of humor that's good to have once and certainly not what I want out of a lot of series, but the staff here has hit just about everything right (outside of that awful wrestling episode).\\" Theron Martin of Anime News Network wrote that the second series was sporadically enjoyable, with much of the attempts at humor and fanservice to be abysmally poor, although he enjoyed the English dub's voice work. Dennis Amith of J!-ENT considered the series \\"Intriguingly perverse, reminiscent of Urusei Yatsura and Chobits\\" and appealing to harem and fan service anime fans, but \\"enjoyed with every episode, the voice talent singing songs via anime theme songs from the ’70s, ’80′s and modern-style themes\\". Following the anime episode ending that involved flying panties, Rocket Girls creator Hōsuke Nojiri created a rubber band powered ornithopter in the shape of the panties, and posted the video on Nico Nico Douga where it soon became popular. NKH (Niconico's live streaming station) and a local school (Niconico Technical Community) then hosted a Sora Fes event on March 6, 2010, where participants built and flew model airplanes in the likeness of the flying panties. Nojiri, along with OpenSky's media artist Kazuhiko Hachiya, director Hisashi Saito, and TBS announcer Jun Suzuki also attended the event.  translated from the Japanese article posted on March 8, 2010 With the broadcast of the Sora No Otoshimono Forte anime season, the January 2011 issue of Newtype featured Ikaros as the most popular female character, with Nymph at #7 and Astraea at #9. Tomoki Sakurai was also listed as #5 for most popular male character in that month. Streaming broadcaster Crunchyroll reported that Sora No Otoshimono Forte ranked #3 in popularity of their top 10 anime broadcasts in the Fall of 2010.

Travelogue writer, brother of more noted Ivan, the writer of the well-known epic Smrt Smail-age Čengića. He attended a German school in his native town, where he was trained to become a blacksmith. Often he indulged into travels (Montenegro, Serbia), and exceptionally in a few occasions to Bosnia. In 1841 he was back to Novi, practicing his craft and agriculture, but also engaging in literature and cultural issues in general. In 1847 he ended up in Vienna, in 1848 again in Bosnia (in Sarajevo, at the court of Fazli-paša Šerifija). At the end of 1848, in a letter addressed to his brothers he says: \\"I don't know when I shall return home, for I have been, I'm afraid, created for this country. TurksIn the 19th century the term Turk (Croatian: Turčin, Turak) could refer both to Ottoman Turks, and to Islamicised Slavs that today refer themselves them as Bosniaks. are very fond of me for my prudence, they say, and rayah grows ever more trust in me, and therefrom there is no other outcome but mitre on the head or a stake in the arse\\".\\"Ja ne znam kad ću se povratiti kući, jer sam, bojim se, samo za ovu zemlju stvoren.

After Sarajevo, Matija went to Istanbul (though the exact dates cannot be ascertained), and according to some legends even further, to Suez and the Egypt. In 1852 Matija was back to Novi, where he settled until growing ill in 1879. He lived a secluded life until the symptoms of mind degeneration have started to show, finally dying in the sanatorium of a well-known psychiatrist Richard von Krafft-Ebing, near Graz, on April 17, 1881. As a writer Mažuranić was noted for his travelogue Pogled u Bosnu. During his 1839 travels to Bosnia (from Karlovac, Sisak and Kostajnica, over Belgrade, on foot and horse, to Sarajevo, Travnik, over Romanija up to Zvornik) – Mažuranić wrote a piece which can be read both as an adventure and as a realistic account of the seen and experienced. The travelogue intermixes author's views on the relationships between the Ottoman Turks and the Bosniaks, Islam and Christianity, with accounts of the customs of everyday life, images of vizier courts of agas and pashas, but also of folk meyhanes, contemplations on everyday life, love and death.

Three mountain climbers were killed and one sustained a serious shoulder injury. Two of the dead were from Northern Ireland and the other was from Scotland. Nine people from at least three countries in at least two parties were involved in the incident on a mountain that is well recognised by tourists to Scotland. While avalanches are not uncommon in the area, very few deaths are reported—this incident has been described as \\"one of the worst disasters in the Scottish mountains for decades\\". Geography Map of Glen Coe and environs. Two of the main summits of Buachaille Etive Mòr are marked as \\"Sb Dearg\\" and \\"Sb na Broige\\". The avalanche occurred in the Coire na Tulaich area of the mountain. Coire na Tulaich affords a relatively easy (but steep) ascent of the mountain in summer conditions and is also the main ascent route for hill walkers. This corrie has a history of previous avalanches. The last fatal avalanche before this incident occurred in February 1995, resulting in the deaths of at least six people. Buachaille Etive Mòr (which means \\"the great herdsman of Etive\\") is a popular destination for hill walkers and climbers. There are two Munros on the ridge of Buachaille Etive Mòr. Stob Dearg is the highest peak on the ridge and is the one seen from the A82 road, the other Munro summit being Stob na Bròige. Climbers According to John Grieve, the leader of Glencoe Mountain Rescue Team, the nine caught in the avalanche appeared to consist of two parties, one made up of seven friends, both Scottish and English, and a pair of climbers. Also a man with a serious shoulder injury. Search and rescue effort Following the avalanche at 12:00 UTC, a major search and rescue operation was carried out in blizzard conditions. Rescue helicopters were involved alongside members of Glencoe Mountain Rescue Team who were aided by detection dogs. First to arrive at the scene was the RAF rescue helicopter, Rescue 137, which had been diverted from an exercise in the area. A second helicopter, Rescue 177, was then scrambled from the Royal Navy station at HMS Gannet near Prestwick. Upon their discovery at 15:00 UTC, the three climbers were airlifted off the mountain and taken to the Belford Hospital in Fort William by ambulance where they were pronounced dead at 17:00 UTC. A fourth person airlifted to hospital sustained a shoulder injury, and the remaining five people found on the mountain were described as \\"uninjured\\". The rest of the climbers were left on the mountain for a period as weather conditions prevented the helicopters from re-engaging in their search efforts. Cause John Grieve said the avalanche was initiated by a climber who dislodged a huge sheet of snow, sending it down on the nine other climbers who were swept downhill. The climber avoided being swept away by digging into the mountain with his ice axe before he composed himself to alert the emergency services. The surviving climbers had begun to unearth their friends' bodies from the snow with their ice axes by the time the rescue team had arrived. Fifty-year- old Jim Coyne from Lindsayfield, East Kilbride, said he and 53-year-old David Barr from Paisley, were on the mountain when a slab of snow came away from the peak. Barr sustained the shoulder injury. Coyne told of how they were just below the summit when the avalanche occurred, describing it as \\"massive\\" and saying they were > ... engulfed and I managed to dig my way out. As I tried to get my bearings > I saw an arm sticking out of the snow. It was Davie. I dug for 10 minutes > using just my hands to get him free. 54-year-old Tom Richardson, an experienced climber from Sheffield in England, also had a narrow escape and subsequently alerted the emergency services. The three casualties were named as Eamonn Murphy, 61, John Murphy, 63 and Brian Murray.

It produced electricity using a thermionic converter. It had a Plazma-2 SPT electric engine. Its mission was to search the oceans for naval and merchant vessels, using radar. Unlike the earlier Soviet RORSAT satellites, Kosmos 1818 and its twin, Kosmos 1867, were launched into high orbits. This mitigated to possibility of mishaps resulting in uncontrolled re- entry of radioactive material, as had occurred with Kosmos 954 and Kosmos 1402, which showered the Earth with radioactive debris. In 1992, Kosmos 1818 had an approximate visual magnitude of 3.3. Fragmentation About July 4, 2008, either Kosmos 1818 was hit by an object or a coolant tube cracked due to thermal stresses by repeated solar heating. The US Space Surveillance Network reported that about thirty objects were formed. These have orbital periods ranging from 100.5 to 101.5 minutes. Some of the debris appears to be metallic spheres. These could have resulted from the NaK coolant. Russian Space Forces chief of staff General Alexander Yakushin indicated that the debris was high above the orbit of the International Space Station and did not pose any threat of radioactive contamination to the Earth.

He was a deputy state attorney general in Dover, Delaware from 1842 to 1850, and a city solicitor for Wilmington, Delaware. In 1849, he was elected to the Delaware House of Representatives, returning to private practice in Wilmington the following year. In 1861, he was named United States Attorney for the District of Delaware, a post that he held until 1866. Federal judicial service Bradford was nominated by President Ulysses S. Grant on December 11, 1871, to a seat on the United States District Court for the District of Delaware vacated by Judge Willard Hall. The following day, Bradford was confirmed by the United States Senate and received his commission. He served on the court until his death on January 16, 1884, in Wilmington. Family Bradford married Mary Alicia Heyward (1820-1848), the granddaughter of Thomas Heyward Jr., a signer of the Declaration of Independence for South Carolina.

Club career Bella made his league debut for Vélez Sársfield on a 0–0 draw against Independiente on 8 June 2008, during the penultimate fixture of that year's Clausura tournament. In 2009, the Argentine winger won with Vélez the 2009 Clausura, although only playing one game (a 1–1 draw against River Plate on the sixth fixture). Bella played 13 games in Vélez' 2010 Apertura runner-up campaign, mainly replacing Augusto Fernández on the right wing when the former was injured. However, coach Ricardo Gareca also used him as a left back to replace injured Emiliano Papa on the last fixtures of the tournament. Bella improved his goal-scoring ability in the first semester of 2012, scoring five times in 18 games between the 2012 Clausura and Copa Libertadores. Upon Augusto Fernández's departure from Vélez, Bella became a regular starter for Vélez and played 15 games (scoring once) in the team's 2012 Inicial title-winning campaign. In 2013, the winger suffered an epilepsy seizure on the field, but quickly recovered and started for Vélez in the 2012–13 Superfinal victory against Newell's Old Boys. In July 2013, Bella moved to Mexican club Chiapas F.C., that purchased 50% of his transfer rights from Vélez for a fee of approximately US$2 million. After a six-month period, he joined Puebla F.C. on loan. In July 2014, Bella returned to Argentina for Lanús, signed a one-and-a-half year deal. However, the midfielder left the club after only six months, joining Godoy Cruz for the 2015 Argentine Primera División. After another 6-month period with Godoy Cruz, the winger returned to his first team, Vélez Sarsfield, signing a two-year contract. In Vélez' first team he joined his brother Rodrigo. International career In January 2009, Bella played the South American Youth Championship with the Argentine under-20 national team. In 2012, Bella was called by coach Alejandro Sabella for a senior national team formed solely by local league players, although he did not play any games.

He is the elder of Fanny Dashwood's two brothers and forms an attachment to Elinor Dashwood. As first described in Sense and Sensibility: \\"Edward Ferrars was not recommended to their good opinion by any peculiar graces of person or address. He was not handsome, and his manners required intimacy to make them pleasing. He was too diffident to do justice to himself; but when his natural shyness was overcome, his behaviour gave every indication of an open, affectionate heart. His understanding was good, and his education had given it solid improvement. But he was neither fitted by abilities nor disposition to answer the wishes of his mother and sister, who longed to see him distinguished—as—they hardly knew what.\\" His personality, while it lacks the flash of Marianne Dashwood's romantic interest Willoughby, indicates more fortitude. Despite the good common sense that links him to Elinor, he is able to attach himself to other people and form bonds of friendship and love with ease. He exemplifies great loyalty when he sacrifices his potential happiness with Elinor to honor a promise he made to another girl when he was younger. He and Marianne's future husband Colonel Brandon are both models of great character under unimpressive exteriors. This simplicity makes them rather less three-dimensional than Pride and Prejudices Fitzwilliam Darcy and Emmas Mr. Knightley. He eventually marries Elinor after he is abandoned by Lucy Steele for his now propertied brother.

She measures 34'-7\\" long, has a beam of 8'-8\\" and has a centerboard. She is noted for her very tall masts, is privately owned, and races under No. 8. She is one of the last 22 surviving traditional Chesapeake Bay racing log canoes that carry on a tradition of racing on the Eastern Shore of Maryland that has existed since the 1840s. She is located at Kingstown, Queen Anne's County, Maryland. She was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. History Mystery was built in a barn in Oxford, MD, as a secret weapon to defeat the Flying Cloud in the Governor's Cup, hence the name, Mystery. Results were mixed and she was eventually re-rigged as a sloop in the late-40s and was used as a cruising boat. In 1955, she was purchased by John Whittum who sailed her all around the Chesapeake with her sloop rig until he re-rigged her for racing once again and began to compete in the log canoe regattas. He eventually won the Governor's Cup in 1962. In the mid-70s, John moved to Colorado, leaving the Mystery with Francis Schauber who had been racing with him since the early 60's. Francis raced her for several years, before purchasing it outright in 1975. He then began a full overhaul on her, which by then, had been in serious disrepair. He stripped down the hull to the bare logs, cut out all the rotten spots and replaced the waterlogged plywood decks. He also increased her sail area substantially. The foremast height was increased to 60 feet, making it the tallest mast ever for a log canoe under 35 feet long. Mystery would hold this record until Jay Dee unveiled her 63-foot foremast in 2012. Recent history Mystery has refurbished many times over the years. Besides the overhaul from 1976, the most substantial occurred in 2001 when 'cheeks' were added to her hull, with the desired effect to make her more stable. In 2008, Mystery lost her foremast in the CRYCC regatta in a heavy air race. The mast, which was over 30 years old at the time, was deemed unfixable and a new one was built in time for the last two regattas of the 2008 season. =2013 Racing Season= In 2013, after only participating in two regattas during the 2012 season, Mystery made it out for the RHYC log canoe regatta, with the intent to compete in the rest of the season. However, the following week, once again in the CRYCC regatta, she lost her foremast when the shroud snapped. The mast was repaired, however she was unable to complete the season. = 2014 Racing Season = Mystery did not participate in the 2014 Racing Season. Trivia In 1946, the owner at the time wanted to immortalize his son, who had been killed in World War II. For the racing season of that year, Mystery was temporarily renamed 'Memory'.

The formalism has been incorporated into the two major models used to describe coordination complexes; crystal field theory and ligand field theory, which is a more advanced version based on molecular orbital theory.  Standard electron configuration perspective  The electron configuration for transition metals predicted by the simple Aufbau principle and Madelung's rule has serious conflicts with experimental observations for transition metal centers under most ambient conditions. Under most conditions all of the valence electrons of a transition metal center are located in d orbitals while the standard model of electron configuration would predict some of them to be in the pertinent s orbital. The valence of a transition metal center can be described by standard quantum numbers. The Aufbau principle and Madelung's rule would predict for period n that the ns orbitals fill prior to the (n − 1)d orbitals. For example, the 4s fills before the 3d in period 4. In general chemistry textbooks, a few exceptions are acknowledged with only one electron in the ns orbital in favor of completing a half or whole d shell. The usual explanation is that \\"half-filled or completely filled subshells are particularly stable arrangements of electrons\\". An example is chromium whose electron configuration is [Ar]4s13d5 with a half-filled d subshell, although Madelung's rule would predict [Ar]4s23d4. Similarly copper is [Ar]4s13d10 with a full d subshell, and not [Ar]4s23d9. Matters are further complicated when metal centers are oxidized. Since the (n − 1)d shell is predicted to have higher energy than the ns shell, it might be expected that electrons would be removed from the (n − 1)d shell first. Experimentally it has been observed that not only are the ns electrons removed first, even for unionized complexes all of the valence electrons are located in the (n − 1)d orbitals. There are various hand waving arguments for this phenomenon including that \\"the ns electrons are farther away from the nuclei and thus ionized first\\" while ignoring results based on neutral complexes. This poor explanation avoids the basic problems with the standard electron configuration model. The standard electron configuration model assumes a hydrogen-like atom removed from all other atoms. This assumption is only truly relevant for esoteric situations. It is far more common for metal centers to have bonds to other atoms through metallic bonds or covalent bonds. These bonds drastically change the energies of the orbitals for which electron configurations are predicted. Thus for coordination complexes the standard electron configuration formalism is meaningless and the d electron count formalism is a suitable substitute.  Ligand field perspective  Ligand field scheme summarizing σ-bonding in the octahedral complex [Ti(H2O)6]3+. Crystal field theory describes a number of physical phenomena well but does not describe bonding nor offer an explanation for why ns electrons are ionized before (n − 1)d electrons. The more recent ligand field theory offers an easy to understand explanation that models phenomena relatively well. According to the model present by ligand field theory, the ns orbital is involved in bonding to the ligands and forms a strongly bonding orbital which has predominantly ligand character and the correspondingly strong anti-bonding orbital which is unfilled and usually well above the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). Since the orbitals resulting from the ns orbital are either buried in bonding or elevated well above the valence, the ns orbitals are not relevant to describing the valence. Depending on the geometry of the final complex, either all three of the np orbitals or portions of them are involved in bonding, similar to the ns orbitals. The np orbitals if any that remain non-bonding still exceed the valence of the complex. That leaves the (n − 1)d orbitals to be involved in some portion of the bonding and in the process also describes the metal complex's valence electrons. The final description of the valence is highly dependent on the complex's geometry, in turn highly dependent on the d electron count and character of the associated ligands. For example, in the MO diagram provided for the [Ti(H2O)6]3+ the ns orbital – which is placed above (n − 1)d in the representation of atomic orbitals (AOs) – is used in a linear combination with the ligand orbitals, forming a very stable bonding orbital with significant ligand character as well as an unoccupied high energy antibonding orbital which is not shown. In this situation the complex geometry is octahedral, which means two of the d orbitals have the proper geometry to be involved in bonding. The other three d orbitals in the basic model do not have significant interactions with the ligands and remain as three degenerate non-bonding orbitals. The two orbitals that are involved in bonding form a linear combination with two ligand orbitals with the proper symmetry. This results in two filled bonding orbitals and two orbitals which are usually the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) or the highest partially filled molecular orbitals – a variation on the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO).  Tanabe–Sugano diagram  Each of the ten possible d electron counts has an associated Tanabe–Sugano diagram describing gradations of possible ligand field environments a metal center could experience in an octahedral geometry. The Tanabe–Sugano diagram with a small amount of information accurately predicts absorptions in the UV and visible electromagnetic spectrum resulting from d to d orbital electron transitions. It is these d–d transitions, ligand to metal charge transfers (LMCT), or metal to ligand charge transfers (MLCT) that generally give metals complexes their vibrant colors.  Limitation  It is important to remember that the d electron count is a formalism and describes some complexes better than others. Often it is difficult or impossible to assign electrons and charge to the metal center or a ligand. For a high-oxidation-state metal center with a +4 charge or greater it is understood that the true charge separation is much smaller. But referring to the formal oxidation state and d electron count can still be useful when trying to understand the chemistry.  Possible d electron counts  There are many examples of every possible d electron configuration. What follows is a short description of common geometries and characteristics of each possible d electron count and representative examples. :d0 :Commonly tetrahedral; however it is possible for d0 complexes to accommodate many electron pairs (bonds/coordination number) since their d orbitals are empty and well away from the 18-electron ceiling. Often colorless due to the lack of d to d transitions. :Examples: titanium tetrachloride, titanocene dichloride, Schwartz's reagent. :d1 :Examples: molybdenum(V) chloride, vanadyl acetylacetonate, vanadocene dichloride, vanadium tetrachloride. :d2 :Examples: titanocene dicarbonyl. :d3 :Examples: Reinecke's salt. :d4 :Octahedral high-spin: 4 unpaired electrons, paramagnetic, substitutionally labile. :Octahedral low-spin: 2 unpaired electrons, paramagnetic, substitutionally inert. :d5 High-spin [Fe(NO2)6]3− crystal field diagram Low-spin [Fe(NO2)6]3− crystal field diagram :Octahedral high-spin: 5 unpaired electrons, paramagnetic, substitutionally labile. :Octahedral low-spin: 1 unpaired electron, paramagnetic, substitutionally inert. :Examples: potassium ferrioxalate, vanadium carbonyl. :d6 :Commonly octahedral complexes in both high spin and low spin. :Octahedral high-spin: 4 unpaired electrons, paramagnetic, substitutionally labile. :Octahedral low- spin: no unpaired electrons, diamagnetic, substitutionally inert. :Examples: hexamminecobalt(III) chloride, sodium cobaltinitrite, molybdenum hexacarbonyl, ferrocene, ferroin, chromium carbonyl. :d7 :Octahedral high spin: 3 unpaired electrons, paramagnetic, substitutionally labile. :Octahedral low spin: 1 unpaired electron, paramagnetic, substitutionally labile. :Examples: cobaltocene. :d8 :Complexes which are d8 high-spin are usually octahedral (or tetrahedral) while low-spin d8 complexes are generally 16-electron square planar complexes. For first row transition metal complexes such as Ni2+ and Cu+ also form five-coordinate 18-electron species which vary from square pyramidal to trigonal bipyramidal. :Octahedral high spin: 2 unpaired electrons, paramagnetic, substitutionally labile. :Square planar low spin: no unpaired electrons, diamagnetic, substitutionally inert. :Examples: cisplatin, nickelocene, dichlorobis(ethylenediamine)nickel(II), iron pentacarbonyl, Zeise's salt, Vaska's complex, Wilkinson's catalyst. :d9 :Stable complexes with this electron count are more common for first row (period four) transition metals center than they are for complexes based around second or third row transition metals centers. These include both four-coordinate 17-electron species and five-coordinate 19-electron species. :Examples: Schweizer's reagent. :d10 :Often tetrahedral complexes limited to form 4 additional bonds (8 additional electrons) by the 18-electron ceiling. Often colorless due to the lack of d to d transitions. :Examples: tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0), nickel carbonyl.

He was elected Fellow of the Linnean Society of London on 16 January 1838 and (posthumously) Fellow of the Geological Society of London on 30 November 1850. On 25 November 1832 in Port Royal he married Margaret McGowan, by whom he had two daughters. After his wife's death on 21 June 1843, he married Emma, by whom he had a son (John J.) and a daughter (Mary E.).Oliver, V.L. (1919) Caribbeana volume 5, page 39; London: Mitchell Hughes & Clarke.

Early life Macfayden was born in Glasgow on 3 May 1799, he was the eldest son of a music publisher and bookseller, John Macfadyen, and his wife Elisabeth. Career and civic involvement He studied medicine around 1818-21 at Glasgow University, where a lifelong interest in botany was sparked; but only in 1837 was he awarded the MD degree.Quoted from the biography of James Macfadyen in the history of Glasgow University, available online: http://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk His developing medical career was curtailed by his application - on the recommendation of Sir William Hooker, at that time Professor of Botany at Glasgow University - to become “island botanist” with a brief to establish a botanical garden on Jamaica. After his arrival there in August 1825, he embarked on a detailed study of its natural history, culminating in his two volumes of The Flora of Jamaica; the first was published at his own expense in Glasgow in 1837 and the second posthumously.Desmond, R. (1994) Dictionary of British and Irish Botanists and Horticulturalists, including Plant Collectors, Flower Painters and Garden Designers, London: Taylor & Francis.Volume II was never published. The sheets were being printed in Jamaica in 1850, and on the author's death were destroyed: only a few copies sent to correspondents are extant. He was the first to describe the grapefruit scientifically - he gave it its Linnean name, Citrus paradisi - and to describe new species of fig trees and other Caribbean plants. However his attempt in 1825-26 to establish a botanical garden in the area around Bath was unsuccessful, caused by a combination of poor soil there and inadequate financial support. Macfadyen set up a profitable medical practice on the island. Over the course of his 25 years on Jamaica, Macfadyen held many positions of responsibility, some related to his work and others of a social nature. His substantive post was as a medical practitioner, including being surgeon to the Female Penitentiary in Kingston. He also contributed to attempts to enhance the island's economy, by publicising his scientific work and its possible commercial applications. He was Assistant Judge or Magistrate in several parishes and he was President of the Kingston Philharmonic Society. He was also a committed freemason who held numerous senior positions in the charitable masonic lodges on the island. An oil painting of him dated 1842 survives in the art collection of the archives at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, London. He was elected Fellow of the Linnean Society of London on 16 January 1838 and (posthumously) Fellow of the Geological Society of London on 30 November 1850. He maintained contact with Sir William Hooker, who was later to become Director at Kew Gardens, by sending him accounts of his scientific studies and plant specimens over the period 1826-50.Director’s Correspondence, volumes 43, 69 and 70; on microfilms MRF/123 and MRF/150 at the archives of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, U.K. In letters to Sir William in 1849, Macfadyen complains about his inadequate “emoluments” that give him little time for botany and that prompt him to ask Hooker for help in securing alternative employment back in England. However he never left Jamaica. Whilst treating patients during one of the periodic epidemics of cholera there, he himself contracted the disease and died on 24 November 1850. A summary of his lifetime achievements appears in an obituary presented to the meeting of the Linnean Society on 24 May 1851.Proceedings of the Linnean Society 1848-55, volume 2, pages 135-6.

Accessed 2009-01-25. History In medieval times, the lands which now comprise the park abutted the manor of Herdwyck. The 18th century saw dramatic change: a new hall was built, and a new owner—a wealthy businessman from Tyneside named John Burdon—began to develop the grounds. Burdon enhanced the ornamental lake on the south side of the hall by adding an artificial river leading to it and encircling it with a walkway. In all, he laid out of additional ornamental features, including temples, grottoes and follies designed primarily by London architect James Paine. Although the grounds and buildings were not subsequently well maintained, the garden retains Pain's basic structure and is an unusual example of authentic 18th century landscape design. Durham County Council had already begun to acquire parts of the grounds when in 1997 it determined to undertake the preservation of the whole park. A study commissioned in 1999 provided a detailed estimate of the expenses of restoration and also indicated the property's significance, leading the Register of Parks and Gardens to give it a II* rating. With assistance from the Heritage Lottery Fund, the County purchased more of the grounds in 2001 and launched a restoration scheme to bring it all back to its former condition. The park now includes a visitor centre, cafe, toilets, exhibition, classroom and office. Hardwick Hall was also the site of a one-day music event, Hardwick Live, until 2015. Hardwick Live was replaced by a larger two-day event, Down To The Woods, in 2016.

Early history  Enzo Ferrari (1st from left), Tazio Nuvolari (4th) and Achille Varzi (6th) with Alfa Romeo Managing Director Prospero Gianferrari (3rd) at Colle Maddalena. Alfa Romeo Tipo C (or 8C35) entered by the Scuderia Ferrari in 1935-36 GP races Scuderia Ferrari was founded by Enzo Ferrari in 1929F1i.com: Ferrari  F1i.com, accessdate: 10. February 2019 to enter amateur drivers in various races, though Ferrari himself had raced in CMN (Costruzioni Maccaniche Nazionali) and Alfa Romeo cars before that date. The idea came about on the night of November 16 at a dinner in Bologna, where Ferrari solicited financial help from textile heirs Augusto and Alfredo Caniato and wealthy amateur racer Mario Tadini. He then gathered a team which at its peak included over forty drivers, most of whom raced in various Alfa Romeo 8C cars; Ferrari himself continued racing, with moderate success, until the birth of his first son Dino in 1932. The well-known prancing horse blazon first appeared at the 1932 Spa 24 Hours in Belgium on a two-car team of Alfa Romeo 8C 2300 Spiders, which finished first and second. In 1933 Alfa Romeo experienced economic difficulties, and withdrew its in-house team from racing. From then, the Scuderia Ferrari became the acting racing team of Alfa Romeo, when the factory released to the Scuderia the up-to-date Monoposto Tipo B racers. In 1935 Enzo Ferrari and Luigi Bazzi built the Alfa Romeo Bimotore, the first car to wear a Ferrari badge on the radiator cowl. Ferrari managed numerous established drivers (notably Tazio Nuvolari, Giuseppe Campari, Achille Varzi and Louis Chiron) and several talented rookies (such as Tadini, Guy Moll, Carlo Maria Pintacuda, and Antonio Brivio) from his headquarters in Viale Trento e Trieste, Modena, Italy, until 1938, at which point Alfa Romeo made him the manager of the factory racing division, Alfa Corse. Alfa Romeo had bought the shares of the Scuderia Ferrari in 1937 and transferred, from January 1, 1938, the official racing activity to Alfa Corse whose new buildings were being erected next to the Alfa factory at Portello (Milan). The Viale Trento e Trieste facilities then remained active for assistance to the racing customers. In October 1939 Enzo Ferrari left Alfa when the racing activity stopped, and founded his own company Auto Avio Costruzioni Ferrari, which also manufactured machine tools. The deal with Alfa included the condition that he would not use the Ferrari name on cars for four years. After that term expired, the road car company was called Ferrari S.p.A., while the name SEFAC Scuderia Enzo Ferrari Automobili Corsa was used for the racing department. Ferrari began working on a racecar of his own, the Tipo 815 (eight cylinders, 1.5 L displacement), in the 1939-1940 winter. The 815s, designed by Alberto Massimino, were thus the first true Ferrari cars, but after Alberto Ascari and the Marchese Lotario Rangoni Machiavelli di Modena drove them in the 1940 Mille Miglia, World War II put a temporary end to racing and the 815s saw no more competition. Ferrari continued to manufacture machine tools (specifically oleodynamic grinding machines); in 1943 he moved his headquarters to Maranello, where in 1944 it was bombed. Rules for a Grand Prix World Championship had been laid out before the war but it took several years afterward for the series to get going; meanwhile Ferrari rebuilt his works in Maranello and constructed the 12-cylinder, 1.5 L Tipo 125, which competed at several non-championship Grands Prix. The car made its debut in the 1948 Italian Grand Prix with Raymond Sommer, and achieved its first win at the minor Circuito di Garda with Giuseppe Farina. Formula One Ferrari is the most successful team in the history of Formula One racing, contesting every World Championship season since , winning 15 Drivers' Championships and 16 Constructors' Championships. Sports cars From the late 1940s to the early 1970s, Ferrari competed in sports car racing with great success, winning the World Sportscar Championship 13 times. Ferrari cars (including non-works entries) won the Mille Miglia 8 times, the Targa Florio 7 times and the 24 Hours of Le Mans 9 times. Ferrari scored early successes in sportcars, taking wins in the 1950 and 1951 Mille Miglia, although the 1951 victory resulted in a lengthy litigation when Ascari crashed through a barrier and killed a local doctor. The 1953 launch of the World Sportscar Championship appealed to Enzo Ferrari, and the company launched a dizzying array of sports racers over the next three years. This included the traditional compact V12-powered 166 MM and 250 MM, the larger V12 Ferrari 290, 340, and 375 MM and 315, 335, and 410 S, the four-cylinder 500, 625, 750, and 860 Monzas, and the six-cylinder Ferrari 376 S and 735 LM. With this potent lineup, Ferrari was able to claim six of the first seven WSC titles: 1953, 1954, 1956, 1957, and 1958. Throughout the 1960s, Ferrari were a dominant force in sportscar racing, winning the 24 Hours of Le Mans 6 years in a row from 1960 to 1965. The 1970s were the last decade Ferrari entered as a works effort in sports car racing. After an uninspired performance in the 1973 F1 World Championship, Enzo Ferrari stopped all development of sports cars in prototype and GT racing at the end of the year, in order to concentrate on Formula One.

She may have returned to the building at some point that night or the next morning. Due to the proximity of the World Trade Center and her medical training, her family believes she perished trying to help victims of the following day's terrorist attacks. Two investigations were conducted. The first by Ron Lieberman, her husband, and private investigator Ken Gallant, a former FBI agent, initially presumed her disappearance and possible death were unrelated to the attacks but later concluded it was the most likely outcome. A later investigation by New York City police delved into her life leading up to September 11 and found details of a double life, a history of marital problems, possible affairs with other women, job difficulties and alcohol and drug abuse by Philip, as well as a pending criminal charge against her, in the months before her disappearance. This led them to conclude it was just as likely that she had met a different fate. Lieberman and Philip's family have strongly disputed some of the facts and many of the conclusions of the police report, insinuating that the police did poor work or even fabricated some of their evidence. Her family have pointed out that there are many other 9/11 victims whose remains were never found, and other victims who were added to the list despite equally tenuous connections to the attack. No physical evidence has been found to suggest that she was killed in the attacks. Citing the evidence from the police report, a Surrogate's Court judge had denied her family's petition to have her declared a victim of the attacks, suggesting it was equally possible she may have intentionally disappeared or been murdered by someone she met on her frequent nights out. However, on January 31, 2008, a New York State appeals court overturned a lower-court ruling and declared that she had been a victim of the attacks, officially making her the 2,751st victim of the Twin Towers' collapse.  Early life  Sneha Anne Philip was born in the Indian state of Kerala. Philip later moved with her parents to upstate New York, settling first in the Albany area and then in Hopewell Junction, New York, a small hamlet in Dutchess County. Following her graduation from Johns Hopkins University, she decided to pursue a career in medicine and enrolled in the Chicago School of Medicine in 1995. There she met Ron Lieberman, a student a year behind her from Los Angeles, and began dating him. The two shared creative interests outside of their intended career—he was a musician and she was interested in painting. She took a year off traveling around Italy so the two could graduate together. They moved to New York City where they had both gained internships. Lieberman was at Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx, while she did hers at Cabrini Medical Center, closer to their small apartment in the East Village. The couple were married in May 2000 at a small ceremony held in Dutchess County, combining Jewish and South Indian Christian elements. Lieberman gave his bride a minnu, a traditional Malayali Christian wedding pendant shaped like a gold teardrop with a diamond set in it. They moved to a larger apartment in Battery Park City shortly afterwards.  Disappearance  Philip was last seen on September 10, 2001. On the day she disappeared, Philip was off from work. According to Lieberman, she was planning to spend the day cleaning up the apartment in anticipation of a dinner visit by her cousin two nights later. She had a two-hour online chat with her mother, during which she mentioned that she was planning to visit the Windows on the World restaurant on top of the nearby North Tower of the World Trade Center, where a friend was to be married the next spring. At 4 p.m. she signed off and went to drop off some clothes at a neighborhood dry cleaners, then went to a Century 21 where she used the couple's American Express card to buy lingerie, a dress, pantyhose and bed linens. Afterwards she bought three pairs of shoes at an annex to the store. A security camera at Century 21 recorded her during this shopping trip. The taped image and the credit-card records are the last confirmed records of Philip's presence anywhere. Ron Lieberman returned to the couple's apartment after midnight that night and noticed Philip was not there. He believed she had stayed out late or all night, as she had been doing, and resolved to remind her the next time he saw her to call him under those circumstances. He went to bed as he had to get up early the next morning for work. Later investigation found that someone had called Lieberman's cell phone from the apartment at 4 a.m. Lieberman does not remember it, but thinks he may have awoken briefly to check his voicemail. When he got up for work at 6:30, his wife had still not returned. That evening, after the terrorist attacks, he was able to use his medical credentials to get through the security perimeter and return to their apartment. Since the window had been left open, dust from the towers had accumulated throughout. There were tracks in it from the couple's two kittens, but none from any human. She was one of hundreds of people reported to police as missing that day. Like those of other victims, her family posted flyers all over the city in an effort to find her. Her case was the only one not connected to the attacks, and, in order to generate media interest, her brother claimed to the media that he had last heard from her during the attack. She has never been found or otherwise accounted for.  Investigations = By Lieberman and Gallant = Lieberman called American Express and learned about the credit-card purchases on the previous evening. He posted flyers in other Century 21 stores, and later that week a clerk from the Lower Manhattan store who had been relocated to Brooklyn called to say she remembered Philip, who had come in frequently. On the evening of September 10, the clerk recalled that Philip had been accompanied by another young woman, possibly Indian. After reviewing videotape footage for three weeks, Lieberman found the recording of his wife browsing in the coat department, but without anyone else. Since police detectives initially seemed to be unhelpful to Lieberman and assumed that Philip had died with the other victims, he hired private investigator Ken Gallant, who found two pieces of evidence suggesting that she may have returned to the apartment building early on the morning of September 11. The first was the call from the home phone to Lieberman's cell; the second was some videotape from the security cameras in the lobby. Timestamped at 8:43 a.m., just 3 minutes before American Airlines Flight 11 was crashed into the North Tower, and within the 7-9 a.m. timeframe during which, Lieberman later testified, Philip always returned after her nights out, it shows a woman entering the building, waiting near the elevator and leaving after a few minutes. Due to the poor contrast from the sunlight in the lobby, she was visible only in silhouette, but her hair and dress are consistent with Philip as seen in the Century 21 tape from the previous evening. Her family also says the woman exhibits similar mannerisms. She is, however, not carrying any of the bags that she would have had from her shopping trip, and again she is apparently unaccompanied. Lieberman could not positively identify her as his wife, but a city police investigator believes it was her.Saxe, D. (January 31, 2008). \\"In the Matter of a Judicial Declaration of Death of Sneha Anne Philip. Ronald Lieberman, Appellant.\\" . 2008 NY Slip Op 00630. New York State Unified Court System Gallant at first considered the possibility that Philip had used the attack to flee her mounting personal problems and start a new life under a new identity. But her computer's hard drive revealed no evidence of any such plans or contacts, and she had also left her glasses, passport, driver's license and credit cards, except the American Express card, behind. Lieberman kept the account open in case any leads developed from attempts to use it, but none ever did. Gallant and Lieberman eventually concluded that Philip witnessed the attack and, as a physician, rushed to the site to render aid and subsequently perished there, either within the towers or in the ensuing collapse. = By New York City police = The police department was not able to begin investigating the Philip case for some time after the attacks. When it did, it found many details about Philip's life prior to September 11 that suggested she may have been elsewhere, or already dead, when the towers fell. Earlier in the year, Cabrini had declined to renew Philip's contract, citing repeated tardiness and alcohol-related issues, effectively firing her. Shortly after she had been informed of that decision, she went out to a bar with other Cabrini employees. The outing led to her spending the night in jail. She complained to police that a fellow intern groped her during that time. The prosecutor who investigated the case dropped the sexual abuse charge and instead charged Philip with third-degree falsely reporting an incident, a misdemeanor under New York law. He offered to drop the charge if she recanted the original complaint, but she refused and was held overnight pending release. After her dismissal from Cabrini, she began spending nights out at gay and lesbian bars in the city, some known for their rough clientele. According to police, she would sometimes leave with women she met at these bars. Police also claim her brother discovered her and his then-girlfriend having sex, which her brother disputed. She got another internship, in internal medicine, at St. Vincent's Medical Center on Staten Island, but was running into similar problems there—she had already been suspended for missing a meeting with a substance abuse counselor. On the morning of September 10, she had been formally arraigned on the criminal charge and pleaded not guilty. The police report says she and Lieberman fought loudly at the courthouse afterwards about her problems and nights out, which ended with her walking away and leaving him to go home alone and get ready for work. After reviewing it, the city medical examiner removed Philip from the official list of victims in January 2004, one of the last three. = Family response to police report = Philip's husband, brother and family dispute much of what the police say and their interpretations of the documentary evidence. She was fired from Cabrini not because of alcoholism but because she had been a \\"whistleblower\\" who complained about racial and sexual bias (the hospital later told a reporter it had no evidence of any formal complaints by her). Lieberman says that while his wife frequented lesbian bars, it was because she did not want a repeat of the situation that had happened with her coworker. She never had sex with the women she went home with, he claims, and they would often merely listen to music, sleep or paint. One time, in fact, she came home covered with paint after going home with an artist. Her drinking was a temporary phase to ease her through the depression she was experiencing after being fired by Cabrini, and would stop once her life got back to normal, as he believed it was doing. Her brother says the report of him catching her with his girlfriend is completely fabricated and that he never even spoke with the detective who wrote it. Similarly, Lieberman says the couple never fought at the courthouse after her arraignment. The police, they believe, were extrapolating from what little they could find in an effort to make up for their early inattention to the case.  Court proceedings = Surrogate's Court = In 2003, after the police investigation concluded, Lieberman filed a court petition in New York County Surrogate's Court, which handles probate matters, to have his wife declared a victim of the attacks regardless of what the police had said. New York state law requires \\"clear and convincing\\" evidence of a possible victim's exposureNew York State Estate, Powers and Trusts Law, Section 2.-1.7 (a) to any lethal peril in order for any presumption of death and subsequent legal provisions, including benefits from the federal September 11th Victim Compensation Fund, to apply. He believed that his wife's profession would have led her to rush to the nearby World Trade Center, if she was in the vicinity, and offer aid to victims. Her mother further testified to their online chat, in which she said she was going to check out Windows on the World and possibly do some shopping at the Trade Center's mall. The author of the police report testified that he believed Philip probably died in the attacks. Ellen Winner, appointed guardian ad litem for Philip, introduced the police report and argued that there was no clear evidence she was at or near the Trade Center during the attacks. On June 29, 2006, Judge Renee Roth ruled that it could not be established that Philip died on September 11, 2001 and instead set the date of her legal death at September 10, 2004, three years after she was reported missing, per state law. The family appealed, contrasting her case with that of Juan Lafuente, another possible victim whose petition the court's counterpart in Dutchess County, where he lived, had accepted. Like Philip, his exposure to the attacks is based on circumstantial evidence. He, too, had recently lost a job and struggled with depression, and as a volunteer fire marshal in Poughkeepsie might himself have had a reason to offer assistance at the attack site. His office was eight blocks north of the W.T.C. complex, but the court accepted testimony from someone who frequented the same local deli claiming he had overheard Lafuente say he had a meeting at the Trade Center that morning. Philip's family believes Lafuente's petition, with similarly minimal evidence of the alleged decedent's presence at the site of the attacks, was accepted primarily because his wife, Colette, was mayor of Poughkeepsie at the time and the case was heard there rather than in Manhattan. = Appeals court = Philip's name is located on Panel S-66 of the National September 11 Memorial’s South Pool. Despite it being suggested that the chances of success were low, Lieberman and the family's lawyer went ahead with an appeal. On January 31, 2008, a five-judge panel reversed Judge Roth's decision, finding the simplest explanation to be the most likely – that Philip died trying to help people at Ground Zero. \\"This is a disturbing case,\\" wrote Judge David Saxe for the other three majority judges. Its central problem was the lack of direct evidence putting Philip at the site of the attack, he agreed. However, he said the \\"clear and convincing\\" standard He dismissed the claims made in the police report, saying they were hearsay and had not been properly introduced in the original hearing, instead appended by Winner to a post-hearing report. Nor did she properly follow up on assertions made in the report during the actual hearing. Thus, \\"any reliance by the court on purported facts asserted in those reports but unproved at hearing was improper.\\" If Juan Lafuente had been found to have faced exposure to the attacks, then Philip could be too, he concluded. He considered it unlikely that she had deliberately disappeared due to the lack of evidence of preparations, and agreed with Lieberman, Gallant and Stark that had she died some other way, some evidence would have turned up in the years since the attack. The dissenting judge, Bernard Malone Jr., said: He contrasted her case to Lafuente's by noting that he had had a more predictable daily routine, a more stable life, and that there was independent evidence confirming the meeting at the World Trade Center he might have been on his way to. \\"The degree of speculation is greater here\\", he said. Philip was thus officially declared the 2,751st victim of the Twin Towers' collapse. The decision leaves only one missing person whose possible death at the World Trade Center is unresolved. Fernando Molinar, a Mexican immigrant, has not been seen or heard from since September 8, 2001, when he told his mother on the telephone that he was starting a new job at a pizzeria near the building. A similar petition to Surrogate's Court on his behalf also was rejected.  Aftermath  Since the victims' fund made all its payments and closed in 2003, Lieberman will not receive any money. The decision does mean that Philip's name can be added to official memorials to the victims. One to her specifically has already been established at Dutchess Community College, where her mother works as a computer programmer. The family buried an urn full of ashes from Ground Zero at a cemetery near their home. Six months after the appeals court decision, in July 2008, the family was officially notified by the city that Philip had been added to the victims' list. No physical remains have been found for over a thousand victims of the attacks at the Trade Center, but the family still hopes that they might find yet some remnant of Philip. Her minnu, which they believe she was wearing at the time of the attacks, could have survived in the freshly collapsed buildings. They have sent pictures of it to the city property clerk's office in the event it can be matched to several hundred other unmatched personal items recovered from the ruins. At the National September 11 Memorial, Sneha Anne Philip is memorialized at the South Pool, on Panel S-66.

Post-World War I service In 1924 Hotson married Mildred Alice, daughter of Arthur Bennett Steward (a fellow member of the ICS); this coincides with his elevation to the position of Chief Secretary to the Government of Bombay. This was a period of rising instability in India, that would lead eventually to its independence from the British crown in 1947. Mahatma Gandhi's theory of non-violent resistance to British rule, Satyagraha, was not always followed, especially within the Presidency (State) of Maharashtra that surrounded Bombay. After the arrest of the national leaders Khurshed Nariman and Jamnalal Bajaj on 8 May 1930, mass demonstrations in the district of Sholapur led the Collector, Mr Knight, to seek advice from Hotson who was now in Bombay as the Home Member. The visit resulted in the imposition of martial law on 12 May.Maharashtra State Gazetteer: Sholapur District 2nd (rev.) ed. (Bombay: Government of Maharashtra, 1977), p. 101 ('History'). Martial law was lifted on 30 June, however, a year later, on 22 July 1931, as Acting Governor of Bombay in the period after the departure of Sir Frederick Sykes, Hotson was visiting the library of Fergusson College in Pune (Poona) when one of the students, Vasudeo Balwant Gogte (Gogate), attempted to assassinate him.Bulletin of International News (Royal Institute of International Affairs), vol. 8 (1931-1932), p. 86.Y.D. Phadke, Senapati Bapat: Portrait of a Revolutionary (Bombay: Semapati Bapat Centenary Celebration Samiti, 1981), p. 48. The bullet was stopped by a metal stud on Hotson's clothes, and he escaped unharmed. When asked why he had shot at the Home Member, Gogte is reported to have said \\"As a protest against your tyrannical administration\\". Remarkably, Hotson did not merely agree to Gogate's early release from Jail, he sent him a cheque for Rs. 100 as a token of goodwill and the hope that it would enable the young man to establish himself in a profession. As well as a naturalist, Hotson was also a keen philatelist, serving as President of the Philatelic Society of India, and editor of the Philatelic Journal of India, 1923–28.British Philatelic Trust, Rowland Hill, promotion of \\"the study, research and dissemination of knowledge\\" about philately - UK Philately, Stamps and stamp collecting plus much, much more GB Notes 1877 births 1944 deaths Alumni of Magdalen College, Oxford Governors of Bombay Indian Civil Service (British India) officers Knights Commander of the Order of the Star of India Officers of the Order of the British Empire British Indian Army officers Indian Army personnel of World War I Shooting survivors People from Glasgow People educated at Edinburgh Academy British philatelists ","title":"John Ernest Buttery Hotson"},{"id":"21243989","text":"William Gill may refer to: * William Gill (sea captain) (1795–1858), Manx master mariner * William Gill (explorer) (1843–1882), British explorer and intelligence gatherer, companion of William Mesny * William Gill (photographer) (1854–1912), British photographer * Will Gill (born 1968), Canadian artist * William Gill (boxer) (fl. 2007–2009), American boxer * William B.

Pahrump lies near the Nevada-California border and the area had a 2018 population of 36,174. History Pahrump was originally inhabited by the Southern Paiute. It was slowly inhabited by settlers in the late 19th century. They reportedly chose the name for Pahrump after the original Southern Paiute name Pah-Rimpi, or \\"Water Rock,\\" so named because of the abundant artesian wells in the valley. Because of the artesian wells, the new inhabitants of Pahrump Valley began a number of large ranch- style holdings, mostly over in size. On the ranches, alfalfa and cotton were grown, and livestock were raised. View of the mountains from town Until the 1960s, Pahrump had no telephone service except a radio transmitter phone in a phone booth next to the small market, and there were no paved roads in or out of the Pahrump Valley. However, as Las Vegas grew, real estate speculation became somewhat more popular in the area. This led to the introduction of telephone service and the construction of a paved highway between Las Vegas and Pahrump during the late 1960s. Later, this road (NV 160) was extended from Pahrump northward to US 95, near Amargosa Valley. A second paved road (NV 372) was introduced that went from Pahrump to neighboring Shoshone, California, which provided a link to the Death Valley area, as well as a shorter route to those wishing to travel to Los Angeles or other areas in California. In the fifties and sixties, there was a two-room elementary school and the high school students went to Shoshone. In 1974, Pahrump's first high school, Pahrump Valley High School, was constructed. Since the late 1970s, Pahrump has had steady growth, increasing from about 2,000 residents in 1980 to 22,000 in 2017. Pahrump is an archetypal example of an exurb. Almost all significant agriculture has ended in the valley, and the surface aquifers have been drained over the years. A wealthy Las Vegas casino owner, Ted Binion, buried a large treasure of silver in a secret underground vault in Pahrump. In 1998, Binion died under suspicious circumstances, and one of the parties accused of murdering Binion was apprehended while digging up the vault in Pahrump. A book about the Binion murder trial (and Las Vegas poker) is Positively Fifth Street by James McManus. On November 15, 2006, the Pahrump town board voted for an ordinance declaring English the official language of business, forbidding the display of foreign flags, and denying any benefits to illegal immigrants. A measure in the ordinance requires an American flag to be displayed above any other flag, regardless of what organization, nation, or government it represents.

Geography and climate Pahrump, Nevada, welcome sign According to the United States Census Bureau, the census-designated place of Pahrump has a total area of , all of which is land. By area, it is the largest CDP in the contiguous United States, although it ranks only eleventh nationally, since the largest ten are all in Alaska. The area lies in the Mojave Desert. 160 and 372 at the bright center Summers in Pahrump are generally hot and dry, with occasional pushes of monsoonal moisture beginning in early July. Being at a similar elevation to Las Vegas, daytime highs in summer average within a few degrees of Las Vegas. Record highs are similar between the two cities as well. A typical day during June through August brings temperatures around , and occasionally . Nighttime temperatures, however, are noticeably cooler. This is due to the lack of an urban heat island in Pahrump, allowing for intense radiative cooling after sundown. As a result, summer nights are pleasantly warm, bottoming out in the mid-60s or 70s °F (around 20 °C). Pahrump's location in a valley leads to large diurnal temperature ranges, typically but occasionally . By late August and early September, the sweltering summer heat noticeably tempers down. September is the gateway to fall, which brings very pleasant weather. October highs are generally and nighttime temperatures in the 50s °F (low teens °C). Due to its elevation, Pahrump is protected from the searing summer temperatures experienced in the nearby Death Valley. Like other locations in the Mojave desert, winters are typically mild, with occasional pushes of cold air from the north. Daytime highs average from the mid-50s and 60s °F (10s °C), but low temperatures hover around freezing for most nights between December to February. Spring brings pleasantly warm temperatures and cool evenings. Like other locations in the Mojave desert, this is the windiest time of year. Snowfall is rare in Pahrump, but there is generally at least one snow day per year.

Government Government offices for Pahrump Like many communities in Nevada, Pahrump has an unincorporated town status, with a limited government that manages land-use planning, recreation, and fire, while leaving most services to Nye County. In May 2009, the town board set up an advisory board to study incorporating Pahrump as a town or city. but the town opposition was too great and any plans to incorporate Pahrump were dropped. In 2012 the citizens of Pahrump voted to disband the Town Board form of government due to the board's continued pushes for incorporation in favor of becoming an advisory board under the County Commissioners. It was finalized in 2014 when the incumbent elected members' terms expired. Per the Town of Pahrump website, the elected Pahrump Town Board was disbanded as of January 5, 2015.

A Realist painting by Gustave Courbet Realism, sometimes called naturalism, in the arts is generally the attempt to represent subject matter truthfully, without artificiality and avoiding speculative fiction and supernatural elements. Realism has been prevalent in the arts at many periods, and can be in large part a matter of technique and training, and the avoidance of stylization. In the visual arts, illusionistic realism is the accurate depiction of lifeforms, perspective, and the details of light and colour. But realist or naturalist works of art may, as well or instead of illusionist realism, be \\"realist\\" in their subject matter, and emphasize the mundane, ugly or sordid. This is typical of the 19th-century Realist movement that began in France in the 1850s, after the 1848 Revolution, and also social realism, regionalism, or kitchen sink realism. The Realist painters rejected Romanticism, which had come to dominate French literature and art, with roots in the late 18th century. There have been various movements invoking realism in the other arts, such as the opera style of verismo, literary realism, theatrical realism, and Italian neorealist cinema. Visual arts Realist or illusionistic detail of the convex mirror in the Arnolfini Portrait by Jan van Eyck, 1434 Realism is the precise, detailed and accurate representation in art of the visual appearance of scenes and objects. Realism in this sense is also called naturalism, mimesis or illusionism. Realistic art was created in many periods, and it is in large part a matter of technique and training, and the avoidance of stylization. It becomes especially marked in European painting in the Early Netherlandish painting of Robert Campin, Jan van Eyck and other artists in the 15th century. However such \\"realism\\" is often used to depict, for example, angels with wings, which were not things the artists had ever seen in real life. Equally, 19th-century Realism art movement painters such as Gustave Courbet are by no means especially noted for precise and careful depiction of visual appearances; in Courbet's time that was more often a characteristic of academic painting, which very often depicted with great skill and care scenes that were contrived and artificial, or imagined historical scenes. It is the choice and treatment of subject matter that defines Realism as a movement in painting, rather than the careful attention to visual appearances. Other terms such as naturalism, naturalistic and \\"veristic\\" do not escape the same ambiguity, though the distinction between \\"realistic\\" (usually related to visual appearance) and \\"realist\\" is often useful, as is the term \\"illusionistic\\" for the accurate rendering of visual appearances.Stremmel, Kerstin, Realism, pp. 6–9, 2004, Taschen, Finocchio, Ross. \\"Nineteenth-Century French Realism\\". In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000–. online (October 2004) =Illusionistic realism= Lord Leighton's Cimabue's Celebrated Madonna of 1853–55 is at the end of a long tradition of illusionism in painting, but is not Realist in the sense of Courbet's work of the same period. The development of increasingly accurate representation of the visual appearances of things has a long history in art. It includes elements such as the accurate depiction of the anatomy of humans and animals, of perspective and effects of distance, and of detailed effects of light and colour. The Art of the Upper Paleolithic in Europe achieved remarkably lifelike depictions of animals, and Ancient Egyptian art developed conventions involving both stylization and idealization that nevertheless allowed very effective depictions to be produced very widely and consistently. Ancient Greek art is commonly recognised as having made great progress in the representation of anatomy, and has remained an influential model ever since. No original works on panels or walls by the great Greek painters survive, but from literary accounts, and the surviving corpus of derivative works (mostly Graeco-Roman works in mosaic) it is clear that illusionism was highly valued in painting. Pliny the Elder's famous story of birds pecking at grapes painted by Zeuxis in the 5th century BC may well be a legend, but indicates the aspiration of Greek painting. As well as accuracy in shape, light and colour, Roman paintings show an unscientific but effective knowledge of representing distant objects smaller than closer ones, and representing regular geometric forms such as the roof and walls of a room with perspective. This progress in illusionistic effects in no way meant a rejection of idealism; statues of Greek gods and heroes attempt to represent with accuracy idealized and beautiful forms, though other works, such as heads of the famously ugly Socrates, were allowed to fall below these ideal standards of beauty. Roman portraiture, when not under too much Greek influence, shows a greater commitment to a truthful depiction of its subjects, called verism. Baptism of Christ, \\"Hand G\\" (Jan van Eyck?), Turin-Milan Hours. An advanced illusionistic work for c. 1425, with the dove of the Holy Ghost in the sky. The art of Late Antiquity famously rejected illusionism for expressive force, a change already well underway by the time Christianity began to affect the art of the elite. In the West classical standards of illusionism did not begin to be reached again until the Late medieval and Early Renaissance periods, and were helped, first in the Netherlands in the early 15th century, and around the 1470s in Italy, by the development of new techniques of oil painting which allowed very subtle and precise effects of light to be painted using very small brushes and several layers of paint and glaze. Scientific methods of representing perspective were developed in Italy in the early 15th century and gradually spread across Europe, and accuracy in anatomy rediscovered under the influence of classical art. As in classical times, idealism remained the norm. The accurate depiction of landscape in painting had also been developing in Early Netherlandish/Early Northern Renaissance and Italian Renaissance painting, and was then brought to a very high level in 17th-century Dutch Golden Age painting, with very subtle techniques for depicting a range of weather conditions and degrees of natural light. After being another development of Early Netherlandish painting, by 1600 European portraiture could give a very good likeness in both painting and sculpture, though the subjects were often idealized by smoothing features or giving them an artificial pose. Still life paintings, and still life elements in other works, played a considerable role in developing illusionistic painting, though in the Netherlandish tradition of flower painting they long lacked \\"realism\\", in that flowers from all seasons were typically used, either from the habit of assembling compositions from individual drawings, or as a deliberate convention; the large displays of bouquets in vases, though close to modern displays of cut flowers that they have influenced, were entirely atypical of 17th-century habits, where flowers were displayed one at a time. Intriguingly, having led the development of illusionic painting, still life was to be equally significant in its abandonment in Cubism. =Realism or naturalism as the depiction of ordinary, everyday subjects= Woodcutting, miniature from a set of Labours of the Months by Simon Bening, c. 1550 The depiction of ordinary, everyday subjects in art also has a long history, though it was often squeezed into the edges of compositions, or shown at a smaller scale. This was partly because art was expensive, and usually commissioned for specific religious, political or personal reasons, that allowed only a relatively small amount of space or effort to be devoted to such scenes. Drolleries in the margins of medieval illuminated manuscripts sometimes contain small scenes of everyday life, and the development of perspective created large background areas in many scenes set outdoors that could be made more interesting by including small figures going about their everyday lives. Medieval and Early Renaissance art by convention usually showed non-sacred figures in contemporary dress, so no adjustment was needed for this even in religious or historical scenes set in ancient times. Early Netherlandish painting brought the painting of portraits as low down the social scale as the prosperous merchants of Flanders, and in some of these, notably the Arnolfini Portrait by Jan van Eyck (1434), and more often in religious scenes such as the Merode Altarpiece, by Robert Campin and his workshop (circa 1427), include very detailed depictions of middle-class interiors full of lovingly depicted objects. However these objects are at least largely there because they carry layers of complex significance and symbolism that undercut any commitment to realism for its own sake. Cycles of the Labours of the Months in late medieval art, of which many examples survive from books of hours, concentrate on peasants labouring on different tasks through the seasons, often in a rich landscape background, and were significant both in developing landscape art and the depiction of everyday working-class people. Annibale Carracci, The Butcher's Shop, early 1580s In the 16th century there was a fashion for the depiction in large paintings of scenes of people working, especially in food markets and kitchens: in many the food is given as much prominence as the workers. Artists included Pieter Aertsen and his nephew Joachim Beuckelaer in the Netherlands, working in an essentially Mannerist style, and in Italy the young Annibale Carracci in the 1580s, using a very down to earth unpolished style, with Bartolomeo Passerotti somewhere between the two. Pieter Bruegel the Elder pioneered large panoramic scenes of peasant life. Such scenes acted as a prelude for the popularity of scenes of work in genre painting in the 17th century, which appeared all over Europe, with Dutch Golden Age painting sprouting several different subgenres of such scenes, the Bamboccianti (though mostly from the Low Countries) in Italy, and in Spain the genre of bodegones, and the introduction of unidealized peasants into history paintings by Jusepe de Ribera and Velázquez. The Le Nain brothers in France and many Flemish artists including Adriaen Brouwer and David Teniers the Elder and Younger painted peasants, but rarely townsfolk. In the 18th century small paintings of working people working remained popular, mostly drawing on the Dutch tradition, and especially featuring women. Much art depicting ordinary people, especially in the form of prints, was comic and moralistic, but the mere poverty of the subjects seems relatively rarely have been part of the moral message. From the mid-19th century onwards this changed, and the difficulties of life for the poor were emphasized. Despite this trend coinciding with large-scale migration from the countryside to cities in most of Europe, painters still tended to paint poor rural people, largely leaving illustrators such as Gustave Doré to show the horrors of city slums. Crowded city street scenes were popular with the Impressionists and related painters, especially ones showing Paris. Medieval manuscript illuminators were often asked to illustrate technology, but after the Renaissance such images continued in book illustration and prints, but with the exception of marine painting largely disappeared in fine art until the early Industrial Revolution, scenes from which were painted by a few painters such as Joseph Wright of Derby and Philip James de Loutherbourg. Such subjects probably failed to sell very well, and there is a noticeable absence of industry, other than a few railway scenes, in painting until the later 19th century, when works began to be commissioned, typically by industrialists or for institutions in industrial cities, often on a large scale, and sometimes given a quasi-heroic treatment. American realism, a movement of the early 20th century, is one of many modern movements to use realism in this sense.

In favor of depictions of 'real' life, the Realist painters used common laborers, and ordinary people in ordinary surroundings engaged in real activities as subjects for their works. Its chief exponents were Gustave Courbet, Jean-François Millet, Honoré Daumier, and Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot. According to Ross Finocchio, formerly of the Department of European Paintings at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Realists used unprettified detail depicting the existence of ordinary contemporary life, coinciding with the contemporaneous naturalist literature of Émile Zola, Honoré de Balzac, and Gustave Flaubert.

In particular the Peredvizhniki or Wanderers group in Russia who formed in the 1860s and organized exhibitions from 1871 included many realists such as Ilya Repin, Vasily Perov, and Ivan Shishkin, and had a great influence on Russian art. In Britain artists such as Hubert von Herkomer and Luke Fildes had great success with realist paintings dealing with social issues.

Despite the general idealism of classical art, this too had classical precedents, which came in useful when defending such treatments in the Renaissance and Baroque. Demetrius of Alopece was a 4th-century BCE sculptor whose work (all now lost) was said to prefer realism over ideal beauty, and during the Ancient Roman Republic even politicians preferred a truthful depiction in portraits, though the early emperors favoured Greek idealism. Goya's portraits of the Spanish royal family represent a sort of peak in the honest and downright unflattering portrayal of important persons. Eilif Peterssen, The Salmon Fisher, 1889 A recurring trend in Christian art was \\"realism\\" that emphasized the humanity of religious figures, above all Christ and his physical sufferings in his Passion. Following trends in devotional literature, this developed in the Late Middle Ages, where some painted wooden sculptures in particular strayed into the grotesque in portraying Christ covered in wounds and blood, with the intention of stimulating the viewer to meditate on the suffering that Christ had undergone on his behalf. These were especially found in Germany and Central Europe. After abating in the Renaissance, similar works re-appeared in the Baroque, especially in Spanish sculpture. Renaissance theorists opened a debate, which was to last several centuries, as to the correct balance between drawing art from the observation of nature and from idealized forms, typically those found in classical models, or the work of other artists generally. All admitted the importance of the natural, but many believed it should be idealized to various degrees to include only the beautiful. Leonardo da Vinci was one who championed the pure study of nature, and wished to depict the whole range of individual varieties of forms in the human figure and other things.Blunt, 30–32, and the whole short chapter on Leonardo Leon Battista Alberti was an early idealizer, stressing the typical,Blunt, 14–20 with others such as Michelangelo supporting selection of the most beautiful – he refused to make portraits for that reason.Blunt, 59–64 Henri Biva, c. 1905–06, Matin à Villeneuve (From Waters Edge), oil on canvas, 151.1 x 125.1 cm. In the 17th century the debate continued, in Italy usually centred on the contrast between the relative \\"classical-idealism\\" of the Carracci and the \\"naturalist\\" style of the Caravaggisti, or followers of Caravaggio, who painted religious scenes as though set in the back streets of contemporary Italian cities, and used \\"naturalist\\" as a self-description. Bellori, writing some decades after Caravaggio's early death, and no supporter of his style, refers to \\"Those who glory in the name of naturalists\\" (naturalisti).\\"Quelle che si gloriamo del nome de naturalisti\\", quoted in Raben, 134, note 31 In the 19th century \\"Naturalism\\" or the \\"Naturalist school\\" was somewhat artificially erected as a term representing a breakaway sub-movement of Realism, that attempted (not wholly successfully) to distinguish itself from its parent by its avoidance of politics and social issues, and liked to proclaim a quasi-scientific basis, playing on the sense of \\"naturalist\\" as a student of Natural history, as the biological sciences were then generally known. The originator of the term was the French art critic Jules-Antoine Castagnary, who in 1863 announced that: \\"The naturalist school declares that art is the expression of life under all phases and on all levels, and that its sole aim is to reproduce nature by carrying it to its maximum power and intensity: it is truth balanced with science\\".Needham Émile Zola adopted the term with a similar scientific emphasis for his aims in the novel. Much Naturalist painting covered a similar range of subject matter as that of Impressionism, but using tighter, more traditional brushwork styles, and in landscapes often with more gloomy weather. The term \\"continued to be used indiscriminately for various kinds of realism\\" for several decades, often as a catch-all term for art that was outside Impressionism and later movements of Modernism and also was not Academic art. The later periods of the French Barbizon School and the Düsseldorf school of painting, with its students from many countries, and in 20th-century American Regionalism are movements which are often also described as \\"Naturalist\\", although the term is rarely used of British painting. Some recent art historians have deepened the confusion by claiming either Courbet or the Impressionists for the label.

It may be regarded as the general attempt to depict subjects as they are considered to exist in third person objective reality, without embellishment or interpretation and \\"in accordance with secular, empirical rules.\\"in so far as such subjects are \\"explicable in terms of natural causation without resort to supernatural or divine intervention\\" Morris, 2003. p. 5 As such, the approach inherently implies a belief that such reality is ontologically independent of human kind's conceptual schemes, linguistic practices and beliefs, and thus can be known (or knowable) to the artist, who can in turn represent this 'reality' faithfully. As Ian Watt states, modern realism \\"begins from the position that truth can be discovered by the individual through the senses\\" and as such \\"it has its origins in Descartes and Locke, and received its first full formulation by Thomas Reid in the middle of the eighteenth century.\\"Watt, 1957, p. 12 While the preceding Romantic era was also a reaction against the values of the Industrial Revolution, realism was in its turn a reaction to Romanticism, and for this reason it is also commonly derogatorily referred as \\"traditional\\" \\"bourgeois realism\\". Some writers of Victorian literature produced works of realism. The rigidities, conventions, and other limitations of \\"bourgeois realism\\" prompted in their turn the revolt later labeled as modernism; starting around 1900, the driving motive of modernist literature was the criticism of the 19th-century bourgeois social order and world view, which was countered with an antirationalist, antirealist and antibourgeois program.John Barth (1979) The Literature of Replenishment, later republished in The Friday Book (1984).Gerald Graff (1975) Babbitt at the Abyss: The Social Context of Postmodern.

Theatre Theatrical realism is said to have first emerged in European drama in the 19th century as an offshoot of the Industrial Revolution and the age of science. Some also specifically cited the invention of photography as the basis of the realist theater while others view that the association between realism and drama is far older as demonstrated by the principles of dramatic forms such as the presentation of the physical world that closely matches reality. The achievement of realism in the theatre was to direct attention to the social and psychological problems of ordinary life. In its dramas, people emerge as victims of forces larger than themselves, as individuals confronted with a rapidly accelerating world.Simard, Rodney. Postmodern Drama: Contemporary Playwrights in America and Britain. New York: UP of America, 1984. These pioneering playwrights were unafraid to present their characters as ordinary, impotent, and unable to arrive at answers to their predicaments. This type of art represents what we see with our human eyes. Anton Chekov, for instance, used camera works to reproduce an uninflected slice of life, exposing the rhetorical and suasive character of realistic theatricality. Scholars such as Thomas Postlewait noted that throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, there were numerous joinings of melodramatic and realistic forms and functions, which could be demonstrated in the way melodramatic elements existed in realistic forms and vice versa. In the United States, realism in drama preceded fictional realism by about two decades as theater historians identified the first impetus toward realism during the late 1870s and early 1880s. Its development is also attributed to William Dean Howells and Henry James who served as the spokesmen for realism as well as articulator of its aesthetic principles. The realistic approach to theater collapsed into nihilism and the absurd after World War II. Cinema Italian Neorealism was a cinematic movement incorporating elements of realism that developed in post-WWII Italy. Notable Neorealists included Vittorio De Sica, Luchino Visconti, and Roberto Rossellini. Realist films generally focus on social issues.Hayward, Susan. \\"Realism\\" in Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. pp. 334–35 There are two types of realism in film: seamless realism and aesthetic realism. Seamless realism tries to use narrative structures and film techniques to create a \\"reality effect\\" to maintain its authenticity.Hayward, Susan. \\"Realism\\" in Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. pp. 334–35 Aesthetic realism, which was first called for by French filmmakers in the 1930s and promoted by Andre Bazin in the 1950s, acknowledges that a \\"film cannot be fixed to mean what it shows\\", as there are multiple realisms; as such, these filmmakers use location shooting, natural light and non-professional actors to ensure the viewer can make up her/his own choice based on the film, rather than being manipulated into a \\"preferred reading\\".Hayward, Susan. \\"Realism\\" in Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. pp. 334–35 Siegfried Kracauer is also notable for arguing that realism is the most important function of cinema.Dudley Andrew, The Major Film Theories: An Introduction, Oxford, New York: Oxford University Press, 1976, Part II. Aesthetic realist filmmakers use long shots, deep focus and eye-level 90 degree shots to reduce manipulation of what the viewer sees.Hayward, Susan. \\"Realism\\" in Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. pp. 334–35 Italian neorealism filmmakers from after WWII took the existing realist film approaches from France and Italy that emerged in the 1960s and used them to create a politically-oriented cinema. French filmmakers made some politically-oriented realist films in the 1960s, such as the cinéma vérité and documentary films of Jean Rouch.Hayward, Susan. \\"Realism\\" in Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. pp. 334–35 In the 1950s and 1960s, British, French and German new waves of filmmaking produced \\"slice-of-life\\" films (e.g., kitchen sink dramas in the UK).Hayward, Susan. \\"Realism\\" in Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. pp. 334–35 Opera Verismo was a post-Romantic operatic tradition associated with Italian composers such as Pietro Mascagni, Ruggero Leoncavallo, Umberto Giordano, Francesco Cilea and Giacomo Puccini. They sought to bring the naturalism of influential late 19th-century writers such as Émile Zola, Gustave Flaubert, and Henrik Ibsen into opera. This new style presented true- to-life drama that featured gritty and flawed lower-class protagonists while some described it as a heightened portrayal of a realistic event. Although an account considered Giuseppe Verdi's Luisa Miller and La Traviata as the first stirrings of the verismo, some claimed that it began in 1890 with the first performance of Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana, peaked in the early 1900s.\\"Verismo\\" in Stanley Sadie (ed.) The New Grove Dictionary of Music & Musicians, London: Macmillan/New York: Grove, 1980, vol. 19 p. 670, It was followed by Leoncavallo's Pagliacci, which dealt with the themes of infidelity, revenge, and violence. Verismo also reached Britain where pioneers included the Victorian-era theatrical partnership of the dramatist W. S. Gilbert and the composer Arthur Sullivan (1842–1900). Specifically, their play Iolanthe is considered a realistic representation of the nobility although it included fantastical elements.

An odor is also called a \\"smell\\" or a \\"scent\\", which can refer to either a pleasant or an unpleasant odor. While \\"odor\\" can refer to pleasant and unpleasant odors, the terms \\"scent\\", \\"aroma\\", and \\"fragrance\\" are usually reserved for pleasant-smelling odors and are frequently used in the food and cosmetic industry to describe floral scents or to refer to perfumes. In the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth, English-speaking nations, \\"odour\\" refers to scents in general—without positive or negative connotations; but in the United States, and for many non-native English speakers around the world, \\"odor\\" generally has a negative connotation as a synonym for \\"stink\\". An unpleasant odor can also be described as \\"reeking\\" or called a \\"malodor\\", \\"stench\\", or \\"pong\\".  Physiology of smell  Odor control covers at a sewage treatment plant: Under these covers, grit and gravel are settled out of the wastewater. = Sense of smell = The perception of odors, or sense of smell, is mediated by the olfactory nerve. The olfactory receptor (OR) cells are neurons present in the olfactory epithelium, which is a small patch of tissue at the back of the nasal cavity. There are millions of olfactory receptor neurons that act as sensory signaling cells. Each neuron has cilia in direct contact with the air. Odorous molecules bind to receptor proteins extending from cilia and act as a chemical stimulus, initiating electric signals that travel along the olfactory nerve's axons to the brain. When an electrical signal reaches a threshold, the neuron fires, which sends a signal traveling along the axon to the olfactory bulb, a part of the limbic system of the brain. Interpretation of the smell begins there, relating the smell to past experiences and in relation to the substance(s) inhaled. The olfactory bulb acts as a relay station connecting the nose to the olfactory cortex in the brain. Olfactory information is further processed and forwarded to the central nervous system (CNS), which controls emotions and behavior as well as basic thought processes. Odor sensation usually depends on the concentration (number of molecules) available to the olfactory receptors. A single odorant is usually recognized by many receptors. Different odorants are recognized by combinations of receptors. The patterns of neuron signals help to identify the smell. The olfactory system does not interpret a single compound, but instead the whole odorous mix. This does not correspond to the concentration or intensity of any single constituent.Spengler, p. 492 Most odors consist of organic compounds, although some simple compounds not containing carbon, such as hydrogen sulfide and ammonia, are also odorants. The perception of an odor effect is a two-step process. First, there is the physiological part. This is the detection of stimuli by receptors in the nose. The stimuli are recognized by the region of the human brain which handles olfaction. Because of this, an objective and analytical measure of odor is impossible. While odor feelings are personal perceptions, individual reactions are usually related. They relate to things such as gender, age, state of health, and personal history. = Smell acuity by age and sex = The ability to identify odor varies among people and decreases with age. Studies show there are sex differences in odor discrimination, and women usually outperform men. Pregnant women have increased smell sensitivity, sometimes resulting in abnormal taste and smell perceptions, leading to food cravings or aversions. The ability to taste also decreases with age as the sense of smell tends to dominate the sense of taste. Chronic smell problems are reported in small numbers for those in their mid- twenties, with numbers increasing steadily, with overall sensitivity beginning to decline in the second decade of life, and then deteriorating appreciably as age increases, especially once over 70 years of age. = Smell acuity compared to other animals = For most untrained individuals, the act of smelling acquires little information concerning the specific ingredients of an odor. Their smell perception primarily offers information that elicits an emotional response. Experienced individuals, however, such as flavorists and perfumers, can identify discrete chemicals in complex mixtures using only the sense of smell. Odor perception is a primary evolutionary sense. The sense of smell can induce pleasure or subconsciously warn of danger, which may, for example, help to locate mates, find food, or detect predators. Humans have an unusually good sense of smell considering they have only 350 functional olfactory receptor genes compared to the 1,300 found in mice, for example. This is despite an apparent evolutionary decline in the sense of smell. The human sense of smell is comparable with many animals, able to distinguish between a diverse range of odors. Studies have reported that humans can distinguish in the region of one trillion unique aromas. = Habituation or adaptation = Odors that a person is used to, such as their own body odor, are less noticeable than uncommon odors. This is due to habituation. After continuous odor exposure, the sense of smell is fatigued, but recovers if the stimulus is removed for a time. Odors can change due to environmental conditions: for example, odors tend to be more distinguishable in cool dry air. Habituation affects the ability to distinguish odors after continuous exposure. The sensitivity and ability to discriminate odors diminishes with exposure, and the brain tends to ignore continuous stimulus and focus on differences and changes in a particular sensation. When odorants are mixed, a habitual odorant is blocked. This depends on the strength of the odorants in the mixture, which can change the perception and processing of an odor. This process helps classify similar odors as well as adjust sensitivity to differences in complex stimuli. = Genetic component = The primary gene sequences for thousands of olfactory receptors are known for the genomes of more than a dozen organisms. They are seven-helix-turn transmembrane proteins. But there are no known structures for any olfactory receptor. There is a conserved sequence in roughly three quarters of all ORs. This is a tripodal metal-ion binding site, and Suslick has proposed that the ORs are in fact metalloproteins (most likely with zinc, copper, and manganese ions) that serve as a Lewis Acid site for the binding of many odorant molecules. In 1978, Crabtree suggested that Cu(I) is \\"the most likely candidate for a metallo-receptor site in olfaction\\" of strong-smelling volatiles. These are also good metal-coordinating ligands, such as thiols. In 2012, Zhuang, Matsunami, and Block confirmed the Crabtree/Suslick proposal for the specific case of a mouse OR, MOR244-3, showing that copper is essential for detection of certain thiols and other sulfur-containing compounds. Thus, by using a chemical that binds to copper in the mouse nose, so that copper wasn’t available to the receptors, the authors showed that the mice couldn't detect the thiols without the copper. However, these authors also found that MOR244-3 lacks the specific metal ion binding site suggested by Suslick, instead showing a different motif in the EC2 domain. = Evolutionary impact = Gordon Shepherd proposed that the retro-nasal route of olfaction (odorants introduced to the olfactory mucosa through the oral cavity often as food) was partially responsible for the development of human olfactory acuity. He suggested the evolutionary pressure of diversification of food sources and increased complexity of food preparation presented humans with a broader range of odorants, ultimately leading to a \\"richer repertoire of smells\\". Animals such as dogs show a greater sensitivity to odors than humans, especially in studies using short-chain compounds. Higher cognitive brain mechanisms and more olfactory brain regions enable humans to discriminate odors better than other mammals despite fewer olfactory receptor genes.  Measuring techniques = Olfaktometrie = In Germany, the concentrations of odorants have since the 1870s been defined by Olfaktometrie, which helps to analyze the human sense of smell according to odor substance concentration, intensity of odor, odor quality, and hedonic assessment. The most accurate smell sensing is when a smell is first encountered, before habituation begins to change perception of odor.  Concentration  Odor concentration is an odor's pervasiveness. To measure odor sensation, an odor is diluted to a detection or recognition threshold. The detection threshold is the concentration of an odor in air when 50% of a population can distinguish between the odorous sample and an odor-free reference sample. The recognition odor threshold is usually a factor of 2 to 5 times higher than the detection threshold. The measurement of odor concentration is the most widespread method to quantify odors. It is standardized in CEN EN 13725:2003.CEN EN 13725:2003, Air quality – Determination of odour concentration by dynamic olfactometry . sipe-rtd.info The method is based on dilution of an odor sample to the odor threshold. The numerical value of the odor concentration is equal to the dilution factor that is necessary to reach the odor threshold. Its unit is the European Odour Unit, OUE. Therefore, the odor concentration at the odor threshold is 1 OUE by definition.  Olfactometer  To establish the odor concentration, an olfactometer is used which employs a group of human panelists. A diluted odorous mixture and an odor-free gas—n-Butanol—as a reference are presented from sniffing ports to a group of panelists who are sensitive in their perception of odor. To collect an odor sample, the samples must be collected using specialized sample bags, which are made from an odor free material, e.g. Teflon. The most accepted technique for collecting odor samples is the lung technique, where the sample bag is placed in a sealed drum, where a vacuum is created outside the bag, which fills under expansion, and draws into itself the sample from the source. Critically, all components which touch the odor sample, must be odor free, which includes lines and fittings. In comparing the odor emitted from each port, the panelists are asked to report if they can detect a difference between the ports. The gas-diluting ratio is then decreased by a factor of 1.4 or two (i.e., the concentration is increased accordingly). The panelists are asked to repeat the test. This continues until the panelists respond with certainty and correctly twice in a row. These responses are used to calculate the concentration of the odor in terms of European odor units (OUE/m3), where 1 OUE/m3≡40 ppb/v n-butanol. Humans can discriminate between two odorants that differ in concentration by as little as 7%. A human's odor detection threshold is variable. Repeated exposure to an odorant leads to enhanced olfactory sensitivity and decreased detection thresholds for a number of different odorants. It was found in a study that humans who were unable to detect the odor of androstenone developed the ability to detect it after repeated exposure. There are a number of issues which have to be overcome with sampling, these include: # If the source is under vacuum # if the source is at a high temperature # If the source has high humidity Issues such as temperature and humidity are best overcome using either pre-dilution or dynamic dilution techniques.  Other analytical methods  Other analytic methods can be subdivided into the physical, the gas chromatographical, and the chemosensory method. When measuring odor, there is a difference between emission and immission measurements. Emission measurement can be taken by olfactometry using an olfactometer to dilute the odor sample. Olfactometry is rarely used for immission measurement because of low odor concentrations involved. The same measuring principles are used, but the judgment of the air-assay happens without diluting the samples. Odor measurement is essential for odor regulation and control. An odor emission often consists of a complex mixture of many odorous compounds. Analytical monitoring of individual chemical compounds present in such an odor is usually not practical. As a result, odor sensory methods, instead of instrumental methods, are normally used to measure such odor. Odor sensory methods are available to monitor odor both from source emissions and in the ambient air. These two contexts require different approaches for measuring odor. The collection of odor samples is more easily accomplished for a source emission than for odor in the ambient air. Field measurement with portable field olfactometers can seem more effective, but olfactometer use is not regulated in Europe, while it is popular in the U.S. and Canada, where several States set limits at the receptor sites or along the perimeter of odor-emitting plants, expressed in units of dilution-to-threshold (D/T).  Intensity  Odor intensity is the perceived strength of odor sensation. This intensity property is used to locate the source of odors and perhaps most directly related to odor nuisance. The perceived strength of the odor sensation is measured in conjunction with odor concentration. This can be modeled by the Weber-Fechner law: I = a × log(c) + b, where I is the perceived psychological intensity at the dilution step on the butanol scale, a is the Weber-Fechner coefficient, C is the chemical concentrations, and b is the intercept constant (0.5 by definition). Odor intensity can be expressed using an odor intensity scale, which is a verbal description of an odor sensation to which a numerical value is assigned. Odor intensity can be divided into the following categories according to intensity: :0 – no odor :1 – very weak (odor threshold) :2 – weak :3 – distinct :4 – strong :5 – very strong :6 – intolerable This method is applied by in the laboratory and is done so by a series of suitably trained panelists/observers who have been trained to appropriately define intensity.  Hedonic tone assessment  Hedonic assessment is the process of rating odors according to a scale ranging from extremely unpleasant to extremely pleasant. It is important to note that intensity and hedonic tone, whilst similar, refer to different things: that is, the strength of the odor (intensity) and the pleasantness of an odor (hedonic tone). Moreover, it is important to note that perception of an odor may change from pleasant to unpleasant with increasing concentration, intensity, time, frequency, and previous experience with a specific odor—all factors in determining a response.Spengler, p. 486 = FIDOL factors = The overall set of qualities are sometimes identified as the \\"FIDOL factors\\", (short for Frequency, Intensity, Duration, Offensiveness and Location). The character of an odor is a critical element in assessing an odor. This property is the ability to distinguish different odors and is only descriptive. First, a basic description is used—such as sweet, pungent, acrid, fragrant, warm, dry, or sour. The odor is then referenced to a source such as sewage or apple which can then be followed by a reference to a specific chemical such as acids or gasoline. Most commonly, a set of standard descriptors is used, which may range from \\"fragrant\\" to \\"sewer odor\\". Although the method is fairly simplistic, it is important for the FIDOL factors to be understood by the person rating the smell. This method is most commonly used to define the character of an odor which can then be compared to other odors. It is common for olfactometry laboratories to report character as an additional factor post sample-analysis.  Categorization  Different categorizations of primary odors have been proposed, including the following, which identifies seven primary odors:Spengler, p. 483 # Musky – perfumes/aftershave # Putrid – rotten eggs # Pungent – vinegar # Camphoraceous – mothballs # Ethereal – dry cleaning fluid # Floral – roses (see also floral scent) # Pepperminty – mint gum Although recent progress has been made, the idea of primary perceptions is disputed, and more so the concept of primary odors. = Interpretive dispersion modeling = In many countries odor modeling is used to determine the extent of an impact from an odor source. These are a function of modeled concentration, averaging time (over what time period the model steps are run over, typically hourly), and a percentile. Percentiles refer to a statistical representation of how many hours per year the concentration C may be exceeded based on the averaging period. = Sampling from area sources = There are two main odor sampling techniques: direct and indirect odor sampling techniques.  Direct sampling  Direct refers to the placement of an enclosure on or over an emitting surface from which samples are collected, and an odor emission rate is determined. The most commonly used direct methods include the flux chamber and wind tunnels which include the UNSW wind tunnel.UNSW wind tunnel dimensions. Odour.unsw.edu.au There are many other available techniques, and consideration should be given to a number of factors before selecting a suitable method. A source which has implications for this method are sources, such as bark bed biofilters, that have a vertical velocity component. For such sources, consideration must be given as to the most appropriate method. A commonly used technique is to measure the odor concentration at the emitting surface, and combine this with the volumetric flow rate of air entering the biofilter to produce an emission rate.  Indirect sampling  Indirect sampling is often referred to as back calculation. It involves the use of a mathematical formula to predict an emission rate. Many methods are used, but all make use of the same inputs which include surface roughness, upwind and downwind concentrations, stability class (or other similar factor), wind speed, and wind direction.  Health risks  The human sense of smell is a primary factor in the sensation of comfort. Olfaction as a sensory system brings awareness of the presence of airborne chemicals. Some inhaled chemicals are volatile compounds that act as a stimulus, triggering unwanted reactions such as nose, eye, and throat irritation. Perception of odor and of irritation is unique to each person, and varies because of physical conditions or memory of past exposures to similar chemicals. A person's specific threshold, before an odor becomes a nuisance, depends also on the frequency, concentration, and duration of an odor. The perception of irritation from odor sensation is hard to investigate because exposure to a volatile chemical elicits a different response based on sensory and physiological signals, and interpretation of these signals is influenced by experience, expectations, personality, or situational factors. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) may have higher concentrations in confined indoor environments, due to restricted infiltration of fresh air, as compared to the outdoor environment, leading to greater potential for toxic health exposures from a variety of chemical compounds. Health effects of odor are traced to the sensation of an odor or the odorant itself. Health effects and symptoms vary—including eye, nose, or throat irritation, cough, chest tightness, drowsiness, and mood change—all of which decrease as an odor ceases. Odors may also trigger illnesses such as asthma, depression, stress-induced illness, or hypersensitivity. The ability to perform tasks may decrease, and other social/behavioral changes may occur. Occupants should expect remediation from disturbing and unexpected odors that disturb concentration, diminish productivity, evoke symptoms, and generally increase the dislike for a particular environment. It is important to set occupational exposure limits (OELs) to ensure the health and safety of workers, as well as comfort, because exposure to chemicals can elicit physiological and biochemical changes in the upper respiratory system. Standards are hard to set when exposures are not reported and can also be hard to measure. Workforce populations vary in terms of discomfort from odors because of exposure history or habituation, and they may not realize possible risks of exposure to chemicals that produce specific odors. Types Some odors are sought after, such as from perfumes and flowers, some of which command high prices. Whole industries have developed around products to remove unpleasant odors (see deodorant). Odor molecules transmit messages to the limbic system, the area of the brain that governs emotional responses. Some believe that these messages have the power to alter moods, evoke distant memories, raise their spirits, and boost self-confidence. This belief has led to the concept of \\"aromatherapy\\" wherein fragrances are claimed to cure a wide range of psychological and physical problems. Aromatherapy claims that fragrances can positively affect sleep, stress, alertness, social interaction, and general feelings of well-being. However, the evidence for the effectiveness of aromatherapy consists mostly of anecdotes and lacks controlled scientific studies to back up its claims. With some fragrances, such as those found in perfume, scented shampoo, scented deodorant, or similar products, people can be allergic to the ingredients. The reaction, as with other chemical allergies, can be anywhere from a slight headache to anaphylactic shock, which can result in death. Unpleasant odors play various roles in nature, often to warn of danger, though this may not be known to the subject who smells it. An odor that is viewed as unpleasant by some people or cultures can be viewed as attractive by others where it is more familiar or has a better reputation. It is commonly thought that those exuding an unpleasant body odor will be unattractive to others. But studies have shown that a person who is exposed to a particular unpleasant odor can be attracted to others who have been exposed to the same unpleasant odor. This includes smells associated with pollution. What causes a substance to smell unpleasant may be different from what one perceives. For example, perspiration is often viewed as having an unpleasant odor, but it is odorless. It is the bacteria in the perspiration that cause the odor. Unpleasant odors can arise from specific industrial processes, adversely affecting workers and even residents downwind of the source. The most common sources of industrial odor arise from sewage treatment plants, refineries, animal rendering factories, and industries processing chemicals (such as sulfur) which have odorous characteristics. Sometimes industrial odor sources are the subject of community controversy and scientific analysis. Body odor is present both in animals and humans and its intensity can be influenced by many factors (behavioral patterns, survival strategies). Body odor has a strong genetic basis both in animals and humans, but it can be also strongly influenced by various diseases and psychological conditions. =Study= The study of odors is a growing field but is a complex and difficult one. The human olfactory system can detect many thousands of scents based on only minute airborne concentrations of a chemical. The sense of smell of many animals is even better. Some fragrant flowers give off odor plumes that move downwind and are detectable by bees more than a kilometer away. The study of odors is complicated by the complex chemistry taking place at the moment of a smell sensation. For example, iron-containing metallic objects are perceived to have a distinctive odor when touched, although iron's vapor pressure is negligible. According to a 2006 study, this smell is the result of aldehydes (for example, nonanal) and ketones: 1-octen-3-one) released from the human skin on contact with ferrous ions that are formed in the sweat-mediated corrosion of iron. The same chemicals are also associated with the smell of blood, as ferrous iron in blood on skin produces the same reaction. =Pheromones= Pheromones are odors that are used for communication, and are sometimes called \\"airborne hormones\\". A female moth may release a pheromone that can entice a male moth that is several kilometers downwind. Honeybee queens constantly release pheromones that regulate the activity of the hive. Worker bees can release such smells to call other bees into an appropriate cavity when a swarm moves into new quarters, or to \\"sound\\" an alarm when the hive is threatened. =Advanced technology= Most artificial or electronic nose instruments work by combining output from an array of non-specific chemical sensors to produce a fingerprint of whatever volatile chemicals in the local environment. Most electronic noses need to be \\"trained\\" to recognize chemicals of interest before it can be used. Many current electronic-nose instruments suffer from problems with reproducibility subject to varying ambient temperature and humidity. An example of this type of technology is the colorimetric sensor array, which visualizes odor through color change and creates a \\"picture\\" of it. Behavioral cues Odor perception is a complex process involving the central nervous system and can evoke psychological and physiological responses. Because the olfactory signal terminates in or near the amygdala, odors are strongly linked to memories and can evoke emotions. The amygdala participates in the hedonic or emotional processing of olfactory stimuli. Odors can disturb our concentration, diminish productivity, evoke symptoms, and in general increase a dislike for an environment. Odors can impact the liking for a person, place, food, or product as a form of conditioning. Memories recalled by odors are significantly more emotional and evocative than those recalled by the same cue presented visually or auditorily. Odors can become conditioned to experiential states and when later encountered have directional influences on behavior. Doing a frustrating task in a scented room decreases performance of other cognitive tasks in the presence of the same odor. Nonhuman animals communicate their emotional states through changes in body odor, and human body odors are indicative of emotional state. Human body odors influence interpersonal relationships and are involved in adaptive behaviors, such as parental attachment in infants or partner choice in adults. \\"Mothers can discriminate the odor of their own child, and infants recognize and prefer the body odor of their mother over that of another woman. This maternal odor appears to guide infants toward the breast and to have a calming effect.\\" Body odor is involved in the development of infant–mother attachment and is essential to a child’s social and emotional development and evokes feelings of security. Reassurance created by familiar parental body odors may contribute significantly to the attachment process. Human body odors can also affect mate choice. Fragrances are commonly used to raise sexual attractiveness and induce sexual arousal. Researchers found that people choose perfume that interacts well with their body odor. Body odor is a sensory cue critical for mate selection in humans because it is a signal of immunological health. Women prefer men with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genotypes and odor different from themselves especially during ovulation. Different MHC alleles are favorable because different allele combinations would maximize disease protection and minimize recessive mutations in offspring. Biologically females tend to select mates \\"who are most likely to secure offspring survival and thus increase the likelihood that her genetic contribution will be reproductively viable.\\" Studies have suggested that people might be using odor cues associated with the immune system to select mates. Using a brain-imaging technique, Swedish researchers have shown that gay and straight males' brains respond in different ways to two odors that may be involved in sexual arousal, and that the gay men respond in the same way as straight women, though it could not be determined whether this was cause or effect. The study was expanded to include lesbian women; the results were consistent with previous findings that lesbian women were not as responsive to male-identified odors, while their response to female cues was similar to that of straight males. According to the researchers, this research suggests a possible role for human pheromones in the biological basis of sexual orientation.Wade, Nicholas (May 9, 2005) \\"Gay Men are found to have Different Scent of Attraction\\". NY Times An odor can cue recall of a distant memory. Most memories that pertain to odor come from the first decade of life, compared to verbal and visual memories which usually come from the 10th to 30th years of life. Odor-evoked memories are more emotional, associated with stronger feelings of being brought back in time, and have been thought of less often as compared to memories evoked by other cues. =Use in design= The sense of smell is not overlooked as a way of marketing products. The deliberate and controlled application of scent is used by designers, scientists, artists, perfumers, architects, and chefs. Some applications of scents in environments are in casinos, hotels, private clubs, and new automobiles. For example, \\"technicians at New York City’s Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center disperse vanilla-scented oil into the air to help patients cope with the claustrophobic effects of MRI testing. Scents are used at the Chicago Board of Trade to lower the decibel level on the trading floor.\\" If ingredients are listed on a product, the term \\"fragrance\\" can be used in a general sense.  Scent preferences = Effect of perfume on sexual attractiveness = Both men and women use perfume to boost their sexual attractiveness to members of the opposite, or same, sex. When people find that a particular perfume or aftershave is perceived positively, they may be hard- pressed to change it. Olfactory communication is natural in humans. Without perfume or aftershave, humans unconsciously detect people's natural scents: in the form of pheromones. Pheromones are usually detected unconsciously, and it is believed that they have an important influence on human's social and sexual behaviour There are a number of hypotheses concerning why humans wear perfume or aftershave, and whether it amplifies or reduces their natural scents. In 2001, a study found that the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) (a polymorphic set of genes which is important for immune-function in humans) is correlated with the ingredients found in perfume. This suggests that humans do, in fact, choose perfumes that complement or enhance their natural scents (their pheromones). This evidence offers support for the hypothesis that perfume is chosen by individuals to advertise their physical health. Research suggests that this advertisement of good health will, in fact, enhance females’ attractiveness to the opposite sex as health markers have been shown to do. While strong evidence has been found to support the hypothesis that wearing perfume enhances females’ attractiveness to males, little research has been done into the effect of fragrance on males’ attractiveness to females. Considerably more research has covered the effect of males’ natural odor and females’ ratings of attractiveness. Many studies (e.g.) found that odor predicted attractiveness when female raters were not on any form of contraceptive pill. For those who were, there was no relation between attractiveness and body odor. A person's odor can increase or decrease ratings of attractiveness because the olfactory receptors in the brain are directly linked with the limbic system, the part of the brain that is thought to be most involved with emotion. This link is important, because if an individual associates positive affect (elicited by pheromones), with a potential mate, their liking for, and attraction to, that potential mate will be increased. Although not a typically evolutionary hypothesis, this hypothesis is one that acknowledges how humans have adapted their mating strategies to modern-day societal norms. = Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and body odor preferences = Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is a genotype found in vertebrates, including humans. MHC is thought to contribute to mate choice in animals and humans. In sexual selection, females opt for mates with an MHC which differs from their own, optimising genes for their offspring. The \\"heterozygote advantage\\" and \\"Red Queen\\" explanations for these findings fall under the \\"pathogen hypothesis\\". Due to differences in MHC alleles' resistance to pathogens, a preference for mates with a dissimilar MHC composition has been argued to act as a mechanism to avoid infectious diseases. According to the heterozygotes-advantage hypothesis, diversity within the MHC genotype is beneficial for the immune system due to a greater range of antigens available to the host. Therefore, the hypothesis proposes that MHC heterozygotes will be superior to MHC homozygotes in fighting off pathogens. Experimental research has shown mixed findings for this idea. The \\"Red Queen\\" or \\"rare-allele\\" hypothesis suggests that diversity in the MHC gene provides a moving target for pathogens, making it more difficult for them to adapt to MHC genotypes in the host. Another hypothesis suggests that preferences for MHC-dissimilar mates could serve to avoid inbreeding. Body odor can provide MHC information. Although less is known about how odor is influenced by MHC genes, possible explanations have been that microbial flora or volatile acids are affected by the gene, which can be detected in body odor. Female mice and humans have both shown odor preferences for males with MHC-dissimilarity. Research has shown that women prefer the scent of men with dissimilar MHC genes. In a study, women rated the scent of T-shirts, worn over two nights by men, as more pleasant when smelling those of MHC-dissimilar men. It has also been found that women were reminded more of current or prior partners when smelling odors from men whose MHC was dissimilar to their own. A study of married couples found that MHC haplotypes differed between spouses more than chance would dictate. Taking oral contraceptives has been found to reverse the MHC- dissimilarity odor preference. = Women's scent preferences and the menstrual cycle = Women’s preferences for body odor change with their menstrual cycles. The ovulatory-shift hypothesis argues that women experience elevated immediate sexual attraction, relative to low-fertile days of the cycle, to men with characteristics that reflect good genetic quality. Body odor may provide significant cues about a potential sexual partner's genetic quality, reproductive status, and health, with a woman's preferences for particular body odors becoming heightened during her most fertile days. As certain body odors can reflect good genetic quality, woman are more likely to prefer these scents when they are fertile, as this is when they are most likely to produce offspring with any potential mates, with conception-risk being related to a preference for the scent of male symmetry. Men also prefer the scent of women at their fertile cycle points. There are several scents that reflect good genetic quality that females prefer during the most fertile phase of their cycles. Women prefer the scent of symmetrical men more during the fertile phases of their menstrual cycle than during their infertile phases, with estrogen positively predicting women's preferences for the scent of symmetry. Women's preferences for masculine faces is greatest when their fertility is at its highest, and so is the preference for attractive faces. Other scents found to be preferred by women in the most fertile phase of their cycle are the scent for developmental stability, and the scent for dominance. If women are taking a contraceptive pill the changes in mate scent preferences over the menstrual cycle are not expressed. If odor plays a role in human mate choice then the contraceptive pill could disrupt disassortative mate preferences. Those taking a contraceptive pill show no significant preference for the scent of either symmetrical or asymmetrical men, whereas normally cycling women prefer the scent of shirts worn by symmetrical men. Males' preferences for women's scent may also change if the woman is taking oral contraceptives. When women take a contraceptive pill, this has been found to demolish the cycle attractiveness of odors that men find attractive in normally ovulating women. Therefore, a contraceptive pill affects both women's preferences for scent and also affects their own scents, making their scents less attractive to males than the scent of normally cycling women.

It is typically a secondary sex characteristic of human males. Men typically start developing facial hair in the later stages of puberty or adolescence, around fifteen years of age, and most do not finish developing a full adult beard until around eighteen or later. Large variations can occur however, as boys as young as eleven have been known to develop facial hair. Women are also capable of developing facial hair, especially after menopause, though typically significantly less than men. Men may style their facial hair into beards, moustaches, goatees or sideburns; many others completely shave their facial hair and this is referred to as being \\"clean-shaven\\". The term whiskers, when used to refer to human facial hair, indicates the hair on the chin and cheeks.  In male adolescence  Abraham Lincoln is said to have grown his beard on the recommendation of the eleven-year-old Grace Bedell. The moustache forms its own stage in the development of facial hair in adolescent males. Facial hair in males does not always appear in a specific order during puberty and varies among some individuals but may follow this process: * During puberty, the first facial hair to appear tends to grow at the corners of the upper lip (age 11–15). * It then spreads to form a moustache over the entire upper lip (age 16–17). * This is followed by the appearance of hair on the upper part of the cheeks and the area under the lower lip (age 16–18). * It eventually spreads to the sides and lower border of the chin and the rest of the lower face to form a full beard (age 17–21). * Although this order is commonly seen, it can vary widely, with some facial hair starting from the chin and up towards the sideburns. * As with most human biological processes, this specific order may vary among some individuals depending on one's genetic heritage or environment.  Military  Depending on the periods and countries, facial hair was prohibited in the army or, on the contrary, an integral part of the uniform.  In religions  Many religious male figures are recorded to have had facial hair; for example, numerous prophets mentioned in the Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity and Islam) were known to grow beards. Other religions, such as Sikhism, mandate growing beards. Amish men grow beards after marriage, but continue to shave their moustaches in order to avoid historical associations with military facial hair due to their pacifistic beliefs.  On women  Women typically have little hair on the face, apart from eyebrows and the vellus hair that covers most of the body. However, in some cases, women have noticeable facial hair growth, most commonly after menopause. Excessive hairiness (especially facially) is known as hirsutism and is usually an indication of atypical hormonal variation. Many women depilate facial hair that appears, as considerable social stigma is associated with facial hair on women, and freak shows and circuses have historically displayed bearded women. Many women globally choose to totally remove their facial hair by means of electrolysis (permanent) or laser hair removal (semi-permanent).  Styles of facial hair  In great apes  Great apes such as orangutan males seem to have facial hair as well. In chimpanzees and bonobos, facial and body hair become sparser in adulthood due to the aging process, which is in stark contrast to humans, whose facial and body hair become stronger. Because infant great apes have thicker \\"facial\\" (as well as body) hair than their older counterparts, it is not androgenic but part of the fur complex. The sensitivity to androgens seems to have been acquired by humans on the gene KRT37 relatively recently.

Early life McGinnis was born in Boston, Massachusetts. His mother died when he was an infant and he lived with his aunt for a time.Indiana's Prominent Civil War Personalities At age 11 he and his father moved to Ohio where his father became a hatter. It was during his time in Ohio that war with Mexico broke out and George volunteered his services. Commissioned as a lieutenant in the 2nd Ohio Volunteer Infantry, he was mustered out of the volunteers with the rank of captain in 1847; and returned to Ohio to take up hatting. Civil War=Western Virginia= Immediately after the Civil War began, McGinnis volunteered for service in the 11th Indiana Volunteer Infantry Regiment being raised by Col. Lew Wallace for 3 month service. Within a month he rose from private to captain and then, on April 25, lieutenant colonel. McGinnis and the 11th Indiana took part in Wallace's raid on Romney, West Virginia, on June 13, 1861. =Fort Donelson & Shiloh= The 3-month enlistment ran out, but the regiment was re-mustered, and on August 31, 1861, McGinnis was again made lieutenant colonel with Wallace as colonel. Due to the style of training, the regiment became known as \\"Wallace's Zouaves\\". On September 3, Wallace was promoted to brigadier general and McGinnis became colonel of the regiment.Eicher p.378 McGinnis led the regiment during the capture of Fort Henry and then overland toward Fort Donelson. During the Battle of Fort Donelson, his regiment was temporarily attached to Lew Wallace's division and fought in the counterattack on the Union right. He received the praise of Lew Wallace for his actions that battle. McGinnis also led his regiment in the following battles of Shiloh and Corinth. =Vicksburg= On April 4, 1863, McGinnis was promoted to brigadier general of volunteers, to rank from November 29, 1862.Brig. Gen. George F. McGinnis He was in command of a brigade in the District of Eastern Arkansas. After a time of garrison duty, McGinnis was appointed to command the 1st Brigade in Alvin P. Hovey's 12th Division of the XIII Corps, commanded by John A. McClernand. McGinnis's brigade was heavily engaged in the Battle of Champion Hill and fought with distinction. During the siege of Vicksburg, his troops occupied a length of siege lines in the center of the Union army near Fort Garrott. A bronze plaque of McGinnis is located near this spot. After the fall of Vicksburg, McGinnis fell upon a series of insignificant commands. This was possibly due to his connection with McClernand and Wallace, both of whom had become unpopular with Ulysses S. Grant and the regular army officers of the Army of the Tennessee. More significantly, McGinnis belonged to the XIII Corps, which was assigned to the Department of the Gulf. The Department of the Gulf had become relatively quiet after the fall of Vicksburg and Port Hudson. McGinnis rose to command of the 3rd Division and held that command during most of 1864. During the winter of 1864–1865 he was transferred to command the \\"Forces on the White River\\" in the Department of Arkansas. This was essentially a brigade-sized command guarding the mouth of the White River. Later life McGinnis was mustered out of the volunteer services on August 24, 1865. He moved to Indianapolis and ran a fiduciary business and served in various local political positions. From 1867 to 1871 he served as the Marion County auditor and then from 1900 was appointed postmaster of Indianapolis. He died on May 29, 1910, in Indianapolis, and is buried in that city's Crown Hill Cemetery.

In Classical antiquity and Christendom, prudence and fortitude were seen as the cardinal virtues that should govern society. Gentry is a largely historical term for the European social class of people who were \\"well-born, genteel and well-bred\\"... In its widest sense, it refers to people of good social position, from families of long descent, and connected to landed estates or the upper levels of the clergy (especially an established church). The gentry largely consisted of landowners who could live entirely from rental income, or at least had a country estate; some were gentleman farmers. The British social class of landed gentry was distinct from, and socially below, the country's peerage, although in fact some of them were wealthier than some peers, and many were close relatives. The gentry were typically armigerous (having a coat of arms), but, owing to the primogeniture rules of the peerage of England (and elsewhere in the United Kingdom), most gentry did not have titles of nobility. In contrast, in Continental Europe where nobility and titles were inherited by more than one member of a family, a greater proportion of the population held titles. This was the case with the French and Polish landed gentry. There were analogous traditional social elite strata based in cities. The adjective \\"patrician\\" (\\"of or like a person of high social rank\\") describes the governing elites in a medieval metropolis, such as those of the free cities of Italy (Venice and Genoa), and the free imperial cities of Germany, Switzerland, and the Hanseatic League. The term \\"gentry\\" by itself, so Peter Coss argues, is a construct that historians have applied loosely to rather different societies. Any particular model may not fit a specific society, yet a single definition nevertheless remains desirable.Cambridge University Press 0521021006 - The Origins of the English Gentry Peter Coss The word derives from the Old French genterie, from gentil, 'high-born, noble'.  Historical background of social stratification in the West This part of a 12th-century Swedish tapestry has been interpreted to show, from left to right, the one- eyed Odin, the hammer-wielding Thor and Freyr. This triad corresponds closely to the trifunctional division: Odin is the patron of priests and magicians, Thor of warriors, and Freyr of fertility and farming. The Indo-Europeans who settled Europe, Central and Western Asia and the Indian subcontinent conceived their societies to be ordered (not divided) in a tripartite fashion, the three parts being castes.Mallory, J.P. In search of the Indo-Europeans Thames & Hudson (1991) p131 Castes came to be further divided, perhaps as a result of greater specialisation. The \\"classic\\" formulation of the caste system as largely described by Georges Dumézil was that of a priestly or religiously occupied caste, a warrior caste, and a worker caste. Dumézil divided the Proto-Indo-Europeans into three categories: sovereignty, military, and productivity (see Trifunctional hypothesis). He further subdivided sovereignty into two distinct and complementary sub-parts. One part was formal, juridical, and priestly, but rooted in this world. The other was powerful, unpredictable, and also priestly, but rooted in the \\"other\\", the supernatural and spiritual world. The second main division was connected with the use of force, the military, and war. Finally, there was a third group, ruled by the other two, whose role was productivity: herding, farming, and crafts. This system of caste roles can be seen in the castes which flourished on the Indian subcontinent and amongst the Italic peoples. Examples of the Indo-European castes: * Indo-Iranian – Brahmin/Bhumihar Brahmins/Athravan, Kshatriyas/Rathaestar, Vaishyas * Roman – Flamines, Milites, Quirites * Celtic – Druids, Equites, Plebes (according to Julius Caesar) * Anglo-Saxon – Gebedmen (prayer-men), Fyrdmen (army-men), Weorcmen (workmen) (according to Alfred the Great) * Slavic – Volkhvs, Voin, Krestyanin/Smerd * Nordic – Earl, Churl, Thrall (according to the Lay of Rig) * Greece (Attica) – Eupatridae, Geomori, Demiurgi * Greece (Sparta) – Homoioi, Perioeci, Helots Kings were born out of the warrior or noble class. =Medieval Christendom= feudal social structure in three orders: those who pray (oratores), fight (bellatores) and work (laboratores) Europe and the Byzantine Empire AD 1000 Emperor Constantine convoked the First Council of Nicaea in 325 whose Nicene Creed included belief in \\"one holy catholic and apostolic Church\\". Emperor Theodosius I made Nicene Christianity the state church of the Roman Empire with the Edict of Thessalonica of 380.Boyd, William Kenneth (1905). The Ecclesiastical Edicts of the Theodosian Code, Columbia University Press. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century, there emerged no single powerful secular government in the West, but there was a central ecclesiastical power in Rome, the Catholic Church. In this power vacuum, the Church rose to become the dominant power in the West. In essence, the earliest vision of Christendom was a vision of a Christian theocracy, a government founded upon and upholding Christian values, whose institutions are spread through and over with Christian doctrine. The Catholic Church's peak of authority over all European Christians and their common endeavours of the Christian community—for example, the Crusades, the fight against the Moors in the Iberian Peninsula and against the Ottomans in the Balkans—helped to develop a sense of communal identity against the obstacle of Europe's deep political divisions. The classical heritage flourished throughout the Middle Ages in both the Byzantine Greek East and Latin West. In Plato's ideal state there are three major classes (producers, auxiliaries and guardians), which was representative of the idea of the \\"tripartite soul\\", which is expressive of three functions or capacities of the human soul: \\"appetites\\" (or \\"passions\\"), \\"the spirited element\\" and \\"reason\\" the part that must guide the soul to truth. Will Durant made a convincing case that certain prominent features of Plato's ideal community were discernible in the organization, dogma and effectiveness of \\"the\\" Medieval Church in Europe: > For a thousand years Europe was ruled by an order of guardians considerably > like that which was visioned by our philosopher. During the Middle Ages it > was customary to classify the population of Christendom into laboratores > (workers), bellatores (soldiers), and oratores (clergy). The last group, > though small in number, monopolized the instruments and opportunities of > culture, and ruled with almost unlimited sway half of the most powerful > continent on the globe. The clergy, like Plato's guardians, were placed in > authority ... by their talent as shown in ecclesiastical studies and > administration, by their disposition to a life of meditation and simplicity, > and ... by the influence of their relatives with the powers of state and > church. In the latter half of the period in which they ruled [800 AD > onwards], the clergy were as free from family cares as even Plato could > desire [for such guardians] ... [Clerical] Celibacy was part of the > psychological structure of the power of the clergy; for on the one hand they > were unimpeded by the narrowing egoism of the family, and on the other their > apparent superiority to the call of the flesh added to the awe in which lay > sinners held them. ... Gaetano Mosca wrote on the same subject matter in his book The Ruling Class concerning the Medieval Church and its structure that Beyond the fact that Clerical celibacy functioned as a spiritual discipline it also was guarantor of the independence of the Church. > the Catholic Church has always aspired to a preponderant share in political > power, it has never been able to monopolize it entirely, because of two > traits, chiefly, that are basic in its structure. Celibacy has generally > been required of the clergy and of monks. Therefore no real dynasties of > abbots and bishops have ever been able to establish themselves. ... > Secondly, in spite of numerous examples to the contrary supplied by the > warlike Middle Ages, the ecclesiastical calling has by its very nature never > been strictly compatible with the bearing of arms. The precept that exhorts > the Church to abhor bloodshed has never dropped completely out of sight, and > in relatively tranquil and orderly times it has always been very much to the > fore. =Two principal estates of the realm= The fundamental social structure in Europe in the Middle Ages was between the ecclesiastical hierarchy, nobles i.e. the tenants in chivalry (counts, barons, knights, esquires, franklins) and the ignobles, the villeins, citizens, and burgesses. The division of society into classes of nobles and ignobles, in the smaller regions of medieval Europe was inexact. After the Protestant Reformation, social intermingling between the noble class and the hereditary clerical upper class became a feature in the monarchies of Nordic countries. The gentility is primarily formed on the bases of the medieval societies' two higher estates of the realm, nobility and clergy, both exempted from taxation. Subsequent \\"gentle\\" families of long descent who never obtained official rights to bear a coat of arms were also admitted to the rural upper-class society: the gentry. The three estates The widespread three estates order was particularly characteristic of France: * First estate included the group of all clergy, that is, members of the higher clergy and the lower clergy. * Second estate has been encapsulated by the nobility. Here too, it did not matter whether they came from a lower or higher nobility or if they were impoverished members. * Third estate included all nominally free citizens; in some places, free peasants. At the top of the pyramid were the princes and estates of the king or emperor, or with the clergy, the bishops and the pope. The feudal system was, for the people of the Middle Ages and early modern period, fitted into a God-given order. The nobility and the third estate were born into their class, and change in social position was slow. Wealth had little influence on what estate one belonged to. The exception was the Medieval Church, which was the only institution where competent men (and women) of merit could reach, in one lifetime, the highest positions in society. The first estate comprised the entire clergy, traditionally divided into \\"higher\\" and \\"lower\\" clergy. Although there was no formal demarcation between the two categories, the upper clergy were, effectively, clerical nobility, from the families of the second estate or as in the case of Cardinal Wolsey, from more humble backgrounds. The second estate was the nobility. Being wealthy or influential did not automatically make one a noble, and not all nobles were wealthy and influential (aristocratic families have lost their fortunes in various ways, and the concept of the \\"poor nobleman\\" is almost as old as nobility itself). The traditional social stratification of the Western world in the 15th century The nobility of a person might be either inherited or earned. Nobility in its most general and strict sense is an acknowledged preeminence that is hereditary: legitimate descendants (or all male descendants, in some societies) of nobles are nobles, unless explicitly stripped of the privilege. The terms aristocrat and aristocracy are a less formal means to refer to persons belonging to this social milieu. Historically in some cultures, members of an upper class often did not have to work for a living, as they were supported by earned or inherited investments (often real estate), although members of the upper class may have had less actual money than merchants. Upper-class status commonly derived from the social position of one's family and not from one's own achievements or wealth. Much of the population that comprised the upper class consisted of aristocrats, ruling families, titled people, and religious hierarchs. These people were usually born into their status, and historically, there was not much movement across class boundaries. This is to say that it was much harder for an individual to move up in class simply because of the structure of society. In many countries, the term upper class was intimately associated with hereditary land ownership and titles. Political power was often in the hands of the landowners in many pre-industrial societies (which was one of the causes of the French Revolution), despite there being no legal barriers to land ownership for other social classes. Power began to shift from upper-class landed families to the general population in the early modern age, leading to marital alliances between the two groups, providing the foundation for the modern upper classes in the West. Upper-class landowners in Europe were often also members of the titled nobility, though not necessarily: the prevalence of titles of nobility varied widely from country to country. Some upper classes were almost entirely untitled, for example, the Szlachta of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Before the Age of Absolutism, institutions, such as the church, legislatures, or social elites, restrained monarchical power. Absolutism was characterized by the ending of feudal partitioning, consolidation of power with the monarch, rise of state, rise of professional standing armies, professional bureaucracies, the codification of state laws, and the rise of ideologies that justify the absolutist monarchy. Hence, Absolutism was made possible by new innovations and characterized as a phenomenon of Early Modern Europe, rather than that of the Middle Ages, where the clergy and nobility counterbalanced as a result of mutual rivalry. Gentries=Continental Europe=Baltic From the middle of the 1860s the privileged position of Baltic Germans in the Russian Empire began to waver. Already during the reign of Nicholas I (1825–55), who was under pressure from Russian nationalists, some sporadic steps had been taken towards the russification of the provinces. Later, the Baltic Germans faced fierce attacks from the Russian nationalist press, which accused the Baltic aristocracy of separatism, and advocated closer linguistic and administrative integration with Russia. Social division was based on the dominance of the Baltic Germans which formed the upper classes while the majority of indigenous population, called \\"Undeutsch\\", composed the peasantry. In the Imperial census of 1897, 98,573 Germans (7.58% of total population) lived in the Governorate of Livonia, 51,017 (7.57%) in the Governorate of Curonia, and 16,037 (3.89%) in the Governorate of Estonia.. The social changes faced by the emancipation, both social and national, of the Estonians and Latvians where not taken seriously by the Baltic German gentry. The provisional government of Russia after 1917 revolution gave the Estonians and Latvians self-governance which meant the end of the Baltic German era in Baltics. The Lithuanian gentry consisted mainly of Lithuanians, but due to strong ties to Poland, had been culturally Polonized. After the Union of Lublin in 1569, they became less distinguishable from Polish szlachta, although preserved Lithuanian national awareness. Kingdom of Hungary In Hungary during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, gentry (sometimes spelled as dzsentri) were nobility without land who often sought employment as civil servants or army officers, or went into politics. Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth In the history of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, \\"gentry\\" is often used in English to describe the Polish landed gentry (, from ziemia, \\"land\\"). They were the lesser members of the nobility (the szlachta), contrasting with the much smaller but more powerful group of \\"magnate\\" families (sing. magnat, plural magnaci in Polish), the Magnates of Poland and Lithuania. Compared to the situation in England and some other parts of Europe, these two parts of the overall \\"nobility\\" to a large extent operated as different classes, and were often in conflict. After the Partitions of Poland, at least in the stereotypes of 19th-century nationalist lore, the magnates often made themselves at home in the capitals and courts of the partitioning powers, while the gentry remained on their estates, keeping the national culture alive. From the 15th century, only the szlachta, and a few patrician bughers from some cities, were allowed to own rural estates of any size, as part of the very extensive szlachta privileges. These restrictions were reduced or removed after the Partitions of Poland, and commoner landowners began to emerge. By the 19th century, there were at least 60,000 szlachta families, most rather poor, and many no longer owning land. By then the \\"gentry\\" included many non-noble landowners. Spain and Portugal In Spanish nobility and former Portuguese nobility, see hidalgos and infanzones. Sweden In Sweden, there was no outright serfdom. Hence, the gentry was a class of well-off citizens that had grown from the wealthier or more powerful members of the peasantry. The two historically legally privileged classes in Sweden were the Swedish nobility ((Adeln), a rather small group numerically, and the clergy, who were part of the so-called frälse (a classification defined by tax exemptions and representation in the diet). Since 1164, the Archbishop of Uppsala stood at the head of the Swedish clergy. The clergy encompassed almost all the educated men of the day and furthermore was strengthened by considerable wealth, and thus it came naturally to play a significant political role. Until the Reformation, the clergy was the first estate, but it was relegated to the secular estate in Protestant Northern Europe. In the Middle Ages, celibacy in the Catholic Church had been a natural barrier to the formation of an hereditary priestly class. After compulsory celibacy was abolished in Sweden during the Reformation, the formation of a hereditary priestly class became possible, whereby wealth and clerical positions were frequently inheritable. Hence the bishops and the vicars, who formed the clerical upper class, would frequently have manors similar to those of other country gentry. Hence continued the medieval Church legacy of the intermingling between noble class and clerical upper class and the intermarriage as the distinctive element in several Nordic countries after the Reformation. Surnames in Sweden can be traced to the 15th century, when they were first used by the Gentry (Frälse), i.e. priests and nobles. The names of these were usually in Swedish, Latin, German or Greek. Latin names were first adopted by the Catholic clergy in the 15th century. The given name was preceded by Herr (Sir), such as Herr Lars, Herr Olof, Herr Hans, followed by a Latinized form of patronymic: e.g. Lars Petersson Latinized as Laurentius Petri. Starting from the time of the Reformation, the Latinized form of their birthplace (Laurentius Petri Gothus, from Östergötland) became a common naming practice for the clergy. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the surname was only rarely the original family name of the ennobled; usually, a more imposing new name was chosen. This was a period which produced a myriad of two-word Swedish-language family names for the nobility (very favored prefixes were Adler, \\"eagle\\"; Ehren – \\"ära\\", \\"honor\\"; Silfver, \\"silver\\"; and Gyllen, \\"golden\\"). In contrast to Britain, this became the new surname of the whole house, and the old surname was dropped altogether. Ukraine The Western Ukrainian Clergy of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church were a hereditary tight-knit social caste that dominated western Ukrainian society from the late eighteenth until the mid-20th centuries, following the reforms instituted by Joseph II, Emperor of Austria. Because, like their Orthodox brethren, Ukrainian Catholic priests could marry, they were able to establish \\"priestly dynasties\\", often associated with specific regions, for many generations. Numbering approximately 2,000–2,500 by the 19th century, priestly families tended to marry within their group, constituting a tight-knit hereditary caste.. In the absence of a significant native nobility and enjoying a virtual monopoly on education and wealth within western Ukrainian society, the clergy came to form that group's native aristocracy. The clergy adopted Austria's role for them as bringers of culture and education to the Ukrainian countryside. Most Ukrainian social and political movements in Austrian- controlled territory emerged or were highly influenced by the clergy themselves or by their children. This influence was so great that western Ukrainians were accused of wanting to create a theocracy in western Ukraine by their Polish rivals.. The central role played by the Ukrainian clergy or their children in western Ukrainian society would weaken somewhat at the end of the 19th century but would continue until the mid-20th century. =United Kingdom= The British upper classes have historically consisted of two sometimes overlapping entities: the peerage and landed gentry. In the British peerage, only the senior family member (typically the eldest son) inherits a substantive title (duke, marquess, earl, viscount, baron); these are referred to as peers or lords. The rest of the nobility formed part of the \\"landed gentry\\" (abbreviated \\"gentry\\"). The members of the gentry usually bear no titles but could be described as esquire or gentleman. Exceptions are the eldest sons of peers, who bear their fathers' inferior titles as \\"courtesy titles\\" (but for Parliamentary purposes count as commoners), Scottish barons (who bear the designation Baron of X after their name) and baronets (a title corresponding to a hereditary knighthood). Scottish lairds do not have a title of nobility but may have a description of their lands in the form of a territorial designation that forms part of their name. The term landed gentry, although originally used to mean nobility, came to be used for the lesser nobility in England around 1540. Once identical, these terms eventually became complementary. The term gentry by itself, as commonly used by historians, according to Peter Coss, is a construct applied loosely to rather different societies. Any particular model may not fit a specific society, yet a single definition nevertheless remains desirable... The landed gentry is a traditional British social class consisting of gentlemen in the original sense; that is, those who owned land in the form of country estates to such an extent that they were not required to actively work, except in an administrative capacity on their own lands. The estates were often (but not always) made up of tenanted farms, in which case the gentleman could live entirely off rent income. Esquire (abbreviated Esq.) is a term derived from the French \\"écuyer\\" (which also gave equerry) the lowest designation for a nobleman, referring only to males, and used to denote a high but indeterminate social status. The most common occurrence of term Esquire today is the conferral as the (largely obsolete) suffix Esq. in order to pay an informal compliment to a male recipient by way of implying gentle birth. In the post- medieval world, the title of esquire came to apply to all men of the higher landed gentry; an esquire ranked socially above a gentleman but below a knight. In the modern world, where all men are assumed to be gentlemen, the term has often been extended (albeit only in very formal writing) to all men without any higher title. It is used post-nominally, usually in abbreviated form (for example, \\"Thomas Smith, Esq.\\"). A knight could refer to either a medieval tenant who gave military service as a mounted man-at-arms to a feudal landholder, or a medieval gentleman-soldier, usually high-born, raised by a sovereign to privileged military status after training as a page and squire (for a contemporary reference, see British honours system). In formal protocol, Sir is the correct styling for a knight or for a baronet, used with (one of) the knight's given name(s) or full name, but not with the surname alone. The equivalent for a woman who holds the title in her own right is Dame; for such women, the title Dame is used as Sir for a man, never before the surname on its own. This usage was devised in 1917, derived from the practice, up to the 17th century (and still also in legal proceedings), for the wife of a knight. The wife of a knight or baronet is now styled \\"Lady [Surname]\\". =IrishUnited StatesEast Asia=Four occupations The 'four divisions of society' refers to the model of society in ancient China and was a meritocratic social class system in China and other subsequently influenced Confucian societies. The four castes—gentry, farmers, artisans and merchants—are combined to form the term Shìnónggōngshāng (士農工商). Gentry (士) means different things in different countries. In China, Korea, and Vietnam, this meant that the Confucian scholar gentry that would – for the most part – make up most of the bureaucracy. This caste would comprise both the more-or-less hereditary aristocracy as well as the meritocratic scholars that rise through the rank by public service and, later, by imperial exams. Some sources, such as Xunzi, list farmers before the gentry, based on the Confucian view that they directly contributed to the welfare of the state. In China, the farmer lifestyle is also closely linked with the ideals of Confucian gentlemen. In Japan, this caste essentially equates to the samurai class. In the Edo period, with the creation of the Domains (han) under the rule of Tokugawa Ieyasu, all land was confiscated and reissued as fiefdoms to the daimyōs. The small lords, the , were ordered either to give up their swords and rights and remain on their lands as peasants or to move to the castle cities to become paid retainers of the daimyōs. Only a few samurai were allowed to remain in the countryside; the . Some 5 per cent of the population were samurai. Only the samurai could have proper surnames, something that after the Meiji Restoration became compulsory to all inhabitants (see Japanese name). Hierarchical structure of Feudal Japan Matsue daimyō (c. 1850s) Group of Seonbi \\"virtuous scholar\\" in Korea that followed confucian precepts) (c. 18th century) There were two leading classes, i.e. the gentry, in the time of feudal Japan: the daimyō and the samurai. The Confucian ideals in the Japanese culture emphasised the importance of productive members of society, so farmers and fishermen were considered of a higher status than merchants. Emperor Meiji abolished the samurai's right to be the only armed force in favor of a more modern, Western-style, conscripted army in 1873. Samurai became Shizoku (), but the right to wear a katana in public was eventually abolished along with the right to execute commoners who paid them disrespect. In defining how a modern Japan should be, members of the Meiji government decided to follow in the footsteps of the United Kingdom and Germany, basing the country on the concept of noblesse oblige. Samurai were not to be a political force under the new order. The difference between the Japanese and European feudal systems was that European feudalism was grounded in Roman legal structure, while Japan feudalism had Chinese Confucian morality as its basis.. Korea Korean monarchy and the native ruling upper class existed in Korea until the end of the Japanese occupation. The system concerning the nobility is roughly the same as that of the Chinese nobility. As the monastical orders did during Europe's Dark Ages, the Buddhist monks became the purveyors and guardians of Korea's literary traditions while documenting Korea's written history and legacies from the Silla period to the end of the Goryeo dynasty. Korean Buddhist monks also developed and used the first movable metal type printing presses in history—some 500 years before Gutenberg—to print ancient Buddhist texts. Buddhist monks also engaged in record keeping, food storage and distribution, as well as the ability to exercise power by influencing the Goryeo royal court. Values and traditions=Military and clerical= Hungarian nobles, circa 1831 Historically, the nobles in Europe became soldiers; the aristocracy in Europe can trace their origins to military leaders from the migration period and the Middle Ages. For many years, the British Army, together with the Church, was seen as the ideal career for the younger sons of the aristocracy. Although now much diminished, the practice has not totally disappeared. Such practices are not unique to the British either geographically or historically. As a very practical form of displaying patriotism, it has been at times \\"fashionable\\" for \\"gentlemen\\" to participate in the military. The fundamental idea of gentry had come to be that of the essential superiority of the fighting man, usually maintained in the granting of arms. At the last, the wearing of a sword on all occasions was the outward and visible sign of a \\"gentleman\\"; the custom survives in the sword worn with \\"court dress\\". A suggestion that a gentleman must have a coat of arms was vigorously advanced by certain 19th- and 20th- century heraldists, notably Arthur Charles Fox-Davies in England and Thomas Innes of Learney in Scotland. The significance of a right to a coat of arms was that it was definitive proof of the status of gentleman, but it recognised rather than conferred such a status, and the status could be and frequently was accepted without a right to a coat of arms. =Chivalry= A knight being armed. Chivalry is a term related to the medieval institution of knighthood. It is usually associated with ideals of knightly virtues, honour and courtly love. Christianity had a modifying influence on the virtues of chivalry, with limits placed on knights to protect and honour the weaker members of society and maintain peace. The church became more tolerant of war in the defence of faith, espousing theories of the just war. In the 11th century, the concept of a \\"knight of Christ\\" (miles Christi) gained currency in France, Spain and Italy.. These concepts of \\"religious chivalry\\" were further elaborated in the era of the Crusades. In the later Middle Ages, wealthy merchants strove to adopt chivalric attitudes. This was a democratisation of chivalry, leading to a new genre called the courtesy book, which were guides to the behaviour of \\"gentlemen\\". When examining medieval literature, chivalry can be classified into three basic but overlapping areas: # Duties to countrymen and fellow Christians # Duties to God # Duties to women These three areas obviously overlap quite frequently in chivalry and are often indistinguishable. Another classification of chivalry divides it into warrior, religious and courtly love strands. One particular similarity between all three of these categories is honour. Honour is the foundational and guiding principle of chivalry. Thus, for the knight, honour would be one of the guides of action. =Gentleman= A page from Brathwait's book that displays the qualities associated with being a gentleman The term gentleman (from Latin gentilis, belonging to a race or gens, and \\"man\\", cognate with the French word gentilhomme, the Spanish gentilhombre and the Italian gentil uomo or gentiluomo), in its original and strict signification, denoted a man of good family, analogous to the Latin generosus (its invariable translation in English-Latin documents). In this sense the word equates with the French gentilhomme (\\"nobleman\\"), which was in Great Britain long confined to the peerage. The term gentry (from the Old French genterise for gentelise) has much of the social-class significance of the French noblesse or of the German Adel, but without the strict technical requirements of those traditions (such as quarters of nobility). To a degree, gentleman signified a man with an income derived from landed property, a legacy or some other source and was thus independently wealthy and did not need to work. =Confucianism= The Far East also held similar ideas to the West of what a gentleman is, which are based on Confucian principles. The term Jūnzǐ (君子) is a term crucial to classical Confucianism. Literally meaning \\"son of a ruler\\", \\"prince\\" or \\"noble\\", the ideal of a \\"gentleman\\", \\"proper man\\", \\"exemplary person\\", or \\"perfect man\\" is that for which Confucianism exhorts all people to strive. A succinct description of the \\"perfect man\\" is one who \\"combine[s] the qualities of saint, scholar, and gentleman\\" (CE). A hereditary elitism was bound up with the concept, and gentlemen were expected to act as moral guides to the rest of society. They were to: * cultivate themselves morally; * participate in the correct performance of ritual; * show filial piety and loyalty where these are due; and * cultivate humaneness. The opposite of the Jūnzǐ was the Xiǎorén (小人), literally \\"small person\\" or \\"petty person\\". Like English \\"small\\", the word in this context in Chinese can mean petty in mind and heart, narrowly self-interested, greedy, superficial, and materialistic. =Noblesse oblige= The idea of noblesse oblige, \\"nobility obliges\\", among gentry is, as the Oxford English Dictionary expresses, that the term \\"suggests noble ancestry constrains to honorable behaviour; privilege entails to responsibility\\". Being a noble meant that one had responsibilities to lead, manage and so on. One was not to simply spend one's time in idle pursuits. Heraldry Elizabethan pedigree of the de Euro family of Northumberland, barons of Warkworth and Clavering. Scrivened, circa 1570 to 1588 A coat of arms is a heraldic device dating to the 12th century in Europe. It was originally a cloth tunic worn over or in place of armour to establish identity in battle.. The coat of arms is drawn with heraldic rules for a person, family or organisation. Family coats of arms were originally derived from personal ones, which then became extended in time to the whole family. In Scotland, family coats of arms are still personal ones and are mainly used by the head of the family. =Ecclesiastical heraldry= Ecclesiastical heraldry is the tradition of heraldry developed by Christian clergy. Initially used to mark documents, ecclesiastical heraldry evolved as a system for identifying people and dioceses. It is most formalised within the Catholic Church, where most bishops, including the pope, have a personal coat of arms. Clergy in Anglican, Lutheran, Eastern Catholic, and Orthodox churches follow similar customs.

It occurs when an odor binds to a receptor within the nose, transmitting a signal through the olfactory system. Olfaction has many purposes, including detecting hazards, pheromones, and plays a role in taste. Olfaction occurs when odorants bind to specific sites on olfactory receptors located in the nasal cavity. Glomeruli aggregate signals from these receptors and transmit them to the olfactory bulb, where the sensory input will start to interact with parts of the brain responsible for smell identification, memory, and emotion. There are many different causes for alteration, lack, or disturbance to normal olfaction, and can include damage to the peripheral nose or smell receptors, or central problems affecting the brain. Some causes include upper respiratory infections, traumatic brain injury, and neurodegenerative disease.  Vertebrates =Main olfactory system= In humans and other vertebrates, smells are sensed by olfactory sensory neurons in the olfactory epithelium. The olfactory epithelium is made up of at least six morphologically and biochemically different cell types. The proportion of olfactory epithelium compared to respiratory epithelium (not innervated, or supplied with nerves) gives an indication of the animal's olfactory sensitivity. Humans have about of olfactory epithelium, whereas some dogs have . A dog's olfactory epithelium is also considerably more densely innervated, with a hundred times more receptors per square centimeter. The sensory olfactory system integrates with other senses to form the perception of flavor. Often, land organisms will have separate olfaction systems for smell and taste (orthonasal smell and retronasal smell), but water-dwelling organisms usually have only one system. Molecules of odorants passing through the superior nasal concha of the nasal passages dissolve in the mucus that lines the superior portion of the cavity and are detected by olfactory receptors on the dendrites of the olfactory sensory neurons. This may occur by diffusion or by the binding of the odorant to odorant-binding proteins. The mucus overlying the epithelium contains mucopolysaccharides, salts, enzymes, and antibodies (these are highly important, as the olfactory neurons provide a direct passage for infection to pass to the brain). This mucus acts as a solvent for odor molecules, flows constantly, and is replaced approximately every ten minutes. In insects, smells are sensed by olfactory sensory neurons in the chemosensory sensilla, which are present in insect antenna, palps, and tarsa, but also on other parts of the insect body. Odorants penetrate into the cuticle pores of chemosensory sensilla and get in contact with insect odorant- binding proteins (OBPs) or Chemosensory proteins (CSPs), before activating the sensory neurons. =Receptor neuron= The binding of the ligand (odor molecule or odorant) to the receptor leads to an action potential in the receptor neuron, via a second messenger pathway, depending on the organism. In mammals, the odorants stimulate adenylate cyclase to synthesize cAMP via a G protein called Golf. cAMP, which is the second messenger here, opens a cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel (CNG), producing an influx of cations (largely Ca2+ with some Na+) into the cell, slightly depolarising it. The Ca2+ in turn opens a Ca2+-activated chloride channel, leading to efflux of Cl−, further depolarizing the cell and triggering an action potential. Ca2+ is then extruded through a sodium-calcium exchanger. A calcium-calmodulin complex also acts to inhibit the binding of cAMP to the cAMP-dependent channel, thus contributing to olfactory adaptation. The main olfactory system of some mammals also contains small subpopulations of olfactory sensory neurons that detect and transduce odors somewhat differently. Olfactory sensory neurons that use trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs) to detect odors use the same second messenger signaling cascade as do the canonical olfactory sensory neurons. Other subpopulations, such as those that express the receptor guanylyl cyclase GC-D (Gucy2d) or the soluble guanylyl cyclase Gucy1b2, use a cGMP cascade to transduce their odorant ligands. These distinct subpopulations (olfactory subsystems) appear specialized for the detection of small groups of chemical stimuli. This mechanism of transduction is somewhat unusual, in that cAMP works by directly binding to the ion channel rather than through activation of protein kinase A. It is similar to the transduction mechanism for photoreceptors, in which the second messenger cGMP works by directly binding to ion channels, suggesting that maybe one of these receptors was evolutionarily adapted into the other. There are also considerable similarities in the immediate processing of stimuli by lateral inhibition. Averaged activity of the receptor neurons can be measured in several ways. In vertebrates, responses to an odor can be measured by an electro-olfactogram or through calcium imaging of receptor neuron terminals in the olfactory bulb. In insects, one can perform electroantennography or calcium imaging within the olfactory bulb. =Olfactory bulb projections= Schematic of the early olfactory system including the olfactory epithelium and bulb. Each ORN expresses one OR that responds to different odorants. Odorant molecules bind to ORs on cilia. ORs activate ORNs that transduce the input signal into action potentials. In general, glomeruli receive input from ORs of one specific type and connect to the principal neurons of the OB, mitral and tufted cells (MT cells). Olfactory sensory neurons project axons to the brain within the olfactory nerve, (cranial nerveI). These nerve fibers, lacking myelin sheaths, pass to the olfactory bulb of the brain through perforations in the cribriform plate, which in turn projects olfactory information to the olfactory cortex and other areas. The axons from the olfactory receptors converge in the outer layer of the olfactory bulb within small (≈50 micrometers in diameter) structures called glomeruli. Mitral cells, located in the inner layer of the olfactory bulb, form synapses with the axons of the sensory neurons within glomeruli and send the information about the odor to other parts of the olfactory system, where multiple signals may be processed to form a synthesized olfactory perception. A large degree of convergence occurs, with 25,000 axons synapsing on 25 or so mitral cells, and with each of these mitral cells projecting to multiple glomeruli. Mitral cells also project to periglomerular cells and granular cells that inhibit the mitral cells surrounding it (lateral inhibition). Granular cells also mediate inhibition and excitation of mitral cells through pathways from centrifugal fibers and the anterior olfactory nuclei. Neuromodulators like acetylcholine, serotonin and norepinephrine all send axons to the olfactory bulb and have been implicated in gain modulation, pattern separation, and memory functions, respectively. The mitral cells leave the olfactory bulb in the lateral olfactory tract, which synapses on five major regions of the cerebrum: the anterior olfactory nucleus, the olfactory tubercle, the amygdala, the piriform cortex, and the entorhinal cortex. The anterior olfactory nucleus projects, via the anterior commissure, to the contralateral olfactory bulb, inhibiting it. The piriform cortex has two major divisions with anatomically distinct organizations and functions. The anterior piriform cortex (APC) appears to be better at determining the chemical structure of the odorant molecules, and the posterior piriform cortex (PPC) has a strong role in categorizing odors and assessing similarities between odors (e.g. minty, woody, and citrus are odors that can, despite being highly variant chemicals, be distinguished via the PPC in a concentration-independent manner). The piriform cortex projects to the medial dorsal nucleus of the thalamus, which then projects to the orbitofrontal cortex. The orbitofrontal cortex mediates conscious perception of the odor (citation needed). The three-layered piriform cortex projects to a number of thalamic and hypothalamic nuclei, the hippocampus and amygdala and the orbitofrontal cortex, but its function is largely unknown. The entorhinal cortex projects to the amygdala and is involved in emotional and autonomic responses to odor. It also projects to the hippocampus and is involved in motivation and memory. Odor information is stored in long-term memory and has strong connections to emotional memory. This is possibly due to the olfactory system's close anatomical ties to the limbic system and hippocampus, areas of the brain that have long been known to be involved in emotion and place memory, respectively. Since any one receptor is responsive to various odorants, and there is a great deal of convergence at the level of the olfactory bulb, it may seem strange that human beings are able to distinguish so many different odors. It seems that a highly complex form of processing must be occurring; however, as it can be shown that, while many neurons in the olfactory bulb (and even the pyriform cortex and amygdala) are responsive to many different odors, half the neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex are responsive to only one odor, and the rest to only a few. It has been shown through microelectrode studies that each individual odor gives a particular spatial map of excitation in the olfactory bulb. It is possible that the brain is able to distinguish specific odors through spatial encoding, but temporal coding must also be taken into account. Over time, the spatial maps change, even for one particular odor, and the brain must be able to process these details as well. Inputs from the two nostrils have separate inputs to the brain, with the result that, when each nostril takes up a different odorant, a person may experience perceptual rivalry in the olfactory sense akin to that of binocular rivalry. In insects, smells are sensed by sensilla located on the antenna and maxillary palp and first processed by the antennal lobe (analogous to the olfactory bulb), and next by the mushroom bodies and lateral horn. =Coding and perception= The process by which olfactory information is coded in the brain to allow for proper perception is still being researched, and is not completely understood. When an odorant is detected by receptors, they in a sense break the odorant down, and then the brain puts the odorant back together for identification and perception. The odorant binds to receptors that recognize only a specific functional group, or feature, of the odorant, which is why the chemical nature of the odorant is important. After binding the odorant, the receptor is activated and will send a signal to the glomeruli. Each glomerulus receives signals from multiple receptors that detect similar odorant features. Because several receptor types are activated due to the different chemical features of the odorant, several glomeruli are activated as well. All of the signals from the glomeruli are then sent to the brain, where the combination of glomeruli activation encodes the different chemical features of the odorant. The brain then essentially puts the pieces of the activation pattern back together in order to identify and perceive the odorant. This distributed code allows the brain to detect specific odors in mixtures of many background odors. It is a general idea that the layout of brain structures corresponds to physical features of stimuli (called topographic coding), and similar analogies have been made in olfaction with concepts such as a layout corresponding to chemical features (called chemotopy) or perceptual features. While chemotopy remains a highly controversial concept, evidence exists for perceptual information implemented in the spatial dimensions of olfactory networks. Although conventional wisdom and lay literature, based on impressionistic findings in the 1920s, have long presented human olfaction as capable of distinguishing between roughly 10,000 unique odors, recent research has suggested that the average individual is capable of distinguishing over one trillion unique odors. Researchers in the most recent study, which tested the psychophysical responses to combinations of over 128 unique odor molecules with combinations composed of up to 30 different component molecules, noted that this estimate is \\"conservative\\" and that some subjects of their research might be capable of deciphering between a thousand trillion odorants, adding that their worst performer could probably still distinguish between 80million scents. Authors of the study concluded, \\"This is far more than previous estimates of distinguishable olfactory stimuli. It demonstrates that the human olfactory system, with its hundreds of different olfactory receptors, far out performs the other senses in the number of physically different stimuli it can discriminate.\\" However, it was also noted by the authors that the ability to distinguish between smells is not analogous to being able to consistently identify them, and that subjects were not typically capable of identifying individual odor stimulants from within the odors the researchers had prepared from multiple odor molecules. In November 2014 the study was strongly criticized by Caltech scientist Markus Meister, who wrote that the study's \\"extravagant claims are based on errors of mathematical logic\\". The logic of his paper has in turn been criticized by the authors of the original paper. =Accessory olfactory system= Many animals, including most mammals and reptiles, but not humans, have two distinct and segregated olfactory systems: a main olfactory system, which detects volatile stimuli, and an accessory olfactory system, which detects fluid-phase stimuli. Behavioral evidence suggests that these fluid-phase stimuli often function as pheromones, although pheromones can also be detected by the main olfactory system. In the accessory olfactory system, stimuli are detected by the vomeronasal organ, located in the vomer, between the nose and the mouth. Snakes use it to smell prey, sticking their tongue out and touching it to the organ. Some mammals make a facial expression called flehmen to direct stimuli to this organ. The sensory receptors of the accessory olfactory system are located in the vomeronasal organ. As in the main olfactory system, the axons of these sensory neurons project from the vomeronasal organ to the accessory olfactory bulb, which in the mouse is located on the dorsal-posterior portion of the main olfactory bulb. Unlike in the main olfactory system, the axons that leave the accessory olfactory bulb do not project to the brain's cortex but rather to targets in the amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and from there to the hypothalamus, where they may influence aggression and mating behavior. =Genetics= Different people smell different odors, and most of these differences are caused by genetic differences. Although odorant receptor genes make up one of the largest gene families in the human genome, only a handful of genes have been linked conclusively to particular smells. For instance, the odorant receptor OR5A1 and its genetic variants (alleles) are responsible for our ability (or failure) to smell β-ionone, a key aroma in foods and beverages. Similarly, the odorant receptor OR2J3 is associated with the ability to detect the \\"grassy\\" odor, cis-3-hexen-1-ol. The preference (or dislike) of cilantro (coriander) has been linked to the olfactory receptor OR6A2. =Additional roles=Taste Flavor perception is an aggregation of auditory, taste, haptic, and smell sensory information. Retronasal smell plays the biggest role in the sensation of flavor. During the process of mastication, the tongue manipulates food to release odorants. These odorants enter the nasal cavity during exhalation. The olfaction of food has the sensation of being in the mouth because of co-activation of the motor cortex and olfactory epithelium during mastication. Olfaction, taste, and trigeminal receptors (also called chemesthesis) together contribute to flavor. The human tongue can distinguish only among five distinct qualities of taste, while the nose can distinguish among hundreds of substances, even in minute quantities. It is during exhalation that the olfaction contribution to flavor occurs, in contrast to that of proper smell, which occurs during the inhalation phase of breathing. The olfactory system is the only human sense that bypasses the thalamus and connects directly to the forebrain. Hearing Olfaction and sound information has been shown to converge in the olfactory tubercles of rodents. This neural convergence is proposed to give rise to a perception termed smound. Whereas a flavor results from interactions between smell and taste, a smound may result from interactions between smell and sound. Inbreeding avoidance The MHC genes (known as HLA in humans) are a group of genes present in many animals and important for the immune system; in general, offspring from parents with differing MHC genes have a stronger immune system. Fish, mice, and female humans are able to smell some aspect of the MHC genes of potential sex partners and prefer partners with MHC genes different from their own. Humans can detect blood relatives from olfaction. Mothers can identify by body odor their biological children but not their stepchildren. Pre-adolescent children can olfactorily detect their full siblings but not half-siblings or step siblings, and this might explain incest avoidance and the Westermarck effect. Functional imaging shows that this olfactory kinship detection process involves the frontal-temporal junction, the insula, and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, but not the primary or secondary olfactory cortices, or the related piriform cortex or orbitofrontal cortex. Since inbreeding is detrimental, it tends to be avoided. In the house mouse, the major urinary protein (MUP) gene cluster provides a highly polymorphic scent signal of genetic identity that appears to underlie kin recognition and inbreeding avoidance. Thus, there are fewer matings between mice sharing MUP haplotypes than would be expected if there were random mating. =Specific animals= The importance and sensitivity of smell varies among different organisms; most mammals have a good sense of smell, whereas most birds do not, except the tubenoses (e.g., petrels and albatrosses), certain species of vultures, and the kiwis. Although, recent analysis of the chemical composition of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from King Penguin feathers suggest that VOCs may provide olfactory cues, used by the penguins to locate their colony and recognise individuals. Among mammals, it is well developed in the carnivores and ungulates, which must always be aware of each other, and in those that smell for their food, such as moles. Having a strong sense of smell is referred to as macrosmatic. Figures suggesting greater or lesser sensitivity in various species reflect experimental findings from the reactions of animals exposed to aromas in known extreme dilutions. These are, therefore, based on perceptions by these animals, rather than mere nasal function. That is, the brain's smell- recognizing centers must react to the stimulus detected for the animal to be said to show a response to the smell in question. It is estimated that dogs, in general, have an olfactory sense approximately ten thousand to a hundred thousand times more acute than a human's. This does not mean they are overwhelmed by smells our noses can detect; rather, it means they can discern a molecular presence when it is in much greater dilution in the carrier, air. Scenthounds as a group can smell one- to ten-million times more acutely than a human, and bloodhounds, which have the keenest sense of smell of any dogs, have noses ten- to one-hundred-million times more sensitive than a human's. They were bred for the specific purpose of tracking humans, and can detect a scent trail a few days old. The second-most-sensitive nose is possessed by the Basset Hound, which was bred to track and hunt rabbits and other small animals. Bears, such as the Silvertip Grizzly found in parts of North America, have a sense of smell seven times stronger than that of the bloodhound, essential for locating food underground. Using their elongated claws, bears dig deep trenches in search of burrowing animals and nests as well as roots, bulbs, and insects. Bears can detect the scent of food from up to eighteen miles away; because of their immense size, they often scavenge new kills, driving away the predators (including packs of wolves and human hunters) in the process. The sense of smell is less developed in the catarrhine primates, and nonexistent in cetaceans, which compensate with a well-developed sense of taste. In some strepsirrhines, such as the red-bellied lemur, scent glands occur atop the head. In many species, olfaction is highly tuned to pheromones; a male silkworm moth, for example, can sense a single molecule of bombykol. Fish, too, have a well-developed sense of smell, even though they inhabit an aquatic environment. Salmon utilize their sense of smell to identify and return to their home stream waters. Catfish use their sense of smell to identify other individual catfish and to maintain a social hierarchy. Many fishes use the sense of smell to identify mating partners or to alert to the presence of food. Insects Insect olfaction refers to the function of chemical receptors that enable insects to detect and identify volatile compounds for foraging, predator avoidance, finding mating partners (via pheromones) and locating oviposition habitats. Thus, it is the most important sensation for insects. Most important insect behaviors must be timed perfectly which is dependent on what they smell and when they smell it. For example, olfaction is essential for hunting in many species of wasps, including Polybia sericea. The two organs insects primarily use for detecting odors are the antennae and specialized mouth parts called the maxillary palps. However, a recent study has demonstrated the olfactory role of ovipositor in fig wasps. Inside of these olfactory organs there are neurons called olfactory receptor neurons which, as the name implies, house receptors for scent molecules in their cell membrane. The majority of olfactory receptor neurons typically reside in the antenna. These neurons can be very abundant, for example Drosophila flies have 2,600 olfactory sensory neurons. Insects are capable of smelling and differentiating between thousands of volatile compounds both sensitively and selectively. Sensitivity is how attuned the insect is to very small amounts of an odorant or small changes in the concentration of an odorant. Selectivity refers to the insects ability to tell one odorant apart from another. These compounds are commonly broken into three classes: short chain carboxylic acids, aldehydes and low molecular weight nitrogenous compounds. Some insects, such as the moth Deilephila elpenor, use olfaction as a means to find food sources. Plants The tendrils of plants are especially sensitive to airborne volatile organic compounds. Parasites such as dodder make use of this in locating their preferred hosts and locking on to them. The emission of volatile compounds is detected when foliage is browsed by animals. Threatened plants are then able to take defensive chemical measures, such as moving tannin compounds to their foliage. Machines Nasal Ranger, an olfactometer, in use Scientists have devised methods for quantifying the intensity of odors, in particular for the purpose of analyzing unpleasant or objectionable odors released by an industrial source into a community. Since the 1800s industrial countries have encountered incidents where proximity of an industrial source or landfill produced adverse reactions among nearby residents regarding airborne odor. The basic theory of odor analysis is to measure what extent of dilution with \\"pure\\" air is required before the sample in question is rendered indistinguishable from the \\"pure\\" or reference standard. Since each person perceives odor differently, an \\"odor panel\\" composed of several different people is assembled, each sniffing the same sample of diluted specimen air. A field olfactometer can be utilized to determine the magnitude of an odor. Many air management districts in the US have numerical standards of acceptability for the intensity of odor that is allowed to cross into a residential property. For example, the Bay Area Air Quality Management District has applied its standard in regulating numerous industries, landfills, and sewage treatment plants. Example applications this district has engaged are the San Mateo, California, wastewater treatment plant; the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, California; and the IT Corporation waste ponds, Martinez, California.  Classification  Systems of classifying odors include: * Crocker-Henderson system, which rates smells on a 0-8 scale for each of four \\"primary\\" smells: fragrant, acid, burnt, and caprylic. * Henning's prism * Zwaardemaker smell system (invented by Hendrik Zwaardemaker) Disorders Specific terms are used to describe disorders associated with smelling: *Anosmia – inability to smell *Hyperosmia – an abnormally acute sense of smell *Hyposmia – decreased ability to smell *Presbyosmia – the natural decline in the sense of smell in old age *Dysosmia – distortion in the sense of smell Parosmia – distortion in the perception of an odor Phantosmia – distortion in the absence of an odor, \\"hallucinated smell\\" * Heterosmia – inability to distinguish odors *Olfactory reference syndrome – psychological disorder that causes the patient to imagine he or she has strong body odor * Osmophobia – aversion or psychological hypersensitivity to odors History The Lady and the Unicorn, a Flemish tapestry depicting the sense of smell, 1484–1500. Musée national du Moyen Âge, Paris. Early scientific study of olfaction includes the extensive doctoral dissertation of Eleanor Gamble, published in 1898, which compared olfactory to other stimulus modalities, and implied that smell had a lower intensity discrimination. As the Epicurean and atomistic Roman philosopher Lucretius (1stcentury BCE) speculated, different odors are attributed to different shapes and sizes of \\"atoms\\" (odor molecules in the modern understanding) that stimulate the olfactory organ. A modern demonstration of that theory was the cloning of olfactory receptor proteins by Linda B. Buck and Richard Axel (who were awarded the Nobel Prize in 2004), and subsequent pairing of odor molecules to specific receptor proteins. Each odor receptor molecule recognizes only a particular molecular feature or class of odor molecules. Mammals have about a thousand genes that code for odor reception. Of the genes that code for odor receptors, only a portion are functional. Humans have far fewer active odor receptor genes than other primates and other mammals. In mammals, each olfactory receptor neuron expresses only one functional odor receptor. Odor receptor nerve cells function like a key–lock system: if the airborne molecules of a certain chemical can fit into the lock, the nerve cell will respond. There are, at present, a number of competing theories regarding the mechanism of odor coding and perception. According to the shape theory, each receptor detects a feature of the odor molecule. The weak-shape theory, known as the odotope theory, suggests that different receptors detect only small pieces of molecules, and these minimal inputs are combined to form a larger olfactory perception (similar to the way visual perception is built up of smaller, information-poor sensations, combined and refined to create a detailed overall perception). According to a new study, researchers have found that a functional relationship exists between molecular volume of odorants and the olfactory neural response. An alternative theory, the vibration theory proposed by Luca Turin, posits that odor receptors detect the frequencies of vibrations of odor molecules in the infrared range by quantum tunnelling. However, the behavioral predictions of this theory have been called into question. See also the editorial on p. 315. There is no theory yet that explains olfactory perception completely.

The movie was written and directed by Jose Javier Reyes. Batang PX earned several awards and nominations from different award-giving bodies and was also responsible for bringing Patrick Garcia to stardom. The film tackles domestic violence and the Filipino-American children who were abandoned by their American fathers after the withdrawal of the American forces in the country in the 1990s. The film was restored by the ABS-CBN Film Archives through the film restoration facilities of Central Digital Lab in Makati City. Synopsis The Philippines is considered as one of the biggest U.S. military bases in the world. It is not surprising that the population of Filipino- American children has risen. Most of them have fathers who abandoned them as soon as these fathers are re-stationed. Amboy, played by Patrick Garcia, is one of the Fil-Am kids patiently anticipating his father's homecoming and yearning to meet him. Stories from Amboy's mom are the only things he knows about his father. His wish is granted when he finally meets his father. However, things don't turn out the way they were planned.  Plot  The flashback, narrated by Amboy, begins at the young life of his mother Tessie who lived with her abusive and complaining mother in Olongapo City, Zambales, the place where many Fil-Am children abandoned by their American fathers. Tessie was a loner and she hated her mother all the time because of her uncaring, unforgiving, arrogant nature towards her in which Tessie wants to run away from her. One night, she escaped from her abusive mother and employed as a hostess in a nightclub where she sings for the customers at the red-light district of the city. In that time, she met an American soldier from Baltimore, Maryland named Michael Dahoff whom he fell in love with Tessie. A few months later, Tessie's evil mother arrived at the house where she and the American lived and she violently threatens them by calling the police. Suddenly, Michael went outside to confront her but she endlessly attacks him physically and verbally (for instance, racist) and she blames him for Tessie where she will never forgive her for everything even after her death. While Michael continuously complains to the woman, Tessie was revealed to be pregnant. Later, she gave birth to a baby boy whom Michael named him Christopher whose nickname \\"Amboy\\" in Manila. Moments later, Michael was reassigned to the overseas but he promised Tessie and Amboy that he will return someday. Years later, Amboy, now a teenage boy, lived with his mother Tessie in Manila. One night, they left the apartment in order to avoid being kicked out by the owner because they didn't pay their rent and then, they temporarily live at the house of Tessie's friend Sarah who was surprised from her non-sense. The following day, Tessie rented a house at Aling Cedes' compound where she will pay the rent with advance payments as she promised to her. While living in the new house, Amboy met new friends in the neighborhood including Angela, a young girl of his age and Aling Cedes' granddaughter and Jessie, Aling Cedes' son who is a young mechanic where Amboy helps. Moments later, Tessie works at the shoe section of a department store but she was angrily complained by her cold-blooded boss due to her hostile attitude towards the customers. While working as a singer at the cabaret, she met Danny, an executive from a car dealership company at her workplace. The two became closer as Danny lived at their house and bought new things for them but Amboy was very hostile towards him. One day, a woman arrived at the compound which is Danny's other woman Monica whom she found out that he lived with another woman but Danny expels her from the scene by getting her inside the taxi as many people in the neighborhood witnessed everything. Later, Tessie seriously asks Danny about the woman but she constantly tells the reasons about it until Danny broke a plate which indicates the beginning of domestic abuse. In one afternoon, Amboy discovers his bike is missing and he told his friends to find it until they found out that it was stolen by a group of hostile teenagers. As Amboy tried to recover his bike and received threats from them, the thug destroys it completely, leaving Amboy vowed for revenge. In the same day, Danny was summoned by his boss about the computations of the dealership's profits in which he haven't made. The following day, Amboy, along with his friends, retaliates by loosen the tires of the car owned by a thug using the Swiss Army knife. Meanwhile, Danny reveals to Tessie that he was fired by his boss or he will be punished for stealing finances from the company, leaving him to become a jobless man. A moment later, Aling Cedes called Tessie and Danny where they encounter the father of the thug man whom he blames Amboy for destroying the car with a Swiss Army knife which was left in the trail. Seeing that he has gotten too far, Danny punishes Amboy for the trouble he caused and with the whole neighborhood witnessed their act, Tessie was tearfully shocked and awed. The punishment ended up Amboy having bruises in his eye. Days later, Danny becomes a violent and alcoholic man whom he slacked off most of the time as Tessie works in her new workplace at the restaurant. A day later, the people of the organization for the Fil-Am children who were left by their American serviceperson parents discovered Amboy and they told him and Tessie that Michael Dahoff returned in the country. The following day, Amboy finally reunites with his American father Michael who was married and had four children in Baltimore. Later at the household, Amboy received a lot of stuff from his father especially for Tessie who refused to accept it because of her grudge of him abandoning her in the first place. Minutes later, Angela went to Amboy where they converse about his father and his personal problems. Unfortunately, their talk cut short when a heated confrontation between Danny and Tessie when the former steals money that the latter received from Michael and it got even violent when Amboy attacks Danny but ended up being locked inside the bathroom and also, Angela and her family tried to end their fistfight but they ended up to witness. The violence ends with Tessie having bruises in her face after she kicked his groin for causing all the trouble. Amboy suggests either expel Danny out of their house or escape everywhere but Tessie doesn't agree with because Danny might get revenge. When Amboy suggested that he will go to his father in the United States, Tessie was mad because she blamed Amboy for ruining her life due to her struggles of raising him and this left Amboy hurt. The following day, Amboy joins his father to go to Baltimore but he doesn't agree to bring him to America without a reason. After learning he can't go to the US, Amboy leaves the room but Michael stopped him for a bit when he gave dollars to him before he says goodbye for him and he vowed to see him again someday and this led Amboy being saddened for the response and accepted. After Amboy left the hotel and accepts the money from his father, Tessie angrily asks Danny about her money in her moneybox but the latter tells her to shut up. Tessie got even mad and he started to blame Danny for being a type of bastard when she knew that he stole the money that she hid in her personal belongings. Tessie continues to blame Danny for everything and she calls him a \\"selfish asshole who doesn't love others\\" and also, \\"an addicted drunkard\\". Danny, who overheard her statements against his self, gets angrier and he starts to destroy every furniture he bought for her including the porcelain and the TV set. The destruction of things led Tessie wants to kick him out and Danny becomes infuriated and he beats her severely. As Amboy goes near to their house, his neighbors tell him about his mother and he immediately runs to his mother who had suffered many bruises in her face. As Amboy goes to her room, Tessie apologizes and hugs her son for everything she had sinned for him and Amboy promised that he will never leave his mother behind. The following night, a noise was heard at the living room and Amboy unleashes his baseball bat for defense if an intruder was here but Tessie handled it instead. As they go to the living room, they found Danny, who was drunk and currently expelled from the household, in the chair but he woke up when he noticed the two especially Tessie who has a weapon in her hands. Tessie and Amboy tell him that he must go out and never return. Danny retaliates but Tessie seriously threatens to kill him with a baseball bat if he attacks her son and Danny tells her that they will never survive without him. Enraged from his words, Tessie started to attack him and Danny tries to snatch the bat. As Danny tries to kill Amboy, Tessie successfully hits Danny to death with a baseball bat three times although unconscious. The raucous also attracted the attention of Aling Cedes and her family in which they were shocked from the incident. Aling Cedes finally told them that Danny is a complete psycho in the neighborhood. In the end, Amboy will remain to be the only male of the family after Tessie promised she will never have another boyfriend. Tessie has found a new job in the salon because she decided to work at daytime. Amboy continues his studies because she doesn't like to see her son as an uneducated person and also, he continues to help as a mechanic with Jessie and his colleagues in exchange for daily allowances. The film ends with Tessie and Amboy going to the mall after her work shift was done and they will bond together as mother and son.

The film also shatters with irrevocable and poignant energy the nostalgic reckoning of family as a functioning and nuclear whole; it contends that the mother and her son are better off without a man in their lives. The boy's father, an American soldier, leaves the mother after the Philippine government has abrogated the US Bases Treaty and the mother, who used to be a singer, later lives with a boyfriend who turns out to be a corrupt businessman, an opportunist, and a wife-beater. The film lays bare discrepancies between the longing for the restoration of the familial order, and the asymmetrical power relations which make that order detrimental to the humanity of its members. This melodrama, therefore, assumes the dimensions of a political fable about people who look for love in the wrong places and find it on the run. The title role is played by a young actor, Patrick Garcia, who bears the full weight of his film's dilemmas, but never shows signs of weariness, only the strain of a kind of portrayal that acts, thinks, and makes sense of experience with the wish not so much to shift the burden of living with the imperialist trauma as to share it as part of the collective predicament. His character embodies the terms of his name Amboy or Batang PX, again allegorizing his nation as an American commissary of duty-free labor.Flores, Patrick. \\"The Illusions of a Cinematic President.\\" Public Policy 2.4 (1998): 101-19.

Early and personal life Brian Patrick Carroll was born on May 13, 1969 to Tom (died 2014) and Nancy Carroll (died 2013) and is the youngest of five siblings along with Lynn, Lisa, Lori, and John. His father was the Athletic Director at Damien High School from 1973 until his retirement in 2013. Carroll grew up in a Southern California suburb not far from Disneyland. In his youth, he was an introverted child and spent most of his time in his room, which was filled with comic books, games, martial-arts movie memorabilia, and toys. He also spent a lot of time at Disneyland. Carroll began playing guitar at the age of 12. He learned how to play from an elderly man who lived down the road, who died before Carroll moved. He had been quoted as saying, however, that he did not become serious until a year later when he moved from Huntington Beach, California to Claremont. His playing began improving by taking private lessons from various teachers at a local music store. His early teachers included Max McGuire, Johnny Fortune, Mark Hammond, Pebber Brown, Joey Tafolla and Paul Gilbert. Buckethead played a tribute to all his early teachers when the Deli Creeps played a show at Styles Music's 25th anniversary. He then began making demo recordings of both his playing as well as his writing styles, which would later be released in 2007–2008. The Buckethead persona came to be when Carroll saw the 1988 horror movie Halloween 4 and was inspired by the film. He went out right after seeing it and bought a Michael Myers-like white mask. The bucket idea came later that night while eating chicken: In October 2017, Carroll gave a rare out-of-character interview discussing all ranges of his life, the Buckethead character, his parents' deaths, his health problems, and how he copes with overcoming fear. During the podcast, he revealed he has been diagnosed with the potentially life-threatening condition of heart arrhythmia. He stated he had a cardiac ablation performed and uses medicine to control the problem. Career=1988–94: Early solo career and Praxis= In 1988 after leaving the band Class-X, Carroll entered a song called \\"Brazos\\" into a Guitar Player magazine contest. It was a runner-up, with editors writing: In the same year, the magazine's editor, Jas Obrecht, came to know of Buckethead when Carroll and his parents left a demo recording at the magazine's reception desk for Obrecht. Impressed with this demo, he rushed into the restaurant where Buckethead and his parents were having lunch and encouraged him to make the most of his talent. They soon became friends. In 1989 a song called \\"Soowee\\" by Buckethead got honorable mention in another song contest. In 1991, Buckethead moved into Obrecht's basement. The song \\"Brazos\\" was eventually released on the 1991 demo tape of his band Deli Creeps, titled \\"Tribal Rites,\\" and again as bonus material in Buckethead's Secret Recipe DVD in 2006. Luke Sacco was his teacher. In 1991 Buckethead contributed to Derek Bailey's Company project alongside, among others, John Zorn and Alexander Bălănescu, resulting in a triple album called Company 91. After his first two demo tapes, called Giant Robot and Bucketheadland Blueprints, Buckethead released Bucketheadland on John Zorn's Japanese Avant record label in 1992. Though available only as a pricey import, the record received positive reviews and earned some attention. At about this time, Buckethead fell into the orbit of prolific bassist/producer Bill Laswell, himself an occasional Zorn collaborator; Buckethead (as a performer, producer, or composer) was introduced to Laswell with the help of Limbomaniacs drummer Bryan \\"Brain\\" Mantia, who gave Laswell a video of Buckethead playing in his room. Buckethead soon became Laswell's second staple guitar player, besides Nicky Skopelitis. In 1992, Buckethead, with Bill Laswell, Bernie Worrell, Bootsy Collins, and Bryan \\"Brain\\" Mantia, formed the supergroup Praxis. Their first album, Transmutation (Mutatis Mutandis), released the same year, was well received. The project was Bill Laswell's concept, and has since involved other guests such as Serj Tankian of System of a Down, among many others. Buckethead participated in every release except the initial 1984 release and Mold (1998). In 1993, Buckethead auditioned to play for the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The band eventually ended up with Arik Marshall, and later Dave Navarro. After some legal complications with Sony Music Entertainment, Buckethead decided to release his 1994 album Dreamatorium under the name of Death Cube K (an anagram). Buckethead released a second studio album that year, Giant Robot, which features many guest appearances by artists such as Iggy Pop and Bill Moseley. The name of the album came from the Japanese series Johnny Sokko and his Flying Robot, of which Buckethead is a fan. He also released two other albums with Praxis, their second and third studio efforts: Sacrifist and Metatron. =1995–99: Collaboration work, movie soundtracks and Praxis= In 1995, Buckethead did not release any solo albums but collaborated with several artists like Jonas Hellborg and Michael Shrieve (Octave of the Holy Innocents). He also contributed to several movie soundtracks, such as Johnny Mnemonic and Mortal Kombat. Later, in 1996, Buckethead released his solo album The Day of the Robot with the help of English producer DJ Ninj and Laswell, plus another album with Brain and keyboardist Pete Scaturro on the small Japanese label NTT Records, called Giant Robot. Both albums were printed only in small quantities and are collectors' items now. A second demo tape by the Deli Creeps was also recorded. Also in 1996 several Sega Saturn television ads featuring a screaming mask-like face pressing through the blue orb of the Saturn logo was released, with music by Buckethead. In 1997, Buckethead began working on the album Buckethead Plays Disney, but the album has not yet been released. According to his Web page: Also in 1997, Buckethead continued to contribute to movie soundtracks, appearing on Beverly Hills Ninja and Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, the sequel to Mortal Kombat. Further releases were Arcana's second and final studio album Arc of the Testimony in which he played with noted drummer Tony Williams and the one-off project Pieces, with Brain. Two live albums by Praxis, called Transmutation Live and Live in Poland (featuring recordings from European concerts) were also issued. Death Cube K released an album that year called Disembodied. In 1998, Buckethead released Colma, an album dedicated to his mother, who at the time was suffering from colon cancer. The same year saw a compilation album by Praxis called Collection. In 1999, Buckethead released his fifth album, a collaboration with Les Claypool from the band Primus, titled Monsters and Robots — currently the best-selling album of his career. This album includes the song \\"The Ballad of Buckethead,\\" for which his first music video ever was made. Buckethead began three new projects that year, the first being the band Cornbugs, a collaboration with actor Bill Moseley, drummer Pinchface, and later keyboardist Travis Dickerson. Another project, Cobra Strike with an album called The 13th Scroll, featured Pinchface, Bryan \\"Brain\\" Mantia, DJ Disk, and Bill Laswell. Buckethead also began a collaboration with actor Viggo Mortensen, whom he first met through a recording project called Myth: Dreams of the World in 1996. Together they released One Man's Meat, One Less Thing to Worry About, and The Other Parade. Buckethead contributed to the 1999 album Devil Dub by the San Francisco Bay Area band Ben Wa consisting of \\"Dr. Ware\\" and \\"House\\"(Limbomaniacs, Tommy Guerrero, Buckethead's Giant Robot, MCM & the Monster). =2000–04: Guns N' Roses and other projects= Buckethead achieved a higher public profile as lead guitarist for Guns N' Roses from 2000 to 2004. He recorded the often-delayed album Chinese Democracy with the band and appeared live on stage in 2001 and 2002, including Rock in Rio 3, MTV's Video Music Awards, and parts of the Chinese Democracy Tour. Despite being a member of GN'R, Buckethead released his sixth studio album, called Somewhere Over the Slaughterhouse in 2001, and also his only EP, called KFC Skin Piles. He also released two albums with his band Cornbugs, and a third under his 'Death Cube K' pseudonym. In 2000, Buckethead released the second and last album by Cobra Strike, called Cobra Strike II - Y, Y+B, X+Y. He joined two new projects during this period. The first was the progressive rock band Thanatopsis (named after a poem by William Cullen Bryant) with Travis Dickerson and drummer Ramy Antoun; this group went on to release four albums. Some Thanatopsis material has also appeared on albums released by Buckethead and Dickerson. Buckethead's second side project during this period was with Bill Laswell and Japanese producer Shin Terai, released as the album Unison. In 2002, Buckethead released three studio albums: Funnel Weaver, a collection of 49 short tracks, Bermuda Triangle, and finally, Electric Tears, a calming album that is similar to his earlier release, Colma. When Laswell was not able to play with Praxis at the Bonnaroo Music and Arts festival, Les Claypool asked to jam with Brain, Bernie Worrell, and Buckethead, forming a new supergroup called Colonel Claypool's Bucket of Bernie Brains. The jamband experiment was successful enough to do some further live dates. Later, in 2003, marking the release of his tenth studio album, Buckethead released the sequel of his debut Bucketheadland, simply called Bucketheadland 2. Together with actor Viggo Mortensen, he did Pandemoniumfromamerica, and with Thanatopsis, its second release, called Axiology. Buckethead's relationship with Guns N' Roses was somewhat erratic in its last year, despite contractual obligations. According to an interview with Rose, he seemingly 'left' the band in January 2004 without telling anyone, and 'rejoined' in a similar manner in February. \\"His transient lifestyle has made it impossible for even his closest friends to have nearly any form of communication with him whatsoever.\\" In March 2004, Buckethead left Guns N' Roses. His manager cited Guns' inability to complete an album or tour. Since that time, his cult following in the underground music communities has steadily increased. He frequently performs at festivals and in clubs nationwide and often tours as the feature performer. The year 2004 saw the release of three new studio albums: Island of Lost Minds, which was his first tour-only album being later re-released by TDRS Music; Population Override, a blues-rock tour de force with Dickerson; and The Cuckoo Clocks of Hell, considered his heaviest effort to date. The latter includes \\"Spokes for the Wheel of Torment,\\" for which Syd Garon and Eric Henry made a music video based on the famous triptychs by Hieronymus Bosch. Buckethead also recorded the final two albums by the Cornbugs, Brain Circus and Donkey Town as well as another release with Viggo Mortensen called Please Tomorrow and a second with Shin Terai, titled Heaven & Hell. C2B3 also released their only album, The Big Eyeball in the Sky, and toured it in North America. In an interview with Revolver, Ozzy Osbourne stated that he had offered to have Buckethead play guitar in his band at Ozzfest, but changed his mind after meeting with him and realizing that he would not remove his costume: =2005–06: Buckethead & Friends= Buckethead and That 1 Guy, performing as The Frankenstein Brothers in 2006. In 2005, Buckethead released the album Enter the Chicken through Serj Tankian's record label, Serjical Strike. The album features Tankian himself, Maximum Bob (of the Deli Creeps), Death by Stereo singer Efrem Shulz, Bad Acid Trip and others.Leroy, Dan, Buckethead Knows Chicken, Rolling Stone, Oct 13, 2005. Retrieved January 6, 2009 It is marked by its leaning toward more traditional song structures while still featuring typical Buckethead guitar skills. \\"We Are One\\" was released as a single and also appeared on the soundtrack of Masters of Horror. \\"Three Fingers\\" was used for the soundtrack of the horror movie Saw II. The final track, \\"Nottingham Lace,\\" was first made public via his home page and soon became a concert staple and one of his most popular songs. Buckethead also released two further solo albums in 2005, Kaleidoscalp and Inbred Mountain—the latter being the first album as a solo artist released on the label TDRS Music. Both albums originally were sold exclusively at concerts and only later got an official release through the label's website. Buckethead released albums with other bands that year: with Cornbugs, he released two compilation albums, called Rest Home for Robots and Skeleton Farm. Gorgone's self titled album was released that year' itself based upon recording sessions from the album Population Override that Buckethead released in 2004. In 2006 the cross-console video game Guitar Hero II was launched, featuring Buckethead's song \\"Jordan\\" as an unlockable bonus track. Although the song has been performed live in the past, the video game version is the only known studio recording of the song. When playing it live, Buckethead would almost always simply perform the verse and chorus of \\"Jordan\\" before transitioning into the next song. However, the Guitar Hero II version contains a special solo created specifically for the game. Also the same year, Buckethead released two DVDs, titled Young Buckethead Vol. 1 and Young Buckethead Vol. 2, featuring rare footage from 1990 and 1991. The DVD also contains three complete Deli Creeps shows, a sound check, backstage footage, and solo footage of just Buckethead. He also released the albums The Elephant Man's Alarm Clock and Crime Slunk Scene, both sold on his tours but later sold on the TDRS Music website. The last album has the song \\"Soothsayer (Dedicated to Aunt Suzie)\\"; this song (along with \\"Jordan\\" and \\"Nottingham Lace\\") is one of his most popular songs and is often played live. Buckethead released his final compilation album with the band Cornbugs, called Celebrity Psychos. He also released an album with Travis Dickerson, called Chicken Noodles, a move that would see the start of a four-year long collaboration with the keyboardist. Buckethead's band Thanatopsis would also release Anatomize that year. =2007–10: Continued solo work and Michael Jackson tribute= The massive In Search of The box set, a set of 13 albums by Buckethead, along with each copy's cover being hand-drawn differently. In 2007, Buckethead released an unprecedented amount of new material. In February, a box set titled In Search of The, containing 13 albums of original material, was released. It was handcrafted, numbered, and monogrammed by Buckethead and contained over nine hours of music. A regular solo album, called Pepper's Ghost, was released in March. A disc of acoustic improvisations called Acoustic Shards was also released, becoming the twentieth studio album that the artist had released so far in his solo career. In midyear, he reissued his demo tape Bucketheadland Blueprints, with two alternative album covers: a special edition with a hand- drawn cover made by him, or a standard edition with the original cover art. In October, he released his final two albums of the year, called Decoding the Tomb of Bansheebot and Cyborg Slunks. The latter again came in both a hand- drawn limited edition and (some weeks later) as a normal CD. Buckethead wrote three songs dedicated to Aunt Suzie in 2006-07: the aforementioned “Soothsayer” (Crime Slunk Scene), “Aunt Suzie” (Cyborg Slunks), and “Sail On Soothsayer”, (Decoding The Tomb Of Bansheebot). As Death Cube K, Buckethead released two albums in 2007: an album called DCK, limited to 400 hand-numbered copies and released in August; and in December, the 5-CD box set Monolith, which consisted of one unbroken track per CD. During 2007, Buckethead also collaborated and appeared on numerous albums with other artists. The sequel to Chicken Noodles (a collaboration with Travis Dickerson), simply called Chicken Noodles II, was issued by TDRS in December. A live record by Praxis, titled Tennessee 2004; the third album with Shin Terai, called Lightyears; and another album with drummer Bryan Mantia, called Kevin's Noodle House, were also released through the year. That same year, it was revealed that Buckethead joined a project by the name of Science Faxtion, a band featuring bassist Bootsy Collins and drummer Bryan \\"Brain\\" Mantia, with Greg Hampton supplying lead vocals. Their first album, called Living on Another Frequency, was delayed several times and was finally released in November 2008. Wakarusa, 2008 On January 1, 2008, the band Praxis released the long-awaited album Profanation (Preparation for a Coming Darkness) in Japan. The album had actually been recorded in 2005, but had to be put on hold when the original label went bankrupt. That year Buckethead released From the Coop through the label Avabella (where he released Acoustic Shards), consisting of the demos Buckethead gave to Jas Obrecht back in 1988. This CD also included the first ever \\"official\\" biography of/by the artist. Later that same year, he announced the release of the album called Albino Slug (a tour-only CD until official release on December of the same year). Along with this album, he appeared on the album The Dragons of Eden, with Dickerson and Mantia, and in collaboration with That 1 Guy as the Frankenstein Brothers, an album called Bolt on Neck was released. That 1 Guy and Buckethead toured together through fall 2008, playing songs from this album. Buckethead also appeared in the documentary American Music: Off the Record, in which he appears only playing. Serj Tankian's label, Serjical Strike, reissued the album Enter the Chicken with an extra song. Furthermore, Buckethead contributed to one track of actor Viggo Mortensen's album At All, and with Travis Dickerson and filmmaker Alix Lambert on the album Running After Deer. Buckethead appeared with Bootsy Collins in Cincinnati, Ohio, to promote the vote for the 2008 United States presidential election for the organization Rock the Vote. He also joined Collins on Fallen Soldiers Memorial, an album with proceeds going to the National Fallen Heroes Foundation. More than four years after his departure from the band Guns N' Roses, Chinese Democracy was made available. Buckethead appears on all but two songs and was given writing credits on \\"Shackler's Revenge\\" (which appeared in the popular video game Rock Band 2); \\"Scraped\\"; and \\"Sorry,\\" which features guest singer Sebastian Bach. The album features eleven of Buckethead's guitar solos. On December 30, 2008, Buckethead released two new tracks via his website to honor the 24th birthday of basketball player LeBron James. These tracks were later made available on the album, Slaughterhouse on the Prairie, which was released a month later through TDRS Music. In 2009 he released the albums A Real Diamond in the Rough, and Forensic Follies, which was first sold at some of his tour dates but later released on TDRS. That year he also released the track The Homing Beacon, a tribute to Michael Jackson, who had been an early influence on him. The song was later included on his 2012 album Electric Sea. On February 5, 2010, Buckethead released an album called Shadows Between the Sky and later that month, Gibson released the Buckethead Signature Les Paul guitar. On April 29, 2010, Buckethead's website was updated with a picture with the message \\"Greetings from Bucketheadland... Buckethead wants you to know he appreciates your support all these years, it means so much to him. Buckethead is having some animatronic parts replaced, Slip Disc snuck into the park and caused some mayhem.\\" The mention of Slip Disc is a reference to a Bucketheadland nemesis found on the Bucketheadland album. Bootsy Collins continued to update his Twitter Web site about Buckethead's condition, stating that he had recently gone into therapy for a few months. Nevertheless, after return from injury, on July 15, 2010, Buckethead, along with Brain and Melissa Reese, has released the first volume out of three 5-CD box sets called Best Regards. On August 25, 2010, Buckethead announced his 28th studio album titled Spinal Clock, which showcases his banjo skills. In October, two albums in collaboration with Brain were released, the first called Brain as Hamenoodle, and the second installment of the \\"Regards\\" series with Brain and Melissa Reese called, Kind Regards. Eventually, both projects were released on October 13. That month also saw a new solo album titled Captain EO's Voyage first available only on iTunes. It was later announced that a physical edition will be released on December 1. This, along with Buckethead's final Travis Dickerson album were released on November 29. In May 2010, Buckethead started to release albums under the concept of a kiosk within Buckethead's fictional \\"abusement\\" park called \\"Buckethead Pikes\\". The albums released within this concept were to resemble a comic book style and be shorter in length than his previous works at around half an hour in length. =2011–15: Focus on solo Pikes= Buckethead live in Syracuse, 2011 Buckethead left Praxis in 2011, the Frankenstein Brothers in 2012, and Brain in 2013. He contributed to two tracks on Lawson Rollins's album Elevation in 2011. He also departed from his live touring schedule, with his final performance taking place on December 31, 2012. During his absence from touring and other projects, Buckethead's solo release schedule increased speed dramatically- reaching a peak in 2015 with 118 albums, around one every three days on average. Notably, the cover of Pike 13 contains a photograph of Buckethead unmasked; the first such image released to the public. The cover of Pike 13 does not feature the common elements of the Pikes series, and is simply a photograph of Buckethead during his teenage years, carrying an acoustic guitar and hugging his father. Buckethead continued to release albums throughout the year, breaking the numerical order occasionally (for example, Pike 34 Pikes was released three weeks after Pike 35 Thank you Ohlinger's). The final album of the year Wishes was released on December 24, free of charge for a limited time. During 2014, Buckethead continued releasing albums at an even faster pace. Sixty albums were released throughout the year, averaging one album every six days. The sixty-fifth installment, Hold Me Forever (In memory of my mom Nancy York Carroll), honored Buckethead's mother, who had recently died. The final release of the year, Pike 101 In the Hollow Hills, took place on December 31. Buckethead's release schedule increased in speed again, almost doubling his output during 2015. The 150th release in the series and 180th overall, Heaven is your Home (For my Father, Thomas Manley Carroll), was released free on June 21 (Father's Day) and in dedication to his late father. On October 1, Buckethead started The Silver Shamrock Series, a Halloween-themed series in which the guitarist released one dark ambient album per day. Starting with Pike 176, 31 Days Til Halloween: Visitor From The Mirror, each subsequent album continued the countdown to Halloween's eve culminating with Pike 206, Happy Halloween: Silver Shamrock. Buckethead's next release, 365 Days Til Halloween: Smash (released on November 1) referenced the countdown, but is not considered part of series. A physical edition of the series was released in October 2017 on a pumpkin-themed USB key that contains all 31 albums on it. The last album of the year was Pike 219, \\"Rain Drops on Christmas\\". The album originally released as a free digital download on December 24 (Christmas Eve), included a dedication \\"to those who lost loved ones\\" in the title track. =2016–present: Continued Pikes, return to touring, and reissues= kill switch on his guitar during his show at the Granada in Lawrence, Kansas on April 15, 2016. Throughout 2016, Buckethead's release output declined sharply, with only 24 albums being released. Pike 226, \\"Happy Birthday MJ 23\\" was released on the 53rd birthday of basketball player Michael Jordan. 2016 also saw Buckethead return to touring, after a four-year absence. 2017 saw a slight increase in pace compared to the previous year, with 30 albums being released in total. In addition, Buckethead began to repress part of his older catalogue in vinyl format, the first time in over a decade that his albums have been pressed in a physical format other than CD. Inbred Mountain, The Elephant Man's Alarm Clock, Crime Slunk Scene, Decoding the Tomb of Bansheebot, Albino Slug, Slaughterhouse on the Prairie, A Real Diamond in the Rough, and Shadows Between the Sky have all been announced so far. Several reissues come in a variety of different packages, unique to each release. Some of these included signed copies, limited-edition posters or photographs, personalized recordings, among other things. As part of these reissues, the albums Albino Slug and Decoding the Tombs of Bansheebot underwent major changes with songs being re-recorded, and their album cover and title changed as well. Pike 241 \\"Sparks in the Dark\\" has also been announced on vinyl. Also announced was the release of \\"Bucketheadland 5-13 10-31\\", an entirely new album to be released on Halloween exclusively on vinyl. It is the first album since 2012's Electric Sea not to be a part of the Pike series. In addition, Bootsy Collins announced he is working with Buckethead once again on a collaborative album set to be released in the year. In August 2017, Buckethead announced his fall US tour to take place in September and October. Buckethead played with a live band consisting of Bryan \\"Brain\\" Mantia on drums and Dan Monti on bass during the tour, departing from his traditional touring routine in which Buckethead was the only performer on stage. Shortly after the tour announcement, Buckethead also announced the release of \\"Live from Bucketheadland\\", his first live album, was released on vinyl in January 2018. Buckethead's tour continued in 2018, reverting to a solo show.Buckethead 2018 Buckethead also toured in 2019 across the United States. Influences Buckethead wearing a Michael Jordan jersey, a major influence on his songs. Buckethead cites a wide variety of musical influences, including Michael Jackson, Parliament-Funkadelic, Shawn Lane, Michael Schenker, Uli Jon Roth, Paul Gilbert, Yngwie Malmsteen, Joe Satriani, Eddie Hazel, Randy Rhoads, Larry LaLonde, Mike Patton, James Cutri, Louis Johnson, Jimi Hendrix, Jennifer Batten, The Residents, Eddie Van Halen and Angus Young, as well as the many artists he has collaborated with over the years. In addition to his musical influences, Buckethead cites a diverse range of non-musical influences manifested on several ways out of which dedicated songs to said inspirations have been a staple of Buckethead's discography with particular attention to basketball players like Michael Jordan (songs \\"Jordan\\" and \\"Jump Man\\", album \\"Happy Birthday MJ 23\\"), George Gervin (on \\"Iceman\\"), Blake Griffin (on \\"Crack the Sky\\" and \\"Griffin's Spike\\"), \\"Pistol\\" Pete Maravich (on \\"The Mark of Davis\\"), LeBron James (with four songs dedicated to him), and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (album \\"Kareem's Footprint\\"). Other influences include martial artist and actor Bruce Lee (on \\"The Game of Death\\" song and inspiration behind the use of nunchakus on stage), author H. P. Lovecraft (on the \\"Lurker at the Threshold\\" suite, and his 55th Pike, The Miskatonic Scale), numerous science fiction and horror TV shows and movies including Little House on the Prairie, Alejandro Jodorowsky's The Holy Mountain (on Kaleidoscalp), and Giant Robot (mentioned on several songs, albums, and episodes shown on stage). Disney and Disneyland are also major influences on Buckethead's career. Buckethead is also inspired by Japanese filmmaker Takashi Miike, to whom a song on Pepper's Ghost is dedicated. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre franchise of movies is also a big inspiration to him and he has written many songs such as Jowls, which are heavily inspired by those movies. The song \\"To Infinity and Beyond\\" from Out Orbit was dedicated to then-recently deceased basketball reporter Craig Sager.Buckethead pikes: to infinity and beyond Equipment=Guitars= * Gibson Buckethead Signature Les Paul * Jackson Buckethead Signature Roundhorn V * Gibson SST * Gibson 1969 Les Paul Custom * Custom built Jackson Doubleneck * ESP MII * Heartfield Talon II * Steinberger GS (Kaiser's Gift) * Ibanez Rocket Roll II =Effects= * BOSS NS-2 Noise Suppressor * Electro-Harmonix Micro Synthesizer * MXR Phase 90 * Line6 FM4 * Boss FZ-2 Hyper Fuzz * DigiTech Bass Synth Wah * Alesis Midiverb II * DigiTech Whammy 4 * Dunlop Crybaby GCB95 * VOX V847 =Amplifiers= * Mesa Boogie Triple Rectifier head * Mesa Stiletto Trident head * ENGL Powerball head * Marshall JVM410H head * Bogner Uberschall head * Peavey 5150 head * EVH 5150 III 50 watt head * Matt Wells 17½-watt head wired through a Harry Kolbe 4x12 cab * Rockman XP-100 =Headwear= * Fourteen-piece Kentucky Fried Chicken Bargain Bucket Buckethead's bands and projects Dan Monti, Bryan Mantia, and Buckethead in 2017. * Solo career (1987–present) * with Class-X (1987–1988) * with Limbomaniacs (1990) * with Deli Creeps (1990–2007) * with Praxis (1992–2011) * with Zillatron (1993) * as Death Cube K (1994–1999, 2007–2009) * with Jonas Hellborg and Michael Shrieve (1995) * with Cornbugs (1995–2007) * with Giant Robot & Giant Robot II (1996–1998, 2004–2006) * with DJ Disk (1996–2001) * with Brain (1997–2013) * with El Stew (1999) * with Cobra Strike (1999–2000) * with Shin Terai (1999–2007) * with Viggo Mortensen (1999, 2003–2005, 2008–2013) * with Guns N' Roses (2000–2004) * with Thanatopsis (2001–2006, 2016) * with Colonel Claypool's Bucket of Bernie Brains (2002–2004) * with Travis Dickerson (2004–2010) * as The Frankenstein Brothers (with That 1 Guy) (2006–2012) * with Science Faxtion (2007–2008) * with Lawson Rollins (2011) * with Brewer and Brain (2017) Discography Buckethead has released 31 regular solo albums, as well as 283 albums in the \\"Pikes Series\\", for 314 albums overall. ;Main Studio albums *Bucketheadland (1992) *Giant Robot (1994) *The Day of the Robot (1996) *Colma (1998) *Monsters and Robots (1999) *Somewhere Over the Slaughterhouse (2001) *Funnel Weaver (2002) *Bermuda Triangle (2002) *Electric Tears (2002) *Bucketheadland 2 (2003) *Island of Lost Minds (2004) *Population Override (2004) *The Cuckoo Clocks of Hell (2004) *Enter the Chicken (2005) *Kaleidoscalp (2005) *Inbred Mountain (2005) *The Elephant Man's Alarm Clock (2006) *Crime Slunk Scene (2006) *Pepper's Ghost (2007) *Decoding the Tomb of Bansheebot (2007) *Cyborg Slunks (2007) *Albino Slug (2008) *Slaughterhouse on the Prairie (2009) *A Real Diamond in the Rough (2009) *Forensic Follies (2009) *Needle in a Slunk Stack (2009) *Shadows Between the Sky (2010) *Spinal Clock (2010) *Captain EO's Voyage (2010) *Electric Sea (2012) *Bucketheadland 5-13 10 31 (2017) ;Pike Series Buckethead Pikes are mini-albums, with 283 of them released since 2011.

Cully proved an audience favorite and was scripted frequently into adventures with Timmy. Producers felt two adult males on the show would overwhelm the audience however and cut back Hugh Reilly's appearances as Timmy's father Paul Martin. Paul was sent to distant fields or away from home on business. The Cully character was used to make positive statements about aging Americans. In one episode, for example, Paul ably defends Cully when neighbors want to put the \\"crazy old animal lover\\" into a home. In Cully's last appearance of 1964, Cully becomes Lassie's guardian when the Martin family moves to Australia to teach agriculture. Cully suffers a debilitating heart attack however and Lassie is provided a home with Corey Stuart, a Forest Ranger. Cully disappeared from the series and was never referenced again.Collins, Ace.

Biography  Hristo Makedonski was born in 1835 in the village of Gorni Todorak in the region of Macedonia (today Ano Theodoraki in the Kroussa municipal unit, Kilkis regional unit, Greece), at that time part of the Ottoman Empire. He studied at the Greek school in his village and has been engaged with trade. After permanent Turkish repressions he became haiduk in the band of Stoimen voivode acting in Maleshevo. In 1862 he joined the First Bulgarian Legion of Georgi Rakovski in Belgrade and fought with the Turks in Belgrade. After the dissolution of the legion he arrived in Romania. In 1864-1865 he led a small detachment, with which on the order of Rakovski made the round of western Bulgarian lands. Later, in the period 1867-1868 Makedonski took part in the Second Bulgarian Legion and after its disbanding in the spring of 1868, passed in Romania. In the same year he joined the band of Hadji Dimitar and Stefan Karadja. After the defeat of the band he escaped in Odessa and then again transferred to Romania.

The terms in India have replaced earlier geographical terms, such as pergunnah and thana. In Andra Pradesh and Telangana, a newer unit called mandal (circle) has come to replace the system of tehsils. It is generally smaller than a tehsil, and is meant for facilitating local self-government in the panchayat system. In West Bengal, community development blocks are the empowered grassroots administrative unit, replacing tehsils. As an entity of local government, the tehsil office (panchayat samiti) exercises certain fiscal and administrative power over the villages and municipalities within its jurisdiction. It is the ultimate executive agency for land records and related administrative matters. The chief official is called the tehsildar or, less officially, the talukdar or taluka muktiarkar. Taluk or tehsil can be considered sub-districts in the Indian context. In some instances, tehsils overlap with \\"blocks\\" (panchayat union blocks or panchayat development blocks) and come under the land and revenue department, headed by tehsildar; and blocks come under the rural development department, headed by the block development officer and serve different government administrative functions over the same or similar geographical area. Although they may on occasion share the same area with a subdivision of a revenue division, known as revenue blocks, the two are distinct. For example, Raipur district in Chhattisgarh state is administratively divided into 13 tehsils and 15 revenue blocks. Nevertheless, the two are often conflated. Background India, as a vast country, is subdivided into many states and union territories for administrative purposes. Further divisions of these states are known as districts. These districts (jilla/zilla) are again divided into many subdivisions, viz tehsils or talukas. These subdivisions are again divided into gram panchayats or village panchayaths. Initially, this was done for collecting land revenue and administration purposes. But now these subdivisions are governed in tandem with other departments of government like education, agriculture, irrigation, health, police, etc. The different departments of state government generally have offices at tehsil or taluka level to facilitate good governance and to provide facilities to common people easily. Nomenclature In India, the term tehsil is commonly used in all northern states. In Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, taluka or taluk is more common. In Eastern India, instead of tehsils, the term Subdivisions are used in Bihar, Assam and Jharkhand, as well as large parts of Northeast India. Tehsil/tahsil and taluka/taluk and the variants are used as English words without further translation. Since these terms are unfamiliar to English speakers outside the subcontinent, the word county has sometimes been provided as a gloss, on the basis that a tehsil, like a county, is an administrative unit hierarchically above the local city, town, or village, but subordinate to a larger state or province. India and Pakistan have an intermediate level of hierarchy (or more than one, at least in parts of India): the district, also sometimes translated as county. In neither case is the analogy very exact. Organization setup Tehsildar is the chief or key government officer of each tehsil or taluka.https://www.nextgurukul.in/wiki/concept/tamilnadu/class-6/civics/the- local-government/rural-administration/3959574 In some states different nomenclature like talukdar, mamledar, amaldar, mandal officer is used. In many states of India, the tehsildar works as a magistrate. Each taluka will have an office called taluka office or tehsil office or tehsildar office at a designated place within taluka area known as taluka headquarters. Tehsildar is the incharge of taluka office. This is similar to district office or district collector at district level. Throughout India, there is a three-tier local body/Panchayati Raj system within the state. At the top is the jilla/zilla panchayat (parishad). Taluka/Mandal Panchayat/Community Development Block is the second layer of this system and below them are the gram panchayats or village panchayats. These panchayats at all the three levels have elected members from eligible voters of particular subdivision. These elected members form the bodies which help the administration in policy making, development works and bringing grievances of the common public to the notice of administration. Nayabat is lower part of tehsil which have some powers like tehsil. It can be understood as tehsil is the sub district of a district, similarly Nayabat is the sub tehsil of a tehsil.

It is one of the largest known stars and one of the most luminous and massive red supergiants, with a radius over 1,500 times that of the Sun () and a luminosity varying from 300,000 to 600,000 times the solar luminosity (). WOH G64 is surrounded by an optically thick dust envelope of roughly a light year in diameter containing 3 to 9 times the Sun's mass of expelled material that was created by the strong stellar wind. If placed at the center of the Solar System, the star's surface would engulf the orbit of Jupiter. Discovery WOH G64 was discovered in the 1970s by Bengt Westerlund, Olander and Hedin. Like NML Cygni, the \\"WOH\\" in the star's name comes from the names of its three discoverers, but in this case refers to a whole catalogue of giant and supergiant stars in the LMC. Westerlund also discovered another notable red supergiant star, Westerlund 1-26, found in the massive super star cluster Westerlund 1 in the constellation Ara. In 1986, infrared observations showed that it was a highly luminous supergiant surrounded by gas and dust which absorbed around three quarters of its radiation. In 2007, observers using the Very Large Telescope (VLT) showed that WOH G64 is surrounded by a torus-shaped cloud. WOH G64 was also discovered to be a prominent source of OH, , and masers emission, which is typical of an OH/IR supergiant star. It shows an unusual spectrum of nebular emission; the hot gas is rich in nitrogen and has a radial velocity considerably more positive than that of the star. Distance The distance of WOH G64 is assumed to be around away from Earth, since it appears to be in the LMC. The Gaia Data Release 2 parallax for WOH G64 is – and the negative parallax does not provide a reliable distance. Variability WOH G64 varies regularly in brightness by over a magnitude at visual wavelengths with a primary period of around 800 days. The star suffers from over six magnitudes of extinction at visual wavelengths, and the variation at infra-red wavelengths is much smaller. It has been described as a carbon-rich Mira or long-period variable, which would necessarily be an asymptotic-giant-branch star (AGB star) rather than a supergiant. Brightness variability has been confirmed by other researchers in some spectral bands, but it is unclear what the actual variable type is. No significant spectral variation has been found. Physical properties Artist's impression of the dusty torus around WOH G64 (European Southern Observatory) The spectral type of WOH G64 is given as M5, but it is usually found to have a much cooler spectral type of M7.5, highly unusual for a supergiant star. WOH G64 is classified as an extremely luminous M class supergiant and is likely to be the largest star and the most luminous and coolest red supergiant in the LMC. The combination of the star's temperature and luminosity places it toward the upper right corner of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram. The star's evolved state means that it can no longer hold on to its atmosphere due to low density, high radiation pressure, and the relatively opaque products of thermonuclear fusion. It has an average mass loss rate of 3.1 to per year, among the highest known and unusually high even for a red supergiant. The parameters of WOH G64 are uncertain. The star was originally calculated to be around between based on spectroscopic measurements assuming spherical shells, suggesting initial masses at least and consequently larger values for the radius between . 2007 measurements using the Very Large Telescope (VLT) gave the star a bolometric luminosity of , suggesting an initial mass of , and a radius around based on the assumption of an effective temperature of and radiative transfer modelling of the surrounding torus. In 2009, Levesque calculated an effective temperature of by spectral fitting of the optical and near-UV SED. Adopting the Ohnaka luminosity with this new temperature gives a radius of but with a margin of error of 5% or . Ignoring the effect of the dusty torus in redirecting infrared radiation, estimates of based on a luminosity of and an effective temperature of 3,372 - have also been derived. Those physical parameters are consistent with the largest galactic red supergiants and hypergiants found elsewhere such as Westerlund 1-26, VY Canis Majoris and NML Cygni and with theoretical models of the coolest, most luminous and largest possible cool supergiants (e.g. the Hayashi limit or the Humphreys–Davidson limit). A 2018 paper gives a luminosity of and an effective temperature of , based on optical and infrared photometry and assuming spherically-symmetric radiation from the surrounding dust. This suggests a radius of about . Possible companion WOH G64 has a possible late O-type dwarf companion of a bolometric magnitude of −7.5 or a luminosity of , which would make WOH G64 a binary star although there has been no confirmation of this observation and the intervening dust clouds makes the study of the star very difficult.

It is one of the largest known stars by radius, and is also one of the most luminous and massive red supergiants, as well as one of the most luminous stars in the Milky Way. VY CMa is a single star with a large infrared (IR) excess, making it one of the brightest objects in the sky at wavelengths of between 5 and 20 microns (µm) and indicating a dust shell or disk heated by the star. It is about times the mass of the Sun (). It is also surrounded by a complex asymmetric circumstellar envelope (CSE) caused by mass loss from the star itself. It produces strong molecular maser emission and was one of the first radio masers discovered. VY CMa is embedded within the large molecular cloud Sh2-310, one of the largest star-forming H II regions with a diameter of 480 arcminutes (') or . The radius of VY CMa is about 1,420 times that of the Sun (), which is close to the Hayashi limit and corresponds to a volume about 3 billion times bigger than the Sun. A hypothetical object travelling at the speed of light would take 6 hours to travel around the star's circumference, compared to 14.5 seconds for the Sun. If placed at the center of the Solar System, VY CMa's surface would extend beyond the orbit of Jupiter, although there is still considerable variation in estimates of the radius, with some making it larger than the orbit of Saturn. Observational history Portrait in bust of Jérôme Lalande in 1802 The first known recorded observation of VY Canis Majoris is in the star catalogue of the French astronomer Jérôme Lalande, on 7 March 1801, which lists it as a 7th magnitude star. Further 19th- and 20th-century studies of its apparent magnitude suggested that the star had been fading since 1850. Since 1847, VY Canis Majoris has been described as a crimson star. During the 19th century, observers measured at least six discrete components, suggesting that it might be a multiple star. These discrete components are now known to be bright areas in the surrounding nebula. Visual observations in 1957 and high-resolution imaging in 1998 showed that there are no companion stars. VY CMa was also discovered to be a strong source of OH (1612 MHz), (22235.08 MHz), and (43122 MHz) masers emission, which is typical of an OH/IR star. Many molecules, such as , , , , , , , and , have also been detected. The variation in VY CMa's brightness was first described in 1931 when it was listed (in German) as a long-period variable with a photographic magnitude range of 9.5 to 11.5. It was given the variable star designation VY Canis Majoris in 1939, the 43rd variable star of the constellation Canis Major. Surroundings WFPC2/HST image showing the asymmetric nebula surrounding VY CMa, which is the central star VY Canis Majoris is surrounded by an extensive and dense asymmetric red reflection nebula with a total ejected mass of and a temperature of 800 K based on a DUSTY model atmosphere that has been formed by material expelled from its central star. The diameter of the inner shell is found to be 0\\".12, corresponding to at a distance of 1.2 kpc, whereas that of the outer one is 10\\", corresponding to . This nebula is so bright that it was discovered in 1917 with an 18 cm telescope, and also contains condensations that were once regarded as companion stars. It has been extensively studied with the aid of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), showing that the nebula has a complex structure that includes filaments and arcs, which were caused by past eruptions; this structure is similar to that of the nebula surrounding the post-red supergiant (Post-RSG) or yellow hypergiant (YHG) IRC +10420. The similarity has led astronomers to propose that VY CMa will evolve blueward on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram (HR diagram) to become a yellow hypergiant, then a Luminous blue variable (LBV), and finally a Wolf–Rayet star (WR star). Map of the giant molecular cloud Sharpless 310 and its surroundings Observations combining Hubble Space Telescope data with that obtained from the Keck Telescope, located in Hawaii, it was possible to make a three-dimensional reconstruction of the material surrounding VY CMa. This reconstruction showed that VY CMa's mass loss is much more complex than expected for any red supergiant or hypergiant. It became clear that the bows and nodules appeared at different times; the jets are randomly oriented, which leads us to believe that they derive from explosions occurred in active regions of the stellar photosphere. The spectroscopic data showed that the jets move away from the star at different speeds, indicating that they occurred at different times and originate from different areas of the surface of VY CMa. Multiple asymmetric mass loss events and also the ejection of the outermost material are deduced to have occurred within the last 500–1,000 years, while that of a knot near the star would be less than 100 years. The mass loss is due to strong convection in the tenuous outer layers of the star, associated with magnetic fields. This is similar to the sunspots and coronal ejections of the Sun but on a much larger scale. Distance Combined optical and infrared image of VY CMa. The bright star at the upper right is τ Canis Majoris. (ESO/Digitized Sky Survey 2) VLBA used to derive VY CMa's 2011 distance estimate In 1976, Charles J. Lada and Mark J. Reid published observations of the bright-rimmed molecular cloud Sh2-310, which is 15' east of VY Canis Majoris. At the edge of the cloud bordered by the bright rim, an abrupt decrease in the CO emission and an increase in brightness of the emission were observed, indicating possible destruction of molecular material and enhanced heating at the cloud-rim interface, respectively. Lada and Reid assumed the distance of Sh2-310 is approximately equal to that of the stars, which are members of the open cluster NGC 2362, that ionize the rim. NGC 2362 has a distance of (kpc) or roughly (ly) as determined from its color-magnitude diagram. VY CMa is projected onto the tip of the cloud rim, suggesting its association with Sh2-310. In addition to that, the velocity of Sh2-310 is very close to the velocity of the star. This further indicates the association of the star with Sh2-310, and consequently with NGC 2362, which means VY Canis Majoris is at the same distance. A more recent measurement of the distance to NGC 2362 gives 1.2 kpc or about 3,910 ly. Stellar distances can be calculated by measuring parallaxes as Earth orbits around the Sun. However, VY Canis Majoris has a small parallax due to its great distance, and standard visual observations have a margin of error too large for a hypergiant star with an extended CSE to be useful, for example, the Hipparcos Catalogue (1997) gives a parallax of (mas), yielding a distance of (). The parallax of VY CMa can be precisely measured with high accuracy from the observation of masers using a long baseline interferometry. In 2008, observations of masers using VERA interferometry from the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan give a parallax of , corresponding to a distance of (about ). In 2012, observations of masers using Very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) from Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) independently derived a parallax of , corresponding to a distance of (about ). These new distance estimates imply that either Sh2-310 is less remote than usually estimated or that VY CMa is a foreground object. The Gaia mission should provide visual parallaxes with sufficient accuracy to constrain the distance to VY CMa, but the data release 2 value of is not meaningful. Variability VY Canis Majoris is a variable star that varies from an apparent visual magnitude of 9.6 at minimum brightness to a magnitude of 6.5 at maximum brightness with an estimated pulsational period of 956 days. In the General Catalogue of Variable Stars (GCVS) it is classed a semiregular variable of sub-type SRc, indicating a cool supergiant, although it is classed as a type LC slow irregular variable star in the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO) Variable Star Index. Other periods of 1,600 and 2,200 days have been derived. VY CMa is sometimes considered as the prototype for a class of heavily mass-losing OH/IR supergiants, distinct from the more common asymptotic giant branch OH/IR stars. Spectrum The spectrum of VY Canis Majoris is that of a high luminosity M class star. The hydrogen lines, however, have P Cygni profiles fit for luminous blue variables. The spectrum is dominated by TiO bands whose strengths suggest a classification of M5. The H-alpha (Hα) line is not visible yet and there are unusual emission lines of neutral elements such as sodium and calcium. The luminosity class as determined from different spectral features varies from bright giant (II) to bright supergiant (Ia), with a compromise being given as M5eIbp. Early attempts at classification were confused by the interpretation of surrounding nebulosity as companion stars. The derived spectral class varies depending on the features examined. The spectral features also vary noticeably over time. It is considered to be unambiguously cooler, and thus redder, than M2, and is usually classified between M3 and M5. Classes as extreme as M2.5 and M5 have been given. The luminosity class is likewise confused and often given only as I, partly because luminosity classes are poorly defined in the red and infrared portions of the spectrum. One study though, gives a luminosity class of Ia+ which means a hypergiant or extremely luminous supergiant. Physical properties Earth's orbit. rightthumbupright=1.4(July 2008, outdated).

A very large and luminous star, VY CMa is among the most extreme stars in the Milky Way and has an effective temperature below . It occupies the upper-right hand corner of the HR diagram although its exact luminosity and temperature are uncertain. Most of the properties of the star depend directly on its distance. =Luminosity= The bolometric luminosity (Lbol) of VY CMa can be calculated from Spectral energy distribution (SED) or bolometric flux, which can be determined from photometry in several visible and infrared bands. Earlier calculations of the luminosity based on an assumed distance of 1.5 kpc gave luminosities between 200,000 and 560,000 times the Sun's luminosity (). This is considerably very close or beyond the empirical Humphreys–Davidson limit. One study gave nearly at a distance of . In 2006 a luminosity of was calculated by integrating the total fluxes over the entire nebula, since most of the radiation coming from the star is reprocessed by the dust in the surrounding cloud. More recent estimates of the luminosity extrapolate values below based on distances below 1.2 kpc. Most of the output of VY CMa is emitted as infrared radiation, with a maximum emission at 5–10 μm, which is in part caused by reprocessing of the radiation by the circumstellar nebula. Many older luminosity estimates are consistent with current ones if they are re- scaled to the distance of 1.2 kpc. Despite being one of the most luminous stars in the Milky Way, much of the visible light of VY CMa is absorbed by the circumstellar envelope, so it cannot be seen with the naked eye and needs a telescope to be observed. It would be a naked eye star if no light was absorbed. =Mass= Since VY CMa has no companion star, its mass cannot be measured directly through gravitational interactions. Comparison of the effective temperature and bolometric luminosity of VY CMa compared to evolutionary tracks for massive stars suggest an initial mass of for a rotating star with a current mass of , or for a non-rotating star with a current mass of , and an age of 8.2 million years (Myr). Older studies have found much higher initial masses (thus also higher current masses) or a progenitor mass of based on old luminosity estimates. =Mass loss= Image taken by the ESO's Very Large Telescope showing the asymmetric nebula around VY CMa using SPHERE instrument. The star itself is hidden behind a dark disk. Crosses are artifacts due to the characteristics of the instrument. VY CMa has a strong stellar wind and is losing a lot of material due to its high luminosity and relatively low surface gravity. It has an average mass loss rate of per year, among the highest known and unusually high even for a red supergiant, as evidenced by the extensive circumstellar envelope. It is consequently one of the most important stars for understanding the high-mass loss episodes near the end of massive star evolution. The mass loss rate probably exceeded /yr during the most violent mass loss events. =Temperature= The effective temperature of VY CMa is uncertain but as the spectrum of VY CMa varies, then also the temperature may vary. Early estimates of the temperature of VY CMa assumed values below 3,000 K based on a spectral class of M5. In 2006, its temperature was calculated to be as high as , corresponding to a spectral class of M2.5, although VY CMa is usually considered as an M4-M5 star. Adopting the spectral class of M4-M5 with the temperature scale proposed by Emily Levesque gives a range of between 3,450 and 3,535 K. =Size= Right to left: VY Canis Majoris compared to Betelgeuse, Rho Cassiopeiae, the Pistol Star, and the Sun (too small to be visible in this thumbnail). The orbits of Jupiter and Neptune are also shown. The calculation of the radius of VY CMa is complicated by the extensive circumstellar envelope of the star. VY CMa is also a pulsating star, so its size changes with time. Earlier direct measurements of the radius at infrared (K-band = 2.2 µm) wavelength gave an angular diameter of , corresponding to radii above at an assumed distance of 1.5 kpc, considerably larger than expected for any red supergiant or red hypergiant. However, this is probably larger than the actual size of the underlying star and the angular diameter estimate appears exceedingly large due to interference by the circumstellar envelope. In 2006–2007 radii of have been derived from the estimated luminosity of and temperatures of 3,200–3,535 K. On 6 and 7 March 2011, VY CMa was observed at near-infrared wavelengths using interferometry at the Very Large Telescope. The size of the star was calculated using the Rosseland Radius, the location at which the optical depth is , with two modern distances of and . Its angular diameter was directly measured at , which corresponds to a radius of at a distance of . The high spectral resolution of these observations allowed the effects of contamination by circumstellar layers to be minimised. An effective temperature of , corresponding to a spectral class of M4, was then derived from the radius and a luminosity of which is based on the distance and a measured flux of . Most radius estimates of the VY CMa are considered as the size for the optical photosphere while the size of the star for the radio photosphere is calculated to be twice that of the size of the star for the optical photosphere. Despite the mass and very large size (though some estimates give smaller sizes), VY CMa has an average density of 5.33 to 8.38 mg/m3 (0.00000533 to 0.00000838 kg/m3), it is over 100,000 times less dense than Earth's atmosphere at sea level (1.2 kg/m3). Largest star VY Canis Majoris (brightest star in the image) and its surrounding molecular cloud complex (Rutherfurd Observatory/Columbia University) VY Canis Majoris has been known to be an extreme object since the middle of the 20th century, although its true nature was uncertain. In the late 20th century, it was accepted that it was a post-main sequence red supergiant. Its angular diameter had been measured and found to be significantly different depending on the observed wavelength. The first meaningful estimates of its properties showed a very large star, well in excess of . In contrast to prevailing opinion, a 2006 study, ignoring the effects of the circumstellar envelope in the observed flux of the star, derived a luminosity of , suggesting an initial mass of and radius of based on an assumed effective temperature of 3,650 K and distance of . On this basis they considered VY CMa and another notable extreme cool hypergiant star, NML Cygni, as normal early-type red supergiants. They assert that earlier very high luminosities of and very large radii of (or even ) were based on effective temperatures below 3,000 K that were unreasonably low. Almost immediately another paper published a size estimate of and concluded that VY CMa is a true hypergiant. This was based on the most recent temperature calibrations, giving an effective temperature of 3,450–3,535 K, and a luminosity of based on SED integration and a distance of . Since then, the size of VY CMa has been calculated more accurately to be somewhat lower, for example , while larger sizes have been published for a number of other galactic and extragalactic red supergiants (and hypergiants) such as Westerlund 1-26, WOH G64, and Stephenson 2-18. However, VY Canis Majoris is described as having the largest radius of well-characterised stars. Another recent estimate based on the Wittkowski radius and the Monnier radius derived an average size of . Evolution VY Canis Majoris is a highly evolved star with an age less than 10 Myr although some older authors argued that it would rather either be a very young protostar or a massive pre-main-sequence star with an age of only 1 Myr and also a circumstellar disk around the star. It has probably evolved from an O9 main sequence star with a radius of . The star has evolved rapidly because of its high mass. The time spent to the red hypergiant phase is estimated to be between 100,000 and 500,000 years, and thus VY CMa had left its main sequence more than a million years ago. The future evolution of VY CMa is uncertain, but like the most cool supergiants, the star will certainly explode as a supernova. It has begun to fuse helium into carbon, whereas a main sequence star fuses hydrogen into helium. Like Betelgeuse, it is losing mass at a high rate as it uses up its nuclear fuel, and is expected to explode as a supernova within the next 100,000 years, although it will probably evolve to a higher temperature beforehand. VY CMa has been discovered to be very unstable, having a prodigious mass loss rate. In this case, the CO emission is coincident with the bright KI shell in its asymmetric nebula. VY CMa will produce a moderately luminous and long-lasting type IIn supernova (SN IIn), or even a hypernova or superluminous supernova (SLSN) comparable to SN 1988Z (or possibly a type Ib supernova), but it is unlikely that the supernova would be extremely luminous like SN 2006tf or SN 2006gy. The explosion could be associated with gamma-ray bursts (GRB) and it will also produce a shock wave of a speed of a few thousand kilometers per second that could hit the surrounding envelope of material, causing strong emission for many years after the explosion. For a star as massive as VY CMa, the remnant would be probably a black hole rather than a neutron star.

The blue half-ring centered near the left edge represents the orbit of Neptune, the outermost planet of the Solar System. A hypergiant (luminosity class 0 or Ia+) is a very rare type of star that has an extremely high luminosity, mass, size and mass loss because of their extreme stellar winds. The term hypergiant is defined as luminosity class 0 (zero) in the MKK system. However, this is rarely seen in the literature or in published spectral classifications, except for specific well-defined groups such as the yellow hypergiants, RSG (red supergiants), or blue B(e) supergiants with emission spectra. More commonly, hypergiants are classed as Ia-0 or Ia+, but red supergiants are rarely assigned these spectral classifications. Astronomers are interested in these stars because they relate to understanding stellar evolution, especially with star formation, stability, and their expected demise as supernovae. Origin and definition In 1956, the astronomers Feast and Thackeray used the term super-supergiant (later changed into hypergiant) for stars with an absolute magnitude brighter than MV = −7 (MBol will be larger for very cool and very hot stars, for example at least −9.7 for a B0 hypergiant). In 1971, Keenan suggested that the term would be used only for supergiants showing at least one broad emission component in Hα, indicating an extended stellar atmosphere or a relatively large mass loss rate. The Keenan criterion is the one most commonly used by scientists today. To be classified as a hypergiant, a star must be highly luminous and have spectral signatures showing atmospheric instability and high mass loss. Hence it is possible for a non-hypergiant, supergiant star to have the same or higher luminosity as a hypergiant of the same spectral class. Hypergiants are expected to have a characteristic broadening and red-shifting of their spectral lines, producing a distinctive spectral shape known as a P Cygni profile. The use of hydrogen emission lines is not helpful for defining the coolest hypergiants, and these are largely classified by luminosity since mass loss is almost inevitable for the class. Formation Stars with an initial mass above about quickly move away from the main sequence and increase somewhat in luminosity to become blue supergiants. They cool and enlarge at approximately constant luminosity to become a red supergiant, then contract and increase in temperature as the outer layers are blown away. They may \\"bounce\\" backwards and forwards executing one or more \\"blue loops\\", still at a fairly steady luminosity, until they explode as a supernova or completely shed their outer layers to become a Wolf–Rayet star. Stars with an initial mass above about are simply too luminous to develop a stable extended atmosphere and so they never cool sufficiently to become red supergiants. The most massive stars, especially rapidly rotating stars with enhanced convection and mixing, may skip these steps and move directly to the Wolf–Rayet stage. This means that stars at the top of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram where hypergiants are found may be newly evolved from the main sequence and still with high mass, or much more evolved post-red supergiant stars that have lost a significant fraction of their initial mass, and these objects cannot be distinguished simply on the basis of their luminosity and temperature. High- mass stars with a high proportion of remaining hydrogen are more stable, while older stars with lower masses and a higher proportion of heavy elements have less stable atmospheres due to increased radiation pressure and decreased gravitational attraction. These are thought to be the hypergiants, near the Eddington limit and rapidly losing mass. The yellow hypergiants are thought to be generally post-red supergiant stars that have already lost most of their atmospheres and hydrogen. A few more stable high mass yellow supergiants with approximately the same luminosity are known and thought to be evolving towards the red supergiant phase, but these are rare as this is expected to be a rapid transition. Because yellow hypergiants are post-red supergiant stars, there is a fairly hard upper limit to their luminosity at around , but blue hypergiants can be much more luminous, sometimes several million . Almost all hypergiants exhibit variations in luminosity over time due to instabilities within their interiors, but these are small except for two distinct instability regions where luminous blue variables (LBVs) and yellow hypergiants are found. Because of their high masses, the lifetime of a hypergiant is very short in astronomical timescales: only a few million years compared to around 10 billion years for stars like the Sun. Hypergiants are only created in the largest and densest areas of star formation and because of their short lives, only a small number are known despite their extreme luminosity that allows them to be identified even in neighbouring galaxies. The time spent in some phases such as LBVs can be as short as a few thousand years.  Stability  Great nebula in Carina, surrounding Eta Carinae As the luminosity of stars increases greatly with mass, the luminosity of hypergiants often lies very close to the Eddington limit, which is the luminosity at which the radiation pressure expanding the star outward equals the force of the star's gravity collapsing the star inward. This means that the radiative flux passing through the photosphere of a hypergiant may be nearly strong enough to lift off the photosphere. Above the Eddington limit, the star would generate so much radiation that parts of its outer layers would be thrown off in massive outbursts; this would effectively restrict the star from shining at higher luminosities for longer periods. A good candidate for hosting a continuum- driven wind is Eta Carinae, one of the most massive stars ever observed. With an estimated mass of around 130 solar masses and a luminosity four million times that of the Sun, astrophysicists speculate that Eta Carinae may occasionally exceed the Eddington limit. The last time might have been a series of outbursts observed in 1840–1860, reaching mass loss rates much higher than our current understanding of what stellar winds would allow. As opposed to line-driven stellar winds (that is, ones driven by absorbing light from the star in huge numbers of narrow spectral lines), continuum driving does not require the presence of \\"metallic\\" atoms — atoms other than hydrogen and helium, which have few such lines — in the photosphere. This is important, since most massive stars also are very metal-poor, which means that the effect must work independently of the metallicity. In the same line of reasoning, the continuum driving may also contribute to an upper mass limit even for the first generation of stars right after the Big Bang, which did not contain any metals at all. Another theory to explain the massive outbursts of, for example, Eta Carinae is the idea of a deeply situated hydrodynamic explosion, blasting off parts of the star's outer layers. The idea is that the star, even at luminosities below the Eddington limit, would have insufficient heat convection in the inner layers, resulting in a density inversion potentially leading to a massive explosion. The theory has, however, not been explored very much, and it is uncertain whether this really can happen. Another theory associated with hypergiant stars is the potential to form a pseudo- photosphere, that is a spherical optically dense surface that is actually formed by the stellar wind rather than being the true surface of the star. Such a pseudo-photosphere would be significantly cooler than the deeper surface below the outward-moving dense wind. This has been hypothesized to account for the \\"missing\\" intermediate-luminosity LBVs and the presence of yellow hypergiants at approximately the same luminosity and cooler temperatures. The yellow hypergiants are actually the LBVs having formed a pseudo-photosphere and so apparently having a lower temperature.  Relationships with Ofpe, WNL, LBV, and other supergiant stars  Very Large Telescope image of the surroundings of VY Canis Majoris Hypergiants are evolved, high luminosity, high-mass stars that occur in the same or similar regions of the HR diagram to stars with different classifications. It is not always clear whether the different classifications represent stars with different initial conditions, stars at different stages of an evolutionary track, or is just an artifact of our observations. Astrophysical models explaining the phenomena show many areas of agreement. Yet there are some distinctions that are not necessarily helpful in establishing relationships between different types of stars. Although most supergiant stars are less luminous than hypergiants of similar temperature, a few fall within the same luminosity range. Ordinary supergiants compared to hypergiants often lack the strong hydrogen emissions whose broadened spectral lines indicate significant mass loss. Evolved lower mass supergiants do not return from the red supergiant phase, either exploding as supernovae or leaving behind a white dwarf. Luminous blue variables are a class of highly luminous hot stars that display characteristic spectral variation. They often lie in a \\"quiescent\\" zone with hotter stars generally being more luminous, but periodically undergo large surface eruptions and move to a narrow zone where stars of all luminosities have approximately the same temperature, around 8,000K. This \\"active\\" zone is near the hot edge of the unstable \\"void\\" where yellow hypergiants are found, with some overlap. It is not clear whether yellow hypergiants ever manage to get past the instability void to become LBVs or explode as a supernova. Blue hypergiants are found in the same parts of the HR diagram as LBVs but do not necessarily show the LBV variations. Some but not all LBVs show the characteristics of hypergiant spectra at least some of the time, but many authors would exclude all LBVs from the hypergiant class and treat them separately. Blue hypergiants that do not show LBV characteristics may be progenitors of LBVs, or vice versa, or both. Lower mass LBVs may be a transitional stage to or from cool hypergiants or are different type of object. Wolf–Rayet stars are extremely hot stars that have lost much or all of their outer layers. WNL is a term used for late stage (i.e. cooler) Wolf–Rayet stars with spectra dominated by nitrogen. Although these are generally thought to be the stage reached by hypergiant stars after sufficient mass loss, it is possible that a small group of hydrogen-rich WNL stars are actually progenitors of blue hypergiants or LBVs. These are the closely related Ofpe (O-type spectra plus H, He, and N emission lines, and other peculiarities) and WN9 (the coolest nitrogen Wolf–Rayet stars) which may be a brief intermediate stage between high mass main-sequence stars and hypergiants or LBVs. Quiescent LBVs have been observed with WNL spectra and apparent Ofpe/WNL stars have changed to show blue hypergiant spectra. High rotation rates cause massive stars to shed their atmospheres quickly and prevent the passage from main sequence to supergiant, so these directly become Wolf–Rayet stars. Wolf Rayet stars, slash stars, cool slash stars (aka WN10/11), Ofpe, Of+, and Of* stars are not considered hypergiants. Although they are luminous and often have strong emission lines, they have characteristic spectra of their own.  Known hypergiants  Hypergiants are difficult to study due to their rarity. Many hypergiants have highly variable spectra, but they are grouped here into broad spectral classes. = Luminous blue variables = Some luminous blue variables are classified as hypergiants, during at least part of their cycle of variation: * Eta Carinae, inside the Carina Nebula (NGC 3372) in the southern constellation of Carina.

On January 5, 1919, the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice encouraged a police raid in which the manager and nine customers were arrested for lewd behavior. It was raided again in 1920 with 15 arrests. It was patronized largely by homosexuals by the 1920s and became the community's preeminent social venue from the 1930s onward.

Emlyn Williams described a visit in 1927: :Up some stairs at a desk an ashen bored man in shirtsleeves produced a ledger crammed with illegible scrawls. I added mine, paid my dollar, was handed a key, towel and robe, hung the key on my wrist and mounted to a large floor as big as a warehouse and as high: intersecting rows of private rooms each windowless cell dark except from the glimmer from above through wire-netting shredded with dust and containing a narrow workhouse bed...[he later heard] a casual whisper, a sigh lighter than thistle-down, a smothered moan. Then appeasement: the snap of a lighter as two strangers sat back for a smoke and polite murmured small talk, such as they might exchange in a gym. Among the documented patrons were Alfred Lunt, Clifton Webb, Noël Coward, Lorenz Hart, Truman Capote, Charles James, Gore Vidal and Rudolf Nureyev. Truman Capote and Ned Rorem wrote about their visits. On May 25, 1977, nine patrons (ages 17 to 40) were killed in a fire: seven from smoke inhalation, one from respiratory burns, and one who had jumped from an upper floor. Contributing factors were the deteriorating conditions and the lack of sprinklers.Scott Bronstein, “4 New York Bathhouses Still Operate Under City’s Program of Inspections,” The New York Times (3 May 1987). Firefighters said they were thwarted in rescue efforts by paneling covering the windows.

Before his dinner speech, Jack psyches himself up in the men's room, completely forgetting that he is wearing a microphone and that everyone can hear him. Liz quickly takes the stage to draw attention away from Jack's embarrassment and finally ends up ripping her blouse open and dancing in front of everyone. She succeeds, and is banned from the retreat forever. Meanwhile, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) employs method acting for her upcoming role as singer Janis Joplin, thus allowing Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander) to take advantage of her. He tells her to do her research on Joplin on English Wikipedia, then edits the page contents with nonsense when Jenna goes off to read it. Jenna, however, believes what she reads and proceeds to imitate all the \\"facts\\" on the page to the amusement of everyone. When she finally confronts Frank, they end up having sex and Jenna is affronted when Frank wants to keep it a secret from their co-workers. She reveals their fling in front of the other TGS with Tracy Jordan writers to the dismay of Frank. At hearing this, Katie (Elizabeth Rouse), the show's hair dresser and Frank's girlfriend, ruins Jenna's hair and face making her look like a witch. At the same time, NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) tries to help Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) understand how diabetes affects him after Dr. Leo Spaceman (Chris Parnell) told Tracy that he is at risk of getting diabetes. Kenneth tells him a story of how a wicked witch will come and take him away if he continues to consume his unhealthy eating habits but Tracy does not believe him. Tracy gets disgusted when Kenneth tries to scare him by dressing as a witch but suddenly Jenna comes running in screaming and looking like a witch complete with a broomstick in hand. This scares both Kenneth and Tracy who fearfully vows to change his eating habits immediately. Production \\"Retreat to Move Forward\\" was directed by Steve Buscemi \\"Retreat to Move Forward\\" was written by executive story editor Tami Sagher and directed by Steve Buscemi. This was Sagher's second writing credit, having written season two episode \\"Ludachristmas\\" that aired on December 13, 2007. This was Buscemi's first directed episode. \\"Retreat to Move Forward\\" originally aired on January 22, 2009, on NBC in the United States as the ninth episode of the show's third season and the 45th overall episode of the series. Buscemi has appeared on the show as the character Lenny Wosniak, a private investigator who has been hired by Jack Donaghy in the episodes \\"The Collection\\", \\"The Natural Order\\", \\"Mamma Mia\\", and \\"Season 4\\". Actor Chris Parnell reprised his role as Dr. Leo Spaceman in this episode. This was Parnell's ninth appearance on the show. Cultural references At the beginning of this 30 Rock episode, Liz tells Jack that she and Jenna used to perform improvisation at corporate retreats. In a flashback, the audience shout out Sling Blade and Oprah as suggestions for Liz and Jenna to do. Liz does the impression of the Sling Blade character, but Jenna believed that Liz was Oprah. Tracy becomes intrigued with the idea of having his foot replaced with a wheel, after Dr. Spaceman informs him that if diabetes is left untreated he could lose a foot, to which he asks Dr. Spaceman \\"Could I replace it with a wheel like Rosie from The Jetsons?\\" Rosie is the humanoid robot maid for the title family, and she rolls about on a set of caster wheels. When the TGS writers learn from Jenna that she will be employing method acting, Frank suggests that she do her research of Janis Joplin on Wikipedia, the free online encyclopedia. When Frank sees Jenna getting ready to eat a cat, he stops her and tells her that ALF, an extraterrestrial, eats cats. After admitting that she hooked up with Frank, Jenna reveals that Dog the Bounty Hunter is the second grossest guy she has ever been with. Later in the episode, to cover-up for Jack, after psyching himself up and completely forgetting that he was wearing a microphone and that everyone could hear him, Liz starts singing the song \\"Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)\\" by dance music group C+C Music Factory. \\"Retreat to Move Forward\\" references Jack's time in the Bush administration that occurred in the show's second season, and Jack's unsuccessful attempts of becoming CEO of General Electric in the December 4, 2008, episode \\"Reunion\\", after Don Geiss (Rip Torn)—who woke up from his diabetic coma—informs him he wants to remain as CEO of the company. This was the second time 30 Rock referenced Jenna trying to play singer Janis Joplin in a feature film. This plot first began in the episode, \\"Señor Macho Solo\\", in which Jenna auditions to play the singer in a biographical movie. Reception In its original American broadcast, \\"Retreat to Move Forward\\" was watched by 6.4 million households, according to the Nielsen Media Research. This episode earned a 3.2 rating/8 share in the 18 and 49 demographic, meaning that 3.2 percent of all people in that group, and 8 percent of all people from that group watching television at the time, watched the episode. This was a decrease from the previous episode, \\"Flu Shot\\", which was watched by 6.6 million American viewers. Television columnist Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger felt that \\"Retreat to Move Forward\\" was one of the best episodes of an uneven season. Sepinwall, however, felt it \\"petered out\\" towards the end, and that the Tracy and Kenneth plot did not work until it met the Jenna and Frank story. He noted that without the addition of a guest star, \\"this one made good use of virtually the entire cast\\". IGN contributor Robert Canning enjoyed Liz and Jack's relationship in the episode. Canning felt that while the show occasionally hints at a romantic relationship between the two, they should never become linked. In his opinion, the episode demonstrated their non-romantic friendship \\"perfectly\\". Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad liked the episode, but noted \\"...it's the second week in a row where one of the plots was way too over the top for me.\\" Sassone wrote that he was not thrilled with the Kenneth and Tracy plot, citing that it was \\"way too silly and loud\\". TV Guide's Matt Mitovich said that \\"Retreat to Move Forward\\" was \\"[a]nother very funny, super-huge-guest-star-free episode\\". Rick Porter of Zap2it reported that he found himself \\"more attracted\\" to the second-tier plots than to the Jack and Liz plot, observing that it \\"had its moments, but the overall story didn't hit too many new notes in their relationship. [...] So yeah, some funny bits here and there with the main story ... But we've seen this kind of dynamic between Liz and Jack before, and so it didn't have the same comedic force as in the past.\\" Kevin D. Thompson for The Palm Beach Post praised 30 Rock for doing a perfect job with its three plots in the episode, and said that Jenna's line, \\"The academy loves dead singers and the handicapped. And Janis was both!\\", was \\"[h]ands-down, the funniest line of the show.\\" The A.V. Club's Nathan Rabin, who had been favorable to Jenna's story arc of her playing Joplin, was not impressed with her antics in this episode. In regards to the episode itself, Rabin opined, \\"Tonight's episode was consistently amusing but 30 Rock engenders such sky-high expectations that being good oftentimes just isn't good enough.\\" In conclusion, he gave the episode a B grade rating. \\"'Retreat to Move Forward' had some amusing moments, but it's a bit unmemorable in retrospect. I'm still waiting for a true classic 30 Rock episode this season\\", said Jeremy Medina for Paste magazine. Nonetheless, Medina preferred this episode over The Office's \\"Prince Family Paper\\", in which its plot focused on whether actress Hilary Swank was attractive or not.

Since its beginning in 1989 when it was launched as the Maritime Music Awards by Halifax music industry promoter Rob Cohn, it has grown from the original five categories (Album of the Year, Female Artist of the Year, Male Artist of the Year, Song of the Year, and Video of the Year) to over 40 categories for artist, industry and honorary awards. History From 1989 in a Halifax bar, the East Coast Music Awards and Conference has grown to become the premier music event in Atlantic Canada, and one of the top events of its kind on the continent. In 1991, Founder of the Maritime Music Awards, Rob Cohn, joined forces with Sheri Jones, Karen Byers, Lee Stanley, Mike Barkhouse, Peter Hendrickson, Bruce Morel and Tony Kelly to form the East Coast Music Association. The event became known as the East Coast Music Awards and now combined the Atlantic provinces. It moved from a Halifax bar to the Rebecca Cohn Auditorium and new awards were added. A showcase by The Rankins helped the band get a manager and, later, an EMI record deal. With the formation of provincial music industry associations it was decided that the event would move from year to year from Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, P.E.I and Nfld and Labrador. In recent years, the East Coast Music Awards and Conference has showcased the music of Atlantic Canada, bringing it to millions of record buyers in a two-hour national broadcast on CBC Television. The first televised broadcast of the event took place in St. John's NFLD, due to efforts by the Association and Glen Tilley, A producer at CBC St. John's and head of the nomination committee for NFLD & Labrador during the critical first years transition of the association to a non-profit status. And the ECMA's have marketed Atlantic Canadian music to the world, by inviting members of the international music industry to the annual conference. =2000 Gala= Sydney, Nova Scotia, hosted a grassroots event that pushed its organizational and infrastructure capacities to the limit. An economically successful event paved the way for the ECMA to regain a sound financial footing, and it commemorates the influence of Cape Breton's Celtic Music family, including the late John Morris Rankin. Showcases abound, and events like Radio FreECMA and the Continuous Jam ignite industry attention. The awards show receives a Gemini Award for Best Music, Variety Program or Series. =2001 Gala= Charlottetown attracted more than 1,700 delegates and highlighted the diversity of the East Coast Canadian music scene. Emerging and established artists came together in a barrage of new showcases, including the debut of the Jazz/Classical Concert Series. The event fostered renewed interest in the formation of the P.E.I. Music Awards and creates Soundwaves, a program that sees musicians visiting schools throughout the province, and hospitals, businesses and churches in Charlottetown. The Ennis Sisters sign with Warner Music and the ECMA Award Show receives another Gemini Award for Best Music, Variety Program or Series. =2002 Gala= Saint John, New Brunswick, hosted ECMA 2002. The competitive bid process in New Brunswick sparked community involvement and led to over 2200 delegates to attend. Saint John brings new initiatives: the wildly popular Roots Room for acoustic performances, the UniSon bilingual concert, and the bluegrass stage that attracts an estimated 5,000 fans. In addition to the national CBC Television broadcast of the awards show, the MuchMusic ECMA Rock stage got a prime-time special on Much, and CBC Radio's Definitely Not the Opera broadcast live from the main showcase stage. =2003 Gala= ECMA 2003 in Halifax, Nova Scotia, brought the conference back to where it all began 15 years before, and to celebrate this anniversary, the entire city came alive with music and was transformed into a City of Stages, celebrating all genres of music. It was a resounding success, having played host to over 2000 delegates. The Soundwaves Program brought music to over 30,000 young school students throughout the region, and corporate sponsorship and support for ECMA reached new heights. Halifax celebrated Urban Music with an Urban Music Series featuring hip-hop, R&B; and the Black Vibes concert. ECMA 2003 brought international bookings to several East Coast artists as European music industry professionals were in attendance. =2004 Gala= ECMA 2004 in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador saw international delegates. A strategic partnership was developed with the Atlantic Film Festival, and film and TV elements were introduced to the conference. A number of East Coast recording artists negotiated contracts for national licensing and distribution deals. The ECMA Songwriter's Circle was broadcast live across the country on CBC Radio and across Atlantic Canada on CBC Television. =2005 Gala= ECMA 2005 in Sydney, Nova Scotia, was a great success and helped to kick off the opening of two new, multimillion-dollar facilities in Sydney. For both the Membertou Trade and Convention Centre and the Sydney Marine Terminal, ECMA was the first major event to use their facilities, and offered a great opportunity to introduce them to the community and the international industry delegates attending the conference. The conference was taken to a new level with very popular sessions, a vibrant international program (50+ delegates) and successful partnering with Cape Breton University. Overall, ECMA is moving towards a master class format, presenting classes this year in songwriting, export readiness and musical scoring for gaming and television. The success of the Soundwaves was built upon with the creation of a brand new program, Sound- off, which involved schools across Cape Breton to select the best band in their school and advance them to regionals and a final competition. =2006 Gala= ECMA returned to Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, in 2006. Charlottetown has been a laboratory from which such experiments as RadioECMA, Soundwaves and the 72 Hour Jam have sprung. For the first time ever, 2006 organizers decided to have a gala dinner industry awards ceremony on Saturday night. The controversial Trailer Park Boys hosted a great award show at the Civic Centre, proving many skeptics wrong and the organization right on the mark. A major highlight of 2006 was that a festival was created within the Delta Prince Edward host hotel. The music, business and networking went virtually around the clock. =2007 Gala= Halifax, Nova Scotia, once again hosted ECMA, a year early, as a result of a request to flip from the Fredericton, New Brunswick, location. The Halifax event, introduced as the East Coast Music Awards, Festival and Conference, measures as a major industry and financial success. An amazing and insightful four-day conference, with record attendance, wonderful venues and things on the technical end (sound and lights), and an ever-growing international program with over 50 international music industry delegates. With 500 hotel rooms in two adjoining Delta hotels, there was a festival atmosphere in the hotels and adjoining malls. The 2007 award show was regarded by many as one of the best ever. The show marks the recent passing of East Coast legends John Allan Cameron, Dutch Mason and Denny Doherty. ECMAfest brought the downtown Halifax to life with many official and partnered stages. =2008 Gala= ECMA 2008 was held in Fredericton, New Brunswick from February 7 through 10. Throughout the event, various venues played host to the East Coast's finest artists. The music awards gala was held at the Aitken Centre, and Steven Page from the Barenaked Ladies hosted the entire event (coining the term \\"Barenaked East Coast Music\\"). Unlike previous years the event was not televised, and instead, a TV special was broadcast with scenes (venues, award show, various hotel antics). The year's big winner was Joel Plaskett Emergency who walked away with seven awards, most centering on the acclaimed concept release Ashtray Rock. =2009 Gala= The 2009 ECMA Awards Conference and Awards Gala took place in the city of Corner Brook, Newfoundland and Labrador. The hosts for the event were Damhnait Doyle and Jian Ghomeshi of CBC Radio One's Q. The line-up of artists included Hey Rosetta!, Jill Barber, Tara Oram, Christina Martin, MIR, and David Myles. The ECMA Awards Show also featured the reunion of Rawlins Cross. =2010 Gala= The 2010 event took place in Sydney, Nova Scotia, on Cape Breton. Joel Plaskett was the night's big winner with six awards, including Sennheiser Entertainer of the Year. =2011 Gala= ECMA returned to Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, in 2011 and was hosted within the Delta Prince Edward host hotel. The music, business and networking went virtually around the clock. =2012 Gala= East Coast Music Week 2012 was staged in Moncton, NB. Jimmy Rankin led with eight nominations. Presented for the second year, A Sound Celebration brought together musicians from three of NB’s premier orchestras including Atlantic Simphonia, Symphony New Brunswick and the New Brunswick Youth Orchestra along with four pop stars – Chris Colepaugh, David Myles, Samantha Robichaud and Matt Andersen. ECMA partnered with the Province of New Brunswick and the local Capitol Theatre to host a First Nation’s showcase, the first of its kind. The ECMA Breakout Stage was launched, a new program for emerging artists. The program uses both workshops and performances to foster artists and groups newer to the music industry. The ECMA also developed its first web-based app It was the second time the city hosted the gala. In 1997, an unprecedented 7,000 awards show guests attend the televised broadcast in Moncton, NB, (with special guest Edith Butler and broadcaster Peter Gzowski) delegates clamor to the 76-hour jam session and a concert series featuring headliners Bruce Guthro, Great Big Sea, Four the Moment and Barachois. Moncton brings an Acadian flavor to a gathering that attracts more than 1,500 delegates, including 200 media from around the world. The event injects $3-million into the local economy. The association’s board of directors continues to develop its mandate as provincial music industry associations take hold throughout Atlantic Canada. Bruce Guthro signs with EMI Music Canada. =2013 Gala= The 2013 East Coast Music Awards were held in Halifax, Nova Scotia, on March 10. = 2014 East Coast Music Awards = East Coast Music Week 2014 was held in Charlottetown, PEI from April 2–6, 2014.

Mozart's score is transposed for an orchestra of marimbas, drums and township percussion. The musical, set in contemporary South Africa, re-interprets the story from a South African perspective, telling of Prince Tamino's quest to rescue Pamina (both of them are Xhosa-speaking teenagers), daughter of the Queen of the Night, from the Priest of the Sun. The musical premiered in 2007 at the Baxter Theatre in Cape Town, South Africa, before beginning a tour to the United Kingdom. The production opened at the Young Vic Theatre in London over the festive season, 2007.

Hawkin's Bazaar offers a range of unusual toys, gifts, gadgets and curiosities. They source out-of-the-ordinary products and offer something different, a range of toys and gifts that will appeal to many ages and tastes.  History  A branch of Hawkin's Bazaar on High Ousegate, in York. The company now known as Hawkin's Bazaar started life as a niche mail order toy company founded by Sid Templer in 1973 in Corbridge, Northumberland. The name of the company at that time, TOBAR, is from the first few letters of his son's forenames, Toby and Barnaby. Tobar remains the name of the parent company to this day. In 1976 the mail order company moved premises into an old disused public house, formerly named the Hawk Inn, and decided to adapt the name for themselves as Hawkin's & Co; Bazaar was added to the name later. In 1989 the company moved premises again to a former farm, Elm House in St Margaret South Elmham; Toby took over the running of the company from his father, Sid. It was also around this time that he company opened its first retail shop in Salisbury. In 1998 the company launched their websites, shortly after beginning to open retail locations across the United Kingdom. Also in the 1990s the company began to sell into the European markets and opened a European wholesale branch, TOBAR France in 2010. In 2007 the company moved to a £10 million facility in Worlingham, before moving to Norfolk in 2013. Also in 2007 they launched a sub-brand, Stocking Fillers. 2013 marked the company's 40th year in business. Whilst a lot has changed since Hawkin's Bazaar launched as a mail order service, the company still refers to its original values with taglines such as “Unusual gifts for every occasion, since 1973”Hawkin’s Bazaar September 2012 Catalogue and “Suppliers to Father Christmas since 1973”Hawkin’s Bazaar November 2012 Catalogue adorning their mail order catalogues and other communications. In addition to high street shops and mail order catalogues the company continues to operate online. Its website was updated and re-launched in August 2012. = 2012 administration = On 23 January 2012, Hawkin's Bazaar (and Tobar Group) were bought by Primary Capital from administration through a management buy-out although they did already own the company in the first place. The company continued trading in 2012 and opened several additional stores towards the end of the year (some at previous sites). As of December 2012, the company had 27 stores open around the UK. During 2012 the Tobar Group achieved sales of over £20 million and employed 250 people. In December 2015 the company was bought in a management buy-out supported by private equity firm Merino. While under the ownership of Merino, Tobar acquired Bluw Limited in 2016, a Scottish toy company, H Grossman (established 1946, Glasgow), in March 2018 and an educational company, Kit for Kids, in March 2019. = 2020 administration = In 2018 the company made a £978,344 loss on sales of £15.3 million.

A seminal moment in his career occurred in late 1992, when Earl Klugh asked McGill to build a more refined version of a Del Vecchio resonator guitar that Klugh had received from Chet Atkins. Though Klugh enjoyed the Brazilian guitar's sound, he found it delicate, with poor intonation.Simone Solondz Gearbox Acoustic Guitar, Jun 1997 Though McGill was apprehensive, fearing that building such an unusual instrument would ruin his reputation as a builder of classical guitars, he built the instrument as requested.

The next stop to the north was 133rd Street for the main line and Willis Avenue for the Willis Avenue spur, both of which were across a swing bridge above the Harlem River in the Bronx. The next stop to the south was 125th Street−Third Avenue for Third Avenue Line trains and 125th Street−Second Avenue for Second Avenue Line trains. Station layout A diagram of the 129th Street station (top right) and the approaches to the Harlem River bridge, with the flyover express tracks shown in dotted lines. The station was located between Second and Third Avenues, oriented west-to- east above and on the south side of 129th Street. The station was double- decked, with four island platforms for passengers and numerous tracks. The northernmost platform was used by shuttle service via the Willis Avenue Spur to Willis Avenue station, connecting to the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad. The next platform south was for through-service from the Third Avenue Line to and from the Bronx. The southern two island platforms were used for terminating trains, specifically those of the Second Avenue Line and some local Third Avenue trains. The Second Avenue Line fed into the southernmost platform, while the Third Avenue Line fed into both terminal platforms. All four platforms featured shelters. The platforms were connected by a covered bridge. A bi-directional flyover express track from the Third Avenue El bypassed the station. Adjacent to the south of the station was a storage yard, extending south to 128th Street. An additional side platform was located at the north end of the yard, used only by employees. North of the station, Third Avenue, Willis Avenue, and Second Avenue trains (the latter of which came from 125th Street and bypassed 129th Street) would use the bi-level swing bridge at the north end of Second Avenue, crossing the Harlem River towards the Bronx. The exit to the station was located at Third Avenue and East 129th Street. The station also served as the terminal for numerous streetcar routes from the Bronx. History The station originally opened on December 30, 1878, as part of the extension of the Third Avenue Line north of 67th Street. The station was originally a two-track island platform terminal located above Third Avenue. It served as the original terminal for the line, until it was extended across the Harlem River to the Bronx on May 17, 1886. On November 25, 1886, the station gained a connection to the Willis Avenue Spur which took commuters to a terminal station in the Bronx that served commuters using the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad and later to the New York, Westchester and Boston Railway interurban lines. This added a second platform oriented west- to-east for Willis Avenue trains, which was connected to the Third Avenue El platform. The Willis Avenue shuttle ended service on December 18, 1887, but was restored on July 19, 1891. On August 1, 1891, the New Haven began running rapid transit cars from 129th via the Willis Spur and the New York and Harlem Railroad (today's Harlem Line). On August 15, 1898, a new and enlarged 129th Street station was opened between Second and Third Avenue. The 129th Street Yard was also opened at this time. Both the yard and station were constructed from 1886 to 1898. The original station was abandoned and eventually razed. Around 1907, the IRT planned to add a bi-directional express track to both the Second and Third Avenue lines, and build a new double-decked bridge with four tracks over the Harlem River. This was carried out during the Dual Contracts in the 1910s, adding 129th Street station's flyover express track. Express service began on January 17, 1916. All service via the Willis Avenue Spur ended on April 14, 1924, when a pedestrian bridge was opened between the Willis Avenue and 133rd Street stations. The opening of the lines of the New York City Subway, particularly the IRT Lexington Avenue Line, in the early 20th century led to declining ridership on the elevated lines. The Els were also scapegoated for blight and urban ills in the surrounding neighborhoods. The 129th Street station in particular had low ridership, due to its proximity to the busy 125th Street station. It was also criticized for its uninspired design compared to the other stations on the lines. Following unification of the transit system under the city's Board of Transportation, the Second Avenue Line stopped serving the station on June 11, 1940 when it was closed north of 57th Street. With reduced service and low ridership, the 129th Street station was closed prematurely on July 1, 1950. Passengers were redirected to the 125th Street station, while express trains between Manhattan and the Bronx bypassed the station. The rest of the line south of 149th Street in the Bronx closed on May 12, 1955.NYCTA Notice of Third Avenue Rail Closure for May 12, 1955 The site became part of Harlem River Park.

In English it was known as the Special Expedition. The expedition, 5,500 strong, arrived in America on 11 July 1780. A second wave of 2,500 was intended to join them but was unable to escape the British blockade of Brest. After remaining inactive for almost a year, Rochambeau marched his troops south to rendezvous with George Washington's Continental Army for a planned attack on New York City. At Rochambeau's urging, Washington abandoned the planned attack and instead they moved into Virginia to join with the French fleet of Admiral François de Grasse to trap Lord Cornwallis's British army at Yorktown, forcing its surrender in October 1781. Background France had been in contact with colonial radicals as early as 1774. In January 1776 France began sending large amounts of covert financial aid and military supplies to the American rebels. Following the loss of a British army during the Saratoga Campaign of 1777, France signed a Treaty of Alliance recognising American Independence in February 1778. This established the Franco-American Alliance. A French fleet under Charles Hector, comte d'Estaing, sailed out to co-operate against the British, and was widely expected to help bring a swift end to the war. The initial attempts to seek victory were beset by problems. An operation against Newport miscarried in 1778, the following year, the Franco-American Siege of Savannah ended in defeat. D'Estaing and his ships then sailed for home, with relations between the allies severely strained.  Expedition  On 2 May 1780, Admiral Ternay d'Arsac departed Brest with a 7-ship and 3-frigate squadron, escorting 36 transports carrying troops to support the Continental Army in the War of American Independence. The squadron comprised the 80-gun Duc de Bourgogne, under Ternay d'Arsac (admiral) and Médine (flag captain); the 74-gun Neptune, under Sochet Des Touches, and Conquérant, under La Grandière; and the 64-gun Provence under Lombard, Ardent under Bernard de Marigny, Jason under La Clocheterie and Éveillé under Le Gardeur de Tilly, and the frigates Surveillante under Villeneuve Cillart, Amazone under La Pérouse, and Bellone. Amazone, which constituted the vanguard of the fleet, arrived at Boston on 11 June 1780. =Yorktown Campaign= Siège de Yorktown by Auguste Couder, c.1836.Conserved in the Galerie des Batailles, Château de Versailles, France.

In July 1781, Rochambeau's army left Rhode Island and marched across Connecticut to join Washington's army on the Hudson River at Dobbs Ferry, New York. From there the combined forces marched overland to Virginia. During this time, Admiral de Grasse managed to defeat a British fleet sent from New York City to evacuate British General Charles Cornwallis at the Battle of the Chesapeake on September 5, trapping Cornwallis on the Yorktown peninsula. On September 22, Rochambeau and Washington combined forces with those of Marquis de Lafayette and began the siege of Yorktown. The siege ended with the surrender of Cornwallis on October 19, 1781.

However, by then the Peace of Paris had been agreed and the planned 1783 campaign in the Caribbean never took place.

The Court was established by Parliament in 1974 to combat rising gun violence, and empowered to try suspects in camera, without a jury. The Supreme Court, Circuit Courts, and Resident Magistrate's Courts function as Gun Courts whenever they hear firearms cases. There is also a Western Regional Gun Court in Montego Bay. Those convicted by the Gun Court are imprisoned in a dedicated prison compound at South Camp in Kingston. Until 1999, the Gun Court sessions were also held in the same facility. The long sentences of the Gun Court and its restrictions on the rights of the accused have given rise to constitutional challenges, some of which have been appealed to the Privy Council in London. These cases have resulted in some modifications to the court, but have upheld it on the whole. The Gun Court system has also been the target of criticism because of its lengthy delay in hearing cases, and the continuing rise in gun violence since its adoption.  Background  In the early 1970s, Jamaica experienced a rise in violence associated with criminal gangs and political polarization between supporters of the People's National Party and the Jamaica Labour Party. After a rash of killings of lawyers and businessmen in 1974, the government of Michael Manley attempted to restore order by granting broad new law enforcement powers in the Suppression of Crime Act and the Gun Court Act. The Suppression of Crime Act allowed the police and the military to work together in a novel way to disarm the people: soldiers sealed off entire neighbourhoods, and policemen systematically searched the houses inside for weapons without requiring a warrant. The goal was to expedite and improve enforcement of the 1967 Firearms Act, which imposed licensing requirements on ownership and possession of guns and ammunition, and prohibited automatic weapons entirely.The Firearms Act, 2.(1): > \\"prohibited weapon\\" means- > :::(A) any artillery or automatic firearm; or :::(B) any grenade, bomb or > other like missile.\\" The Firearms Act, 29.(2): > No licence, certificate or permit shall be granted in relation to any > prohibited weapon. Firearm licences in Jamaica require a background check, inspection and payment of a yearly fee, and can make legal gun ownership difficult for ordinary citizens. The new judicial procedures of the Gun Court Act were designed to ensure that firearms violations would be tried quickly and harshly punished. Prime Minister Michael Manley expressed his determination to take stronger action against firearms, predicting that \\"It will be a long war. No country can win a war against crime overnight, but we shall win. By the time we have finished with them, Jamaican gunmen will be sorry they ever heard of a thing called a gun.\\" In order to win this war, Manley believed it necessary to fully disarm the public: \\"There is no place in this society for the gun, now or ever.\\"  History = Establishment = The Gun Court Act and the Suppression of Crime Act were passed in special simultaneous sessions of the Senate and House of Representatives, and immediately signed into law by Governor-General Florizel Glasspole on 1 April 1974. The new court had several extraordinary features. Most trials were to be conducted in camera, without a jury and closed to the public and the press, in order to avoid problems of intimidation of witnesses and jurors. There was no provision for bail, either pre-trial or during appeal, since all defendants were considered dangerous. Most offences carried a single, mandatory sentence: indefinite imprisonment with hard labour. A convicted offender could be released only upon special decision of the Governor-General, advised by an appointed review board. = Legal challenges and amendments = The unusual features of the Gun Court have faced legal challenges, some of which have forced amendment of the Gun Court Act. The case Hinds et al. v. the Queen was an early test case for the new court. Four men, Moses Hinds, Henry Martin, Elkanah Hutchinson, and Samuel Thomas, had been arrested and convicted by the Gun Court in 1974 for possession of firearms and ammunition without a licence. They appealed their sentences to Jamaica's highest appellate court, the Court of Appeals, which initially declined to hear the case. However, they were allowed to apply to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London, which agreed to review the legality of the Gun Court system. The Constitution of Jamaica reserves certain serious crimes to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and its divisions. The Gun Court Act had established the Full Court division, with resident magistrates presiding, to try major firearms offences. The Privy Council held that this provision of the Act improperly encroached on the jurisdiction reserved for the Supreme Court, and that the Full Court division was therefore unconstitutional. This fault was remedied in 1976 by replacing the Full Court division with a new High Court division, presided over by a single Supreme Court justice. The Privy Council also found that the institution of an appointed review board to determine the length of sentences was contrary to the doctrine of separation of powers fundamental to the Westminster system of government. According to this principle, sentencing in each particular case is a function of the judiciary, and cannot be assigned to any other body. The 1976 amendment eliminated the review board entirely, leaving life imprisonment without review as the only possible sentence. Another case, Trevor Stone v. the Queen, challenged the denial of jury trial for most gun offences. It was argued that trial by jury is a fundamental and constitutional right guaranteed by tradition in English common law. The Jamaican Court of Appeals rejected this argument in a decision written by Court President Ira DeCordova Rowe in 1980. The court noted that the written Constitution adopted by Jamaica upon independence guaranteed certain rights to criminal defendants, but omitted trial by jury. This case confirmed the Gun Court's power to try all non-capital cases before judges alone. The case of Herbert Bell v. Director of Public Prosecutions, concerning the right to a speedy trial, reached the Privy Council in 1983. The defendant had been held awaiting trial for several years, but the state ultimately failed to present any evidence or witnesses. When he was again arrested on the same firearms charges, he filed suit arguing that the Gun Court had violated his constitutional rights through unreasonable delay. The Privy Council agreed, ruling that even when prevailing local standards were taken into account, Bell's trial had been excessively delayed through no fault of his own. The Gun Court Amendment Act of 1983 allowed Resident Magistrates to grant pre-trial bail, and to decide whether to keep firearms cases in the Resident Magistrate's Court or to send them to the High Court division of the Gun Court. Judges were given the power to set sentences other than life imprisonment. Cases involving defendants under 14 years old were directed to juvenile courts, instead of being heard by the ordinary Gun Court, and many young convicts serving indefinite sentences were released.  Structure = Divisions = The Gun Court has three divisions: the Resident Magistrate's Division, the High Court Division, and the Circuit Court Division. The three divisions differ in their jurisdictions and procedures. When someone is charged with a firearm violation, whether by unlicensed possession alone or by use of a gun in commission of a crime, the case is ordinarily sent to the High Court Division. These cases are tried in camera by a justice of the Supreme Court of Jamaica, without a jury. The exceptions are charges of murder and treason. As capital offences, these require a jury trial. Charges of murder or treason using firearms are given preliminary investigation by a single resident magistrate in the Resident Magistrate's Division of the Gun Court, in camera. They are then sent to the Gun Court's Circuit Court Division. A Supreme Court justice presides over a jury trial, \\"exercising the jurisdiction of a Circuit Court.\\" The Circuit Court Division therefore differs from the other divisions of the Gun Court in practicing jury trial. The Gun Court Act originally instituted a Full Court Division, in which cases were to be heard by a panel of three Resident Magistrates. This was replaced by the High Court Division after the Privy Council struck down the Full Court Division in the Hinds case, as judges of the lower levels of the judiciary were not empowered by the Constitution to try serious offences. = Western Regional Gun Court = In 1999, Parliament established a Western Regional Gun Court with its own Resident Magistrate's, High Court, and Circuit Court divisions, in parallel with the jurisdictions and powers of the central Gun Court divisions. Cases arising in four western parishes, Hanover, Trelawny, Saint James, and Westmoreland, are heard in the Regional Court. The Regional Gun Court sits in Montego Bay, in the court facilities of the St. James Resident Magistrate's Court. The regional court has been a success, avoiding the chronic backlogs that affect the central Gun Court. = South Camp compound = At the establishment of the new court in 1974, the Manley administration quickly build a new Gun Court compound () at South Camp Road, Kingston, with both court and prison facilities. The Gun Court Prison was defended by guard towers and barbed wire, earning it the nickname of \\"Jamaica's Stalag 17,\\" and the walls were painted bright red \\"to show that it [is] dread.\\" It held 320 inmates in 1986. The courtrooms housed the High Court and Resident Magistrate's divisions of the Gun Court until 1999, when they were converted to a \\"Peace Centre\\" dedicated to pursuing community mediation of disputes. The High Court division now sits in the Supreme Court building, and the Resident Magistrate's division sits in the Half Way Tree Courthouse. The prison itself remains in operation as the South Camp Adult Correctional Centre, housing inmates convicted by the Gun Court.  Criticism  The Gun Court has faced criticism on several fronts, most notably for its departure from traditional practices, for its large backlog of cases, and for the continuing escalation in gun violence since its institution. At the time of the 1976 amendments to the Act, the Jamaican Bar Association protested against the lack of jury trials and the harsh mandatory sentences. According to a report in the Virgin Islands Daily News, the Association's Bar Council objected to the possibility that children as young as 12 could be imprisoned for life, without release or appeal, for small offences such as being found with used ammunition. The abrogation of jury trial has also been criticized by attorney and law professor David Rowe, the son of the Appeals Court justice who wrote the decision in the Stone case upholding the practice. Rowe argues that the common-law right to a jury trial is implied in the Constitutional provision for \\"a fair hearing within a reasonable time, by an independent and impartial court established by law,\\" concluding that the Constitution had been \\"shorn of its most potent and ancient safeguard, trial by jury.\\" The 1993 County Report on Human Rights Practices in Jamaica from the United States Department of State noted the denial of a \\"fair public trial\\" and alleged that Gun Court trials observe \\"less rigorous rules of evidence than in regular court proceedings.\\" The Canadian Bar Association's Jamaican Justice System Reform Task Force, in its preliminary recommendations, noted that the Gun Court is overloaded, that defendants are not well represented, and Crown attorneys are often inexperienced. The report recommended that trials no longer be held in camera, and that cases be moved to the ordinary Circuit Court to relieve the overburdened Gun Court. It did not take issue with non-jury trials, suggesting that the same practice might be used in more types of cases for greater efficiency. Although the Gun Court was intended to expedite cases, bringing defendants to trial within seven days, defendants now often wait several years. The backlog was nearing 1000 cases in 1998, and in the 2003-2004 court year, the High Court division carried forward 3,367 cases already on the docket, added 613 new cases, and concluded 462. Senior Resident Magistrate Glenn Brown expressed dissatisfaction with the public prosecutors for taking too long to prepare cases, often because of difficulty in finding and bringing witnesses. Brown noted that \\"Seventy per cent of the persons who are before the courts have been here for an inordinately long period of time - three to four years.\\" The Gun Court system has been put forth by gun ownership advocates as an example of a failed regime of gun control. In an essay in the National Review in 2001, Dave Kopel argued that \\"[t]he Gun Court took guns only out of the hands of Jamaica's law-abiding, leaving them at the mercy of the criminals and the state.\\" John R. Lott has argued that \\"gun-control laws have failed to deliver as promised,\\" noting that the murder rate in Jamaica was lower before the introduction of stricter gun control: it rose from 11.5 to 19.5 per 100,000 between 1973 and 1977, and reached 41.7 per 100,000 in 1980. By 2007 the rate had risen to 1,574 murders in the calendar year, or 59 per 100,000 inhabitants.  Gun Court in music  Several Jamaican musicians have sung about the Gun Court, including Junior Reid (Gun Court, 1993) and the dance hall artist Ranking Joe, whose first single release was \\"Gun Court Law\\" in 1974. The reggae musician Jah Cure released his first album, Free Jah's Cure, from Tower Street Prison in 2000 after having been convicted before the Gun Court in 1998. Jah Cure continued to deny the charges of illegal firearms, rape, and robbery, and he attracted widespread support for his release, including \\"Free Jah Cure\\" campaigns and petition drives, until his release in 2007. The French singer Bernard Lavilliers sings about Gun Court in the song Stand the Ghetto released in 1980. He says, in French \\"pour le flingue dans ta poche, t'es coincé à Gun Court\\" (because of the gun in your pocket, you are stuck at Gun Court).

Synopsis Little White Lie follows the story of a luckless actor named Barry who has recently split from his girlfriend. He is seen wallowing at home in his pyjamas, where he becomes fixated on a children's television presenter who he sees on daytime television. The two accidentally collide at an awards ceremony and Barry sets out to impress the presenter. However, he inadvertently lies about his profession, ignoring his actorial status for a career in psychiatry. Reaction One-in-four of the Irish population watched Little White Lie which was aired over a bank holiday weekend. The average audience share was 336,000 or 26.5% of available viewers, labelled as a \\"disappointing turn-off\\" by the tabloid Evening Herald which pinpointed the \\"considerable hype\\" and advertising efforts which had taken place in the preceding weeks. However, a spokeswoman for RTÉ said that the show \\"seemed to go down well with viewers\\" and pointed out that it had hit a peak of 450,000. Another RTÉ spokesperson defended the ratings, saying that \\"this was a drama and would not be comparable to other programmes on this usual slot on a Monday night\\". The drama seemed to disappoint viewers and critics alike, as visible in newspaper reports and on online discussion boards shortly after the broadcast.

The upper level was built as part of the Dual Contracts, and had one track and two side platforms over the two local tracks. History 42nd Street station was built on August 26, 1878, by the New York Elevated Railway Company, and was the penultimate station on the Third Avenue El until it was expanded to 67th Street almost a month later. West of this station, the original line became the Grand Central Shuttle, serving Grand Central Depot until 1899, when it was replaced by Grand Central Station, which was itself replaced by Grand Central Terminal in 1913. From that point on, the next stop to the north was 47th Street for local trains and 106th Street for express trains. The next stop to the south was 34th Street for local trains and 23rd Street for express trains. In 1904, Interborough Rapid Transit opened the Grand Central Subway station, which gained platforms for the IRT Flushing Line in 1915, and new platforms for the expanded IRT Lexington Avenue Line in 1918, the same year the original platforms at the station were converted for the 42nd Street Shuttle.

Kingdom of Romania (before 1947) Before World War II, Romania was primarily agrarian; in the late 1940s, about three- quarters of the population was engaged in subsistence agriculture from ever- shrinking plots of land (due to an increasing rural population). Although some industrial activity was encouraged by state contracts and foreign investment, industrial development was slow and failed to create alternative employment opportunities for the overpopulated and impoverished countryside. Atop the low social pyramid stood a disproportionately powerful social elite, a remnant of the nobility that had once owned most of the land in the old kingdom. Although reforms between 1917 and 1921 had left them with only 15% of the arable land, this aristocracy retained a powerful voice in political affairs. Communist era (1947–1989) After World War II, Romania's social structure was drastically altered by the imposition of a political system envisioning a classless, egalitarian society. Marxist-Leninist doctrine holds that the establishment of a socialist state (in which the working class possesses the means of production and distribution of goods and political power) will ensure the eventual development of communism. Under communism, there would be no class conflict or exploitation of man by his fellow man. There would be an abundance of wealth, shared equally by all. The road to communism requires the primacy of the working class and the elimination of the ruling class and bourgeoisie. In Romania the latter was easily accomplished, but most of the population were peasants and not workers. The Communist government (imposed by the Soviet Union in 1945) eliminated opposition to their consolidation of power by appeals to the working class. Disruption caused by World War II assisted the new government; much of the ruling elite had either emigrated or been killed, and many survivors left with the retreating German forces as the Red Army approached. Most Jews (who had constituted a large segment of the communal and financial elite before the war) either died in fascist Romania or fled the country over the next few years. Measures taken during the early days of communist rule eradicated what remained of the upper crust. Land reforms in 1945 eliminated large holdings, depriving the aristocracy of their power and economic base. The currency reform of 1947 (which essentially confiscated all money for the state) was ruinous for members of the commercial and industrial bourgeoisie who had not fled with their fortunes. The state also expropriated commercial and industrial properties; by 1950 90% of all industrial output was state-controlled, and by 1953 only 14% of shops were privately owned. Although opposition from the more economically and socially advanced members of society was eliminated almost immediately, the task of creating an industrial working class (in whose name the communists claimed power) had just begun. In 1950, less than 25% of the population lived in cities or worked in factories. Conditions in the countryside, however, were poised for change in the direction the regime required. The war and Soviet occupation had left the peasantry starving, with much of their livestock and capital destroyed. Their problems were compounded by a drought in 1945–1946, followed by a famine in which thousands died. More important for the regime, many of the peasants became detached from the land and were willing to work in factory jobs resulting from the Communist Party's industrialization program.Library of Congress Country Studies, CIA Factbook. Retrieved 2011-04-12. Post-communism (1990–present) The difference between communism in theory and communism in practice was especially pronounced in Romania, whose anemic economy was beset by inefficiency. An economic crisis beginning in the 1970s snowballed throughout the 1980s, leading to a sharp decline in living standards. In December 1989, the government headed by Nicolae Ceaușescu was forcibly overthrown, with rioting in Bucharest. The sudden removal of a state- controlled economy led to further erosion in the standard of living, with unemployment and job insecurity.Romania – Political, Social and Economic Setting.

Early life and education Leichter was born in Vienna, Austria. He came to the United States as a refugee from German-occupied Europe in 1940 with his father and brother. His mother Käthe Leichter (1895–1942) was a leading sociologist and feminist. She was arrested by the Gestapo in 1938, sent to the Ravensbrück concentration camp and killed in 1942. The Government of Austria has conferred an annual Käthe Leichter Award in her honor since 1992. His father, Otto Leichter, died in New York City in 1973. His brother Henry O. Leichter, born 1924 in Austria, a lawyer, died in New York City in 2010. Franz has two children, Katherine and Joshua, and four grandchildren, Memphis, Ethan, Otto and Theo. Leichter attended New York City's public schools and graduated from Swarthmore College, magna cum laude, in 1952. He received his Doctor of Law from Harvard Law School in 1957 after serving in the U.S. Army in Japan. Public service=New York State Assembly= Franz S. Leichter, a Democrat, was first elected to the New York State Assembly in November 1968. He remained in the Assembly until 1974, sitting in the 178th, 179th and 180th New York State Legislatures. He drafted a bill expanding abortion rights together with Republican Assemblywoman Constance Cook of upstate Tompkins County, New York, proposing legislation that included no restrictions on the practice of abortion. The bill passed in the Senate on March 18, 1970 after five hours of debate by a vote of 31–26. For the Assembly, the bill was amended to allow for women to have abortions until their 24th week of pregnancy or at any time to protect the life of the mother. The Cook-Leichter bill was the first in the nation to legalize abortion. This law influenced the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in its landmark January 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. =New York State Senate= Leichter won election to the State Senate in 1974 after he defeated incumbent Senate Minority Leader Joseph Zaretzki in the Democratic primary. Leichter remained in the Senate until 1998, sitting in the 181st, 182nd, 183rd, 184th, 185th, 186th, 187th, 188th, 189th, 190th, 191st and 192nd New York State Legislatures. In the Legislature, Leichter was known as a maverick who fought for reform and effective ethical standards. For his outspoken criticism of how the Legislature operated, and his willingness to take on powerful interests such as New York City's banking and real estate industries, and the leadership of the Democratic and Republican parties, he was often referred to as \\"the conscience of the Senate\\". Leichter took on many causes. He introduced the New York City canine waste law, commonly known as the \\"pooper-scooper\\" law, which requires dog owners in New York City to clean up after their pets. Since its enactment in 1979, similar laws have been adopted throughout the country. Leichter was a strong consumer advocate. As ranking Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, he sought to advance the interests of consumers and to block harmful legislation. Among his major achievements was the law that required banks to promptly credit their customers with checks when deposited instead of holding the amounts for days while using the money for their own profit, the first such law in the country. A few years after New York State ended this practice, the United States Congress followed suit. For many years he issued a popular Consumer's Guide to Banks to help empower consumers with information on how to avoid excessive charges and hidden fees. He also published a similar Consumer's Guide to Credit Cards. He frequently called attention to hidden bank and credit card charges and other practices that were costly to consumers. Active in support of affordable housing, Leichter pushed the Legislature to pass the \\"warranty of habitability\\" to protect tenants from dangerous and unsanitary conditions. He was a leading advocate for tenants' rights and a vocal supporter of New York's rent regulations to protect affordable housing. Leichter fought for campaign finance reform and was credited with playing a key role in the establishment of New York City's campaign finance law. He was instrumental in abolishing wasteful and inefficient tax subsidies to businesses by New York State and New York City. Leichter was a major proponent of establishing parks and green space to provide community access to the Hudson River waterfront, both within New York City and in the Hudson valley. He co-authored with Assemblyman Richard Gottfried legislation that created Manhattan's Hudson River Park and led the effort that established Riverbank State Park in Harlem. The Hudson River Park now stretches from Battery Park City to 59th Street along the Hudson River. The park has replaced rotting piers and a derelict waterfront with acres of greenery, with areas for both quiet space and active recreational use that has brought thousands of New Yorkers and visitors back to the waterfront. The Riverbank State Park, which was built at Leichter's urging on top of a waste water treatment plant, stretches for ten blocks along Harlem's shore of the Hudson River. Riverbank is visited annually by more than 3 million people and is the third most-used State park in New York. In 1990, Leichter drafted and introduced the first state bill anywhere in the country providing for domestic partnerships, primarily to expand civil rights for lesbian and gay people in the absence of their right to marriage. While his bill did not pass it helped move to the forefront the effort to achieve equal rights for gays and lesbians. New York State adopted the same-sex marriage law in 2011. As a Democrat serving in the minority party his entire legislative career, Leichter described his strategy as \\"raising issues\\", which he accomplished through aggressive debate on the Senate floor, extensive research reports, and frequent news conferences in the Senate lobby and on the steps of New York City Hall. His districts covered portions of the western sides of Manhattan and the Bronx. His stands and independence resulted in the Democratic and Republican leadership twice reapportioning him so his home was outside his district. Both times he ran in newly structured districts to retain his seat. Leichter announced his retirement from the Senate in 1998 at age 67, and was succeeded by Eric Schneiderman, who went on to be elected as New York State Attorney General in 2010. In 2000 he was nominated by President Bill Clinton as a Director of the Federal Housing Finance Board (FHFB), which was the regulator of the Home Loan Bank System. Leichter began his service in August 2000 with a recess appointment from the President. He was then re- nominated by President George W. Bush and confirmed by the Senate. Leichter served until July 2006 when his term expired. Leichter was nominated in 2009 by Governor David Paterson to serve on New York State's Banking Board. He was confirmed by the Senate and served as a member until its elimination in 2011. =Practicing attorney= Leichter was a practicing attorney for 50 years, specializing in commercial litigation and in representing foreign clients. Among others, he represented Brazilian and Mexican Banks. He was associated with various law firms, including Wachtell Manheim & Grouf and until his service on the Federal Housing Finance Board with Walter Conston, Alexander & Green (now part of Alston & Bird).alston.com Leichter is a Director of the Hudson River Park Trust Board, which is constructing a park along the Hudson River in Manhattan, New York.

History and following Most of Big Finish Games' team were members of Access Software, a company known for its diverse lineup of games, including the popular Tex Murphy series of adventure games. When the company was purchased by Microsoft (and later 2K Games), their focus was narrowed to sports games and the company was renamed to Indie Built. After Indie Built was closed, they decided that \\"the time was right to take the plunge back into the adventure game genre\\". The company has hoped to target the enduring fan base of the Tex Murphy series, while also welcoming a more casual audience that is usually intimidated by adventure games. Conners has stated that in the longer term, Big Finish aim to develop story-based games in a number of genres. The company has also acquired the rights to the Tex Murphy series, and has expressed some intent to revive the character, stating his return is no longer \\"an 'if,' but a 'when.'\\" On March 20, 2012, Big Finish Games announced an upcoming Kickstarter campaign for Tex Murphy - Project Fedora. which was successfully funded on June 16.

It is a member of the Historic Houses Association. The house itself is a Grade II* listed building. The Hall was built for Sir Richard Hutton (1560–1639) after he acquired the Goldsborough Estate in 1598, and in the 20th century it was home to Princess Mary, Countess of Harewood as her first family home. The original building still stands and is occupied as a private family home. The Hall and gardens are open throughout the year to visitors wishing to experience fine dining or stay the night, as well as exclusive hire for weddings and functions. History The house was built from 1601 to 1625 for Sir Richard Hutton, a prominent lawyer in London, who became High Sheriff of Yorkshire in 1623. On his death, in 1639, the Hall passed to his son, also called Sir Richard Hutton. Sir Richard Hutton, the younger had been knighted by Charles I in 1625 and became one of two MPs for Knaresborough. He was High Sheriff of Yorkshire and Governor of Knaresborough Castle when the English Civil War broke out. During the Civil War, the house was forcibly occupied by Oliver Cromwell’s army in 1644 while they besieged Knaresborough Castle. Sir Richard Hutton, the younger fought at the battle of Marston Moor in 1644 and was killed at Sherburn-in-Elmet in 1645. The hall passed to the Wharton family when Sir Richard's daughter, Elizabeth, married the Hon Philip Wharton. Her sister married Colonel Anthony Byerley of Middridge Grange. Their son Robert Byerley married Elizabeth and Philip's daughter, Mary Wharton in 1695. Robert Byerley was MP for County Durham and represented Knaresborough nine times between 1697 and 1710. He was a soldier and fought at the Battle of Buda in 1686 and the Battle of the Boyne in 1690. The story goes that Robert Byerley captured a fine brown horse at the Battle of Buda, the Byerley Turk, which is the eldest founding father to all thoroughbred horses. The Byerley Turk was buried at the Hall in 1706. As Robert and Mary Byerley's five children all died without issue, the Hall was sold to Daniel Lascelles about 1756Nikolaus Pevsner, Enid Radcliffe Yorkshire: the West Riding 1968 Penguin and became part of the Harewood estate during the construction of Harewood House in the 1750s. The house was remodelled by John Carr and Robert Adam. The Hall remained within the Lascelles family for 200 years, being used as Dower House, the heirs-in- waiting house, a hunting lodge, or even rented out when not needed for the viscount, earl in waiting. In the late 19th century the hall was rented out to Sir Andrew Fairbairn, a Liberal MP, while he was building his country house at Askham Grange and the estate at Askham Richards. The Hall became the first family home of Mary, Princess Royal and Countess of Harewood and Viscount Lascelles, Henry Lascelles, 6th Earl of Harewood after their marriage in 1922. Their son, George Henry Hubert Lascelles, 7th Earl of Harewood was christened at the adjoining Goldsborough church on 25 March 1923, the service being attended by King George V and Queen Mary and presided over by Cosmo Lang, the Archbishop of York. The King and Queen visited their daughter and grandchildren George and Gerald Lascelles, and stayed at Goldsborough Hall on many occasions throughout the 1920s. During World War II, Oatlands School, Harrogate (now the site of St Aidan's School) was stationed at the Hall. The owners of the school, the Boyer family, bought Goldsborough Hall from the Harewood estate in 1951. The rest of the village was sold at auction in 1952, ending 1,000 years of the estate village. In 1966 the school closed and the Hanson family purchased the Hall and its land, reverting the Hall to a private house. Due to ill health, the Hansons had to sell the hall in 1977. It was sold to a Leeds-based developer, West and Sons, who further developed the Hall and, they, in turn sold the Hall to Mrs Elsie Sharpe-Day, who converted the building into a luxury country-house hotel that never opened. In 1979 the Hall was acquired by Russell Stansfield Smith, who lived in the house as his family home before converting it into a 60-resident, 40-bedroom nursing home that opened in 1983. The Hall became the flagship of a group of nursing homes called Goldsborough Estates. In 1997 BUPA acquired Goldsborough Estates and looked at ways to bring the Hall to meet with modern standards in nursing practice. Due to the historic nature of the building, it was considered to be impractical and the Hall closed as a nursing home in May 2003 and was subsequently advertised for sale. In 2005 the Hall was acquired by the Oglesby family who once more converted it back to a private family home. Goldsborough Hall today After being a nursing home for over 20 years and then empty for a further two years, the Hall required a vast amount of restoration and maintenance. The current owners have refurbished the main state rooms and second-floor bedrooms suites, in order to host private weddings, corporate functions and events along with luxury five star guest accommodation. The gardens, neglected for years, have been replanted in a Gertrude Jekyll style that befits their original creation in the time of Princess Mary. The gardens are open to the public for two days a year (March and July) under the National Gardens Scheme and two Snowdrop Days in February.

The terms path integral, curve integral, and curvilinear integral are also used; contour integral is used as well, although that is typically reserved for line integrals in the complex plane. The function to be integrated may be a scalar field or a vector field. The value of the line integral is the sum of values of the field at all points on the curve, weighted by some scalar function on the curve (commonly arc length or, for a vector field, the scalar product of the vector field with a differential vector in the curve). This weighting distinguishes the line integral from simpler integrals defined on intervals. Many simple formulae in physics, such as the definition of work as W=mathbf{F}cdotmathbf{s}, have natural continuous analogues in terms of line integrals, in this case textstyle W = int_L mathbf{F}(mathbf{s})cdot dmathbf{s}, which computes the work done on an object moving through an electric or gravitational field F along a path s.  Vector calculus  In qualitative terms, a line integral in vector calculus can be thought of as a measure of the total effect of a given tensor field along a given curve. For example, the line integral over a scalar field (rank 0 tensor) can be interpreted as the area under the field carved out by a particular curve. This can be visualized as the surface created by z = f(x,y) and a curve C in the xy plane. The line integral of f would be the area of the \\"curtain\\" created—when the points of the surface that are directly over C are carved out. = Line integral of a scalar field = The line integral over a scalar field f can be thought of as the area under the curve C along a surface z = f(x,y), described by the field.  Definition  For some scalar field f : mathbb{U} subseteq mathbb{R}^n rightarrow mathbb{R}, the line integral along a piecewise smooth curve mathcal{C} subset mathbb{U} is defined as :int_{mathcal{C}} f(mathbf{r}), ds = int_a^b fleft(mathbf{r}(t)right)mathbf{r}'(t) , dt. where mathbf{r} : [a,b] rightarrow mathcal{C} is an arbitrary bijective parametrization of the curve mathcal{C} such that mathbf{r}(a) and mathbf{r}(b) give the endpoints of mathcal{C} and a < b. Here, and in the rest of the article, the absolute value bars denote the standard (Euclidean) norm of a vector. The function f is called the integrand, the curve mathcal{C} is the domain of integration, and the symbol ds may be intuitively interpreted as an elementary arc length. Line integrals of scalar fields over a curve mathcal{C} do not depend on the chosen parametrization mathbf{r} of mathcal{C}. Geometrically, when the scalar field f is defined over a plane (n=2), its graph is a surface z=f(x,y) in space, and the line integral gives the (signed) cross-sectional area bounded by the curve mathcal{C} and the graph of f. See the animation to the right.  Derivation  For a line integral over a scalar field, the integral can be constructed from a Riemann sum using the above definitions of f, C and a parametrization r of C. This can be done by partitioning the interval [a,b] into n sub-intervals [ti-1, ti] of length Δt = (b − a)/n, then r(ti) denotes some point, call it a sample point, on the curve C. We can use the set of sample points {r(ti) : 1 ≤ i ≤ n} to approximate the curve C by a polygonal path by introducing a straight line piece between each of the sample points r(ti-1) and r(ti). We then label the distance between each of the sample points on the curve as Δsi. The product of f(r(ti)) and Δsi can be associated with the signed area of a rectangle with a height and width of f(r(ti)) and Δsi, respectively. Taking the limit of the sum of the terms as the length of the partitions approaches zero gives us :I = lim_{Delta s_i rightarrow 0} sum_{i=1}^n f(mathbf{r}(t_i)) , Delta s_i. By the mean value theorem, the distance between subsequent points on the curve, is :Delta s_i = mathbf{r}(t_i+Delta t)-mathbf{r}(t_i)approxmathbf{r}'(t_i) , Delta t. Substituting this in the above Riemann sum yields :I = lim_{Delta t rightarrow 0} sum_{i=1}^n f(mathbf{r}(t_i))mathbf{r}'(t_i) , Delta t which is the Riemann sum for the integral :I = int_a^b f(mathbf{r}(t)) mathbf{r}'(t), dt. = Line integral of a vector field = Definition  For a vector field F : U ⊆ Rn → Rn, the line integral along a piecewise smooth curve C ⊂ U, in the direction of r, is defined as :int_C mathbf{F}(mathbf{r})cdot,dmathbf{r} = int_a^b mathbf{F}(mathbf{r}(t))cdotmathbf{r}'(t),dt. where · is the dot product, and r: [a, b] → C is a bijective parametrization of the curve C such that r(a) and r(b) give the endpoints of C. A line integral of a scalar field is thus a line integral of a vector field, where the vectors are always tangential to the line. Line integrals of vector fields are independent of the parametrization r in absolute value, but they do depend on its orientation. Specifically, a reversal in the orientation of the parametrization changes the sign of the line integral. From the viewpoint of differential geometry, the line integral of a vector field along a curve is the integral of the corresponding 1-form under the musical isomorphism (which takes the vector field to the corresponding covector field), over the curve considered as an immersed 1-manifold.  Derivation  The trajectory of a particle (in red) along a curve inside a vector field. Starting from a, the particle traces the path C along the vector field F. The dot product (green line) of its tangent vector (red arrow) and the field vector (blue arrow) defines an area under a curve, which is equivalent to the path's line integral. (Click on image for a detailed description.) The line integral of a vector field can be derived in a manner very similar to the case of a scalar field, but this time with the inclusion of a dot product. Again using the above definitions of F, C and its parametrization r(t), we construct the integral from a Riemann sum. We partition the interval [a,b] (which is the range of the values of the parameter t) into n intervals of length Δt = (b − a)/n. Letting ti be the ith point on [a,b], then r(ti) gives us the position of the ith point on the curve. However, instead of calculating up the distances between subsequent points, we need to calculate their displacement vectors, Δri. As before, evaluating F at all the points on the curve and taking the dot product with each displacement vector gives us the infinitesimal contribution of each partition of F on C. Letting the size of the partitions go to zero gives us a sum :I = lim_{Delta t rightarrow 0} sum_{i=1}^n mathbf{F}(mathbf{r}(t_i)) cdot Deltamathbf{r}_i By the mean value theorem, we see that the displacement vector between adjacent points on the curve is :Deltamathbf{r}_i = mathbf{r}(t_i + Delta t)-mathbf{r}(t_i) approx mathbf{r}'(t_i) ,Delta t. Substituting this in the above Riemann sum yields :I = lim_{Delta t rightarrow 0} sum_{i=1}^n mathbf{F}(mathbf{r}(t_i)) cdot mathbf{r}'(t_i),Delta t, which is the Riemann sum for the integral defined above. = Path independence = If a vector field F is the gradient of a scalar field G (i.e. if F is conservative), that is, :mathbf{F} = abla G , then the derivative of the composition of G and r(t) is :frac{dG(mathbf{r}(t))}{dt} = abla G(mathbf{r}(t)) cdot mathbf{r}'(t) = mathbf{F}(mathbf{r}(t)) cdot mathbf{r}'(t) which happens to be the integrand for the line integral of F on r(t). It follows, given a path C , that :int_C mathbf{F}(mathbf{r})cdot,dmathbf{r} = int_a^b mathbf{F}(mathbf{r}(t))cdotmathbf{r}'(t),dt = int_a^b frac{dG(mathbf{r}(t))}{dt},dt = G(mathbf{r}(b)) - G(mathbf{r}(a)). In other words, the integral of F over C depends solely on the values of G at the points r(b) and r(a), and is thus independent of the path between them. For this reason, a line integral of a conservative vector field is called path independent. = Applications = The line integral has many uses in physics. For example, the work done on a particle traveling on a curve C inside a force field represented as a vector field F is the line integral of F on C.  Flow across a curve  For a vector field mathbf{F}:Usubsetmathbb{R}^2tomathbb{R}^2, mathbf{F}(x,y) = (P(x,y), Q(x,y)) , the line integral across a curve C ⊂ U, also called the flux integral, is defined in terms of a piecewise smooth parametrization mathbf{r}colon [a,b]to C, mathbf{r}(t) = (x(t), y(t)), as: :int_C mathbf{F}(mathbf{r}) cdot dmathbf{r}^perp = int_a^b (P(x(t),y(t)), Q(x(t),y(t)) ) cdot (y'(t), -x'(t)) ,dt = int_a^b -Q, dx + P , dy . Here • is the dot product, and mathbf{r}'(t)^perp = (y'(t),-x'(t)) is the clockwise perpendicular of the velocity vector mathbf{r}'(t)=(x'(t),y'(t)). The flow is computed in an oriented sense: the curve C has a specified forward direction from r(a) to r(b), and the flow is counted as positive when mathbf{F}(mathbf{r}(t)) is on the clockwise side of the forward velocity vector mathbf{r}'(t).  Complex line integral  In complex analysis, the line integral is defined in terms of multiplication and addition of complex numbers. Suppose U is an open subset of the complex plane C, f : U → C is a function, and Lsubset U is a curve of finite length, parametrized by gamma : [a,b] to L, where gamma(t)=x(t)+iy(t). The line integral :int_L f(z),dz may be defined by subdividing the interval [a, b] into a = t0 < t1 < ... < tn = b and considering the expression :sum_{k=1}^{n} f(gamma(t_k)) ,[ gamma(t_k) - gamma(t_{k-1}) ] = sum_{k=1}^{n} f(gamma_k) ,Deltagamma_k. The integral is then the limit of this Riemann sum as the lengths of the subdivision intervals approach zero. If the parametrization gamma is continuously differentiable, the line integral can be evaluated as an integral of a function of a real variable: :int_L f(z),dz = int_a^b f(gamma(t)) gamma'(t),dt. When L is a closed curve (initial and final points coincide), the line integral is often denoted textstyle oint_L f(z),dz, sometimes referred to in engineering as a cyclic integral. The line integral with respect to the conjugate complex differential overline{dz} is defined to be :int_L f(z) overline{dz} := overline{int_L overline{f(z)} ,dz} = int_a^b f(gamma(t)) overline{gamma'(t)},dt. The line integrals of complex functions can be evaluated using a number of techniques. The most direct is to split into real and imaginary parts, reducing the problem to evaluating two real-valued line integrals. The Cauchy integral theorem may be used to equate the line integral of an analytic function to the same integral over a more convenient curve. It also implies that over a closed curve enclosing a region where f(z) is analytic without singularities, the value of the integral is simply zero, or in case the region includes singularities, the residue theorem computes the integral in terms of the singularities. = Example = Consider the function f(z) = 1/z, and let the contour L be the counterclockwise unit circle about 0, parametrized by z(t) = eit with t in [0, 2π] using the complex exponential. Substituting, we find: :begin{align} oint_L frac {1}{z},dz &= int_0^{2pi} frac{1}{e^{it}} ie^{it} ,dt = iint_0^{2pi} e^{-it}e^{it},dt  &= i int_0^{2pi} dt = i(2pi-0)= 2pi i. end{align} This is a typical result of Cauchy's integral formula and the residue theorem. = Relation of complex line integral and line integral of vector field = Viewing complex numbers as 2-dimensional vectors, the line integral of a complex-valued function f(z) has real and complex parts equal to the line integral and the flux integral of the vector field corresponding to the conjugate function overline{f(z)}. Specifically, if mathbf{r} (t) = (x(t), y(t)) parametrizes L, and f(z)=u(z)+iv(z) corresponds to the vector field mathbf{F}(x,y) = overline{f(x + iy)} = (u(x + iy), -v(x + iy)), then: :begin{align} int_L f(z),dz &= int_L (u+iv)(dx+i,dy)  &= int_L (u,-v)cdot (dx,dy) + iint_L (u,-v)cdot (dy,-dx)  &= int_L mathbf{F}(mathbf{r})cdot dmathbf{r} + iint_L mathbf{F}(mathbf{r})cdot dmathbf{r}^perp. end{align} By Cauchy's theorem, the left-hand integral is zero when f(z) is analytic (satisfying the Cauchy–Riemann equations). Correspondingly, by Green's theorem, the right-hand integrals are zero when mathbf{F} = overline{f(z)} is irrotational (curl-free) and incompressible (divergence- free). In fact, the Cauchy-Riemann equations for f(z) are identical to the vanishing of curl and divergence for F. By Green's theorem, the area of a region enclosed by a smooth, closed, positively oriented curve L is given by the integral textstylefrac{1}{2i} int_L overline{z} , dz. This fact is used, for example, in the proof of the area theorem.  Quantum mechanics  The path integral formulation of quantum mechanics actually refers not to path integrals in this sense but to functional integrals, that is, integrals over a space of paths, of a function of a possible path. However, path integrals in the sense of this article are important in quantum mechanics; for example, complex contour integration is often used in evaluating probability amplitudes in quantum scattering theory.

This force acts on water independently of the wind stress. This force is named after Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis and George Gabriel Stokes, two nineteenth-century scientists. Important initial studies into the effects of the Earth's rotation on the wave motion – and the resulting forcing effects on the mean ocean circulation – were done by , and . The Coriolis–Stokes forcing on the mean circulation in an Eulerian reference frame was first given by : :rhoboldsymbol{f}timesboldsymbol{u}_S, to be added to the common Coriolis forcing rhoboldsymbol{f}timesboldsymbol{u}.

Further rho is the fluid density, times is the cross product operator, boldsymbol{f}=fhat{boldsymbol{z}} where f=2Omegasinphi is the Coriolis parameter (with Omega the Earth's rotation angular speed and sinphi the sine of the latitude) and hat{boldsymbol{z}} is the unit vector in the vertical upward direction (opposing the Earth's gravity).

It was formed on 1 January 2009 when Saint-Germain-Source-Seine was merged with Blessey. Its demonym is Sequanien (masculine/mixed plural) or Sequanienne (feminine), most likely named after Sequana, the goddess of the river Seine. Geography Source-Seine is located northwest of Dijon. There are two hameaux or hamlets in Source-Seine : Saint-Germain (originally Saint-Germain- Source-Seine), and Blessey. True to its name, within Source-Seine is the source of the Seine, in woods off the D103 road approximately 2 km Southeast by east of the cluster of buildings in Saint-Germain, or 3 km East by south of the cluster of buildings in Blessey. The Seine rises at an elevation of in this wooded area, from waters in several closely clustered ditches/depressions. France's second-longest river (after the Loire), the Seine then flows before it passes between the coastal communes of Le Havre and Honfleur, on the Normandy coast, into the English Channel. Source-Seine borders the communes of Frôlois to the north-west, Chanceaux to the north, Poncey-sur-l'Ignon to the north-east, Bligny-le-Sec to the south-east, Salmaise to the south and Boux-sous-Salmaise to the south-west. History What is now Source-Seine saw Gaulic pilgrimage beginning in the 1st century BC. In the late 4th century AD, Roman Emperor Theodosius I ordered the closure of pagan temples at the Seine's source and gave their property to Christian institutions. In accordance with this edict, in the 5th century the abbey of Sainte-Marie-de-Cestra, the closest religious institution to the Seine's source, received a donation from the Roman government. In the 17th century, rumors of healing powers in the Seine were circulating around Paris. This led to the construction of a grotto dedicated to the Seine Nymph and financed by its residents in the 19th century. The city of Paris officially bought the source of the Seine in 1864. Modern times have seen a wave of coin throwers flocking to the river's source. The commune of Source-Seine was formed on 1 January 2009 when Saint-Germain-Source-Seine was fused with Blessey. =Name history= A sign at the entrance to the town, displaying the incorrect name originally used The name Source-Seine originated during the French Revolution when the ruling of 22 frimaire of year II of the French First Republic (12 December 1793) stipulated that a commune could not be named after a saint or contain any religious references.ROSEROT (Alphonse) Dictionnaire topographique du département de La Côte-d'Or (1924), p. 348. As a result, the name of Saint- Germain-Source-Seine (which was then called Sainct Germain la Fæuille or Saint-Germain-la-Feuille) was changed to Source-Seine. The municipal order stated that 'the name of the commune of Saint-Germain-la-Feuille will change to the name of Source-Seine, taking this name from the way the Seine river has its source on the territory of the commune.' Saint-Germain-Source-Seine was renamed Saint-Germain-la-Feuille in 1815 during the Bourbon Restoration. In 1868, the town council requested that the words 'la-Feuille' be replaced by 'Source-Seine', which they were following a decree by President MacMahon on 22 July 1875. The name Source-Seine was revived when Saint-Germain-Source-Seine was merged with Blessey. After Saint-Germain-Source-Seine and Blessey merged, following a local consultation, the prefectoral decree and the Journal Officiel de la République Française referred to the commune as Source Seine JORF number 0028 of the 3rd February 2009, page 1946, text number 6 (without a hyphen), which was against the rules regarding the naming of political and administrative entities. The JORF quickly corrected the name and changed it to Source-SeineJournal Officiel de la République française, JO n° 0011 of the 14/05/2009, and the Code officiel géographique followed.

Sister towns * Verghereto (Italy) since 2002. The commune of Saint-Germain-Source-Seine signed a 'Charte d'amitié' (friendship charter) with the commune of Verghereto in 2001 and a sister town agreement in 2002. The commune of Source-Seine has been twinned with Verghereto since the fusion of the two communes. The source of the Tiber, the river that passes through Rome (which is a sister city of Paris) is located in Verghereto. The partnership is therefore between two communes which contain the sources of rivers that traverse European capital cities.

Plot A group of Greek youngster in the early 1960s, lead their lives ignoring their parents. Three of them are: Rea (Zoe Laskari), whose parents do not pay much attention to the carefree way of life she leads, Costas (Nikos Kourkoulos), Rea's boyfriend, who comes from a broken home and is secretly engaging in love affairs with other girls and Petros (Vangelis Voulgaridis), who is a kind and gentle person and is also in love with Rea. Their main concern is the same as most of the 1960s youngsters, i.e. going to parties where we can see the decadent way in which they have fun (passionate dancing, kissing, striptease etc.). A few days later, Rea learns about Costas' promiscuous life, dumps him and decides to have an affair with Petros. Costas, in order to get his revenge, arranges a meeting in a park where he abandons her naked. After humiliating her like that, he has an affair with her sister, Lena (Mirka Kalantzopoulou). Rea gets furious and wanting to protect her sister from that evil person, kills him. She is led to court, where her attorney is her own father, and after a very long trial, Lena reveals the true reason the crime took place, an action that helps Rea get a lighter sentence.http://www.cinehellas.com/tainies/1961/kathforos/kathforos.htmlhttp://www.ishow.gr/productionSynopsis.asp?guid=BE0B603F-EF17-4E22-919E-66823FEB5999 Cast *Zoe Laskari ....

Michaels (September 15, 1910 - December 3, 1992) was an American Democratic Party politician from New York, who served in the New York State Assembly from 1961 to 1966 and 1969 to 1970, where he was best known for his changed vote that played a pivotal role in the passage of an expanded abortion rights law in New York State. Biography=Early life= Michaels was born on September 15, 1910 (as per the Social Security Death Index) in College Point, Queens, New York City. He attended Cornell University, and graduated from Brooklyn Law School. Then he practiced law in Auburn, Cayuga County, New York. He served in the United States Marine Corps during World War II, enlisting as a private and leaving as a captain.Saxon, Wolfgang. \\"George Michaels, 80, Legislator Who Changed Abortion Law, Dies \\", The New York Times, December 5, 1992. Accessed January 24, 2009. He was a member of the New York State Assembly from 1961 to 1966, sitting in the 173rd, 174th, 175th and 176th New York State Legislatures. In 1966, the new apportionment joined Cayuga and Cortland counties into the 122nd District, and Michaels declined to run for re-election.Slayton Leaves Business To Campaign For Folmer Post in The Cortland Democrat, of Cortland, on October 13, 1966 Michaels was again a member of the State Assembly in 1969 and 1970. In the Assembly he was an advocate for expanded state aid to rural school districts and in sentencing and prison issues. He was the sponsor of the 1970 bill that made the bluebird the official state bird of New York.Kinkead, Eugene. \\"A Rumor in the Air: The Story of the New York State Bird\\" , New York State Bluebird Society. Accessed January 24, 2009. =New York's abortion law= Michaels supported what he saw as a woman's right to choose to have an abortion on a personal basis. At the request of the Cayuga County Democratic Committee he had voted twice against efforts to loosen restrictions, including an early April 1970 effort that was narrowly defeated. Franz Leichter, a Democratic Assemblyman from Manhattan drafted a bill expanding abortion rights together with Republican Assemblywoman Constance Cook of upstate Tompkins County, New York, proposing legislation that included no restrictions on the practice of abortion. The bill passed in the Senate on March 18, 1970, after five hours of debate by a vote of 31-26. For the Assembly, the bill was amended to allow for women to have abortions until their 24th week of pregnancy or at any time to protect the life of the mother. As the roll call progressed in the Assembly on April 9, 1970, the legislature deadlocked at 74 in favor and 74 opposed, with the Assembly speaker not voting in a case when it did not make a difference, leaving the count two short of the absolute majority of 76 members of the 150-member Assembly needed to pass the bill.Perez-Pena, Richard. \\"'70 Abortion Law: New York Said Yes, Stunning the Nation\\", The New York Times, April 9, 2000. Accessed January 24, 2009. Michaels had earlier voted against the proposal during the roll call, but rose to speak before the Clerk of the Assembly could close the vote and bring it to defeat. Those assembled in the galleries were unsure of his purpose, but he alluded to his intentions when he said that his constituents were going to \\"condemn me for what I am about to do\\". He continued with his speech, stating \\"I realize, Mr. Speaker, that I am terminating my political career, but I cannot in good conscience sit here and allow my vote to be the one that defeats this bill ... [and asked] that my vote be changed from \\"no\\" to \\"yes\\"\\". His prediction regarding his political future turned out to be accurate.Saxon, Wolfgang. \\"George Michaels, 80, Legislator Who Changed Abortion Law, Dies\\", The New York Times, December 5, 1992. Accessed January 24, 2009. In explaining his change of heart, Michaels stated that \\"One of my sons just called me a whore for the vote I cast against this\\" and that another son had insisted: \\"Dad, for God's sake, don't let your vote be the vote that defeats this bill.\\" After his changed vote, the chamber erupted in bedlam, Michaels buried his face in his hands, and one person shouted epithets at him. With the switch by Michaels, the vote stood 75 to 73, and the Speaker was called to vote, this being a case when the speaker's vote would directly influence the result. Speaker Perry Duryea voted also for the law, and it passed by a vote of 76 to 73 in the Assembly. Governor Nelson Rockefeller signed the law the next day and the U.S. Supreme Court patterned its ruling in its landmark January 1973 decision Roe v. Wade on the New York law.Hevesi, Dennis. \\"Constance E. Cook, 89, Who Wrote Abortion Law, Is Dead\\", The New York Times, January 24, 2009. Accessed January 24, 2009.

In 1879 the Manhattan Railway Company acquired this station as well as all south-to-north lines in Manhattan, and by July 1, 1880 they added a spur east along 34th Street to the 34th Street Ferry Terminal, which connected commuters to railroad station and ferry terminal in Long Island City. The next stop to the north was 42nd Street. The next stop to the south was 28th Street. Eastbound on the shuttle, the next stop was Second Avenue. The shuttle platform was closed on July 14, 1930, five years after ferry service was ended by the Long Island Rail Road. This station closed entirely on May 12, 1955, with the ending of all service on the Third Avenue El south of 149th Street.NYCTA Notice of Third Avenue Rail Closure for May 12, 1955 References IRT Third Avenue Line stations Railway stations in the United States opened in 1878 Railway stations closed in 1955 1878 establishments in New York (state) 1955 disestablishments in New York (state) Former elevated and subway stations in Manhattan Defunct New York City Subway stations located aboveground Third Avenue 34th Street (Manhattan) ","title":"34th Street station (IRT Third Avenue Line)"},{"id":"21245707","text":"A red giant is a luminous giant star of low or intermediate mass (roughly 0.3–8 solar masses ()) in a late phase of stellar evolution. The outer atmosphere is inflated and tenuous, making the radius large and the surface temperature around or lower. The appearance of the red giant is from yellow- orange to red, including the spectral types K and M, but also class S stars and most carbon stars. Red giants differ in a way by which they generate energy: * most common red giants are stars on the red-giant branch (RGB) that are still fusing hydrogen into helium in a shell surrounding an inert helium core * red-clump stars in the cool half of the horizontal branch, fusing helium into carbon in their cores via the triple-alpha process * asymptotic- giant-branch (AGB) stars with a helium burning shell outside a degenerate carbon–oxygen core, and a hydrogen-burning shell just beyond that. Many of the well-known bright stars are red giants, because they are luminous and moderately common. The K0 RGB star Arcturus is 36 light-years away, and Gamma Crucis is the nearest M-class giant at 88 light-years' distance. Characteristics Mira, a variable asymptotic giant branch red giant A red giant is a star that has exhausted the supply of hydrogen in its core and has begun thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen in a shell surrounding the core. They have radii tens to hundreds of times larger than that of the Sun. However, their outer envelope is lower in temperature, giving them a reddish-orange hue. Despite the lower energy density of their envelope, red giants are many times more luminous than the Sun because of their great size. Red-giant-branch stars have luminosities up to nearly three thousand times that of the Sun (), spectral types of K or M, have surface temperatures of 3,000–4,000 K, and radii up to about 200 times the Sun (). Stars on the horizontal branch are hotter, with only a small range of luminosities around . Asymptotic-giant- branch stars range from similar luminosities as the brighter stars of the red- giant branch, up to several times more luminous at the end of the thermal pulsing phase. Among the asymptotic-giant-branch stars belong the carbon stars of type C-N and late C-R, produced when carbon and other elements are convected to the surface in what is called a dredge-up. The first dredge-up occurs during hydrogen shell burning on the red-giant branch, but does not produce a large carbon abundance at the surface. The second, and sometimes third, dredge up occurs during helium shell burning on the asymptotic-giant branch and convects carbon to the surface in sufficiently massive stars. The stellar limb of a red giant is not sharply defined, contrary to their depiction in many illustrations. Rather, due to the very low mass density of the envelope, such stars lack a well-defined photosphere, and the body of the star gradually transitions into a 'corona'. The coolest red giants have complex spectra, with molecular lines, emission features, and sometimes masers, particularly from thermally pulsing AGB stars. Observations have also provided evidence of a hot chromosphere above the photosphere of red giants, where investigating the heating mechanisms for the chromospheres to form requires 3D simulations of red giants. Another noteworthy feature of red giants is that, unlike Sun-like stars whose photospheres have a large number of small convection cells (solar granules), red-giant photospheres, as well as those of red supergiants, have just a few large cells, the features of which cause the variations of brightness so common on both types of stars. Evolution This image tracks the life of a Sun-like star, from its birth on the left side of the frame to its evolution into a red giant on the right after billions of years Red giants are evolved from main-sequence stars with masses in the range from about to around . When a star initially forms from a collapsing molecular cloud in the interstellar medium, it contains primarily hydrogen and helium, with trace amounts of \\"metals\\" (in stellar structure, this simply refers to any element that is not hydrogen or helium i.e. atomic number greater than 2). These elements are all uniformly mixed throughout the star. The star reaches the main sequence when the core reaches a temperature high enough to begin fusing hydrogen (a few million kelvin) and establishes hydrostatic equilibrium. Over its main sequence life, the star slowly converts the hydrogen in the core into helium; its main-sequence life ends when nearly all the hydrogen in the core has been fused. For the Sun, the main-sequence lifetime is approximately 10 billion years. More-massive stars burn disproportionately faster and so have a shorter lifetime than less massive stars. When the star exhausts the hydrogen fuel in its core, nuclear reactions can no longer continue and so the core begins to contract due to its own gravity. This brings additional hydrogen into a zone where the temperature and pressure are sufficient to cause fusion to resume in a shell around the core. The hydrogen-burning shell results in a situation that has been described as the mirror principle; when the core within the shell contracts, the layers of the star outside the shell must expand. The detailed physical processes that cause this are complex, but the behaviour is necessary to satisfy simultaneous conservation of gravitational and thermal energy in a star with the shell structure. The core contracts and heats up due to the lack of fusion, and so the outer layers of the star expand greatly, absorbing most of the extra energy from shell fusion. This process of cooling and expanding is the subgiant star. When the envelope of the star cools sufficiently it becomes convective, the star stops expanding, its luminosity starts to increase, and the star is ascending the red-giant branch of the Hertzsprung–Russell (H–R) diagram. Mira A is an old star, already shedding its outer layers into space The evolutionary path the star takes as it moves along the red-giant branch depends on the mass of the star. For the Sun and stars of less than about the core will become dense enough that electron degeneracy pressure will prevent it from collapsing further. Once the core is degenerate, it will continue to heat until it reaches a temperature of roughly 108 K, hot enough to begin fusing helium to carbon via the triple-alpha process. Once the degenerate core reaches this temperature, the entire core will begin helium fusion nearly simultaneously in a so-called helium flash. In more-massive stars, the collapsing core will reach 108 K before it is dense enough to be degenerate, so helium fusion will begin much more smoothly, and produce no helium flash. The core helium fusing phase of a star's life is called the horizontal branch in metal-poor stars, so named because these stars lie on a nearly horizontal line in the H–R diagram of many star clusters. Metal-rich helium-fusing stars instead lie on the so-called red clump in the H–R diagram. An analogous process occurs when the central helium is exhausted and the star collapses once again, causing helium in a shell to begin fusing. At the same time hydrogen may begin fusion in a shell just outside the burning helium shell. This puts the star onto the asymptotic giant branch, a second red-giant phase. The helium fusion results in the build up of a carbon–oxygen core. A star below about will never start fusion in its degenerate carbon–oxygen core. Instead, at the end of the asymptotic-giant-branch phase the star will eject its outer layers, forming a planetary nebula with the core of the star exposed, ultimately becoming a white dwarf. The ejection of the outer mass and the creation of a planetary nebula finally ends the red-giant phase of the star's evolution. The red-giant phase typically lasts only around a billion years in total for a solar mass star, almost all of which is spent on the red- giant branch. The horizontal-branch and asymptotic-giant-branch phases proceed tens of times faster. If the star has about 0.2 to , it is massive enough to become a red giant but does not have enough mass to initiate the fusion of helium. These \\"intermediate\\" stars cool somewhat and increase their luminosity but never achieve the tip of the red-giant branch and helium core flash. When the ascent of the red-giant branch ends they puff off their outer layers much like a post-asymptotic-giant-branch star and then become a white dwarf. =Stars that do not become red giants= Very-low-mass stars are fully convective and may continue to fuse hydrogen into helium for up to a trillion years until only a small fraction of the entire star is hydrogen. Luminosity and temperature steadily increase during this time, just as for more-massive main-sequence stars, but the length of time involved means that the temperature eventually increases by about 50% and the luminosity by around 10 times. Eventually the level of helium increases to the point where the star ceases to be fully convective and the remaining hydrogen locked in the core is consumed in only a few billion more years. Depending on mass, the temperature and luminosity continue to increase for a time during hydrogen shell burning, the star can become hotter than the Sun and tens of times more luminous than when it formed although still not as luminous as the Sun. After some billions more years, they start to become less luminous and cooler even though hydrogen shell burning continues. These become cool helium white dwarfs. Very-high-mass stars develop into supergiants that follow an evolutionary track that takes them back and forth horizontally over the H–R diagram, at the right end constituting red supergiants. These usually end their life as a type II supernova. The most massive stars can become Wolf–Rayet stars without becoming giants or supergiants at all. Planets Red giants with known planets: the M-type HD 208527, HD 220074 and, as of February 2014, a few tenshttp://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/ExoTables/nph- exotbls?dataset=planets of known K-giants including Pollux, Gamma Cephei and Iota Draconis. =Prospects for habitability= Although traditionally it has been suggested the evolution of a star into a red giant will render its planetary system, if present, uninhabitable, some research suggests that, during the evolution of a star along the red-giant branch, it could harbor a habitable zone for several billion years at 2 astronomical units (AU) out to around 100 million years at 9 AU out, giving perhaps enough time for life to develop on a suitable world. After the red-giant stage, there would for such a star be a habitable zone between 7 and 22 AU for an additional one billion years. Later studies have refined this scenario, showing how for a star the habitable zone lasts from 100 million years for a planet with an orbit similar to that of Mars to 210 million years for one that orbits at Saturn's distance to the Sun, the maximum time (370 million years) corresponding for planets orbiting at the distance of Jupiter. However, for planets orbiting a star in equivalent orbits to those of Jupiter and Saturn they would be in the habitable zone for 5.8 billion years and 2.1 billion years, respectively; for stars more massive than the Sun, the times are considerably shorter. =Enlargement of planets= As of June 2014, fifty giant planets have been discovered around giant stars. However, these giant planets are more massive than the giant planets found around solar-type stars. This could be because giant stars are more massive than the Sun (less massive stars will still be on the main sequence and will not have become giants yet) and more massive stars are expected to have more massive planets. However, the masses of the planets that have been found around giant stars do not correlate with the masses of the stars; therefore, the planets could be growing in mass during the stars' red giant phase. The growth in planet mass could be partly due to accretion from stellar wind, although a much larger effect would be Roche lobe overflow causing mass-transfer from the star to the planet when the giant expands out to the orbital distance of the planet. Well known examples Many of the well-known bright stars are red giants, because they are luminous and moderately common. The red-giant branch variable star Gamma Crucis is the nearest M-class giant star at 88 light-years. The K0 red-giant branch star Arcturus is 36 light-years away. =Red-giant branch= * Aldebaran (α Tauri) * Arcturus (α Bootis) * Gacrux (γ Crucis) =Red-clump giants= * Hamal (α Arietis) * κ Persei * δ Andromedae =Asymptotic giant branch= * Mira (ο Ceti) * χ Cygni * α Herculis The Sun as a red giant The current size of the Sun (now in the main sequence) compared to its estimated maximum size during its red-giant phase in the future The Sun will exit the main sequence in approximately 5 billion years and start to turn into a red giant. As a red giant, the Sun will grow so large that it will engulf Mercury, Venus, and probably Earth.

He came from a noble family originating in the Apulian town of Barletta and was a son of Marijan and Nikolica. He attended a humanist school in his town of birth and he studied law in Padua. In 1530, as a lesser nobleman he accepted the responsibilities of a Hvar defensor. In the same year, he became a Korčulan Notary and, at the end of 1538, he made his return to Hvar. On 5 February 1548, Pelegrinović was elected as a chancellor in the Zadar council. He travelled twice to Venice, in 1556 and 1557, probably to publish Jeđupka or his other works. It was at that time that he met Livija Martinušević, whom he married in 1558 and with whom he had a daughter, Julija, and a son, Julije. He lived in Zadar until his death.

However, from the preserved writings of his contemporaries (Nikola Nalješković, Mavro Vetranović, Petar Hektorović etc.) we know that Pelegrinović had written much more literary material. In 1525, the historian Vinko Pribojević mentioned Pelegrinović in his speech on the origin of Croats, when speaking of famous poets.

Alternate layers of minerals. Metamorphism where minerals are stretched, mashed and re-arranged in foliated textures. Feldspar and quartz are light layers with ferromagnesian minerals.The geology of Saskatchewan can be divided into two main geological regions, the Precambrian Canadian Shield and the Phanerozoic Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin. Within the Precambrian shield exists the Athabasca sedimentary basin. Meteorite impacts have altered the natural geological formation processes. The prairies were most recently affected by glacial events in the Quaternary period. Canadian Shield Canadian shield The Canadian shield, Precambrian shield, makes up the bedrock geology highlighted by rocks and lakes and a boreal forest area. There are transitional areas between boreal and tundra flora. The lower boundary of the Canadian Shield cuts across the province diagonally from the latitude 57 degrees in the north west to 54 degrees in the south east. Three orogenies formed the Precambrian shield, the Kenoran (Laurentian-Algoman), Hudsonian (Penokean) and Grenville Orogeny. Kenoran (Algoman) orogeny Kenoran (Algoman) orogeny Between 2.2 and 2.5 billion years ago was the Kenoran Orogeny, which was overlain by the Hudsonian Orogeny 1700 to 1900 million years ago. The earth was experiencing hotter and more volatile Archean tectonics, evidencing island arc volcanic activity and mountain building. Kenoran (Algoman) orogeny Kenoran (Algoman) orogeny Kenoran (Algoman) orogenyKenoran (Algoman) orogenyHudsonian Orogeny The Trans-Hudson Orogen occurred when a number of Archean continental blocks came together, including the Superior Craton from the southeast and Hearne-Rae craton from the northwest. A microcontinent named the Sask Craton was underlain in this collision zone. The Canadian Grenville province occurred between 1080 and 980 Ma and did not affect the geology of the Canadian Shield in Saskatchewan. The Grenvillian Orogeny deformed much of eastern Canada, and includes the Grenville Front Tectonic Zone in Quebec and Labrador, the Appalachian structural front to the south between what we now name the Great Lakes and Newfoundland. The Flin Flon greenstone belt, also referred to as the Flin Flon-Snow Lake greenstone belt, is a Precambrian greenstone belt located in the central area of Manitoba and east-central Saskatchewan, Canada. It lies in the central portion of the Trans-Hudson Orogeny and was formed by arc volcanism during the Paleoproterozoic Era. =Athabasca basin= The Athabasca basin, a historical fluvial siliciclastic basin with sediments from the Hudsonian mountains with the occasional rare marine sequence. The Athabasca basin was formed during the Statherian or Paleohelikian 1.7 to 1.6 billion years ago when coarse fluvial and marine clastic sediments were laid down containing gold, copper, lead, zinc, and uranium oxides. The highest grade uranium deposits in the world are found at the unconformity between these clastic layers and the Precambrian bedrock. The Athabasca Sand Hills protected by The Athabasca Sand Dunes Provincial Park are unique feature of the Canadian Shield. The hills are located in northern Saskatchewan and border Lake Athabasca, which straddles the Alberta and Saskatchewan border. Phanerozoic Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin There were three depositional stages for the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin which were dependent on plate tectonics of the era. Present-day North America was identified to lay upon the Proterozoic super-continent, Rodinia.Laurentia, also called the North American craton. This continent broke apart about 700 million years ago and formed other continents, one of which was Laurentia or the North American Craton. Laurentia drifted south of the equatorial zone. As this new smaller continent was smaller than Rodinia, it had some surface area under water level, including area designated as the Phanerozoic basin. Cambrian 544-505 Ma to Mississippian 362-320 Ma period laid down base clastics, then platform carbonates and evaporites. These deposits form the origins of potash evaporites for the potash industry. Laurentia began to rise at the close of the Cambrian Period. Huge flooding occurred during the Middle Ordovician period 505-441 Ma. Laurentia had shifted again, and the region of Saskatchewan was now north of the equator and some raising exposing the land again. Re- flooding in the Late Ordovician age with warm water increased calcium carbonate sedimentation, and marine life. Williston basin outlined. Canadian shield is red. Phanerozoic basin is greenish yellow.The Williston basin was formed creating a lowered land area during this period filling with the Winnipeg Sea. The Williston basin was mainly south of Saskatchewan but extended north into the Saskatchewan plains area. Laurasia was created near the end of the Silurian Period. Laurasia was formed from the joining of Laurentia with Gondwana and two smaller continents which had broken off Rodinia. The orogeny between Laurasia and Gondwana created the Appalachian Mountains, and an exodus of water from the Laurasian land surface. In the early Devonian Period 418-361 Ma, Laurasia separated from Gondwana, creating a depressions or land separations through the continent. One low-lying area occurred along the edge between the Cambrian shield and the Phanerozoic basin, the other trough lay along southwestern Saskatchewan extending east and west along the plains areas we know today. The Saskatchewan region was again south of the equator and under water, with reefs forming. A major barrier reef formed in the area now known as British Columbia, creating higher salinity levels east of the reef. Calcium carbonate, halite, gypsum, and potash were evaporite deposits. The Antler orogeny on the southwest coast of Laurasia caused upheavals. Following this orogeny, during the Carboniferous Period in the Mississippian epoch 362-320 Ma the Williston Basin again subsided and the area of the Phanerozoic basin was again mainly under tropical marine water. Oil production of southeastern Saskatchewan emerges mainly from Mississippian rocks. Animated map from Pangaea to presentDuring the Pennsylvanian epoch 320-286 Ma of the Carboniferous period, Laurasia joined with Gondwana to become Pangea. This supercontinent rose above sea level, in an equatorial zone producing desert-like conditions. The late Triassic 245-208 Ma or early Jurassic 208-144 Ma to Jura-Cretaceous 208-66 Ma where red clay beds and marine clastics were deposited. Pangea began to separate during the Jurassic period. The Kimberlite Volcanoes of this period produce the Kimberlite diamonds which are mined today. Near Fort à La Corne (FALC) were Kimberlite volcanoes in Archean cratons. Cretaceous seaway The Cretaceous 144-66 Ma to Miocene periods deposited clastic sediments from the Cordilleran orogeny. This period saw 40% of the region now called North America below sea level under the Rocky Mountain Seaway which comprised the Western Interior Seaway and the Hudson Seaway, and Labrador Seaway. The Cretaceous period rocks produce medium and heavy gravity oil in the Lloydminster region, and of the western province. The Laramide orogeny episode near the end of the Cretaceous and early Tertiary period caused larger gravels to be deposited from the newly formed Rocky Mountains when the Kula and Farallon Plates subducted below the North American plate. In the Cypress Hills area and southern Saskatchewan, lignite deposits developed from the marshes of these Tertiary rivers. The sea waters have retreated from the areas known as Saskatchewan. The Ravenscrag formation, Cypress Hills, and Wood Mountain Formations were notable gravel deposits from the Tertiary period. The Williston Basin affects this region at the southern edge. Tectonic movements and global changes in the sea level have given rise to a source of oil, natural gas, and coal. Quaternary period During the Quaternary period, between 2 and 3 million years ago, the prairies were covered by a glacier, the Laurentide Ice Sheet. Northern hemisphere glaciation during the last ice ages. The accumulation of thick ice sheets caused a sea level lowering of about It was thick, which advanced and receded several times across the prairies. There were multiple glaciations affecting the Saskatchewan area during the Pre-Illinoian, Illinoian, and Wisconsin stages of the last Ice Age. These glaciations occurred during the Quaternary period, which comprises the last two million years. Northern Saskatchewan and the shield area shows the effects of glacial erosion and scour; the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin is a location of glacial deposition and collection. In southern Saskatchewan there are late Pliocene, pre-Illinoian continental glaciation sand and gravel deposits left behind from water deposition (alluvial) and glacial edge deposits (colluvial). By the study of till, terrain, the limits of the Illinoian glaciation are evidenced around Willow Bunch Lake, Wood Mountain, Cypress Hills area. Receding glacier The melting glaciers left behind sand and, silt outwash plains. The Great Sand Hills of Saskatchewan are evidence of winds and sand storms which have accumulated the sands left behind. Retreating glaciers left meltwater, which pooled in lakes. Lake AgassizAn early map of the extent of Lake Agassiz (by 19th century geologist Warren Upham). This map is now believed to underestimate the extent of the region once overlain by Lake Agassiz.Glacial Lake Regina covered south- central area, and Glacial Lake Agassiz covered much of Saskatchewan and neighbouring regions of the US and Manitoba. The ice and water retreated, and the lake beds formed flat plains. The land exposed from under the ice sheets was rubble, and ridges of gravel. =Glaciotectonic hills= The Dirt Hills and Cactus Hills represent the most defined and biggest Møns Klint glaciotectonic hills of the world. There are other similar hills created by ice action in southern Saskatchewan as well. Glaciotectonic hills or ice- shoved hills show thrusting, folds, ridges and push moraines. These hills consist of upper Cretaceous bedrock which rises to an elevation of in the Dirt Hills. To the north is the Regina Lake Plain, which is lower in elevation. The Missouri Coteau from whence the hills arise, is lower than these hills. Between the Alberta and Saskatchewan Plains is the Missouri Coteau, dead ice moraine, a major escarpment, a long meandering ridge of hill country. The area is probably underlain with marine shale of the Bearpaw Formation. This area remained above the ice sheets, being pushed and folded by the glacier movement. Astroblemes There are six notable meteorite or comet impact craters in Saskatchewan. Carswell, Deep Bay, and Gow Lake have affected the Canadian Shield area of the north. In the southern Phanerozoic crater are the Viewfield, Elbow, and Maple Creek structures. The Carswell structure is the largest astrobleme at in diameter. It is estimated that the impact to the Athabasca basin occurred about 478 million years ago during the Ordovician period. The thrust of the impact affected the Athabasca Rock groups. The William River Subgroup and the Douglas and Carswell formations show inversions, thrusting and disruptions. The impact that occurred about 210 million years ago has created the Gow Lake Structure. This lake is in diameter with Calder island centrally located. La Ronge is south-southwest of the crater location. The other impact crater of the Cambrian shield is the Deep Bay Structure, which created a bay in the southerly part of Reindeer Lake. The crater is about in diameter and about at the deepest point. The circular impact ridge above water level partially encompasses the crater area. There is some central uplift. The crater was formed about 50 to 150 million years ago. With photographs of Deep Bay, and Gow Lake craters Weyburn is west and Stoughton is north of the Viewfield Impact Structure, a small impact crater in diameter. The impact occurred in the early Jurassic period about 190 million years ago. Oil and gas reserves have been found in the area of the rim breccia Another impact crater in the Phanerezoic crater is the Maple Creek Structure. This impact affected Upper Cretaceous Bearpaw Formation sediments on the north edge of the Cypress Hills, and roughly occurred 75 million years ago. Maple Creek is located north northwest of this diameter crater. The Elbow Impact Structure is in diameter and the impact occurred between 370 and 415 million years ago during the Devonian Period. The crater is located in Maple Bush rural municipality north of Aitkow (Riverhurst) and west of Grainfield (Grainland). The Elbow crater is located south of the elbow of the South Saskatchewan, and south of Diefenbaker lake across the waters from the town of Elbow which is north of the South Saskatchewan River.

Eventually Berg and Rinde included Ante Rune Giskeødegård, Ronnie Michael André Giskegjerde Larsen and Kai Valderhaug in the line-up, and the band played together for about four years before the members were scattered due to education and illness.. The band reformed in Oslo in 1999, when all the members except bass player Valderhaug were living in Oslo. The band went by the name Jupiter Starfish before they changed the band name back to The Margarets after a few months. Lars Berg had joined the band as bass player and in March 2001 the band reached the Norwegian music charts with the song \\"Rubber Rubbish\\". Their debut album What Kept You? from 2002 immediately reached second place on the Norwegian music charts. The debut album sold more than 30 000 copies. The songs on The Margarets' debut album were written about ten years before the album was released, hence the title of the album. In 2005 their second album Love Will Haunt You Down was released, reached fifth place on Norwegian music charts and sold well. Several bands from Manchester such as The Smiths, Joy Division and The Stone Roses influenced The Margarets. In 2007 the band went on a tour in the UK and played at the In the City music festival in Manchester to great reviews. BBC nominated The Margarets as one of their top seven favourites BBC Manchester - In The City’s choice cuts and Manchester Evening News nominated them as one of the six best bands at In the City 2007.Manchester Evening News - ITC: Roll on 2008!

Early life He was born in Limerick, into one of the city's most politically influential families, elder son of the Rev. Stackpole Pery and Jane Twigge. Political career A trained barrister, Pery became a member of the Irish House of Commons for the Wicklow Borough constituency in 1751. On the dissolution of the house following the death of George II, Pery was elected for the constituency of Limerick City and served from 1761 until 1785, becoming Speaker of the House in 1771. In 1783, he stood also for Dungannon, however chose to sit for Limerick City. He was considered one of the most powerful politicians in Ireland in his time, leading a faction which included his nephew the future Earl of Limerick and his relatives by marriage, the Hartstonges. Following his resignation, he was created Viscount Pery, of Newtown Pery, near the City of Limerick, in the Peerage of Ireland, entitling him to a seat in the Irish House of Lords. As he had no male heirs, his title became extinct on his death.  Role in the development of Limerick  Pery is also noted for his part in the history of the architecture of Limerick. In 1765, he commissioned the engineer Davis Ducart to design a town plan for land that Pery owned on the southern edge of the existing city, which led to the construction of the Georgian area of the city later known as Newtown Pery. He was also commemorated in the naming of Pery Square.  Family  Pery married Patricia Martin of Dublin in 1756, who died a year later, and secondly Elizabeth Vesey, daughter of the 1st Baron Knapton. He and Elizabeth had two daughters: *Hon. Diana Pery, who married Thomas Knox, 1st Earl of Ranfurly. *Hon. Frances Pery, who married Nicolson Calvert, MP for Hertfordshire.

Shkurtov wrote in his memoirs: In early 1904, despite attempts by the Greek and Turkish authorities to be arrested, Shkurtov returned to the region of Kostur and included in the reconstruction of disorganized IMARO. He was secretary of voyvode Kostando Zhivkov and after his death in December 1904 was appointed a voivode of the region of Kostenariya.

Tesla claimed to have conceived of it after studying the Van de Graaff generator. Tesla described the weapon as being able to be used against ground-based infantry or for anti-aircraft purposes. Description Tesla described Teleforce's operation in 1934, specifying its superiority to the death rays believed to exist at the time: > My apparatus projects particles which may be relatively large or of > microscopic dimensions, enabling us to convey to a small area at a great > distance trillions of times more energy than is possible with rays of any > kind.

In a letter that was written to J. P. Morgan, Jr. on November 29, 1934, Tesla described the weapon: > I have made recent discoveries of inestimable value... The flying machine > has completely demoralized the world, so much that in some cities, as London > and Paris, people are in mortal fear from aerial bombing.

Retrieved 2013-12-03 In 1937, Tesla wrote a treatise, \\"The Art of Projecting Concentrated Non- dispersive Energy through the Natural Media\\",THE NEW ART OF PROJECTING CONCENTRATED NON-DISPERSIVE ENERGY THROUGH NATURAL MEDIA -- System of Particle Acceleration for Use in National Defense. concerning charged particle beam weapons. Tesla published the document in an attempt to expound on the technical description of a 'superweapon\\" that would put an end to all war.\\" This treatise is currently in the Nikola Tesla Museum archive in Belgrade. It describes an open-ended vacuum tube with a gas jet seal that allows particles to exit, a method of charging particles to millions of volts, and a method of creating and directing non-dispersive particle streams (through electrostatic repulsion).  \\"Death ray\\" misnomer  Teleforce was mentioned publicly in the New York Sun and The New York Times on July 11, 1934. The press called it a \\"peace ray\\" or death ray. The idea of a \\"death ray\\" was a misunderstanding in regard to Tesla's term when he referred to his invention as a \\"death beam\\" so Tesla went on to explain that \\"this invention of mine does not contemplate the use of any so-called 'death rays.' Rays are not applicable because they cannot be produced in requisite quantities and diminish rapidly in intensity with distance. All the energy of New York City (approximately two million horsepower) transformed into rays and projected twenty miles, could not kill a human being, because, according to a well known law of physics, it would disperse to such an extent as to be ineffectual. My apparatus projects particles ...\\" > What set Tesla's proposal apart from the usual run of fantasy \\"death rays\\" > was a unique vacuum chamber with one end open to the atmosphere. Tesla > devised a unique vacuum seal by directing a high-velocity air stream at the > tip of his gun to maintain \\"high vacua.\\" The necessary pumping action would > be accomplished with a large Tesla turbine. Components of Teleforce In total, the components and methods included: * An apparatus for producing manifestations of energy in free air instead of in a high vacuum as in the past. * A mechanism for generating tremendous electrical force. * A means of intensifying and amplifying the force developed by the second mechanism. * A new method for producing a tremendous electrical repelling force. This would be the projector, or gun, of the invention. It has been said that the charged particles would self-focus via \\"gas focusing,\\". In 1940, Tesla estimated that each station would cost no more than $2,000,000 and could have been constructed in a few months. After Tesla died, in a box purported to contain a part of Tesla's \\"death ray\\" apparatus, John G. Trump found a 45-year-old multidecade resistance box.  Attempts at development and marketing  By November 1934, Tesla was attempting (unsuccessfully) to obtain funding from J. P. Morgan's son, Jack Morgan. The idea of Tesla possibly having a new type of weapon and, further, his offer to give it to the League of Nations as a way to prevent future war were seen together as an alarming security threat by one US diplomat – a view not shared by his government. In 1935, the Soviet Union, through the US Amtorg Trading Corporation, an alleged Soviet-arms front in New York City, paid Tesla $25,000 for detailed plans, specifications, and complete information on the method and apparatus, but it is unclear whether a physical device was ever produced. Tesla also attempted to get funding for his device in 1937, sending a paper (\\"New Art of Projecting Concentrated Non-Dispersive Energy Through Natural Media\\") outlining his plans to the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Canada, and Yugoslavia. The United Kingdom considered Tesla's offer to sell the device to them for $30 million, maybe with the idea that even hinting they had a super weapon would be a deterrent to Adolf Hitler, but by 1938 they had dropped all interest. During this period, Tesla claimed that efforts had been made to steal the invention, saying that his room had been entered and that his papers had been scrutinized, but that the thieves or spies had left empty- handed. He said that there was no danger that his invention could be stolen, for he had at no time committed any part of it to paper; the blueprint for the Teleforce weapon was all in his mind. At his birthday press conference in 1937, Tesla was asked about his weapon, and he made the claim, \\"But it is not an experiment... I have built, demonstrated and used it. Only a little time will pass before I can give it to the world.\\" At the 1940 birthday press conference, 84-year-old Tesla offered to develop his weapon for the US, but there was no interest in his offer.

After submitting the story Simons was assigned a fill-in Falcon story, which he inked with the assistance of Gil over Sal Buscemas pencils. This marked his first professional work for Marvel and in mainstream comic books. Simons was then assigned both pencilling and inking jobs for Marvel.Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics Creators One of the artists whose pencils he inked was Gene Colan. \\"Gene Colan was always my favorite penciler to work on ... [T]hat was like a match made in heaven because a lot of people didn't understand Gene's shading. I thought, 'this is great, this is a great jumping on point if you're gonna do black and white stuff'\\".Adelaide Comics And Books Colan has spoken highly of Simons's talent. \\"Do you know how few artists have ever been able to ink my very complex and often inscrutable pencils? Do you know how exquisitely Dave Simon inks my pencils? ... I've yet to see anything Dave has done that I haven't loved! Artists and inkers have come and gone but Dave remains today still at the top of his form!\\"Dave Simons Appreciation Society At Facebook Simons' attention to detail came into high demand in the 1980s and his inking credits include artists such as Keith Pollard, Ron Wilson, Frank Miller, John Buscema, Marc Silvestri, Greg LaRocque, John Romita Jr and Ed Hannigan. Titles that featured his inking include Thor, The Thing, Marvel Premiere, Night Thrasher, Iron Man, King Conan, Doctor Strange, Star Wars, Star Trek, Thundercats and others. Simons's tenure at Marvel was not limited to inking.Vine Comic Vine He proved himself to be a very capable penciler and his pencils and ink combination were featured in titles such as The Spectacular Spider-Man, Team America, What If, Marvel Comics Presents, Bizarre Adventures, Red Sonja, Web of Spider-Man, and King Conan. He also provided cover art to titles such as Power Man and Iron Fist, Ghost Rider, Darkhold, Machine Man, Kull The Conqueror, Marvel Team-Up, Marvel Two-in-One, Crystar, Moon Knight and many others, along with pin-ups for the black and white magazine Savage Sword of Conan \\"Pencilling, if you're doing it right ... is a much tougher gig than inking. Even though I usually liked to know what was going on, with inking you don't necessarily have to be involved with the story. With pencilling you have to be intimately involved with the story because you're the one who's bringing the writers work and intentions across to the readers, as to what he's trying to communicate there. You have to think of the drama, the camera angles, and the composition, make sure you leave room for the word balloons, all those sorts of things\\". Ghost Rider Simons' best known Marvel work was his run on the first series of Ghost Rider. His run on the title saw him first inking veteran artist Don Perlin before joining with Bob Budiansky to create one of the best remembered runs of the characters history. Budiansky and Simons worked with writers Roger Stern and J.M. DeMatteis. \\"The only speed bump we hit in this whole thing was when Simons, who of that team is the unsung hero, left\\", Budiansky recalled. \\"He used to come to the office dressed in leather. I mean, this was not an act, he'd come dressed in one of these black leather, zipper jackets. I don't know if he also wore leather pants. He might have worn them. But anyway, the point is, he knew how to ink leather, which was really important for Ghost Rider. So when he left the book we never really were able to replace that look that he gave the book. The rest of the team was all somewhat saddened by his departure.\\"Bob Budiansky Marvel attempted to duplicate the highly detailed and rendered look that Budiansky and Simons were able to give the character when the character was relaunched in the early 1990s but never quite succeeded. =DC Comics= In the 1990s Simons left Marvel and crossed companies to DC Comics.\\"Mike's Amazing World of DC\\" At DC he worked on Deathstroke The Terminator, Spelljammer, Dragonlance, and Forgotten Realms. \\"I liked the combination of me and Rags Morales ...

As an artist he provided storyboards to such shows as Captain Planet, Exo-Squad, Masters Of The Universe, Zula Patrol, Psi-Kix and Maya and Miguel. \\"The list of shows I've worked on is certainly longer than the list of comic books that I've worked on at this point\\", Simons once commented Simons also storyboarded for the show Spy Dogs, which was directed by Will Meugniot and later, Mike Joens. Dave worked again with Gil on this show, hiring him as a storyboard artist. Simons has the distinction of working on both an animated TV program and the comic book spin-off at the same time, this was when he worked on the animated show Courage The Cowardly Dog, which he subsequently drew the DC comic book of the same name. =Post-animation= Simons also created characters.

Around that time, notable inventors such as Guglielmo Marconi,Rachele Mussolini, Mussolini privato, Milano, 1979, Rusconi Editore. Nikola Tesla, Harry Grindell Matthews, Edwin R. Scott, Erich Graichen and others claimed to have invented it independently. In 1957, the National Inventors Council was still issuing lists of needed military inventions that included a death ray. While based in fiction, research into energy-based weapons inspired by past speculation has contributed to real-life weapons in use by modern militaries sometimes called a sort of \\"death ray\\", such as the United States Navy and its Laser Weapon System (LaWS) deployed in mid-2014. Such armaments are technically known as directed-energy weapons. History In the year 1923, Edwin R. Scott, an inventor from San Francisco, claimed he was the first to develop a death ray that would destroy human life and bring down planes at a distance. He was born in Detroit, and he claimed he worked for nine years as a student and protégé of Charles P. Steinmetz. Harry Grindell-Matthews tried to sell what he reported to be a death ray to the British Air Ministry in 1924. He was never able to show a functioning model or demonstrate it to the military. Nikola Tesla claimed to have invented a \\"death beam\\" which he called teleforce in the 1930s and continued the claims up until his death. Tesla explained that \\"this invention of mine does not contemplate the use of any so-called 'death rays'. Rays are not applicable because they cannot be produced in requisite quantities and diminish rapidly in intensity with distance. All the energy of New York City (approximately two million horsepower) transformed into rays and projected twenty miles, could not kill a human being, because, according to a well known law of physics, it would disperse to such an extent as to be ineffectual. My apparatus projects particles which may be relatively large or of microscopic dimensions, enabling us to convey to a small area at a great distance trillions of times more energy than is possible with rays of any kind. Many thousands of horsepower can thus be transmitted by a stream thinner than a hair, so that nothing can resist.\\" Tesla proposed that a nation could \\"destroy anything approaching within 200 miles ... [and] will provide a wall of power\\" in order to \\"make any country, large or small, impregnable against armies, airplanes, and other means for attack\\". He claimed to have worked on the project since about 1900, and said that it drew power from the ionosphere, which he called \\"an invisible ball of energy surrounding Earth\\". He said that he had done this with the help of a 50-foot tesla coil. Antonio Longoria in 1934 claimed to have a death ray that could kill pigeons from four miles away and could kill a mouse enclosed in a \\"thick walled metal chamber\\". During World War II, the Germans had at least two projects, and the Japanese one, to create so called death rays. One German project led by Ernst Schiebold concerned a particle accelerator with a steerable bundle of beryllium rods running through the vertical axis. The other was developed by Dr Rolf Widerøe and is referred to in his biography. The machine developed by Widerøe was in the Dresden Plasma Physics laboratory in February 1945 when the city was bombed. Widerøe led a team in March 1945 to remove the device from the ruined laboratory and deliver it to General Patton's 3rd Army at Burggrub where it was taken into US custody on 14 April 1945. The Japanese weapon was called Death ray \\"Ku-Go\\" which aimed to employ microwaves created in a large magnetron. In science fiction The concept of a death ray has fueled science fiction stories at least as early as Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy’s 1927 novel The Garin Death Ray. Later science fiction introduced the concept of the handheld raygun used by fictional characters such as Flash Gordon. In Alfred Noyes' 1940 novel The Last Man (US title: No Other Man), a death ray developed by a German scientist named Mardok is unleashed in a global war and almost wipes out the human race. Similar weapons are found in George Lucas' science fiction saga Star Wars.Holland, Charles. \\"Alfred Noyes, The Last Man\\" , St. Dunstan's Red and White, St. Dunstan's University.

Most active in the Seven Years' War and the War of American Independence, Ternay was the naval commander of a 1762 expedition that successfully captured St. John's Newfoundland. He was appointed commander of the Marine Royale, French naval forces, as part of the project code named Expédition Particulière that brought French troops to American soil in 1780.Kennett, Lee (1977). The French Forces in America, 1780-1783. Greenwood Press, Inc. Page 10 He died aboard ship off Newport, Rhode Island. Early life Ternay was born on 27 January 1723, probably in Angers, to Charles-François d'Arsac, Marquis de Ternay and Louise Lefebvre de Laubrière. He served as a page in the Knights of Malta beginning in 1737, and joined the French Navy the following year. He rose through the ranks, and received his first command, the Robuste, on 10 January 1761. Seven Years' War In 1762, late in the Seven Years' War, Ternay was chosen to lead a secret expedition against the British-controlled island of Newfoundland. With instructions to take and hold the island, and possibly also make an attack on Fortress Louisbourg, then in British hands, Ternay led a squadron of two ships of the line, one frigate, and two flutes through the British blockade of the French coast from Brest on 20 May 1762. Arriving at Bay Bulls on 20 June, he landed 750 soldiers, led by Joseph-Louis-Bernard de Cléron d'Haussonville, who captured St. John's without resistance from its small British garrison. Ternay then oversaw the destruction of St. John's fishing stages and fishing fleet. British estimates of the damage ran to £1 million. Although the French had not anticipated a British response until the next year, General Sir Jeffery Amherst was alerted to the French raid in July, and organized an expedition to recover Newfoundland. The British fleet arrived on 12 September, landing 1,500 troops the next day at Torbay. Two days later the French troops had retreated into Fort William after the Battle of Signal Hill. In a council, Ternay advocated abandoning the position, but was apparently outvoted, with the council opting to leave the ground forces and some marines, but also making provision for their eventual recovery by the fleet after it left the harbour. However, given a favourable wind and foggy conditions, Ternay decided to depart that night, and slipped away, leaving the ground forces to surrender three days later. Ternay's return to France was difficult: he was forced to run from British ships to the Spanish port of Corunna, and only reached Brest in January 1763. Although criticised by d'Haussonville for abandoning him, Ternay's actions met with approval, since he had managed to save his fleet. War of American Independence Ternay's grave at the Trinity Churchyard in Newport After the war he continued in several ship commands, and was finally promoted to brigadier general in 1771, when he was also named governor-general of Isle de France (now Mauritius) and Île-Bourbon (present-day Réunion). He was promoted to rear admiral in November 1776. In 1780 he was given command of the naval forces of the Expédition Particulière, which carried the French army of the Comte de Rochambeau to Newport, Rhode Island. On 2 May 1780, he departed Brest with a 7-ship and 3-frigate squadron, escorting 36 transports carrying troops to support the Continental Army in the War of American Independence. The squadron comprised the 80-gun Duc de Bourgogne, under Ternay d'Arsac (admiral) and Médine (flag captain); the 74-gun Neptune, under Sochet Des Touches, and Conquérant, under La Grandière; and the 64-gun Provence under Lombard, Ardent under Bernard de Marigny, Jason under La Clocheterie and Éveillé under Le Gardeur de Tilly, and the frigates Surveillante under Villeneuve Cillart, Amazone under La Pérouse, and Bellone. Amazone, which constituted the vanguard of the fleet, arrived at Boston on 11 June 1780. Ternay's fleet was blockaded by the British after his arrival. He died of typhus aboard his flagship, Duc de Bourgogne, on 15 December 1780. Sochet Des Touches assumed command of the expedition. Ternay's entry into the Knights of Malta included a vow of celibacy, so he consequently never married or had children. He was buried in the cemetery of the Trinity Church in Newport, where memorials given by King Louis XV and the United States Congress have been placed in his honour. He was posthumously enrolled in the Society of the Cincinnati for his role in the war. In the Port Glaud district of Mahé, Seychelles, Baie Ternay (a bay) and Cap Ternay (a cape) are named after him.

The 26th Brigade took part in the Landing at Lae in September 1943 and the Huon Peninsula campaign from October 1943 to January 1944. Following these campaigns the brigade returned to Australia, and did not see action again until 1945. In May 1945 Whitehead commanded the Australian landing at Tarakan. During this operation the 26th Brigade was expanded to almost the size of a division, and United States Army and Netherlands East Indies units served under Whitehead's command. Whitehead relinquished command of the 26th Brigade on 10 December 1945 and returned to Australia two days later. Later life Following the war, Whitehead returned to citizen soldiering and was commander of the CMF 2nd Armoured Brigade from November 1947. He also served as the aide de camp to the Governor General of Australia between January 1949 and May 1952 and commanded the CMF contingent which attended the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II between March and June 1953. Whitehead retired from the army in 1954. After leaving the military Whitehead worked as a manager at Shell between 1945 and 1956. From 1956 until his retirement in 1961 he was an arbitrator with the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. David Whitehead died in 1992.

Orwell discusses nationalism and argues that it causes people to disregard common sense and to become more ignorant towards facts. Orwell shows his concern for the social state of Europe and the rest of the world because of the increasing influence of nationalistic sentiment in a large number of countries. The essay was soon translated into French and Dutch, Italian and Finnish (in which the word nationalism was represented by chauvinisme). The article was abridged in the translated versions by omitting details of particular relevance to British readers. A short introduction, based on material supplied by Orwell, preceded the translated abridgements.I Belong to the Left, p. 155. The first German translation was published on January 29th, 2020. \\"Menschen wie Insekten\\", die Tageszeitung, 25.01.2010, p. 15. Content The essay was written during the final stages of World War II while Europe had just witnessed the destructive effects of political movements. Nazism is used as an example of how nationalism can cause havoc between groups of people and can instigate ignorance within those groups. Orwell compares Nazism with other forms of nationalistic ideologies to generate an overall argument and questions the function of nationalism. Nationalism is the name that Orwell gives to the propensity of \\"identifying oneself with a single nation or other unit, placing it beyond good and evil and recognising no other duty than that of advancing its interests\\". Its occurrence is visible throughout history, and it is prevalent. Nationalism is defined as alignment to a political entity but can also encompass a religion, race, ideology or any other abstract idea. Examples of such forms of nationalism given by Orwell include Communism, political Catholicism, Zionism, anti-Semitism, Trotskyism and pacifism.Orwell, George, \\"Notes on Nationalism\\", 1945, para 3 Orwell additionally argues that his definition of \\"nationalism\\" is not equal to the notion, held by himself and most other people, of \\"patriotism\\": \\"Patriotism is of its nature defensive.... Nationalism, on the other hand, is inseparable from the desire for power.\\"Orwell, George, \\"Notes on Nationalism\\", 1945, para 2 Orwell explains that he uses the expression \\"nationalism\\" for lack of a better alternative to label the concept that he describes in his essay. Orwell argues that nationalism largely influences the thoughts and actions of people, even in such everyday tasks as decision-making and reasoning. The example provided is of asking the question: \\"Out of the three major Allies, which contributed most to the fall of Nazism?\\". People aligned with the United States, Britain and the Soviet Union would consider their country first before they attempt to search for supportive arguments.Orwell, George, \\"Notes on Nationalism\\", 1945, para 5. One of the themes that Orwell discusses is the effect of nationalistic sentiment on human thinking. Nationalism causes dishonesty within people because, he argues, every nationalist, having chosen one side, persuades himself that his side is the strongest, regardless of the arguments against the faction. From that sense of superiority, people then argue for and defend their faction. The slightest slur or criticism from another faction causes them to retort or be violent since they realise they are serving a larger entity, which provides them with that sense of security and so they must defend it. Additionally, they may also become ignorant to the point of self- deception. Orwell argues: \\"The nationalist not only does not disapprove of atrocities committed by his own side, but he has a remarkable capacity for not even hearing about them. For quite six years the English admirers of Hitler contrived not to learn of the existence of Dachau and Buchenwald. And those who are loudest in denouncing the German concentration camps are often quite unaware, or only very dimly aware, that there are also concentration camps in Russia. Huge events like the Ukraine famine of 1933, involving the deaths of millions of people, have actually escaped the attention of the majority of English russophiles\\".Orwell, George, \\"Notes on Nationalism\\", 1945, para 13. Such people become susceptible to bias by acknowledging only information that they judge as true, as emotions hinder them in properly addressing facts. People believe in what they approve in their own minds as true to the point that they deem it as an absolute truth: \\"More probably they feel that their own version was what happened in the sight of God, and that one is justified in rearranging the records accordingly\\".Orwell, George, \\"Notes on Nationalism\\", 1945, para 14. Orwell also criticises the silliness and the dishonesty of intellectuals who become more nationalistic on behalf of another country for which they have no real knowledge, rather than their native country. Orwell argues that much of the romanticism, written about leaders such as Stalin, for example, and describe their might, power and integrity, was written by intellectuals. An intellectual is influenced by a certain public opinion, \\"that is, the section of public opinion of which he as an intellectual is aware\\". He is surrounded by scepticism and disaffection, which is not very compatible with a very deep attachment to his own country: \\"He still feels the need for a Fatherland, and it is natural to look for one somewhere abroad. Having found it, he can wallow unrestrainedly in exactly those emotions from which he believes that he has emancipated himself\\".Orwell, George, \\"Notes on Nationalism\\", 1945, para 11. Also, Orwell provides three characteristics to describe those who follow nationalistic sentiment: obsession, instability and indifference to reality. Obsession refers to how nationalists passionately tender to their faction: \\"As nearly as possible, no nationalist ever thinks, talks, or writes about anything except the superiority of his own power unit. It is difficult if not impossible for any nationalist to conceal his allegiance.... he will generally claim superiority for it (if the chosen unit of allegiance is a country) not only in military power and political virtue, but in art, literature, sport, structure of the language, the physical beauty of the inhabitants, and perhaps even in climate, scenery and cooking. He will show great sensitiveness about such things as the correct display of flags, relative size of headlines and the order in which different countries are named\\".Orwell, George, \\"Notes on Nationalism\\", 1945, para 9. \\"Some nationalists are not far from schizophrenia, living quite happily amid dreams of power and conquest which have no connexion with the physical world\\".Orwell, George, \\"Notes on Nationalism\\", 1945, para 15 Orwell argues that uncertainty over the disasters reported (\\"What were the rights and wrongs of the Warsaw rising of 1944? Is it true about the German gas ovens in Poland?\\") makes it \\"easier to cling to lunatic beliefs.... Since nothing is ever quite proved or disproved, the most unmistakeable fact can be impudently denied.... The nationalist is often somewhat uninterested in what happens in the real world\\". Regarding instability, Orwell reasons that nationalism can become ironical in various ways. Many of the leaders revered by nationalist factions are outright foreigners, who do not even belong to the country that they have glorified. More often, they are \\"from peripheral areas where nationality is doubtful\\". For instance, Stalin was a Georgian, and Hitler was an Austrian, but both were respectively idolised in Russia and Germany. Indifference to reality refers to \\"the power of not seeing resemblances between similar sets of facts\\" and is a feature of all nationalists, according to Orwell. He describes how nationalism clouds people from perceiving facts of the real world. The use of torture, hostages, forced labour, mass deportations, imprisonment without trial, forgery, assassination, the bombing of civilians all prove to be irrelevant towards the notion of \\"good or bad\\", and there is no outrage from within the public, as the atrocities are committed by \\"our side\\". Some nationalists even go into the trouble of defending such actions and search for arguments to support their case. Orwell provides the example of the liberal News Chronicle publishing images of Russians hanged by the Germans to depict the shocking barbarity of the Germans and then, a few years later, publishing with warm approval very-similar photographs of Germans hanged by the Russians. Another similar instance is another newspaper publishing, with seeming approval, photographs of the baiting by a mob in Paris of scantily-clad women, who collaborated with the Nazis. The photographs strongly resembled the Nazi images of Jews being baited by the Berlin mob in the years before the war.

It contains about of mapped passageways. Temperatures inside average year- round.Colossal Cave Mountain Park Previous names include 'Mountain Springs Cave' and 'Five–Mile Cave'. The cave is an ancient karst cave, classified as \\"dry\\" by guides (though this is not a speleologic term). The meaning of this is that its formations are completely dry, or \\"dead\\", and do not grow. This is because the cave was formed by water depositing limestone, but this source has disappeared. It instead feeds the \\"active\\" nearby Arkenstone Cave that continues to grow formations. Colossal Cave was used from 900 to 1450 AD by the Hohokam, Sobaipuri, and Apache Indians. Early History of Colossal Cave and the Mountain Springs Ranch According to David Leighton, historian for the Arizona Daily Star newspaper, in 1876, a man named Sidney H. Ramsey, a native of Louisiana, was owner of the Mountain Springs Station, a stage stop approximately 22 miles east of Tucson, in the foothills of the Rincon Mountains. This station was likely of recent construction because it was along a new road from Tucson to Tres Alamos, a farming community in the San Pedro Valley. The station was \\"abundantly supplied with water by a living spring and stream of delicious water and excellent grass and plenty of wood for campers are all about.\\" It also provided \\"first-rate meals prepared to order...and (was) always supplied with hay and grain.\\" Within a couple years, E.H. “Hank” Bridwell had taken over the Mountain Springs Ranch, which now included the Mountain Springs Hotel and Mountain Springs Station. Around 1879, Solomon Lick a former Union soldier and a partner took over the ranch. They advertised it as “The finest summer resort for families and winter resort for hunters and sportsmen in southern Arizona…Mineral springs are nearby and special accommodations are provided for families, there being six excellent rooms, well furnished.” The ranch's dairy provided fresh milk, butter and eggs for the guests. In January 1879, Lick along with a few companions came across what was believed to be either an old mine or cave with Lick and party exploring this large cavity for about 500 feet from the entrance. Soon after, an exploration team, guided by candles placed in a small board, visited the cave, with the local newspaper reporting what they had discovered: “An arched entrance three feet wide and four feet high…At the mouth of the cave the air was terribly foul…discovered to be from the large deposits of bat excrement all through the cave…The finding of ashes and other indications of fire, evidently very old..(and) no doubt one of the haunts and resting places of the Apaches…Bones of all kinds lay scattered around, no less than 500 deer antlers being seen and other evidences of life destruction and feasting…They brought out with them many beautiful specimens of stalactites and some fine deer antlers which they brought with them to the city.” In 1884, the local paper reported that “The Mountain Springs Cave” was still for the most part unexplored and that the greatest distance that had been explored up to this point was a half a mile. A few years later, this underground chamber is believed to have been used as a hideout by train robbers who held up the Southern Pacific Express, Train Number 20 on two different occasions. On the first heist the men made off with $3,000 in currency and the second time with gold and silver Mexican dollars. By 1890, William Shaw had taken over the Mountain Springs Ranch and that year, along with soldiers from Fort Lowell explored the cavern for five hours utilizing candles and magnesium wire to illuminate their path through the underground chambers. They were awed by the finger-shaped and kidney-shaped stalactites and stalagmites that occurred in large quantities and the holes that were so deep they could barely hear the rock dropped down when it hit the bottom. The first decade of the new century saw the formation of an enterprise to excavate the bat guano in the cave which led to the boring of an approximately 75-foot tunnel to access this commodity. It's believed seven carloads were taken and shipped to Los Angeles before it was exhausted. In the 1910s, a group proposed significant development of the cavern for tourism and also the construction of a railroad spur from nearby Vail but nothing resulted from this effort. In December 1917, after Jim Westfall and Alfred A. Trippel laid claim to the cave and the land surrounding it, for the possible creation of a tourist attraction, Trippel asked Lynn Hodgson an amateur spelunker, to explore the cave. After the survey, Hodgson told Trippel that “the cave was colossal,” and Hodgson later claimed this is where the name “Colossal Cave” comes from. Another possible source, according to Mr. Leighton, was from Byron Cummings of the University of Arizona, who had explored the cave around the same time and may have given it its name.David Leighton, \\"Street Smarts: How an impressive cave came to be found in a mountain springs area\\" Arizona Daily Star, Nov. 3, 2019 Colossal Cave Mountain Park Entry to Colossal Cave Park Today the cave is a popular tourist destination as part of Colossal Cave Mountain Park.Colossal Cave (showcaves.com) The park also features two other caves, named Arkenstone and La Tetera, which are protected and are being studied by researchers.

These two symbols are distinct from each other in style. Similar to other states of Malaysia with Malay royalties, both the flag and arms of Selangor are influenced by royalties, Islam, and political symbols of the state. Flag 20px Flag of Selangor. Ratio: 1:2 The flag of Selangor consists of four proportionally-sized sections. The upper left and lower right sections are red, while the upper right and lower left sections are yellow. The red sections symbolise bravery. The yellow sections refer to royalty, represented by the local monarchy of Selangor, and the Sultan, who is the head of the state. The official religion of Selangor is Islam, and that is denoted by the white crescent and star on the top left corner of the flag. This flag has an official ratio of 1:2, although the flag is also manufactured in 2:3 proportions with 4x6 and 6x9 foot flags being common. The flag's design has been in use by the state government with few changes decades before Malaya's independence, the only noticeable differences of earlier iterations being the use of yellow instead of white for the crescent and star. The present flag design was adopted on 30 January 1965. Emblem The emblem of Selangor is a symbol of the state; it cannot properly be called a coat of arms as it does not respect heraldic traditions. It is an amalgam of items that represent courage and royalty. The crescent moon and star in the centre represent Islam. The red spear (tombak) in the centre is called the Sambu Warna. The emblem is supported by a short kris (keris pendek) on the right and a long kris (keris panjang) on the left. These weapons constitute the royal regalia of the state. The motto of the state is written in the Jawi script in red, and it reads Dipelihara Allah or \\"Under the Protection of Allah\\". A broad belt (tali bengkung) appears underneath the motto. It was worn by local warriors of the past to secure their waistcloth. District, city and municipal flags While Selangor has not followed the practice of Kelantan, Terengganu and Johor in assigning flags for its districts, cities and municipal areas, some local government authorities in the state have adopted their own flags however.

They cover a combined of the Allegheny Plateau and contain some of old-growth forest representative of the area. They are located in Wetmore Township, McKean County, Pennsylvania, near Kane. History The areas are a remnant of the original forest that once covered on the Allegheny Plateau of New York and Pennsylvania. The old growth forest consists of 300- to 400-year-old American beech, Eastern hemlock and some sugar maple. Other tree species are yellow birch, sweet birch, black cherry, red maple, American basswood, tulip poplar, and cucumber magnolia. It is the type of forest that greeted early settlers and later supported a vast lumber industry. The tract of old growth was purchased by the federal government in 1936. The Scenic Area was dedicated for aesthetic purposes and the remaining area was set aside as a Research Natural Area for scientific studies. In 1973, both areas were added to the National Registry of National Natural Landmarks Program in recognition of their unique status. During early evening hours of May 31, 1985, a devastating tornado moved through the northern half of Tionesta Scenic Area. Its destructive wake can still be seen, a reminder of natural powers well beyond human control. Natural features This secluded area is nearly roadless and offers great opportunities for solitude and nature study. You may encounter white-tailed deer, American black bear, fishers, and several bat species. Bird watchers can search for numerous species that prefer old growth forests, like barred owls, northern goshawks, pileated woodpeckers, flycatchers, thrushes, and warblers. The area is a typical plateau cut by streams, with flat uplands and steep- sided valleys. Elevations range from in stream bottom areas, to on plateau tops. Large rock outcrops can be found throughout this area. Trails A portion of the North Country National Scenic Trail passes through the Tionesta Scenic Area. The Twin Lakes Trail, marked with gray diamonds, traverses the southern part of the Scenic Area. This trail connects the North Country Trail with Twin Lakes Recreation Area and is long.

The lake is situated about southwest of Meekatharra. Description The lake is roughly in area, and consists of a main waterbody with two elongate arms. The main waterbody is roughly rectangular, with its long side oriented along a north-westerly axis. A narrow arm, essentially a network of anastomosing creeks, arises from near the eastern edge, stretching north almost to Meekatharra; the lake receives inflow from this arm and also some smaller creeks on the west and north side. Drainage is via the other arm, which arises from near the western edge and reaches almost to headwaters of the Hope River, into which Lake Anneen flows following heavy rains. A low ridge nearly divides the lake roughly in two, and the Great Northern Highway now runs along this ridge. Lake Annean is shallow, with a great many islands and peninsulas. Some parts of the lake almost always hold water, but the entire lake fills only after flooding caused by tropical summer and autumn rains. This occurs only every five to ten years. It is one of the most important breeding sites in Western Australia for Gelochelidon nilotica (gull- billed tern) and Chlidonias hybridus (whiskered tern). It is also an important refuge for other waterbirds, the nearest adjacent wetland, Wooleen Lake, being nearly away. The ghost town of Nannine is located on the northern banks of Lake Annean. The lake is no longer currently subject to any human use, except for some recreational sailboarding by residents of the area. Potential degrading processes include pastoral grazing, grazing and predation by feral and introduced animals, the illicit picking of wildflowers, and pollution by the highway or nearby gold mines.

It uses the dating system of the Spanish Era and is essentially an interpretation of the prophecy concerning the fate of Gog found in the biblical Book of Ezekiel.Vicente Catarino (1980), \\"The Spanish Reconquest: A Cluniac Holy War Against Islam?\\" Islam and the Medieval West: Aspects of Intercultural Relations, Khalil I. Semaan, ed. (SUNY Press, ), 87, who argues that the biblical prophetic framework in which the anonymous author sees history leaves religion and God as explanations but not reasons for the war against the Saracens. To the anonymous Asturian, the destruction of the Emirate of Córdoba is closely linked with the end times. According to Kenneth Baxter Wolf in the introduction to his translation, \\"The fact that Asturian armies at the time were taking advantage\\" of the weakness of the Umayyad emirate of Córdoba and \\"raiding deep into Muslim territory accounts for the overly optimistic estimates of the imminent Christian domination of the peninsula\\" in the Chronica Prophetica. The Chronica is divided into six sections: *Dicta Execielis profete, quod invenimus in libro pariticino (Sayings of Ezekiel the prophet, which we find in the Libro pariticino) It is here that the author gives his interpretation of Ezekiel and also dates himself to \\"era 921, the seventeenth year of Alfonso's rule in Oviedo\\". Gog is identified with the Goths, who will be defeated by \\"Ishmael\\", identified with the Muslims, in his own land before defeating them in Libya after 170 years of oppression (which the author believes elapses on 11 November 883). The libro pariticino is probably to be identified with the Chronicon Ovetense. *Genealogia Sarracenorum (Genealogy of the Saracens) This is a genealogy of the contemporary emir of Córdoba, Muhammad I, from Abraham and Hagar. The author mistakenly believes the Arabs claim descent from Sarah. *Storia de Mameth (History of Muhammad) This is one of the earliest Latin lives of Muhammad. Three other versions that were then circulating have survived, and one other is known to have been kept in the library of the monastery at Leyre in Navarre in 850. The clear intention of the author of this tract, written for a Christian audience, was to denigrate Islam's founder as a false prophet and a wicked man. Probably it was included in the Chronica to add justification to the war against Córdoba. *Ratio Sarracenorum de sua ingressione in Spania (Reason for the incursion of the Saracens into Spain) The author dates Roderic's defeat at the Battle of Guadalete to \\"the Ides of November in the year 752 era\\", that is, 11 November 714. He also identified two invasions, the first by Abu Zubra and the second, a year later, by Tarik; probably he has divided the historical figure Ṭāriq ibn Ziyad into two persons. He blames the Goths' defeat on their lack of penance for their sins: \\"The city of Toledo, victor of all peoples, succumbed as a victim to the triumphant Ishmaelites, and deserved to be subjected to them. Thus Spain was ruined for its disgusting sins, in the 380th year of the Goths.\\" *De Goti, qui remanserint civitates Ispaniensis (Of the Goths, who remained in the cities of the Spaniards) Here the author explains how the Goths, after Roderic's defeat, remained at war with the Saracens for seven years before concluding a pact with them whereby their fortifications were dismantled and they became \\"servants of arms\\" (servi armis). He then lists the rulers of Muslim Spain. Finally, he predicts its demise. He also mentions briefly two Viking raids: the \\"Lothomani\\" (Northmen) attacked the Kalends of August era 880 (AD 842) and again in July 858 (era 896), when \\"there was killing in Lisbon\\". *Reges que regnaberunt in Spania ex origine Ismaelitarum Beniumele (Kings who reigned in Spain from the beginning of the Umayyad Ishmaelites) This is a regnal list of the kings of Asturias beginning with Pelagius.

It is based on a true story, A Genius in the Family, the memoir of Hiram Percy Maxim, which focuses on the relationship between Maxim and his father, Sir Hiram Stevens Maxim. The film was Myrna Loy's first starring role as a freelance artist following her departure from M-G-M. Plot Farmer's daughter Jane Budden (Myrna Loy) sells her entire pig herd and moves to Brooklyn to find a husband. On the way to the home of her cousin, Garnet Allison (Molly Lamont), Jane runs into Hiram Maxim (Don Ameche), an eccentric inventor who is her cousin's neighbor. Jane scandalizes local society by saying she will not marry for love; she merely wants a rich husband who can give her the life of ease and culture she has long dreamed of. Amused by Jane's announcement, Hiram visits Jane and tells her she can forget about marrying him. Jane is attracted to Hiram, but angered at his effrontery. She is amused when one of Hiram's inventions turns out badly and Hiram is publicly humiliated. Jane goes to a dance, where Hiram makes negative comments on each of her suitors, especially rich real estate developer and attorney Josephus Ford (Richard Gaines). Jane agrees to marry Josephus. Hiram gate crashes Jane's engagement party, where Jane is dismayed to learn that Josephus wants her to sign a prenuptial agreement and believes Jane should be frugal, silent, and matronly. When Jane learns that Josephus has just invested in a pork-packing plant, she breaks her engagement, rushes to Hiram's home, and proposes to him herself. Hiram and Jane marry. Even though Hiram's inventions are only marginally profitable, the couple is happy. Jane gives birth to a son, Percy (Bobby Driscoll), whom Hiram raises in an unusual, freestyle manner to encourage his creativity and confidence. With Jane's constant encouragement, Hiram finally begins inventing things which meet practical needs and bring in a sizable income. A local organization decides to honor Hiram for his inventions by asking him to sit for a portrait. Hiram refuses. Jane, pregnant with a second child, hires the eccentric artist Magel (Rhys Williams) to paint the portrait anyway. Shortly thereafter, Percy tries to be amusing by adorning his dog Skipper with a baby bonnet, which Jane had received as a gift for the expected new arrival. When Percy and his mother chase the dog to retrieve the bonnet, Jane moves a piece of furniture and jeopardizes her pregnancy. Her physician fears she may lose the baby and her life, and Percy feels extremely guilty, thinking he has caused his mother to nearly die. Jane does recover and gives birth to a healthy son. An ecstatic Hiram has the entire family sit for Magel and a portrait.

Mafia, is an Italian American criminal organization based in California, as part of the American Mafia (or Cosa Nostra). Since its inception in the early 20th century, it has spread throughout Southern California. Like most Mafia families in the United States, the L.A. crime family gained power bootlegging alcohol during the Prohibition Era. The L.A. family reached its peak strength in the 1940s and early 1950s under Mickey Cohen, although the L.A. family was never larger than the New York or Chicago families. Since Mickey Cohen's decline, the Los Angeles crime family itself has been on a gradual decline, with the Chicago Outfit representing them on The Commission since the death of Boss Jack Dragna in 1956. The sources for much of the current information on the history of the Los Angeles Cosa Nostra family is the courtroom testimony and the published biographies of Aladena \\"Jimmy the Weasel\\" Fratianno, who in the late 1970s became the second member-and the first acting boss-in American Mafia history to testify against Mafia members, and The Last Mafioso (1981), a biography of Fratianno by Ovid Demaris. Since the 1980s, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO Act) has been effective in convicting mobsters and shrinking the American Mafia; like all families in the United States, the L.A. Mafia now only holds a fraction of its former power. Not having a strong concentration of Italian-Americans in the region leaves the family to contend with the many street gangs of other ethnicities in the city. The Los Angeles crime family is the last Mafia family left in the state of California. Origins and predecessors Los Angeles Times newspaper in 1917. Pictured in the top right corner are Sam Matranga and Tony Buccola. The drawing is a depiction of the murder of Pietro Matranga. The early years of organized crime in California were marked by the division of various Italian street gangs such as the Black Hand organizations in the early 20th century. The most prominent of these was the Matranga family. Their legitimate business was fruit vending. Otherwise they used threats, violence, arson, and extortion to control the Plaza area, which was the heart of the Italian American community of Los Angeles at the time. Its first leader was Orsario \\"Sam\\" Matranga, who started leading the family around 1905. Sam's relatives Salvatore Matranga, Pietro \\"Peter\\" Matranga, and Antonio \\"Tony\\" Matranga were other members of the gang. When prominent Black Hand leader Joseph Ardizzone was involved in a dispute with George Maisano, a member of the Matranga gang, they both went to Joseph Cuccia to mediate the dispute. Cuccia was a well-respected criminal amongst the underworld, who served as a translator in court for Italians who didn't speak English.Los Angeles Times, Shot Down as He is Driving September 26, 1906 This made him a well liked man in the Italian community. Cuccia was a relative of Ardizzone's and ruled in Ardizzone's favor, causing the Matrangas to threaten Cuccia. In response, Ardizzone shot and killed Maisano on July 2, 1906. Ardizzone then fled authorities and became a wanted fugitive. With Ardizzone gone, the Matrangas fulfilled their promise of revenge. On September 25, 1906 Cuccia was shot and killed, allegedly by Tony Matranga. With both Ardizzone and Cuccia gone, the Matrangas became the dominant criminal force in Italian Plaza community. To expand their power they began cooperating with the police. Giving up information on their enemies and receiving immunity for most of their crimes, the Matrangas were able to expand their power and influence. Ardizzone returned to Los Angeles in 1914 and resumed his feud with the Matranga family. Sam and his successor, Pietro \\"Peter\\" Matranga, were both murdered within 33 days of each other in 1917. Mike Marino (aka Mike Rizzo), an Ardizzone ally, was responsible for the murders.Warner, Richard N. \\"The First Mafia Boss of Los Angeles? The Mystery of Vito Di Giorgio, 1880–1922.\\" On The Spot Journal (Summer 2008), 46–54. While their next leader, cousin Tony Buccola was able to get revenge and kill Marino in 1919, many years of violence ruined the Matranga family. It was becoming clear that Ardizzone's faction was winning the war. With the rise of bootleggers in the 1920s, the Matranga's power declined and was eliminated with Buccola's disappearance in 1930. Vito Di Giorgio, a Black Handler and grocery store owner, moved to the United States from Palermo, Sicily in 1904, and to Los Angeles from New Orleans in 1920. With the continuing Ardizzone-Matranga feud, Di Giorgio was able to relocate to Los Angeles and bring some order to the Los Angeles underworld. Di Giorgio was known as an intimidating and forceful man who was in conflict with several local underworld factions. Di Giorgio maintained strong connections with mobsters in New Orleans, Colorado, and Chicago, and was a cousin, close friend, and mob associate of New York City mobster Giuseppe Morello, the first boss of the Morello crime family. He survived two attempts on his life before he was murdered in Chicago in 1922 while having a haircut. His underboss Rosario DeSimone, who moved from Pueblo, Colorado to Los Angeles around the same time as Di Giorgio, was another longtime power figure who stayed out of the city and operated bootlegging rackets quietly in Los Angeles County. DeSimone officially stepped down from the top position in the 1920s, but was still a power within the Los Angeles underworld. Albert Marco seized control of Los Angeles in the 1920s not by working with the local Mafia, but with the \\"City Hall Gang\\", a political machine in Los Angeles run by Kent Kane Parrot and Charles H. Crawford. This transformed Marco into the Vice Lord of Los Angeles, earning $500,000 from bordello prostitution alone. With Crawford and Parrot controlling city hall and the local press, the City Hall Gang was able to operate bootlegging, prostitution, and illegal gambling rackets in the shadows with little law enforcement scrutiny. This all changed when Marco was convicted of assault with a deadly weapon in 1928, and the City Hall Gang broke down after a reform movement swept L.A. in the late 1920s. Since then a host of mobsters fought to take control of liquor operations that Marco and the City Hall Gang previously dominated. In 1928, August Palumbo was the seventh bootlegger killed in a six-week period. Palumbo was Marco's former lieutenant and was killed for refusing to fall in line with DeSimone. DeSimone's lieutenant Dominic DiCiolla (aka Dominick De Soto) was acquitted of the murder and took control of Palumbo's liquor operations. When he tried to challenge higher powers by moving in on syndicated gambling rackets, he was murdered in 1931. History Jack Dragna in 1915 Joseph \\"Iron Man\\" Ardizzone returned to California in 1914 and was acquitted of murdering Maisano in 1915 due to lack of evidence and no witnesses willing to testify. He returned to power and quickly started expanding his rackets in Los Angeles. Ardizzone teamed up with Jack Dragna and they worked closely together for over 10 years. During prohibition the two were successful in running bootlegging operations in Southern California as well as gambling and extortion. By the end of the 1920s he was rapidly expanding his power and influence. Under Ardizzone's tenure, organized crime began consolidating under his banner as he dominated criminal activities in L.A. In the late 1920s, Dragna and Johnny Roselli constantly battled Charlie Crawford for control of the lucrative bootlegging rackets. With the deaths of Buccola and DiCiolla in 1930 and 1931, respectively, Ardizzone (who was a suspect in both murders) was the undisputed leader of crime in L.A. He set up the Italian Protective League, with Dragna as its president, Ardizzone as its vice president, and California State Senator Joseph Pedrotti as its Chairman. The organization had some political and social motives, but mostly served as a strong-arm muscle for the crime family. His reign as boss was ended when he mysteriously disappeared in 1931. Ardizzone was in conflict with the Mafia's National Crime Syndicate on the East Coast, leading to Ardizzone's elimination. =Dragna era= Louis Dragna, Tom Dragna, Frank Dragna, Girolamo \\"Momo\\" Adamo and Frank Paul Dragna Jack Dragna took control of the family after Ardizzone's death in 1931, and made peace with the National Mafia Syndicate. In addition, his brother Tom Dragna was made his consigliere while his nephew Louis Tom Dragna became a made man in 1947. Dragna was the most successful boss the L.A. family ever had. Although he wasn't able to infiltrate many of the labor unions in the entertainment industry, he involved the Los Angeles family in the entertainment business, and brought the L.A. Mafia onto the national stage. He was honored with a place on The Commission, the only boss west of Chicago to hold a spot on the council. When prohibition ended in 1933, Dragna operated a massive loan shark and illegal gambling business. Along with close supporter John Roselli, Dragna's Mafia family ended local gang wars by driving older gambling syndicate headed by Guy McAfee and Milton \\"Farmer\\" Page out of business. Dragna and Roselli worked with Joe Shaw (the brother of Mayor Frank Shaw) to muscle out L.A. bookies, many of whom fled to Las Vegas. By 1937, the Los Angeles crime family controlled the illegal gambling in Los Angeles. For independent bookmakers, Dragna would use extortion to collect money from their operations. While most mobsters simply threatened harm on a business for not paying tribute to their organization (protection racket), Dragna's family came up with a more sophisticated course of action. Dragna would send in men to threaten businesses, then the owners would pay Dragna for protection (unaware that these were Dragna's own men). Dragna wasn't however, able to control 100% of independent gambling rackets. Along with Dragna avoiding the spotlight and public life, he often was given the reputation as a weak ruler. According to Mickey Cohen, Dragna was very powerful and very well respected, but did not put things together the way the East Coast bosses preferred. Although there was not as big a pool of Italians to recruit on the West Coast like there was back East, the L.A. family worked around this by accepting members from across the country, such as Johnny Roselli from Chicago, Nick Licata from Detroit, and Aladena \\"Jimmy the Weasel\\" Fratianno and Dominic Brooklier from Cleveland. Armed with top hitman Frank Bompensiero and Jimmy Fratianno (who committed over 30 murders on the orders of their superiors), Dragna muscled his way into controlling territory stretching throughout California and Southern Nevada. The Dragna family also had connections within the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, who were more corrupt than the city police (LAPD). Note: First citation is on page 249, second citation is on page 236. Although not having a big hand in labor union rackets, the Dragna crime family did infiltrate some unions in the laundromat and dress importing business. Benjamin \\"Bugsy\\" Siegel moved to Los Angeles in 1937 and stayed on the West Coast until his death in 1947. When Lucky Luciano sent Benjamin \\"Bugsy\\" Siegel from New York City to Los Angeles to take control of their interests on the West Coast (including Las Vegas), he formed an uneasy partnership with Dragna. Siegel was able to get independent bookies to pay tribute to Dragna's already flourishing gambling business. Aside from this however, Dragna resented Siegel's power to infiltrate unions in the movie industry. Siegel made millions extorting movie production companies and only had to pay Dragna a tribute for working on his territory. With New York on Siegel's side, there was little Dragna could do to take control of The Commission's grip of the city. The main reason Siegel came to California was to organize a horse racing wire service on the West Coast for the National Syndicate, which Siegel and Dragna worked closely together on setting up. Dragna and Siegel tried many methods to take over Continental Press Service (the main wire service at the time). Attempts to buy out the company and to strong arm its owners didn't work, so they set up their own company called Trans-America. The Chicago Outfit eventually took over rival Continental Racing Services and gave the entire percentage of the racing wire on the West Coast to Dragna, enraging Siegel. Battle of Sunset Strip Once Siegel ran out of favor with New York, he was ordered to be killed. Although his murder officially remains unsolved, one theory is that Dragna's men were given the order to kill him. After Siegel's death, his chief lieutenant Mickey Cohen took over his remaining gambling and loan shark operations in Los Angeles. He refused to fall in line behind Dragna and Dragna saw this as an opportunity to eliminate him as Cohen began to create his own crime family that quickly began to rival Dragna's. Dragna first began recruiting Cohen's Italian men such as Dominic Brooklier to his family and killing his other men such as David Ogul, Frank Niccoli, Neddie Herbert, and Harold \\"Hooky\\" Rothman. However, through sheer luck, Cohen survived many attempts on his life (John Roselli compared Cohen to Bugs Moran). In 1951, Cohen was imprisoned for tax evasion and the L.A. family moved in on his gambling business. The number of high-profile murders and gangsters moving into the West Coast, combined with the recall of Mayor Frank L. Shaw because of corruption charges related to organized crime, caused law enforcement to stop accommodating the Mafia. In the late 1930s, California Attorney General Earl Warren took command of a tough assault on Dragna's empire, most notably shutting down the gambling ships run by Anthony Cornero. On February 14, 1950, the California Commission on Organized Crime singled out Dragna as the head of a crime syndicate that controlled crime in Southern California. Soon after, several of his family members were arrested for the bombing of Mickey Cohen's home. Dragna fled the state and was wanted for questioning. He later surrendered, and was questioned in the Kefauver hearings along with Roselli and Bompensiero, but denied all accusations against him. Dragna's family however, remain strong throughout the early 1950s. =DeSimone and Licata= Frank DeSimone (left) and John Roselli. While other Mafia families in the country were prospering in the 1950s, the L.A. family was beginning its decline. When William H. Parker became Chief of Police for the Los Angeles Police Department in 1950, the police started cracking down on organized crime instead of assisting it. The weakened Los Angeles family lost ground to the Chicago Outfit and New York families. Due to over 50 unsolved gangland killings in the first half of the century, the L.A.P.D. formed a special task force to deal with the problem: \\"The Gangster Squad\\". This group of men harassed Dragna's family, as well as Cohen's throughout the 1950s. Frank Bompensiero and Jimmy Fratianno started serving prison sentences in 1953 and 1954, respectively. In 1956 Jack Dragna died of a heart attack and a vote was made by the senior members of the family to elect its new boss. Johnny Roselli was seen as the most logical choice, but lawyer-turned-gangster Frank DeSimone was victorious. A disappointed Roselli, who felt that DeSimone rigged the election, transferred back to the Chicago Outfit. Fratianno did the same after his release from prison in 1960. With Dragna gone and his brother Tom retired after his death, the crime family slipped out of control. It quickly became apparent that DeSimone was an incompetent boss. According to an unidentified informant, he raped the wife of former underboss Girolamo \\"Momo\\" Adamo, which caused Adamo to shoot his wife (who survived) and kill himself. This meant the top three men from Dragna's era, the boss, underboss, and consigliere were all inactive in Los Angeles almost immediately after DeSimone took charge. DeSimone was present at the ill-fated Apalachin Meeting with his underboss Simone Scozzari. When the meeting was raided by police, DeSimone was outed as a mobster. He previously had no arrest record and was believed to be a simple lawyer. Scozzari came under law enforcement scrutiny after the meeting and was deported to Italy in 1962 for being an illegal immigrant. By 1965, it was estimated that the number of members of the L.A. family living in Los Angeles dwindled to 30, while the family actually had a strong presence in San Diego. DeSimone worried about \\"shaking down\\" gamblers and bookmakers for fear that they would run to the police. In the 1960s, Bonanno crime family Boss Joseph Bonanno plotted to have DeSimone killed for failing to exploit the criminal opportunities in Los Angeles. The plan was thwarted, but caused DeSimone to become very paranoid, never leaving his house at night. DeSimone's unsuccessful reign concluded with his death in 1967, after 11 years in power. DeSimone's second underboss Nick \\"Old Man\\" Licata succeeded him. Licata had strong ties with Mafia families in the Midwest and South and maintained contact with the mob in Las Vegas. By then, law enforcement knew much about mob activities in Los Angeles, which was helped by top hitman Frank Bompensiero becoming an undercover informant in 1967. In 1963 Joe Valachi outed the Mafia as a secret criminal society, aiding in law enforcements attacks on organized crime and fingered Licata as a high ranking mobster in Los Angeles. A bright spot during the period was that Louis Tom Dragna's company \\"Roberta Dress Manufacturing\\" was turning into a $10 million a year business. This was possible because in the 1950s, Jack Dragna flew labor union expert Johnny Dio in from New York City to teach Louis how to manipulate labor unions in the Los Angeles Garment District. Licata had high hopes of restoring the declining family, but with the police and FBI constantly monitoring his family, Licata wasn't able to do much of a better job than DeSimone. On July 9, 1969 Licata was taken into custody after refusing to answer questions at a federal grand jury session about L.A.'s crime syndicate structure. He was held in contempt of court for refusing to testify after being given immunity from prosecution and eventually served six months in prison. A pair of indictments in the mid-1970s threaten to put most of the working family in prison. In March 1973, seven men were arrested for running a rigged gambling operation in Los Angeles that brought in up to $250,000 a month. Their trial was delayed when the key informant and witness, former Mafia associate John Dubcek, was shot and killed in Las Vegas. Although this scared other informants from testifying, they still were convicted and given light sentences. Four months later another 12 men, were indicted for conspiracy, racketeering and extortion against bookmakers, loan sharks, and pornographers. Licata's underboss Joseph Dippolito had a large influence in San Bernardino and the Inland Empire in both legitimate and criminal enterprises. He was seen as Licata's successor, but died unexpectedly of a heart attack in January 1974 at the age of 59. On October 19, 1974, after a long battle with illnesses, Nick Licata died at age 77. =Fratianno flips= Longtime members Jimmy Fratianno (left) and Frank Bompensiero rose to become acting boss and consigliere, respectively, of the LA family in the 1970s. Licata's successor, Dominic Brooklier, was initially able to stabilize the family's businesses, but later endured considerable damage done by FBI informants. Brooklier was able to make a lot of money in pornography, extortion, and drugs, but wasn't able to take back control of many independent bookmaking rackets in Los Angeles. The Last Mafioso described several instances during the time when the Los Angeles family would shake down movie producers in the porn industry. These producers would then pay a fee to their Mafia backers, usually on the East Coast, to set things straight with the L.A. mob. Once the producers paid, the Mafia backers would secretly split the money with the L.A. family. Brooklier later ordered the death of Frank Bompensiero for his growing criticism of the family, and later finding good evidence that Bompensiero was cooperating with the FBI. When Brooklier was sentenced to a 20-month prison stint along with underboss Samuel Sciortino in 1975, Jimmy Fratianno on Tom Dragna's request, transferred back to the L.A. family from Chicago, and was named co-acting Los Angeles boss with Dragna. Fratianno traveled across the country making new connections and deals. Fratianno's goal was to bring back the ailing L.A. family stature and reputation amongst the Mafia. Since Jack Dragna's 1956 death, Los Angeles was starting to be seen as an \\"open city\\" where any Mafia family could do business, but Fratianno hoped that by restoring the ailing family, he would be a candidate to officially run the family after Brooklier was released. However, upon release from prison, Brooklier quickly took back control of the family, and Fratianno was left back to being a low level soldier. The fall of the Los Angeles family came when Fratianno became the second American Mafioso to turn state's evidence and testify against the Mafia in court. On October 6, 1977, Danny Greene was killed by a car bomb in Ohio, and Ray Ferritto was arrested for the murder. Ferritto implicated Fratianno in the planning of the murder, and Fratianno was indicted for charges related to the bombing. Fearing for his safety, Fratianno agreed to become a government witness against the Mafia. In return for his testimony, he pleaded guilty to the murder charges and received a five-year prison sentence, of which he served 21 months. In 1980, after testifying for the government that led to the racketeering convictions of five reputed Mafia figures, Fratianno entered the federal Witness Protection Program. Fratianno claimed that the Mafia had a $100,000 contract on his life. Brooklier, who didn't trust Fratianno, ordered the hit because Fratianno had claimed he was presenting himself as boss of the family, and felt that he was trying to usurp him. Fratianno testified against mobsters not only in Los Angeles, but across the entire country. Although the Justice Department thought it finally crippled the Mafia in Los Angeles, a Federal Judge gave Brooklier, Sciortino, Michael Rizzitello, Dragna, and Jack LoCicero light sentences ranging from two to five years in 1981 for racketeering and extortion. Brooklier still ran the family from his prison cell until he died of a heart attack in 1984. With Brooklier's imprisonment, capo Peter Milano quickly stepped up and began running the family in 1981. =The Milano brothers= Peter Milano was officially made boss of the Los Angeles crime family with Brooklier's death in 1984. He made his brother Carmen \\"Flipper\\" Milano his underboss. Since Milano's reign, the family was heavily involved in narcotics, pornography, gambling and loan sharking. 20 reputed organized crime figures were arrested in 1984, in what law enforcement officials said was a bid to take over a $1 million-a-week bookmaking operation in Los Angeles. Neither of the Milano brothers (nor six of the others originally arrested) were charged due to lack of evidence. When Peter Milano became boss, he rejuvenated the depleted family by inducting new members such as Stephen \\"Steve the Whale\\" Cino, singer Charles \\"Bobby Milano\\" Caci, Luigi \\"Louie\\" Gelfuso Jr. and shylock brothers Lawrence and Anthony \\"The Animal\\" Fiato into the family. Mobster turned informant Kenny Gallo credited the brothers with \\"help[ing] Pete Milano revamp the L.A. Family\\". With a beefed up family Milano succeeded in having nearly every bookie in Los Angeles pay a mob tax to the L.A. family. Robert \\"Puggy\\" Zeichick gave Anthony Fiato a $1 million loan which was used to finance a huge loan shark operation. The L.A. family became the dominant loan shark operators in the area. The family's influence stretched all the way to Las Vegas, where they had long standing ties to what the Mafia considered an \\"open city\\" where any family could work. The entire hierarchy of the family including the Milano brothers, captains Mike Rizzitello, Jimmy Caci, and Luigi Gelfuso along with many other mobsters were arrested on various charges in the late 1980s, due largely to information and recordings collected by the Fiato brothers. These charges to so many members permanently crippled the family and put the family on the brink of extinction. While Rizzitello, who was acquitted of his original charges at trial, was sentenced to 33 years in prison in 1989 for attempted murder (where he would die in 2005) the Milano brothers plead guilty to lesser charges; Peter received a six-year prison sentence and Carmen received six months. Almost every member of the family charged pleaded guilty to receive lesser sentences and the F.B.I. considered the Mafia finished in Los Angeles. However, since Peter Milano's paroled release in 1991, he took back control of the weakened family. The Los Angeles family since made moves into Las Vegas with the Buffalo crime family. The family made headlines again with the murder of Chicago Outfit associate Herbert \\"Fat Herbie\\" Blitzstein by Buffalo and Los Angeles family associates in 1997. Blizstein had a lucrative loan shark and auto insurance fraud business the two families moved in to take over. This caused a great deal of scrutiny from the FBI on both families. Members like Stephen Cino and Alfred Mauriello were convicted on related charges along with other associates who cooperated with officials to receive a reduced sentence, putting the L.A. crime family on its last leg.Organized Crime Loses its Foothold Las Vegas Sun, July 2, 2002. Retrieved December 2, 2009 By the 1990s the L.A. family was estimated to have 20 official members. =Latest position= Much of the crime family's activities have become unknown since the Las Vegas indictments. Law enforcement has moved its attention of organized crime towards street gangs such as Mexican and Asian gangs who are far more prevalent and widespread. Until his death, Peter Milano was still believed to be the official Boss of the Los Angeles crime family. However, since the late 1990s, his involvement in crime along with other members had become greatly reduced. Some members, like Rocco Zangari and Russell Massetia, moved out of the state and left the family altogether. Other members, like Carmen Milano and Jimmy Caci died of old age with no younger people having to replace them. Los Angeles doesn't have a high concentration of Italians like the East Coast to support them, so recruiting new members is challenging. With Southern California's many racial groups, the Cosa Nostra faced an uphill battle to challenge the many street gangs in the area over criminal rackets. Law enforcement also considers East Coast Mafia members moving to California as a threat.

Education He trained for 15 years in New York under the finest teachers: Lee Strasberg, Stella Adler, Uta Hagen, Harold Clurman, Sanford Meisner. He was an Honors graduate of the American Academy of Dramatic Arts (New York) and a Senior Life Member of the Actors Studio (New York and Hollywood). He received a B.A. from both the University of Hawaii and the University of London.'THE MOVIEGOER': \\"Fijian Noble Stars in New Movie\\". The Deseret News. May 28, 1970. 8D. Early life Manu Tupou was born on Lomaloma, Lau, Fiji Islands. After completing his studies at the University of Hawaii on a U.S. government scholarship, he began studying at the University of London on a BBC scholarship. On a summer vacation his girlfriend told him that he fit the description for a casting ad in the local newspaper. When he arrived, casting director Marion Dougherty pulled out a picture she had acquired from the Fiji Visitor Bureau. On a lark, he had posed with Dinah Shore's stand-in, who was in Fiji working on a network Christmas special. The picture became a poster which adorned the wall of the Fiji airport. When Dougherty and director George Roy Hill saw it, they knew they had found their man. When they asked the Fiji Visitor's Bureau where they could find this young man, they were told that he was of great importance (as he was part of the royal of family of Tonga and quite noteworthy of a person on the island). The Bureau told them that he was in Hawaii on vacation for school. Dougherty and Hill went off to Hawaii to find him, so by the time he arrived at the address in the ad they were expecting him. He auditioned and they both felt they had found their Prince. But Tupou declined as he was starting school in a couple of days. He went back to London. After a couple of weeks he got a call from an authoritative voice. \\"Be ready at 9:00 a.m.\\" The producers of the film persisted. A limousine was waiting for him. The driver paid his rent and took him to the BBC. It was here that the chairman of the BBC told Tupou he would keep his scholarship open for two years. He then was fitted for a suit, given a fistful of cash and sent to the airport where he flew to Hollywood to go to Samuel Goldwyn Studios. He arrived on the set of Hawaii, where he got his start in movies. Thus began his career. While staying with Dougherty in New York he was introduced to Lee Strasberg. The Actors Studio In New York, he studied at Carnegie Hall at the Actors Studio with the likes of Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, and Shelley Winters. It was here began to develop himself as an artist. He began working on movies and television shows and even Broadway. It was here in New York that he studied with the greats of the time, later to develop his own technique. This technique was developed from what he learned and the mistakes he felt he made from using sense memory, which he felt damaged his sanity due to the use of past moments of pain and unconsciousness. New Era Acting Technique Gleaning true knowledge and workable applications from his extensive educational experience in the arts, Manu Tupou formulated his discoveries into the simplistic, but revolutionary, \\"New Era Acting Technique\\" (NEAT). The hallmark of the NEAT technique is its respect for the sanctity and sanity of the individual artist- upgrading the artist's creation away from the limitations of memory and recalled past experiences, into a more redeeming and uplifting \\"slice of life,\\" happening here and now in present time. This was the major difference in approach from the way his mentor Lee Strasberg taught Tupou and his classmates. One of the main philosophies behind the technique is that each talent is a unique essence unto itself- and also the most important, single, irreducible creative element in any production. Also equally unique (almost without exception), each talent observed will be found to have his own \\"working problem\\" as a creative artist. Small or large, the working problem can effectively sabotage any actor's creative abilities, and hence, their career. Tupou an important aspect was not only to correctly and accurately identify the working problem of an actor but more importantly providing a workable route by which such problems could be overcome through understanding and improved artistic ability.

He wanted to have the luxury of giving anywhere from 15 minutes, and sometimes even up to one hour, of feedback and critiques. This was highly effective, ensuring the next time that student came to class and put up his work, it was taken to the next level. Tupou trained Eric Roberts, Ernie Reyes Jr., Calvin Levels, Santino Ramos, Jerri Manthey, Kath Soucie, and Arash Dibazar, among others. He died of pancreatic cancer in 2004.

It was located in \\"The Hub\\" in the South Bronx, at the intersection of 149th Street, Third Avenue, Willis Avenue, and Melrose Avenue. Opened as an express station in 1887 and later operating as the line's southern terminus, the station closed in 1973 and was demolished by 1977 due to political pressure in the area. Station layout The station was built as an express station, with three tracks and two island platforms; the center express track was completed by 1916. North of the station, a spur track curved from Third Avenue east onto Westchester Avenue (150th Street) to connect with the IRT White Plains Road Line. A signal tower was located in between the mainline and the spur track. After it became the line's southern terminal in 1955, the center track was removed and the platforms were connected into one large island platform. A diamond crossover switch was installed north of the station to relay terminating trains. History The Hub in Bronx at the north end of the former station, 35 years after it closed. The station was originally opened on June 16, 1887 by the Suburban Rapid Transit Company. On July 10, 1905, the underground Third Avenue–149th Street station of the IRT White Plains Road Line (which fed into the Lenox Avenue and West Side subways) was opened, and free transfers were provided between the two stations. In October 1911, the 149th Street Crosstown Trolley Line between Longwood and Harlem opened (the predecessor to the current Bx19 bus), in addition to the Third Avenue trolley line of the Third Avenue and Union Railway system. Between 1913 and 1916 during the Dual Contracts, the center track was added to facilitate express service along the line. Around this time, the name \\"The Hub of the Bronx\\" emerged due to the area's status as a major transportation, commercial, and amusement center. In 1921, a seven-car train derailed crossing the spur track north of the station, destroying a control tower and causing a fire on the trestle. Thirty passengers were injured, and the second of the wooden elevated cars was damaged beyond repair. On May 12, 1955, the Third Avenue elevated was closed south of 149th Street, ending service on the line between the Bronx and Manhattan. 149th Street station became the southern terminus of the Third Avenue Line. In the 1960s under the Program For Action, the city planned to close the remainder of the line, which fell into disrepair and was credited for blight in the area. The station closed on April 29, 1973 and was demolished in 1977. Current status From 1973 to 2013, the Bx55 limited bus replaced elevated service between The Hub and Gun Hill Road. Free transfers, first via a paper transfer and later by MetroCard, were given between the bus and the 149th Street subway station. In 2013, the Bx55 was eliminated, replaced by the Bx15 limited bus which terminates at Fordham Plaza.

It was located at Fordham Road and Third Avenue, one block east of Webster Avenue, in the modern location of Fordham Plaza. Opened in 1901, the station was closed in 1973 and demolished in 1977 along with the rest of the Third Avenue Line. No trace of the station exists today. History left An extension of the Third Avenue El to Fordham Square (now Fordham Plaza) was proposed in 1894. The station opened on July 1, 1901, as part of a three station extension of the line north of Tremont Avenue–177th Street. It was originally called Pelham Avenue, the former name of Fordham Road and Pelham Parkway. It served as a major transfer point to what is today the Metro-North Railroad's Harlem and New Haven Lines at the Fordham station, and St. John's College (now the main Rose Hill campus of Fordham University). This station served as the terminus of the line until May 21, 1902, when it was extended to Bronx Park Terminal. Between 1913 and 1916 under the Dual Contracts, a third track was added to the line to facilitate express service. Express service began on January 17, 1916. A second extension to Gun Hill Road along Webster Avenue was also built during the Dual Contracts, opening in 1920. The station had three tracks and two island platforms, situated on the west side of Third Avenue. North of the station, the mainline curved from Third Avenue onto Webster Avenue, while the stub line towards Bronx Park ran along the western edge of the Fordham campus parallel to the Metro-North tracks. The split occurred at an at-grade junction at about East 194th Street. The next local stop to the north was either Bronx Park (closed in 1951) or 200th Street. The next express stop to the north was the terminus of the line at Gun Hill Road. The next stop to the south was 183rd Street for local trains and Tremont Avenue–177th Street for express trains. In the 1970s, the city planned to close the elevated line, which was dilapidated and blamed for blight and ills in the borough. The station closed on April 29, 1973. The structure was demolished by 1977. Service to the station and along the Third Avenue corridor was replaced by Bx55 buses. Current status From 1973 to 2013, the Bx55 limited bus replaced elevated service between The Hub and Gun Hill Road. In 2013, the Bx55 was eliminated, replaced by the Bx15 limited bus which terminates at Fordham Plaza. Service to Gun Hill Road is provided by the Bx41 Select Bus Service route along Webster Avenue.bx41 sbs starting in June 2013 in mta board meeting packet pages 7.6-7.16 Currently, the station site is occupied by Fordham Plaza, a major bus hub and commercial center. While the plaza has existed in some form since the 1910s, the current plaza was constructed in the mid-1990s, and has been undergoing reconstruction since 2014. The closest subway stop to the former station is Fordham Road on the IND Concourse Line six blocks west.

In 1920, Vacquier escaped the Russian Civil War with his family, taking a horse-drawn sleigh across the ice of the Gulf of Finland to Helsinki, then moving to France and (in 1923) to the United States. He received a B.S. in electrical engineering in 1927 from the University of Wisconsin, and a master's degree in physics in 1929, but never earned a Ph.D. He worked for Gulf Research Laboratories, the research arm of Gulf Oil, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and then during World War II he moved to the Airborne Instruments Laboratory at Columbia University, where he applied the fluxgate magnetometer, an instrument he had invented at Gulf, to submarine detection. Following the war, he worked at Sperry Gyroscope Inc. developing gyrocompasses; then in 1953 he moved to the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, where he worked on groundwater detection. At Scripps, where he moved in 1957, he directed a program that used his war-surplus flux magnetometers to measure the patterns formed by the Earth's magnetic field on the sea floor; his discovery of large shifts in the patterns in the Mendocino Fracture Zone was a major impetus behind the theory of plate tectonics,. which his later measurements of heat flow on the sea floor also strongly supported.

It was notable that these victories included three opposing aces shot down within the same week in September 1918-David Putnam, Maurice Boyau, and Joseph Wehner.The Aerodrome website's page on Hantelmann http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/germany/hantelmann.php Retrieved 11 February 2013. Early life and service Georg von Hantelmann was born into a minor Junker family on 9 October 1898. He was born in Rokietnice, Kingdom of Prussia, the German Empire (present day Rokietnica, Poland). He was the eldest son. He joined the army in 1916. He was commissioned as a Leutnant on 15 June 1917 before he transferred to aerial service with the Luftstreitkräfte. Aerial service Hantelmann began training at FEA 9 on 20 September 1917. Upon graduation from this basic aviation training, he moved on to learn to fly a fighter plane at the Jastaschule in Valenciennes, France. His initial assignment as a fighter pilot took him to Jagdstaffel 18, commanded by Rudolf Berthold, on 6 February 1918.Franks et al 1993, pp. 123-124. When Berthold changed commands on 18 March 1918 to take charge of Jagdstaffel 15, he took many of his pilots with him in a highly unusual mass exchange of personnel. Hantelmann was one of the pilots who accompanied Berthold to the new unit. Once he arrived at his new squadron, Hantelmann had his personal insignia of a \\"totenkopf\\"-style skull and crossbones painted on the fuselage sides of his Albatros D.V reflected his prior service in the 17th Braunschweig \\"Death's Head\\" Hussar Regiment. Hantelmann posted his first victory claim on 29 May 1918, but it went unconfirmed. Thus, on June 6, when Jasta 15 dove into battle, he was eager for success.Homes, Wyllie 2004 p. 60. As his squadron- mate Joachim von Ziegsar recalled, \\"Like a steer unbound, the aircraft with the Braunschweig Hussar's crest dived onto the enemy first.\\"Franks, VanWyngarden 2003, p. 32. A British Airco DH.4 fell before the young Prussian's guns. It was the first of five wins in June; on the 26th, Hantelmann became an ace. It was during this period that Kurt Wüsthoff borrowed Hantelmann's Fokker and flew his final mission.VanWyngarden 2004, p. 53. Hantlemann scored again on 17 August, but it was his second victory on 12 September 1918 that was notable. Hantlemann shot down American SPAD S.XIII pilot David Putnam, a leading ace of the nascent US Army Air Service who had 13 victories of his own, for victory number eight. Just four days and six wins later, Hantlemann scored an even more notable triumph when he shot down French ace Maurice Boyau, who had a score list of 21 balloons and 14 airplanes. Two days and two victories after that, Hantlemann shot down Frank Luke's wingman, Joseph Wehner, for number 16. The young German ace ended September with 18 victories. On 21 October 1918, the day of his 22nd confirmed victory, Hantelmann was awarded the Iron Cross First Class, as well as the Royal House Order of Hohenzollern. He was now past the 20 victories then required for the award of Germany's highest decoration for valor, the Pour le Merite.Pour le Merite website http://www.pourlemerite.org/ Retrieved 11 February 2013. Hantelmann was recommended for the Blue Max on 3 November 1918. However, the German Empire's defeat scotched the award. Nevertheless, Hantlemann ended the war with 25 confirmed and 5 unconfirmed aerial victories. All of his confirmed victories were on the Fokker D.VII, making him one of the most successful pilots in the type. Postwar life Hantelmann settled on a farm in Charcice, Prussia. On 7 September 1924, Polish poachers crossed the nearby border, and murdered Hantelmann when he discovered them trespassing on his property.

V. RamasamyA biographical sketch (, ) (17 September 1879 – 24 December 1973), also known as Ramaswami, EVR, Thanthai Periyar, or Periyar, was a Dravidian social reformer and politician from India, who founded the Self-Respect Movement and Dravidar Kazhagam.Thakurta, Paranjoy Guha and Shankar Raghuraman (2004) A Time of Coalitions: Divided We Stand, Sage Publications. New Delhi, p. 230. He wanted thinking people to realize that their society was far from perfect and that it is in urgent need of reform. Periyar wanted the Government, the political parties and social workers to identify the evils in society and boldly adopt measures to remove them.Gopalakrishnan, Periyar: Father of the Tamil race, p. 66. Philosophy Periyar's philosophy did not differentiate social and political service.Saraswathi. Towards Self-Respect, pp. 164 & 165. According to him, the first duty of a government is to run the social organization efficiently, and that the philosophy of religion was to organize the social system. Conditions appeared to him such that the government was not for the people, but, in a \\"topsy-turvey\\" manner, the people were for the government. He attributed this situation to the state of the social system contrived for the advantage of a small group of people. Therefore, Periyar was of the view that for the progress of the people in the country, great social changes were necessary and a good government could be formed only after making those changes. He thought that under the existing social system, there was and there could be no means of removing the hardships of the people even to a small extent, regardless of who came to power. In his real life he was a victim of caste discrimination. Rural Upliftment One of the areas of focus was in the upliftment of villages. In a booklet called Village Uplift, Periyar plead for rural reform. It should be stressed in this context that rural India still forms the largest part of the Indian subcontinent in spite of the ongoing process of urbanization. Thus, the distinction between rural and urban has meant an economic and social degradation for the rural inhabitant. Periyar wanted to eradicate the concept of \\"village\\" as a discrimination word among places just as the concept outcast among social groups. Periyar advocated for a location where neither the name nor the situation or its conditions imply differences among people.Diehl, E.V. Ramasamy Naiker-Siriyar, p. 68. With the same aim in view, Periyar wanted farm laborers to be called \\"partakers in agriculture\\" and be paid 60 percentSaraswathi. Towards Self-Respect, p. 192. of the income, while 40 percent would go to the landowner. In his booklet on rural uplift of 1944, Periyar gave an action program for modernizing villages which mentioned: mechanization of agriculture, that is, ploughing, sowing, digging wells, and harvesting by machines; reformulation of agricultural land to facilitate mechanization and separation of land unsuitable for this for growing other crops; marketing of agricultural products, through farmers' cooperative so that the proceeds would go to the agriculturists; combining villages as a small town for provision of a school, hospital, park, cinema, drama, reading room, library, radio station, roads, bus transport, police station, an educated judge, and shops; organizing mobile exhibitions; establishing appeals courts and providing for field camp of officers for redressal of grievances; and establishing small industries.Saraswathi. Towards Self-Respect, p. 193. Periyar and the Self-Respect Movement wanted to reduce Government salaries because they spoiled men's purity. He explained that they want industries producing things necessary for public welfare to be state-owned.Diehl, E.V. Ramasamy Naiker-Periyar, pp. 68 & 69. Furthermore, cooperative societies should be introduced to remove the brokers and moneylenders that come between farmers and consumers. Farmers must be helped to get rid of their debts. Litigation and conflicts on account of rules should be reduced and death taxes fixed. Periyar also believed that local boards, municipalities, and cooperative managements must be given more power.Diehl, E.V. Ramasamy Naiker- Periyar, p. 69. In his rural uplift, he puts every stress on education as the sure way to rational thinking and action which would lead to the abolishment of injustices in society, economic as well as social.Veeramani, Collected Works of Periyar, p. 26. Periyar came up with a fourteen-point program which were as follows: \\"the landless agriculturists should be safeguarded from exploitation by landlords and money lenders, where the government should do everything to see that agricultural workers are not deprived of their scroll land holdings for defaulting payment of rent; co-operative societies and banks should be formed to save the farmers from the exorbitant rate of interest collected by pawnbrokers and money lenders; to reduce the number of cases arising out of the dispute of the ownership of land the Government should itself possess all clear land documents; the laws pertaining to agriculture should be so framed that the actual agricultural laborers get reasonable returns for their labor, and to prevent landlords and middle-men from cornering away the bulk of the agricultural products; like railways, post and telegraphs, waterways and electricity which are now under the control of Government, the other public utilities and services should be taken over by the Government; insurance schemes should be undertaken by the Government itself and to be extended to workers as in the case of other people; legislation should be so framed as to increase the income of public as well as the workers with a view to upgrade their standard of living under income ratio; children should be given facilities for education within the target period;Veeramani, Collected Works of Periyar, p. 28. considering the baneful influence of toddy and other kinds of drink, the government should work towards total prohibition before a specified period of time; the evils of untouchability, discrimination based on birth, superstition and blind belief should be done away with; State Government appointments should be apportioned according to the percentage of population of people and political aspirations; land tax should be levied progressively taxing the rich more and leaving the poor from the rigorous clutches of tax; opportunities to get revenue in the case of local bodies and co-operatives should be enlarged and the management should be vested with the Government servants; and the motto of the public administration should aim at efficiency and a good administration with reasonable expenditure. Periyar sent a copy of these resolutions to the government and political parties, including the Congress. The Congress ignored these resolutions because they had come from Periyar and his party. But the Justice Party accepted the resolutions and assured Periyar that it would implement those resolutions, when administrative power came into its hands. The acceptance of the resolutions by the Justice Party was indeed a victory for Periyar's Self-Respect Movement.  Notes  Dravidian movement Social history of Tamil Nadu Periyar E. V.

Football career Turner was born in Brithdir, Caerphilly and after playing for minor clubs, Bargoed and Caerphilly, he joined Merthyr Town in May 1922. In his first season, he played at centre forward for the Football League Third Division South club and was their top scorer with twelve goals from forty appearances. Herbert Lewis \\"Bert\\" Turner, to whom he was not related, played alongside him at inside left, scoring five. For the following season, the players swapped positions with Bert moving into the centre, but Ernest continued to outscore his namesake, with fifteen goals to Bert's five. In 1924–25 season, both players struggled to find the net contributing five goals each, as Merthyr finished at the foot of the table, but were re-elected to the Football League for the following season. During his time with Merthyr, he was selected to represent the Welsh F.A. on several occasions. After three seasons with Merthyr, Turner moved to southern England in May 1925 to join Southampton in the Second Division. In his one season at The Dell, Turner failed to hold down a regular position and played at both inside-forward positions as well as centre-forward generally as a replacement for the long-serving Arthur Dominy and Bill Rawlings. He made sixteen appearances, scoring three goals, in the 1925–26 season before deciding to emigrate to Canada in May 1926.

The system is essentially free except for small, often symbolic co-payments in some products and services. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, total health spending accounted for 9.4% of GDP in Spain in 2011, slightly above the OECD average of 9.3%. The Spanish health care system is ranked as the 7th best healthcare in the world, as indicated in the year 2000 in a report by the World Health Organization.World Health Organization, World Health Staff, (2000), Haden, Angela; Campanini, Barbara, eds., The world health report 2000 - Health systems: improving performance (PDF), Geneva, Switzerland: World Health Organization, Spain's healthcare system ranks 19th in Europe according to the 2018 Euro health consumer index. Spain is ranked 1st in the world in organ transplants. The public sector is the main source of health funding. In Spain, 73% of health spending was funded by public sources in 2011, very close to the average of 72% in OECD countries. Since 2010, real term spending on healthcare has declined in Spain. Hospitals In an emergency, people can go straight to a hospital A&E.; For any other type of hospital treatment a referral from a doctor is required. There are public and private hospitals, with the former providing free treatment. As some hospitals offer both private and state healthcare services, the presentation of a social security card, an EHIC, or proof of private insurance is advisable. As hospital doctors do not issue prescriptions, after discharge, patients take the hospital medical report to a pharmacy for prescriptions to be filled. In Spain patients have the right to read their own patient records, but there is evidence that this is not well publicized. Decentralization In Spain, provision of health care services is decentralized, and thus the responsibility of several autonomous communities. In 1998, an analysis of the effects of greater autonomy on legislative performance and policy outcomes for health care observed a positive effect on the former, but no effect on the latter. The analysis noted that a possible explanation for this disconnect was that autonomous communities had only experienced greater autonomy in the area of health care for a short time, and positive effects on policy outcomes could take longer to manifest. In 2009, an analysis of data collected by the Spanish National Health Survey in 2001 showed that autonomous communities with decentralized health services tended to have better equity performance. In 2014, an analysis of data collected by the Spanish Centre of Sociological Research between 1996 and 2009 found that for twenty variables of public satisfaction with health care services, decentralization not only had no effect on 2 measures of primary or specialized care and 1 of hospital care, but actually performed worse on 3 measures of primary or specialized care and 1 measure of hospital care. No statistically significant trend was observed for twelve of the twenty measures of satisfaction. The authors of the analysis stressed that the data was limited due to the subjective nature of patient reports, and the possible inability of some to properly evaluate performance of health care services. International comparisons According to the World Economic Forum and to Bloomberg, Spain has the most efficient health system in Europe, and also ranks at the top worldwide along with Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore. In a sample of 13 developed countries Spain was second in its population weighted usage of medication in 14 classes in both 2009 and 2013. The drugs studied were selected on the basis that, in the previous 10 years the conditions treated had: a high incidence, prevalence and/or mortality; caused significant long-term morbidity; incurred high levels of expenditure or had significant developments in prevention or treatment. The study noted considerable difficulties in cross border comparison of medication use. Ceuta had the highest proportion of practicing doctors per head of any region in Europe - 871 per 100,000 in 2015. The Euro health consumer index rated Spain 19th of 35 European countries in 2015, remarking that there was somewhat of an over-reliance on seeking private care.  Public Opinion on Spain's Healthcare System  According to Van der Schee et al., public opinion about a country's healthcare system is formed by the levels and quality of: trust between a person and their physician, media presentation of the healthcare system as a whole, and the services and care the system provides.Gille, Felix & Smith, Sarah & Mays, Nicholas. (2017). Towards a broader conceptualisation of ‘public trust’ in the health care system. Social Theory & Health. 15. 25–43. When looking at public opinion on Spain's universal healthcare system, generally people seem to agree that the state should be heavily involved in healthcare. Compared to 14 other nations in 2002, Spain ranked third highest for the amount of support the public had for a strong role of the government in healthcare.Claus Wendt, Jürgen Kohl, Monika Mischke, Michaela Pfeifer; How Do Europeans Perceive Their Healthcare System? Patterns of Satisfaction and Preference for State Involvement in the Field of Healthcare, European Sociological Review, Volume 26, Issue 2, 1 April 2010, Pages 177–192, https://doi.org/10.1093/esr/jcp014 In terms of public opinion concerning how well the healthcare system actually works, there is a general consensus that the public believes healthcare institutions themselves are doing their jobs well and providing sufficient care. The most overwhelming problem reported by people who took a 2005 survey was that wait times to receive care are too long, though those surveyed reported that this problem could be fixed by the hiring of more physicians.  Voluntary Health Insurance  Although Spain does have universal health care, it is not the only source of protection available to the Spanish people. In fact, there are three alternatives to relying solely on the provided universal health care: substitutive voluntary health insurance, complementary voluntary health insurance, and supplementary voluntary health insurance. People who work in Spain's public sector are free to opt out of universal health care entirely if they agree to utilize the alternative: a government-subsidized health insurance called MUFACE. This selection of using different health insurance instead of Spain's universal health care is an example of substitutive voluntary health insurance. Complementary voluntary health insurance comes into play with citizens who use Spain's universal health care but still want additional private insurance to cover services which may not be protected under the universal plan. While Spain's universal health care covers a substantial amount including many basic primary and pharmaceutical services, it fails to cover various important dental and gynecological services among other things. If a Spanish citizen is seeking care outside that which is covered by the state, they have the option to purchase their own private health insurance to ensure that they are covered for any services they may need. Lastly, supplementary voluntary health insurance is an option for those Spanish citizens who use the available universal health care, but would also like additional private insurance which may provide them superior options/benefits. In this case, having supplementary voluntary health insurance is a luxury that often helps people secure faster, more convenient, or better overall treatment. According to the OECD, about 5% of the Spanish population was covered by one of the above types of voluntary health insurance in 2002.Colombo, F. and N. Tapay (2004), \\"Private Health Insurance in OECD Countries: The Benefits and Costs for Individuals and Health Systems\\", OECD Health Working Papers, No. 15, OECD Publishing, Paris, https://doi.org/10.1787/527211067757.  Equality in Spanish Healthcare  Due to universal health care coverage, inequality is reduced substantially. Inequality in Spain is even further reduced in that co-payments do not usually apply, limited to special medicines and services that are not covered by the National Health System. Therefore, an individual's financial status does not typically determine access to general healthcare.Palència, Laia, et al. “Trends in Social Class Inequalities in the Use of Health Care Services within the Spanish National Health System, 1993–2006.” The European Journal of Health Economics, vol. 14, no. 2, 2013, pp. 211–219. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/23357791. Accessed 11 June 2020. Some inequality does arise in those areas that the NHS does not cover, such as dental care.Garrido- Cumbrera, Marco, et al. “SOCIAL CLASS INEQUALITIES IN THE UTILIZATION OF HEALTH CARE AND PREVENTIVE SERVICES IN SPAIN, A COUNTRY WITH A NATIONAL HEALTH SYSTEM.” International Journal of Health Services, vol. 40, no. 3, 2010, pp. 525–542. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/45131351. Accessed 11 June 2020. On the other hand, people in a disadvantaged social class will typically rely more on the public system for primary health care than those of higher social status. Around 10% of the Spanish population uses private health insurance, generally implying higher socio-economic status, which facilitates access to primary health care. While health care services are universal and continue to see an increase in use within Spain, there are still issues among those with disadvantaged backgrounds.  Immigrants in Spain's Healthcare System  Immigration was seen as one of the most problematic issues for Spain in 2006 by their population.Antón, José-Ignacio, and Rafael Muñoz De Bustillo. “Health Care Utilisation and Immigration in Spain.” The European Journal of Health Economics, vol. 11, no. 5, 2010, pp. 487–498. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/40963270. Accessed 11 June 2020. Migrants are entitled to full public health care benefits, regardless of their legal status. This is due to the goals set by Minister Ernest Lluch in the General Health Law of 1986, which was based on universality of health care. Soon following through many reforms, the Public Health Law of 2011 was enacted, giving all people in Spain the right to free health care regardless of their legal status. While this was overturned through royal decree in 2012, making legality a necessary factor for healthcare, the law was once again reestablished in 2018 after the resignation of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, providing all people in Spain universal access to healthcare. Regarding the use of health care services, there are multiple studies conducted to show the differences between immigrants and nationals. In 2006, studies showed that immigrants had seen a larger number of visits towards emergency rooms when compared to visits from nationals. Conversely, immigrants had shown a lower frequency of visits to general practitioners, fewer days in hospitals, and visits to specialists had seen a lower amount than those reported by Spaniards. In more recent years, a 2016 study shows that global use of healthcare in Spain was utilized more by nationals than by immigrants in all areas. Along with this, the costs for annual prescription drugs showed a much lower price for immigrants when compared to the prices that are given to nationals.Gimeno-Feliu, Luis A et al. “Global healthcare use by immigrants in Spain according to morbidity burden, area of origin, and length of stay.” BMC public health vol. 16 450. 27 May. 2016, doi:10.1186/s12889-016-3127-5 The costs for healthcare in Spain are typically higher for those natives than they are for foreign born immigrants, the mean price being nearly 6.8 times higher. These differences, as referenced in the research study, could be explained in part due to migrants being younger and in healthier conditions, or potentially through possible inequalities among Spanish healthcare providers. When compared to other European countries, most immigrants typically see more physician, general practitioners, and hospital stays than nationals. In a similar fashion, the health of immigrants in other countries are typically in worse shape when compared to natives, Spain being an exception where native-born are considered to be less healthy when compared to their immigrants. Along with this, more individual immigrants in Spain typically have full coverage for costs than is seen by nationals.Solé-Auró, Aïda, et al. “Health Care Usage among Immigrants and Native-Born Elderly Populations in Eleven European Countries: Results from SHARE.” The European Journal of Health Economics, vol. 13, no. 6, 2012, pp. 741–754.

For a general article on health in Italy, see health in Italy Healthcare spending in Italy accounted for 9.2% of GDP in 2012 (about $3,200 per capita), slightly lower than the average of 9.3% in OECD countries. About 77% of the spending is public. In 2000, Italy's healthcare system was regarded, by World Health Organization's ranking, as the 2nd best in the world after France, and according to the World Health Organization, Italy has the world's 6th highest life expectancy.https://www.who.int/gho/mortality_burden_disease/life_tables/situation_trends/en/ The life expectancy at birth in Italy was 82.3 years in 2012, which is over two years above the OECD average. History After World War II, Italy (re-) established its social security system including a social health insurance administered by sickness funds and private insurances. In the 1970s the social health insurance faced severe equity problems as coverage differed between the sickness funds, around 7% of the population remained uninsured, especially in the South. Moreover, sickness funds went practically bankrupt by the mid-1970s. Due to growing public dissatisfaction with the existing healthcare system, Italian policymakers led by the Center-right party Christian- Democrats, instituted structural reform. In 1978, the government established the SSN (Servizio Sanitario Nazionale) — or National Health Service — including universal coverage for all population financed through tax funding, while private health continued to exist but was reserved for those who were willing to pay for extra services or services not offered by the NHS, such as dentistry or psychology Frisina Doetter, Lorraine and Götze, Ralf (2011) \\"The Changing Role of the State in the Italian Healthcare System\\", TranState Working Papers No. 150 National Health Service An Italian National Health Service card. The National Health Service was created in 1978. Healthcare is provided to all citizens and residents by a mixed public-private system. The public part is the national health service, Servizio Sanitario Nazionale (SSN), which is organized under the Ministry of Health and is administered on a regional basis. Family doctors are entirely paid by the SSN, must offer visiting time at least five days a week and have a limit of 1500 patients. Patients can choose and change their GP, subjected to availability. Prescription drugs can be acquired only if prescribed by a doctor. If prescribed by the family doctor, they are generally subsidized, requiring only a copay that depends on the medicine type and on the patient income (in many regions all the prescribed drugs are free for the poor). Over-the-counter drugs are paid out-of-pocket. Both prescription and over-the-counter drugs can only be sold in specialized shops (farmacia). In a sample of 13 developed countries, Italy was sixth in its population weighted usage of medication in 14 classes in 2009 and fifth in 2013. The drugs studied were selected on the basis that the conditions treated had a high incidence, prevalence and/or mortality, caused significant long-term morbidity and incurred high levels of expenditure and significant developments in prevention or treatment had been made in the last 10 years. The study noted considerable difficulties in cross- border comparison of medication use. Visits by specialist doctors or diagnostic tests are provided by the public hospitals or by private ones with contracts to provide services through the national health service, and if prescribed by the family doctor require only a copay (of the order of $40 for a visit without any diagnostic test) and are free for the poor. Waiting times are usually up to a few months in the big public facilities and up to a few weeks in the small private facilities with contracts to provide services through the national health service, though the referring doctor can shorten the waiting times of the more urgent cases by prioritising them. Total health spending as a percentage of GDP in Italy compared with other developed nations in the period 2005-2008. Performance Surgeries and hospitalization provided by public hospitals or by conventioned private ones are completely free of charge for everyone, regardless of their income. For planned surgery waiting times can be up to many months, especially in the big cities. The Italian National Outcomes Programme permits measurement of variation in the quality and outcomes of care by region, which is very considerable. So, for example, the proportion of patients receiving coronary angioplasty within 48 hours of a heart attack varies from about 15% in some regions, such as Marche, Molise and Basilicata to nearly 50% in the northern regions Valle d’Aosta and Liguria. Measured at Local Health Authority level the levels varied between 5% and more than 60%. This geographic variability was the greatest of any of the 11 countries studied by the OECD. There is evidence of patient movement, generally from south to north, probably driven, at least in part, by a search for better quality. Emergency medicine The emergency medical services in Italy currently consist primarily of a combination of volunteers and private companies providing ambulance service, supplemented by physicians and nurses who perform all Advanced Life Support procedures. The primary emergency telephone number for emergency medical service in Italy is still 118, since the European emergency number (112) doesn't work in many regions yet. Emergency medical service is always free of charge. First aid is provided by all the public hospitals: for urgent cases it is completely free of charge for everyone (even for the undocumented), while a copay (about $35) is sometimes asked for non-urgent cases.

Located along Interstate 10 (Katy Freeway) between Beltway 8 and Bunker Hill Road, the district is anchored by Memorial City Mall, the nation's 38th-largest shopping mall; Memorial Hermann Memorial City Medical Center; CityCentre, a high-density mixed-use development; and Town & Country Village, a shopping center. Large portions of Memorial City are owned by development firm MetroNational, which has developed in the area, including the entirety of the mall. Memorial City is a significant regional employment center with over of retail and of office space. The district's businesses employ over 47,000 people. Memorial City Mall attracts approximately 20 million visitors per year. The district's growing residential population houses over 4,400 people, largely concentrated in a series of high-density apartment complexes. A portion of Memorial City is serviced by the Memorial City Management District, a special governmental district which provides branding and infrastructure funding. The management district was created by the Texas Legislature in 1999. History Memorial City Mall—then known as Memorial City Shopping Center—was opened in August 1966 with 42 stores, including the 1,400-seat Memorial Theatre. The mall's opening catalyzed development in its immediate vicinity, with the construction of new apartments and the first portions of the neighborhing hospital complex through the late 1960s. By the early 1970s, the Memorial area was one of the fastest-growing regions in Houston, with the Spring Branch Independent School District adding roughly 4,000 new students per year. Accompanying the rapid growth of the area, Memorial City Mall underwent dramatic changes in the 1970s. In August 1973, a third major anchor store, Montgomery Ward, joined the original two (Sears and Weingarten's). The following year, the mall nearly doubled in size with the addition of a new eastern wing, adding 40 stores including a Foley's, its third major department store. By the mid-1970s, Memorial City Mall boasted over of retail space hosting 126 merchants and 6,500 parking spaces. A fourth expansion was completed in 1977. The area's rapid growth generated enough demand for a second major shopping center, and in February 1983, Town & Country Mall opened at the southeastern corner of Interstate 10 and Beltway 8 with 90 stores. Town & Country quickly grew to 150 stores by 1985, with four lead tenants: Neiman Marcus, Marshall Field's, Joske's, and J. C. Penney. Shortly after its successful debut, a reconstruction project along Interstate 10 commenced, followed by the construction of the Sam Houston Tollway adjacent to the property. By 1986, long-term closures on Interstate 10 depressed visitor numbers so severely that 39 tenants shuttered and retail sales reached an all-time low. Town & Country's developers threatened to sue state and local highway officials, but in 1988, an agreement was reached to adjust the construction schedule. Compounding the mall's struggle to attract shoppers was the onset of the 1980s oil glut, which resulted in a severe local recession in Houston. Memorial City Plaza, a , three-building office complex immediately south of Memorial City Mall, was developed in the early 1980s at a cost of $66 million ($ million in 2017 dollars). In 1988, Loews Cineplex Entertainment announced it would open a new eight-screen theater at Memorial City Mall after the closure of Memorial Theatre earlier in the decade. The addition of the new movie theater and other entertainment options, such as a roller-skating rink and an arcade, helped Memorial City weather the early 1990s recession. The Memorial City Loews would shutter in 2001, following the company's bankruptcy filing in February; Loews claimed the theater was \\"underperforming\\". Town & Country Mall continued to decline through the 1990s, despite the completion of the Beltway 8 project. The new stack interchange at the intersection of Beltway 8 and Interstate 10 obscured the development, which did not have direct access to the Katy Freeway frontage roads. The tollway was described by the Houston Chronicle as a \\"big concrete moat\\" blocking access to the property. In 1995, the mall's developers, JMB Realty, defaulted on the development's $33 million mortgage, which was subsequently purchased by American General. By this point, large portions of the mall—including the entirety of the third floor—were vacant. The Texas Legislature created the Memorial City Management District in 1999.\\"About the District.\\" Memorial City District. Retrieved on January 25, 2009. That same year, the city of Houston proposed the creation of a new Tax Increment Reinvestment Zone (TIRZ) for Memorial City. TIRZs levy incremental taxes on commercial properties to fund new infrastructure within their boundaries. The Memorial City TIRZ, which was proposed to fund new roadway infrastructure and potential office and residential development around the mall, faced strong backlash from Memorial- area residents who expressed skepticism of developer MetroNational's intentions and fear of the traffic congestion new development would bring to the area. A June 1999 area mobility plan accompanying the TIRZ proposal included controversial suggestions to extend roads through existing park space. Ultimately, with the support of mayor Lee P. Brown, the TIRZ was approved by Houston City Council in July 1999 despite a visible and contentious campaign by over 1,200 area residents. City councilmembers, justifying their support of the tax district, expressed their concern about flooding and economic decline in Memorial City. In 1999, a proposed redevelopment of the mall by management firm Taubman Centers—which would have introduced high-end retailers Nordstrom, Lord & Taylor, and Neiman Marcus—was scrapped, with Taubman Centers exiting out of a 55-year management deal it had brokered with MetroNational in 1996. MetroNational devised its own redevelopment plan for the property, beginning with the construction of a new Foley's in 2000. The $100 million redevelopment project, which renovated the entirety of the mall, was completed in 2003, expanding the mall to —the second-largest in Houston, behind The Galleria—and adding retailers Target and Dillard's. A 16-screen Cinemark movie theater opened in 2007, ending the mall's six-year run without a movie theater. After the renovations, retail rents at Memorial City doubled from $200 per square foot to over $400. Meanwhile, Town & Country's malaise continued into the early 2000s as American General attempted to sell the property. The mall lost most of its major tenants with the departure of Saks Fifth Avenue in 2000 and Dillard's in 2002. Town & Country's demise was in spite of an otherwise strong retail environment in west Houston at the time, with the full-scale renovation of Memorial City to the east and the reconstruction of high-end Town and Country Village to the south. In 2004, the property was sold to developer Midway Companies, which immediately announced Town & Country's demolition. In 2007, Midway announced a new $500 million mixed-use development on the site, CityCentre, which was designed to reduce automobile dependency by combining high-density office, retail, and residential components in a pedestrian-oriented urban space. The first phase of the CityCentre project was completed in 2009. In 2014, Midway announced CityCentre's second phase, featuring of office space in two 16-story office towers and a 13-story apartment building on of land fronting Interstate 10. In contrast to Town & Country Mall, CityCentre has been successful, reaching 90% retail occupancy in 2015.,A five-story obelisk installed along Interstate 10 in 2009Following the expansion of Memorial City Mall, MetroNational began developing large tracts of land along Interstate 10 in the late 2000s and early 2010s. To the west, Memorial Hermann expanded with the addition of a 33-story office tower, architecturally notable for its \\"futuristic crown,\\" a Westin hotel, new professional buildings, and a retail center dubbed \\"The Gateway\\". To the east, a large tract between the mall and Bunker Hill Road was gradually filled with high-rise office, hotel, and residential developments, including the U.S. headquarters of Air Liquide. In 2017, Memorial City expanded north of Interstate 10 for the first time with the construction of the U.S. headquarters of Cemex.

His rule was characterized by a period of power struggle, not only of the Serbian throne between the brothers, but between the Byzantine Empire and Kingdom of Hungary, of which he took advantage. He had two brothers Desa and Beloš, and a sister Helena of Serbia, Queen of Hungary. Background Grand Prince Vukan I (r. 1083–1112) initially ruled Rascia under the overlordship of Constantine Bodin, the titular King of Doclea. Bodin renounced the Byzantine Empire in 1089, when he turned to the Pope, who raised the bishopric of Bar to an Archbishopric. In 1089 or by 1091, the Byzantines invaded Doclea, capturing Bodin. Civil war ensued in Doclea, and Rascia asserted independence. Vukan immediately raids Byzantine territory, first in Kosovo, then northern Macedonia. As the Emperor had affairs in other parts of the Empire (Levounion, Crusade), Vukan accepts and then breaks the peace treaties signed between the two, back and forth, until 1106 when the final treaty is signed. In Doclea, Bodin dies before 1101, and his heirs are forced to recognize Byzantine overlordship. Life Uroš II was the son of Uroš I, Grand Prince of Serbia (r. ca. 1112–1145) and Anna Diogenissa, granddaughter of Byzantine Emperor Romanos IV Diogenes. He had two brothers: Desa and Beloš, and a sister: Helena, who married Bela II of Hungary. In 1141, Bela II died and was succeeded by his son Geza II who was still a child.Fine, Early, p. 236 Helena and Beloš (who joined Helena in Hungary after the marriage, and received the title of dux), became the official regents of Hungary until September 1146. In 1145, Beloš receives the title of comes palatinus, the highest court title - meaning he could substitute for the King when necessary. Beloš had close ties with Uroš II, and they were able to count on each other in times of trouble. In 1149, Beloš' Hungarian army aids Uroš II against the Byzantines. Desa is mentioned in a charter dated 1150 as \\"Dessa Dioclie, Terbunie et Zacholmie dux\\", i.e. the Duke of Duklja, Travunija and Zahumlje.Monumenta Historiam Slavorum Meridionalium, Vol. XXIII, Actæ Bosnæ, IX, p. 2. In 1150, Uroš II swore loyalty to the Emperor, and demanded that Desa be put in prison.Stephenson, p. 245 He recovered his title and lands, and Desa also swore loyalty, and was recognized as ruler of the Dalmatian lands. The two brothers were to rule the appointed regions as Manuel's vassals. The event is part of what would become a competition between the Byzantine Emperor and Holy Roman Emperor that would soon move into Hungary. In 1151, Manuel I declares war on Hungary.Fine, Early, p. 238 This was due to the fact that Hungary had aided Serbia in its revolts against Byzantine rule.Cinnamus, p. 90 Byzantine troops are sent into Srem and across the Danube. The Byzantines caused great destruction and then withdrew, the operation being strictly punitive, with no occupation of lands. Geza soon signed a peace treaty. Over the next 20 years, there were to be 10 campaigns against Hungary. Manuel I was able to keep the Hungarians under control in the Balkans, at the expense of abandoning the Norman conflict. In 1153 or 1155, Desa ousts him. The pro- Hungarian faction at the Serbian court was upset with the Byzantine overlordship. In autumn 1154, Manuel I settles the dispute between Uroš II and Desa. The Emperor restored Uroš II in 1155 or 1156, and gave the deposed Desa an appanage of Dendra near Niš.Fine, Late, p. 3 In 1161/1162, Uroš II is replaced by Beloš, who rules briefly, before returning to his office in Hungary and Croatia.Fine, Early, p. 239 Aftermath Zavida had presumably tried to oust either Uroš II or Desa, or acquire an appanage of his own, then fled after failing in his attempt.

It was the largest open-air landfill in Central America, covering 7 km2 in the north-western corner of Managua. It is now covered and sealed, it is a modern waste dispose system which is located on the south shore of Lake Managua and it is near Acahualinca, home to the famous ancient footprints of Acahualinca. Out of the approximately 1,000 persons who reside at the dump, 50% are children under age 18. These children and families work at La Chureca sorting through the waste. Approximately 400 to 440 families live in La Chureca. History It is difficult to say when La Chureca was created as there is no exact date recorded. Most remember it growing significantly after a devastating earthquake hit Managua on December 23, 1972 (Bergin, 2008). According to Science News (1972), the Managuan earthquake devastated approximately 70% of the city, left thousands dead and many others injured. In addition, tens of thousands were left unemployed and this led to a large a rise in extreme poverty. The combination of unemployment and extreme poverty led many families to scavenge for metals and building materials left in the rubble of the earthquake (Bergin, 2008). The majority of these materials ended up in La Chureca, prompting its rapid growth (ibid). In order to feed themselves, people from all over Managua who had no other alternatives went to La Chureca in the morning and worked long days, looking for salvageable materials for their own use or to sell (ibid). Though some people returned home after their long days at work, other who were left homeless after the earthquake constructed their houses out of the rubble itself and stayed in La Chureca. La Chureca has continuously grown since the 1970s. Characteristics La Chureca is a slang term for the city trash dump in Managua, Nicaragua, referring to a community of people who live and work there, \\"sifting\\" or \\"filtering\\" through the garbage daily (Athanasiadou & Cuadra, &Marsh;, & Bergman, Jakobsson;2008). La Chureca is the municipal domestic and industrial waste disposal site in Managua, the capital of Nicaragua. Managua, which is in the south western part of Nicaragua, is situated at the shore of Lake Managua. Lake Managua is the second largest lake in Nicaragua and is used as the recipient of domestic and industrial wastewater from the city (Cuadra & Linderholm & Athanasiadou & Jakobsson, 2006). La Chureca is located on the south shore of Lake Managua and covers an area of 7 km2. It is beside the museum that contains the famous 6,000-year-old Acahualinca footprints, the oldest remaining human and animal footprints on the American continent. La Chureca is the largest open air dumpster in Central America. It is surrounded by high brick walls, covering 42 hectares of Managua with vultures soaring over infinite layers of garbage. Grisby Vergara (2008) describes this area as a war zone and an “enormous breeding ground for flies, microbes, rotting food, burnt trash, hundreds of plastic bags..”. There is always a thick cloud of smoke that covers the area, increasing with the heat of the day. This thick cloud of smoke is a result of the fires that are set by the Mayor and municipal government office to keep the garbage from piling up and retrieve iron and other materials (Cuadra, &Linderholm;, & Athanasiadou, & Jakobsson, 2006). In addition, there is constant stench in the air of shoe glue, lead, and excrement (Grisby Vergara, 2008). Managua's population has considerably expanded since 1995 (Bergin, 2008). Consequently, garbage production has also increased. Managua produces over 1,200 tons of garbage daily (Grisby Vergara, 2008). There are big trucks full of garbage that arrive in La Chureca every day at all hours of the day. There are approximately 3000 individuals who make their living working in La Chureca (Grisby Vergara, 2008). Of these, approximately 115–180 families live within La Chureca. The individuals who work and live in La Chureca are named ‘churequeros’ and they are some of the poorest people of the country. Of these, more than 50% are children under the age of 18 (Cuadra, &Linderholm;, & Athanasiadou, & Jakobsson, 2006). Children are most often involved in more than one activity, most frequently: handling glass, metals, and plastics (ibid). Working in La Chureca is considered one of the worst forms of child labour in Nicaragua (ibid). Some of the most common activities of La Chureca workers of all ages include: recollection, classification, selling, storing, and cleaning of recyclable waste (Cuadra, &Linderholm;, &Athanasiadou;, & Jakobsson; 2006). Over the years, ‘churequeros’ have figured out ways of organizing the trash and making small profits off salvageable and recyclable materials (Bergin, 2008). These individuals swarm all around La Chureca with makeshift spears which are used to pick through the garbage which is then sorted and sold to suppliers of recyclable materials. Workers in La Chureca are self- employed individuals and, or families who collect salvageable items such as plastic, aluminum cans, and scrap metals such as copper and iron (Bergin, 2008). These workers are highly organized labour chains. That is, if one person collects glass, the other will clean it, another will crush and recycle it and another will sell it to a collector who will then sell it to different companies (Grisby Vergara, 2008). It is clear that the existing piles of garbage would be much larger if it were not for the individuals that work there (Grisby Vergara, 2008). La Chureca produces approximately US$20 million a year in marketable garbage and Churequeros earn between US$1.50 and US$2 a day (Bergin, 2008). Materials are often sold by the pound. For example, eleven pounds of aluminum equates to roughly twelve córdoba profits (US$0.63) for garbage sorters (Bergin, 2008). Living and working in La Chureca brings terrible health hazards to churequeros. Often, families need to scavenge food from the waste as they lack the means necessary to purchase food. The food that is scavenged is mostly from restaurants dumping including: meat, dairy products, vegetable, and fruits (Bergin, 2008). The consumption of this rotting food frequently leads to intestinal and digestive problems for Churequeros (ibid). Because there used to be a slaughterhouse across the lagoon which merges with La Chureca, remains of farm animals such as bones, cow heads, and blood; pollute the land, water, and air in and surrounding La Chureca. In addition, much of the garbage from La Chureca often spills over into Lake Managua, affecting its natural resources. Fish from Lake Managua are an important part of the diet of the population living in poverty at lakeshore yet, there have been high levels of mercury found in native fish species in Lake Managua (Cuadra, &Linderholm;, & Athanasiadou, & Jakobsson, 2006; Mc Crary, Castro, McKaye, 2005). Planned demolition and status There are a number of international organizations and NGOs that have been working in La Chureca for a number of years. Many of these organizations have succeeded in building community centers, community libraries, and schools. Some of these NGOs include: ProNica-Quakers in Solidarity with Nicaraguans, Los Quinchos, Project Chacocente, Colegio Cristiano La Esperanza, Mision Cristiana Corazones Abierto, Austin Samaritans and Manna Project International (MPI) work with a local NGO FUNJOFUDESS and sponsor the only health clinic in La Chureca - Casa Base de Salud, Children's Smile and Hope Association, NICA, Catholic Youth Advocates, Inc. and HOPE. In August 2007, radical change got underway in La Chureca due to a visit by María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, the Vice President of Spain’s government, during an official visit to Nicaragua. A few months after the Vice President’s visit, the AECID (the Spanish Agency of International Development Collaborations), revealed a 30 million Euro integral development project for La Chureca.Clean Start for Nicaragua Dump - Americas - Al Jazeera English This is a three part project which includes: firstly, closing down the existing dumpster; secondly, creating a new alternative recycling industry for the waste; and thirdly, housing and social integration alternatives for those living or working in or around La Chureca. The idea of the project is to bring dignity to people (Grisby Vergara, 2008). This project is seen as a threat to many of the people working in La Chureca because many of them are scared of being left without any means of livelihood (Hartmann, 2010; Hartmann, 2012).

He was not without significance for his country. Important government decisions characterize him, but much more important is his more general political activity, making him one of the most striking princes of the House of Nassau.Sauer (1889). He took part in the Third Crusade. Biography Nassau Castle The coat-of-arms of the counts of Nassau Rupert was probably a son of count Arnold II of Laurenburg and a woman of unknown name.Cawley. Rupert is mentioned as count of Nassau between 1160 and 1190. He ruled together with his cousin Henry I and later with his cousin Walram I. Rupert was one of the trusted councilors of Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa, in whose surroundings we usually find him. In 1161 and 1162 he was with the emperor at Milan; whether he participated in the further trips to Italy in the years 1166 and 1167 remains questionable; likewise, participation in the unfortunate journey of 1174-1176 is, although likely, not traceable. It is also believed that he was present at the Diet of Pentecost at Mainz. In 1172 Rupert became Vogt of Schönau Abbey. Since 1182 he was Vogt of Koblenz. He is called Ruoberdus comes in the inscription of a coin, dated around 1175.\\"Unser Krönchen - Band 1\\", Verlag Vorländer, 1983, p. 15. With his cousin Walram, Rupert joined the Third Crusade (1189-1190), and in 1190 commanded the fourth army troop.Lück (1981), p. 18. He was assigned an important task at the start of the journey. Together with his cousin Walram and Count Henry of Diez, he formed the accompaniment of Bishop Herman II of Münster, who was envoy to Byzantine Emperor Isaac II Angelos in the fall of 1188. The delegation did arrive in Constantinople, but was treated badly by the Byzantine Emperor and imprisoned in poor conditions.Sauer (1896).Setton, at al. (2005), p. 896. They were set free as the crusade army approached.Vorsterman van Oyen (1882). On October 28, 1189, Rupert and his companions rejoined the crusade army at Philippopel. Nothing is known with certainty about his further participation in the crusade; it seems that he stayed until the end of the siege of Akko and then died on the way back at sea.Gislebert of Mons. (1869). Chronicon Hanoniense, hrsg. von Wilhelm Arndt in: Monumenta Germaniae Historica SS 21, p. 579. He was succeeded by his son Herman. Marriage and children Rupert married in or before 1169 to Elizabeth of Leiningen († 20 June 1235/38), daughter of Emicho III, Count of Leiningen. As widow she used the title countess of Schowenburg. From this union came two children: # Herman († 16 July before 1206), count of Nassau 1190–1192. # Lucardis († before 1222), she first married around 1200 to Gebhard IV of Querfurt, viscount of Magdeburg († Querfurt 1213)Cawley mentions that there is doubt about the first marriage of Lucardis to Gebhard of Querfurt. and remarried in 1214 to Herman V, Count of Virneburg († after 1254).

The party is part of the Frente de Todos coalition that supported the presidential candidate Alberto Fernández during the 2019 Argentine general election. History=Beginnings as PC(CNRR)= The party emerged from a split in the Communist Party of Argentina in 1967.Partido Comunista Revolucionario de la Argentina. Fundado el 6 de enero de 1968 – Partido Comunista Revolucionario de la Argentina On January 6, 1968 (the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party) the dissidents formed the Communist Party – National Revolutionary Recovery Committee (, abbreviated PC(CNRR)). The founders of PC(CNRR) came mainly from the Communist Youth Federation (FJC), although the group also included some Communist Party cadres. Leaders of PC(CNRR) included Jorge Rocha, Carlos Echagüe, Lucila Irene Edelman, Ricardo Helman, José Ratzer, Antonio Sofía and Otto C. Vargas (veteran leader of FJC and erstwhile secretary of La Plata Zone Committee of the Communist Party). PC(CNRR) published Nueva Hora. PC(CNRR) rejected the Communist Party line of building a broad democratic front, accusing the Communist Party of 'conciliation with imperialism' and 'class conciliation'. In contrast to the democratic front line of the old party, PC(CNRR) called for the building of a national liberation front. PC(CNRR) sought to work within the Communist Party, to gain followers amongst its ranks. PC(CNRR) was active inside the Argentine University Federation (FUA). In late 1967 the Communist Party dissidents (that soon would form PC(CNRR)) set up the Textile Organizational and Struggle Command (COLT) as its front group amongst textile workers.Política Obrera. La crisis del COLT y el CNRR On January 10, 1969 the name PCR was adopted, marking a definite break with the old Communist Party. =Development towards Maoism= Initially PC(CNRR)/PCR had a 'guevarist' orientation. The party turned towards Maoism following a visit to China by a PCR delegation in 1972. The development of a Maoist identity of party led to a split, in which the adherents of immediate armed struggle were expelled from the party. =Involvement in automobile industry unions= PCR sought to organize workers in the automobile industry, by distribution of pamphlets at factory gates and sending some of its cadres to take up employment at factories. In the wake of the 1969 Cordobazo, the PCR identified the Perdiel plant as a priority for union organizing. Soon the PCR-dominated left opposition began gaining influence at the plant. On May 12, 1970 PCR activists took a group of French supervisors hostage at the Perdriel plant of IKA- Renault. This action was done in protest against the removal of leftist candidates in the local union election. The factory management caved in and reinstated the leftist candidates. The May 12, 1970 factory occupation marked the start of more militant industrial struggles in Argentina. In late 1971, ahead of the 1972 Union of Automotor Transport Mechanics and Similar Trades (Smata) union election in Córdoba, PCR and other left groups (Communist Party, Communist Vanguard, Palabra Obrera, El Obrero, Peronismo de Base and non- affiliated leftists) launched the Trade Union Recovery Movement (MRS). On April 30, 1972 PCR won various leadership posts in the Union of Automotor Transport Mechanics and Similar Trades (Smata) union election in Córdoba. The MRS brown list defeated the Peronist green list. René Salamca, a Central Committee member of the party, was elected general secretary of SMATA-Córdoba, accompanied by Roque Romero as assistant secretary. =FRA and the 1975 crisis= Ahead of the March 1973 general election, the PCR formed the Fuerza Revolucionaria Antiacuerdista (FRA, \\"Revolutionary Anti-Accord Force\\") together with Communist Vanguard and independent left groups. In 1975, the PCR called for support to Isabel Perón's government. =After the return of democracy (since 1983)= PCR set up the Party of Labour and of the People (PTP) as a separate entity to build a broader, legal base. PTP contested the 1987 legislative election. In the 1989 general election PTP supported the candidature of Carlos Menem for president and his Frejupo alliance. Clelia Íscaro of PTP (i.e. PCR) stood as a parliamentary candidate for Frejupo. PTP contested the 1993 legislative election. Following the struggles after the events in Santiago del Estero in 1993, the PCR developed a line of electoral abstention (calling for blank vote) and call for insurrection. The PCR today=Involvement in the Piquetero movement= PCR graffiti: \\"In the path of the Argentinazo!\\"Within the onset of the 1998–2002 Argentine great depression, the party assigned Juan Carlos Alderete to build a section for unemployed within the Corriente Clasista y Combativa (CCC, the PCR trade union front organization). Thus the CCC became the key element of the activity of PCR in the piquetero movement CCC formed a tactical alliance with the CTA- linked piquetero group FTV, and the FTV-CCC alliance emerged as the dominant bloc in the piquetero movement 2000–2003. The FTV-CCC bloc carried out several mass protests in the Buenos Aires urban area against the social and economic policies of the government. In 2003 the alliance between FTV and CCC broke apart over differences on how to relate to the Nestor Kirchner administration, as FTV favoured cooperation with the new government whilst CCC rejected it. =Rural movements= PCR maintains networks within agrarian movements such as Movimiento Mujeres en Lucha (MML), Juventud Agraria and Federación Agraria Argentina (FAA). Outreach PCR publishes Hoy as its main organ., and counts with a youth wing of the party called Revolutionary Communist Youth (Juventud Comunista Revolucionaria, JCR). JCR publishes the monthly La Chispa.

Antiphilosophy and Wittgenstein's metaphilosophy In The New York Times, Paul Horwich points to Wittgenstein's rejection of philosophy as traditionally and currently practiced and his \\"insistence that it can't give us the kind of knowledge generally regarded as its raison d'être\\". Horwich goes on to argue that: Horwich concludes that, according to Wittgenstein, philosophy \\"must avoid theory-construction and instead be merely 'therapeutic,' confined to exposing the irrational assumptions on which theory-oriented investigations are based and the irrational conclusions to which they lead\\". Moreover, these antiphilosophical views are central to Wittgenstein, Horwich argues. Examples of antiphilosophical positions=Ethics= The antiphilosopher could argue that, with regard to ethics, there is only practical, ordinary reasoning. Therefore, it is wrong to a priori superimpose overarching ideas of what is good for philosophical reasons. For example, it is wrong to blanketly assume that only happiness matters, as in utilitarianism. This is not to say though that some utilitarian-like argument can't be valid when it comes to what is right in some particular case. =Continuum hypothesis= Consider the continuum hypothesis, stating that there is no set with size strictly between the size of the natural numbers and the size of the real numbers. One idea is that the set universe ought to be rich, with many sets, which leads to the continuum hypothesis being false.Continuum hypothesis#Arguments for and against CHPenelope Maddy, June 1988, \\"Believing the Axioms, I\\", Journal of Symbolic Logic 53 (2): 481–511, http://www.socsci.uci.edu/~pjmaddy/bio/Believing%20the%20Axioms%20(with%20corrections).pdf This richness argument, the antiphilosopher might argue, is purely philosophical, and groundless, and therefore should be dismissed; maintaining that the continuum hypothesis should be settled by mathematical arguments. In particular it could be the case that the question isn't mathematically meaningful or useful, that the hypothesis is neither true, nor false. It is then wrong to stipulate, a priori and for philosophical reasons, that the continuum hypothesis is true or false.

Taxonomy It is one of two species within the genus Heteromyias. Previously, it and the grey-headed robin from Australia were treated as one species and known as Heteromyias albispecularis. It has also been classified within the genus Poecilodryas. Described by Italian naturalist, Tommaso Salvadori, in 1874, the ashy robin is a member of the Australasian robin family Petroicidae. Sibley and Ahlquist's DNA-DNA hybridisation studies placed this group in a Corvida parvorder comprising many tropical and Australian passerines, including pardalotes, fairy-wrens, honeyeaters, and crows. However, subsequent molecular research (and current consensus) places the robins as a very early offshoot of the Passerida (or \\"advanced\\" songbirds), within the songbird lineage. Description Measuring , the ashy robin is a large and solidly built robin. It has a sooty black head and cheeks, with a white stripe extending backwards and upwards from the eyes. It has a white throat darkening to buff underparts and olive-brown upperparts. There is a white patch on the otherwise dark-plumaged wing. The bill is grey-black, the eyes are dark brown, and the legs pale pink. Distribution and habitat The ashy robin is found across the mountain ranges of New Guinea (in both West Papua and Papua New Guinea) from . Within the rainforest it is found singly or occasionally in pairs in the understory or on the ground. Behaviour=Feeding= It is insectivorous, and hunts by gleaning or snatching, often on the ground. Among its prey are ants, beetles, phasmids, centipedes, and earthworms. =Breeding= The nest is a shallow cup made of bark, grass, twigs, and dry leaves. Spider webs are used for binding or filling. The nest is generally placed in cover above the ground. The clutch consists of a single cream- or olive-white egg, marked with light brown or mauve splotches and spots, usually concentrated around the large end. The egg measures 24 by 20 mm in size.

History  This station was built to connect to the New York & Putnam Railroad passenger trains that terminated there instead of the former 155th Street terminal and New York Central Railroad Hudson Division trains that stopped at the new (1918) platforms at this location. This station opened on July 1, 1918, and remained in use by the Polo Grounds Shuttle until 1958. The Putnam Division of the New York Central also ended service in 1958.Polo Grounds Shuttle  Station layout  This station was built extending from the tunnel entrance to Jerome Avenue on the side of a cliff on a steel structure spanning the tracks of Metro-North's Hudson Line that connected to the existing Putnam Bridge, which had been built for the New York City and Northern Railroad. The station street entrance and mezzanine was above the tracks on Sedgwick Avenue. The west end of the platforms on the steel structure were constructed of wood. The east end of the concrete platforms extended into the tunnel for about a car length. A connecting passageway and stairways from the west end of the northbound platform led to the platforms on the New York Central Hudson Division tracks to permit transfers to that division's trains.See New York Central Hudson Division Sedgwick Avenue Station in Forgotten BronxTransit The station site, in 2010, has ruins of the platforms and the track-bed into the tunnel entrance on Sedgwick Avenue. The tunnel from Sedgwick Avenue to Anderson–Jerome Avenues was built to NYC Elevated Railway standards. Those standards specified the clearance between the tracks and the sides of the tunnel only allowed for the \\"El\\" type open third rail instead of the covered third rail in use on the IRT Subway. The standard distance from the center of the track to the center of the El type open third rail-head is a few inches shorter than the distance to the subway type covered third rail-head. This incompatibility prevented the line from being used in the future by standard IRT Subway equipment, and brought about the line's demise instead of being linked to the IRT Jerome Avenue Line at 167th Street in The Bronx and the IRT Lenox Avenue Line at Harlem–148th Street in Manhattan, which had been proposed by the New York City Board of Transportation in 1940.

Description The reinforced concrete station structure extended from the end of the tunnel from the Sedgwick Avenue station over Jerome Avenue. The tunnel emerges from the basement of an apartment building on Anderson Avenue. A portion of the island platform is in the tunnel. The station had entrances at each end of the structure on each side of Jerome Avenue and Anderson Avenue. A grate where the main staircase used to go up toward the platform still exists. The entire structure was on a private right-of-way. The tunnel is still intact to this day. The structure east of the station was a two track steel structure north of 162nd Street that curved north to ramp up to the IRT Jerome Avenue Line elevated structure on River Avenue. The ramp was integrated with the Jerome Avenue Line structure and a stub of the curve remains, pointing toward the new Yankee Stadium. North of the curve stub, the lower track structures gradually ramp up to the meet the Jerome Avenue mainline from 164th Street and 166th Street; the ramps structures are located between the outer Jerome Avenue local tracks and inner express track. An IRT electric substation is north of the curve stub. Although the station is no longer accessible, the site is home to many pieces of graffiti. Trash also litters the station and trees are sprouting where the tracks formerly lay. This station used to be accessible, although the route is not intended for use, through the Sedgwick Avenue station. A footbridge connects with an abandoned park, where the tunnel used to be open to urban explorers. Today, however, the entrance is boarded up, and fences are placed with the intention to deter intruders. The building atop which the station sits is still visible at the intersection of East 162nd Street and Jerome Avenue.

The son of John Crewe, 2nd Baron Crewe, an army general, and Henrietta Maria Anna Walker-Hungerford, he was educated at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford. He had two sisters; Henrietta Hungerford Offley Crewe (1808-1879) and Annabella Hungerford Crewe (1814-1874). He was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1840 and of the Royal Society in 1841. Landlord and charitable works On his father's death in 1835, he became the third Baron Crewe and inherited the Jacobean mansion of Crewe Hall in Cheshire, together with a large estate in Cheshire, Staffordshire and Leicestershire. In 1871, he was the fifth greatest landowner in Cheshire, with a total of .Crosby, Alan. A History of Cheshire, p. 87 (Phillimore; 1996) () At his death in 1894, the total rents were estimated at £37,000 per year. He appears to have been a relatively benevolent landlord, rebuilding farms, providing cottages and endowing schools. In 1866, he paid more compensation to tenant farmers whose herds were affected by the cattle plague outbreak than was required by law.Scard, Geoffrey.

Bagley), p. 91 (Cheshire Community Council; 1981) () He also made many charitable gifts, for example in Sandbach where he donated his income as lord of the manor to the local board, gave land for a town and market hall, and erected a drinking fountain. It was a period of rapid change: when he inherited the estate, the area to the west of Crewe Hall park was countryside with scattered farms; by his death it was occupied by the major railway centre of Crewe. He unsuccessfully opposed the construction of a Silverdale and Madeley Railway Company line from Newcastle-under-Lyme to Wrexham, which passed through the Crewe estate.Scard, p. 36 Alterations to Crewe Hall Garden front and lake, from an engraving of c. 1818 Lord Crewe commissioned Edward Blore to make alterations to Crewe Hall (1837–42). These included major changes to the plan of the building, redecoration of the interior in a Jacobethan style more sympathetic to the original Jacobean house, and modernisations including the installation of a warm-air heating system. Blore also added a centrepiece and clocktower to the stables quadrangle and built a gate lodge. The total cost of the works was £30,000.de Figueiredo, Peter & Treuherz, Julian.

Extensive restoration work was carried out for Lord Crewe by E. M. Barry, son of Sir Charles Barry, the architect of the Palace of Westminster (1866–70). Barry added a tower to the west wing; required for water storage, the tower was intended to unite the east and west wings of the hall. He also reorganised the plan of the ground floor.

It was a strut-braced, high-wing monoplane of conventional design with an enclosed cabin and fixed, taildragger undercarriage. One specialized version was produced as a trainer for Pan American Airways. Development Rearwin Aircraft began developing the Cloudster in 1938, while still selling the older Speedster and Sportster. The goal was to develop an aircraft with side-by-side seating, using as much tooling and existing equipment as possible. Widening either the Speedster or Sportster was considered, but by the time the design was completed, the strut geometry, landing gear, fuselage structure, engine installation, and cabin had to be changed. Development of the prototype took 6 months. Originally the plane was dubbed the \\"Rearwin Coupe,\\" a name which changed to \\"Cloudster\\" after a month. The 90hp prototype (Model 8090) was never developed for production, instead the basic Model 8125 used a 120hp Ken-Royce 7F engine also made by Rearwin. In 1940, the Model 8135 added a third, sideways-facing, seat to the Model 8125. Pan American Airways founder Juan Trippe, who personally owned a Rearwin Sportster, approached the company in 1941 to develop an instrument trainer. The existing Model 8135 was redesigned and certified in four months as the 8135T. Pan Am bought 5 of the design, while another 20 went to various operators. Design The Cloudster was a two- or three-seat aircraft of high- wing design and conventional landing gear arrangement. Designed to seat two side-by-side, the Model 8135 introduced a third seat behind the front row which could be accessed by folding the right-hand seat forward. The last model, Model 8135T, sat two in tandem. All versions used Ken-Royce radial engines of 90-120hp, as the engines were produced by a division of the Rearwin Aircraft & Engines Company and the company was experienced building airplanes with small radial engines. Beginning in late 1941, the Cloudster used a NACA cowling hinged along the top for engine access. The interior of the Cloudster (or at least the prototype) used surplus cloth from Cadillac and a simulated woodgrain panel. A baggage compartment held 50lbs. The tandem seating Model 8135T introduced jettisonable doors for both the instructor and student pilot, dual controls, and seats with removable cushions to accommodate backpack or seat parachutes. The student sat in the rear seat with their own controls and a removable instrument panel. The 8135T included fittings for a blackout curtain surrounding the student for instrument training, while allowing the instructor to maintain normal visibility. Operational history In 1941, 25 Model 8125 Cloudsters were exported to the Aero Club of Iran. The aircraft remained in service as of 1945, with a .30 caliber machine gun mounted on the left wing strut outside the propeller arc. From August 1941 to July 1942, 25 Model 8135T trainers were sold to various operators. How long they served is unknown.

There are currently 5,000 Swiss citizens residing in Chile, and between 90,000 and 100,000 descendants.  Immigration  The number of Swiss in Chile is minor, despite having a relatively large number of members. This is because their linguistic and cultural characteristics are commonly confused with Germans, Italians and French. Swiss migration to Chile took place at the end of the 19th century, between 1883 and 1900, particularly in the area of Araucanía, especially in Victoria and Traiguén. It is estimated that more than 8,000 thousand families received grants of land. Los suizos del fin del mundo. Swiss Benevolent Society in Victoria, Araucanía Region.

People migrated mainly to United States in North America, Australia, Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina and Chile. This was an organized exodus and had limited duration. As economic immigration, the State assumed a regulatory role by granting or denying requests for leave. Through official reports of the Swiss Consulate in Valparaíso, highlighting the advantages or disadvantages that Chile offered to migrants in Europe. Only 28 years after the commencement of the German colonization in the southern Chile, the Federal Council in 1881 authorized the specialized agencies to operate in Switzerland to recruit migrants.

These farmers received government land grants consisting of hectares of prime Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub land which they proceeded to transform into agricultural lands suitable for pasture and crop farming.  Mass immigration  The first group of immigrants was composed of 1,311 families who landed in Valparaíso on 19 December 1883.
