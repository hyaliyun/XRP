Early life  Levitas was born in New York City. He attended Horace Mann School and then Dalton School in Manhattan. After graduating from the Dalton School, he attended New York University. He graduated in 2000 with a degree from the Gallatin School of NYU. He is Jewish. Art career In addition to a growing list of American and international gallery exhibitions, Levitas‚Äô work has garnered attention through top auction houses, museums, and art fairs. 2012 highlights include a solo exhibition Metalwork Photograph: Sculptures at Phillips de Pury in Manhattan, as well as a ten-year retrospective Andrew Levitas: A Brief Survey 2002‚Äì2012 at New York University. 2014 highlights include the first solo exhibition ever presented at the highly anticipated Phillips, Berkeley square which included examples of Levitas's earlier two- dimensional artwork in which he successfully fused metalwork and photography, as well as examples of the artist's more recent works depicting crumpled sheets and three-dimensional freestanding installations, all made in his distinctive and innovative style.https://www.myphillipsdepury.com/auctions/lot- detail.aspx?sn=NY040210&search;=&p;=28‚Ñ¥=1&lotnum;=335  Photographic sculpture  In 2004 Levitas produced his \\"Metalwork Experiment.\\" Developed by the artist, Metalwork Photography photographic sculptures are formed by a process involving the transfer of photographs onto custom transparencies that are in turn melted onto hand detailed sheets. Levitas‚Äô installations are each composed of multi-paneled interlocking metal sheets whose collective impact transcends their individual materiality. Other works included in the exhibition are crumpled sheets of metal that resonate with John Chamberlain's mangled installations, inspired by the action Abstract Expressionist paintings that typified the Post-War New York School. However, as opposed to Chamberlain's incorporation of readymades, Levitas's creation and subsequent disfiguration of his own artwork adds a performative twist to his artwork that situates it at the vanguard of contemporary art. The result is a work that combines the imagery of a photograph with the presence of a sculpture. While these works are printed as editions, they function as unique objects since each print differs, depending on the level of hand tooling.  Paintings  Levitas‚Äô \\"organic abstractions\\" (paintings built from home made pigments, canvas, and organic materials ‚Äì in some cases entire trees) have also received critical acclaim. The work, often reflective of Los Angeles life, is in part a commentary on emotion and the way we choose to express ourselves, as well as the ways in which we insulate ourselves from essential truth. The work also stresses a larger discourse on nature, the organic and its place in the contemporary world. Artists Collaborations In 2015, Levitas created the CUBA X LEVITAS as part of an artist collaboration with the skate brand Supra. Film career Levitas is the founder of Metalwork Pictures a media production company which develops, produces, and finances original content. Titles include Minamata (Johnny Depp, Bill Nighy, Hiroyuki Sanada), My Zoe (Julie Delpy, Daniel Br√ºhl, Gemma Arterton, Richard Armitage), Georgetown (Christoph Waltz, Vanessa Redgrave, Annette Bening), The White Crow (Ralph Fiennes), Farming (Kate Beckinsale, Gugu Mbatha-Raw), The Gateway (Bruce Dern, Olivia Munn, Frank Grillo), Last Moment of Clarity (Samara Weaving, Udo Kier, Brian Cox), The Quarry (Michael Shannon, Shea Whigham), Flower (Zoey Deutch), At Any Price (Dennis Quaid, Zac Efron), Affluenza (Nicola Peltz), and The Art of Getting By (Emma Roberts, Freddie Highmore). Currently, Levitas is in post- production on his latest directing project Minamata starring Academy Award nominee Johnny Depp, BAFTA and Golden Globe winner Bill Nighy and Hiroyuki Sanada as Mitsuo Yamazaki, The film follows Smith's 1971 journey to the Japanese fishing village of Minamata to bear witness to the devastation of its townspeople by mercury poisoning caused by the Chisso corporation. Prior to Minamata, Levitas wrote and directed Lullaby which stars Amy Adams, Richard Jenkins, Terrence Howard, Jennifer Hudson, and Garrett Hedlund. The film, an exploration of patients‚Äô rights, was described by Pete Hammond (Deadline) as a ‚Äústrong human drama‚Äù with ‚ÄúJenkins a true actor‚Äôs actor, delivering a very Oscar-worthy supporting turn.‚Äù In 2017 he produced British film The White Crow written by David Hare and directed by Ralph Fiennes. It stars Oleg Ivenko as the ballet dancer Rudolf Nureyev, chronicling his life and dance career. It is inspired by the book Rudolf Nureyev: The Life by Julie Kavanagh. It premiered at the 2018 Telluride Film Festival and the 2018 BFI London Film Festival. The film also screened at the Tokyo International Film Festival, Cinemania (Bulgaria) and Febiofest (Czech Republic). Ralph Fiennes received the Special Achievement Award for Outstanding Artistic Contribution at the Tokyo International Film Festival, with the film receiving a Tokyo Grand Prix nomination. The film was released on March 22, 2019 in the UK (StudioCanal) and on April 26, 2019 in the US (Sony Pictures Classics). The New York Times wrote ‚ÄúThe White Crow is a portrait of the artist as a young man, an attempt to show the complex array of factors ‚Äî biographical, psychological, social, political ‚Äî that led to the moment when the 23-year-old dancer made a decision that would change the history of ballet: Nureyev became Nureyev by defecting from Russia to the West at Le Bourget airport in France in June 1961‚Ä¶ Throughout [the film], Fiennes and Hare suggest the extraordinary will and curiosity that drove Nureyev to dance, and to seek out art and culture wherever he could.‚Äù Levitas brought to life director Adewale Akinnuoye- Agbaje‚Äôs own story in Farming . Screen Daily wrote of the film, ‚ÄúActor turned director Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje makes an arresting feature debut with Farming. Told with raw emotion and lurid violence, it transforms elements of his life story into a disturbing, eye-opening coming of age drama.‚Äù Farming premiered at the 2018 Toronto International Film Festival on 8 September in the Discovery Section. The film won the Michael Powell Award at the 2019 Edinburgh Film Festival. Lionsgate UK released the film in the United Kingdom on 11 October 2019, followed by a United States release on 25 October. In 2018, Levitas produced My Zoe from writer and director Julie Delpy. My Zoe premiered at the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival as part of the Platform Prize program. IndieWire raved that ‚ÄúDelpy‚Äôs ability to believe in both her audience and her wild story remains compelling throughout the film... Delpy earns every minute of the story, one that shows off her ability (and desire) mix things up with a fresh eye.‚Äù Levitas produced 2019 film Georgetown from Christoph Waltz in his feature directorial debut. Georgetown had its world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 27, 2019. The Hollywood Reporter praised the film, noting that \\"it's the kind of serious but broadly appealing, modestly scaled picture that people love to say doesn't exist any more.\\" Academic career Levitas is also a part-time faculty member at New York University, teaching a course on \\"The Artist's Mind.\\" Personal life Since October 2013, Levitas has been in a relationship with Welsh classical- crossover singer Katherine Jenkins.

Early career Billy Taylor played his first professional game in 1980 after being drafted by the Texas Rangers in the second round (39th overall pick) of the 1980 draft. Initially drafted as a starter, in 1981, he went 4‚Äì2 with a 2.72 ERA in Rookie-Level. However, he struggled after a promotion to Single-A, going just 1‚Äì7 with a 4.64 ERA. Over the next two seasons, used as a combination reliever/starter, he went 13‚Äì18 with a 5.54 ERA. He did strike out 212 batters. In 1984, used in 42 games, he re-established his prospect status with a 5‚Äì3 record and a 3.83 ERA in AA. In 1985, he topped 100 innings pitched for the first time in his career, and he also had a 3.47 ERA. He then threw 169 innings between AA and AAA and pitched fairly well with a 4.36 ERA between the two stops. He was only 24 years old. The next season, he pitched poorly, going 12‚Äì9 with a 5.61 ERA. Again, he threw about 170 innings. The next year, Taylor got injured and started only 11 games with an ERA of 5.49. Granted free agency by the Rangers, he signed in 1989 with the Padres, who needed depth in their bullpen. He appeared in 49 games in AAA, with again a high ERA of 5.13. First success By 1990, Taylor's career appeared to be over. He was 28 years old and had pitched poorly in AAA as both a starter and a reliever. However, the Atlanta Braves signed him in the middle of August 1990, seeing that his walk rate in 1989 was the lowest it had been in his minor league career. He appeared in 7 games that season. In 1991, no one could have predicted that he would go 6‚Äì2 in 59 games as a reliever with a 1.51 ERA in AA, morphing into one of the best closers in that league. 1992 was more of the same for Taylor. He went 2‚Äì3 with a 2.28 ERA and 12 saves. In 1993, at the age of 31, he was an All-Star, saved 26 games, struck out more than a batter an inning, and had a 1.98 ERA, all in AAA. He won the league's reliever of the year award as well. Major League career In 1994, a full 14 years after Billy Taylor had been drafted, he finally played in the big leagues. With a 3.50 ERA, he was arguably the most important reliever in the A's bullpen. From 1996‚Äì1999, Taylor saved 99 games. His best season came in 1998, where he had 33 saves (eighth in the AL), and a 3.58 ERA. On July 31, 1999, he was traded by the Oakland Athletics to the New York Mets for Jason Isringhausen and Greg McMichael. He then played for the Mets, Tampa Bay Devil Rays, and Pittsburgh Pirates before retiring from baseball.

Grynberg (born 1932) is a Polish-born American businessman. He is a Denver-based oil and gas developer who has amassed a multibillion-dollar fortune in the oil and natural gas sector. As of 2019, he has been in a long- running litigation to regain control of companies he founded from his ex-wife and three children, or failing that, around $400 million in back pay.  Early life  Born to a Jewish family in Brest, Belarus, then part of Poland, V.Glazov ‚ÄúJack Grynberg. Oil tycoon from Brest-on-Bug, Brestskiy Kurier, October 15, 2014. Grynberg was in the second grade when the Nazis invaded Poland. He has stated that he joined the resistance and by the age of 12 he was fighting in the forests of Belarus, and fought until 1945. He then moved to Colorado, where he attended the Colorado School of Mines, married, and began raising his three children. He also has claimed that he later worked as a spy for the US Army in 1957 and 1958. He has a master's degree in Petroleum Engineering and Refining from the Colorado School of Mines. Career=Early career Grynberg made his first million dollars by the age of 30 when he formed a company, Oceanic Exploration Co., that reworked a previously drilled gas well that had been abandoned by Amerada Hess Corporation as \\"noncommercial\\". After reviewing and interpreting data from the area, he concluded that Amerada Hess was wrong. His reworked well led to the discovery of the Nitchie Gulch gas field in Wyoming, leading Grynberg to become a millionaire in 1962. From there he engaged in several successful domestic and international oil and gas exploration programs, and took the Oceanic Exploration public in 1972. Later career Grynberg was also instrumental in the 1990s in helping discover the Kashagan Field in Kazakhstan, one of the largest oil field discoveries in the last 30 years. The Kashagan Field is estimated to hold of recoverable oil and of natural gas. Grynberg was one of the first western oilmen to develop relations with Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev before the collapse of the Soviet Union. This relationship and others provided him with access to complex and confidential data. According to court records, it was Grynberg who provided the introductions and data for BG, BP, Statoil, ARCO, Transworld Oil and others to enter the region in the late 1980s and early 1990s. When the consortium of major American oil companies fell apart, BG cut its own deal for the Karachagnak gas/condensate field and attempted to exclude Grynberg from the deal. Grynberg sued in Texas, and much of the Texas court case is sealed. When BP attempted to exclude Grynberg from its 9.5% stake in its Kashagan stake, Grynberg sued them as well in New York including leveling a racketeering charge against then BP CEO John Browne. The case was settled in arbitration. BP and BG both sold their remaining interests in Kashagan in 2003. BG sold to the Sinopec and BP to CNOOC. The combined sales price is estimated to have been $1.23 billion, of which Grynberg may have received as much as 15% of ($185 million). This is in addition to the $90 million that Grynberg is estimated to have received with BP and Statoil previously sold part of their interests to Total for $600 million in 2001. Grynberg is known for defending his rights in court. According to one source, during negotiations involving the Kashagan interests, he ripped up a settlement check for $90 million and demanded appraisal and arbitration.Plats Oilgram News, Wednesday, March 12, 2003 Grynberg reportedly owns more than 800 oil and natural gas well wells throughout the world. He is involved in ventures in the former Soviet Union, Middle East, Africa, Far East and Latin America.Wall Street Journal, October 23, 1996 Grynberg has been focused on a Qui Tam lawsuit against the major oil companies accusing them of stealing billions of dollars in royalties from the U.S. government.Rocky Mountain News, July 4, 2003 Recent ventures Since 2006 Grynberg has been working on developing ethanol plants in Latin America and has received leases and agreements throughout Latin America. In 2006 through 2007, it is reputed that Grynberg entered into discussions with Ivanhoe Energy (IVAN: NASDAQ) to provide services from their heavy oil unit for his leases in the Pungarayacu Tar Sands Heavy Oil Deposit in Ecuador. According to public court records, Grynberg has argued that after meeting to discuss services and joint venture opportunities, and sharing proprietary geotechnical data, Ivanhoe then circumvented Grynberg and bribed the previous Ecuadorian president, who canceled the Grynberg lease and awarded it to Ivanhoe. The current president of Ecuador has acknowledged the issues at stake. The case is currently open against Ivanhoe and Robert Friedland, Chairman, President and CEO of Ivanhoe.

Few of the surrounding areas were electrified, making the Fair a magical sight after dark. The California Midwinter International Exposition of 1894, commonly referred to as the \\"Midwinter Exposition\\" or the \\"Midwinter Fair\\", was a World's Fair that officially operated from January 27 to July 5 in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park. In 1892, U.S. President Benjamin Harrison appointed Michael H. de Young as a national commissioner to the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition held in Chicago. During the exposition in Chicago, de Young recognized an opportunity to stimulate California's economy in its time of depression. In the summer of 1893, de Young announced his plans for the California Midwinter International Exposition to be held in Golden Gate Park. One of the draws, according to de Young, was California's weather, which would allow for a fair in the middle of winter. Golden Gate Park Superintendent John McLaren fought against holding the exposition in the park claiming,\\"the damage to the natural setting would take decades to reverse.\\" In August 1893, the U.S. Congress approved for the fair to be held in Golden Gate Park. Prior to the Midwinter Fair's opening day, in 1893, Isaiah West Taber won the concession to be the official photographer of the fair. Taber documented the fair from when the grading of the land began, and continued photographing the fair throughout its entirety. He sold his photos in a striking, multi-story pavilion during the exposition, on the fair grounds. At the end of the fair, he compiled about 130 of his original photographs into a souvenir book entitled Souvenir of the California Midwinter International Exposition. Much of what is known about the fair, especially visually, comes from Taber's photographs. The fair encompassed 200 acres centered on the park's current Music Concourse. 120 structures were constructed for the exposition,The Official History of the California Midwinter International Exposition. San Francisco: H.S. Crocker Company. 1895.(p.56-57) and more than 2 million people visited. The fair was to feature four major buildings. These buildings included the Fine Arts Building, the Agriculture and Horticulture Building, the Mechanical Arts Building, and the Manufacturers and Liberal Arts building. The Fine Arts building has become the M.H. de Young Memorial Museum (and has been rebuilt in a much different design). Other major attractions include the park's famed Japanese Tea Garden, Bonet's Tower, the amusement attractions, and the many cultural exhibits. Background In 1893, M. H. de Young, a San Francisco local who attended the Chicago World Fair, realized that California could reap major benefits from hosting its own world fair. De Young envisioned a world fair in the middle of winter, where people from the frigid East coast and all over the world could enjoy the nice crisp weather of California, along with its bountiful opportunities. Furthermore, de Young sought to boost California's economy, which was faltering and weakening. During this time period, California and the rest of the country was struggling during one of the 19th century's worst depressions. De Young and other leaders believed that a world fair in San Francisco would create jobs and stimulate the local economy. However, their grander vision was to promote California as a land of endless opportunities, with good weather and arable lands. Support for de Young's plan came immediately. De Young held a series of meetings in Chicago, and declared that he had raised $41,500 in just two weeks since announcing his intentions. In a short amount of time, 4,400 exhibitors committed to move from Chicago to San Francisco in support of the fair. Mayor Levi Richard Ellert of San Francisco and Governor Henry Markham of California both expressed support for the plan. The public also showed their support by donating various amounts. Mayor Ellert established a Finance Committee, which was charged with raising and maintaining the necessary funds. This committee's main strategy was to collect donations from the public. As a result, the fair was financed entirely by donations, and it did not receive any federal, state, or local bonds, loans, grants, or subsidies. In the end, the fair raised $344, 319.59. The fair then began and ended without any debt.  Grand Court buildings  The Midway, with the Administration Building at left  Administration Building  The Administration Building was built at the western end of the Grand Court, where the current Spreckels Temple of Music is today. The main purpose of the building was for offices of the fairs department chiefs and other general administrators of the fair. The architecture of the Administration Building was decided by Arthur Page Brown. His design featured Arabic, Byzantine, Gothic and Islamic styles. It featured a 135-foot-tall dome with figures in relief. The building was three stories and was illuminated almost entirely by natural light. During the night, the building could be seen from miles away because it was lit up entirely by incandescent lamps.  Agriculture and Horticulture Building  The Agriculture and Horticulture Building was located just west of the Fine Arts building, and is part of where the DeYoung Museum stands today. It was designed by Samuel Newsom. It cost $58,000, and was designed in a California Mission style with Romanesque influence. It featured three domes to let in light for the plants. Inside, there were plants and flowers, California foliage, and statues. Fruit from the south, grain and livestock from the Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys, and strawberries and artichokes from the Salinas Valley, as well as California's winter crops were featured.  Bonet Tower  The Bonet Tower was a large steel tower set in the center of the Grand Court of Honor that harnessed the recent discovery of electrical lighting, designed by French architect Leopold Bonet. Standing at 266-feet, the Bonet Tower was approximately a third the size of the Eiffel Tower, after which it was modeled. The tower was adorned with 3,200 multicolored lights. The top level of the tower housed a spotlight which was used to illuminate popular locations in the park, as well as the nearby Lone Mountain. The tower proved to be the largest source of income for the fair, as elevator rides to the top cost $0.25, and rides to the first level cost $0.10. Bonet's Tower remained standing for 2 years until John McLaren called for it to be destroyed with high-powered explosives.  Fine Arts Building  The Fine Arts Building, now the de Young Museum, was built in Golden Gate Park to hold the pieces of art that were commissioned for the Midwinter Exposition. The building was designed in a \\"pseudo‚ÄìEgyptian Revival style and decoratively adorned with images of Hathor, the Egyptian cow goddess.\\" The building itself was a brick structure built 50 feet high with a skylit roof supported by iron trusses. After the Midwinter Exposition ended, the Fine Arts Building was made into a free and public museum, having most of the art from the Expo donated by the artists. The Fine Arts Building lasted for 11 years before an earthquake in 1906 ruined the integrity of the original building, which led to a year and a half closure for repairs. In 1929, four years after de Young's death, the original Fine Arts building was finally torn down. The Fine Arts Building featured the artwork of sixty-eight artists, twenty-eight of whom were female. Many of these female artists received their education at the California School of Design, which eventually became today's San Francisco Art Institute. At the time, the California School of Design accepted women as students, and hired females as instructors. Many of the women showcased at the Midwinter Fair came to San Francisco after showing in exhibits at the Columbian Exposition in Chicago. For example, Evelyn McCormick and Clara McChesney had work featured in both expositions. Some of the other female artists featured in the Fine Arts Building included Alice Chittendon, Helen Hyde, Matilda Lotz, Dora Williams, Eva Withrow and several more. The artwork produced by these women consisted of various oil paintings, many focusing on California. \\"At a time when camera film could make only black and white images, their colorful paintings of famous early California subjects are visual memories of important local history.\\"  Manufactures and Liberal Arts Building  The Moorish- style Manufactures and Liberal Arts Building was located on the east end of the concourse, closest to the Panhandle. It was designed by Arthur Page Brown, and cost $113,000 to build. Divided into three sections, it featured manufactures, liberal arts, and ethnology/archaeology. The liberal arts division featured a display from University of California, Yale University, Cogswell Technical School, Mills College, and the California School for the Deaf and Dumb as well as the other private schools. There was also a display from the astronomical department of the Lick Observatory. The manufactures division featured many displays from the Columbian Exhibition in Chicago. The ethnology/archaeology division featured models, statues, inventions, and weapons from thirty-eight different locations on the globe. It was used as a store for commercial goods, with imports from across the globe. The building was the largest building in the fair, and considered the largest building in California at the time.  Mechanical Arts Building  The Mechanical Arts Building was designed by Edward Swain. It occupied \\"an acre space of (300' x 160')\\" right where the California Academy of Sciences stands today. The building both displayed and conducted the machinery needed to run the electricity throughout the park. It also displayed the \\"latest in mechanical engineering science\\". The center of the building held a gilded globe representing California's total reported yield of gold to date. In 1894, this gilded globe weighed over 2,000 tons and was worth \\"$1.3 billion, or over $32 billion converted to current values\\".  Other buildings = Emergency Hospital  The emergency hospital of the Midwinter Exposition was established in connection with the police station at the heart of Golden Gate Park in an oval of land known as the Grand Court of Honor. The plot was located between the North and South drives of the park and consisted of five major buildings. One major structure was the Administration Building, next to which stood the emergency hospital. It attracted much attention at the fair due to its unusual cross-shaped structure and large red, painted crosses. The building was officially named Lengfeld's Pharmacy after Dr. A. L. Lengfeld who established the College of Pharmacy at the University of California. Lengfeld's Pharmacy in itself became an unintentional exhibit of modern, clean and efficient medicine at the Midwinter Exposition during a time that medical procedures were gaining significant societal interest. The emergency hospital was equipped with a team of physicians and an ambulance service. Initially, Martin Regensberger, the resident physician of the medical facility, was unable to find a local ambulance for his use. De Young obtained an ambulance built for the Columbian Exposition in Chicago the year before and brought it to San Francisco. Following the exposition, the ambulance was purchased by Theresa Fair, the future owner of San Francisco's Fairmont Hotel. Theresa Fair donated the ambulance to the city and it gave rise to the first and oldest continuously operating municipal ambulance service in the United States. Nearly 2000 cases were treated during the Fair, ranging from small cuts and burns to life-threatening injuries. There were a number of large accidents at the Fair that required the use of the emergency hospital. One of the most famous tales is of an overloaded stagecoach of dancers that overturned and injured thirteen people. There was a mistake in the hustle of the incident, and an onlooker accidentally pulled the fire alarm instead of contacting the hospital. The mishap was eventually sorted and the single ambulance of the emergency hospital then made thirteen trips between the hospital and the location of the accident in the ‚Äô49 Mining Camp.  Santa Barbara Amphibia  The Santa Barbara Amphibia was an exhibit encompassing 76' by 56' feet, which held many species of marine life that made the Santa Barbara channel their home. The interior contained a large tank in a L-shaped fashion that contained 40,000 gallons of sea water to emulate the natural environment of the animals. Behind the tank there were rookeries and grottos terraced like the Channel Islands; the sea lions, sea tigers, and sea-otters natural habitat . However, not all the marine animals were alive. Most notably on display was a pickled Basking shark adjacent to the tank of water. The Mayor of Santa Barbara, Edward W. Gaty, spent months carefully preparing what was to be a demonstration of Santa Barbara‚Äôs channel. Along with sea-lions, sea-otters, and leopard sharks, he also sent Mexican leather work, seashells, and an array of mosses. As a last-minute decision Mayor Gaty added the El Montecito Spanish band to play string music for the delectation of sightseers.  Exhibits and rides = Boone's Wild Animal Show  The Daniel Boone's Wild Animal Show was a popular show that had a \\"collection of trained and wild animals is simply wonderful and delights both young and old.\\" It was centered around the lion trainer that it was named after. This show was also the site of one of the most violent events to occur at the fair. Carlo Thieman was an attendant at the lion exhibit at the show. In February, he was attending to the lions while in the cage with them, when the electric lights went out. The show usually kept lanterns lit nearby to deter lions from attacking in the dark, but for some unknown reason the lanterns were not there. The audience was present and heard the man's screams and calls for help, but they were too busy panicking at the horrific ordeal to help. Boone tried to enter the cage, but the door was stuck, delaying him several precious seconds. He finally entered the cage, hit the lions with metal bars, and shouted to get them to leave Thieman alone. Eventually, someone lit lanterns and the grisly scene was lit up for the onlookers to observe. Thieman had been scalped and scratched all over the body, the lions had tried to reach his vitals but narrowly missed. He was brought to Receiving Hospital, still alive, and regained consciousness. He told the details of how the biggest of the lions named Farnell had been the first to attack, and then the other two had followed suit. Thieman had 18 years of experience and the lions themselves were considered to be trained animals. After the attack, the performance was discontinued. Thieman died on February 14, 1894, due to his injuries.  Amusement rides  The Firth Wheel at the California Midwinter International Exposition of 1894 The Midwinter fair included amusement rides as part of the entertainment. Dante's Inferno was among the four amusement rides the fair offered. This scare exhibit had passengers enter through the mouth of a gold dragon head. The Firth Wheel, named after its designer and first referred to as the vertical merry-go-round, was a replication of the first ferris wheel built for the Chicago World Fair. The Firth wheel, standing at 120 feet above the ground and able to carry ten people per carriage, took up to twenty minutes to complete a full rotation. The scenic railway, another ride of the midwinter fair, was \\"an early wooden roller-coaster with a dozen undulating rises and dips\\". The passengers could \\"get a view of the entire Fair and a roller coaster ride at the same time\\".  The Haunted Swing  The Haunted Swing was a notable ride during 1894 in the San Francisco Chronicle. It was said to have caused riders to pray to the biblical saint of their choosing, as most were baffled by how the ride managed to appear to make the room spin 360-degrees vertically. Although the room surrounding the riders caused the riders to feel as though they were spinning, they actually never left a stationary position; the room in which the riders sat spun on an axis, creating the illusion.  Mining Camp  The Mining Camp was one of the most unique and popular exhibits in the fair. It was located on the North slope of Strawberry Hill and cost around $2,500 to construct. The Mining Camp provided food, games, and an interpretation of what life was like for California miners in 1849. Complete with a painted backdrop of Mount Shasta, the camp and many attractions such as a stagecoach which was held up daily by bandits, gambling tables, a dance hall, saloon, and gold-panning sluices. A man with a banjo sat on top of the stagecoach top. When the coach would stop, he would start to play \\"The Days of '49\\" and workers in the Mining Camp would join in during the chorus of \\"the days of old, the days of gold, the days of '49.\\" The Mining Camp also housed replica cabins of famous California figures, such as American industrialist John W. Mackay, California senator George C. Perkins, and writer Mark Twain. The exhibit cost visitors an extra 25 cents to see, almost half of the 55-cent entry fee to the fair. The '49 Dance Hall and the '49 Theatre were extensions of the exhibit. Each cost an additional 25 cents to enter. The Camp even had its own newspaper called the Weekly Midwinter Appeal which was edited by Sam Davis. The dance hall was one of the most popular attraction within the Mining Camp. One reason for the popularity and appeal of the dance hall is the charming Spanish dancers. Exhibits like the dance hall allowed men to indulge in their fantasies. = Controversy = The Mining Camp was designed to let visitors experience what life was like in San Francisco before industrialization and immigrants started moving into the city. It was meant for people to reminisce on the \\"good old days\\" and let go of the anxieties of increasing job competition. \\"The days of old, the days of gold, the days of '49\\" was a slogan for the Mining Camp. It came from the popular song \\"The Days of '49,\\" written by Tom Moore, which reminisced on the time of the Gold Rush. The ending of the song goes as follows: \\"Since that time how things have changed. In this land of liberty. Darkies didn't vote nor plead in court. Nor rule this country; But the Chinese question, the worst of all, In those days did not shine, For the country was right and the boys all white. In the days of '49.\\" These last lines of the song represent some of the controversy with the camp. Some people argue that the Mining Camp whitewashed the history of the Gold Rush by not including people of color and made people long for the days before where minorities did not have many privileges.  The Gum Girls  One controversial feature of the Midwinter Exhibition were the gum girls. These young women would walk around selling chewing gum to the attendees of the fair. They wore blue dresses, black stockings, and coordinating caps.The Official History of the California Midwinter International Exposition, 1894: a Descriptive Record of the Origin, Development and Success .. H.S. Crocker., 1894, pg.162 To many at the time, their dresses were considered short for revealing their ankles. The gum girls were known to flirt with men all around the fairgrounds as a way to sell their gum. An article from The Examiner even advised men that the gum girls would provide them with enjoyable flirtations while they are at the fair.Berglund, Barbara. \\"California Midwinter Fair of 1894: Women's Work and Vice.\\" FoundSF, FoundSF, www.foundsf.org/index.php?title=California_Midwinter_Fair_of_1894%3A_Women%E2%80%99s_Work_and_Vice. The girls had a song they all whistled that was called \\"Two Little Girls in Blue,\\" and they whistled it whenever they made a sale. This song was heard so frequently that it was whistled by people all over the park.Chandler, Arthur, and Marvin Nathan. The Fantastic Fair: the Story of the California Midwinter International Exposition, Golden Gate Park, San Francisco, 1894. Pogo Press, 1993, pg. 21‚Äì22 Throughout their time at the fair, the gum girls were often subjected to danger and unwanted attention. The girls would travel in pairs in order to keep men from getting too touchy or aggressive. In one case, a gum girl by the name of Violet Eilids had the necktie of her dress grabbed by a man. As a reaction to this unwanted advancement, Eilids punched him in the face and broke his nose.  Ethnological exhibits  Hawaiian Village Exhibit In the late 1800s, ethnological exhibitions began to develop as a form of public entertainment and cultural education on non-Western lifestyles. These exhibits showcased groups of individuals from various places all over the world in exhibits designed to mimic their homes. The inhabitants of many of the exhibits would remain in the exhibit until the end of the fair. The Midwinter Exposition of 1894 featured several ethnological expositions: the Hawaiian village, the Dahomeyan African village, various Japanese cultural exhibits, the Vienna Prater, the Arizona Indian Village, the Sioux Indian Village, the Oriental Village, a German Village, a Samoan Village, and the Eskimo/Inuit Village. The ethnological exhibits sparked controversy, particularly from the racial communities that identified with the ethnic groups on display. Many argued that the portrayal of these people groups were stereotypical, reductive, and racist, drawing criticism from Frederick Douglass and San Francisco's Japanese population. Furthermore, treatment of the people living in the exhibitions was criticized, though little action could be taken as the people living there were there of their own accord.  Dahomeyan Village  The Dahomeyan Village showcased Africans from French Congo, French Guinea, and Benin. These individuals were recruited by Xavier Pen√©, a French ivory trader and labor contractor who was permitted to exhibit an African village after putting on the same exhibit for the Chicago World Fair the previous year. There were 67 individuals in the Dahomeyan village, with four deaths throughout the duration of the exhibit. Frederick Douglass both condemned and praised the Dahomeyan Village, stating on separate occasions that it was \\"as if to shame the Negro [that] the Dahomians are also here to exhibit the Negro as a repulsive savage\\" and that \\"the Africans' dance and ceremonies which were all on the same principle, if not quite so well developed, as those of people living nearer to civilization.\\" Douglass' remarks directed public attention towards the negative inner-workings of the cultural exhibits.  Marsh's Japanese Village & Tea Garden  Marsh's Japanese Village & Tea Garden, along with the Fine Arts building which later became the deYoung museum, are the only remnants of the Midwinter Fair that remain in Golden Gate Park. Today it is officially known as the Japanese Tea Garden. George Turner Marsh, an Australian businessman interested in Japanese culture, organized and funded the Japanese Village and Tea Garden for the Midwinter Fair of 1894. During the time of the fair, Marsh and a Japanese artist named Toshio Aoki designed and maintained the village as an attraction. Inside the village in 1894, the village consisted of small man-made waterfalls, small lakes, the Taiko Bashi (drum bridge), and various Japanese- native plants and birds such as Tsurus and O'Hikis. As a part of the exhibit, there were Japanese women dressed up as the \\"Musumee\\" are in the exhibit's tea village. Common items served were Japanese tea and \\"sweetmeats\\". At the time, the exhibit accepted entry for 25 cents an adult and 10 cents for children, tea and treats included. Marsh also envisioned a Japanese form of transportation in the fair to the village, and hired workers to roll Jinrickshas. = Controversy = During the Midwinter Fair, there was controversy surrounding the Japanese Village and Tea Garden. The main issue was the use of rickshaws in the attraction, specifically, George Marsh hiring Japanese men to pull American fair-goers around in rickshaws. Members of the Japanese community were extremely offended, claiming that \\"it was acceptable for Japanese to pull people around in Japan, but in America such a job was suitable only for horses and was an insult to the emperor.\\" Those upset with Marsh decided to form an Anti-Jinrikishaw Society, announcing that any Japanese who decided to pull a rickshaw would be killed. Marsh avoided the problem completely by hiring Germans to pull the tourists around, he also \\"darkened their faces and dressed them in oriental garb.\\"  Eskimo Village  Eskimaux Village with reindeer and dog team The Eskimo Village was three acres large and featured native Inuit from Labrador, Canada. The Inuit villagers in the exhibit lived in huts designed to look like igloos and seal- skin tents. Visitors to the exhibit could ride on a dog-drawn sled around a circular track.  Oriental Village  Egyptian Hall and Oriental Village The Oriental Village featured Turkish, Greek, Algerian, and Egyptian cultures. The central axis of the exhibit was Cairo street, based on an Egyptian market street. The street was lined by storefronts and inhabited by shopkeepers and people paid to enact daily street life, including a fortune-teller. Beyond the Egyptian-inspired Cairo street was a Turkish Theater and Dance hall, which featured performances by Turkish dancers. Outside the front of the building, a small bazaar-style marketplace where Turkish, Greek, and Algerian vendors sold various wares.  Hawaiian Village  The centerpiece of the Hawaiian Village was a cyclorama painted to look like an erupting Mount Kilauea where performers danced, chanted, and performed religious rituals daily for the visitors. Also included in the exhibit were grass-covered bamboo huts, the Hawaiian Palace, coffee trees, hula dancers, and a display depicting the history of the Hawaiian Kamehameha dynasty as well as showcasing various weapons of war. A rectangular artificial lake was dug out in the southern corner of the exhibit, providing an area for the exhibit's inhabitants to showcase canoe maneuvers to visitors. The Hawaiian Palace was furnished with imported Hawaiian furniture and wares.  Food  The cuisine of the Midwinter Exposition was as diverse as the rest of the world fair. Restaurants operated in the Chinese, Japanese, and Oriental Villages, in the Old Heidelberg, at the Firth Wheel, and at the base of Bonet's Tower among other places. There were additional kiosks and vendors from which fair attendees could buy food. The cultural exhibits provided exotic meals that were exceptionally popular among fair goers. It was also quite common to bring food from home and picnic in the park.  The Fair's Legacy  Upon the conclusion of the Midwinter Exposition, Park Superintendent John McLaren took his revenge for what was done to his park. McLaren had created Golden Gate Park with the intention of making it a natural escape within the city, and to him, the development of the fair ruined its natural scenery. Although the management of the fair agreed to restore the park grounds, they didn't follow through with this promise. McLaren himself had most of the one hundred buildings torn down and the concrete foundations dug up. He feared Bonet's Tower would become a permanent attraction in his park, so he had it dynamited and sold for scraps. However, McLaren spared some structures that can still be seen in the park today. The Fine Arts Building, now the De Young Museum, the Japanese Village, along with multiple statues and parts of the Court of Honor still exist in the park. Mayor Adolph Sutro saved some attractions of the fair before McLaren's destruction. Sutro purchased the Camera Obscura, the Firth Wheel, Dante's Inferno, the Mirror Maze, along with multiple other Midway attractions and had them relocated to the Sutro Baths which opened in 1896.  Remaining sculptures  Many works of art from the Midwinter Fair can still be seen at Golden Gate Park today. Some of the sculptures remaining include the Apple Cider Press, Roman Gladiator, Prayer Book Cross, Dor√© Vase, and two sphinxes. The Dor√© Vase, created by French sculptor Gustave Dor√©, is an 11-foot bronze sculpture that speaks to the valued process of winemaking. The Apple Cider Press, a monument created by American artist Thomas Shields Clarke, was said to be a working cider fountain during the fair. Both the Dor√© Vase and the Apple Cider Press can be seen in front of the De Young museum today. The third sculpture was traditionally called Roman Gladiator. This bronze sculpture, created by George Geefs in 1884, has been identified as Leonidas, King of Sparta. It was exhibited at the 1894 Midwinter Fair, and then moved to the spot where Michael de Young turned the first spade of dirt to begin construction of the fair. The Prayer Book Cross, created by Ernest Coxhead, is a 57-foot sandstone Celtic cross that was a gift from the Church of England to commemorate the first Anglican service held in the English language in California.

It is built by UD Trucks for the Japanese market, and by the Renault-Nissan Alliance for the European market. The lighter range vehicles, weighing from 1 to 1.5 tons, replaced the earlier Cabstar and Homer (F20), while the heavier Caball and Clipper (C340) were replaced by the 2-to-4 ton range Atlas. The Atlas nameplate was first introduced in December 1981, available at Nissan Bluebird Store locations. The Atlas is known also as the Nissan Cabstar, Renault Maxity, Samsung SV110/Yamuzin and Ashok Leyland Partner depending on the location. The range has been sold across the world. F22/H40=Japan Nissan Atlas (F22) Manufacturing of the heavier range (H40-series) began in December 1981, while the lighter series Atlas (F22) was introduced in February 1982. The first generation Atlas was available with a wide range of petrol and diesel engines: The Z16 and Z20 (as well as the LPG- powered Z20D) were petrol units, while diesels included the TD23, TD27, ED33, FD35, and the turbodiesel FD35T. Europe The Atlas F22 was sold in Europe as the Nissan Cabstar and proved a popular truck in the UK market due to its reliability and ability to carry weight. The F22 Cabstar was available in the British market with the 1,952 cc Z20S OHC petrol engine. From 1990 the range widened and was sold as the Cabstar E.Road Transport Road Test In Taiwan, the F22 continued to be sold as the \\"Yue Loong Homer\\". It was also used as recreational truck (motorhome conversions). It proved to be serious competition for the dated Bedford CF and Ford Transit which were its main competitors. The trucks popularity in the African market saw vast majority of the remaining early UK F22 models being exported to Africa. Australia Australia was another important market for the Atlas, where it took over after the previous Nissan Caball which was sold there from 1970 to 1981. It was later marketed as the Nissan Cabstar (1984‚Äì1992). It was built in Australia using many local components.

It later changed its name to Yamuzin (Hangul:ÏïºÎ¨¥ÏßÑ). South Korean truck drivers, however, expect to be able to overload their vehicles, which the Atlas could not handle very well. Unlike the Hyundai Porter and Kia Bongo, the Yamuzin's cargo space can't hold the overload. In 2000 Samsung commercial vehicles discontinued their lineup due to bankruptcy.  F24/H43  Nissan Atlas F24 Japan The Atlas is available in two versions: the F24 and H43.

N. Samuel wrote several books on Lutheran history, theology, and practical Christian living. He wrote for children, too. He wrote in Tamil and German. He also translated several books from German to Tamil. Some of the books authored by him are: * Thoopa Kalasam, Censer of Incense * Thiru tiru virunthadi, Pocket Communion Book * Ullathu Narpathu * Pushpa Kodai * Companion to the Village Preacher * Life of Ziegenbalg * Tranquebar Mission History * Village Sermons Vol I Suvisesha Vaakiya Pirasanga Puthagam, sermonic works on the Gospels * Village Sermons Vol II Niruba Vaakiya Pirasanga Puthagam, sermonic works on the Epistles * Plain Talk of a Plain Christian * The Pocket Prayer Book * Martin Luther Sasthriyaar Viviya Sarithira Surukkam * Yerusalem Nagar Alivu * Yezhu Siru Vaarthaigal * Christian Proverbs and Maxims --Naru Malarkothu * Tharangai Mission Sarithiram (Styled after Fenger's History of the Tranquebar Mission) * Orusandhinaal Dhyaanam, meditations for Lent with 40 meditations * Ullathu Solvane For theological students, he wrote: * Samayosidha Vedha Vaakiya Kuripu, concordance * Sathiya Vedhabayiram, an introduction to the Bible * Thiruchabai Varusha Vivaram, Outlines of Church History For children, he wrote: * Children's storybook, Paalar Poocharam * Moral tales, Kadhaa Malar Koodai, Basket of Flowers * Children's prayer book For parents, he wrote: * Petror Ozhukkam His translations: * Mey Manasthaabam kanneer, translation of Heinrich Muller's Tears of Repentance, a booklet that is a good preparation for partaking in the Holy Communion. He was one of those responsible for the translation of a revised version of the New Testament. Pastor Most of his life was spent in Tranquebar, the little port town that welcomed missionaries Bartholomaeus Ziegenbalg (and Heinrich Pl√ºtschau), sent by the king of Denmark in 1706, and Christian Friedrich Schwarz, sponsored at the time by the Danish Missionary Society in Copenhagen. He was ordained on 31 October 1878 at Tranquebar, by senior J. M. N. Schwartz. From that moment on, he served as pastor in the Lutheran Mission (later known as T.E.L.C.) until his death on 20 May 1927, except for a brief stint with the Missouri Mission towards the end of his life from 1921 to 1927. The towns and cities where he served are: Tranquebar (1880-1891 and 1897-1919), Karaikal (1897-1919), Manikramam (1919), Porayar (1917-1919), Bangalore (1921), and Madras. He preached his last sermon on 1 May 1927 in the Lutheran Adikalanathar Church, Purasawalkam, Madras, on John 10:11-16. Theologian His theology was rooted in Lutheran Pietism, a renewed form of the post-reformation Lutheranism that was held by theologians in Halle in the 16th century, such as August Hermann Francke, 1663‚Äì1727 and Philipp Jakob Spener, 1635-1705 He was well versed with the life, works, and teachings of Martin Luther. He was a great lover of Spurgeon's works, and possessed many of his books in his library. After reading John Ploughman's Talk and John Ploughman's Pictures, he wrote Ullathu Solvane. Rev. N. Samuel was known as Tamil Spurgeon, although it is not clear if he was thus known because of his strictness in doctrinal matters or because of his homiletic gifts. He was also familiar with Waltharian views of Lutheranism. His allegiance was to God first and only then to his church. When it was time for the German missionaries to leave India, leaving the leadership on Indian shoulders, it was decided that the church would follow an Episcopal form of church government. Rev. N. Samuel felt that this and other innovations that were introduced were not according to the Biblical model and protested. When he realised that change was inevitable, in the middle of 1921, he left the T.E.L.C that he had served all his life, and joined the Missouri Mission. He returned to the T.E.L.C. in 1927 shortly before his death.

The autodyne circuit was an improvement to radio signal amplification using the De Forest Audion vacuum tube amplifier. By allowing the tube to oscillate at a frequency slightly different from the desired signal, the sensitivity over other receivers was greatly improved. The autodyne circuit was invented by Edwin Howard Armstrong of Columbia University, New York, NY. He inserted a tuned circuit in the output circuit of the Audion vacuum tube amplifier. By adjusting the tuning of this tuned circuit, Armstrong was able to dramatically increase the gain of the Audion amplifier. Further increase in tuning resulted in the Audion amplifier reaching self-oscillation. This oscillating receiver circuit meant that the then latest technology continuous wave (CW) transmissions could be demodulated. Previously only spark, interrupted continuous wave (ICW, signals which were produced by a motor chopping or turning the signal on and off at an audio rate), or modulated continuous wave (MCW), could produce intelligible output from a receiver. When the autodyne oscillator was advanced to self- oscillation, continuous wave Morse code dots and dashes would be clearly heard from the headphones as short or long periods of sound of a particular tone, instead of an all but impossible to decode series of thumps. Spark and chopped CW (ICW) were amplitude modulated signals which didn't require an oscillating detector. Such a regenerative circuit is capable of receiving weak signals, if carefully coupled to an antenna. Antenna coupling interacts with tuning, making optimum adjustments difficult. Heterodyne detection=Damped wave transmission Early transmitters emitted damped waves, which were radio frequency sine wave bursts of a number of cycles duration, of decreasing amplitude with each cycle. These bursts recurred at an audio frequency rate, producing an amplitude modulated transmission. The damped waves were a result of the available technologies to generate radio frequencies. See spark gap transmitter. The transmitters could be keyed on and off to send Morse code. Receivers could be made with a tuned circuit, a crystal detector, and a headphone. The headphone would respond to the detected bursts, and the operator could copy the Morse code. The received signal was not a sinewave. Instead of a crystal detector, a Fleming valve (tube diode) could be used; it was a stable detector, but not very sensitive. Even better was a using a vacuum triode because it provided some amplification. The regenerative receiver supplied even more gain, but required careful adjustment. Undamped wave transmission Damped wave transmission had drawbacks, and the focus shifted to undamped waves or continuous wave (CW) transmission. The arc converter could produce high power CW transmissions. The typical damped wave receiver was ineffective for receiving CW because CW had, ideally, no modulation of the radio frequency during the period of the dot or dash. Several methods were employed to generate an audible tone at the receiver: (1) a chopper, (2) a variable condensor with rotating plates (slope demodulation), (3) a tikker, (4) a separate heterodyne, and (5) the autodyne. Fessenden researched the heterodyne detector. Application The autodyne was widely used in both commercially produced and amateur receiver designs from shortly after the time of its invention until the middle 1930s. It became popular at the beginning of the Depression (ca early 1930s) for first detector applications in superheterodyne receivers. P. R. Mallory & Co., MYE Technical Manual, Indianapolis: P. R. Mallory & Co., 1942, p. 32 More recently, autodyne converters are employed in radio receivers for the AM and FM broadcast band. A single transistor combines the functions of amplifier, mixer and local oscillator of an otherwise conventional superheterodyne receiver. Such a stage accepts as input the antenna signal, and provides an output to the intermediate frequency amplifier. In this application, the transistor is made to self-oscillate at the local oscillator frequency. The autodyne detector has appeared in specialized fields in the 1960s through the 1990s..

Founded in 1841 and located on the banks of the Concord River, the cemetery is one of the oldest garden cemeteries in the nation, inspired by Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Many of Lowell's wealthy industrialists are buried here, under ornate Victorian tombstones. A portion of the cemetery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. Description and history The cemetery is located in the central eastern part of the city, roughly bounded on the north by Fort Hill Park, on the east by Shedd Park, on the south by railroad tracks, and on the west by the Concord River, from which it is separated by Lawrence Street, where its historic main gate is located. It occupies 84 acres of rolling terrain, much of which has been developed. The main gate is a monumental granite structure designed by C. W. Painter and built in 1862. There is a secondary gate on Knapp Avenue at the cemetery's northeast corner, which was added in 1905. There are two buildings in the cemetery: the Talbot Memorial Chapel (1885) and the Superintendent's Office (1887), both Gothic Revival structures designed by Boston architect Frederick Stickney. Roadways in the cemetery were laid out to take advantage of the natural terrain, occasionally providing vistas. The main circulation route, Washington Avenue, roughly encircles the property, with several roads providing access across the central areas. The cemetery was laid out in 1841 to a design by George P. Worcester, a civil engineer, applying principles of the rural cemetery movement that was then just coming into vogue. The cemetery has a wide variety of funerary art in diverse styles, from typical Victorian forms to the Egyptian Revival and Art Deco. Many prominent Lowell residents of the 19th and 20th centuries are interred here. Ayer Lion, resting place of Dr. James Cook Ayer, patent medicine tycoon.

Life and career=Early years Denny with Jessie Bond in The Yeomen of the Guard, 1888 Denny was born William Henry Leigh Dugmore at Balsall Heath, Birmingham, England. His mother, Mrs. Henry Leigh, was the original Diana in Gilbert and Sullivan's first collaboration, Thespis (1871).\\"Our Portraits\\", The Theatre, 1 March 1892, p. 144Rees, p. 102 Denny appeared as the child in The Stranger in Worcester at the age of six.\\"The Man Who Plays the Ass\\", The Advertiser, 6 July 1903, p. 6 He played juvenile parts for several years, tackling his first adult role at the Theatre Royal, Dundee in 1870. Denny's first role in London was at Sadler's Wells Theatre in an 1872 revival of Mazeppa, a dramatisation of Byron's poem based on a legend about Ivan Mazeppa. He played the role of Simple in 1874 in The Merry Wives of Windsor at the Gaiety Theatre, London. After a series of roles in Shakespeare plays and in works by H. J. Byron, he was engaged by Richard D'Oyly Carte in 1876 for a tour as Trenitz in La fille de Madame Angot, Barthel in The Duke's Daughter, and Tarapote in La P√©richole. Denny then toured America for three years with Lydia Thompson, also appearing in Philadelphia under the management of Mrs. John Drew. as The Grand Inquisitor in The Gondoliers Returning to London in 1879, Denny appeared as Charles Freeman in Marie Litton's production of The Beaux' Stratagem, and in her subsequent productions, in a company including John Hare and the Kendals.

While he was in the run of the latter, Arthur Sullivan saw him, and invited him to audition for the Savoy Theatre . Savoy Theatre years as Scaphio in Utopia, Limited Denny joined the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company at the Savoy to replace Rutland Barrington in 1888 and remained there until 1893. He created the roles of Wilfred Shadbolt in The Yeomen of the Guard (1888), the Grand Inquisitor, Don Alhambra del Bolero, in The Gondoliers (1889) and Bumbo in The Nautch Girl (1891). He next played Bedford Rowe in the revival of The Vicar of Bray (1892), and he created the character of The McCrankie in Haddon Hall (1892), leaving the company when the run was completed. In 1893, he appeared in a musical comedy called Poor Jonathan before returning to D'Oyly Carte to create the part of Scaphio in Utopia, Limited (1893). He again left the company at the end of the run of that show. Later years After leaving the Savoy, Denny appeared again in musicals in London from 1895 to 1897. He created the roles of Pilkington Jones in Gentleman Joe (1895) and Robert White in Dandy Dan (1897). He later toured Australia and New Zealand in a Shakespeare company, playing Bottom and Touchstone. He was back on the New York stage beginning in 1905, appearing on Broadway in Julius Caesar (1902), The Proud Laird (a comedy, 1905), The Earl and the Girl (a musical, 1906), The Hypocrites (a drama, 1906), The Beauty Spot (a musical, 1909), The Gay Hussars (an operetta, 1909), Madame X (a melodrama, 1910), and The Blue Bird (a play, 1911). He once more returned to London, making his last appearance there as Stuff, a theatre manager, in Walter Browne's Everywoman in 1912. Denny also wrote several one-act plays, the best-known of which was A Mutual Mistake (1891). In addition, he wrote song lyrics, such as \\"How sweet thou art to me\\" (\\"Sleep, gentle sleep\\"), with music by Arthur Weld (1909).

There are three primary benchmarks, West Texas Intermediate (WTI), Brent Blend, and Dubai Crude. Other well-known blends include the OPEC Reference Basket used by OPEC, Tapis Crude which is traded in Singapore, Bonny Light used in Nigeria, Urals oil used in Russia and Mexico's Isthmus. Energy Intelligence Group publishes a handbook which identified 195 major crude streams or blends in its 2011 edition.International Crude Oil Market Handbook, 2011 Benchmarks are used because there are many different varieties and grades of crude oil. Using benchmarks makes referencing types of oil easier for sellers and buyers. There is always a spread between WTI, Brent and other blends due to the relative volatility (high API gravity is more valuable), sweetness/sourness (low sulfur is more valuable) and transportation cost. This is the price that controls world oil market price. West Texas Intermediate (WTI)  West Texas Intermediate (light blue) alongside other selected North American oil benchmarks West Texas Intermediate is used primarily in the U.S. It is light (API gravity) and sweet (low-sulfur) thus making it ideal for producing products like low-sulfur gasoline and low-sulfur diesel. Brent is not as light or as sweet as WTI but it is still a high-grade crude. The OPEC basket is slightly heavier and more sour than Brent. As a result of these gravity and sulfur differences, before 2011 WTI typically traded at a dollar or two premium to Brent and another dollar or two premium to the OPEC basket. Since 2011, WTI has traded at lower prices than Brent. Brent Blend Brent Crude is a mix of crude oil from 15 different oil fields in the North Sea. It is the benchmark used primarily in Europe though it is also mixed in with the OPEC reference basket which is used around the world. Dubai and Oman Dubai Crude, also known as Fateh, is a heavy sour crude oil extracted from Dubai. It is produced in the Emirate of Dubai, part of the United Arab Emirates. Dubai's only refinery, at Jebel Ali, takes condensates as feedstocks, and therefore all of Dubai's crude production is exported. For many years it was the only freely traded oil in the Middle East, but gradually a spot market has developed in Omani crude as well. For many years, most of the oil producers in the Middle East have taken the monthly spot price average of Dubai and Oman as the benchmark for sales to the Far East (WTI and Brent futures prices are used for exports to the Atlantic Basin). In July 2007, a potential new mechanism arose in the form of the Dubai Mercantile Exchange, which offers futures contracts in Omani crude. Whether the DME will be successful, and whether Omani futures prices will be adopted by producers and buyers as a benchmark, remain to be seen. Canadian Crude Edmonton Par and Western Canadian Select (WCS) \\"are benchmarks crude oils for the Canadian market. Both Edmonton Par and Western Canadian Select are high- quality low sulfur crude oils with API gravity levels of around 40¬∞. In contrast, WCS is a heavy crude oil with an API gravity level of 20.5¬∞.\\" The Canadian Crude Index (CCI) serves as a benchmark for oil produced in Canada.http://boereport.com/2016/01/04/auspice-capital-advisors-launches- first-live-index-tied-to-canadian-crude-oil/ It allows investors to track the price, risk and volatility of the Canadian commodity. The CCI provides a fixed price reference for Canadian crude oil and provides an accessible and transparent index to serve as a benchmark to build investable products upon, and could ultimately increase its demand to global markets. Contracts Because of its excellent liquidity and price transparency, the contract is used as a principal international pricing benchmark. The first futures contracts on crude oil were traded in 1983, with the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) and the New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex) both attempting to take advantage of the government's de-regulation of crude oil. CBOT's initial contracts had delivery problems, so customers abandoned it for Nymex.The Asylum, Leah McGrath Goodman, 2011, HarperCollins, p90-91 Crude oil became the world's most actively traded commodity, and the NYMEX Division light sweet crude oil futures contract becoming the world's most liquid form for crude oil trading, as well as the world's largest-volume futures contract trading on a physical commodity. Additional risk management and trading opportunities are offered through options on the futures contract; calendar spread options; crack spread options on the pricing differential of heating oil futures and crude oil futures and gasoline futures and crude oil futures; and average price options. The contract trades in units of 1,000 barrels, and the delivery point is Cushing, Oklahoma, which is also accessible to the international spot markets via pipelines. The contract provides for delivery of several grades of domestic and internationally traded foreign crudes, and serves the diverse needs of the physical market.

Alaskite is a synonym.Glossary Leucogranites have been reported from a variety of orogenies involving continental collisions. Examples include the Black Hills (Trans-Hudson orogeny of Proterozoic age),Peter I. Nabelek and Mian Liu, Petrologic and thermal constraints on the origin of leucogranites in collisional orogens, Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh: Earth Sciences, 95, 73‚Äì85, 2004 the Blue Ridge basement complex (Grenville orogeny of Proterozoic age),Alkali feldspar leucogranite, Mineral Resources, Online Spatial Data, Virginia, USGS the Paleozoic Appalachian orogeny in Maine, and the currently active Himalayan orogeny. The leucogranite magmas are interpreted to have been derived by melting of pelitic rocks in the upper portions of thickened crust. These melts result following deformation and metamorphism, but the heat source is uncertain. Shear-heating associated with large shear zones in the crust has been proposed as the mechanism. Mont Saint-Michel in Normandy, France is made of leucogranite, which solidified from an underground intrusion of molten magma about 525 million years ago during the Cambrian period. A study of sodium-rich quartz-alkali feldspar‚Äîbiotite gneiss granulite facies terrane in the Kerala Khondalite Belt near Manali in south India found that in situ leucosomes (light colored segregations) within the gneiss showed the development of garnet replacing the dark biotite. The study indicated localized melting or migmatization within the gneiss. This was followed by intrusion of the gneiss by garnet-bearing leucogranitic melts both parallel and discordant to the foliation of the gneiss. Strontium isotope ratios of the leucogranite intrusives are distinct from that of the gneiss and associated leucosomes. This indicates the leucogranite melts were not derived from the local gneiss, however the gneiss is isotopically variable and the leucogranite could have derived from subjacent gneiss.Braun I., G.R.

He is a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians (Lond, Edin, Irel, HK), Surgeons (Glas, HK) and Pathologists (UK, HK). After years of clinical and laboratory training, he established the infectious disease service and rapid molecular diagnosis for cytomegalovirus and tuberculosis at the Queen Mary Hospital, the teaching hospital of the University of Hong Kong. His major research interest is microbiology and novel microbes in emerging infectious diseases.  Career  Yuen graduated from the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Hong Kong in 1981 with distinction in Medicine. Initially trained as a surgeon, he switched successfully to a physician and, subsequently, a clinical microbiologist. In the outbreak of avian influenza virus H5N1 in 1997 in Hong Kong, Yuen was the first to report in Lancet about the unusual clinical severity and high mortality of infected patients, which could be identified by the in-house molecular test at his laboratory. During the global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, he led his team in the discovery of the SARS coronavirus, being honoured as \\"Asian heroes of the year\\" in April by Time Asia magazine. Subsequently, he found the natural reservoir of SARS coronavirus like virus in Chinese horseshoe bat and renewed the interest of bats as the source of novel microbes causing emerging infectious diseases. His research laboratory has also identified over 40 new viruses, 9 bacteria, 2 fungi and 2 parasites of which some are suspected or confirmed pathogens: coronavirus HKU1, bat coronavirus HKU2 and others, bovine and porcine hokovirus (now called Tetraparvovirus) and Laribacter hongkongensis in fish and human. Yuen is currently the Chair of Infectious Disease at the Department of Microbiology of the University of Hong Kong. He co-directs the State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Disease of China in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of PRC. He was the founding co- director of the Hong Kong University-Pasteur Research Centre. His over 700 publications (with over 15,000 citations) in peer reviewed journals including Lancet, New England Journal of Medicine, Science, Journal of Virology and PNAS, mainly pertain to novel microbe discovery and agents of emerging infectious diseases.  2019-20 coronavirus  Yuen is involved in the research on SARS-CoV-2. Yuen has been active in communicating with the press on this issue. He was an early advocate of wearing masks even by healthy individuals, citing asymptomatic cases and a large number of virus strands in saliva of an infected person. Yuen's information videos on preventing the spread of the virus are published on the website of the University of Hong Kong. Yuen caused controversy when he and co-author David Lung published an op-ed article titled \\"The pandemic originated from Wuhan and the lessons from 17 years ago have been forgotten.\\" in the Chinese-language newspaper Ming Pao, stating that the trading and consumption of wild animals was a result of the inferior culture of Chinese people. The authors later retracted the article and apologised for the statement. In an interview with the BBC, Yuen accused the Chinese authorities of covering up the scale of the virus. He claimed that he alerted health officials on January 12 to suspected human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2. This warning wasn't made public until January 19. He also accused the authorities of destroying evidence, \\"When we went to the Huanan supermarket, of course, there was nothing to see because the market was clean already. So, you may say that the crime scene is already disturbed because the supermarket was cleared we cannot identify any host which is giving the virus to humans,\\" said Yuen.

Background The band that recorded 9 consisted of John Lydon, bassist Allan Dias, guitarist John McGeoch and drummer Bruce Smith. Former guitarist Lu Edmonds left the band by the time the album was recorded due to problems with tinnitus. However, Edmunds received a writing co-credit on all tracks, although he does not play on the album. Ted Chau, who replaced Edmunds in the band, does not perform on 9. The album was produced by Stephen Hague, Eric \\"ET\\" Thorngren, and the band. Bill Laswell, who had produced Album three years earlier, had originally been lined up to produce 9. However, tension between Laswell and Lydon after the recording of that album, coupled with Laswell's desire to once again use his own cast of session musicians on 9 and his dissatisfaction with Public Image's new line-up, led to the agreement being cancelled. The first album track to be released was \\"Warrior\\", which showed up on the soundtrack album to the movie Slaves of New York, released on 20 March 1989. The track \\"Sand Castles in the Snow\\" was originally titled \\"Spit\\", and was so listed in various Virgin pre- release information. It reached the Top 40 of the UK Singles Chart at number 38.

That was the attitude. But this one is much more happy, much more open. I think it sums up the sense of optimism that really has to be there for these very serious times we live in [...] There is a theme running through [the songs] [...] It's not to take life so seriously, actually, and not to expect too much from anyone, which will at least give them a chance. And that is optimism [...] The songs really were written much, much more for live than record. They were completely and totally rehearsed before they went anywhere near the studio. So the actual recording process was very, very quick. Took us a year to write, and very well worthwhile.‚ÄùNina Ellerman: ‚ÄúDon't Worry, Be Happy?‚Äù (BAM, 16 June 1989) ‚ÄúWe spent a lot of time writing these songs and perfecting them before we went anywhere near a studio to record them. I think that's the main effort of our work, isn't it?‚ÄùAntoine de Caunes: ‚ÄúJohn Lydon and John McGeoch Interview‚Äù (Rapido, BBC Two, 3 May 1989) ‚ÄúI had doubts from the start, but nevertheless I flew to New York with a tape of our songs. Suddenly [Bill Laswell] said he hates our songs, the band is crap and I better fire them and work with the songs he wrote for me. His idea for me was to make some kind of U2 album. So we packed our bags and fucked off.‚ÄùSteve Lake: ‚ÄúPillenknick‚Äù (ME/Sounds, Germany, July 1989) ‚ÄúOriginally we were going to do this with Bill Laswell, but he said the band couldn't play and he hated all our songs, so I told him where to go. We moved to Jason Corsaro, and then that all fell through, so I took it all back to England. It was financially impossible after the Laswell fuck-up. Laswell's ego has become ridiculous, I couldn't deal with it. He said he'd written songs and I should sack the band and use his people and come out with a U2-type product! To me that reeks of clich√© and cop-out. It's very disappointing [...] I won't be dictated to by producers. That's not their job, as far as I'm concerned, their job is clarity, and if you're doing something wrong, to point an easier way around it. Y'know, useful tools. Steve is a musician, and it's very useful to work with people in that way. Eric Thorngren is more like a mad Hells Angel [...] [Lu Edmonds] helped in the writing [...] It's the actual writing of the thing that counts. I'm not going to take anything away from Lu at the moment, life's very hard on him. It's a terrible thing to take a year off of your chosen profession.‚ÄùJason Pettigrew: ‚ÄúTired?‚Äù (Alternative Press, July 1989) ‚ÄúI realise that our new album sounds almost too good and that there's going to be a lot of criticism that we've sold out, but we wanted to make a really professional pop album, so to hell with the critics. Why did we work with guys who produce mainstream acts like Pet Shop Boys and Talking Heads? We didn't have much of a choice, to be honest. We were originally booked to record the album in Los Angeles [sic] with another producer, but on the very day we were due to start, he informed us that the songs stunk and that no one could play.‚ÄùIain Blair: ‚ÄúRotten Johnny ‚Äì Lead Singer Of Public Image Remains A Punk At Heart‚Äù (Chicago Tribune, 30 June 1989) *Allan Dias (1989/2004): ‚ÄúWe miss Lu. It was a shock to have to go in and record without him after he had been involved in the songwriting [...] We put a lot of time into arrangements and melody. This album is more integration of rhythms and melody rather than just really hard grooves on their own.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe give [John Lydon] a cassette, he'll take it away. Two months later you ask him about it, and he'll say 'It's too nice, I don't know what to do with it!' In the final hour he'll come up with something brilliant.‚ÄùNeil Perry: ‚ÄúPublic Image ‚Äì The 9 Lives Of John Lydon‚Äù (Sounds, 22 April 1989) ‚ÄúWe would all have cassettes with some ideas and some songs, and then we would exchange them. We would listen to each others stuff, and I'd pick what I like from their stuff, and they'd pick what they like from mine, whatever. And then we'd sit and try to play this stuff or try to structure it. Sometimes we'd use bits and pieces from each others tunes, yeah. We shared everything equally so it didn't matter whose song initially it was. I think McGeoch was probably the more prolific writer. I think if an album had ten songs, usually four or five came from John McGeoch, three of four would come from me and the others, and then John Lydon would have a couple.‚ÄùScott Murphy: ‚ÄúAllan Dias Interview‚Äù (Fodderstompf.com website, May 2004) *Bruce Smith (1989): ‚ÄúThere were strong characters involved, but it didn't make one character. Rotten's vocals and the music and the compositions have gelled together. On the last record we made, it wasn't there at all [...] I think some of the tracks might suffer from the final mix being a little too smooth, but I certainly would have done it like that.‚Äù *Bill Laswell (producer, 1989): ‚ÄúHe's lost it. Ask him why he delivered a bad disco album.‚Äù *John McGeoch (1990/91): ‚ÄúI don't think '9' was a bummer, but looking back with the luxury of hindsight, I'm more content with 'Happy?'. We in fact started to record '9' with Bill Laswell, but Bill was just out of order I'm afraid. Lydon sacked him on the second day. He wanted to make a heavy metal album. He had us round and it was nothing less than a lecture that he gave us, that the American public needed John Lydon to make a tough heavy metal album. The material that we had written for '9' was written on computers, as was the new stuff, and he said 'This is just disco!' He wanted to throw out Allan and Bruce and use his own musicians.‚ÄùRobin Gibson: ‚ÄúPIL Crazy After All These Years‚Äù (Sounds, 27 October 1990) ‚ÄúWhen we recorded '9', the engineer Dave Meegan recorded a lot of it digitally, but then went and used my noisy old washing machine rack to master it, to get that analogue feel.‚ÄùRick Batey: ‚ÄúCompilation ‚Äì John McGeoch‚Äù (Guitarist, April 1991) *Lu Edmonds (1999): ‚ÄúI think Virgin always wanted Bill Laswell to get involved again, the second time for '9' there was this complete fiasco [...] Virgin negotiated with Laswell on a very flimsy basis to record '9', and Laswell was saying 'Well, the only way I ever record an album is with my own musicians,' and Virgin would go 'Don't worry, we'll send the band anyway, and if you like them you can use them,' and Laswell's going 'It's up to you if you want to take the risk, but if I don't like the band I'm not going to use them!' We went into the studio on the first day, and he made Bruce so nervous by being so cool, he's Mr Cool, and Bruce did all the songs at kind of double speed, he was so nervous. And that night Laswell turned to John and said 'The band won't do!' We'd been there a week ‚Äì we were committed to be there for three ‚Äì and Virgin said 'Well, we did think that might happen.' And suddenly the band are $80,000 in the hole, John was absolutely livid! [...] After this time when we were in New York with Laswell, we did the Estonian date [...] then after that gig I suddenly realised my ears were just ‚Äì I'd had a little tinnitus. Then it got really bad and I went to see a doctor, and he said 'You've got to stop playing.' [...] And I just fell into a huge pit of depression, everything in my life just collapsed. I had to get out and I thought it was better I got out before I was on the album [...] I didn't take any advances for '9' but John gave me the royalties [...] They ended up with Stephen Hague, who also is a great producer, but again, '9' was completely sucked dry of any scruffiness and all that beautiful space. So for me those albums are disappointing because I know they could have been better.‚ÄùScott Murphy: ‚ÄúLu Edmonds Interview‚Äù (The Filth And The Fury#10 fanzine, September 1999) \\"Disappointed\\": *John Lydon (1989/99): \\"'Disappointed' is what it says, it's just about the many and varied ways people let you down.\\"John Lydon liner notes (Public Image Ltd.: \\"Plastic Box\\" compilation, Virgin Records, 1999) \\"But, you know, that's what people will always do.

I opened one up and there was an acoustic guitar with a receipt dated 1969 [...] The tuning on the guitar was D-A-D-A-D-E, bottom to top. That's what I used on 'Disappointed'.\\" \\"Warrior\\": *John Lydon (1989/2004): \\"That's precisely how I see myself ‚Äì fighting off, instead of the US Cavalry, boredom and oppression.\\" \\"I'm making my case quite clear that this is my land and I'm not gonna surrender it easily.

That was a serious club anthem at the time.\\" \\"It's too easy to do an atypical Public Image-type record ‚Äì big, crashing drums and whooping great imitation reggae basslines. All that stuff's been done and I don't wanna do it any more. I'm much more interested in other directions. Now, if people conceive that as being commercial on my part, then I'd like them to define commercial because the record sales really aren't that hot. But we are imitated, and I think you'll find quite a lot of '9'-sounding albums out there in the charts next year, all of them no doubt hogging the Top 10 spot.\\" \\"Don't Ask Me\\" (single a-side): *John McGeoch (1990/91): \\"Lydon loved 'Don't Ask Me'. Allan wrote the music, but when we put the guitars on it, he thought it sounded almost like a Pistols song or something.\\" \\"The producer had a lovely collection of guitars so I just let him dictate which ones I used. We ended up doing straightforward rhythm on a Les Paul, double-tracking that on the Carvin and then putting some Prince-type dry rhythm guitar over the top on an early '50s Telecaster with about a three-figure serial number.\\" *John Lydon (1990/92): \\"It wasn't my idea to do a Greatest Hits, it was the record company's.

Also of note is the fact that Lia Vissi, Vissi's older sister, made an appearance as one of the backing singers, having done the same one year before. Both sisters would go on (at the 1982 Contest in Anna's case and the 1985 Contest in Lia's) to represent their country of birth, Cyprus.

It is intermediate in size between the Himalayan wolf and the Arabian wolf, and lacks the former's luxuriant winter coat due to it living in warmer conditions. Within this subspecies, the \\"Indian plains wolf\\" is genetically basal to all other extant Canis lupus apart from the older-lineage Himalayan wolf, with both proposed as separate species. The Indian wolf travels in smaller packs and is less vocal than other variants of the grey wolf, and has a reputation for being cunning. Taxonomy The Indian wolf was first described in 1831 by the British ornithologist William Henry Sykes under the binomial Canis pallipes. In 1941, Reginald Pocock subordinated it to Canis lupus under the trinomial Canis lupus pallipes.Pocock, R. I. (1941), Fauna of British India: Mammals volume 2, Taylor & Francis, pp. 82-94 Admixture with other Canis species In 2018, whole genome sequencing was used to compare members of the genus Canis. The study found evidence of gene flow between African golden wolves, golden jackals, and grey wolves (from Saudi Arabia and Syria). One African golden wolf from the Egyptian Sinai Peninsula showed high admixture with the Middle Eastern grey wolves and dogs, highlighting the role of the land bridge between the African and Eurasian continents in canid evolution. The African golden wolf was found to be the descendant of a genetically admixed canid of 72% grey wolf and 28% Ethiopian wolf ancestry. Canis indica The Indian plains wolf (Canis lupus pallipes, synonym Canis indica) is formed by 2 closely related female lineage mitochondrial DNA (mDNA) haplotypes that fall within the Canis lupus pallipes subspecies of the gray wolf. It is only found in the arid and semi-arid peninsular plains of India. These lineages are genetically unique from all other wolves worldwide, including from other wolves forming C. l. pallipes. The Indian gray wolf and the Himalayan wolf are phylogenetically basal to all other wolves and are closer to the African golden wolf. This indicates that these are the descendants of an ancient wolf distribution. In April 2009, the Latin binomial Canis indica had been proposed for these 2 haplotypes as a nomenclatural and taxonomic split from Canis lupus as a new species through the Nomenclature Specialist on the CITES Animals Committee. The committee recommended against this proposal but recommended that the name be entered into the species database as a synonym of the name under which it was listed. The proposal was based on one study that relied on only a limited number of museum and zoo samples that may not have been representative of the wild population, and a call for further fieldwork was made. Earlier, two studies had sequenced the mDNA of the Indian gray wolf and found that it is basal to all other extant Canis lupus haplotypes apart from the older-lineage Himalayan wolf. Later studies compared these sequences against worldwide wolf sequences and confirmed this basal position. One study, based on a fossil record, estimated that the divergence between the coyote and the wolf lineages occurred 1 million years ago and with an assumed wolf mutation rate, estimated that the divergence of the Indian gray wolf from the wolf/dog ancestor occurred 400,000 years ago. Another study, which expressed concerns about the earlier study, gave an estimate of 270,000 years ago. The Indian grey wolf is endangered and its population is estimated at 2,000-3,000. It resembles C. l. pallipes in its outer appearance (morphological features) and its social/reproductive behavior, but it is smaller in size. It is genetically distinct from C. l. pallipes. These findings suggest that the Indian gray wolf is not the pallipes found in the Middle East and Central Asia. It was therefore proposed that the Indian gray wolf be reclassified as a separate species Canis indica. In 2016, a study of the mDNA of both modern and ancient wolves indicated that the Indian gray wolf and the Himalayan wolf were genetically basal when compared with all other grey wolves. The taxonomic reference Mammal Species of the World (2005) does not recognize Canis indica, however NCBI/Genbank does list Canis lupus indica. Description and habits Captive Indian wolf in Islamabad Zoo Indian Wolf Pack at Blackbuck National Park, Gujarat, India The Indian wolf is similar in structure to the European wolf, but is smaller, more slightly built, and has shorter fur with little to no underfur.Blanford, W. T. (1888), Fauna of British India: Mammalia, London, Taylor and Francis, pp. 137-40 It is typically around 57‚Äì72 cm (22‚Äì28 in) at shoulder height, with males ranging from 19‚Äì25 kg (42-55 lb) and females 17‚Äì22 kg (37-49 lb) in weight. Its length ranges from 103‚Äì145 cm (41‚Äì57 in) from nose to tail. Like the Arabian wolf, it has short, thin fur in summer, though the hair on the back remains long even in summer, an adaptation thought to be against solar radiation.Harrington, F. H. & Paquet, P. C. (1982). Wolves of the World: Perspectives of Behavior, Ecology, and Conservation. Park Ridge, N.J: Noyes Publications. The fur is generally greyish-red to reddish-white with grey tones. The hairs are grizzled with black, particularly on the back, which sports a dark V-shaped patch around the shoulders. The limbs are paler than the body, and the underparts are almost completely white.Mivart, G. (1890), Dogs, Jackals, Wolves and Foxes: A Monograph of the Canid√¶, London: R.H. Porter : Dulau, pp. 9-10 Pups are born sooty-brown, with a milk-white patch on the chest that fades with age. Black specimens are rare, but have been recorded in India's Solapur district and two regions of Iran. In the latter country, the mutation was found to be naturally occurring, unlike in North American grey wolves, which have inherited the Kb allele responsible for melanism from past interbreeding with dogs. Its habits are similar to those of other grey wolf subspecies, though the Indian wolf generally lives in smaller packs rarely exceeding 6-8 individuals, and is relatively less vocal, having rarely been known to howl. Indian wolf vocalization includes howls, howl- barks, whimper, social squeals, and whines with howls an average fundamental frequency of 422 Hz and whines 906 Hz. There is at least one record of a lone wolf associating with a pair of dholes in Debrigarh Wildlife Sanctuary. It tends to breed from mid-October to late December, and whelp in holes or ravines. It typically preys on antelopes, rodents, and hares. It usually hunts in pairs when targeting antelopes, with one wolf acting as a decoy while the other attacks from behind. The range of the Indian wolf overlaps with the golden jackal, sloth bear, leopard, brown bear, Asiatic lion and tiger. Hunting Indian wolves are nocturnal and hunt from dusk to dawn, using different strategies for their various prey animals. These wolves are said to be exceptional in speed and endurance. An Indian wolf pack will spread themselves out when hunting Indian hares and various rodents, in contrast to coordinating when their target is the swift blackbuck antelope. The blackbuck is the major prey animal for wolves in Nannaj and Blackbuck National Park and constitute up to 88% of Indian wolf biomass consumption. Because the antelope is faster, Indian wolves will usually chase it toward ravines, bushes or hollows, where more wolves wait in ambush. In addition to leading antelopes into an ambush, Indian wolves can chase blackbucks down hills for a short-term burst in speed. Indian wolves may also select a sick or injured animal and separate it from the herd, pursuing it to exhaustion. This strategy is commonly seen in grey wolves, and often proves successful. Finally, when they close the distance and attack, a single wolf would grab the snout to asphyxiate the antelope while others attack the rear. Indian wolves are also reported to use curiosity to lure antelopes in for a kill. One story remarks that a wolf rolled over, legs upright, when the blackbucks were feeding. When the antelope accidentally disturbed this wolf, two others sprung up for the kill. Range and status=West Asia During the 19th century, wolves were widespread in many parts of the Holy Land east and west of the Jordan River. However, they decreased considerably in number between 1964 and 1980, largely due to persecution by farmers.Qumsiyeh, Mazin B. (1996). Mammals of the Holy Land. Texas Tech University Press, pp. 146‚Äì148, Currently, Israel's conservation policies and effective law enforcement maintain a moderately sized wolf population, which radiates into neighbouring countries. Turkey may play an important role in maintaining wolves in the region, due to its contiguity with Central Asia. The mountains of Turkey have served as a refuge for the few wolves remaining in Syria. A small wolf population occurs in the Golan Heights, and is well protected by the military activities there.Mech, L. David; Boitani, Luigi (2003). Wolves: Behaviour, Ecology and Conservation. University of Chicago Press. p. 326-27. . Although Turkish wolves have no legal protection, they may number about 7,000 individuals. Little is known of current wolf populations in Iran, which once occurred throughout the country in low densities during the mid-1970s. Although widespread throughout the country, being absent only in the central desert and Dasht-e Lut, there is no reliable estimation on the wolf's population size there. Wolves in Iran continue to suffer from habitat loss, unregulated hunting and loss of prey. Indian subcontinent Skull Indian Wolf at Velavadar (Blackbuck National Park, Gujarat) The northern regions of Afghanistan and Pakistan are important strongholds for the wolf. It has been estimated that there are about 300 wolves in approximately of Jammu and Kashmir in northern India, and 50 more in Himachal Pradesh. Hindus traditionally considered the hunting of wolves, even dangerous ones, as taboo, for fear of causing a bad harvest. The Santals, however, considered them fair game, as with every other forest-dwelling animal. During British rule in India, wolves were not considered game species, and were killed primarily in response to them attacking game herds, livestock, and people. In 1876, in the North-West Provinces and Bihar State, 2,825 wolves were killed in response to 721 fatal attacks on humans.Knight, John (2004). Wildlife in Asia: Cultural Perspectives. Psychology Press, pp. 219‚Äì221, Two years later, 2,600 wolves were killed in response to attacks leaving 624 humans dead. By the 1920s, wolf extermination remained a priority in the NWP and Awadh. Overall, over 100,000 wolves were killed for bounties in British India between 1871 and 1916. In modern India, the Indian wolf is distributed across the states of Gujarat, Rajasthan, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh. As of 2004, it is estimated that there are around 2000‚Äì3000 Indian wolves in the country. They are mainly found outside of protected reserves and feed mainly on domestic animals, such as goats or sheep. However, in areas where natural prey is still abundant, for example in Velavadar National Park or Panna Tiger Reserve, natural prey species are still preferred. Although protected since 1972, Indian wolves are classed as Endangered, with many populations lingering in low numbers or living in areas increasingly used by humans. Although present in Bhutan, there is no information on the wolves occurring there. Relationships with humans=Attacks on humans Indian wolves have a history of preying on children, a phenomenon called \\"child-lifting\\". In 1878, 624 people were killed by wolves in Uttar Pradesh, and 14 others were killed in Bengal. In 1900, 285 people were killed in the Central Provinces.Burton, R.G. (1991). A Book of Man Eaters. Mittal Publications. Between 1910 and 1915, 115 children were killed by wolves in Hazaribagh, and 122 were killed in the same area in 1980‚Äì1986. In Jaunpur, Pratapgarh and Sultanpur in Uttar Pradesh, wolves killed 21 children and mauled 16 others from March 27, 1996 to July 1, 1996. Between April 1993 and April 1995, five wolf packs attacked 80 children, 20 of whom were rescued, in Hazaribagh, West Koderma and Latehar Forest Divisions. The children were taken primarily in the summer period in the evening hours, and often within human settlements. In Iran, wolf attacks have been reported for millennia. As with India, many cases of wolves making off with small children have been reported. Adults have been attacked on occasion, including an incident in which a policeman was killed and partially eaten by three wolves after dismounting from his horse to relieve himself. On January 2, 2005 in the village of Vali Asr, near the town of Torbat Heydariya, northeastern Iran, a wolf pack attacked a homeless man in front of witnesses. Although the police intervened, the man died of his wounds.Homeless man eaten by wolves in Iran. Iranfocus (2005-01-04) In early November 2008, a media report claimed that a wolf had attacked an 87-year-old woman in the village cemetery of Kashan in central Iran, biting off one of her fingers, but was suffocated to death when she fought back.Wolf slain by 87-year-old Iranian woman . presstv.ir (2008-11-08). A miniature, depicting a wolf hunt in ancient Persia Predation on Livestock Indian wolves will feed on livestock when natural prey is scarce. This causes human-wolf conflicts and wolf persecution since human population density is high in these areas. Grass is quickly grazed by livestock in unprotected grasslands that cannot sustain a blackbuck population afterward. Among domestic animals, goats are the primary target for Indian wolves, comprising 66% of wolf attacks around the Jhelum district, with sheep following at 27%. Wolves are also more prone to preying on livestock during denning periods and with pups below 5‚Äì6 months old. It is not uncommon for locals to exaggerate the magnitude of Indian wolf depredation and tell tales of their predatory wiles, contributing to hatred of the animal. In culture Like the fox and the coyote, the Indian wolf has a reputation for being clever. There are many stories of their stratagems told by locals, observers and shepherds. The people of Maharashtra would sing labad landga dhong kartay, which translates to \\"Wolves are clever animals and will fool you with their devilish methods.\\" Wolves are occasionally mentioned in Hindu mythology. In the Harivamsa, Krishna, to convince the people of Vraja to migrate to Vrindavan, creates hundreds of wolves from his hairs, which frighten the inhabitants of Vraja into making the journey.Wilson, H. H., Hall, F. (1868). The Vish≈Ñu Pur√°≈Ña: A System of Hindu Mythology and Tradition. Trubner In the Rig Veda, Rijrsava is blinded by his father as punishment for having given 101 of his family's sheep to a she-wolf, who in turn prays to the Ashvins to restore his sight. Bhima, the voracious son of the god Vayu, is described as Vrikodara, meaning \\"wolf-stomached\\". The wolf has an ambivalent reputation in Iranian culture, being demonised in the Avestas as a creation of Ahriman,Krishna Murthy, K. (1985). Mythical animals in Indian art. Abhinav Publications, and still features in contemporary cautionary tales told to misbehaving children.Humphreys, P. & Kahrom, E. (1999). Lion and Gazelle: The Mammals and Birds of Iran. I.B.Tauris. pp. 88-9. Indian wolves take a central role in Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book series, in which a pack in the Seoni area of Madhya Pradesh adopts the feral child Mowgli, and teaches him how to survive in the jungle whilst protecting him from the Bengal tiger Shere Khan and the marauding dhole.

The tops of the gametophytes (3) can be discerned as well. Inset shows the surrounding, black poplars growing on sandy loam on the bank of a kolk, with the detail area marked. Ecological thinning is a silvicultural technique used in forest management that involves cutting trees to improve functions of a forest other than timber production. Although thinning originated as a man- made forest management tool, aimed at increasing timber yields, the shift from production forests to multifunctional forests brought with it the cutting of trees to manipulate an ecosystem for various reasons, ranging from removing non-native species from a plot to removing poplars growing on a riverside beach aimed at recreational use. Since the 1970s, leaving the thinned trees on the forest floor has become an increasingly common policy: wood can be decomposed in a more natural fashion, playing an important role in increasing biodiversity by providing habitat to various invertebrates, birds and small mammals. Many fungi (e.g. Calocera viscosa) and mosses are saproxylic or epixylic as well (e.g. Marchantiophyta) ‚Äì some moss species completing their entire life-cycle on a single log. Where trees are managed under a commercial regime, competition is reduced by removing adjacent stems that exhibit less favourable timber quality potential. When left in a natural state trees will \\"self-thin\\", but this process can be unreliable in some circumstances. Examples of this can be found in the Buxus ‚Äì Ironbark forests and woodlands of Victoria (Australia) where a large proportion of trees are coppice, resultant from timber cutting in decades gone by. Ecophysiological repercussions Thinning decreases canopy closure and increases the penetration of solar radiation into the canopy. The photosynthetic efficiency of this energy is improved, and needle retention is prolonged, especially in the lower parts of the crown. The root system, crown length, crown diameter, and crown area all increase after thinning.Misson, L.; Vincke, C.; Devillez, F. 2003. Frequency responses of radial growth series after different thinning intensities in Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.) stands. For. Ecol. Manage. 177(1‚Äì3):51‚Äì63. Even if soil evaporation and individual tree transpiration increases after thinning, total evapo-transpiration at stand level tends to decrease;Whitehead, D.; Jarvis, P.G.; Waring, R.H. 1984. Stomatal conductance, transpiration, and resistance to water uptake in a Pinus sylvestris spacing experiment. Can. J. For. Res. 14:692‚Äì700. canopy water interception is reduced and throughfall increased, so that tree-water status usually improves after thinning. Radial annual growth is an integrative index of tree physiological response to environmental variation. Working with Norway spruce, which can be expected to behave in some respects similarly to white spruce, Misson et al. showed that a reduction in stand density alters the classical climate‚Äìgrowth relationship. At individual tree level, thinning could be used to increase tree resistance to drought stress. Nevertheless, this effect is limited when site conditions are limiting. Misson et al. concluded that heavy thinning should be applied when forest decline is expected from drought stress. Furthermore, stands on dry sites should be thinned more heavily because such sites cannot support high-density stands. Aussenac,Aussenac, G. 1987. Effets de l'√©claircie sur l'√©cophysiologie des peuplements forestiers. Schweiz. Z. Forst. 138:685‚Äì700. also working with Norway spruce, investigated the response to thinning. Thinning altered the temporal evolution of radial growth at all frequencies in radial growth chronologies. Previous studies had shown, not surprisingly, that thinning decreases the canopy closure and encourages solar radiation to penetrate the canopy.Habonimana, B. 2000.

These modifications at the crown level influence photosynthate production positively as long as water supply is not limiting. Even if soil evaporation and individual tree transpiration are more important after thinning, total evapo-transpiration at stand level tends to decrease.Morikawa, Y.; Hattori, S.; Kiyono, Y. 1986. Transpiration of a 3-year-old Chamaecyparis obtusa Endl. stand before and after thinning. Tree Physiol. 2:105‚Äì114. Furthermore, with the reduced importance of leaf area index (LAI), thinning reduces canopy water interception and increases throughfall.Fran√ßois, F.; Mertens, P.; Andr√©, P.; Devillez, F. 1984.

Thus, during the vegetation period, tree- water status is usually better in a thinned stand than in a high-density stand.Ginn, S.E.; Seiler, J.R.; Cazell, B.H.; Kreh, R.E. 1991. Physiological and growth responses of eight-year-old loblolly pine stands to thinning. For.

Growth and water relations of Eucalyptus marginata (jarrah) stands in response to thinning and fertilisation. Tree Physiol. 16:267‚Äì274. For semi-tolerant species such as Norway spruce and white spruce, solar energy is less limiting than for intolerant species. This can account for the exponential relationship found by Misson et al. between thinning intensity and mean radial growth. Only when thinning was relatively severe did important radial growth variation occur. Furthermore, the ecophysiological advantage of an improved water supply could be counterbalanced by limiting site conditions. For Norway spruce in the Belgian Ardennes, Misson et al. recommended that stand basal area should not exceed 26 m¬≤/ha on a dry site, or 29 m¬≤/ha on a moist site if the objective is to maintain high long-term radial growth. Misson et al. found that adaptations to thinning cover a continuous range of different time scales, with long-, medium-, and short-term growth variations being controlled by very different internal factors influenced by the environment. Misson et al. ascribed what they called long- and medium-term radial growth variation of individual trees mainly to structural adaptation, such as enlargement of the crown or the root system. Short-term radial growth variations, on the other hand, were considered to be due mainly to physiological acclimatisation, with response to factors such as stomatal conductance regulation, variation of photosynthetic capacity, and respiration. Nevertheless, it is clear that the adaptations are linked, and that radial growth is the integrative response of this mutual inter-relationship.Kahle, H.P.; Spiecker, H. 1996.

Research  Research programs under way in various parts of the world (e.g. United States and Australia) are aimed at providing an alternate approach in forest management where conservation objectives are a high priority. Methods of ecological thinning being developed on silvicultural techniques for local forest types. Ecological thinning is being developed using two principles: 1. appropriate stem reduction to reduce competition and 2. retention of trees (selection) that are more suitable for wildlife (i.e. not timber production). An example of ecological thinning research is the project in Victoria's Box- Ironbark forests, investigating various thinning and timber removal methods under an adaptive management or AEM framework. The primary objective is to generate (over time) a number of forest habitat values (i.e. tree hollows) that are crucial for wildlife conservation.

It breeds in lowlands from southeastern Mexico to northern Bolivia, north-central Brazil and the Guianas. This flycatcher ranges east of the Andes cordillera into the entire Amazon Basin of northern Brazil and the Guianas; to the west of the Andes in Colombia and Ecuador into Central America. It is the only member of the genus Terenotriccus, but some authorities place it in genus Myiobius. However, it differs in voice, behaviour, and structure from members of that group. This tiny flycatcher breeds from sea level to altitude, locally to , in wet mountain forests and in adjacent tall second growth. The nest is a pear-shaped pouch of plant fibres and leaves with a visored side entrance, built by the female 2‚Äì6 m high in the undergrowth and suspended from a twig or vine. The two chocolate-blotched white eggs are incubated by the female for 15‚Äì16 days to hatching, the male playing no part in the care of the eggs or young. The ruddy-tailed flycatcher is long and weighs . The upperparts are grey-olive, with a rufous rump, tail, wings and eye ring. The throat is buff and the breast is cinnamon, becoming pale buff on the belly. Sexes are similar, but young birds are brighter above and have a browner tail and breast. The ruddy-tailed flycatcher is mainly solitary, and only occasionally joins mixed-species feeding flocks. It feeds on insects, especially leafhoppers, picked from foliage or taken in acrobatic aerial pursuit. This species has a see-oo see call, and a repetitive eek eek eek eek eek song. It sometimes flicks both wings up to make a faint whirring sound.

Meanie (a.k.a. Dennis DePianto) on lead guitar, Link Meanie (a.k.a. Lindsay McLennan) on vocals and guitar, Ringo Meanie (a.k.a. Mark Hobbs) on drums, and VB Meanie (a.k.a. Dave Christopher) on bass guitar and vocals. As from September 2015 the line-up is Link, Ringo and Wally Meanie (a.k.a. Roderick Kempton) on bass guitar and backing vocals. The Meanies had a hiatus from 1996 to 1998. The band provides energetic performances, with Link injured on stage on several occasions. The group have issued three studio albums, Come 'n' See (March 1992), 10% Weird (August 1994) and It's Not Me It's You (September 2015). Founding member (from 1988 to 1995), D.D. Meanie (Dennis DePianto), died in February 2008 after being diagnosed with cancer. Their guitarist from 1993 onwards, Tasman \\"Tas\\" Blizzard, died in August 2008 in a car accident. History The Meanies formed in Melbourne in 1988 as a punky power pop group by D.D. Meanie (a.k.a. Dennis DePianto) on lead guitar, Link Meanie (a.k.a. Lindsay McLennan) on vocals and guitar, Ringo Meanie (a.k.a. Mark Hobbs) on drums, and VB Meanie (a.k.a. Dave Christopher) on bass guitar and vocals. According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, they \\"were the undisputed kings of the inner-city/all-ages circuit. The band's frantic, Ramones-inspired power pop and hyperactive live shows drew capacity audiences of alacritous fans. The Meanies were also one of the most productive independent recording bands of the day.\\" Chris Johnston of Rolling Stone opined that their songs, \\"will all be short, between two and three minutes every time. Each burst of savage punk/pop noise will also be a potential anthem; an unclean riff with a beating heart of pure melody.\\" Frenzal Rhomb cited them as one of their five influential bands. During 1989 VB Meanie (Dave Christopher) was replaced on bass guitar by Kinky Meanie (later \\"Wally\\" Meanie, a.k.a. Roderick Kempton). Christopher moved to Adelaide where he founded Free Moving Curtis as Dave Plague. In the early 1990s, the Meanies performed primarily in their hometown, where they contacted local label owner, Bruce Milne, of Au Go Go Records, which issued three tracks, \\"Big Bertha\\", \\"Mr Authority\\" and \\"Our New Planet\\", on a Various Artists' split extended play, Boogie Wonderland (April 1990), with three tracks each by tour mates, the Throwaways, and Nice Girls from Cincinnati. McFarlane felt, \\"the Meanies weighed in with the best track, the short, sharp and very catchy 'Our New Planet'.\\" Kempton remembered how the split EP came about, \\"We never even thought of taking anything to a major label. Even that EP we recorded, Dave Kendall from the Throwaways suggested we put out a split 7\\", with us... He investigated how much it would cost to get the record pressed... it was going to cost this much for a 7\\", and only this much more for a 12\\", so why don't we do a few songs each. Dave just happened to have it on him one day when he went shopping in Au-Go-Go and got talking to Bruce [Milne] behind the counter, and Bruce said 'yeah, I've heard of those bands' and he asked to listen to it. And it was pretty much the same day when Bruce rang up and offered to put it out.\\" A Various Artists' split album, Oh God Part 3 / How 'Bout It Baby, followed in September 1990, which included three more tracks by the Meanies, \\"Macho Wankers\\", \\"Mantra\\" and \\"Fade In, Fade Out\\", as well as additional material from Bored!, Nice Girls from Cincinnati, and the Dirty Lovers. From November 1990 to March 1991 they released a run of EPs and singles, as limited edition 7\\" vinyl discs. Most of their material was written by Lindsay \\"Link Meanie\\" McLennan. They toured Australia, including appearances at Big Day Out festivals in 1992, 1993 and 1994. They supported local gigs by international artists from 1992, Nirvana, The Lemonheads, Pop Will Eat Itself, Redd Kross, Beastie Boys, Pearl Jam and Bad Brains. Their debut studio album, Come 'n' See, appeared in April 1992, which was produced by Michael 'Ded' Kennedy and the Meanies. A PBS reviewer, described how they \\"had established themselves as one of Australia's pre-eminent underground rock bands through cultivating a huge all-age following and upsetting the rock establishment by breaking attendance records in the nation's capital cities.\\" They supported a tour of Australia by the 5.6.7.8's, a Japanese rock trio, in August 1991 and followed them to Japan in next month. This led to a local label, Time Bomb Records, issuing their material into that market and further support slots backing Jackie & the Cedrics, Concrete Octopus, Blow One's Cool, and Rise from the Dead. In January 1993 Tasman \\"Tas\\" Blizzard joined on lead guitar (ex-Seaweed Goorillas). The Meanies toured Europe and the United States in late 1993. While in the US they travelled to Seattle to record their second studio album, 10% Weird (August 1994), with Conrad Uno producing. Blizzard had left the group earlier in January of that year to return to Seaweed Goorillas but he rejoined the Meanies in mid-1995. The group went into hiatus in January 1996 with members undertaking individual projects and reformed in September 1998. In 2006 they released a DVD, The Meanies: A Seminal Australian Punk Tale, which features a documentary, Sorry 'bout the Violence, 11 music videos and a live concert filmed in 1994. They toured the Australian east coast in August‚ÄìSeptember 2006. In 2008 the Meanies promoted a series of 7\\" singles featuring previously unreleased tracks and cover versions of the Meanies' tracks performed by Cockfight Shootout, Digger and the Pussycats, The Drones, Dan Kelly and You Am I. Kempton told Emery of Beat Magazine, \\"The way we chose the bands was me finding out bands who loved the Meanies when they were younger... So Augie March are going to do a song because Glenn Richards was a Meanies fan when he was younger. Angie Hart is going to do a song because she used to come and see us, plus You Am I, Digger and the Pussycats, Double Agents, Snout, and we keep asking the Spazzys, but they still haven't got around to it.\\" On 14 February 2008 original member Dennis DePianto (D.D. Meanie), died at St. Vincents Hospital, Melbourne. Alt URL He had been diagnosed with muscular dystrophy as a child, and towards the end of his life he contracted cancer. He was in the Meanies from their inception until 1995. Guitarist, Tasman \\"Tas\\" Blizzard died on 1 August 2008, as a result of a car accident. His car had lost control in wet conditions along the Bellarine Peninsula and spun into a dam alongside the road. It was almost completely submerged ‚Äì Blizzard was the only person in the car. First responder, Alistair Drayton of Mannerim CFA, swam into the murky water, but \\"discovered the victim deceased, still trapped in the driver's seat.\\" The band added Jaws Meanie (a.k.a. Jordan Stanley) on guitar and continued as a four-piece ‚Äì his first two gigs were tribute shows for DePianto and Blizzard, respectively. Rolling Stones Ryan Saar found, \\"[they] are surely one of Australia's favourite treasures. Stumbling upon their brand of grotesque power-pop is a venerable goldmine for any music fan seeking the loud and thrilling.

Along with Nick Reynolds and Bob Shane, he was one of the founding members of The Kingston Trio. Guard was born in San Francisco and went to Punahou School in Honolulu in what was then the pre-statehood U.S. Territory of Hawaii. Upon completion of his final year of high school in 1952 at Menlo School, a private prep school in Menlo Park, California, he matriculated at nearby Stanford University, graduating in 1957 with a degree in economics. While an undergraduate at Stanford, Guard started a pickup group with Reynolds and Shane. Guard called his group Dave Guard and the Calypsonians, with a Weavers-style signature sound that was principally two guitars, a banjo, and rollicking vocals. Guard kept the group together after Reynolds and Shane left, changing the name of the Calypsonians to The Kingston Quartet. Then in 1957, when Reynolds and Shane agreed to team up with Guard again, the group changed its name to The Kingston Trio. Under contract with Capitol Records, the Trio became a huge commercial and influential success. Early life Guard spent his early years first in San Francisco, and then his junior high school and high school years in Honolulu, Territory of Hawaii. Guard grew up hearing the soft vocal melodies and strummed guitars of Hawaiian music. He was particularly attracted to the unique rhythmic sounds of finger-picked slack-key ukulele and guitar music masterfully performed by the many of his neighbors and beach boys. Guard attended Punahou School, a private school established in 1849 by Hawaii's New England missionary families during junior high school and high school. Hawaiian culture and music played an important part in his school's educational program. Along with all his other classmates, Guard early on learned to play Hawaii's ubiquitous ukulele in a 7th grade junior high school music class required of all students. It was in that class that Punahou's young 7th graders like Guard and his future Kingston Trio partner-to-be Shane learned the basics of playing the ukulele. The \\"ukulele\\" class made an impact on Shane, who during the next four years progressed steadily from the 4-string ukulele to the less toy-like and more professional-appearing baritone uke, on to the tenor guitar, and finally to the 6-string acoustic guitar. According to Guard, his own first serious exposure to stringed instruments came from Shane, who taught him the rudiments of playing the six-string guitar. Guard participated in sports, and was a member of Punahou's ROTC battalion. In his junior year he participated in musical skits along with a number of other classmates who, like himself, had by that time also had become accomplished musicians. Guard left Punahou at the end of his junior year, completing his final year of high school at the Menlo School, a private prep school that helped him prepare for acceptance and matriculation at nearby Stanford University. At Stanford Guard was a member of the Beta Chi chapter of Sigma Nu fraternity. Professional life and accomplishments (1955‚Äì61) When Shane left the Calypsonians and returned to Hawaii to work in his family's business, Guard added two members, bassist Joe Gannon and vocalist Barbara Bogue, making the Calypsonians a quartet. Later, when Reynolds also left the Calypsonians, Guard replaced him with Don MacArthur to keep the quartet format intact, but by that time the national interest in calypso rhythms was waning, while Guard's musical growth was reaching out from calypso as well. Still appreciating Caribbean rhythms and vocals, but given his more eclectic folk music interests, Guard changed the name of the four Calypsonians to The Kingston Quartet. The Kingston Trio In 1956 a publicist in the area, Frank Werber, offered his services to Guard and his bandmates, including Reynolds at the time. Werber's offer, however, was contingent upon replacing Gannon and Bogue, and shortly thereafter both left the group. Guard and Reynolds contacted former Calypsonian member Shane (who was performing part- time in Honolulu) asking him to join the reconstituted group. In 1957, back again as a trio as in their previous college days, they changed its name to The Kingston Trio. With material gathered from a variety of sources, under Guard's musical arrangements and direction, the Kingston Trio quickly became a success. Guard, Shane, and Reynolds worked well together. In addition to developing the characteristic \\"Kingston Trio sound\\" of the group's two guitars and a banjo, success came to the group from Guard's musical arrangements and renditions of folk and Irish ballads, Shane's talent for style and performance along with an innate knowledge of what pleased audiences, and Reynolds's management of the group's logistics. The Kingston Trio with Guard recorded for Capitol Records; subsequent iterations of the group managed first by Werber and Shane and later by Shane alone recorded for Decca Records, Folk Era, Silverwolf, Pair, Collector's Choice Music, CEMA, and MCA, and had many hit songs in its initial 10-year run. The Kingston Trio's many songs include \\"Tom Dooley\\", \\"A Worried Man\\", \\"Hard Travelin'\\", \\"The Tijuana Jail\\", \\"Greenback Dollar\\", \\"Reverend Mr. Black\\", \\"Sloop John B\\", \\"Scotch and Soda\\", \\"Merry Minuet\\", \\"Hard, Ain't It Hard\\", \\"Zombie Jamboree\\", \\"M.T.A.\\", \\"Three Jolly Coachmen\\", and \\"Raspberries, Strawberries\\". Guard's break with the Trio Guard was aware that among the Kingston Trio, he was the only one who could read music and who had some understanding of music theory; his partners basically played by rote, and the three of them sang in simple three-part harmony. With help from the Trio's bassist and musicologist David \\"Buck\\" Wheat, Guard embarked on a self-education program of learning more about harmony, becoming more and more disenchanted with what appeared to him to be a lack of willingness or effort to \\"improve\\" on the part of his partners. By late 1960 Guard's frustration and discontent with his partners, combined with an alleged embezzlement of the group's finances, had reached a point where he no longer wanted to work with Reynolds and Shane. Giving his partners notice that he intended to leave the Trio, and unwilling to cause the group he had founded to disband, Guard agreed to stay on with the Trio until his personal commitments were completed and until Shane and Reynolds were able to find a suitable replacement for him. By early 1961 Shane and Reynolds had found a replacement. After a reportedly acrimonious meeting with Shane, Reynolds, and the Trio's business manager over the future of the Trio, Guard quit the group. The group continued to perform for six years as the Kingston Trio before disbanding in 1967, with John Stewart taking Guard's place. Post 'Trio' accomplishments (1961‚Äì78)=The Whiskeyhill Singers In 1961, shortly after leaving the Trio, Guard formed a new group, The Whiskeyhill Singers, with Judy Henske, Cyrus Faryar, and Kingston Trio bassist David \\"Buck\\" Wheat. They toured and released an album and were asked to perform several folk songs on the Academy Award-winning soundtrack of How the West Was Won. Their voices can be heard on \\"The Erie Canal,\\" \\"900 miles,\\" \\"The Ox Driver,\\" and \\"Raise A Ruckus Tonight\\". Cyrus Faryar can be heard performing solo on the track \\"Wanderin'\\" and Dave Guard on \\"Poor Wayfarin' Stranger\\". Judy Henske featured solo on \\"Careless Love\\". Judy Henske was eventually replaced by Liz Seneff, but the Whiskeyhill Singers were disbanded in late 1962 after Guard left for Australia. Dave Guard and The Whiskeyhill Singers recorded their first album at Henry Jacobs' studio at Sausalito, and it was released on the Capitol record label. A second album was recorded at the same private studio, but it was never released. The soundtrack to How the West Was Won was the group's final recorded appearance to be released commercially. Dave's Place In late 1962 Guard moved with his family to Sydney, Australia, where he purchased a home overlooking the South Pacific Ocean at Whale Beach. He performed both under his own name, anonymously and under an alias as a supporting musician and vocalist on Australian recording sessions with, among others, Lionel Long, The Twiliters, The Green Hill Singers, Tina Date and The Tolmen. He also anonymously recorded many sound clips for radio and TV commercials. In 1964, Guard became the folk music consultant on the ABC-TV program Jazz Meets Folk, and he hosted his own ABC-TV national variety show, Dave's Place, on Sunday nights for 13 weeks in late 1965. Four episodes of Dave's Place featured Judy Henske as a guest performer. Until his return to the United States in 1968, Guard gave guitar lessons and, with the help of his wife, Gretchen, wrote a book, Colour Guitar, describing a unique guitar teaching method relating music theory to a 12-valued chain of chords with color.Mildred Hamilton, San Francisco Sunday Examiner and Chronicle, February 19, 1978 Guard's relationship with the Trio remained strained while he was in Australia. According to Guard, while he was in Australia, he was never in contact with Reynolds and Shane, and he never heard any of their albums.Popular Folk Music Today, Spring 1991 as reprinted in The Kingston Trio on Record Following his return from Australia in 1968 and his wife's 1970 graduation from Stanford with a degree in art, Guard and his wife collaborated in researching, writing, and publishing a book on the ancient Irish folk tale, Deirdre of the Sorrows, followed by a second book about a 400-year-old Hawaiian folk tale. Pure Gabby After the breakup of the Singers in 1961, Guard had returned to Hawaii. Always a folk music eclectic, Guard attempted to publicize the slack- key sounds of Hawaiian folk guitar. Guard worked closely in Honolulu with slack-key guitar icon Gabby Pahinui to record and produce Pure Gabby, an album of classic Hawaiian melodies played with slack key tunings. Guard tried to interest major record companies with Pure Gabby, but met with little interest, and he shelved the project. In 1978, ten years after his return from Australia, at the urging of Singer colleague, Cyrus Faryar, who had heard Guard's Pure Gabby tapes, Guard contacted Hula Records of Honolulu about Pure Gabby, which agreed to take the recordings and distribute the album.Pure Gabby liner notes with a note from the producer on how this record came to be. Later years In 1981, Guard reunited with Shane and Reynolds for a PBS fundraising concert and program entitled \\"The Kingston Trio and Friends Reunion\\". He also made occasional concert appearances with John Stewart, his replacement in the Trio who was by then a respected and successful solo performer. In addition to writing and recording, Guard also found time to produce the video Workout for Equestrians with Ingrid Gsottschneider for Golden Arrow Enterprises.Bruce Eder, How The West Was Won (soundtrack) liner notes. In the 1970s, Dave Guard recorded a live album at The Ice House in Pasadena. His backing group on this album was The Modern Folk Quartet, which included former Whiskeyhill Singer Cyrus Faryar. The album was turned down by Capitol and was never released. During the 1980s Guard continued to perform as a soloist and teach music. He did four tracks on a 12-track cassette recorded to accompany the \\"All Along the Merrimac\\" tour of New Hampshire and a final solo album, Up & In (1988), which received mixed reviews. One interesting aspect of both of the last two releases was Guard's performance of the Kingston Trio standard \\"Scotch and Soda,\\" which he had arranged in 1956 but which for thirty years had been performed in The Trio only by Bob Shane. Over the years following his return to the US, Guard worked with a number of people, including Alex Hassilev, Mike Settle, Judy Henske, Cyrus Faryar, Tim Buckley, Tommy Makem and David White. Dave Guard remarried during this time, and lived with his wife in Los Altos, California. Death Guard developed lymphoma sometime after he moved to Rollinsford, New Hampshire. In Rollinsford, he had been taken in by The Shaw Brothers, since he was destitute and without insurance. They were twin brothers Ron and Rick Shaw who were folk singers in their own right. On March 22, 1991, aged 56, he succumbed to the cancer. His memorial service in Portsmouth, New Hampshire was attended by Bob Shane, Glen Yarbrough, the Limeliters and many other figures from the folk world. He was survived by his mother Majorie, former wife Gretchen, and their three children (Sally, Catherine, and Tom). Guard's daughter Sally died in 2001, also from cancer.Punahou School class of 1952 50th reunion classmate biographies Discography=Dave Guard & The Calypsonians * Run Joe 1957 (Capitol) * Fast Freight 1957 (Capitol) The Kingston Trio * The Kingston Trio 1958 (Capitol) * ...from the Hungry i 1959 (Capitol) * Stereo Concert 1959 (Capitol) * At Large 1959 (Capitol) * Here We Go Again! 1959 (Capitol) * Sold Out 1960 (Capitol) * String Along 1960 (Capitol) * The Last Month of the Year 1960 (Capitol) * The Kingston Trio Sings for 7-UP 1960 (TV commercial) * Make Way 1961 (Capitol) * Goin' Places 1961 (Capitol) * Live At Newport 1994 (Capitol) * The Kingston Trio and Friends Reunion 1994 (DVD) * The Capitol Years 1995 (Capitol) * The Capitol Collector Series 1998 (Capitol) * The Best of Kingston Trio Vol 1-3 (Capitol) * The Kingston Trio: The Guard Years 1997 (Bear Family) Top 40 hit singles *Tom Dooley 1958 (Capitol) #1 Gold hit record *The Tijuana Jail 1959 (Capitol) #12 *M.T.A. 1959 (Capitol) #15 *A Worried Man 1959 (Capitol) #20 *El Matador 1960 (Capitol) #32 *Bad Man Blunder 1960 (Capitol) #37 The Whiskeyhill Singers *Dave Guard & The Whiskeyhill Singers 1962 (Capitol) *Whiskeyhill Singers 2nd Album (unreleased) (1962) *How The West Was Won: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack 1963 (MGM) *The Kingston Trio Capitol Years 1995 (Capitol) Dave's Place Group *Dave's Place 1965 (ABC-TV Australia).

The club describes itself as \\"the home of the Sydney Roosters\\". Since its establishment it has progressed on to become one of the larger leagues clubs in comparison to others supporting teams in the National Rugby League competition. The primary clubhouse of the Easts Group, is located at Bondi Junction in Sydney's east, operating on the same site continuously since 1967. The Easts Group also owns licensed premises at Waverley and Kingswood in Sydney, Berkeley in the Illawarra, and Woy Woy on the Central Coast of NSW. Furthermore, the club is planning to build a new licensed club, hotel and sports complex in Sydney's south-west. Establishment and history By the late 1950s, most Sydney Rugby League (now National Rugby League) clubs had established licensed premises to provide revenues to support the operations of their parent Rugby League team. The one remaining exception to this was the foundation Eastern Suburbs District Rugby League Football Club, now known as the Sydney Roosters. In around 1960, Millers Breweries, then one of the largest brewers in Australia, approached the Easts club with a plan to underwrite the operations of a licensed premises in Sydney's east. The football club acquiesced to this suggestion and in 1961, Eastern Suburbs Leagues Club Limited was established, first operating out of a building on the Bondi Beach promenade. Due to the success of the new Easts Leagues Club, the organisation quickly outgrew its beachside location, and with Millers, looked to acquire a site in the booming commercial district of Bondi Junction in the adjacent suburb. The Junction, as it is known, was conveniently located on the then Sydney tramlines (and later the Eastern Suburbs Railway) and was halfway between the team's beachside and inner-eastern suburbs heartlands. Millers Breweries believed the Bondi Junction location would be perfect for a Rugby League and hospitality venue, and the football club believed the location would be convenient for post-match functions after home games at the old Sydney Sports Ground. Easts and Millers originally purchased a building located between Spring Street and Oxford Street in Bondi Junction. Notwithstanding this purchase, the club had grander plans for a larger clubhouse. As such, while operating from its successful new premises, Easts purchased the site of the old Bondi Junction ice-skating rink on the opposite side of Spring Street, as well as adjoining premises on Bronte Road in the Junction. The plan, which came to fruition in 1967, was for Easts to move to the larger side fronting two of the Junction's main streets. Easts have operated from the new site since then, as a hospitality and clubhouse venue, and subsequently built a large commercial tower above the Leagues Club premises. Since the late 1990s, the expanded 'Easts Group' has acquired additional clubhouses by amalgamating with former lawn bowls and other Rugby League clubs, with Easts retaining control of the merged entities. Facilities The Easts Group of clubs provide a range of high-quality, modern facilities including hospitality, such as bars, bistros and restaurants, gymnasiums, lawn bowls fields, gaming and racing areas, corporate and personal function rooms, a swimming pool at the Bondi Junction club, and areas reserved for Sydney Roosters football team post-match supporter functions. Team merchandise is also available at some of the clubs. Not only does the Easts Group continue to support the Sydney Roosters and provide a house facility for members and their guests, Easts has expanded into other areas of interest including: * Easts Property * Easts Accommodation * Easts Training * Kingswood Sports Club, Western Sydney * Berkeley Sports Club, Illawarra region * Easts Sports Club, Macarthur region (under development) * Waverley Bowling Club, Eastern Sydney * Woy Woy Leagues Club, Central Coast region See also *List of pubs in Australia *List of restaurant in Australia ReferencesExternal links * Sydney Roosters Drinking establishments in Australia Restaurants in New South Wales 1961 establishments in Australia Licensed clubs in New South Wales ","title":"Eastern Suburbs Leagues Club"},{"id":"6365911","text":"Gohardasht Prison Gohardasht Prison () is a prison in Gohardasht, a town in the northern outskirt of Karaj, approximately 20 km west of Tehran.

In Google Maps it is listed as \\"Rajai-Shahr Prison, Karaj, Tehran, Iran\\". Political prisoners and prisoners of conscience tend to be sent to Ward 12 of Rajai Shahr. Rajai Shahr is regarded as one of Iran's harshest jails because of its many reported cases of torture, rape and murder. IRGC has solitary confinement cells in Rajai Shahr Prison. In the immediate aftermath of the Islamic Revolution, there were many systematic executions and interrogation of former members of the overthrown monarchy, military. During the 1980s, members of the liberal Marxist and socialist groups (mostly university students) and supporters of The People's Mujahedin of Iran who opposed the theocratic regime were imprisoned and many of them were executed. Mass executions of political prisoners, in particular in Gohardasht and in Evin, took place during the 1988 executions of Iranian political prisoners. Imprisoned student activist Majid Tavakoli was transferred to Gohardasht Prison in August 2010. In June 2012, the organization Campaign to Free Political Prisoners in Iran raised a serious concern with EU Parliament representatives on the situation of political prisoners in Rajaee Shahr: ailing political prisoners are deprived from urgent medical attention, putting their life at risk. On September 13, 2015, Iranian union activist Shahrokh Zamani died while imprisoned here.

A queen bee must mate in order to lay fertilized eggs, which develop into workers and other queens, which are both female. Queens can lay eggs parthenogenetically, but these will always develop into drones (males). Mating nucs A mating yard allows dozens of queens to mate and begin to lay. The hives in a mating yard are primarily mating nucs or drone producing hives. Mating nucs are smaller than normal nucs, often containing non self-sustaining numbers of bees. The beekeeper will replenish the workers in a mating nuc by shaking additional bees into mating nucs when their population is running low. Drone producing hives Drone producing hives produce abnormally large numbers of drones. By using drone foundation in the brood nest a beekeeper can produce a large drone population to saturate the Drone Congregation area with drones of a given stock. Saturating the drone congregation area improves the odds that the queen will mate with drones of a particular lineage, but does not guarantee it. Open mating This method of mating is called \\"open mating.\\" Once a queen is mated and the beekeeper observes the laying pattern, the queen will be removed, caged and sold.

Occupying a total area of , the mixed-use building houses offices, apartments, a hotel, and a fitness center. It is also the sixth-tallest building in Russia, the seventh-tallest in Europe, and the 72nd tallest in the world. Construction of Eurasia started in 2006 and was completed in 2014.  History  The concept of Eurasia was first proposed in 2003. Construction started in 2006 and was completed in 2014.  Design  According to Swanke Hayden Connell Architects, the architectural skin of Eurasia reinforces the purity of the tower volume over the complexity of the program within. The unitized curtain wall allows the transition from the office floors of fixed windows to operable windows on the residential floors. The overall architectural form is developed as a pure glass, curving, curtain wall tower with its broad faces versus its tripartite ends sitting on a multi-volume podium. Eurasia was the first composite structure to be constructed in Russia utilizing a reinforced concrete core with a perimeter frame of steel. The structural design allows for column-free interior spaces ideal for offices which make up a significant portion of the building‚Äôs programming. The building features a bowed exterior made up of closely spaced steel columns which sit upon a belt truss serving as a load transfer for the base of the tower to feature an open lobby on the ground floor.  Features  The building is designed as a two-tier skyscraper: 30 floors in the first tier and 37 in the second one. Offices occupy from the 4th floor to the 45th floor while apartments occupy from the 48th floor to the 66th floor. The 47th floor is occupied by a fitness center and the second floor of the building is occupied by a casino. A swimming pool is located on the 50th floor. Management The building is developed by CJSC Techinvest and MOS City Group. The company LLC Plaza owns Eurasia. On 12 April 2016, VB- service, a subsidiary of VTB Bank, acquired a 99.55% stake in LLC Plaza at a price estimated at 48.5 billion rubles. The transaction was carried out within the framework of the fulfillment of credit obligations by Coulteria to the Bank of Moscow. Head offices of VTB 24 and the Bank of Moscow are planned to occupy the tower.

It is part of the Huajuapan District in the north of the Mixteca Region. It has a population of about 45,321, the sixth-largest community in the state in population. It is located at the intersection of Federal Highways 125 and 190. The name of Huajuapan comes from the Nahuatl words huaxin = huaje, ohtli = road, and apan = river. Literally, River of the huajes. The town was elevated to an honorary Mexican status in June 1843 in remembrance of The siege of Huajuapan, a battle between the royal army and the insurgents led by Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos. The battle was won by the insurgents. The city was named after Antonio de Le√≥n, a hero of the Mexican War of Independence. Geography Huajuapan serves as municipal seat of the Huajuapan municipality, which has an area of 361.06 km¬≤ (139.41 sq mi) and a population of 45,321. It is located in a rugged and mountainous area of Oaxaca, The Mixteca Baja (part of the Mixteca region of Oaxaca), and the climate in this area is dry most of the year. In 1980 it was the worst- affected region of an earthquake which left 300 homeless across Oaxaca. History One of the gravestone found in Tomb 5 of the Cerro de las Minas archeological site The first inhabitants of this area are called the √ëuu Yate (ancient people) who formed their settlement in what is now the town of Huajuapan around 400 BCE. The initial settlement had about 500 to 1500 inhabitants, but as the city grew to its height between 350 and 800 CE it had up to 300,000 people in the valley. The next culture to flourish here was the Mixteca-Puebla culture at about 1200. During this time period, Huajuapan was one of several population centers on the slopes of the Cerro del Sombererito and Cerro de Acatlima, but it was the economic, cultural and ceremonial center of the valley. Sometime shortly after 1521, the Spaniards took control of this region. It is known that Francisco Orozco, along with Augustinians Fray Bernardino Minaya and Fray Gonzales Lucero were the first Spanish to arrive here. However, no Spanish records exist for this region until 1542. Model of Huajuapan during the early colonial period The Spanish town of Huajuapan was founded in 1561 by order of the viceregal authorities in Mexico City. Prior to this the low parts of the valley were not organized and merchants travelling through the area often suffered from highway bandits. Residents of the hill areas around the valley were ordered to move to the valley floor to found the city. The economy here during the colonial period was dominated by haciendas that exploited the native labor of the region. During the Mexican War of Independence, this village was subject to a siege by insurgent forces that lasted 111 days. Resistance of the town was finally broken in June 1812 by Coronel Valerio Trujano, with help from General Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos. After Independence, the village began to grow, becoming a town named Huajuapan de Le√≥n. In 1884, the town was declared a city by then-governor Mariano Jim√©nez. Initially, the city of Huajuapan was the seat of a district under the 1825 Oaxaca state constitution, with the name of Huajuapan-Silacayoapan. In 1844, the state was reorganized into new districts with Huajuapan being one of them. In 1858, it was reorganized again, but Huajuapan remained the seat of a district. Climate Huajuapan de Le√≥n experiences a warm humid subtropical climate (K√∂ppen Cwa). Notable sites Model of a traditional Mixtec village council at the Regional Museum In the center of the city is found the Catedral de Nuestra Se√±ora de Guadalupe (Cathedral of Our Lady of Guadalupe) and the adjacent Capilla del Se√±or de los Corazones (Chapel of Our Lord of the Hearts). The Antonio de Le√≥n central plaza is located next to the cathedral and the municipal palace. Its paths are lined with trees and garden spaces and an octagonal kiosk in the center. Near the town are the Cerros de las Minas, an archeological site and Las Campanas, which are calcite rocks from which drip water from a small stream. There is also the Museo Regional de Huajuapan (Regional Museum of Huajuapan) that specialized in the Mixtec cultures of this area. Cerro de las Minas The hill now known as the Cerro de las Minas, which dominates the valley of Huajuapan, was the site of an ancient Mixtec community. The site lies in a Mixtec region known as √ëui√±e, or lowland Mixtec. Ceramics from the Cerro de las Minas site The site covers fifty hectares and was mostly inhabited by the upper social classes of the time. It was supported by farmlands in the valley below. The ceremonial area is dominated by three large constructed mounds which are eight meters high and forty meters in diameter. They are lined up and separated by large open platforms for a total length of 180 meters. The site also contain a Mesoamerican ballcourt that is about sixty meters long and fifteen meters wide. The housing units have stone foundations and either adobe or stone walls. In these foundations numerous human burials have been found. There is also a large plaza situated on the south side which contains a mass grave. In this grave, large quantities of ceramics were found of native design as well as a multicolored urn with an image of the god of wind or fire, with a brazier on its head. It is seated on a platform with four glyphs indicating location. It is now on display at the Museum of Oaxaca. The site is considered to have two stages. One is called √ëudee, which is the original Mixtec name for Huajuapan and means \\"place of the brave,\\" and covers the era between 400 BCE and 250 CE. The other is called Nui√±e and covers the time period between 250 and 800 CE. Artifacts here show that during both periods, this settlement had strong ties with other Mixtec settlements in other parts of modern-day Oaxaca. The area began to decline after 800 CE, possibly due to military pressure from lords in other regions. The region would not grow again until the Spanish established their city here in the 16th century. Demographics The great majority of the people living in Huajuapan de Le√≥n are of Mixtec descent. The Mixtec language is not generally heard in the city, however. The Mixteca region of which Huajuapan is part has a high rate of immigration to the United States and remittances are important for the local economy. Festival of the Se√±or de los Corazones Main altar of the Chapel of the Se√±or de los Corazones with image The festival of the Se√±or de los Corazones is related to the siege that Huajuapan endured for 111 days during the War of Independence. Jos√© Remigio Sarabia Rojas, an Indian from the nearby town of Santiago Nuyoo, evaded royalist lines and managed to reach Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos who was in Chilapa, Guerrero. He told Morelos that Huajuapan was under siege and needed help. Morelos first sent General Miguel Bravo, who arrived in the city with thousands of men along with Vicente Guerrero. To ask for divine aid in the rescue of Huajuapan, Morelos asked his troops to observe a novena. According to legend, the novena ended on 23 July, the same day the insurgents were able to break the siege. The festival is celebrated on 23 July of every year, with a novena beginning on 14 July. Processions, organized by a brotherhood created especially for this purpose, are held for each day of the novena, with participants carrying an image of the Se√±or de los Corazones. The 23rd is celebrated with cultural and artistic events as well as fair rides and fireworks. Mass is celebrated to give thanks for the divine aid received during the siege. On the 24th one last major procession for the image wanders through the main streets of the city from eight in the morning to three in the afternoon, from the Chapel of the Sagrario to the Cathedral.

However, according to municipal statistics, one can note that at most, forty-seven out of every hundred inhabitants finished primary school while those that partly attended high school reach 23%. These statistics are low compared with the national average of people that finish their primary, which stands at 7.34 years. The state's average is 5.29 years. An important regional university (Universidad Tecnol√≥gica de la Mixteca) has been operating in Huajuapan since 1991 with the aim of promoting development of the area.

The school, then known \\"The New School\\", opened to boys aged 10 to 19 in 1889. From the very beginning, the school departed from the structure of the traditional public school in favour of a less rigid environment and more liberal education. Top hats and \\"Eton collars\\" were discarded in favour of a more comfortable and practical uniform, and English, French and German were taught in place of Classics (Latin and Greek). The fine arts were introduced as core subjects, considered unusual at that time, since music and art were mostly taught at cathedral schools or specialist art institutes. Practical skills such as animal husbandry and carpentry were integrated into the curriculum. It has been coeducational since 1969; girls now make up over one third of overall pupil numbers.

History Dalewood House, the main school building, was constructed in 1883 by a local developer called Charles J Fox. The House was designed by the Victorian architect, John Norton (who also designed a number of other buildings of distinction within the UK and Europe including the National Trust house Tyntesfield in Somerset). Although the house was built during the Victorian era, its design is both mock Tudor and Gothic Revival. The interior is full of hand-painted tiles, beautifully crafted stained glass windows, and fine wood panelling, with magnificent fireplaces throughout. In 1890 the house was sold to David Evans (one of the nineteenth century‚Äôs pre-eminent silk printers and chairman of 'David Evans & Co'), on whose death it passed to his daughter Lucie Fosberie until 1939. Before Box Hill School took occupation of the house it was in almost continuous private ownership by the Evans family but was converted into use as a school building after the Second World War. The house was requisitioned by the Army as the headquarters of the Pay Corps during the Second World War. In 1951 the house was taken over and run as a school by two Australian sisters.

She was named after Mount Tsukuba located in Ibaraki prefecture north of Tokyo. On 28 August 1912, Tsukuba was re-classified as a battlecruiser. page 77 Background Construction of the Tsukuba-class cruisers was ordered under the June 1904 Emergency Fleet Replenishment Budget of the Russo-Japanese War, spurred on by the unexpected loss of the battleships and to naval mines in the early stages of the war.Chesneau, Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1905‚Äì1921, page 232 These were the first major capital ships to be designed and constructed entirely by Japan in a Japanese shipyard, albeit with imported weaponry and numerous components. However, Tsukuba was designed and completed in a very short time, and suffered from numerous technical and design problems, including strength of its hull, stability and mechanical failures. The ship was reclassified as a battlecruiser in 1912. Design The Tsukuba-class design had a conventional armored cruiser hull design, powered by two vertical triple-expansion steam engines, with twenty Miyabara boilers, yielding design speed of and a range of at . During speed trials in Hiroshima Bay prior to commissioning, Tsukuba attained a top speed of . In terms of armament, the Tsukuba-class was one of the most heavily armed cruisers of its time, with four 12-inch 41st Year Type guns as the main battery, mounted in twin gun turrets to the fore and aft, along the centerline of the vessel. Secondary armament consisted of twelve guns and twelve 4.7-inch 41st Year Type guns, and four QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns. Service record Tsukuba was laid down on 14 January 1905, launched 26 December 1905 and commissioned on 14 January 1907 at Kure Naval Arsenal, with Captain Takenouchi Heitaro as her chief equipping officer and first captain. Shortly after commissioning, and with Admiral Ijuin Gor≈ç on board, Tsukuba was sent on a voyage to the United States to attend the Jamestown Exposition of 1907, the tricentennial celebrations marking the founding of the Jamestown Colony. She then traveled on to Portsmouth, England and returned to Japan via the Indian Ocean, thus circumnavigating the globe. After her return to Japan, Tsukuba was assigned to Captain Hirose Katsuhiko (the brother of the war hero Takeo Hirose) and escorted the United States Navy‚Äôs Great White Fleet through Japanese waters on its around-the-world voyage in October 1908. Captain Isamu Takeshita was captain of Tsukuba from July through September 1912, followed by Captain Kantar≈ç Suzuki to May 1913, and Captain Kanji Kato from December 1913 to May 1914. Tsukuba served in World War I, initially during the blockade of the German port of Tsingtao in China during the Battle of Tsingtao from September 1914 as part of Japan's contribution to the Allied war effort under the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. After the fall of the city, Tsukuba was sent out as part of the search for the German East Asiatic Squadron in the South Pacific until the destruction of the German squadron in the Battle of the Falklands in December 1914. Tsukuba remained in Japanese home waters in 1915 and 1916. On 4 December 1915, Tsukuba was in a fleet review off of Yokohama, attended by Emperor Taish≈ç in which 124 ships participated. A similar fleet review was held again off Yokohama on 25 October 1916. On 14 January 1917, Tsukuba exploded while in port at Yokosuka. Some 200 crewmen were killed immediately, and over 100 more were drowned as the cruiser sank in shallow waters within twenty minutes, with a total loss of 305 men. The force of the explosion broke windows in Kamakura, more than twelve kilometers away. At the time of the disaster, more than 400 crewmen were on shore leave, which is why so many survived. The cause of the explosion was later attributed to a fire in her ammunition magazine, possibility through spontaneous combustion from deterioration of the Shimose powder in her shells. The masts, bridge and smokestacks of the vessel remained above water, and afterwards, her hulk was raised, and used as a target for naval aviation training. It was formally removed from the navy list on 1 September 1917 and broken up for scrap in 1918.

It is the primary setting of these trilogies. \\"For as long as the sands spawn fire...\\" The Desert is Prince Rohan's princedom. It is the home or birthplace of most of the main characters of Dragon Prince. The royal color of the Desert is blue; its banner is of a gold dragon on a blue field. It is a land rich in dragons, Fire, and sand. The Desert people are known for their rugged strength, loyalty, and fierceness. Land The Desert is an eastern princedom with only one seaport: Radzyn Keep. It is bordered by Princemarch, Cunaxa, Meadowlord, and Syr. The Desert is the hottest, driest princedom and one of the largest. The Long Sand, through which there is no water and no shelter from the sweltering sun, stretches the length of princedom. To the West of the Long Sand there are some mountains and some vegetation, and Skybowl is nestled above a lake. Near Stronghold is Rivenrock, a valley where dragons breed and where the dragon eggs can be gathered for their gold. To the East is Radzyn and the sea, the Desert's sole port and main trade center. To the inhabitants of the Desert, their Princedom is beautiful. The sun gleams over the vast sands and sends a myriad of colors into the dawn and evening skies as a rainbow shimmers across the dunes. Night falls like a balm on the scorched land, and the clear sky allows the stars to twinkle brightly. Every hundred years the Desert blooms. This is a miracle to the Desert-born, who finally see their beloved land covered in flowers and tall, green stalks. Winter rains soak into the sands and churn up soil that had been long buried. Seeds that had been brought on winds and dragon wings sprout, scrubs and cacti bloom vividly colored flowers. With the foliage came butterflies, other insects, and a plethora of singing birds. People Traditionally the people of the Desert have dark hair and tanned skin. (Rohan and Pol inherited their blond locks from Milar, who was from Catha Freehold not the Desert.) They are known for their strength and untamed spirit, both of which match their land. Until Prince Rohan, the Desert was ruled by warrior Princes, whose test of manhood included dragon hunting. Once Rohan became Prince he outlawed the slaying of dragons, but the warrior spirit of the Desertborn lived on in him and in the Desert people. In fact, the Desert has never been conquered (since the Merida were driven out in ancient times and the pact was made between Zehava's ancestors and the Isulk'im). Culture Much of a Desert person's way of life is associated with dragons. Babies and children are often referred to as 'hatchlings,' and parents play dragon with their children; the parent wears a cape as wings and is a mighty dragon that has to be slain. Many Desertborn people can also 'feel' when dragons are near. They can sense the great beasts flying overhead before the dragons either are seen or heard. Throughout the series it was common for Rohan, Feylin, and the others to suddenly stop what they were doing and look to the sky; dragons were inevitably flying up above. Dragon hunting had been a glorious event and a test of manhood, but was outlawed by Rohan - his first official act as High Prince. The dragon became the symbol of the Desert as dragons possess all the traits the Desert and its people honor: strength, majesty, loyalty, fierceness, and intelligence (though this was discovered later). Rohan, who also held these qualities and whose love of dragons marked his reign, became known as Azhrei, which means 'Dragon Prince' in the Old Tongue, or even just 'the Dragon.' To the people of the Desert, their Prince is a living flame. His Fire burns from the Flametower of Stronghold as beacon over the land, a light of hope and prosperity. Each Prince of the Desert lights his Fire in the Flametower. It burns for the length of his life and the tower is never cleaned throughout it. When the Prince dies, his Fire from the Flametower is built to fill the entire tower room and is used to light his pyre. The Prince is burned so that his ashes are carried across the sands, making him one with the land. After the signal blaze from the tower, the Fire is finally extinguished. The new Prince's wife or closest female relatives must then cleanse the Flametower floor. When it is clean the new Prince lights his own Fire, so that it too will shine for his people. Wealth The main trade of the Desert is in horses and horse breeding, though there are also mines, salt, and silk trades. Radzyn Keep breeds the best horses, and also exports silk. The Isulk'im, nomadic tribesmen, ride the sands and guard the White Crown. (The Princes of the Desert and the Isulk'im share a common ancestor; the White Crown symbolizes the Prince's right to rule the Desert.) They also 'borrow' Radzyn's horses for their own stock. The Merida jealously covet the Desert and its royal seat of Stronghold. They had once ruled the Desert and have sworn to reclaim it. Dragon's gold is the secret wealth of the Desert. When hatchling dragons are still in their eggs they scorch the inside of their shells, melting the inner coating and turning it to gold. The egg shells are gathered from the hatcheries and brought to Skybowl, where the shells are smelted into gold bars and/or coins. Very few people are privy to this secret, and the gold often used to help the people. For example, the dragon gold enabled Rohan to purchase and distribute dranath, the only cure for the plague, to the entire Continent. The gold has also been used to rebuild and to lend aid, discreetly, where needed. Princes \\"The Treaty of Linse gives the Desert to Zehava's family for as long as the sands spawn fire.\\" (Dragon Prince pg. 18) Zehava's grandfather, Prince Zagroy wrested that treaty from the High Prince's ancestor after a war between the Desert and Princemarch. Through the treaty Zagory had begun building the princedom of the Desert for his line. Kirwan, Zehava's father, won land from the Merida, and Zehava himself won even more land. He then strengthened what lands and Keeps he had. By the year 698 many of the Desert Keeps were prosperous in their trades, making the Desert the richest princedom of the Continent. See also: Isulk'im The Isulk'im are nomadic tribesmen, who live on the Long Sand. They are distantly related to the Princes of the Desert and hold the White Crown of the Desert, the selej. Their culture and society is very different from the other Desertborn people as they more closely follow the old ways. Places *Elktrap Manor: Northern manor held by Riyan and Ruala. Elktrap belonged to Princemarch before Riyan became its Lord through his marriage to Ruala. The colors are blue and green. *Faolain Lowland: A southern Desert holding near the Faolain River. In the war between Princemarch and the Desert, this Keep was used as an early base of operations. Nearly all the food and goods the Keep had to offer were used to support Chay's army. Baisal, the holding's Lord, had approached Rohan in 698 for stone in order to upgrade his Keep; after the support he gave to the Desert, Baisal received his stone. *The Long Sand: The open expanse of desert sands that stretches across the Desert princedom. There is no water for miles, nor any shelter from the burning sun. The Long Sand is home to the Isulk'im, whom roam the Desert. *Radzyn Keep: The Desert's most prosperous Keep, its largest and safest port, and the home of the Battle Commander of the Desert, Chaynal. Radzyn is also known for its horses. The importance of this Keep is such that Chaynal, Lord of Radzyn Keep, is the only Athri with a banner of his own: a silver sword emblazoned on red bordered by white, then bordered by blue. *Remagev: The last Keep in a line that once stretched to Surise Waters, Remagev was where Prince Zagroy made his last stand against the Merida. Since his victory the Keep fell into disarray and was in danger of being swallowed by the Long Sand. At the gathering of 705, the Keep was given to Walvis, Rohan's first squire, for his devotion and leadership against the Merida in the Battle of Tiglath. Under Walvis' governance, Remagev became a strong, working Keep and a training ground for young Lords and Princes across the Continent. Training at Remagev under Walvis became not only the next step in a noble's battle training, but paved the way for younger sons to become Medr'im, a type of police force that upheld the High Prince's Writ. *Rivenrock Canyon: Breeding ground of the dragon's near Stronghold. It was here that Sioned and Rohan rescued Maarken and Jahni from a hatchling and discovered dragon's gold. After the plague the dragons left Rivenrock until Pol cleansed the Desert with Fire during the sorcerer's duel with Ruval. *Whitecliff Manor: The holding the Heir to Radzyn Keep opens upon his marriage. Once he becomes Lord of Radzyn, the Manor is closed once more. Whitecliff's colors are red and orange. Feruche Feruche Castle is an important tower Keep that has been coveted and fought over for generations. This Keep controls the trade route between Princemarch and the Desert. It had been a Merida holding, but Zehava promised it to High Prince Roelstra in exchange for aid against them. Roelstra gave Feruche to his daughter, Ianthe, who used it as a prison for both Rohan and Sioned. The castle held nightmares for each of them as they had been tortured - Sioned held in a lightless cell and raped by many soldiers, Rohan drugged and fevered. It was also Pol's birthplace. Rohan refused to ever set foot inside the Keep again, even years later after the tower had been destroyed by Sioned's Sunrunner Fire and rebuilt by Sorin, who had received it at his knighting. After Sorin's death, Pol gave the Keep to Riyan, who holds it still. The castle itself was built of rose colored stone. It rose high on the cliffs, overlooking a Desert garrison far below. It was the border tower between Princemarch and the Desert. Skybowl Skybowl holds the secret of dragon gold: the eggs of dragons are lined with gold. Since Zehava's rule the people of Skybowl 'mined' this gold and smelted it in the nearby, abandoned caves. The gold was added to special coffers in order to be used to aid the people of the Desert and the Continent itself. During the plague of 701, Rohan used this gold to buy dranath and to distribute the drug as a cure for everyone. Skybowl also played an important role in the Vellanti War as it was where the final battle took place. Skybowl gets its name from the almost perfectly round lake found just outside the Keep. The Keep sits on the slopes of the Vere Hills, built from the gray stones surrounding the crater lake, which used to be a volcano. The depth of the lake is unknown. The Keep itself has only one tower above which flies Skybowl's banner on a post topped with a golden dragon in flight. Inside the Keep are tables with benches, clear glass paned windows, and torches in bronze sconces; the dragon gold is not used for Skybowl's luxury. Skybowl was used in the Vellanti war as a decoy; it was given to the Vellanti High Warlord and was used to poison the Vellanti priests before the final battle. Stronghold Stronghold is the royal seat of the Desert from which the Prince's Fire always lights the land. It was the home of Prince Rohan and his Sunrunner wife, Sioned, and from 704 to 737 it also acted as the seat of the High Prince. This Keep was once just a strong, imposing monstrosity said to have been carved by dragons, built in a hollow through rocky cliffs, but Princess Milar, Zehava's wife and Rohan's mother, turned the fortress into a home. She added a beautiful garden with roses and running water, and also dressed the Keep with rich tapestries. Beneath the Keep lies a labyrinth of secret passages and tunnels. Only the royal family knows the secrets of the tunnels here and the tunnels of the other Desert Keeps. Mydral, Prince Zehava's rumored half-sister, held the secret of Stronghold's tunnels. Stronghold was said to have never fallen before the Vellanti attack. After Rohan's death, Sioned set the Keep ablaze with Sunrunner's Fire. The Keep burned, making it impossible for the Vellant'im High Warlord to use the Keep as his base of operations. During the war, while Mydral lay dying, she told Chayla, Hollis, Tobren, and Betheyn the secrets of the Desert's tunnels, enabling the remaining Desert people to retreat to safety. After the war Pol used this knowledge and the memories of his grandmother's roses to start rebuilding Stronghold. He promised to rebuild the Keep and to burn his Fire in the Flametower as a beacon for his people and as the start of their new future. = Description = Stronghold is a massive military Keep on the foot of the Vere Hills. The main entrance to the Keep is through a narrow valley, about four horse across, and is easily defended. The walls and Keep itself are made of thick stone. The Keep is five stories tall, has another level below ground, then the Flametower, which rises above the Keep to blaze the Fire of the Prince of the Desert for all to see. Some days the Flametower can be seen from the Sunrise Waters to the east. There are a number of political chambers within Stronghold to accommodate Princes. A large, formal chamber off the main foyer is dedicated to assemblies and meetings with the High Prince. The chairs in this room were uncushioned, the floor bare, and a tapestry of Stronghold emphasizes its rulers' strength. The Great Hall is filled and decorated with items from each of the princedoms. The tapestries and banners of resident Prince and Lords also hang there as appropriate. The Summer Room, so named by Lady Sionell of Remagev, is reserved for private audiences. The floor is carpeted, the chairs plump, bookcases line the walls, as do tapestries depicting the Desert in spring and summer, and a tapestry of the Continent and all the princedoms' borders. The living quarters of the Keep are decorated in blues and greens. Tiles line the bathroom floors, surrounding a white, iron tub on a carved, wooden frame. The beds were large, carved wood, and covered in blue and green silk sheets. The windows of the keep were open, letting in as many breezes as they possibly could, with thin, silken drapes. The garden Princess Milar planted contained a grotto, where trees surrounded a small pool. A waterfall filled the pool, running down from the Hills. Mosses and ferns grew around the pool, soaking in the rare wealth of water. = Flametower = The tallest tower of Stronghold, which blazes with the Fire of the Prince of the Desert. This Fire is a beacon of strength and leadership for the people. Each Prince must light his own Fire after the previous one died and the tower room had been cleansed of the last Prince's ash and soot. The tower has pointed, arching windows, each open to the wind, and above each window is the carving of a dragon. It was in this tower that Rohan first saw Sioned's face in the Fire.

She was named after Mount Ikoma located on the border of Osaka and Nara prefecture. On 28 August 1912, Ikoma was re-classified as a battlecruiser.Jentsura, Jung & Mickel, p. 77 Background Construction of the Tsukuba-class cruisers was ordered under the June 1904 Emergency Fleet Replenishment Budget of the Russo-Japanese War, spurred on by the unexpected loss of the battleships and to naval mines in the early stages of the war.Chesneau, p. 232 These were the first major capital ships to be designed and constructed entirely by Japan in a Japanese shipyard, albeit with imported weaponry and numerous components. However, Tsukuba and Ikoma were designed and completed in a very short time, and suffered from numerous technical and design problems, including strength of its hull, stability and mechanical failures. The ship was reclassified as a battlecruiser in 1912. Design The Tsukuba-class design had a conventional armored cruiser hull design, powered by two vertical triple-expansion steam engines, with twenty Miyabara boilers, yielding design speed of and a range of at . During speed trials in Hiroshima Bay prior to commissioning, Tsukuba attained a top speed of . Ikoma was one of the first ships in the Japanese navy with boilers capable of burning either coal or heavy fuel oil. In terms of armament, the Tsukuba class was one of the most heavily armed cruisers of its time, with four 12-inch 41st Year Type guns as the main battery, mounted in twin gun turrets to the fore and aft, along the centerline of the vessel. Secondary armament consisted of twelve guns and twelve 4.7-inch 41st Year Type guns, and four QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns. Service record Ikoma was laid down on 15 March 1905, launched 9 April 1906 and commissioned on 24 March 1908 at Kure Naval Arsenal, with Captain Egarashi Yasutaro as her chief equipping officer and first captain. Shortly after commissioning at the Kure Naval Arsenal, Ikoma escorted the United States Navy‚Äôs Great White Fleet through Japanese waters on its around-the-world voyage in October 1908. In 1910, Ikoma was sent on a voyage to Argentina to attend that nation‚Äôs independence centennial celebrations. From Buenos Aires, she continued on across the Atlantic Ocean to London, England and to other ports in Europe and returned to Japan via the Indian Ocean, thus circumnavigating the globe. Ikoma served in World War I, initially during the blockade of the German port of Tsingtao in China during the Battle of Tsingtao from September 1914 as part of Japan's contribution to the Allied war effort under the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. After the fall of the city, Tsukuba was sent out as part of the search for the German East Asiatic Squadron in the South Pacific until the destruction of the German squadron in the Battle of the Falklands in December 1914. From 1 November 1914 to 17 January 1915, Ikoma was based out of Hong Kong, Singapore and Townsville, Australia, protecting British colonies and shipping from German commerce raiders. On 4 December 1915, Ikoma was in a fleet review off of Yokohama, attended by Emperor Taish≈ç in which 124 ships participated. A similar fleet review was held again off Yokohama on 25 October 1916. Ikoma remained in Japanese home waters in 1916 and 1917. Ikoma was a victim of the Washington Naval Agreement of 1922 and was scrapped at Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Nagasaki shipyards in compliance with that accord.

Background Annur Dharmaveera Namboorar Sri K Govindaswamy Naidu was born to an agricultural family. His formative years were difficult, and he had very little formal education. For a while, he worked with his father who was a highway contractor. He started his own business before he was twenty years old, after gaining experience in a grocery shop as an assistant. Industry In 1932, KG started his first ginning factory. Over the next six decades, his industrial ventures were in cotton ginning and spinning, weaving denim fabrics, manufacturing terry towels, castings, motor pumpsets and entertainment with an asset base of Rs.2 billion and sales of Rs. 3 billion, of which more than 25% came from exports. He believed in modern technology and set high standards in the business practices and for products manufactured. Revival of sick units was one of his business strategies. To create employment in rural areas, he located all his factories in villages, away from the urban areas. He insisted on employing women wherever possible. He was monumental in establishing Indias' first multiplex KG cinemas. Philanthropy KG was a proponent of such ideals as vegetarianism, teetotalism, piety, simple living and punctuality. He was an early riser who believed that hardwork and discipline helped achieve whatever goals you set in business. His favourite deity was Palani Sri Dhandayudapani Swamy, who he believed to be the source of all his achievements. KG donated generously to a number of causes: religious, educational, medical service, social services, and poverty alleviation. Among his good works are six schools, a hospital with 300 beds, and scores of temples. Annandhanam ‚Äì serving food ‚Äî was his favorite act of service. He donated to mosques and churches also. He believed that he was only an instrument in the hands of Muruga in his service to humanity.

The territories which the association has taken under its especial care included in the early 20th century: the Diocese of Kulm; the Delegature of Brandenburg and Pomerania, belonging to the Prince-Bishopric of Breslau; the Vicariate Apostolic of Saxony; the Dioceses of Paderborn, Hildesheim, Osnabr√ºck and Fulda; the Northern Missions. The association was managed by a general committee at Paderborn; the diocesan committees have entire control of the contributions they receive; after consultation with their respective diocesan councils, and under the approval of the general committee, the diocesan committees designate the objects to which the money shall be given. Millions have been collected and many churches erected or aided. Besides the diocesan committees another important branch was formed by the Boniface collecting societies. The first of these was founded in 1885 among the merchants of Paderborn by the Marist congregation; this branch of the association was designed to care for the religious training of Catholic children in non-Catholic communities, by the founding of orphan asylums and institutions where children are prepared for their first communion, funded by the collection and sale of objects of little value in themselves, such trifles as tin-foil, old postage stamps, clothing, leaden seals, old coins, books, cigar bands and - tips. Related to the Boniface Association was the Academic Boniface Association. Since 1860 the general association has had a printing office (the Bonifatius press) and since 1888 a bookstore for old and new publications, both at Paderborn. The popes have granted indulgences and privileges to priests connected with the association. The association started issuing the \\"Bonifatiusblatt\\" in 1850; the \\"Schlesisches Bonifatiusblatt\\", 1860 and the \\"St. Bonifatiusblatt\\" at Prague, founded in 1904. Recent history The organization was renamed \\"Bonifatiuswerk der deutschen Katholiken\\" in 1968. In 1974 it expanded its activities to attend to the diaspora in Scandinavia, and since 1995 it is also active in Estonia and Latvia.

Based partly on the Milirrpum v Nabalco Pty Ltd case and making use of professional actors as well as Aboriginal activists who were involved in the case, it was a mix of facts and fiction. The ant mythology was claimed as Herzog's own, but some natives did consider the green ant as the totem animal that created the world and humans. Wandjuk Marika noted that the ant dreaming belief existed in a clan that lived near Oenpelli in the Northern Territory.Hurley, AW (2006) \\"Re-imagining Milirrpum v Nabalco in Werner Herzog's Where the Green Ants Dream. Passages: law, aesthetics, politics 2006, Australia. The film is set in the Australian desert and is about a land feud between a mining company called Ayers (based on Nabalco) and the native Aborigines. The Aborigines claim that an area the mining company wishes to work on is the place where green ants dream, and that disturbing them will destroy humanity. The film was entered in the 1984 Cannes Film Festival. Marika, recommended to Herzog by Phillip Adams, was a leader for the Rirratjingu people, an artist and musician who was involved in activism for Aboriginal rights. His didgeridoo music is used in the movie and several members of his family were cast in the film. The contract with Herzog allowed the Marikas to make enough money to move from Yirrkala to their ancestral region of Yalangbara, Port Bradshaw. Critics of the film found it uncomfortably placed between a documentary and a feature film. Phillip Adams was particularly incensed and claimed that the film implied that the Australian Government was against the Aborigines, leading him to write an article titled \\"Dammit Herzog, you are a Liar!\\"Adams, P (1984), \\"Dammit Herzog, You Are a Liar!\\", The Weekend Australian Magazine, 2‚Äì3 June, p. 2.

He co-organized \\"Project New Orleans\\" with collaborators Carol McMichael Reese and Anthony Fontenot, to support the post- Katrina city. In 2008, Sorkin was appointed Distinguished Professor of Architecture of the City University of New York.  Design practice  He was a principal in the Michael Sorkin Studio. The studio in New York City focuses primarily on professional practice in the urban public realm. Sorkin designed environmental projects in Hamburg, Germany, and proposed master plans for the Palestinian capital in East Jerusalem, and the Brooklyn waterfront and Queens Plaza in New York City. His urban studies have been the subject of gallery exhibits, and in 2010, he received the American Academy of Arts and Letters award in architecture. Sorkin presented regularly at regional, national, and international conferences, and he served as adviser and juror on numerous professional committees, including The Guggenheim Helsinki Design Competition, The Aga Khan Trust for Culture's Aga Khan Award for Architecture, Chrysler Design Award, the New York City Chapter of the American Institute of Architecture, Architectural League of New York, and in the area of design writing and commentary, for Core 77.

Bencoolen Street is a street in Central, Singapore that starts at the junction of Rochor Road, Rochor Canal Road and Jalan Besar and ends at the junction of Fort Canning Road, Stamford Road and Orchard Road. The street houses several landmarks including Sim Lim Square, Bencoolen Mosque and Albert Complex. A number of hotels and serviced apartments exist, namely Summer View Hotel, Bayview Hotel Singapore, Hotel 81 Bencoolen, Strand Hotel, Rendezvous Hotel and Somerset Bencoolen. It is accessible via Bencoolen MRT station which is located under Bencoolen Street itself. Etymology and history Bencoolen Street was named in remembrance of Sir Stamford Raffles' position as Lieutenant Governor in Bencoolen (now Bengkulu), Sumatra, as well as that it was located in Kampong Bencoolen. When Raffles came to the island in 1819, a number of Bencoolen Malays came as well and settled in the area where the street was. When the British gave up Bencoolen in 1824, after signing the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824, the number of Bencoolen Malays grew. The majority of the oldest Singaporean Malays and Eurasians descended from the Bencoolen Malays. Kampong Bencoolen covers the area of Bencoolen Street itself, Waterloo Street, Prinsep Street, Middle Road and Albert Street. Bencoolen Muslims built a mosque between 1825 and 1845 known as the Bencoolen Mosque. The first building was made from attap. In 1845, an Arab merchant known as Syed Omar bin Aljunied built the second building. Bencoolen Mosque was demolished in the early 2000s and made way for a new mosque. The mosque is currently owned by Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura (MUIS). Along with the new mosque, a service apartment building run by the Ascott Group exists. The graveyards of the Bencoolen Muslims were located where the current Istana is, facing Orchard Road.

Originally formed in 1949, the squadron is currently part of the 6th Engineer Support Regiment and is based at RAAF Base Amberley. Personnel from the squadron have deployed on operations during the Vietnam War, in Namibia, East Timor, and the ongoing War in Afghanistan. The squadron has participated in the Army Aboriginal Community Assistance Program since 1997, and has also been called upon to provide assistance to the wider Australian community following natural disasters, including most recently in the wake of the 2010‚Äì11 Queensland floods. History=Squadron origins (1949‚Äì1965) 17th Construction Squadron was raised out of the Eastern Command Maintenance Squadron on 20 September 1949 as a Regular unit, under the command of Captain E. Phillips. Upon formation it consisted of three troops: 8, 9 and 10. Squadron headquarters was located at Kingsford, New South Wales, along with the 9 and 10 Troops, while 8 Troop was located in the Moore Park area. The year later, Plant Troop was raised and moved to Woomera, South Australia.Grantham 1978, p. 27. It had initially been planned that the squadron would form part of a regimental formation known as the 4th Construction Regiment, but the regiment was never raised and the squadron was formed as an independent unit.Greville 2002, p. 30. During the period between 1950 and 1965 the squadron carried out considerable construction and relief tasks both within Australia and overseas. It was involved in the construction of the Woomera Rocket Range from 1950 to 1954. In 1953 it was also involved in the site construction for project \\"Two Zero Zero\\", an atomic weapons test site. Between January and October 1953, the squadron worked to prepare the site ahead of the detonation of the first atomic weapon exploded on the Australian mainland, which took place in October 1953 under the guise of Operation Totem.Greville 2002, p. 471. In 1956, work was undertaken at Moorebank where the squadron constructed a pontoon harbour and also at Randwick where work on new soldiers' accommodation was completed. In 1960, an element from 8 Troop was deployed to New Hebrides to help restore Port Vila after it was struck by a cyclone.Greville 2002, pp. 584‚Äì585. The following year, 10 Troop was detached to the command of the 24th Construction Squadron and deployed to Vanimo and Passam, Papua New Guinea, where they completed road building tasks and constructed a 300-ton wharf. In June 1963, the main body of the squadron deployed to Wewak, taking over from the 21st Construction Squadron, before returning to Australia in June 1964, having been replaced by the 22nd Construction Squadron.Greville 2002, pp. 525‚Äì527. South Vietnam (1966‚Äì1971) The most significant part of squadron history was its involvement in the Vietnam War. The squadron was in South Vietnam from 1966 to 1971 and was involved in a wide variety of engineering tasks. The first to deploy was 8 Troop, which was initially based around Vung Tau, although they were later deployed to the 1st Australian Task Force base at Nui Dat in August 1966.Greville 2002, p. 670. At Nui Dat, elements of the squadron took part in the defence of the base during an attack the day before the Battle of Long Tan; amidst heavy indirect fire, three members of the squadron were wounded.Greville 2002, p. 744. 10 Troop relieved 8 Troop at Nui Dat in October, and in February 1967 the squadron's third troop, 9 Troop, was deployed to Vietnam.Greville 2002, p. 671. Early tasks undertaken by the squadron included clearing operations in support of the 5th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment during Operation Leeton, and sustainment operations.Greville 2002, p. 699. The construction of helipads and land marking operations were common tasks carried out by Plant Troop. In 1967 the squadron completed a 300,000 gallon dam. This provided the Australian contingent with an alternate water supply.Greville 2002, p. 700. At Nui Dat the squadron set up a large quarrying operation in early 1968. The squadron was also involved in the construction of the 1st Australian Logistics Support Group (1 ALSG) base amid the sand dunes at Vung Tau following its occupation in May 1966.Greville 2002, p. 666. Although a detachment of engineers from 1 RAR Group had commenced basic works to prepare the area prior to the lodgement, including a basic water supply and road construction, much work remained. Lacking basic facilities for logistic operations including unloading facilities, roads and hardstanding, 1 ALSG struggled to become operational and commence logistic support to 1 ATF forward at Nui Dat. Meanwhile, basic hygiene and stifling heat were also a significant problem.McNeill 1993, p. 230‚Äì231. Urgent work was required and the development plan included cutting and spreading the sand dunes, reclaiming large areas of swamp land, road construction, establishing accommodation, hardstanding, storage areas, workshops and vehicles parks, as well as extensive drainage works.Greville 2002, p. 679. Other tasks included winning construction resources, water purification and supply, electricity generation, survey, bridging and rafting, and civil aid.Greville 2002, p. 680. Helipads were also constructed to enable 1 ALSG to be resupplied by helicopter and for 2 Field Ambulance to receive casualties.Greville 2002, p. 684. Later, in April 1968 a quarry was also constructed at Vung Tau to supply crushed rock, gravel and fine sand for the pavement of roads, airfields, helipads and development of hardstanding.Greville 2002. p. 683. Land clearing operations had been undertaken by 1st Field Squadron since the occupation of Nui Dat to improve base defences and observation. Later they were extended for tactical purposes to open up key routes within Phuoc Tuy by removing vegetation to deny cover and concealment to the Viet Cong, and also provided arable land for villagers as part of the Pacification program.Greville 2002, pp. 783‚Äì784.Parker 1972, p. 40. In March 1968, a dedicated Land Clearing Team was formed by 17th Construction Squadron elements at Nui Dat to supplement existing arrangements.Greville 2002, p. 787. One particular operation, codenamed \\"Cooktown Orchid\\" conducted in April 1968, saw a large element of Plant Troop deploy under infantry and armoured protection to clear undergrowth and trees in the foothills of the Long Hai mountains. Land clearance operations proved quite dangerous for the plant operators who were exposed to land mines and booby traps, as well as to attack by small arms and other direct fire weapons.Parker 1972, p. 41. During this operation one D8 bulldozer was destroyed, and a sapper injured when an RPG round hit the dozer he was operating.Greville 2002. p. 788. In 1969 the squadron continued with land clearing tasks within the 1 ATF area of operations. During the operation, numerous bunker systems were uncovered and the D8 dozers detonated many mines. In August 1969, 9 Troop assisted in replacing a sabotaged bridge with a floating pontoon bridge. The enemy had blown the bridge on National Route 51, south-east of Saigon. The troop, working with the US Engineers, took only 13 hours to re-open the road. 1970 saw the squadron heavily committed to Project 399,Greville 2002, p. 673. the civil aid program involving the construction of housing for Regional Force soldiers and their families throughout Phuoc Tuy province. The squadron built a total of 410 houses at sites such as Baria, An Nhuit, Dat Do, Ong Trinh and Duc Thanh. On 20 September the unit celebrated its 21st birthday. Later that year, John Sanderson was appointed Officer Commanding. It was at about this time that the unit adopted the \\"Little Bear\\" symbol and the motto, \\"A Little Bear will Fix It\\", which is well known on Norton's Bear Brand Tape. The little bear was created in the mid-1950s by Sydney cartoonist Syd Miller and has been in extensively since that time. Quarrying operations during 1970, with the squadron operating Hadfield and Aveling-Barford crushers at three sites.Greville 2002, p. 177. Throughout 1971 a number of major road projects were completed, as was a bridge over the Song Rai River.Greville 2002, p. 182. The squadron subsequently returned to Australia,Grantham 1978, p. 28. where it moved to Enoggera, Queensland.Greville 2002, p. 44. At the height of its involvement in Vietnam, the squadron consisted of 12 officers and 334 other ranks.Greville 2002, p. 674. Enoggera and disbandment (1972‚Äì1973) The decade of the 1970s saw the demise of the squadron as the RAE was reorganised around a regimental structure. In February 1972, it was renamed the 17th Field Squadron, as part of 2nd Field Engineer Regiment, based at Enoggera.Greville 2002, pp. 43‚Äì44. While part of the regiment, the squadron completed construction works in Tully as part of the regiment's involvement supporting the Medium Tank Trials Unit.Greville 2002, p. 49. Public relations projects were also undertaken including work on Tully hospital, schools, golf and bowling clubs. In mid-1973, 17th Field Squadron merged with 7th Field Squadron, and the unit's designation fell off the Royal Australian Engineers Order of Battle. The unit remained disbanded until 1977. Re-raised in Sydney (1977‚Äì1989) In August 1977, the 17th Construction Squadron was re-raised at Gallipoli Lines, Holsworthy Barracks, as part of the 1st Construction Regiment. Upon establishment, the unit was placed under the command of Major John Koek. The squadron's first task saw it sent to Nowra, where it was tasked with constructing fuel storage tanks for the Royal Australian Navy. In addition to this, the squadron worked to restore the accommodation buildings that it had been assigned. Having established itself, during the first six months of 1978 the squadron completed a number of small construction tasks for surrounding units in the Holsworthy area, including new facilities for the 1st Field Engineer Regiment.Grantham 1978, pp. 28 & 31. An annual camp was also held at Gosper, New South Wales.Grantham 1978, p. 31. In 1979, the 17th Construction Squadron was placed on stand-by for service in Namibia. During the early 1980s operational readiness planning took up a large slice of the squadron's effort. During this decade a large number of construction tasks were still completed, including the construction of the Holsworthy Range Road, the School of Military Engineering Museum upgrade and numerous Lysaght buildings. A detachment also supported 22nd Construction Squadron with the construction of facilities for the Special Air Service Regiment. In 1982 8 Troop performed a small controlled demolition of the Woronora Weir at Engadine. When Severe Tropical Cyclone Isaac hit Tonga on 3 March 1982, killing 6 people and making 45,000 homeless, the entire squadron was deployed to Tonga for a two-week period to assist with urgent shelter and recovery efforts. In 1985 the Squadron rebuilt the airfield at the army's Shoalwater Bay Training Area. In 1987‚Äì88 over a six-month period the Plant Troop constructed a large earth filled dam on the upper Nepean River at the Bents Basin State Recreation Area. The squadron participated in a major exercise with the 1st Construction Regiment at Singleton, New South Wales in 1988. This was the first occasion that the Transfield heavy girder bridge had been constructed on exercise. Also in 1988 9 Troop constructed the Holsworthy Range Control facility and facilities at Penrith. Other works were undertaken overseas by detachments as part of the Defence Co-operation Program. Established in the early 1960s to engage with Southeast Asian nations, in the early 1980s the program was refocused upon the nations in the Southwest Pacific, where a number of construction projects were implemented.Shephard 1993, p. iii. During this time, projects were completed in several countries including: * Tonga: Construction of facilities for the Tonga Defence Services;Crocker & Warren 1985, p. 452. * Vanuatu: To assist Vanuatu in maintaining and operating its Pacific class patrol boat, donated by Australia in 1987, the squadron deployed a composite troop of 30 personnel for four months in 1988 to construct a Patrol Boat Base and support facilities in Port Vila; and * Papua New Guinea where facilities were constructed for the Papua New Guinea Defence Force. In early 1988, the squadron deployed an officer to Wilkes Station, Antarctica to develop an environmental clean-up plan to remove, make safe or dispose of a large accumulation of rubbish, fuel in drums, explosives, chemicals and gas cylinders deposited since the late 1950s. The plan was subsequently carried out over a period of years for the Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions by a series of detachments from the squadron. Just prior to deployment to Namibia in January 1989, 9 Troop was deployed at short notice to construct a Light Assault Floating Bridge (Pontoon bridge) across the Macquarie River on the Mitchell Highway in Wellington, New South Wales which had been destroyed by a truck carrying an excavator. Namibia (1989‚Äì1990) Having been on stand-by since 1979, the squadron finally deployed to Namibia in April 1989 as part of the Military Component of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group UNTAG. An augmented squadron of 275 personnel was deployed which included a Field Engineer troop from 7th Field Squadron. There were two rotations during the deployment, each of six months duration. The second rotation included a troop from the Corps of Royal New Zealand Engineers. During the first rotation, the squadron was involved in a wide variety of tasks. The first task was to lead \\"Operation Safe Passage\\". This required the squadron members (supported by British signallers) to work as infantry and man border and internal assembly points. At the time these were the only military units that could be re-deployed quickly to northern Namibia. The aim of the operation was to facilitate the withdrawal of the South-West Africa People's Organisation's (SWAPO) military wing, the People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN) combatants. A total of nine assembly points were established with 10 soldiers and five military observers at each. Agreement was subsequently reached in late April that the SADF personnel be restricted to their bases from 26 April; and in effect from this date hostilities largely ceased. Over this period of about three weeks it has been estimated that 251 PLAN combatants were killed for the loss of 21 members of the SADF and other Security Forces. The fact that the Australian soldiers survived this operation without casualty was said to be a tribute to the 'training standards of the Australian Army and perhaps, a bit of good luck'. The next major task was to construct and support a number of Returnee Reception centres for the United Nations High Commission for Refugees. The squadron constructed two of the major entry points (at Ongwediva and Engela in Ovamboland), the construction of others was managed by the works office. They were administered under the auspices of the Repatriation, Resettlement and Reconstruction Committee of the Council of Churches in Namibia (CCN). The Squadron was also occupied with route and mine clearance. The SADF laid recognised, marked and fenced, anti- personnel minefields typically as perimeter protection to bases and vital assets. The SADF reported laying 45,000 mines during the conflict of which 3,000 were unaccounted for when UNTAG arrived. SWAPO employed mines as a means of ambushing or intimidation. Much of the work of the 75 Field Engineers deployed with each contingent was area search, clearance of exposed mines, marking minefields and route clearance. Colonel John Crocker, the Commander of the 2nd Contingent wrote that \\"For the first time since the Vietnam War, Australian Sappers hand cleared their way into live minefields on seven separate occasions to destroy exposed mines. Similar mines killed several civilians and many animals during the mission. Field engineers of the contingent destroyed over 5,000 items of unexploded ordnance (UXO) ranging from artillery shells, through RPG rockets to grenades. UXO, a legacy of the 20-year Bush War, posed a major hazard to local inhabitants in the northern provinces and to UNTAG personnel in that area\\". The second rotation provided considerable support to the elections that were conducted in November 1989 and which was the primary task for the remainder of the deployment. Activities commenced with 1 ASC from May 1989 onward, but became the primary task for 2 ASC. Major tasks included: * Service support: Support was provided to approximately 500 electoral centres and police stations through the siting and erection of either permanent or portable accommodation as well as the provision of essential services; * Construction engineering: including the construction, modification or upgrade of UNTAG working and living accommodation, the provision of essential services (power, water and air traffic control facilities) and the maintenance and upgrade of roads and Opuwo airfield. * Ready Reaction Force: On two separate occasions during the November 1989 election, the ASC's Ready Reaction Force was used to disperse rioters who were offering violence to UN election motors, including Australians. The squadron also conducted other works tasks which included an upgrade of the Rundu air base (construction of a movement facility and helipads), construction of a school building for one of the local schools, and the upgrade and maintenance of roads and hard-stands in the area. The second rotation returned to Australia in February 1990. The squadron for their efforts in Namibia received many letters of commendation and appreciation including in 2012 the award of the first Honour Distinction. This is a new (2012) award that provides recognition for outstanding service in operations in other than declared theatres of war. RAAF Scherger (1990‚Äì1996) During the 1990s, the squadron was moved outside of the regimental structure, becoming independent once again. In March 1993, it became involved in the construction of RAAF Base Scherger, near Weipa in Far North Queensland. The biggest project undertaken by the Royal Australian Engineers at the time, the task drew very heavily on the squadron's personnel and resources, with three rotations each year. The squadron's involvement with the project was complete by the end of 1996, although ongoing refurbishment continued throughout 1997. The base was officially opened on 5 August 1998 by the Prime Minister, John Howard. Recent operations and projects=AACAP (1997‚Äìpresent) In 1996, Prime Minister John Howard committed Australian Army resources to improve health related infrastructure in remote Aboriginal communities. Assisting units provide logistic, transport, communication and health support to the soldiers. The Army Aboriginal Community Assistance Program (AACAP) was initiated in 1997 by the 17th Construction Squadron in the Bulla community, in the vicinity of Timber Creek in the Northern Territory. The squadron has been responsible for AACAPs at a number of locations. INTERFET (1999‚Äì2000) At the completion of AACAP Jumbun in 1999 the squadron was deployed at short notice to participate in Operation Warden as part of the International Force for East Timor (INTEFET). Some of the key Squadron activities in East Timor included the construction of the Dili sewage ponds, the extension and resurfacing of the Suai airstrip, drainage works in Dili, the Dili heliport, force water points and support to other units. The squadron was on operations for approximately five months. 6th Engineer Support Regiment (2003‚Äìpresent) In 2003, the 17th Construction Squadron became a part of the 6th Engineer Support Regiment. As a part of this formation, the squadron has remained at Holsworthy, even though the rest of the regiment is split between at Gallipoli Barracks, Enoggera, and Zabul Lines, RAAF Base Amberley. In 2011, the squadron deployed personnel as part of Exercise Pacific Partnership, which saw personnel deployed on board the USS Cleveland from where they were dispatched to Vanuatu, Tonga, Papua New Guinea, East Timor and Micronesia to complete various construction works. The unit was also heavily involved in supporting the Australian Army's commitment to Operation Queensland Flood Assist. It has also contributed personnel to ongoing operations in Afghanistan as part of Operation Slipper, and to Timor Leste as part of Operation Astute. Most recently, the Squadron has deployed members to Iraq in order to support Operation Okra, and Afghanistan in Operation Highroad as part of a train, advise and assist mission. As of 2016, the squadron has relocated to RAAF base Amberley to join the remainder of 6ESR. Awards and commendations The Squadron was awarded a Chief of the General Staff Commendation from Lieutenant General L.G. O'Donnell, the Chief of the General Staff in March 1990 for the deployment to Namibia. In April 2012 The Chief of Army Lieutenant General David Morrison, AO approved a recommendation for the award of the first Honour Distinction to 17th Construction Squadron. This is a new (2012) award that provides recognition for outstanding service in operations in other than declared theatres of war. The Citation for the award reads: The award was presented on 11 May 2013 to the unit in 2013 by The Governor-General of Australia, Her Excellency, Ms Quentin Bryce AC CVO .

He was Regius Professor of Greek at Trinity College Dublin between 1940 and 1980 and served as the 22nd chancellor of the university between 1982 and 1984. He was born in Belfast, the son of a Dublin- born Church of Ireland clergyman who served in Waterford and Tipperary. He was educated at Bishop Foy's School in Waterford, where a special teacher had to be recruited to coach him in Greek. He subsequently won a sizarship to Trinity College Dublin. He was elected a Scholar in his first year at Trinity,J.V. Luce, 'William Bedell Stanford: A memorial address' in Ross Hinds (ed.), William Bedell Stanford: Regius Professor of Greek 1940‚Äì80: Trinity College, Dublin: Memoirs (Hinds, Dublin 2002) p. 229. having become an undergraduate in October 1928.Hinds (2002), p. 59. He also served as auditor of the College Classical Society. He was editor of TCD: A College Miscellany in Hilary term of 1931. He became a Fellow in 1934 and was one of the last Fellows to be elected by examination. Stanford was one of seven candidates nominated for the Provostship of the University on 11 March 1952 but was eliminated along with two other candidates in the first round of the election. He was considered, at the age of 42, to be too junior. The successful candidate on that occasion was the mathematician, Albert Joseph McConnell, who remained in office for 22 years. His grandfather's cousin was the composer Charles Villiers Stanford. Academic career Stanford established himself as a Greek scholar in his twenties with the publication of two books which approached Greek literature as a subject for literary criticism, Greek Metaphor and Ambiguity in Greek Literature. He is perhaps best remembered for his commentaries aimed at students on Homer's Odyssey, Aristophanes' Frogs, and Sophocles' Ajax. In 1965, Stanford gave the Sather Lectures at the University of California, Berkeley, on the topic of the pronunciation of Ancient Greek. The lectures were revised into a book published in 1967. Stanford had a particular interest in the classical tradition, in Ireland and elsewhere, and published a number of articles on this topic in the Trinity journal Hermathena, as well as a brief but wide-ranging book entitled Ireland and the Classical Tradition. A long-time member of the Royal Irish Academy, Stanford was appointed chairman of the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies by the President of Ireland, √âamon de Valera. Stanford's poetry appears in several anthologies and his posthumously published memoirs. After Stanford's death, a series of lectures in his honour was established at Trinity College, Dublin. The first lecturer in the series was Duncan F. Kennedy, a former student of Stanford's. Seanad career He also represented Trinity in Seanad √âireann between 1948 and 1969. During the 1950s, however, he had the courage to come out publicly against the Fethard Boycott, and he also demanded an inquiry into the assault on Jehovah's Witnesses in Clare. In both cases, √âamon de Valera proved sympathetic personally but declined to take any public action. As a leader of the Republic of Ireland's small Protestant population, Stanford was a lifelong champion of the proportional representation electoral process, believing that it protected the rights of minorities.

Vicente Mart√≠nez Risco Ag√ºero (October 1, 1884 in Ourense ‚Äì April 30, 1963 in Ourense) was a Galician intellectual of the 20th Century. He was a founder member of Xeraci√≥n N√≥s, and among the most important figures in the history of Galician literature. He is well regarded for his writings on Galician nationalism, as well as a contributor to the Galician New Narrative. He is also the father of Spanish novelist and critic Antonio Risco.  Early years  The son of a public official, Vicente Risco was born into a well-to- do and highly cultured family. He suffered from bad health as a child. He was a good friend of Ram√≥n Otero Pedrayo. In 1899 he obtained his high school certificate. He studied Law in the University of Santiago, and in 1906 became a public official as his father was. In these years he participated in social gatherings directed by Marcelo Mac√≠as, with other intellectuals, such as Xulio Alonso Cuevillas or Arturo V√°zquez N√∫√±ez, who would significantly influence Vicente Risco's literary career. He read decadent English and French authors, who exposed him to occultism and orientalism. He also studied Buddhism and became a Theosophist author. In 1910 he began work for a local newspaper, El Mi√±o, where he wrote philosophical articles under the pseudonyms Ruj√∫ Sahib and Polichinela. He became a follower of Rabindranath Tagore, announcing the fact in the intellectual social gatherings of Ourense. In February 1912 Risco he met Castelao and praised one of his speeches in El Mi√±o, but Risco was still far from the Galicianist movement. In 1913 he went to Madrid to study Pedagogy. There he was a pupil of Jos√© Ortega y Gasset, spoke with Ram√≥n G√≥mez de la Serna and Luis de Hoyos S√°inz and became attracted to Catholicism. In 1916 he finished his studies and he returned to Ourense as a professor of history. In 1917 he founded, along with Arturo Noguerol Rom√°n, the literary magazine La Centuria, an antecedent of the future nationalist magazine N√≥s. Risco at \\"Praza do Humor\\", A Coru√±a. Encountering Galicianism  Beginning in 1917, Vicente Risco entered the Irmandades da Fala under the influence of Ant√≥n Losada Di√©guez, and on December 18, 1917 he gave his first speech in the Galician language, an act of support for Francesc Camb√≥. In the 1918 campaign for Parliamentary Elections, he made many speeches in the district of Celanova, to no acclaim. In July 1918, Risco began writing articles for A Nosa Terra. He tried to improve the status of Galician literature, writing about Arthur Rimbaud, Paul Verlaine, Apollinaire and Omar Khayyam. Soon Risco had become the main theoretician and leader of Galician nationalism, and in November 1918 he played an important role in the I Nationalist Assembly. In 1920 he published the book Theory of Galician Nationalism, considered the foundational text of Galician nationalism. Risco took ideas from Murgu√≠a and combined them with philosophical irrationalism, geographic determinism, neotraditionalism and ethnography; he defined the nation as a natural entity based on land, race, language, social organization, and national sentiment. He valued Galicia's geographical and cultural connection to Celtic history and the Atlantic region, as opposed to Spain's Mediterranean heritage. In 1920 he started the magazine N√≥s, where he wrote over 100 articles until its cancellation in July 1936. He also directed the ethnographic section of the Seminario de Estudos Galegos. In 1922 he married Mar√≠a Carme Fern√°ndez G√≥mez. In 1923 his first son, Ant√≥n Risco, was born. Risco initially supported the dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera, because he saw in it the opportunity to destroy the caciquist system and accept the role of provincial deputy in Ourense thinking of the possibility of the establishment of a Commonwealth of Galicia, similar to the Commonwealth of Catalonia. After his rupture with the Irmandade da Fala da Coru√±a and A Nosa Terra he wrote for Rexurdimento, the newspaper of the Irmandade Nazonalista Galega (Galician Nationalist Brotherhood), although he returned to A Nosa Terra after a short time. In April 1930 he travelled to Berlin, living there for four months and delivering a course in ethnography at the University of Berlin. After that he became more conservative and Catholic. He wrote a book, Mitteleuropa, in which he described his European trip.  Second Republic  In the VI Nationalist Assembly Risco supported the idea of the transformation of the Irmandades da Fala into a political party. With Ram√≥n Otero Pedraio he founded the Partido Nazonalista Republic√°n de Ourense to take part in the elections of 1931. After losing the election for the position of deputy, he began to lose influence in the Galicianist movement in favour of Otero Pedraio and Castelao. On October 25, 1931, he led a group of Galicianists that published a Catholic manifest against what they considered the persecution of the Catholic Church by the Republican government. In 1933 he published N√≥s, os inadaptados, in which he expounded his spiritual and cyclical conception of history. In the Third Assembly of the PG (October 1935), he accepted temporary collaboration with the left-wing parties to avoid the dissolution of the PG. In January 1935 he published an article in the Heraldo de Galicia, where he called for the reconquest of Galicia by God. In confrontation with the leaders of his party he didn't attend the IV Assembly of the PG in Monforte de Lemos. It was during that assembly the accords with left-wing parties were ratified. In the extraordinary Assembly of Santiago in February 1936 the PG formed a coalition with the Popular Front. Risco united with the group of right-wing Galicianists, and he left the PG to direct Dereita Galeguista. On June 13, 1936, when the campaign began to establish the Statute of Autonomy of Galicia, he supported the affirmative vote. When the Civil War began, he did nothing to help his Galicianist friends that were murdered or imprisoned. From 1937 he directed Misi√≥n, founded with Otero Pedraio. After 1938 he started to write articles for La Regi√≥n where he supported Franco's band. As a result, old Galicianist friends regarded him as a traitor. This is symbolized in the phrase of Castelao in his book Sempre en Galiza: \\"...said Risco, when Risco was somebody\\".  Francoist Spain  In 1940 he published the ethnographic work The end of the world in the Galician popular tradition and in 1944 published History of the Jews after the destruction of the Temple. He lived for a time in Pamplona and wrote articles for El Pueblo Navarro. In 1945 he lived in Madrid, where he wrote articles for El Espa√±ol, Pueblo and La Estafeta Literaria, and he published in 1947 Satan√°s. Biograf√≠a del Diablo. He returned to Ourense in 1948. With the help of Galicianist friends Otero Pedrayo and Francisco Fern√°ndez del Riego, he again started writing in Galician: in his ethnographic studio he wrote History of Galiza directed by Otero Pedrayo, and translated Camilo Jos√© Cela's book The family of Pascual Duarte, completed in 1951. Nevertheless, Castilian would be the language employed in the rest of his literary production after the Civil War. The best book of this stage was La puerta de paja, runner-up to the prestigious Premio Nadal in 1953. He also wrote La tiara de Saitaphernes, Gamalandafa and La ver√≠dica historia del ni√±o de dos cabezas de Promonta, which were not published during his lifetime. He died on April 30, 1963, in Ourense, a few days after Franco's government gave him the Medal of Alfonso X.  Ideology  The political ideology of Vicente Risco was based on a critique of the modern world, considered decadent. He exalted irrationalism, mysticism and popular religion, and rejected realist literature. He also despised Mediterranean civilization in favor of Celticism. Since young he espoused racist ideas, later defined as properly antisemitic. He praised nazism as a \\"vital reaction of the German nation\\". A follower of the essentialism of Manuel Murgu√≠a vis-√†- vis the concept in nation, he saw the Iberian Peninsula as divisible into two parts: north and south from the Duero River. The north would be aryan and superior, and the south semitic and inferior.

He served as Chancellor of the University of Dublin from 1985 to 1998. Biography O'Reilly was born into an affluent family in Dublin amidst the Irish Civil War, the son of a physician. Descended from John Power of the Powers Gold Label whiskey, he was educated at St Gerard's School, Bray, Ampleforth College in Yorkshire and Trinity College Dublin, earning an engineering degree in 1943. During the Second World War, O'Reilly served with the British Army's Royal Engineers from 1943 to 1946, part of which he spent with the 7th Indian Infantry Division during the liberation of Burma from Imperial Japanese occupation in 1944‚Äì45. O'Reilly joined Powers in 1946, during a time when there were only four Irish distilleries left: Powers, Cork Distilleries Company, Jameson Irish Whiskey, and Williams of Tullamore. Since the First World War, the Irish whiskey industry was struggling to stay afloat in the small domestic market, as they had been unable to do normal business in the U.S. because of Prohibition in the United States (1920‚Äì33) and the Anglo-Irish Trade War. By the 1960s, O'Reilly was joint managing director of Powers with his cousin John A. Ryan, but whiskey sales were still in decline. O'Reilly realised the industry needed to be radically reorganised. Powers, which had acquired Tullamore in the 1950s, merged with rivals Cork and Jameson to form Irish Distillers, Ltd. (IDL) in 1966, with O'Reilly serving as its first chairman. O'Reilly was credited with several key decisions that made a lasting contribution to Ireland's economy. In particular, O'Reilly was instrumental in selling IDL to the French company Pernod Ricard in 1988, avoiding a hostile takeover by the UK's Grand Metropolitan group. Other activity O'Reilly was president of the Royal Dublin Society (1986‚Äì89) and served as the 23rd Chancellor of the University of Dublin (1985‚Äì98). He was also a director of Ulster and National Westminster Banks. Equestrian sport O'Reilly was very involved in equestrian sport, and was a member of the National Hunt Steeplechasing Committee, president of the Equestrian Federation of Ireland, chairman of Punchestown Racecourse and of the Kildare Hunt, and steward and trustee of the Turf Club. O'Reilly was instrumental in Dublin being selected as the site of the 10th Show Jumping World Championships in 1982. These world championships were the first to include a compulsory horse inspection prior to the event. Honours O'Reilly was conferred an honorary degree of doctor of laws by Dublin University (1978) and the National University of Ireland (1986). He was also an honorary fellow of his alma mater, Trinity College Dublin. In 2002, O'Reilly was invested as a Knight Commander of the Equestrian Order of St Gregory the Great by Pope John Paul II in recognition of his outstanding contribution to the restoration of the Irish College in Paris. Personal life In 1950, O'Reilly married Teresa \\"Tess\\" Williams, of the Tullamore distilling family. They had 10 children: Mary, Charles, Jane, Olivia, Margaret, Rose, Louise, Peter, Paul and Julie. He died at Rathmore, County Kildare at age 91, survived by his wife and 10 children, and several grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

These small, horned alpine cattle are coloured black, brown or dark red, often with a lighter stripe along the spine. The cows are used in organised cow fights.  Characteristics  Herens steer Herens Cattle are one of the smallest cattle breeds in Europe. Their fur is dark red to brown or black, with pied animals being very uncommon. Newborn calves are red with a dark stripe along the back, with the colours reversing as they grow. A distinguishing feature is the short and broad head, with a concave front line. The animals are very muscular, with both sexes sporting strong horns. Bulls typically reach a height of 125‚Äì134 cm, weighing 650‚Äì700 kg. Cows reach 118‚Äì128 cm and 500‚Äì600 kg. The cattle are bred primarily for beef, but the cows produce around 3,200 kg of milk per year. They are well adapted to pasture in alpine altitudes.  Breeding history  Blood typing shows the Herens to be distinct from other Swiss breeds but similar to the Tuxer breed from the Zillertal in Austria. In 1884 a breeding standard was introduced for this old breed. In 1917 a specialised breeding union was founded. Herens cattle were often cross bred with other cattle breeds in the alpine region. For example, Tux Cattle, √âvol√®ne Cattle, and Pustertal Pied Cattle may be partially related to the Herens. The population of Herens has decreased since the 1960s. In the year 2000 the population was about 13,500 animals. Pure-bred bulls are bred at an insemination station in Neuch√¢tel. There is a breed society in the United States. Cow fighting The Herens is well known for the high aggression of its females. In spring, cows and heifers are made to fight one against another in five weight classes in the local tradition of \\"cow fighting\\". The winners are sold for high prices.

In the process, mining recovers valuable recyclable materials, a combustible fraction, soil, and landfill space. The aeration of the landfill soil is a secondary benefit with regard to the landfill's future use. The combustible fraction is useful for power generation. The overall appearance of the landfill mining procedure is a sequence of processing machines laid out in a functional conveyor system. The operating principle is to excavate, sieve and sort the landfill material. The Hiriya landfill operated by the Dan Region Authority next to the city of Tel Aviv, Israel, introduced the concept of mining as early as 1953.Landfill Mining Paper D.J. van der Zee, et al. (2004) \\"Assessing the market opportunities of landfill mining\\". Waste Manag. 24(8):795-804. Waste contains many resources with high value, the most notable of which are non-ferrous metals such as aluminium cans and scrap metal. The concentration of aluminium in many landfills is higher than the concentration of aluminum in bauxite from which the metal is derived.  Practical applications  Landfill mining is also possible in countries where land is not available for new landfill sites. In this instance landfill space can be reclaimed by the extraction of biodegradable waste and other substances then refilled with wastes requiring disposal. Mining construction landfill sites is the simplest form of landfill mining. Construction landfills in the United States contain three basic components, wood, scrap metal and gypsum, or drywall, along with a minimal amount of other construction materials. The wood collected can be used as fuel in coal burning power plants and the scrap metal reprocessed. European landfills tend to have more masonry from demolished bricks, tiles and concrete.The case for pre demolition audits Mining of municipal landfills is more complicated and has to be based on the expected content of the landfill. Older landfills, in the United States before 1994, were often capped and closed, essentially entombing the waste. This can be beneficial for waste recovery. It can also create a higher risk for toxic waste and leachate exposure as the landfill has not fully processed the stewing wastes. Mining of bioreactor landfills and properly stabilized modern sanitary landfills provides its own benefits. The biodegradable wastes are more easily sieved out, leaving the non-biodegradable materials readily accessible. The quality of these materials for recycling and reprocessing purposes is not as high as initially recycled materials, however materials such as aluminum and steel are usually excluded from this. Landfill mining is most useful as a method to remediate hazardous landfills. Landfills that were established before landfill liner technology was well established often leak their unprocessed leachate into underlying aquifers. This is both an environmental hazard and also a legal liability. In the US, the Environmental Protection Agency requires closed landfills to be monitored for at least 30 years after waste placement ceases. Mining the landfill simply to lay a safe liner is a last, but sometimes necessary resort.  Methods  The parts of the mining process are the different mining machines. Depending on the complexity of the process more or fewer machines can be used. Machinery is easily transported on trucks from site to site, mounted on trailers. An excavator or front end loader uncovers the landfilled materials and places them on a moving floor conveyor belt to be taken to the sorting machinery. A trommel is used to separate materials by size. First, a large trommel separates materials like appliances and fabrics. A smaller trommel then allows the biodegraded soil fraction to pass through leaving non-biodegradable, recyclable materials on the screen to be collected. An electromagnet is used to remove the ferrous material from the waste mass as it passes along the conveyor belt. A front end loader is used to move sorted materials to trucks for further processing. Odor control sprayers are wheeled tractors with a cab and movable spray arm mounted on a rotating platform. A large reservoir tank mounted behind the cab holds neutralizing agents, usually in liquid form, to reduce the smell of exposed wastes. Depending on the level of resource recovery, material can be put through an air classifier which separates light organic material from heavy organic material. The separate streams are then loaded, by front end loaders, onto trucks either for further processing or for sale. Further manual processing can be done on site if processing facilities are too far away to justify the transportation costs.

Czacki played an important part in the Enlightenment in Poland. Biography Czacki was born in Poryck in Volhynia, Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, now Pavlivka in Ukraine. When Prince Adam Czartoryski was placed at the head of the educational district of Vilnius, Czacki was appointed school inspector of Volhynia, Podolia, and the Ukraine. An opponent of the Jesuits, he combated their work in the field of pedagogy, and on one occasion raised by public subscription the sum of two millions of Polish florins to insure the existence of the gymnasiums in Vinnitsa and Kiev. In 1805 he founded the high school in Kremenetz, Volhynia (the Liceum Krzemienieckie). After Czacki's death his heart was deposited in one of the halls of this Volhynian school, under the inscription \\"Ubi thesaurus tuus, ibi est cor tuum\\" (Where your treasury lies, there lies your heart). He discovered what was thought at the time to be the grave of Copernicus; however, controversy over its location continued long afterwards. He also was a panel member of the Komisja Edukacji Narodowej, founded by Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski in 1773 and considered to be the world's first ministry of education. From 1786 to 1792 he worked for the Polish Commission of the Treasury and was responsible for supervising Jewish affairs in the country. During this time and afterwards, he worked for the emancipation of Jews in Poland. Exemption from the poll-tax was granted in 1775 to those who would apply themselves to agriculture, and by 1787, owing to Czacki's efforts while in the treasury (see his report of 1787 on the Ruthenian and Ukrainian provinces), he had the satisfaction of seeing a few scores of families enjoying that privilege. Furthermore, he co-wrote the Constitution of 3 May 1791, and founded the Towarzystwo Przyjaci√≥≈Ç Nauk (Society of Friends of Science). In 1786 he was awarded the Order of Saint Stanislaus, and in 1792 the Order of the White Eagle. Writings Czacki's Rozprawa o Zydach (Discourse on the Jews), first published in Wilna 1807, and translated into Russian by Basil Anastaszewicz, passed through several editions, and was published finally in Dzie≈Ça Tadeusza Czackiego (Works of Tadeusz Czacki), edited by Edward Raczy≈Ñski, Posen, 1845 (iii. 138-270). For the history of the Jewish institutions, Czacki, who did not know Hebrew, availed himself of the only sources open to him; namely, Bartolocci and Ugolino. After relating the early history of the Jews, Czacki describes their situation among the Arabs, Italians, Spaniards, French, Germans, and Hungarians. He tells of their entrance into Poland in the twelfth century; of their intellectual condition; of their government and laws; and of the persecutions to which they were subjected. He also wrote a short discourse on the Karaites (Dzie≈Ça Tadeusza Czackiego, iii. 271-285) which attempts to explain, on the basis of the sources accessible to the author and referred to above, \\"what the Karaites are, and wherein they chiefly differ from other Jews; when their separation occurred; and in what countries they dwell.\\" Czacki's, who himself had been interested in Lithuanian language published a work on law in a two volumes About Lithuanian and Polish laws, their spirit, their origins and about things discussed in the first Lithuanian Statute of the year 1529 ,Full text of the work explaining differences of the two nations within the former Commonwealth.

Their music is characterized by the fusion of power and progressive metal, which made them the pioneers of the 'progressive power metal' subgenre. The band was plagued by a continuing changing roster, which counts in the current line-up only one founding member. Elegy have currently suspended any recording or live activity. History The band was formed in 1986 by guitarists Hank van de Laars and Arno van Brussel, who recruited the first stable line-up of Elegy with vocalist Chris Terheijden, bassist Martin Helmantel and Bert Burgers on drums. In 1986, the new band won a competition organized by the German magazine Metal Hammer and Polydor Records and recorded their first demo Metricide. After recording their second demo, Better Than Bells, the band had already become known enough to tour with Angel Witch, Paul Di'Anno‚Äôs Battlezone, Hellion and King Diamond. The following year came the first changes in the band: Ed Warby and Eduard Hovinga joined the band on drums and vocals. This line-up recorded a third demo called Elegant Solution. In 1992 they recorded their first album (Labyrinth of Dreams) and ensured a contract with the German label Shark Records. The album was a success in Japan where it reached number 42 in the album charts. Soon after the release of the album in 1993, Ed Warby left the band to join Gorefest and drummer Serge Meeuwsen was hired for a Japanese tour, along keyboard player Ton van de Stroom. Back from Japan, Meeuwsen, van de Stroom and founding member Arno van Brussel left Elegy, to be replaced by drummer Dirk Bruinenberg and guitarist Gilbert Pot. In the spring of 1994, Elegy released their second studio album, Supremacy, which received little promotion by their record label and was supported only by a small tour with Annihilator, Phantom Blue, The Gathering and Gorefest. In the summer of 1995, the album Lost is presented to the public, with new keyboard player Gerrit Hager. But shortly before going on tour with Yngwie Malmsteen, Hovinga, Pot and Hager left the band. At the same the German record company Modern Music, home of T&T; and Noise Records, offered the band a lucrative contract. The following year, vocalist Ian Parry (ex-Hammerhead) joined the band and recorded the EP Primal Instinct, which contains acoustic versions of old Elegy songs. The album State of Mind saw the light in May 1997 with good reviews and sales, both in Europe and Japan. Elegy went on a European tour with the Finnish band Stratovarius to support the new album. Chris Allister joined on keyboards for the concept album Manifestation of Fear, released in the summer of 1998. The band co-headlined a European tour with American power metal band Kamelot the same year. After the tour in 1999, Parry started his side-project Consortium with Bruinenberg on drums. At the end of the year founding member Henk van de Laars and Chris Allister left Elegy. French guitar virtuoso Patrick Rondat joined the band during the same year and recorded Elegy's eight album Forbidden Fruit, released on September 18, 2000 and well received by critics. Forbidden Fruit was the last album released for Modern Music, leaving the band without a recording contract for more than a year. Meanwhile, the band members worked on side-projects or as touring and session musicians Two years later Elegy released Principles of Pain with the Spanish label Locomotive Records. Since then the band have not published any more albums and is currently on hiatus. Ian Parry said in a 2012 interview that he would like to make one more Elegy album, if a record company would be prepared to invest in it. Guitar Player Henk van der Laars wrote an album full of songs but more effort is needed to get it ready.

Evans is an author in the emerging genre of Australian political and parliamentary thriller, with his first fiction novel ‚Äì Deceit ‚Äì published in July 2018. Evans served as a Liberal Party of Australia member in the Australian House of Representatives. He was the member for Cowan from 1993 to 1998. From the late 1970s, Evans forged a successful career as a corporate executive and has led several national industry associations. He has served as the CEO of the Franchise Council of Australia, Executive Director of the Australian Retailers Association, Executive Director of Clubs Victoria and the Council of Textile and Fashion Industries Australia. In 2005 he graduated Bachelor of Arts and in 2012 graduated Masters of Creative Writing.  Early life  Evans, the second of two sons, was born in Melbourne, Victoria, to Rena (n√©e Haworth) and Robert Evans. Robert Evans (21 October 1926 ‚Äì 30 May 1996) served in the Australian Air Force during World War 2, and worked as an upholsterer for the government railways, an experimental trimmer for Volkswagen, and a planning technician for Olympic Tyres. Robert Evans was the Victorian Commissioner for Scouts and contributed significantly to that organisation in a variety of leadership roles. Rena Evans (17 March 1926 ‚Äì 8 August 2014) was a retailer and chef's executive manager at the Victorian Royal Melbourne Hospital. Richard Evans grew up in Williamstown, Victoria; attended the local primary and secondary schools, leaving school at 16 years of age. Evans started working in various retail outlets, pumped petrol and delivered pharmacy prescriptions when still at school. At 16, Evans took a job as an apprentice within the printing industry, working in newspapers and graphic arts. Soon after completing his four-year apprenticeship, he moved into the hospitality industry and promoted to management roles with Lazars and at the Melbourne Hilton. As a teenager and young adult, he was a skilled sportsman and won many events and tournaments in track and field athletics and badminton. He played semi-professional Australian Rules football for the Williamstown Football Club, before moving to Western Australia as a senior player for the Subiaco Football Club.  Business career  Evans moved to Perth, Western Australia in 1976 to play Australian Rules Football and was employed in media management. He was appointed Advertising Manager with Wesfarmers‚Äô newspaper, Western Farmer and Grazier at 26 years of age before moving into property management with LJ Hooker Real Estate. At 30 years of age, Evans was appointed Regional General Manager of an outdoor advertising manufacturing company (a subsidiary of the Griffin Group), before being promoted and relocating to their head office in Sydney, New South Wales. In 1989, demands of a young family facilitated a move back to Perth, where he established a highly successful management consultancy specialising in productivity training, and workplace health and safety investigations. During his time in Perth, Evans was highly active with state and national industry groups and was a Councilor of the Western Australian Chamber of Commerce. In 2002, Evans was appointed Executive Director of the Franchise Council of Australia and helped reshape the governance and compliance practices of this highly regulated sector. In 2007 he was appointed the Executive Director of the Australian Retailers Association. He has also served as Executive Director of the Council of Textile and Fashion Industries Australia and Clubs Victoria. In these roles, he represented these organisations at productivity commission hearings, various government task forces and consultations, regulatory body advisory groups, industry forums and legislative advisory boards. He has presented at many national and international universities on business, advocacy, and political practices in regulated industries. Evans also represented Australia on a number of international industry bodies, trade delegations, and was a regular presenter at international industry expos and conferences. He served as the Communications Director on the World Franchise Council, Education Director with the Asia Pacific Franchise Confederation, and was appointed as the Australian franchise sector representative on the government Joint Trade Committee with Malaysia. Evans continues to serve, and consult to, peak industry associations and not-for-profit organisations. He is the founder and senior partner of the MALThouse Group, a firm providing strategic, governance, and advocacy services to member-based organisations. He is the creator of the AMENO Principle, a model for increasing an organisation's reputation and relevance, and the small business coaching program Latte Leadership He is often engaged as a key note speaker on business strategy, leadership, and political advocacy.  Politics  Evans entered politics with clear intentions to make a difference in policy areas he specialised ‚Äì small business, industry representation, and community relations. He was nominated for pre-selection to stand as the Liberal Party representative in the 1993 election for the federal Western Australian seat of Cowan. He won the seat, being the first Liberal candidate to do so. In 1993, Evans was an opposition backbencher when the Australian Labor Party was in government, led by Prime Minister, Paul Keating. In his first term as a backbencher, Evans raised policy issues including breast cancer research funding, improved environment awareness for natural fauna, and worked with Indigenous policy. He was reelected in 1996, with the Liberal Party winning majority and forming government under Prime Minister John Howard. In his second term, Evans gained international recognition for his stance on feral cat management, raised awareness on the need to rethink disability policy, and gained recognition for bringing improved constituent management practices to politicians. He was a member of a parliamentary inquiry into franchise business practices and regulations which lead to significant changes to Australian trade practice legislation that introduced the world first mandatory Code of Conduct for Franchising. He won high praise for his work in the environment, specifically protecting native fauna from feral cats which led, in time, with the implementation of a coordinated national approach to ethically managing feral cats in 2014. Evans stood for reelection in 1998 but lost his seat to a high-profile former state parliament minister.  Political parody  In popular culture, Evans‚Äô political career and stance on key issues has been parodied by actor Eric Bana in a segment from Australian comedy show Full Frontal'‚Äô (October 1996) and he was included in a 2013 segment by John Oliver on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart‚Äô' on gun control in the U.S. versus Australia.  Author  Evans was first encouraged to write on a visit to the Republican Convention in San Diego in 1996, when he met Norman Mailer at Dobson's Bar. All of Evans‚Äô political thrillers are set in and around the workings of the national Commonwealth Parliament of Australia. Evans brings his unique insider view of not only how the Australian political system operates, the untold stories of power and manipulation of perceptions, but also provides a visual on the physical environment of Australia's Parliament House. Politics, as a genre, provides a rich tapestry of characters all working their self-interest and power and with contemporary and historical consequences of their actions.  The Democracy Trilogy  Evans took three years to complete the first book of his Australian political thriller series ‚Äì The Democracy Trilogy. The trilogy, told in three episodes, is a snap shot over three years of power and how its misuse corrupts even the most ethical. Book one, Deceit (forthcoming, 2018) begins with a plane crash that starts a sequence of events which leads corrupt Prime Minister Andrew Gerrard to rush through legislation designed to secure his ill-gotten gains after a long political career. Stalwart ‚Äì and soon to be retired ‚Äì Clerk of the Commonwealth Parliament, Gordon O‚ÄôBrien, reluctantly sets out to foil the Prime Minister's plan with the help of an investigative journalist. Deceit will be published in July 2018 by Sydney-based independent publisher Ventura Press‚Äô imprint Impact Press. Before Evans completed Deceit, he began work on episode two of the Democracy Trilogy, Duplicity (forthcoming, 2019), The sequel centres on an unexpected national election, encouraged by a business group who appoint a covert campaign operative to manipulate the election result and ensure the Prime Minister Gerrard is defeated.  The Referendum Series  Also in production is the Referendum Series where each book focuses on an issue confounding the Australian public which is sent to referendum, to approve amending, or not, Australia's Constitution. Book one of this series, Forgotten People (forthcoming, 2019) has Indigenous leader Nellie Millergoorra fight for Australia's improved treatment and engagement with the world's longest continuing culture. The second book ‚Äì Kill Bill, Is Life Worth Saving? (forthcoming, 2019) ‚Äì is on the federal government's referendum bill to legalise euthanasia, the separation of Church and State, and the personal conflict faced by the Attorney General in response to his daughter's recent coma.  Jack Hudson Series  The Jack Hudson Series provides a first- person view about the daily personal struggles of a federal minister in the Australian parliament. The series is a semi-autobiographical account based on the challenges Evans faced in his political career and advocacy experience. Book one of the series Selfish Ambitions (forthcoming, 2020) has federal Minister of Industry Jack Hudson resisting the demands of his Prime Minister and the ever-increasing angst of his career leading him to make a decision which will change everything. The second book is Horrible People (forthcoming, 2020) where Jack Hudson becomes embroiled in an international diplomatic incident whilst holidaying with his family overseas.  Other publications  Evans completed his first manuscript, Out of my Hands (unpublished, 1999). The story addressed the issue of rape, murder, capital punishment and the failings of a legal system that condemns an innocent man. His first published business publication is the high selling Australian Franchising Handbook (Wrightbooks, 2006), a practical pre-entry education guide for prospective franchise business owners. It was a timely publication, reinforcing compliance requirements and standards expected of franchisors and service providers.  Education  In 2005 he graduated Bachelor of Arts (majoring in industrial relations and English), from The University of Western Australia and in 2012 graduated Masters of Creative Writing from the University of Canberra. He also completed a diploma of business and is a certified mediator.  Personal life  Evans married Dr. Julia Camm on 2 October 2010. The couple live in the historic bayside village of Williamstown, a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria. Evans has three children from a previous marriage.

They are also known collectively as the Monmouthshire Levels or Gwent Levels, Historic Landscape Characterisation: The Gwent Levels and the name Wentloog is sometimes spelled Wentlooge in official publications. The Caldicot Level lies to the southeast of Newport between the River Usk and River Wye and consists of . It is home to Newport Wetlands Reserve. The Wentloog Level lies to the southwest between the River Usk and Rhymney River and consists of . The levels are formed from tidal deposits and alluvium, which have been recurrently inundated and reclaimed from the Severn Estuary by humans since Roman times. They have been patterns of settlement, enclosure and drainage systems belonging to successive periods of use, and are extremely rich archaeologically, with finds from the Mesolithic, Bronze Age and Iron Age periods. They are an important wetland resource. Parts have been designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest. They are registered as a Historic Landscape of Outstanding Historic Interest in Wales.Gwent Levels ‚Äì Historic Landscape Characterisation  History and archaeology  There have been variations in both land and sea levels in the Severn Estuary since the start of human habitation in the area. The Levels have been reclaimed from the sea at different times during the historic period, preserving evidence of patterns of settlement, enclosure and drainage systems.Bell, M., Caseldine, A. and Neumann, H. (2000). Prehistoric Intertidal Archaeology in the Welsh Severn Estuary, CBA Research Report 120 Mesolithic and later remains have been discovered at Goldcliff, and late Mesolithic human footprints at Uskmouth. One of the most significant finds was of a 3rd-century Romano-British boat found at Wilcrick near Magor. The Romans occupied the area from the 2nd to the 4th centuries. In 1878, a boundary stone marking the building of 33 paces of embankment by Roman soldiers was discovered at Goldcliff. Research suggests that, initially, reclamation of the natural salt marsh for farmland began at a few \\"island\\" sites within the marshes, such as at Nash and Redwick, before a sea wall was built along the whole coast.Stephen Rippon, The Historic Landscapes of the Severn Estuary, Archaeology in the Severn Estuary, 11 (2000), 1, pp 9‚Äì35. Goldcliff Priory was established in 1113 and together with other major landowners took responsibility for further drainage work in the area. Settlements became established, linked by droveways such as the Whitewall at Magor, and land was gradually reclaimed for pasture and arable use. A large number of Anglo-Norman sites including castles, churches, court houses, manor houses, moated sites and watermills show near- continuous occupation throughout the Middle Ages. The Bristol Channel floods of 30 January 1607 (New style), caused by either a storm surge or a tsunami, resulted in the drowning of an estimated 2,000 people, with houses and villages swept away, an estimated of farmland inundated and livestock destroyed. This was one of the worst natural disasters recorded in Britain. Drainage and management Most of the levels has been the subject of artificial drainage schemes, and the area is criss-crossed by drainage channels, known locally as 'reens'.Geograph photos of Reens in the Levels Many of these are now managed by the Caldicot and Wentlooge Levels Internal Drainage Board. In 1531, Henry VIII set up Courts of Sewers to improve drainage, but without any powers to oblige landowners to carry out work. In 1884, the Caldicot and Wentlooge Level Act established a new body, the Monmouthshire Commissioners of Sewers, with responsibility for maintaining sea walls and roads in the Levels. The long title of the Act is \\"An Act to provide for the commutation of the liability of Landowners in the Levels of the hundreds of Caldicot and Wentlooge in the County of Monmouth to maintain sea walls and other works to provide for the making and maintaining of roads in the said Levels and for other purposes.\\" This was superseded in 1942 by the Caldicot and Wentlooge Levels Drainage Board, now the Internal Drainage Board or IDB.Caldicot & Wentlooge Levels Internal Drainage Board Website In 2012, the IDB was criticised in a report by the Wales Audit Office for overpaying staff, paying for trips abroad for its members, and acting unlawfully on other occasions. The IDB accepted the report and stated that the organisation's management had changed substantially since the time of the offences.

In the 6th century, the G√∂kt√ºrks overthrew the Rouran Khaganate in what is now Mongolia and expanded in all directions, spreading Turkic culture throughout the Eurasian steppes. Although G√∂kt√ºrk empires came to an end in the 8th century, they were succeeded by numerous Turkic empires such as the Uyghur Khaganate, Kara-Khanid Khanate, Khazars, and the Cumans. Some Turks eventually settled down into a sedentary society such as the Qocho and Ganzhou Uyghurs. The Seljuq dynasty settled in Anatolia starting in the 11th century, resulting in permanent Turkic settlement and presence there. Modern nations with large Turkic populations include Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, and Turkic populations also exist within other nations, such as Chuvashia, Bashkortostan, Tatarstan, the Crimean Tatars, the Uyghurs in China, and the Sakha Republic Siberia. Origin theories Hunnic Empire of about AD 450 as seen by European authors. The star marks where the nomadic Huns chose to encamp, the Hungarian plain, a sort of enclave of steppe country in a mountainous region. Proposals for the homeland of the Turkic peoples and their language are far-ranging, from the Transcaspian steppe to Northeastern Asia (Manchuria). According to Yunusbayev et al. (2015), genetic evidence points to an origin in the region near South Siberia and Mongolia as the \\"Inner Asian Homeland\\" of the Turkic ethnicity. Similarly several linguists, including Juha Janhunen, Roger Blench and Matthew Spriggs, suggest that Mongolia is the homeland of the early Turkic language. According to Robbeets, the Turkic people descend from people who lived in a region extending from present-day South Siberia and Mongolia to the West Liao River Basin (modern Manchuria). Authors Joo-Yup Lee and Shuntu Kuang analyzed 10 years of genetic research on Turkic people and compiled scholarly information about Turkic origins, and said that the early and medieval Turks were a heterogeneous group and that the Turkification of Eurasia was a result of language diffusion, not a migration of a homogeneous population. Hunnic theory The Huns were a nomadic people who lived in Central Asia, the Caucasus, and Eastern Europe, between the 4th and 6th century AD. According to European tradition, they were first reported living east of the Volga River, in an area that was part of Scythia at the time; the Huns' arrival is associated with the migration westward of an Indo-Iranian people, the Alans. The Huns have often been considered a Turkic people, and sometimes associated with the Xiongnu. While in Europe, the Huns incorporated others, such as Goths, Slavs, and Alans. The Huns were not literate (according to ProcopiusMaenchen-Helfen (1973) page 376.) and left nothing linguistic with which to identify them except their names, which derive from Germanic, Iranian, Turkic, unknown and a mixture.Maenchen-Helfen (1973) pages 441‚Äì442. Some, such as Ultinƒçur and Alpilƒçur, are like Turkish names ending in -ƒçor, Pecheneg names in -tzour and Kirghiz names in -ƒçoro. Names ending in -gur, such as Utigur and Onogur, and -gir, such as Ultingir, are like Turkish names of the same endings. The actual identity of the Huns is still debated. Concerning the cultural genesis of the Huns, the Cambridge Ancient History of China asserts: \\"Beginning in about the eighth century BC, throughout inner Asia horse-riding pastoral communities appeared, giving origin to warrior societies.\\" These were part of a larger belt of \\"equestrian pastoral peoples\\" stretching from the Black Sea to Mongolia, and known to the Greeks as the Scythians.  G√∂kt√ºrk wave (5th-8th c.) The First Turkic Khaganate in 568 Tang campaigns against the Western Turks Tiele and Turk The earliest Turks mentioned in textual sources are the Tiele people (ÈêµÂãí), a transcription of the endonym *Tegreg \\"[People of the] Carts\\", recorded by the Chinese in the 6th century. According to the New Book of Tang, Tiele is just a mistaken form of Chile/Gaoche, who themselves are just the Xiongnu branch of the Dingling people. Many scholars believe the Di, Dili, Dingling, and later Tujue mentioned in textual sources are all just Chinese transcriptions of the same Turkic word. The first reference to T√ºrk or T√ºrk√ºt appears in 6th century Chinese sources as the transcription T≈´ju√© (Á™ÅÂé•). The earliest evidence of Turkic languages and the use of \\"Turk\\" as an endonym comes from the Orkhon inscriptions of the G√∂kt√ºrks () in the early 8th century. Many groups speaking 'Turkic' languages never adopted the name \\"Turk\\" for their own identity. Among the peoples that came under G√∂kt√ºrk dominance and adopted its political culture and lingua-franca, the name \\"Turk\\" wasn't always the preferred identity. Turk therefore did not apply to all Turkic peoples at the time, but only referred to the Eastern Turkic Khaganate, while the Western Turkic Khaganate and Tiele used their own tribal names. Of the Tiele, the Book of Sui mentions only tribes which were not part a part of the First Turkic Khaganate. There wasn't a unified expansion of Turkic tribes. Peripheral Turkic peoples in the G√∂kt√ºrk Empire like the Bulgars and even central ones like the Oghuz and Karluks migrated autonomously with migrating traders, soldiers and townspeople. The precise date of the initial expansion from the early homeland remains unknown. The first state known as \\"Turk\\", giving its name to the many states and peoples afterwards, was that of the G√∂kt√ºrks (g√∂k = 'blue' or 'celestial', however in this context \\"g√∂k\\" refers to the direction \\"east\\". Therefore, Gokturks are the Eastern Turks) in the 6th century. In 439, the head of the Ashina clan led his people from Lijian (modern Zhelaizhai) to the Rouran seeking inclusion in their confederacy and protection from China. His tribe consisted of famed metal smiths and was granted land near a mountain quarry that looked like a helmet, from which they got their name Turk/Tujue Á™ÅÂé•. In 546, the leader of the Ashina, Bumin, aided the Rouran in putting down a Tiele revolt. Bumin requested a Rouran princess for his service but was denied, after which he declared independence. In 551, Bumin declared himself Khagan and married Princess Changle from Western Wei. He then dealt a serious blow to the Rouran Khaganate the next year, but died soon after. His sons, Issik Qaghan and Muqan Qaghan, continued to wage war on the Rouran, finishing them off in 554. By 568, their territory had reached the edges of the Byzantine Empire, where the Avars, possibly related to the Rouran in some fashion, escaped. Gao Yang, \\"The Origin of the Turks and the Turkish Khanate\\", X. T√ºrk Tarih Kongresi: Ankara 22 ‚Äì 26 Eyl√ºl 1986, Kongreye Sunulan Bildiriler, V. Cilt, T√ºrk Tarih Kurumu, 1991, s. 731. In 581, Taspar Qaghan died and the khaganate entered a civil war that resulted in two separate Turkic factions. The Eastern Khaganate was defeated by the Tang dynasty in 630 while the Western Khaganate fell to the Tang in 657. In 682, Ilterish Qaghan rebelled against the Tang and founded the Second Turkic Khaganate, which fell to the Uyghurs in 744. Bulgar The migration of the Bulgars after the fall of Old Great Bulgaria in the 7th century. The Bulgars, also known as the Onogur-Bulgars or Onogundurs, arrived in the Kuban steppe zone sometime during the 5th century. By the 7th century, they were under the rule of the Avars, who they revolted against in 635 under the leadership of Kubrat. Prior to this, Kubrat had made an alliance with Heraclius of the Byzantine Empire. He was baptized in 619. Kubrat died in the 660s and his territory, Old Great Bulgaria, was divided between his sons. Two of them were incorporated by the Khazars, one headed to Pannonia, and one became a subject of the Byzantines. The Bulgars in Pannonia revolted against the Pannonian Avars and migrated to Thessalonika by 679. There they formed the First Bulgarian Empire. Khazar The origin of the Khazars is unclear. Some believe they were originally part of the Uyghurs, some of whom migrated west prior to 555. According to Al-Masudi, the Khazars were called Sabirs in Turkic. Some believe the Khazars were founded by Irbis Seguy, the penultimate ruler of the Western Turkic Khaganate, since the Hudud al-'Alam says the Khazar king descended from the Ansa, which has been interpreted as Ashina. By the mid-7th century, the Khazars were located in the North Caucasus, where they fought against the Umayyads constantly. Kyrgyz According to the Book of Tang, the Yenisei Kyrgyz were tall, red haired, blue eyed, and had ruddy faces. It also notes that Kyrgyz women outnumbered men, both men and women wore tattoos, and they made weapons which they gave to the Turks. They practiced agriculture but did not grow fruits. The Kyrgyz lived west of Lake Baikal and east of the Karluks. According to the Book of Sui, the Kyrgyz chaffed at the domination of the First Turkic Khaganate. The Uyghur Khaganate also made war on the Kyrgyz and cut them off from trade with China, which the Uyghurs monopolized. As a result, the Kyrgyz turned to other channels of trade such as with the Tibetans, Arabs, and Karluks. From 820 onward, the Kyrgyz were constantly at war with the Uyghurs, until 840, when the Uyghur Khaganate was dismantled. Although the Kyrgyz managed to occupy some of the Uyghur land, they had no great effect on the geopolitical configuration around them. The Chinese paid no heed to them other than to award them with some titles and reasoned that since the Uyghurs were no longer in power, there was no reason to maintain relations with the Kyrgyz any longer. The Kyrgyz themselves seemed to lack any interest in occupying the former territory of the Uyghurs in the east. By 924, the Khitans had occupied Otuken in the territory of the former Uyghur Khaganate. Turgesh In 699, the Turgesh ruler Wuzhile founded a khaganate stretching from Chach to Beshbalik. He and his successor Saqal campaigned against the Tang dynasty and their Turkic allies until 711, when the resurgent Second Turkic Khaganate crushed the Turgesh in battle. Turgesh remnants under Suluk re-established themselves in Zhetysu. Suluk was killed by one of his subordinates in 737 after he was defeated by the Umayyads. The Tang took advantage of the situation to invade Turgesh territory and took the city of Suyab. In the 760s, the Karluks drove out the Turgesh. Karluk Kara- Khanid Khanate in 1006 The Karluks, who take their name from the Turkic word for snow, migrated into the area of Tokharistan as early as the 7th century. In 744, they participated in the Uyghur Khaganate's rise by overthrowing the Second Turkic Khaganate, but conflict with the Uyghurs forced them to migrate further west into Zhetysu. By 766, they had pushed out the Turgesh and took the Western Turkic capital of Suyab. Islam began spreading in the Karluk tribes during the 9th century. According to the Hudud al-'Alam, written in the 10th century, the Karluks were pleasant nearly civilized people who participated in agriculture as well as herding and hunting. Al-Masudi considered the Karluks to be the most beautiful people among the Turks, being tall in stature, and lordly in appearance. By the 11th century, they had integrated a considerable number of Sogdians into their population, resulting in speech that to Mahmud al-Kashgari, sounded slurred. The Karluks, Chigils, and Yagmas formed the Kara-Khanid Khanate in the 9th century, but it's unclear whether the leadership of the new polity fell to the Karluks or the Yagmas. Pecheneg According to the Book of Sui (7th century), the Pechenegs, known as the Beiru, lived among the Tiele and were neighbors of the Onoƒüurs and Alans in the steppes of modern Kazakhstan and the North Caucasus. An 8th century Tibetan translation of a Uyghur account says the Pechenegs warred with the Hephthalites. The Pecheneg tribes were possibly related to the Kankalis. In the late 9th century, conflict with the Khazars drove the Pechenegs into the Pontic steppes. In the 10th century they had substantial interactions with the Byzantine Empire, who depended on them for keeping control of their neighbors. Byzantine and Muslim sources confirm that the Pechenegs had a leader, but the position was not passed down from father to son. In the 10th century, the Pechenegs came into military conflict with the Rus', and in the early 11th century, military conflict with the Oghuz Turks drove them further west across the Danube into Byzantine territory. Uyghur wave (8th-9th c.)=Oghuz The Oghuz Yabgu State c.750 The Oghuz Turks take their name from the Turkic word for \\"clan\\", \\"tribe\\", or \\"kinship\\". As such, Oghuz is a common appellation for many Turkic groups, such as the Toquz Oghuz (nine tribes), Sekiz Oghuz (eight tribes), and Uch Oghuz (three tribes). Oghuz has been used to refer to many different Turkic tribes, causing much confusion. For example, the ruler of the Oghuz was called the Toquz Khagan, even though there were 12 tribes instead of nine. It's not certain if the Oghuz Turks were directly descended from the Toquz Oghuz. They may have been under the direct leadership of the Toquz at some point, but by the 11th century, the Oghuz were already linguistically distinct from their neighbors such as the Kipchaks and Karakhanids. The Oghuz migration westward began with the fall of the Second Turkic Khaganate and rise of the Uyghur Khaganate in 744. Under Uyghur rule, the Oghuz leader obtained the title of \\"right yabgu\\". When they appeared in Muslim textual sources in the 9th century, they were described using the same title. The Oghuz fought a series of wars with the Pechenegs, Khalaj, Charuk, and Khazars for the steppes, emerging victorious and establishing the Oghuz Yabgu State. The Oghuz were in constant conflict with the Pechenegs and Khazars throughout the 10th century, as recorded by Muslim texts, but they also cooperated at times. In one instance, the Khazars hired the Oghuz to fight off an attack by the Alans. In 965, the Oghuz took part in a Rus' attack on the Khazars and in 985 they joined the Rus' again in attacking Volga Bulgaria. The Yabgu State of the Oghuz did not have a central leadership and there is no evidence of the Yabgu acting as a spokesman for the entire Oghuz people. By the 10th century, some Oghuz had settled in towns and converted to Islam, although many tribes still followed Tengrism. Cuman Kipchak The relationship and origins of the Cumans and Kipchaks is uncertain. They are sometimes considered the same people by different names: they were called Cumans in the West and Kipchaks in the East. The earliest mention of them comes from an inscription of Bayanchur Khan of the Uyghur Khaganate, which mentions the Turk-Kipchak. According to Rashid al-Din Hamadani, writing much later in the Ilkhanate, Kipchak is derived from a Turkic word which means \\"hollow rotted out tree\\". Cuman may be derived from the Turkic word qun, which means \\"pale\\" or \\"yellow\\". Some scholars associate the Cuman Kipchaks with the Kankalis. The Kipchaks were next mentioned in the 9th century by Ibn Khordadbeh, who placed them next to the Toquz Oghuz, while Al-Biruni claimed that the Qun were further east of them. Habash al-Hasib al-Marwazi writes that the Qun came from the lands of Cathay which they fled from in fear of the Khitans. This may have been what the Armenian chronicler Matthew of Edessa was referring to when he recounted Pale Ones being driven out by the people of the Snakes. Kimek In the mid-9th century, the Kimeks emerged in the northern steppes stretching from Lake Balkhash in the east to the Aral Sea in the west. They were originally a minor tribe who held the title of \\"Shad Tutuk\\", derived from the Chinese military title \\"Dudu\\", but started using the title of \\"Yabgu\\" instead when remnants of the Uyghur Khaganate fled to them in 840. By the early 10th century, the Kimeks bordered the Oghuz to the south, where the Ural formed the boundary. According to the Hudud al-'Alam, written in the 10th century, the Kimeks used the title of Khagan. They were the most removed from sedentary civilization of all the Turks and had only one town within their territory. In the 11th century, the Kimeks were displaced by the Cumans. Later Turkic peoples Uyghur Khaganate in geopolitical context c. AD 800 The Pontic steppes, Cuman‚ÄìKipchak confederation in Eurasia circa 1200 Later Turkic peoples include the Khazars, Turkmens: either Karluks (mainly 8th century) or Oghuz Turks, Uyghurs, Yenisei Kyrgyz, Pechenegs, Cumans-Kipchaks, etc. As these peoples were founding states in the area between Mongolia and Transoxiana, they came into contact with Muslims, and most gradually adopted Islam. However, there were also some other groups of Turkic people who belonged to other religions, including Christians, Judaists, Buddhists, Manichaeans, and Zoroastrians. Turkmens While the Karakhanid state remained in this territory until its conquest by Genghis Khan, the Turkmen group of tribes was formed around the core of westward Oghuz. The name \\"Turkmen\\" originally simply meant \\"I am Turk\\" in the language of the diverse tribes living between the Karakhanid and Samanid states. Thus, the ethnic consciousness among some, but not all Turkic tribes as \\"Turkmens\\" in the Islamic era came long after the fall of the non-Muslim Gokturk (and Eastern and Western) Khanates. The name \\"Turk\\" in the Islamic era became an identity that grouped Islamized Turkic tribes in contradistinction to Turkic tribes that were not Muslim (that mostly have been referred to as \\"Tatar\\"), such as the Nestorian Naiman (which became a major founding stock for the Muslim Kazakh nation) and Buddhist Tuvans. Thus the ethnonym \\"Turk\\" for the diverse Islamized Turkic tribes somehow served the same function as the name \\"Tajik\\" did for the diverse Iranian peoples who converted to Islam and adopted Persian as their lingua-franca. Both names first and foremost labeled Muslimness, and to a lesser extent, common language and ethnic culture. Long after the departure of the Turkmens from Transoxiana towards the Karakum and Caucasus, consciousness associated with the name \\"Turk\\" still remained, as Chagatay and Timurid period Central Asia was called \\"Turkestan\\" and the Chagatay language called \\"Turki\\", even though the people only referred to themselves as \\"Mughals\\", \\"Sarts\\", \\"Taranchis\\" and \\"Tajiks\\". This name \\"Turk\\", was not commonly used by most groups of the Kypchak branch, such as the Kazakhs, although they are closely related to the Oghuz (Turkmens) and Karluks (Karakhanids, Sarts, Uyghurs). Neither did Bulgars (Kazan Tatars, Chuvash) and non-Muslim Turkic groups (Tuvans, Yakuts, Yugurs) come close to adopting the ethnonym \\"Turk\\" in its Islamic Era sense. Among the Karakhanid period Turkmen tribes rose the Atabeg Seljuq of the Kinik tribe, whose dynasty grew into a great Islamic empire stretching from India to Anatolia. Turkic soldiers in the army of the Abbasid caliphs emerged as the de facto rulers of much of the Muslim Middle East (apart from Syria and North Africa) from the 13th century. The Oghuz and other tribes captured and dominated various countries under the leadership of the Seljuk dynasty, and eventually captured the territories of the Abbasid dynasty and the Byzantine Empire. Meanwhile, the Kyrgyz and Uyghurs were struggling with one another and with the Chinese Empire. The Kyrgyz people ultimately settled in the region now referred to as Kyrgyzstan. The Batu hordes conquered the Volga Bulgars in what is today Tatarstan and Kypchaks in what is now Southern Russia, following the westward sweep of the Mongols in the 13th century. Other Bulgars settled in Europe in the 7-8th centuries, but were assimilated by the Slavs, giving the name to the Bulgarians and the Slavic Bulgarian language. It was under Seljuq suzerainty that numerous Turkmen tribes, especially those that came through the Caucasus via Azerbaijan, acquired fiefdoms (beyliks) in newly conquered areas of Anatolia, Iraq and even the Levant. Thus, the ancestors of the founding stock of the modern Turkish nation were most closely related to the Oghuz Turkmen groups that settled in the Caucasus and later became the Azerbaijani nation. By early modern times, the name \\"Turkestan\\" has several definitions: # land of sedentary Turkic-speaking townspeople that have been subjects of the Central Asian Chagatayids, i.e. Sarts, Central Asian Mughals, Central Asian Timurids, Taranchi of Chinese Turkestan, and the later invading East Kipchak Tatars who mixed with local Sarts and Chagatais to form the Uzbeks; This area roughly coincides with \\"Khorasan\\" in the widest sense, plus Tarim Basin which was known as Chinese Turkestan. It is ethnically diverse, and includes homelands of non-Turkic peoples like the Tajiks, Pashtuns, Hazaras, Dungans, Dzungars. Turkic peoples of the Kypchak branch, i.e. Kazakhs and Kyrgyz, are not normally considered \\"Turkestanis\\" but are also populous (as pastoralists) in many parts of Turkestan. # a specific district governed by a 17th-century Kazakh Khan, in modern-day Kazakhstan, which were more sedentary than other Kazakh areas, and were populated by towns-dwelling Sarts See also *Migration Period *Nomadic empire *Eurasian nomads *Turkic tribal confederations *History of Central Asia *Hephthalites *Xionites *Tatar invasions *Ottoman Empire  References = Citations  Sources  Findley, Carter Vaughnm, The Turks in World History, Oxford University Press: Oxford (2005).

Based on the Neil Simon's Broadway play of the same name, the series cast members are predominantly black, making it the first American television sitcom since Amos 'n' Andy to have a predominantly black cast (Vito Scotti is the sole major white character). Barefoot in the Park had been a 1967 film starring Robert Redford and Jane Fonda. Synopsis Scoey Mitchell plays Paul Bratter, a newlywed attorney for the law firm Kendricks, Keene & Klein living in lower Manhattan with his wife Corie (played by Tracy Reed). The show was a slice-of- life comedy about surviving in New York City. Other regulars included Thelma Carpenter as Corie's mother, Mable Bates, Harry Holcombe as Mr. Kendricks, Vito Scotti as Mr. Velasquez, and Nipsey Russell as local pool hall owner, Honey Robinson. Guest stars Dead End Kids alumnus Huntz Hall and actor Jackie Coogan appeared on the 10th episode, aired December 3, 1970, titled Disorder in the Court (which gets its title from the 1936 Three Stooges short). Penny Marshall made one of her early television appearances on the fourth episode of the series, aired October 5, 1970, titled \\"In Sickness and in Health\\". Marshall's later co-star of the mid-1970s television success Laverne & Shirley, Cindy Williams, appeared on the sixth episode, which aired on October 29, 1970, titled \\"The Marriage Proposal\\". Cancellation When Barefoot in The Park premiered on Thursday, September 24, 1970, at 9 p.m., it was the lead-in program for another series based on a Neil Simon play, The Odd Couple, which debuted immediately afterward. Because both comedies followed ABC‚Äôs popular series Bewitched, which aired the same evening at 8:30 p.m., it was hoped that the long-running sitcom would provide a strong ratings segue for both series. However, Bewitched was in its seventh season and experiencing a ratings slump. As a result, viewership for both Barefoot in the Park and The Odd Couple was disappointing. In the case of Barefoot in the Park, there was also behind-the-scenes strife. Star Scoey Mitchell was fired due to \\"differences of opinion\\" with the series' producers. By this time, only 12 episodes of the sitcom had been produced. Rather than replace Mitchell with another actor and disenchanted with the low ratings, ABC decided to cancel Barefoot in the Park in December, 1970. In January 1971, the network moved The Odd Couple to Friday nights where its ratings improved. Despite the fact that it never placed in the top 30 television shows, The Odd Couple had a five-year run on ABC and won Emmy Awards for its two stars Tony Randall and Jack Klugman. The installments of Barefoot in the Park were rerun as episodes of Love, American Style in syndication. Production notes The show was produced by William P. D'Angelo, and various episodes were written or directed by much of the same team that had developed The Odd Couple (Jerry Paris, Harvey Miller, Bruce Bilson and Garry Marshall). Director Charles Rondeau also had directed almost the entire first half of the first season of the American sitcom F-Troop, which also aired on ABC.

The larvae of these small flies are active and predatory and are often used for biological control of aphids, scale insects, and similar pests. Chamaemyiid fossils are poorly represented in amber deposits, but a few examples are known from the Eocene epoch onwards. Morphological details of the Chamaemyiidae Description For terms, see Morphology of Diptera The Chamaemyiidae are small flies 9 (1‚Äì5 mm), usually greyish in colour. The frons is wide, with at most two pairs of bristles (often bare). The face is gently concave or strongly receding. Oral vibrissae are absent and the postvertical bristles are convergent or absent. The proboscis is short and the antennae are short. The mesonotum is with or without bristles. Prothoracic bristles are absent and with one sternopleural bristle. The mesopleura are usually bare, rarely setulose. The front femora bear bristles. The tibiae are without preapical bristles. Wings with the subcosta are entire, sometimes touching the first vein before its end. The anal vein does not reach nearly to the wing margin, the anal and second basal cells are always complete, and the costa is not broken. The abdomen is short or slightly elongated.

Unlike most pre-existing stations on Line 1 which opened with the collocated Gyeongbu Line in 1905, Songtan Station was built during the Korean War in 1952 to handle track switching for branch lines leading to the nearby newly built Osan Air Base. After the war, the Bidulgi class of commuter trains began to call on Songtan Station, but these were phased out in the 1990s. In 2005, Line 1 was extended south of Suwon and the current station building was opened to service the new line. In 2010, a taxi stand was constructed to facilitate drop-off and pick-up of passengers right outside the concourse entrance. The station is close to Osan Air Base and the western-style shopping district commonly called \\"Main Gate\\".

A band brake is a primary or secondary brake, consisting of a band of friction material that tightens concentrically around a cylindrical piece of equipment or EMUs to either prevent it from rotating (a static or \\"holding\\" brake), or to slow it (a dynamic brake). This application is common on winch drums and chain saws and is also used for some bicycle brakes. A former application was the locking of gear rings in epicyclic gearing. In modern automatic transmissions this task has been taken over entirely by multiple-plate clutches or multiple-plate brakes.  Features  Band brakes can be simple, compact, rugged, and can generate high force with a light input force. However, band brakes are prone to grabbing or chatter and loss of brake force when hot. These problems are inherent with the design and thus limit where band brakes are a good solution.  Effectiveness  One way to describe the effectiveness of the brake is as e^{\\\\mu \\\\theta}, where \\\\mu is the coefficient of friction between band and drum, and \\\\theta is the angle of wrap. With a large \\\\mu \\\\theta, the brake is very effective and requires low input force to achieve high brake force, but is also very sensitive to changes in \\\\mu. For example, light rust on the drum may cause the brake to \\"grab\\" or chatter, water may cause the brake to slip, and rising temperatures in braking may cause the coefficient of friction to drop slightly but in turn cause brake force to drop greatly. Using a band material with low \\\\mu increases the input force required to achieve a given brake force, but some low-\\\\mu materials also have more consistent \\\\mu across the range of working temperatures.

The fossils have been dated to the Triassic Period, from the Anisian to Ladinian stages. Considered a possible turtle ancestor due to its wide flattened torso covered in dermal ossicles, but now is considered to only be distantly related. Derived from a sister to Paraplacodus, Cyamodus phylogenetically preceded Placochelys. Meyer (1863) created the genus name Cyamodus for the \\"Schnabelplacodus\\" Cyamodus rostratus holotype skull material from Bindlach, which is today preserved and displayed in the Urwelt-Museum Oberfranken, Bayreuth. Discovery C. rostratus skull from below and above Cyamodus is the type genus of the monotypic family Cyamodontidae. Thus far, six species of Cyamodus have been identified - C. rostratus, C. munsteri, C. tarnowitzensis, C. hildegardis, C. kuhnschneyderi, and C. orientalis. Initially considered to be an ancestral turtle due to its testudine-like head and large, bifurcated carapace. However further investigation resulted in its reclassification as a placodont, and it is closely related to other turtle-like reptiles of the Triassic period such as Henodus and Psephoderma. Similar to these other placodonts, Cyamodus made its living by hovering close to the sea floor, vacuuming up various shellfish, and grinding them between its blunt teeth. Historically, the first Cyamodus remains were found in Upper Muschelkalk shallow marine limestones at near Bayreuth in Bavaria (Germany). They included the incomplete holotype skulls of Cyamodus muensteri and Cyamodus rostatus, which along with all other placodont remains recovered from the six quarries on the Lainecker Range in northern Bavaria were originally considered to have been derived from fish. The earliest Cyamodus skull was later restored by Muenster, with the addition of four teeth that had not been present in the original skull, and was named placodus muensteri. Further placodont remains were found by Muenster, who collected many placodont cranial remains in the Bindlach and Lainecker Range quarries. All placodont remains from those sites were then revised as being of reptilian origin by Owen (1858). The only known complete Cyamodus skeleton, including its skull, is that of C. hildegardis, which was found outside the Germanic Basin in the northern Tethys in Switzerland. Middle Triassic sauropterygian placodonts have become increasingly important for developing new ideas to the evolutionary history of their relatives, the turtles, whereas modern analyses place placodonts not as their ancestors using morphological cladistic analyses based on the bone osteology. The study of these placodonts contributes to our understanding of the Germanic Basin and the reptile distributions. An intriguing placodont that appears to be intermediate between Cyamodus and the placochelyids, Protenodontosaurus italicus, was described by Giovanni Pinna in 1990. Description Restoration of C. rostratus Cyamodus was a heavily armored swimmer, long, that fed mainly on shellfish that it was specialized to uproot and crush with its powerful jaws. The body of Cyamodus, specifically the armor, has been described as possessing a turtle-like flatness. The shell was a two-part carapace on the upper surface of the body. The larger half covered Cyamodus from the neck to the hips and spread out flat, almost encompassing the limbs. The second, smaller plate covered the hips and the base of the tail. The shells themselves are covered in hexagonal or circular plates of armor. The skull is heart-shaped and broad. Distinct from Paraplacodus, the skull of Cyamodus had a shorter rostrum, a smaller orbit and a larger upper temporal fenestra that was rimmed by ossifications. The teeth were flat discs, only one tooth appeared on each premaxilla and only two teeth appeared on each maxilla, with the largest teeth on the pterygoid. The quadratojugal joined the squamosal and sealed up the lateral temporal fenestra from the ancestral species (Paraplacodus). The carapace of C. hildegardis has a series of similar-sized, enlarged lateral armor plates is rounder and less laterally expanded than was hypothesized. The separate pelvic shield, also carrying a smaller set of lateral armor plates that decrease in size with an anterior/posterior gradient covering mainly the pelvic girdle and the base of the tail. The short tail is armored by four series of armor plates that also show an anterior/posterior gradient of size reduction equivalent to the size reduction of the caudal vertebrae. Until further fossils are recovered, the internal organisation of dermal plates within the two armor shields of C. hildegardis remains little known. Paleobiology Underside of a C. hildegardis skull Placodonts were specialist eaters of shellfish and had no need to grow big and very soon were out-sized by other marine reptiles like nothosaurs. Thus, placodonts like Cyamodus developed turtle-like shells to make themselves tough for other marine reptiles to eat. Although the shells would most likely have been too cumbersome for highly adept swimming, Cyamodus would still have been more agile than other single shelled placodonts like Henodus. The shells were also covered in hexagonal plates that not only increased the level of protection but also increased their weight, a typical placodont adaptation as additional weight just beyond the level of neutral buoyancy allowed them to dive to reach shellfish. Other adaptations for protection besides the heavily armored shell include the strongly built rear of the skull and limbs that do not protrude too far. Although the reduction in limb length restricted its ability to swim, its heavy shell greatly assisted its ability to dive. Cyamodus is also expected to have had difficulty maneuvering on land and probably only ventured out of the water for egg laying and periods of rest. Discovery of two fossil Cyamodus juveniles inside the stomach area of a Lariosaurus fossil has led to speculation about its vulnerability to predation. It has also been noted that juvenile specimens of Cyamodus have an extra tooth on the roof of their mouth, compared to adult specimens. This suggests that Cyamodus reduced the number of teeth as they grew to maturity. However, this could be due to a difference between species of Cyamodus. Underside of a C. kuhnschnyderi skull Additional isolated tooth finds of C. tarnowitzensis in the Lower Muschelkalk provide evidence for the broad dispersion of an early Cyamodus species via the Carpathian Gate and later the Silesian Gate, into the central Germanic Basin where carbonate sand bar facies were widely distributed and macroalgae meadows existed. During the Middle Muschelkalk, regression and the resulting basin evaporation and facies changes caused all placodonts to disappear from the central Germanic Basin and no records are known. In the Upper Muschelkalk, C. rostatus then appeared as the next cyamodont in the Germanic Basin and by the time of the maximum marine expansion into the Germanic Basin and across the northern Tethys, this species had acquired a widespread distribution. During the Longobardian (upper Lower Keuper) full marine regression, these cyamodonts must have retreated into the macroalgae-rich environments of the northern Tethys, where they may have evolved into other species or genera of placodonts. C. hildegardis from the Besano Formation (Middle Triassic) of the Alpine area of Switzerland and northern Italy has been reconstructed with a broad, laterally expanded main armor (carapace) and a separate smaller pelvic shield, giving it a sprawling appearance. A reexamination of the postcranial dermal armor and endoskeletal elements of the three best preserved articulated specimens of the species has led to new interpretations of the dermal armor and underlying postcranial bones, as well as a new life reconstruction. Geological and Environmental Information The oldest record of Cyamodus is a skull of C. tarnowitzensis from Pelsonian shallow marine deposits. During the middle Illyrian, placodonts disappeared from the Germanic Basin. With renewed upper Illyrian transgression, C. rostratus was found in terebratulid shell-rich shallow marine deposits. Abundant remains of Cyamodus muensteri have been reported from the upper Illyrian/middle Fassanian. Skeletal remains of this species are from the Grenzbitumenzone of the Monte San Giorgio lagoons. The most recent species, C. kuhnschnyderi, has been found in the upper Fassanian/lower Longobardian of the southern Germanic Basin or Burgundian Gate when marine facies in the Germanic Basin had nearly disappeared. These successive species provide evidence of monophylogenetic development with a trend towards anterior upper and lower jaw teeth reduction, along with a shortening of the rostrum (over interval of five million years, 243-238 Ma), suggesting an evolutionary adaptation to specialized feeding. The sediments of the Germanic Basin which contain Cyamodus and other placodont remains are generally similar in both the Lower and Upper Muschelkalk, comprising terebratulid and shell-rich shallow subtidal partly oolithic carbonates. Cyamodus remains were absent from the Germanic Basin during the Middle Muschelkalk, when tectonically controlled uplift resulted in shallowing of the basin, evaporation and a basin-wide disappearance of the macroalgae meadows. Evolution Placodus and Cyamodus The observed pattern of tooth reductions provides evidence supporting a newer interpretation that placodonts grazed on macroalgae, indicating that Cyamodus changed from an omnivore to an algae-grazer. The late/Upper Muschelkalk cyamodont C. kuhnschnyderi represents the most highly evolved Cyamodus species in the Germanic Basin, with the shortest rostrum, the greatest tooth reduction (having just one premaxillary, two maxillary and two palatine teeth) and the greatest tooth enlargement in both the upper and the lower jaws. The lower jaws still have three teeth, but now they also consist of the broadest anterior teeth of all the cyamodonts. Overall, this species has a dentition type similar to that of Placodus, with a food-squeezing function for both the lower and the upper jaws. Cyamodus did not have any dorsal spines, although it did have a wing-like elongated flattened lateral spine that served to brace the overlying subdermal carapace. Presumably, the dorsal spines disappeared to provide a closer and better braced association between the vertebrae and the carapace.

Nebbiem. The mansion has been rebuilt many times, most recently by the Hungarian Andr√°ssy family in the year 1880.

In the year 1985 it was declared a national cultural monument. Of particular interest among sacral sights is a classicist evangelical church from the year 1794. Originally it was built without a tower, which was later added in the year 1834. The Roman-Catholic church of Saint Elisabeth has an even older history.

(in Swedish) who contributed 13 articles over the journal's first four years. It was published by Johann Friedrich Gleditsch, with sponsorship from the Duke of Saxony, and was patterned after the French Journal des savants and the Italian Giornale de'letterati. The journal was published monthly, entirely in Latin, and contained excerpts from new writings, reviews, small essays and notes. Most of the articles were devoted to the natural sciences and mathematics, including contributions (apart from Leibniz) from, e.g., Jakob Bernoulli, Humphry Ditton, Leonhard Euler, Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus, Pierre-Simon Laplace and J√©r√¥me Lalande, but also from humanists and philosophers such as Veit Ludwig von Seckendorff, Stephan Bergler, Christian Thomasius and Christian Wolff. After Otto Mencke's death in 1707, Acta Eruditorum was directed by his son, Johann Burckhardt Mencke, who died in 1732. The journal changed its name by then and was called Nova Acta Eruditorum. Since 1756 it was led by Karl Andreas Bel. Role in the Calculus War Although Mencke once exchanged letters and publications with Isaac Newton, Newton was not a correspondent of Acta. The dispute between Newton and Leibniz over credit for the development of differential calculus started with a contribution by Leibniz to the May 1697 issue of Acta Eruditorum, in response to which Fatio de Duillier, feeling slighted by being omitted from Leibniz's list of the best mathematicians of Europe, announced that Newton had discovered calculus before Leibniz and the last had probably even relied on Newton's achievements. In the following acrimonious squabble, Acta by and large acted as a mouthpiece for Leibniz's camp, much as Transactions of the Royal Society did for Newton's. Mencke tried to tone down the dispute, but rebuttals from both sides were too forceful. \\"Where Mencke was powerless to call the tune, he did his utmost at least to set the tone,\\" says H. Laeven in his description of the row. This dispute also influenced Acta to express the feelings of national cohesion and defining German scholarship within the international field of influence.

Swan made 299 appearances for Sheffield Wednesday plus two as substitute, he was a regular in the England national side for two years between May 1960 and May 1962 winning 19 full caps, he also represented England at Under 19 and Under 23 level. Despite his ability as a top-class defender he will be mostly remembered for his involvement in a betting scandal that led to him being banned from football for eight years between 1964 and 1972.  Early life  Peter Swan was born in South Elmsall near Pontefract in West Yorkshire on 8 October 1936, he was one of seven children, all boys. At a young age he moved to Armthorpe near Doncaster where he attended Armthorpe Secondary Modern School, playing in the school football team along with Alan Finney. Swan was initially a right winger before being converted to centre half during his time at school. Swan played for Doncaster Schools as a teenager and joined Sheffield Wednesday as a 15-year-old amateur in 1952, working part-time at Armthorpe Colliery at the same time. In November 1953 he signed as a part-time professional for Wednesday, progressing to full professional just after his 18th birthday.  Sheffield Wednesday  As an 18-year-old Swan was called up for National Service, serving in the Royal Signals as a PTI at Catterick Garrison. However this did not hinder his progress at Hillsborough as he was allowed leave to play in games. He made his first team debut at 19 against Barnsley on 5 November 1955. For three years Swan was not a regular member of the side, usually playing when Don McEvoy was injured. However at the start of the 1958‚Äì59 season he became first choice centre half for the club and was a prominent member of the team in their excellent seasons in the late 1950s and early 1960s. During that time Wednesday finished 5th in the 1959‚Äì60 season in Division One and then runners up to the double winning Tottenham Hotspur side in 1960‚Äì61 and then sixth in the next three seasons.\\"Setting The Record Straight\\", Peter Swan with Nick Johnson Gives football career and biographical information. Swan made his full England debut during this golden period as a 23-year-old against Yugoslavia on 11 May 1960. He played the next 19 international matches consecutively for England over the next two years up to his last appearance on 9 May 1962 against Switzerland. These 19 appearances included nine friendly internationals, six Home Internationals and four qualifying matches for the 1962 World Cup finals in Chile. Swan was selected for the squad for the 1962 World Cup finals in Chile; he fell ill with Tonsillitis before leaving but recovered and travelled with the squad. However, he contracted dysentery while in Chile and never played a game with Maurice Norman and Bobby Moore playing as centre backs.  Betting scandal  The betting scandal, which also involved two other Wednesday players, Tony Kay and David Layne, involved the three betting on Sheffield Wednesday to lose their away match at Ipswich Town F.C. on Saturday 1 December 1962. Ipswich won the match 2‚Äì0 with two goals from Ray Crawford. In an interview with The Times newspaper in July 2006, Swan said \\"We lost the game fair and square, but I still don't know what I'd have done if we'd been winning. It would have been easy for me to give away a penalty or even score an own goal. Who knows?\\". The betting ring was uncovered and publicised by a major article in The People newspaper. Swan was banned on Monday 13 April 1964 just as he was preparing to play against Tottenham that evening, his place in the team being taken by Vic Mobley. Swan received a four-month jail sentence in Lincoln jail and a life ban from football. It is believed that he might otherwise have been part of the England squad that won the 1966 World Cup; he was once told by England manager Alf Ramsey that he was \\"top of the list\\".  Return to playing  During his time out of football Swan worked as a car salesman for a time before, in 1968, becoming a landlord at pubs in both Sheffield and Chesterfield. The life ban from football was lifted in 1972 and Swan returned to play for the Sheffield Wednesday first team for the start of the 1972‚Äì73 season in a match against Fulham which Wednesday won 3‚Äì0. He made 15 appearances plus two as substitute that season as Wednesday led the Second Division for the opening months, however the team's form faded and Swan lost his place in the side, his final appearance for Wednesday being on 11 November 1972. Wednesday manager Derek Dooley offered Swan a contract for 1973‚Äì74 but this involved playing reserve team football and helping the young players. Swan rejected this offer and signed for Bury after a move to Chesterfield broke down. Ironically Swan scored on his debut for Bury against Torquay United after just three minutes after playing over 300 matches for Sheffield Wednesday and never finding the net. He captained Bury for the 1973‚Äì74 season and led them to promotion to Division Three. He left Bury after only being offered a month-to-month contract for 1974‚Äì75, and at the age of 37 he ended his professional playing career.  Management  Swan turned his hand to management in the summer of 1974 when he took charge of non-league Matlock Town. His first season at the helm was a great success, with Matlock getting past the qualifying rounds of the FA Cup for only the second time in the club's history. Better still, Matlock reached the final of the 1975 FA Trophy and faced Scarborough at Wembley Stadium. Despite being the underdogs Matlock went on to win the match by a convincing 4‚Äì0 margin. Swan resigned at the end of his second season in charge hoping to find a full-time management position elsewhere. He eventually returned as manager in November 1980, with his second spell at the club lasting just over a year after a poor run of results. Swan also had spells as manager at Worksop Town and Buxton. His son Carl who played league football for Doncaster Rovers and Rochdale in the late 1970s also played when his father was in charge at Matlock and Worksop.  Present day  After continuing to run a public house in Chesterfield for a time, Peter Swan is now retired. He released a biographical book in September 2006 called \\"Setting The Record Straight\\" written in conjunction with Nick Johnson (). Tragically, Peter Swan's son Gary died of stomach cancer aged only 39 in 1998. Since the mid-2000s, Swan has had Alzheimer's disease.

The beer was locally popular in Detroit from the company's inception, but grew in popularity and was eventually available in many states for a brief period in the 1940s, with an ad campaign in Life magazine that featured restaurant ads from many famous eateries around the country using Goebel beer as an ingredient. The beer, billed as a \\"light lager\\", was golden in color, and was noticeably drier than most everyday beers of the era. Their longtime mascot was a bantam, called Brewster Rooster, who wore attire with Goebel's logo, and the beer was a long-time sponsor of Detroit Tigers baseball broadcasts on radio. Prohibition forced the closure of the brewery in 1920 though the space was rented out to various industries. In 1932 the company was reorganized. Though Prohibition was repealed in 1933 the brewery would not begin new production until the Spring of 1934. Otto Rosenbusch, the retired brewmaster from Stroh Brewery Company, was brought on to help Goebel compete against his old employer at Stroh's and his son Herman who was the head brewer there. Upon the elder Rosenbusch's passing in 1935, Charles Elich, the brewmaster at the Pabst Brewing Company agreed to become both the brewmaster and superintendent at Goebel. In the John Bellairs book The Trolley to Yesterday and its eventual sequel The Wrath of the Grinning Ghost, the character of Brewster (really Horus, a god of Upper and Lower Egypt) is given his name because he bears a resemblance to Brewster Rooster.The Trolley to Yesterday, pgs. 14 and 15. A new production technique In the mid 1960s, Goebel began advertising that their beer was \\"real\\" (unpasteurized) draft beer. Normally, bottled and canned beer had to be pasteurized to kill the active yeast left in the beer after brewing was completed, otherwise the buildup of gasses in the bottle would explode them on store shelves or ruin the taste of the beer even if the bottles stayed intact. This does not affect draft beer, which is kept at refrigerator temperatures from brewery to tap. Goebel's method of achieving this was a bacterium cultivated by the company's chemists that acted specifically on the yeast in the beer, then died harmlessly when the yeast was all consumed. Sales spiked, as people liked the \\"draft-like\\" flavor of the beer, but the technique was short-lived, as the bacteria became prevalent everywhere in the brewery, affecting other aspects of the brewing process negatively, and it had to be discontinued. The beer never regained its previous popularity after that point, exacerbated by the gradual changing of tastes in a new generation of beer drinkers who preferred a lighter, sweeter beer. Comedian George Gobel became a spokesman for Goebel Beer for obvious reasons.http://www.angelfire.com/ny/nyuk/images/gobelbeerad.jpg Later years Goebel was popular in its latter days in the 1970s and 1980s, as a low-priced beer, sold by the case in bottles and aluminum cans. In the mid to late seventies, a case of twenty four bottles cost $4.44 not including the dollar refund when all empties were returned. Eventually, Pabst Brewing Company acquired Stroh's and their other brands (including Goebel), and discontinued the Goebel brand at the end of 2005.

It's a tale about Ruliya, a female orca-riding knight, making an epic journey through the aqueous world of Marmundo. After publishing three volumes, Kishiro placed the series on hiatus to draw Battle Angel Alita: Last Order. He has promised to continue Aqua Knight when that is finished.Notice on Yukitopia.com Story In the first volume, Lady Ruliya, a young knight in training, becomes lost during a storm and sinks in her submersible armor. A young boy, Ashika, saves her with the help of his father, Arrabarus. She finds herself on the lighthouse island they guard, far away from civilization. As thanks for his help, Ruliya promises Ashika anything, but she immediately regrets it as Ashika wants to become a knight as her. She is a woman of her word and shows her skill as a knight in fighting Arrabarus, who turns out to be an old aqua knight. However, the duel is interrupted by the travelling genius Alcantara in his flying fortress. He steals the lighthouse's light sphere, which Ashika calls Niselle and claims is his mother. In the ensuing battle, the lighthouse is destroyed and by some mysterious connection this kills Arrabarus. Ashika is also kidnapped. Tagmec, knight of the Underworld, emerges from the sea to claim the old man, but not before Ruliya promises to rescue the boy and the light. Tagmec informs her she is embarking on a quest of destiny. He grants her Muertogara, a magical blade, for this purpose. In volume two, more is seen of the eccentric Alcantara, his wondrous inventions and his crew, and see how Ashika endures his captivity. Meanwhile, Ruliya pursues them on her orca mount, but comes across a mysterious knight who invites her to his castle in the middle of the sea. He turns out to be a demon knight who is after both Ruliya and her magic sword. Despite his tricks and charms, Ruliya defeats him. Pinoque, a fairy friend from her childhood, returns to her to aid in her quest, and she sets out after Ashika and the light sphere with renewed purpose. Volume three tells the story of Alcantara, his history in the far- away land of Zygote and his quest in Marmundo. Through a flashback, we learn how he became the greatest genius in Zygote, but was forced to flee because of his unorthodox ideas and dangerous experiments. He escaped Zygote in a zeppelin, taking with him Zykey, a young woman whose mysterious Nil-nil disease prompted him to become the genius he is today. His quest is to cure her of the disease, which makes her disappear gradually. Lady Ruliya catches up with Alcantara before this, and they duel underwater for the sphere. Ruliya manages to beat Alcantara's masterful swordsmanship in the end, but they emerge from the sea to find that sinister, demonic powers have been plotting to take the sphere for themselves. A great battle against the metal demon ensues, and only with the help of the forces of the Underworld Knight Tagmec can Ruliya finally defeat it with her magic blade. Ashika also denies the demon the sphere by absorbing its light into himself. Alcantara finds himself seemingly defeated and his inventions in ruins, but finds out that he has found the cure for Zykey's disease by providing her with adventure and a happy life. Zykey reveals her love for Alcantara, and a marriage is arranged. But Alcantara is rescued by his henchmen and flies off in a new zeppelin, followed by a determined Zykey. Characters Ruliya of Perla is a young knight in training, on the quest required to become a true knight. Like all knights of Marmundo, she rides an orca and wears a massive, magical armor that increases her strength and allows her to fight under water. Ashika, a young boy who has grown up on a small island with his father Arrabarus, is an impulsive, emotional child who is as naive and uneducated as he is optimistic. But as he becomes Ruliya's squire and is kidnapped by Alcantara, he is forced to grow up and learn about the world. Arrabarus, a giant, scarred old man, claims the title of king of the lighthouse island, but has a history as a great aqua knight. Niselle seems to be a glowing sphere that is the light source of Arrabarus' lighthouse. However, he claims it is his wife and Ashika thinks of Niselle as his mother. She holds some mystic power that Alcantara as well as evil spirits want. Alcantara, a wandering genius, nobleman, and inventor, has fled his homelands in search of the elixir of life, of which he believes Niselle is an ingredient. Although he seems to be singularly dedicated to his discoveries and inventions, he has softer sides hidden under layers of eccentricity. Zykey is Alcantara's minion, accompanying him on his journeys. She is a kind young woman who suffers from the strange Nil-Nil disease, which Alcantara has promised to cure. Zycrow, another of Alcantara's minions, was once an assassin. Now he serves his master and often becomes the unlucky target of his eccentric tempers. Pinoque is a small fairy girl with butterfly wings. Ruliya saved her when she was a child, and Pinoque has watched over her ever since. Setting The world of Marmundo is a big ocean with few islands. The kingdom of Enorme, lady Ruliya's home, claims some of these islands. Marmundo is separated in two halves ‚Äî one with the lands where Ruliya comes from, and the Antipodes, where Zygote, home of Alcantara, lies. A great waterfall divides the halves. Marmundo itself is a flat world, with another great waterfall running over the end and into darkness. The world of Marmundo has a pantheon of gods, where Magna Primero is the greatest. There are also several spheres of spirit powers. Parca, the realm of the dead, is one.

He was also known for bringing the United States inventions of chewing gum and cotton candy (known in Australia as fairy floss) to Australia. Early life Macpherson Robertson was born in Ballarat, Victoria. He was the eldest of seven children of Macpherson David Robertson, a Scottish carpenter born in Uruguay, and his Irish wife, Margaret (n√©e Browne). The family came to Ballarat in search of gold but fell on hard times, with the father abandoning them and moving to Fiji. In 1869, his mother returned to Leith, in Scotland, together with Macpherson, his three siblings and another child on the way. In Scotland, at the age of nine, Macpherson started working to support the family, eventually taking an apprenticeship with the Victoria Confectionery Co. In 1874, the family returned to Australia at the request of his father, then living in the Melbourne working class suburb of Fitzroy. Using skills he acquired in Scotland, in 1878, at the age of 19, Macpherson set up a confectionery manufacturing operation in the bathroom of the family home. He made confectionery on Mondays to Thursdays and sold them around Melbourne on Fridays and Saturdays. Business His business quickly grew as Mac Robertson Steam Confectionery Works. By the late 1880s the business employed thirty people. The company created numerous confections including Freddo Frog, Cherry Ripe, Old Gold Chocolates, Milk Kisses and Columbines. By 1900, it had become the largest confectionery works in Australia with agencies in every state. As part of his marketing strategy, Macpherson maintained a distinctive whiteness to everything he could ‚Äì the buildings in the Fitzroy factory complex were all painted white and all of his several thousand employees wore white uniforms. Macpherson himself ensured he was always seen in public dressed immaculately in white and rode in a carriage behind two white ponies. The factory complex became known as White City. In 1967 MacRobertson's was acquired by English confectioner Cadbury's which in 1969 merged with Schweppes Australia to become Cadbury Schweppes. On 2 February 2010, Cadbury was purchased by Kraft Foods. Kraft Foods announced they would be splitting into two companies beginning on 1 October 2012. The confectionery business became Mondelez International, of which Cadbury is a subsidiary.

He has been called a \\"writer's writer\\", which is used as both a compliment and criticism.JSTOR Biography Shimao was born in Yokohama, but his family moved to Kobe when he was eight. His mother died when he was seventeen and soon after he had a period of study in Nagasaki. He later traveled to Taiwan and the Philippines, but returned to education and graduated from Kyushu University in 1943. In 1944 he entered the military and was sent to Japan's southern Amami Islands as an officer for a naval suicide attack (kamikaze) squadron in World War II. The war ended while he was still waiting for his orders. His wartime experiences inspired his earliest works, including Shima no hate (1946) and Shutsukot≈ç-ki (A Tale of Leaving a Lonely Island, 1949), as well as several later works including Shuppatsu wa tsui ni otozurezu (1962) and Gyoraitei gakusei (Student on the Torpedo Boat, 1985). His wartime period is also where he met his wife, Miho, a Catholic.\\"The God That Failed: The Literary Trajectory of Shimao Toshio\\" by Hiroko Tokumoto (PDF) A second major theme in his work is that of madness in women, with notable examples in Ware fukaki fuchi yori (1954) and Shi no toge (The Sting of Death, 1960). This theme was related to his wife's mental illness. At some point in 1955, the date is unclear, his wife became mentally ill to the point of requiring hospitalization. He then chose to live with her at the mental hospital, which was seen as a highly unusual action yet praised by Yutaka Haniya's wife as showing \\"extraordinarily deep love.\\" Although Shimao seems to have felt somewhat to blame for his wife's illness due to his past affairs and what he describes as his own selfishness. In 1955 he took her back to Amami ≈åshima, the largest of the Amami Islands; his novella The Sting of Death describes this period using his own name and that of his wife. That work was adapted for the film The Sting of Death in 1990. A possible third aspect is that in 1956 he converted to Catholicism and his interest is said to be present with the title \\"The Sting of Death\\" being a reference to 1 Corinthians 15:55.

As of 2006, these semi-permanent portable buildings have been removed and replaced with permanent facilities. In March 2011, the track and football field were renovated. The dirt track has been replaced by a synthetic track and the field has been replaced with new natural grass. Years later, however, the field had been replaced by imitation grass and turf.

The home had been in existence since 1700, had withstood the rigours of the Revolution, and had never been without a band of devoted women, bound only by the ties of charity, and tacitly rendering obedience to the oldest of their number. *The Sisters of the Holy Heart of Mary were founded in 1842 at Nancy, by Alexis-Basile-Alexandre Menjaud, later Bishop of Nancy and Toul, for the purpose of instructing young girls in various trades, and protecting their virtue. The statutes, drawn up by the Abb√© Masson, provide that the congregation shall own nothing but the houses which they occupy; that everything over and above shall go to the maintenance of poor children and the decoration of altars. The devotion of Perpetual Adoration was instituted in the mother-house. *The Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary (IHM), founded as the Daughters of the Most Holy and Immaculate Heart of the Blessed Virgin Mary, is a Catholic religious teaching institute for women, founded in Spain in 1848 by Father Joaquim Masmitj√† i de Puig as a means of rebuilding society through the education of young women. A daughter house of the community was founded in Los Angeles, California, USA, in 1871, and in 1924 formally separated from the Spanish congregation and was established as a distinct institute in its own right. *The Sister-Servants of the Holy Heart of Mary were founded at Paris, in 1860, by P√®re Delaplace, and Marie-Jeanne Moisan, for the Christian education of children, and the visitation and care of the sick in hospitals and in their own homes. This congregation is particularly flourishing in Canada, where about 140 sisters have charge of about 2500 children. There are six communities in the United States. *The Daughters of the Holy Heart of Mary were founded by Mgr. Kob√®s, at Dakar, Senegal on 24 May 1858, for native women. In touch as they are with the customs and dialects of their country, they render invaluable services in teaching, visiting various mission stations, caring for the sick, and preparing catechumens for baptism. Their immunity from yellow fever enabled them to care for the Europeans stricken during epidemics. In the Vicariate of Senegambia were six communities with about forty sisters. *The Congregation of the Holy and Immaculate Heart of Mary was founded, at the desire of the Synod of Pondicherry, by P√®re Dupuis for the Christian education of young Indian girls. The native prejudice against the education of their women was gradually overcome and the congregation took charge of orphanages, pharmacies and schools. Most of the sisters have government certificates of proficiency in the various grades. *The Sisters of the Holy and Immaculate Heart of Mary were founded in July, 1848, at Pico Heights, Los Angeles, California, U.S.A. In the Diocese of Monterey and Los Angeles the sisters number about 110, and have charge of about 700 children and 60 orphans, in 1 college, 5 academies, and 1 orphan asylum. *The Sister-Servants of the Immaculate Heart of Mary were founded at Quebec in 1859 by Mgr Turgeon, Archbishop of Quebec, and Mme Marie Roy, in religion Sister Marie du Sacr√©-Coeur (d. 1885), to shelter penitent girls, and provide Christian education for children. The congregation now numbers about 400 members in the United States and Canada in charge of 26 establishments, 152 penitents, and about 5500 children. *The Sisters, Servants of the Immaculate Heart of Mary were founded at Monroe, Michigan, U.S.A. on 28 November 1845 by the Rev. Louis Gillet, C.SS.R., for the work of teaching. In 1856 an independent mother-house was established at Villa Maria, Westchester County, Pennsylvania, and later a third at Scranton, Pennsylvania. The congregation took charge of academies, normal schools, parochial schools and asylums in eleven dioceses, and number about 1200 sisters. *The Missionary Sons of the Immaculate Heart of Mary or Claretians were founded at Vic, Catalonia, in 1848, by Saint Anthony Mary Claret (d. 1870). They took charge of a mission on Fernando Po, and stations at Corisco and Annobon in Western Africa. *The Congregation of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, also called the Congregation of Scheutveld, was founded in 1862 by Theophiel Verbist (d. 1865), a former military chaplain, for mission work, especially in China. The congregation in the early 20th century numbered over 300 members in charge of the Vicariates Apostolic of Central, Eastern and South-Western Mongolia, and in China the Vicariate of Northern Kan-su and the Prefecture Apostolic of Southern Kan-su, where in all about 155 Fathers have charge of about 51,600 Catholics, 20,000 catechumens, 250 churches and chapels, and 263 schools, with an attendance of 6000; in Africa, in the Vicariate Apostolic of Belgian Congo and the Prefecture Apostolic of Upper Kassai, 52 priests and 20 lay brothers are over about 15,000 Catholics, 29,300 catechumens, 38 churches and chapels and 28 schools, attended by 2300 children. *The were founded at Vienna, in 1843, by Barbara Maix (d. 1873), and in 1848 established in Brazil, where, in addition to the mother-house at Porto Alegre, they have institutions elsewhere, chiefly orphan asylums. *The Sisters of the Sacred Heart of Mary were founded in 1848 by Jean Gailhac at B√©ziers in the Diocese of Montpellier, for the work of teaching and the care of orphans.

Plot During a subcommittee hearing, Carcetti expresses concern that the impressive reduction in crime from the Western may be a misrepresentation. He further lays into Burrell about the ongoing problems in the city's witness protection program, ignoring advice from both Gray and D'Agostino. At a dinner with Carcetti and his wife, D'Agostino chastises Carcetti for his short-sightedness in using facts to win arguments instead of an inspiring message, and arranges for Carcetti to get coaching to improve his demeanor. In Hamsterdam, one of the drug dealers is assaulted, bound, gagged, and robbed in one of the vacant buildings. Once the stick-up crew has left, the dealers manage to escape and alert the police. The dealers plead with Carver, Herc and Colicchio that if they are not allowed to carry weapons, then the police should guard them against stick-ups. Elsewhere, Colvin takes his friend the Deacon on a tour of the improved neighborhood, then brings him into Hamsterdam. Colvin suggests to Carver that he pay the young lookouts to act as auxiliary police and watch for trouble. The Deacon, disgusted by Hamsterdam, cannot be convinced that Colvin's scheme is a good idea. He asks Colvin to provide clean water, needles, condoms and treatment centers now that the addicts have been concentrated into one place. Over drinks, Carver, Herc, Colicchio, and Truck debate the merits of Hamsterdam. Cutty helps the Deacon load boxes into a car, saying he needs to occupy himself to stay straight. A community leader named Roman meets with both men, suggesting they hold a basketball tournament to keep Hamsterdam's restless boys occupied. When Cutty tells the Deacon he is more experienced a boxer, Roman suggests an abandoned gym that the kids can use. When Roman presents Cutty with a disused gym, Cutty resolves to fix it up himself, pleased to have something to work on. Colvin leaves a meeting with the Deacon to attend a ComStat briefing, where Rawls insinuates Colvin is altering his figures to get his significantly lowered crime figures and asks Colvin to give him his records for review. After Colvin, Roman, and the Deacon meet with a representative of a public health non-profit, the major institutes initiatives to exchange needles and provide free condoms in Hamsterdam. Using its serial number, Prez traces Bodie's disposable phone to the store where it was sold. Freamon maps out store locations and finds that they are spread along I-95 between Baltimore and Richmond. He assigns McNulty and Greggs to track the buyer of the phones. Upon visiting the store, the detectives find that security tapes are reused after a week, so there is no chance of getting footage of the buyer. Greggs decides they should drive further out to independent stores. In Dumfries, Virginia, McNulty and Greggs find a mini-mart where Bernard bought eight phones, only to be told they also reuse their security tapes. Realizing the local police could help them, McNulty approaches the local sheriff and feigns racism under the assumption that the sheriff will be more inclined to help him. However, McNulty learns that the sheriff's deputy, who is also his wife, is black. The sheriff cooperates anyway and promises to provide outdoor security footage of the mini-mart. McNulty and Greggs find a motel and discuss infidelity. Upon returning to the detail, the detectives find Agent Terrence \\"Fitz\\" Fitzhugh installing new equipment, which allows Prez to enlarge the mini-mart footage and get Bernard's plate number. Greggs and Prez track the plate number to a rental agency and find that Bernard rents a car from them every couple of weeks to make his collections. McNulty meets with Brianna and insists that D'Angelo could not have killed himself, and that he was most likely the victim of a planned murder. McNulty guilt trips Brianna concerning her role in the Barksdales and D'Angelo's turn to crime, leaving her crying uncontrollably. At Rico's funeral, Avon and Slim Charles plot revenge on Marlo. Meanwhile, Bell meets with Senator Davis to question him about the lack of progress in his development business. Back in the office, Avon gives Charles a contact in social services to find some of Omar's relatives. Charles suggests that splitting their efforts between Omar and Marlo may be a mistake, but Avon reassures him that he can handle everything. Shamrock bribes a social services employee and learns the address for Omar's grandmother. Charles has Sapper and Gerard to stake out the house and tells them to wait for Omar to show up. Sapper once more fails to understand the plan. Krawczyk tells Bell about a rival property developer garnered much success associating with Davis. When Bell comes back to insist that Davis move faster in making him money, the senator takes him to meet a contact who can arrange federal funding. Bell gives Davis a briefcase full of cash; Davis calls this a sign that Stringer is still not ready, but takes the money and tells Stringer that everything is a go. Brianna visits the funeral home looking for Avon; Bell tries to dissuade her from talking to him and promises to put them in touch. Omar Omar has moved his crew over to the East side and is having much more success robbing the dealers there. On their return to the West side they are surprised at Hamsterdam. Omar believes it is too good to be true and refuses to consider it as a target. Stanfield Organization Marlo catches a girl watching him in a club and approaches her. Marlo checks that she is there with friends and declines both drinking and dancing. Instead they leave the club together. After they have sex in his car she persuades him to meet her again the following day. She tells him her name is Devonne. Marlo phones Devonne to arrange a meeting, but feels suspicious. He assigns Chris Partlow to deal with Devonne to avoid possible problems in the future. Snoop sits in the restaurant where Marlo had arranged to meet Devonne and recognizes Perry, a Barksdale soldier, buying a large quantity of food and taking it to a nearby SUV. Snoop reports in to Partlow. Partlow observes Devonne receiving a signal from the car. In response, he has his driver pull up alongside the SUV, at which point Partlow fires a shotgun through the side window, wounding Avon in the shoulder and killing Tater. Shamrock reports the shooting to Stringer and tells him that Brianna has been calling looking for Avon. Stringer orders Shamrock to keep Brianna away from him and Avon. Slim Charles takes Avon to a veterinarian to address his injuries. Avon meets with Shamrock, Slim Charles and Perry and tells them they are going to wait out Marlo, forcing him to return to the corners to make money. Stringer interrupts the meeting. He warns Avon about the consequences of war. Avon criticizes Stringer as being too concerned with money and having lost his hard edge for the street and warns he may not be smart enough for the business world. Stringer says that thinking before killing does not make him soft, but Avon challenges Stringer's manhood by asking him who he has killed. Stringer reports Brianna's meeting with McNulty and reveals to Avon that he was behind D'Angelo's death, and that his was a life that had to be taken. Avon attacks Stringer, but Stringer overpowers his wounded friend and tells him that he did it for him, to protect him from D'Angelo turning against him. Stringer lets Avon up from the ground, and Avon walks away and sits down, speechless as the screen fades to black.

The company's technology is similar to Abacast and Octoshape. Rawflow was incorporated in 2002 by Mikkel Dissing, Daniel Franklin and Stephen Dicks. Its main office was in London, UK. Velocix acquired RawFlow in July 2008. Alcatel-Lucent acquired Velocix in July 2009. The streaming media CDN solution by Alcatel-Lucent is called Velocix Digital Media Delivery Platform. A peer-to-peer (or P2P) computer network relies on the computing power and bandwidth of the participants in the network rather than concentrating it in a relatively low number of servers. When using this technology, the bandwidth requirement of the broadcast is intelligently distributed over the entire network of participants, instead of being centralised at the broadcast's origin; as the audience grows so do the network resources available to distribute that broadcast without adding any additional bandwidth costs.  How does it work?  The RawFlow ICD (Intelligent Content Distribution) Server provides the initial contact point for clients in the network. When initially installed, the ICD Server connects to the broadcaster‚Äôs existing media server and begins receiving the stream, maintaining a buffer of stream data in memory at all times. It then begins accepting connections from clients and serving them with the stream. When launched by a user, the ICD Client first contacts the ICD Server and begins receiving the stream from it. The media player plays the stream as it is received by the ICD Client. If it has available resources, the ICD Client also accepts connections from other clients in the grid to which it may relay a portion or the whole stream it receives as requested. The ICD Client monitors the quality of the stream it is receiving and upon any reduction of quality or loss of connection it again searches the grid for available resources while continuing to serve the media player from its buffer. The buffer prevents interruption to the playback and ensures that the end-user experience is not affected. The ICD Server is always available as a last resort for clients that cannot find sufficient available resources in the grid. This guarantees a constant seed of the stream.

The date of the festival as observed in the Sassanid era was on the 5th day of the month Spandarmad. When the name of the day and the month of the day were the same, a \\"name-feast\\" celebration was always done. According to the testimony of al-Biruni, in the 11th century CE there was a festival when the names of the day and the month were the same. The deity Spandarmad protected the Earth and the \\"good, chaste and beneficent wife who loves her husband\\". According to him, the festival used to be dedicated to women, and men would make them \\"liberal presents\\", and the custom was still flourishing in some districts of Fahla.Boyce, 1990, p. 69  Barzegaran Festival  The jashn-e barzegar√°n (Festival of Agriculturists), is celebrated in Iran also on the 5th day of Spandarmad month (the Spandarmad day). People pray for good harvest, honor the deity of Earth SpandƒÅrmad, and put signs on doors to destroy evil spirits. The observation of this festival has been revived in modern Iran, where it is mostly set on the 5th day of Esfand in the Solar Hejri calendar introduced in 1925, corresponding to 24 February.

Gas 5 was the first Gasolin' album to include songs with English lyrics (if you do not include the albums that Gasolin' released only for the international market). From this album \\"Rabalderstr√¶de\\" / \\"Kvinde min\\" and \\"Refrainet er frit\\" / \\"Good Time Charlie\\" were released as singles. Gas 5 was recorded at Rosenberg Studio in Copenhagen with Freddy Hansson as sound engineer. For the first time ever in Denmark an album was recorded with a 24-track mix board. That board was also used for the album cover. Gas 5 was released on CD in 1987 with Efter endnu en dag (1976), but due to lack of space \\"Good Time Charlie\\" was omitted.

This dish is prepared by first boiling the octopus inside a copper cauldron. Before actually boiling it, the octopus' tentacles are dipped in and out of the boiling water three times, held by its head. The objective of this operation is to curl the tips of the tentacles. The tentacles are preferred over the head, which sometimes is discarded. After the octopus has been boiled, it is trimmed with scissors, sprinkled with coarse salt and both sweet and spicy paprika (known in Galicia as pemento and pemento picante) and drizzled with olive oil. The optimal cooking point is the one in which octopus is not rubbery but not overcooked either, similarly to the al dente concept in Italian pasta cooking. This is achieved after approximately a 40‚Äì90 minutes boil, provided that the octopus is left to rest for a further 20 minutes inside the boiled water away from the fire. The dish is traditionally served on wooden plates and bread. Tradition dictates that water should not be drunk when eating octopus, so the dish is usually served accompanied by young Galician red wine. Traditionally, this diatopic use of octopus was facilitated by its inland availability as stockfish. In the last decades, frozen octopus has replaced dried octopus. Fresh octopus is not so frequently used nowadays either, as it is necessary to pound it heavily before cooking to avoid the dish becoming rubbery. This procedure can be skipped after freezing, which, unlike other seafood, does not alter the organoleptic properties of octopus. The provinces of Ourense and Lugo have a reputation for good octopus cooking. Fair style octopus is the totemic food of the patron saint festivities of Lugo (San Froil√°n). Some Galician cooks specialize in this dish. They are usually women, known by the name polbeiras (Galician name).https://academia.gal/dicionario/-/termo/polbeira After the modern decline of traditional rural fairs, many polbeiras (octopus restaurants, by its Galician name) have sprouted across the Galician geography.

Quartet is a sequence of four crime fiction novels by James Ellroy set in the late 1940s through the late 1950s in Los Angeles. They are: * (1987) The Black Dahlia * (1988) The Big Nowhere * (1990) L.A. Confidential * (1992) White Jazz Elmore Leonard wrote that \\"reading The Black Dahlia aloud would shatter wine glasses\\". Several characters from the L.A. Quartet, most notably Dudley Smith, were introduced in Ellroy's 1982 novel Clandestine, which is set between 1951 and 1955 and makes reference to the Black Dahlia killing and Dudley Smith's investigation into it. The four novels, along with The Underworld U.S.A. Trilogy novels, were recently reprinted in 2019 into omnibus editions part of the Everyman's Library series. Ellroy has also started writing The Second L.A. Quartet, which takes place before the events of The L.A. Quartet. It includes the real life and fictional characters from The L.A. Quartet and The Underworld U.S.A. Trilogy. Two novels of The Second L.A. Quartet have been released: Perfidia in 2014, and This Storm in 2019. The significance of this series and uniting the three series is noted in the dramatis personae of This Storm, stating: \\"This Storm is the second volume of the Second L.A. Quartet. The first volume, Perfidia, covers December 6 through December 29, 1941. The L.A. Quartet--The Black Dahlia, The Big Nowhere, L.A. Confidential, and White Jazz--covers the years 1946 to 1958 in Los Angeles. The Underworld U.S.A. Trilogy--American Tabloid, The Cold Six Thousand, and Blood's A Rover--covers 1958 to 1972, on a national scale. The Second L.A. Quartet places real-life and fictional characters from the first two bodies of work in Los Angeles, during World War II, as significantly younger people. These three series span thirty-one years and will stand as one novelistic history.\\" Summary The Black Dahlia, the first novel in the series, follows a brutal murder in the late 1940s. On January 15, 1947, Elizabeth Short's body was discovered in a vacant lot. Officers Dwight \\"Bucky\\" Bleichert and Leland \\"Lee\\" Blanchard, partners and local celebrities from their boxing days, aid the investigation. The next novel, The Big Nowhere, takes place in the early 1950s amidst the Red Scare in Hollywood. Former Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) detective Buzz Meeks, who now works as an enforcer for gangster Mickey Cohen and a pimp for Howard Hughes, gets caught up in a communist investigation that has ties to a series of homosexual murders that are being investigated by a sheriff's deputy named Danny Upshaw. The work of Meeks and Upshaw also crosses paths with the investigations of Mal Considine and Dudley Smith, who are working on a communist case of their own. The third novel, L.A. Confidential, spans about eight years‚Äîfrom early 1950 to about April 1958. The story begins on February 21, 1950, when Buzz Meeks is found at an abandoned auto court where he is hiding out. Meeks is killed by Dudley Smith, and the 18 pounds of heroin Meeks stole from a Jack Dragna-Mickey Cohen truce meeting is subsequently retrieved by Smith. A year later, Bloody Christmas occurs: the beating of unarmed suspects by LAPD officers on Christmas Day. Ed Exley, Bud White, and Jack Vincennes are the main officers caught in the scandal. On April 16, 1953, the Nite Owl Massacre becomes the focus of the LAPD. The massacre involved the killing of civilians in an all-night restaurant. Three African Americans are the suspects. While resisting arrest, they are gunned down by Exley, who is proclaimed a hero. Years pass, and new evidence emerges that the African-American youths were innocent of the Nite Owl killings. The case is reopened. Ultimately, between Exley, White, and Vincennes, a criminal conspiracy involving Exley, White, and Vincennes is uncovered. It involved Mickey Cohen, the drug rackets, pornography, the stolen heroin from years back, a chemist trying to alter the chemical compound of the heroin to improve it, framing the African-American youths, and at the center of all of it, Dudley Smith. In the end, Smith escapes prosecution. The Nite Owl gunmen are killed, as well as other conspirators in Smith's scheme. Bud White ends up a cripple. Jack Vincennes is killed in the line of duty while trying to stop prisoners from escaping. Ed Exley, now chief of detectives, loses his father, who commits suicide. Although they despised each other at first, Exley and White become friends. Exley swears to White he will bring Dudley Smith down. The final novel in the L.A. Quartet is White Jazz, told from corrupt LAPD officer Dave Klein's point of view. As a policeman, Klein has broken the law numerous times, beaten suspects, stolen, bribed, worked for the mob, and had people killed, as well as being a murderer himself. In late 1958, Klein, the commander of Administrative Vice, is assigned a burglary of the sanctioned drug-dealing family, the Kafesjians. Klein does not see the case as a priority, but Narcotics Division commander Dan Wilhite and Deputy Chief Ed Exley want the case solved. Klein takes a sideline job from Howard Hughes, who wants Klein to find evidence that would violate an actress's contract. Klein falls in love with his target, Glenda Bledsoe. While working the Kafesjian burglary, Klein discovers that Exley is still trying to bring down Dudley Smith. When he figures that out, Klein begins working with Exley, who tells him all about Dudley. When Klein meets an undercover officer, Johnny Duhamel, who is working Smith on behalf of Exley, Klein is shot up with drugs. Being coerced, Klein murders Duhamel with his Marine sword and is taped committing the murder. Klein is arrested by the FBI the following day for possession of heroin. He becomes a federal witness, and is given 48 hours before he is taken into custody. Klein and Exley discover other Dudley Smith sidelines, selling heroin to the South Los Angeles African-American population, keeping crime in that area \\"contained\\", gambling, and voyeuristic pornography tapes. Klein and Exley find the Kafesjians' burglar, Wylie Bullock. Later that night, everything hits Klein: all his crimes and everything that is happening. He decides to meet Smith later that night, who offered Klein a deal earlier. Unbeknownst to Smith, Klein brings Wylie Bullock, who has a grudge against Smith. When the two meet, Bullock attacks Smith, ripping out his eye and slashing his face ear to ear. Klein shoots Bullock and runs off. An all-points bulletin is issued on Klein and he is caught. A custody battle ensues between the FBI and the LAPD for Klein, which the FBI wins. While in federal custody, Klein writes a full confession of everything he has done, and everything that has happened. He has copies sent to Hush-Hush, the Los Angeles Times, and the State Attorney General's Office. However, Klein escapes custody. He hides out with Pete Bondurant (a character who reappears in the Underworld USA Trilogy series' American Tabloid and The Cold Six Thousand). After his escape, Klein's confessions fall on deaf ears, with only Hush-Hush magazine willing to print it. However, they are silenced by legal action and prevented from printing the confession that would have \\"brought the LAPD to its knees.\\" Howard Hughes feels betrayed by Dave Klein because of the Bledsoe job. He has Bondurant beat him up bad enough to require medical attention. Exley sends Klein a package in the hospital, which includes a blank passport and a gun. Exley says in his note that he considers Smith neutralized, but will allow Klein to kill Smith if he feels justice has not been absolute. Instead, Klein murders J. C. Kafesjian and Tommy Kafesjian. Klein spends one last night with Glenda Bledsoe, takes pictures of her to remember her by, and leaves for the airport. Around late January 1959, Klein leaves the United States. In the epilogue, set many years later (1976 at the earliest), Klein says he plans to return to Los Angeles, with the intentions of making gubernatorial candidate Exley confess to the manipulative deals he made, murder Dick Carlisle and Dudley Smith, and find his lover Glenda Bledsoe. Characters=Dudley Liam Smith Appearances: Clandestine, The Big Nowhere, L.A. Confidential, White Jazz, Perfidia, This Storm Smith was born in Dublin, Ireland in 1905, and later immigrated to the United States and was raised in Los Angeles, where he joined the LAPD in 1928. In The Big Nowhere, Dudley Smith is described as tall, beefside broad, and red-faced, with brown hair and brown eyes, as well as having a tenor brogue and being Jesuit college-trained. His verbal style also indicates he is a lexophile. In L.A. Confidential, Jack Vincennes tells Bud White and Edmund Exley that Dudley worked in the OSS in Paraguay after World War II. Also, in White Jazz a newspaper story mentions he was a World War II OSS spymaster, has a wife and five daughters, and has killed eight men in the line of duty. Smith was the clandestine protector of two rival criminal families, the Herricks and the Kafesjians, in the 1930s. In 1942 he murdered Jos√© Diaz in the infamous Sleepy Lagoon murder case. He is first mentioned in Clandestine, which is set in 1951, and again in 1950 in The Big Nowhere, where he is recruited by Deputy D.A. Ellis Loew to investigate communist influence in Hollywood. He and his partner Mal Considine pursue this assignment with vigor. It was in this book that the extent of his personal corruption was revealed; as well as Jos√© Diaz, Dudley and his men were involved in other criminal activities, and in February 1950 Dudley personally tracked down and killed protagonist Buzz Meeks as is stated in the prologue to L.A. Confidential. By 1950 Dudley had reached the rank of Lieutenant, and he would remain there throughout the 1950s, until his promotion to Captain in 1958. By this time, his personal rivalry with fellow LAPD Captain Edmund Exley resulted in a power struggle between both men, which Edmund Exley won when Smith was attacked by a man named Wylie Bullock. This attack left him with brain damage that rendered him essentially semi-lucid, and only rarely lucid. Also in the attack, he lost an eye, and is paralyzed, and will probably never be able to walk again. It is unknown when Dudley died; however, he is apparently still alive‚Äîalbeit confined to a nursing home‚Äîin 1976, as is revealed in the epilogue to White Jazz. He returns in Perfidia, set in 1941. Smith was thoroughly unscrupulous, ruthless, and evil. He had a large list of crimes that he had committed, including theft, pornography distribution, murder, and most disturbingly, infanticide‚ÄîDudley personally strangled the two-day-old baby of the Herrick family in 1937. He was a hard line anti-communist, declaring that he hated the \\"Red filth worse than Satan\\". Dudley's racism was also well known, particularly in regards to Jews, and he was a notable proponent of \\"containment\\"; as he explained it, keeping the \\"nigger filth\\" in African-American areas. Smith is portrayed by James Cromwell in the film adaptation of L.A. Confidential and portrayed in the 2003 television pilot of L.A. Confidential by Tom Nowicki. In a departure from the novel, Smith is killed by Exley at the end of a shootout. Edmund Jennings Exley Appearances: L.A. Confidential, White Jazz Ed Exley is one of the three protagonists in L.A. Confidential, and a major supporting character in White Jazz. He is the son of Preston Exley, former cop turned construction tycoon. The brother of Thomas Exley, also a cop who was gunned down by an unknown purse snatcher (referred to as \\"Rollo Tomasi\\" in the film, and kills Preston Exley, instead of Thomas Exley, in the film). Ed is relentlessly ambitious, politically savvy, and highly intelligent, trying to surpass his father as a policeman and live out late Thomas's dreams. He is instilled with a belief in \\"absolute justice\\" from his father. He has come from a family of cops. Stated in the novel Exley men have been police since the formation of the Scotland Yard. A summa cum laude graduate of UCLA at nineteen in 1941, Exley joined the war effort shortly after joining the LAPD in 1943. He served in the Pacific Theater and toward the end of his tour of duty experienced the variable ways of manipulating the truth to one's benefit. Anticipating an attack, Exley volunteers for a scout run. As predicted, the Japanese forces assault with a bayonet charge. When Exley returns, his platoon is dead and a patrol is approaching. He hides under the bodies of his former brothers-in-arms. After the patrol passes he decides to head to battalion headquarters. On the way, he passes a Shinto shrine of soldiers who committed suicide over capture or death by disease. He finds weaponry and a flamethrower nearby. He lays the guns out around the dead. With the flamethrower, he torches the bodies, knowing his cowardice would be evident and would be rotated to another platoon if he didn't commit this act. Recon finds Exley having \\"fought off\\" twenty-nine enemies. He is awarded the Distinguished Service Cross and his story is published in the Examiner. Exley's next brush with opportunity, chance and truth occurs on Christmas Eve during the Bloody Christmas Scandal of 1951. A rise in rank and glory come with his testimony against his brother officers, but not without the stigma of becoming a turncoat and pariah. A hate relationship develops with Bud White, due to his testifying and because White's partner, Dick Stensland, is incarcerated and, later, goes to the gas chamber. Exley was the arresting officer in the crimes which led to Stensland receiving the death penalty, and was in attendance (as was White) when Stensland was executed. The Nite Owl slayings, however, bring him acceptance. Several patrons of an all-night coffee shop are brutally shotgunned to death. Although in custody, the suspects escape. Exley finds them and guns them down although they were unarmed. As the years pass, Exley is given captaincy over Internal Affairs. He also makes other numerous cases with a conviction rate in the upper ninety percent. When the Nite Owl case is reopened due to the circumstantial evidence of two witnesses, Exley and the rest of the LAPD must solve the case all over again before the Attorney General's Office takes over the investigation and makes the LAPD look incompetent. As the evidence emerges and connections are established between the suspects in a web of complex conspiracies (stretching back decades), it becomes clear that his father himself did not properly clear his own famous case, The Loren Atherton case. With the aid of Bud White and Jack Vincennes, the trio ultimately solve the Nite Owl Case. Following a botched raid on a prison break via train, White is critically wounded. Exley visits him and finds evidence White built for his own case against a serial killer of prostitutes. When Exley finds the evidence, he learns the true meaning of absolute justice: anonymous, humble, no rank or glory. While conventional justice is not meted out, with Exley entrusting the second murderer of the Loren Atherton case to a known doctor, Dr. Terry Lux, and the ultimate mastermind behind the Nite Owl and other crimes, Dudley Smith cannot be convicted due to lack of evidence, Exley vows he will take down Dudley Smith if it's the last thing he ever does. In White Jazz Exley is a deputy chief as a result of solving the Nite Owl. He has become colder and more determined in achieving his goals. He unwillingly allows Dave Klein to keep his job, despite Klein's obvious corruption. Exley continues his crusade in attempting to take down Dudley Smith. He uses an undercover police cadet and Klein to attain this goal. During a burglary into Exley's house for monetary gain, Klein finds numerous photos of Dudley Smith. Klein calls the photos \\"Exley hate fuel\\". During an earlier meeting at Exley's house, Klein mentions that as evil as Dudley is, Exley is a hypocrite in the way he uses people like Dudley. White Jazz sees the end of the corrupt Narcotics Division and its sanctioned dealers, the Kafesjians. Due to severe brain damage and wounds, Dudley remains in hospital care his whole life and a special pension fund approved by Exley himself, since the revelations about the LAPD's blatant corruption would \\"bring the LAPD to its knees\\", as stated in Hush-Hush. With Klein a fugitive, Exley gets word to him in a package. It states he will not pursue Klein for his burglary because he used Klein to accomplish his mission.

During the regiment's dissolve on December 31, 1941, the legionnaires of the 6th Foreign Infantry Regiment were assigned to the later reconstituted 1st Foreign Marching Infantry Regiment (, 1er R.E.I.M) and the Marching Regiment of the Foreign Legion (, R.M.L.E). On June 7, 1949, the 3rd battalion of the 6th Foreign Infantry Regiment embarked for Indochina and transformed to the 1st battalion of the 5th Foreign Infantry Regiment () on October 31. The 6th Foreign Infantry Regiment participated to the operations of maintaining order. The regiment notably engaged in the battles of djebel Selloum, Kasserine and djebel Gouleb. the 6th Foreign Infantry Regiment was dissolved for the second time on June 30, 1955 when the French Foreign Legion was in phase of reorganization following the return from Indochina.  Creation of the 6th Foreign Engineer Regiment (6e REG)  6th Foreign Engineer Regiment (1984‚Äì1999) The 1st Foreign Engineer Regiment (1er R√©giment Etranger de G√©nie), 1er REG) was created in 1984 as the 6th Foreign Engineer Regiment. On July 1, 1984, Foreign Legion Groupment, G.L.E Commander, g√©n√©ral Jean-Claude Coullon assisted to the patronization ceremony marking the enacting of the 6th Foreign Engineer Regiment, 6e R.E.G. For the first time in Legion history, the colors of a French foreign legion regiment included the inscription \\"G√©nie\\". Accordingly, the 6th Foreign Engineer Regiment ( 6e R.E.G ) received the regimental colors on October 12, 1984. The creation of the 6th Foreign Engineer Regiment ( 6e R.E.G ) was delayed with a doubtful bet. The Legion had a long history of Fortification construction (), however, had little experience in combat engineering assault. The whites cadres combat engineer assault specialist of the general regime, a part component of the Military Combat Engineer Assault () of the French Army brought forth their precious savoir-faire and formed the legionnaires in the various fields of specialties. Material arrived and the units prowled. The combat section and companies of the 6e REG deployed in missions of short duration in Mayotte, Guyane, the Central African Republic and very quickly the regiment gained its first combat experience. For the actions of 6th Foreign Engineer Regiment ( 6e R.E.G ) in Tchad at Faya-Largeau in 1987, the 1st combat company was cited at the orders of the armed forces with the Croix de la Valeur militaire. In the same theater of combat engagement, Sergent-Chef Panic was killed by an Anti- tank mine on January 14, 1988 during a mission of opening and clearing the route. In 1989, a detachment of the 6th Foreign Engineer Regiment trained Pakistanis in demining during Operation Salam in Pakistan. At Laudun, the mood and mode of the regiment was accelerated by the dispatching of combat companies, sections and small separate detachments tasked with punctual missions. In 1990, for the first time, the entire regiment intervened. In Iraq and Kuwait, the 6th Foreign Engineer Regiment participated to the victorious offensive of the Division Daguet part of Op√©ration Daguet and was seen cited at the orders of the armed forces with Croix de guerre des th√©√¢tres d'op√©rations ext√©rieures with a palm. During the Gulf War, D.I.N.O.P.S operated in support of the U.S. Army's 82nd Airborne Division, and provided the EOD services to the division. After the cease fire took hold they conducted a joint mine clearing operation alongside a Royal Australian Navy Clearance Diver Team Unit. Barely in return to Laudun, combat companies were seen redispatched to new theatres of combat operations. The regiment would be found in Cambodia, Bosnia, Somalia, Rwanda, Kosovo and other geographical locations.

The narrator, Jim Jones, is found guilty of poaching and sentenced to transportation to the penal colony of New South Wales. En route, his ship is attacked by pirates, but the crew holds them off. When the narrator remarks that he would rather have joined the pirates or indeed drowned at sea than gone to Botany Bay, Jones is reminded by his captors that any mischief will be met with the whip. In the final verse, Jones describes the daily drudgery and degradation of life as a convict in Australia, and dreams of joining the bushrangers (escaped convicts turned outlaws) and taking revenge on his floggers.http://folkstream.com/050.html Australian folklorists such as Bill Scott date the song's composition to the years immediately preceding 1830 when bushranger Jack Donahue, who is named in the song, was fatally shot by troopers. The oldest surviving written version of the ballad is found in Old Pioneering Days in the Sunny South (1907), a book of reminiscences by Charles McAlister, a pioneer who drove bullock teams in southern-eastern New South Wales in the 1840s. According to folklorist A. L. Lloyd, \\"Jim Jones at Botany Bay\\" may have been lost to history had McAlister not included it in his book.\\"Sleeve notes to The Great Australian Legend, A Panorama of Bush Balladry and Song; A.L. Lloyd, Trevor Lucas & Martyn Wyndham-Read, Topic Records TSDL203 McAlister said \\"Jim Jones at Botany Bay\\" was sung to the tune of \\"Irish Molly O\\".Charles MacAlister, Old Pioneering Days in the Sunny South http://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-52777702/view?partId=nla.obj-244136796#page/n87/mode/1up pp 72-3 Others consider it likely that it was sung to the tune of the Irish rebel song \\"Skibbereen\\". Lyrics One version of the traditional lyrics is shown below. Come gather round and listen lads, and hear me tell m' tale, How across the sea from England I was condemned to sail. The jury found me guilty, and then says the judge, says he, Oh for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you across the stormy sea. But take a tip before you ship to join the iron gang, Don't get too gay in Botany Bay, or else you'll surely hang. \\"Or else you'll surely hang\\", he says, and after that, Jim Jones, Way up high upon yon gallows tree, the crows will pick your bones. There's no time for mischief there, remember that, they say Oh they'll flog the poaching out of you down there in Botany Bay. With the storms a-raging round us, and the winds a-blowing gales I'd rather drowned in misery than gone to New South Wales. Our ship was high upon the seas when pirates came along, But the soldiers on our convict ship were full five hundred strong; They opened fire and so they drove that pirate ship away But I'd rather joined that pirate ship than gone to Botany Bay. Day and night in irons clad we like poor galley slaves Will toil and toil our lives away to fill dishonored graves But by and by I'll slip m' chains and to the bush I'll go And I'll join the brave bushrangers there, Jack Donahue and Co. And some dark night all is right and quiet in the town, I'll get the bastards one and all, I'll gun the floggers down. I'll give them all a little treat, remember what I say And they'll yet regret they sent Jim Jones in chains to Botany Bay.

In particular it regulated the right of intermarrying into another city-state. In the period of Athenian democracy, such intermarriage was not allowed, and only a decree of the popular assembly could permit it. Even resident aliens (metoeci) did not have the right to marry Athenians. Epigamia was also a way of formalizing the relationship between different nations. Typically, an epigamia agreement would allow the adoption of the nationality of the country of residence, for the spouse as well as children. For example, Athens granted epigamia to Euboa in the 5th century, a very rare case. Some cases are known (especially through Plutarch), in which epigamia was denied between two villages of Attica, Pallene and Hagnous, presumably because alliances would have been akin to endogamy. In 303 BCE, Seleucus I led an army to the Indus in India, where he encountered Chandragupta. The confrontation ended with a peace treaty, and \\"an intermarriage agreement\\" (epigamia), meaning either a dynastic marriage or a more general agreement for intermarriage between Indians and Greeks. Accordingly, Seleucus ceded to Chandragupta his northwestern territories as far as Arachosia and received 500 war elephants (which played a key role in the victory of Seleucus at the Battle of Ipsus): :\\"The Indians occupy [in part] some of the countries situated along the Indus, which formerly belonged to the Persians: Alexander deprived the Ariani of them, and established there settlements of his own.

Messenger and Annie (n√©e Atkinson). He was an Australian rugby league footballer who played in the 1910s and into the 1920s. He was a state and national representative er whose club career was played with Eastern Suburbs in the New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership. The younger brother of league great Dally Messenger, Wally Messenger won premierships with Easts in NSWRFL season 1912 and NSWRFL season 1913, playing with his brother as captain. He made two Test appearances for Australia's National Rugby League team, The Kangaroos in the 1914 domestic Ashes series, kicking three goals on debut and scoring a try in the deciding test of the series. He represented for New South Wales in one match against Queensland also in 1914. For the 1915 season, he was the NSW Rugby Football League's top point-scorer. Wally Messenger is listed on the Australian Players Register as Kangaroo No.93.ARL Annual Report 2005, page 52 Early Life Wally Messenger, the youngest of the eight children of Charles Amos Messenger, was part of an \\"era of sporting achievement\\" of the Double Bay Public School. Both Wally and his older brother Dally (by seven years) were coached by an enthusiastic and dedicated teacher John Moclair, encouraged by principal Henry Giles Shaw (1891-1896). For many years they ensured that the Rugby team was undefeated in inter-schools competitions at Junior level. They quite often defeated teams from the Senior Schools competition as well, including a victory over the Fort Street High School, winners of the senior competition. The Relationship between the brothers: Wally and Dally In the course of history Wally Messenger‚Äôs achievements have been somewhat eclipsed by the fame of his older brother Dally. Yet at the time of Wally‚Äòs rugby league career Dally supported and lauded Wally‚Äôs sporting development in every way he could. Dally encouraged his seven years younger brother Wally, when he played Australian Rules Football at the Double Bay School, and in a local Australian rules competition in 1906, when Wally was sixteen. The Arrow described Wally ‚Äúas nimble and as clever as footballers are made.‚Äú Wally then switched to Rugby League. In 1912 Wally entered first grade in an Eastern Suburbs match against South Sydney. The brothers played thereafter together at top level. Dally, normally the team‚Äôs goal kicker, often shared the kicks with Wally. ‚ÄúHe is not as unorthodox as his brother,‚Äù said The Referee, but he has the power to field and kick the ball with infinitely greater skill than the average player.‚Äù The Referee described Wally as having ‚Äúinfinitely greater skill than the average player. He is a strongly built tricky young man, and is very dangerous.‚Äú Wally played two tests for Australia in 1914. Tragically, the First World War (1914-1918) intervened and put a stop to his very promising football future. Dally is quoted as saying: ‚Äú... given my opportunities, Wally would have been a world beater.‚Äù The Rorke‚Äôs Drift Rugby League Test Match of 1914 Wally MessengerWally Messenger was prominent in perhaps the most legendary game of Rugby League ever chronicled. It was described as Rorke's Drift, an analogy to an outnumbered embattled group of British soldiers in Southern Africa who won a victory over a much larger and formidable army of Zulu warriors (1879). It was the third Test Match of Australia versus Great Britain, played in Sydney on the July 4, 1914.

Written by Doug Ellin, and directed by David Frankel, it originally aired on HBO in the United States on July 18, 2004. It received positive reviews and was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series Plot The episode opens with Turtle walking into a restaurant, greeting every female by name as he goes. When he meets up with the group, he tells Vince to sign a poster for Head On (Vince's new movie co-starring Jessica Alba). When asked why, Turtle explains that it's for the girl who hooks the group up with all of their Nike shoes. The group then engages in a discussion of how bad promo photos can sink an actor's career, until two extremely attractive females walk by and Turtle starts to harass them. After the girls leave, the group discusses whether or not they should attend their high school reunion back in New York City, and their disapproval of Eric's on again / off again girlfriend Kristen. Next the guys head to the premiere of Head On, where Johnny \\"Drama\\" tries to get out of the limo before Vince. As the guys walk up the red carpet and comment on the girls in attendance, Eric tells Turtle to go and make sure that Ali Larter is not sitting within ten rows of Vince. When Vince has a reporter take his picture with his brother Drama, the photographer can't place where he knows Drama from. When Eric tells Vince to go take a picture with Alan, Vince is unsure of who that is, and Eric has to remind him that Alan is the man who financed Head On. While Vince takes the pictures, Ari starts harassing Eric to get Vince to read the script for Matterhorn, a buddy cop type movie set in Disneyland. Ari promises court side Los Angeles Lakers tickets if Eric gets Vince to read the script. While they are talking, Turtle interrupts to tell \\"E\\" that he's lined up a \\"revenge fuck\\" who looks just like his ex, Kristen, and who's apparently told Turtle that she \\"puts out\\". As Turtle describes the girl, Ali Larter comes over and looks very annoyed, and then proceeds to aggressively quiz Eric on Vince's whereabouts. We are left to assume that there was a relationship that went sour between Vince and Ali. After the premiere the guys head back to their house with some girls in tow for a pool party. The guys spend time trying to get with each girl. The next morning Drama and Turtle pester Eric with tales of how the girls they ended up with the night before performed in bed, and try to get Eric to talk about how his was. When Vince comes down, Eric asks Vince if he's read the script for Matterhorn yet. Vince says no, and asks E what he thought of it. When Eric says he thought it sucked, Vince says \\"OK. I trust you\\", then explains how he never read the script for Head On and didn't know who the killer was until he saw the film the night before. The guys then take a trip to the Warner Brothers studio to meet with the director for Matterhorn. On the way, Turtle tells the guys about Arnold the rottweiler he is getting for Vince from Black Hack. As they walk into the studio, we learn that Drama is Vince's half- brother and that Vince and Turtle originally moved to Hollywood to follow Johnny around. Just before they walk in, the guys exchange greetings with Mark Wahlberg. When the guys get back home, they discuss the meeting with the director, and Ari calls to tell Vince that the director loved him and wants to sign him to do Matterhorn for $4 million. Vince asks Eric what he thinks, and E tells him he thinks it's time Vince read the script. While Vince struggles to read the script, the guys hit golf balls into the neighborhood, trying to hit the homes of other actors, such as Pierce Brosnan. After a while the guys switch from golf to basketball while Vince finishes reading the script. After reading it, he still has the same opinion, that is Eric was right and the script sucks but the $4 million would be sweet. When Ari calls, Vince tells him what Eric thinks of the script but Ari doesn't care. Vince, however, values Eric's opinion and tells Ari to talk to E about it (even though E wants to talk to Ari even less than Ari wants to talk to E). Ari decides to have dinner with Eric to discuss Vince's future. Vince likes this as now he won't always have to \\"be in the middle of things\\". The dog arrives but the guys are too afraid to take it out of the cage so they have Turtle dress up in full hockey gear as they open the cage from the second story of the house via a draw string. At dinner Eric and Ari spar with verbal insults and discuss why Eric doesn't think that Vince should do Matterhorn. Eric threatens to slap Ari if he ever insults him again and we learn that two years prior Vince couldn't get a call back from Ari. After dinner Eric passes out watching SportsCenter, and Turtle and Drama wake him up to get ready to go to Las Vegas. Eric doesn't want to go so they tell him that his ex-girlfriend Kristen is sleeping with Vince Vaughn. Eric believes them at first then realizes (thanks to Drama's overacting) that they are lying to him. Vince enters the room and takes Eric aside to find out why he threatened Ari and tells him he can't do that. Eric explains that Ari was being condescending (in particular deriding his former role as a manager at Sbarro), so Vince asks if Eric thinks he should fire Ari. Eric sarcastically says yes and Vince begins to make the call. When Eric sees this, he stops him and Vince tells E he wants him to make his decisions. From this point, Eric is now his unofficial manager. After this, Vince and E decide not to go to Vegas. Vince also wants to skip the reunion but Eric is looking forward to it and wants to go and convinces Vince go as well. The next day, the guys are getting ready to head to the airport and Eric asks Turtle if he got the Bose headsets. Turtle has no clue what E is talking about, and Eric berates him to go get them. After Turtle gets in the car, Vince asks Eric what that was about as he didn't ask for any headsets. Eric points at the car and says \\"you also don't want to ride in a car that has that on it\\". As Turtle drives off we see a bumper sticker on the back of the car that reads \\"I ‚ô• Cock\\", as E reminds Drama that he's next. Ari calls again and Vince hands the phone to E. Eric answers and Ari asks for Vince. E tells him Vince wants them to talk instead. Ari then tells him that Colin Farrell took Matterhorn. When Eric breaks the word to Vince he says, \\"I hope you know what you're doing, pizza boy.\\" Production The pilot was written by series creator Doug Ellin and directed by David Frankel. On reading the script, Frankel was concerned that Ferrara was too young for the role of Turtle, Dillon was too old to play Drama, and Grenier was very unlike Wahlberg/Vince. Furthermore, Connolly was ambivalent about his part. However, Frankel was impressed by the group once all together and felt that Connolly's sincerity boosted the show. Ellin's first version of the script had the show beginning at the movie premiere, with no-one liking Vince's acting but none willing to tell him. HBO executives rejected this version, and urged Ellin to make it more upbeat. Mark Wahlberg's entourage in this episode includes the real life Turtle, Eric, and Johnny. Reception The pilot was initially broadcast on July 18, 2004 in the United States on HBO. Phil Gallo of Variety was critical of the episode, citing what he perceived as a lack of subtext and bland characters. However, he praised Piven's giving Ari Gold \\"an intensity and a moral void that gets better with each episode\\", and foreshadowed what he saw as better writing by episode 3. Conversely, Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle cited the show's and characters' soullessness as reasons the show is entertaining. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly gave the episode an A-, describing it as \\"excellent, dirty fun\\", praising the casting, in particular Dillon and Piven. Frankel received a 2005 Emmy nomination for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series for his work on this episode.

Design of the rolling chassis was by Ray Turner. Walter Belgrove, who had styled the pre-war Triumphs and was employed as Chief Body Engineer, had no part in the design. Early post-war steel shortages meant that the body was built from aluminium, using rubber press tools that had been used making panels for the largely wooden bodied Mosquito bomber that had been built by Standard during the war. The frame was hand welded up from steel tube. The engine was a version of Standard's 1.5-litre, four-cylinder side-valve design that had been converted to overhead valves by Harry Weslake and built by Standard exclusively for SS-Jaguar before World War II. The Triumph version featured a downdraught Solex carburettor instead of the Jaguar's side-draught SU, and a 6.7:1 compression ratio instead of 7.6:1. A four-speed gearbox with synchromesh on the top three ratios was used. The tubular steel chassis was a short-wheelbase version of the 1800 saloon, featuring transverse leaf sprung independent suspension at the front and a live axle with semi-elliptic springs at the rear. The rear track was wider than the front by some 4 inches. Brakes were hydraulic. 1946 Triumph 1800 Roadster The body design was anachronistic. A journalist old enough to remember the pre-war Dolomite Roadster that had inspired the car felt that the elegant proportions of the earlier model had been abandoned in favour of a committee-based compromise, \\"a plump Christmas turkey to set against that dainty peacock ... [more] Toadster [than Roadster]\\". The front had large separate headlamps and the radiator was well back from the front between large \\"coal scuttle\\" wings. Passenger accommodation was on a bench seat that was claimed to seat three: the car's 64 inch width helped make a reality of the three-abreast seating, and the approach meant a column gear change was required. The car's unusual width also made it necessary to fit three screen wipers in a row, an example followed by early shallow windscreen Jaguar E Types. Additional room for two was provided at the rear in a dickey seat with its own folding windscreen: this was outside the hood that could be erected to cover the front seat. Entry and exit to the dickey seat was never easy and a step was provided on the rear bumper. The Roadster was the last production car with a dickey seat. On test by Autocar magazine in 1947 top speed was found to be and 0‚Äì60 mph (0‚Äì96 km/h) took 34.4 seconds. Evidently keen to be positive without misleading their readers, the magazine described the maximum speed as \\"satisfying but not startlingly high\\".

Two cars were actually used over the duration of the series production. This was made evident by the colour difference of the front mudguards and body without hood ornament on one car used in the earlier series and the same colour front mudguards and body with the hood ornament on the other car used in later series. The same number plate J 1610 was used on both cars in the series. In some episodes both cars appeared purporting to be the same car. Triumph 2000 Roadster (TRA) The only significant upgrade in the Roadster's production came in September 1948 for the 1949 models, when the 2088 cc Vanguard engine, transmission, and rear axle were fitted. With the larger engine the four-speed gearbox was replaced with a three-speed unit, even though it now had synchromesh on bottom gear. Apart from minor modifications to the mounting points, the chassis, suspension and steering were unaltered. This later version of the Roadster was given the model designation 20TR. On test the changes resulted in the top speed increasing marginally to but the 0-60 mph time was much better at 27.9 seconds. The car was never made in large numbers and was mainly hand built. 2501 examples of the 1800 and 2000 of the larger-engined version were made. Production ended in October 1949.

Jeyhun was born in Shusha, and was a brother of the great composer Uzeyir Hajibeyov. After graduating from the Russian-Tatar Azeri school in Shusha, he continued his education in Baku. Later he went to St. Petersburg under the sponsorship of oil baron millionaire Murtuza Mukhtarov where he entered the Law Department of the university there. After this, he continued his education at the Sorbonne University in Paris. For many years in Paris, he was one of the two most active authors of Kaspi Newspaper. For some time he was the editor of the daily literary-social newspaper called \\"Azerbaydjan\\" published in Russian. Exile Jeyhun Hajibeyli (left) with his brother Uzeyir Hajibeyov (right) In 1919 Jeyhun Hajibeyli went to France as a member of the delegation led by Alimardan Topchubashev to take part in the Versailles Peace Conference. Due to the political events that took place in Baku and throughout Azerbaijan in 1920, he was not able to return to Baku and had to live out his life in France never to return. Jeyhun bey brought his Motherland that he always longed for and carried in his dreams, with him to France. He lived two lives in Paris. One was the real Paris life, the other one was the life related to his Motherland which he created in his dreams and longings and memories. Dreaming was the only way he could ‚Äúcommunicate with his dear ones‚Äù because all mail was cut off. He wrote in his diary: > \\"Yes, I have to admit that during these 40 years of separation from my dear > ones that I have often longed for my sisters; and sometimes the images of my > mom and my middle brother (Uzeyir) replaced the images of my sisters in my > mind. Both of them were crying bitterly when we were saying good-bye. I was > trying to convince them that I was going away for only two months. I was > asking them why they were crying? Now I tell myself, Jeyhun bey, you > deceived them because you yourself were not aware of what would happen. Now > you‚Äôre living 41 years separated from them. You never saw them again nor > will you ever see them in the future - your dear ones‚Äîmen and women are > passing away one by one... And you yourself will, too.\\" It turns out that especially the remaining years of his 43 years living in exile were so sad. Jeyhun Hajibeyli. Munich (Late 1950s) Hajibeyli died in Paris in 1962 and was buried there. Uzeyir Hajibeyov died in 1948. In 1990 Azerbaijani diplomat Ramiz Abutalibov brought Jeyhun's archive to Baku from France and presented it to the Central State Literature and Art Archives. This archive consists of 20 folders. There are approximately 500 articles in those folders. It was discovered from these documents that Jeyhun Hajibeyli also wrote narratives and stories, and was involved in scientific research work. He also carried out interesting research on Azerbaijan's history, ethnography, folklore, literature and language. He also wrote the narrative, \\"Haji Karimin Sahari\\" (\\"The Morning of Haji Karim\\") which was published in the Kaspi newspaper in Baku. In 1925 ‚ÄúArshin Mal Alan‚Äù, the musical operetta written by Uzeyir Hajibeyov was staged at the Women's Theater in France based on Jeyhun Hajibeyli's translation and staging. Accomplishments As an academic, Jeyhun Hajibeyli's had a very broad range of interests. He did research on \\"Babak and Ancient State of Arran\\" and \\"The History of Baku and Barda\\". He also wrote articles about the creative work of the great Persian writers Ferdowsi and Shirazi. One of the most valuable of his works is Karabakh's Dialect and Folklore. Bayram Aghayev, a member of the staff of the Nizami Literature Institute who is a Philology Sciences Candidate prepared this work for publication that had previously been released in Paris in Asia Magazine in 1934. From the first words that Jeyhun Hajibeyli wrote in this monograph, we can see that he had begun work on this Karabakh Folklore volume prior to the Revolution (1920) when he was still in his Motherland. In Paris, he would enrich his work with new material that he gathered. This work was written at the request of famous Turkologist V. V. Radlov (1837‚Äì1918) who played a historical role in deciphering the Orkhan-Yenisey literary monument. The Karabakh Folklore volume was written for a special publication ‚Äî A Collection of Turkish-Tatar Dialects that Radlov was organizing. After the academician died, his successor the famous Orientalist, Professor A. N. Samoylovich studied the short research and praised it in an article. But because of World War I, provocations brought on by Armenian Dashnaks and Russian Bolsheviks against Azerbaijan in the Caucasus, finally Azerbaijan's was forced to become part of the Soviet Union. Consequently, Jeyhun's scientific work about this region could not be published. Hajibeyli had to seek asylum in France isolated from the sphere of Russian Orientalists‚Äô that he had developed networks and connections with and also separated from his native land Karabakh, Azerbaijan which was the object of his research. In order to present his work to the Collection of Turkish-Tatar Dialects, the author wrote his work in Russian and prepared the examples about Karabagh's dialect, folklore and ethnography in the Cyrillic alphabet (although Arabic script was the official alphabet in Azerbaijan those days). But later in order to present his work to the French scientific community, Hajibeyli again had to revise his work and convert all the samples to Latin transcription. This concise collection is a good source for Europeans who want to learn about the East and about the Azeri language, about Azerbaijan and about the ethnography of its inseparable part‚ÄîKarabakh. It includes both general and specific information about our traditions, national literature and dialects. Up until that time such information was not known in France and Russia, nor even in Azerbaijan as it had not been researched and published systematically. Karabakh folklore consists of 33 small sections‚Äîbayatis, praises, supplications, threats, vows, elegies, lullabies, endearments, jokes, humorous anecdotes used by ordinary people. Hajibeyli also showed the phonetic features of Karabakh dialect and its typical features and compares them with dialects from other Azerbaijani regions. References *Bakir Nabiyev and Bayram Aghayev.

It is now part of Western Sussex Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. History The hospital has its origins in a facility named after Richard de Wych, a former Bishop of Chichester, commissioned by West Sussex County Council in 1937 and built between 1938 and 1939. At the start of the Second World War the Government designated it an Emergency Medical Service hospital and, by 1940, ten hutted wards had been added, taking the number of beds to 594. After the hospital joined the National Health Service in 1948, the Postgraduate Medical Education Centre opened on the hospital site in 1966 and new accident and emergency, outpatient, x-ray and maternity departments were completed in 1970. Donald Wilson House, the hospital's neurological rehabilitation unit, opened in 1975 and the intensive care unit and coronary care unit followed in 1977. After the hospital attained NHS Trust status in 1994, a new building, containing wards, physiotherapy and operating theatres was completed in 1996. In May 2008, the West Sussex Primary Care Trust Board recommended that Worthing Hospital be the 'major general hospital' for West Sussex and that St Richard's Hospital be downgraded. A new children's ward was completed in February 2011. In April 2014 the maternity unit was awarded the prestigious 'level three' award under the Clinical Negligence Scheme for Trusts and in 2016 the hospital was rated as 'Outstanding' by the Care Quality Commission although they reported that the hospital's responsiveness required improvement. Services The hospital has approximately 430 beds, including six ITU beds, a high dependency unit and a maternity unit. There is an accident and emergency department. The Chichester Treatment Centre treats patients on a day care basis. The hospital has an NHS fertility clinic which also treats some private patients.

Some considerable confusion exists about the sites and naming of these 'castles' in Stewarton. The printed name 'Revincraige' arose as a printed spelling error from the original manuscript's 'Reuinscraige' i.e. stone ruins, so it isn't a name, it's a description used in the locality. Dobie goes on to state that following the correction \\"that the real and original name of this castle ... was Ruincraig cannot for a moment be entertained...\\"Dobie, James D. (ed Dobie, J.S.)

Glasgow: John Tweed. p.367 We know from historical records about Godfrey de Ross and his family of Corsehill Castle, they were Lords of Liddesdale in the Borders and later on the Cunninghams became the holders. The later Corsehill (also Crosshill) House stood on the east side of the Corsehill or Clerkland Burn and only a few remains were said to exist to show its site, however the 1860 OS indicates no ruins of any description and nothing now remains on the site (2015).

Later churches were built and the crosses abandoned. } Corsehill House is shown in one old print of 1791, drawn in 1789 by GroseGrose, p.215 with the comment that \\"At a small distance from this ruin are some small remains of a more ancient building belonging to the same family.\\" referring to the old Corsehill castle whilst drawing Corsehill House, the home of the laird at that time. Substantial remains of Corsehill House were thought to exist until the railway was constructed and that most of the ruins were used to build the embankment with the course of the burn also being partly altered at this time, however a contemporary record states that the Corsehill House site had been entirely robbed by circa 1800. Armstrong's 1775 map clearly shows Corsehill as being on the east bank of the Corsehill Burn. The single section of tower wall that remains today (2006) of Old Corsehill had extensive consolidation works to stabilise it and this gives it its unusual appearance, accentuated by the existence of a fireplace and aumbry on the eastern side. No recorded explanation for the carrying out of these quite extensive and expensive works has yet come to light, however some consolidations were made around the time of the construction of the railway that runs close by and secondly William Cunninghame of Lainshaw had the financial means. The dressed stone work blocks reveals that two phases of consolidation were carried out, probably years apart. the lower level appears as possible robbed dressed ashlar from Corsehill House and the second phase is distinguished by a raised rectangular area, typically intended to empasise that this is not original work. A number of authorsCuthbertson p.178Canmore Site - Corsehill Castle have assumed that the surviving remnant of the typical tower castle equates to a distinctive part of Grose's engraving however the thickness at nearly 3 metres and the other features such as the lack of a fire-place and aumbry, of this clearly later building together with map evidence suggests otherwise and in addition the OS map evidence suggests a typical square or oblong tower castle shapedAyr Sheet XIII.5 (Stewarton) Survey date: 1856. Publication date: 1858 building rather than a relatively unfortified laird's house with relatively thin walls, many doors at ground level, large windows, etc. akin to buildings such as the Place of Auchinleck. Canmore gives measurements for the Corsehill Castle tower remnant as nearly 3m thick and 10m high.[vhttps://canmore.org.uk/site/42919/corsehill-castle Canmore - Corsehill Castle] If the 'tower' in Frances Grose's engraving was that of the castle then the wall remnants associated with it would have to be at least 10m high and six or more stone courses thick, which the engravong does not show. With these measurements Corsehill House would have been a very large building indeed. The footprint of Corshill House as shown by the engraving also seems far too large for the knoll on which the surviving remnant of Old Corsehill Castle still stands. The 1779 map by Crawford does not indisputably show Corsehill as a ruin although by this time the lands of Cocklebie have extended across the once prestigious avenue of trees.Crawford (1779) Fullarton in 1858 records that \\"..the ancient castellated mansion of Coreshill has been wholly removed - not a stone now remaining to mark its site; nor does any vestige of its garden or other decorations remain to procalim its former state and fallen grandeur.\\". He goes on to state that the site was well remembered, the last parts of the building having been removed around 1800 and that a fine avenue of magnificent trees used to run down into Stewarton. Herman Moll's map of 1745 shows a 'Reuinsk' to the west of the Clerkland Burn and 'Corshill' to the west of itMoll (1745) whilst Roy's map of 1747 shows a square shaped 'Old Crosshill' with a 'U' shaped 'Crosshill' to the west of the burn together with a 'mains' farm.Roy (1747) Armstrong's 1775 map shows 'Ruins' and 'Corshill' depicted as a house standing to the west of it.Armstrong (1775) Dobie categorically states that no records in Ayrshire exist of a 'Ravencraig Castle' and goes on to record that the building on the west side of the Corsehill Burn has been a ruin since 1608 and that the area it stands in was once called 'Corsehill Park.Dobie, p.367 It is worth noting that the Scots for a raven (Corvus corax) is a 'Corbie'. The Online Scots Dictionary ‚Äî Translate English to Scots Corsehill Castle showing the two phases of consolidation stonework The Blaeu map of 1654 based on Timothy Pont's earlier map gives 'Reuinskraig on the west side of the Clerkland Burn and 'Corshill' on the east side. Both are depicted the same without any clear suggestion of 'Reuinskraig' being a ruin.1654 - Joan Blaeu - CVNINGHAMIA - Cunningham. The 1779 estate map of Lainshaw shows Corsehill as a relatively small and apparently intact property on the east bank of the Corsehill/Clerkland Burn, reached by a road branching off at Cocklebie, running across the top of what is now the Cunninghame-Watt Park and turning uphill to reach the house. An avenue of trees ran down to the town, however this was interrupted by some of the Cocklebie lands which are not shown planted up. The ruined castle is shown as just the surviving part of the tower and it is otherwise unnamed. The whole area is called the Corsehill lands. Surprisingly only ten years after the estate map was surveyed Grose shows Corsehill House as an abandoned and much robbed ruin. The 1828 map of Ayrshire by William Johnson only records Corsehill lying on the east side of the burn.Johnson (1828) The 1776 map by Taylor & Skinner shows a 'Corsehill' only as a dwelling house held by Sir William Cunynhame (sic).G Taylor and A Skinner's Survey and maps of the roads of North Britain or Scotland, 1776 The remains of the dam on the Corsehill Burn. A 1789 View of Corsehill House, engraved in 1791 and published in 1797. Nothing remained of Corsehill House after circa 1800. The old Corsehill Castle and Corsehill House (NS 416 415) were separate entities and a vague memory may persist of Templehouse and its fortalice at Darlington on the lands of Corsehill Farm, causing some extra confusion. (see below) Many references can be found to Corsehill/Corshill or even Crosshill in old records, none for 'Ravenscraig', but several for 'Reuincraig', although as stated, this is just a description of a ruin that was called 'Corsehill', 'ruined Corsehill'. Archibald AdamsonAdamson, Page 156. in his 'Rambles Round Kilmarnock' of 1875 makes no mention of the name Ravenscraig, calling the site he visited Corsehill. Aitken only marks Crosshill Castle in 1829 on the west side of the Corsehill Burn. The first OS maps show only the surviving castle's site. To sum up, the map in Pont's 'Cuninghame' of 1604 - 8 shows two buildings, \\"Reuincraige\\" and \\"Corshill\\", at approximately NS 417 467 and NS 422 465 respectively, and Dobie comments that the two have often been confused, but that \\"Reuincraig\\" stood on the west side of the Corsehill Burn and \\"Corsehill Mansion\\" on its east. \\"Reuincraig\\", he says, was \\".. so modernised about 1840 that it was difficult to realise that it had been ruined in 1608\\", while the ruins of 'Corsehill House' were removed about the beginning of the 19th century and only foundations could be traced when he wrote. He also thought that \\"Reuincraig\\" (i.e. Ruin Craig) was not an original name. If Dobie is correct, the ruins published as \\"Corsehill Castle\\" on the OS 6\\", must be those of \\"Reuincraig\\", both because they are standing remains, and because they are on the west bank of the burn. MacGibbon and Ross, describe Corsehill Castle at the end of the 19th century as a very ruinous mansion of a late date and apparently of an 'L-plan', belonging to the period 1542-1700 so they must be referring to Corsehill House. Grose, in 1797,Grose, Page 215 published an illustration of 'Corshill House', but does not give its exact location. He mentions that \\"at a small distance from this ruin are some small remains of a more ancient building belonging to the same family\\", he is therefore referring to 'Old Corsehill Castle'.MacGibbon, Page 495. General Roy's Military Survey of Scotland (1745‚Äì55) marks 'Ravenscraig' as 'Old Corsehill' and also marks the 'new' Corsehill on the other side of the burn, thereby apparently confirming that they both had the same name and one replaced the other, although only 'Old Corsehill' is still in any way visible, just some foundations of 'new' Corsehill being apparent in 2007, the rest of Corsehill House being removed in the 19th century.RCAHMS Retrieved : 2010-11-29 Traces survive of a much silted up ditch that may be the remains of a track which led from the Stewarton to Dunlop road to the castle and then on to the cattle creep that runs under the railway line giving access to the east side where Corsehill House once stood. The fine old sandstone bridge which carried the road up to Corsehill was demolished in the early 1990s. A local tradition was that the iron 'jougs' on it were for imprisoning witches, although it may be that these were linked to the Barony Court functions of the old Corsehill Barony, the records of which still survive and make reference to the stocks.Corsehill Baron-Court BookBrown, George (2006). Oral communication to Griffith, Roger S.Ll. Adamson on his walking tour in 1875 records that Old Corsehill Castle was never very large and that the surviving portion showed signs of recent repair. A great treasure is said to lie buried beneath the founds in a dark chamber and that a local man had once starting digging in search of it when a voice arose from deep under the ground saying \\"Dig no more in ruined Ravenscraig\\".Adamson, p.156 A tunnel or Ley tunnel is said to run from near Old Corsehill Castle down to the Annick Water just up stream of Lainshaw Castle. The tunnel was supposedly crawled through by the grandfather of a local man.Hewitt, Davie (2006). Oral communication to Roger Griffith. This tunnel may be related to the drainage of the nearby, flooded quarry, the Water Plantation area and other Lainshaw estate lands. Templehouse fortalice An area opposite the site of Templehouses was known as 'The Castle'.Milligan, Page 8. and this may reflect the existence of the castle or fortalice here (Hewitt 2006). An old road also crossed the river here and ran up to Robertland Castle and Nether Robertland (Lainshaw 1779). StevenSteven. states that William Dean held the feu for the area of Templehouse, now more commonly called 'Darlington'. The 1860 OS map does record the site of this Templehouse which may have had a small fortalice associated with it. Its precise site was at Darlington on the road to Kingsford before the East Burn. This area continued to be called Templehouses for many years after the buildings stones were removed by local people for building purposes. The Baron-Court book A remarkable and fortuitous survival is the 'Baron-Court book of the Baron-Court of Corshill', having been in the possession of Mr John Brown of Stewarton and published by the Ayr & Wigton Archaeological Association in 1884. The records start in 1666 and ends in 1719.Corshill Baron-Court Book, Pages 65-67 In 1667 Hew Harper was fined and sentenced to be placed in the stocks at the 'Laird's pleasure'.Corshill Baron-Court Book, Pages 77 King's Kitchen An old thatched cottage at the top end of Stewarton, on the road to Glasgow, had the name of \\"King's Kitchen Head\\", more recently called Braehead. It was nearly adjacent to the old baronial residence of Corsehill and was part of that barony. Further along the road is Kingsford and further along still is King's Well and the King's Stable. The story is told of a King who whilst on his progress of administering justice was given hospitality, for some long forgotten reason, at this cottage. The wife of the house begged the King for the life of her husband who was one of those to be tried by the King. The others were hanged, but the King dismissed the husband with the admonition \\"to be a better bairn.\\". Corsehill Castle and King Malcolm Canmore This is a well known local story and one version given by Robert Cunningham in 1740 in his manuscript, entitled the Right Honorable the Earl of Glencairn's family, is that MacBeth murders his cousin, King Duncan I. The king's son, Malcolm Canmore (big head in Gaelic) tries to reach temporary safe refuge in his castle of Corsehill (also Crosshill). MacBeth's men were almost upon Malcolm when he sees a peasant, Friskin (or Friskine), turning hay in a barn (or pasture) nearby. Friskin hides Malcolm who then escapes to England with Friskin as a retainer. King Harthacanute of England and Norway gave them protection. When Harthacanute died his successor King Edward the Confessor gave Malcolm an army which permitted him to conquer Scotland and kill King MacBeth. The grateful King Malcolm III (1031 to 1093) gave Friskine the thanedom or Baillery of Cunninghame and the family took this name, together with the motto of 'Over Fork Over' which they retain to this day.Robertson, Page 303 It is also said that the Cunninghams were 'Masters of the king's horses' and that they took their motto from this position in the 'punning way' which is typical of the armorial bearings and mottos of many an aristocratic family. In another version of the story, it is stated by Frederick van BassenDouglas, Page 289 who was a Norwegian historian, that the saviour of King Malcolm III was actually a Malcolm, son of Friskin, however in other respects the story is the same. This story does not fit with the historical record, however it is of ancient origin and a grain of truth must in some way relate it to real events. A Magbie or MacBeth Hill curiously or coincidentally exists above Stewarton near Old Coreshill Castle. Sir William Montgomery of Giffin acquired these lands, his father being Troilus Montgomery.Reilly  Micro-history The holder of the lands of Cocklebie had the 'right and privilege' of holding a weekly market and four yearly fairs.Search over Lainshaw, Page 252 Andrew Cunninghame was concerned in the murder of David Rizzio. Sir A. Cunningham of Corsehill attended the famous 1839 Eglinton Tournament in what is now Eglinton Country Park and he was allotted a seat in the Grand Stand.Aikman, Page 8. RobertsonRobertson (1820) in 1820 refers to Macbeth Hill (Magbie) as being part of the Corsehill lands. Troilus Montgomery became Laird of MacBeth-hill or Magbie hill in Peeblesshire. Timothy Pont in 1604 - 08 records that so thickly was the district about Stewarton and along the banks of the Irvine populated for a space of three or four miles (6 km) \\"that well travelled men in divers parts of Europe (affirm) that they have seen walled cities not so well or near planted with houses so near each other as they are here, wherethrough it is so populous that, at the ringing of a bell in the night for a few hours, there have seen convene 3000 able men, well-horsed and armed.\\"Robertson, Page 303 In the 1600s Stuartoune had fairs on the first Thursday of January, the first Monday of May, and the last Wednesday of October. A weekly market on Thursdays is recorded as being not well attended. In 1820 only six people were qualified to vote as freeholders in Stewarton Parish, being proprietors of Robertland (Hunter Blair), Kirkhill (Col. J. S. Barns), Kennox (McAlester), Lainshaw (Cunninghame), Lochridge (Stewart) and Corsehill (Montgomery-Cunninghame). The Draffen Stone outside Draffen House (previously Upper Lochridge in Stewarton) The Draffen Stone used to be located in a field near the house of the same name. Due to a housing development it has been moved to a site in front of Draffen House. It is not known whether this stone is merely a 'rubbing stone' for cattle or a menhir. It is not recorded by Historic Scotland. The Lairds of Corsehill were the Deacons Heritable of the Bonnet Court of Corsehill which regulated the activities of the Stewarton bonnet makers. Old Hillhouse quarry and the Water plantation. The first Corsehill Queen is jocularly said to be King Malcolm III second wife, Queen Margaret, niece of Edward the Confessor of England. This Malcolm III, also known as Malcolm Canmore, was also Lord of Corsehill.Kerr She was canonised and St.Margaret's Chapel is the oldest surviving building at Edinburgh Castle, Highlanders however called her the 'Accursed Margaret.'Best In 1797 Magbie Hill above Stewarton has a field called 'Stone Field' which may record a standing stone now long destroyed or possibly moved as the nearby farm has two large boulders in front of it. Coal pits are marked in the vicinity of Magbie (MacBeth) Hill, possibly explaining the name, as 'mag' was a term used for poor quality coal. The nearby 'Water Plantation' was known as 'Magbie-hill Plantation'.Lainshaw Estate map of 1779. Scottish National Archives.

One story says that some teams called a good pitcher \\"their Asa\\" after Brainard, in time shortened to ace. pitcher of the original Cincinnati Red Stockings, the first fully professional baseball team, after having pitched for the Excelsior club of Brooklyn, New York. Early career Born 1841 in Albany, New York, Brainard played outfield and second base for the mighty Excelsiors of Brooklyn in 1860. Led by the sensational teenage fast pitcher, Jim Creighton, the team toured New York state from Albany to Buffalo, a major event in the base ball boom. The Civil War curtailed that; after playing 21 matches in 1860, the Excelsiors played none in 1861 and only a few in 1862. Following Creighton's premature death, Brainard succeeded him as the regular pitcher and remained in that role for four seasons. The Excelsiors played a heavy schedule again in 1866, the first full peacetime season, winning 13 of 20 games--a strong team but no longer a threat to the strongest. Young Candy Cummings, one inventor of the curveball, evidently won the pitcher's job by the end of the season. In 1867 the National club of Washington completed the first western tour, playing ten games from Ohio to Missouri during three weeks in July. Brainard probably joined the team in the fall, in time for a shorter tour from Troy, New York to Philadelphia, where the strongest teams were based.Brainard played 6 games, primarily as pitcher, among 36 Nationals games logged by Wright (2000). Cincinnati At 27 years old, he moved to Cincinnati for the 1868 season where he shared second base and pitcher with manager Harry Wright. Open professionalism was one year away but the long move suggests that Brainard was somehow compensated by club members if not by the club.On the other hand, Wright pitched more than Brainard. (Wright (2000) distinguishes them simply as \\"P,2B\\" and \\"2B,P\\".) Maybe Asa's reputation and bargaining power were at low ebb. Cincinnati fielded a strong team that year, with five of the famous team already in place. When the NABBP permitted professionalism, the Red Stockings hired five incumbents including Brainard and five new men to complete its famous Nine, the first team on salary for a season. In their 1869 campaign, Asa Brainard pitched more than 70% of the innings, Harry Wright more than 25%, as the team toured the continent undefeated, vanquishing all of the plausible challengers. With Charlie Sweasy ensconced at second, the two pitchers now shared center field.Some tandems shared pitcher and right field, a less demanding position. Wright's primary role as team captain probably required that he be in the center of the field. The Red Stockings toured again in 1870, with Brainard pitching almost 70% of the innings in 74 games. Occasionally beaten this year, the team may have been the strongest again, but the club dropped professional base ball in the fall. National Association Harry Wright was hired to organize a new team in Boston, where he signed three teammates for 1871, also bringing along the \\"Red Stockings\\" designation. The other five regulars including Asa Brainard and catcher Doug Allison signed with Nick Young's Washington Olympics, an established club that also joined the new, entirely professional National Association (NA). The five former Red Stockings led the Olympics to a respectable finish in the inaugural NA season. Brainard's published \\"career statistics\\" begin with this year. Later, Brainard played from 1871 to 1874 for the Washington Olympics, Middletown Mansfields, and Baltimore Canaries, all teams in the National Association. Brainard died of pneumonia in Denver, Colorado at age 47, only a few months after John Bass at age 40, the first major league ballplayer to die in that city. Owing to its dry climate and relative convenience, Denver had become a destination for people suffering from tuberculosis.Dead Ball Era He is buried in Green-Wood Cemetery, Brooklyn.

He was also involved in the establishment of Trinity Grammar School in Melbourne where he also became headmaster. He was the father of the historian Gavin Long. Early life and career George Merrick Long was born in Carisbrook, Victoria. He was educated at Maryborough Grammar School. He later matriculated and was awarded the Rupertswood theological studentship to Trinity College at the University of Melbourne, from which he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1899 and a Master of Arts in 1901. Long became a deacon on 28 May 1899 and a priest on 10 June 1900. In 1899 he was posted to the district of Foster in Gippsland. He later returned to Melbourne to become senior curate at Holy Trinity Church, Kew. There he became involved with the foundation of Trinity Grammar School, becoming its headmaster in 1904. Long served on several diocesan committees and was made a canon of St Pauls Cathedral in 1910. In May 1911 he was elected bishop of the Anglican Diocese of Bathurst, and was consecrated on 30 November 1911 at St Andrew's Cathedral in Sydney. For his services, Long was awarded a Lambeth degree of Doctor of Divinity by the Archbishop of Canterbury. First World War Long joined the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) on 16 November 1917 as an Anglican chaplain. He sailed for London in January 1918 and was posted to the Australian Reinforcement Camp in France in April 1918. There he was approached by Major General Brudenell White to head the AIF's education project. Long accepted the post of Director of Education, AIF on 10 May 1918 and was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 1 June 1918. Long established himself in London, and drew up a scheme for professional, general and technical training to be conducted by teaching within the AIF and by sending men out to universities, schools and businesses. Officers with instructional experience were selected and assembled for three weeks training at the University of Cambridge. In three weeks at Cambridge, Kelly produced the books Beef, Mutton and Wool, the first of a series of fifteen texts written by Long's agricultural section. Post war When the war ended on 11 November 1918, Long was forced to put the education scheme into full effect earlier than expected. He was promoted to colonel and then temporary brigadier general on 1 January 1919. In March, with the scheme fully underway, Long's health began to suffer, and in April he handed over control to Brigadier General Walter McNicoll. For his services, Long was awarded honorary Doctor of Letters (LLD) degrees by both the University of Cambridge and the University of Manchester, and was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE). In July 1919, Long returned to his diocese, where he continued his involvement with education. He restarted All Saints College in Bathurst on a new site, and opened the Marsden School for Girls at Kelso. Long was grand chaplain of the United Grand Lodge from 1923 to 1926.

Its name means \\"Mountain of Death\\" or \\"Summit of Death,\\" since in the past crossing the mountains from the Valle Central meant a three- or four-day journey, on foot or on horseback, and many ill-prepared travelers succumbed to the cold and rain. However, the peak is now easily accessible since the highway runs close by. A drivable track from the highway (Kilometer 89) leads to a peak, with its cluster of telecommunications aerials. A short hike is also available from the highway to another peak marked with a barrel. A sign marks the high point of the highway (Costa Rica 2) at 3,335 meters (10,942 feet), from where the vehicle track and hiking trail begin. At this altitude, overnight temperatures can dip below freezing, but the sun soon raises the temperatures in the morning, with a high risk of sunburn in the thin clear air. Record temperatures reach below -6¬∞C. This mountain is in Talamanca range, which extends from eastern Costa Rica into neighbouring western Panama. This range was a volcanic island in the geological past, it raised result of tectonic uplift and its separation from other mountain ranges means that it has developed many endemic species of animals and plants, often with affinities to Andean forms. The higher areas are p√°ramo habitat, with stunted shrubs, dwarf bamboo, and tree ferns, and smaller plants like blueberry, gooseberry and lady's slipper. Below this zone, the natural vegetation is oak forest with bamboo understory, an excellent place to see the charismatic resplendent quetzal.Stiles and Skutch, A guide to the birds of Costa Rica, Nearly 50% of the bird species recorded from Cerro de la Muerte are endemic to the Talamanca range. These include fiery-throated hummingbird, timberline wren, sooty robin, black-billed nightingale-thrush, peg-billed finch and volcano junco.  Crossing Cerro de la Muerte  Because crossing Cerro de la Muerte took up to five days on foot, at the beginning of the twentieth century, three resting stations were created by Congressional Decree Number 45, signed on August 5, 1908. Between 1910 and 1912, the three resting stops, known as houses, were built; \\"Divisi√≥n\\", \\"La Muerte\\" and \\"Ojo de Agua\\", at a cost of ‚Ç°1,749.47. They were built at intervals of about 10 to 12 hours of hiking from each other. There was a rule of leaving firewood ready for the next guest. In 1990, the Ministry of Culture recognized the importance of the resting stop houses, and in November 20, 2016 the \\"Casa Refugio Ojo de Agua\\" was restored and is now a small museum. ¬°A remozar el Monumento de Ojo de Agua!

Administrative division The community of Gardiki comprises two settlements: *Gardiki (population 58, 2011 census) *Palaiochori (population 85, 2011 census) History The village occupies the site of the ancient town of Pellinaeum or Pelinna. The ancient town survived until the early Byzantine period, but disappears thereafter only to reappear under the name of Gardiki in the 11th century. The Byzantine settlement was built on the ruins of the ancient citadel, with the foundations of the ancient wall providing the base of the later medieval fortifications. A ruined three-aisled basilica dedicated to St. Paraskevi from the 14th century also survives. In the late medieval and Ottoman periods, the area was settled by Aromanian (Vlach) Greeks, who remain the main group of the modern village. Episcopal see The town is attested as an episcopal see of the Greek Church since the 11th century as a suffragan see of the Metropolis of Larissa. It was often combined with the nearby see of Peristera (modern Taxiarches).

The refurbished headquarters building in 2007 with the Moonliner II replica installed. The TWA Corporate Headquarters Building, located at 1735 Baltimore Avenue in the Crossroads neighborhood of downtown Kansas City, was Trans World Airlines headquarters until 1964, when the airline moved to New York City. The selection of Kansas City as the headquarters for TWA (Transcontinental Air Transport after it merged with Western Air Express, initially T&WA;) was said to have been made by Charles Lindbergh. The building was designed by architects Raymond E. Bales, Jr. and Morris Schechter and built by the Long Construction Company of Kansas City; site work began in May 1955, and construction was completed on October 31, 1956. The building's exterior was decorated in TWA's signature red and white corporate colors. The three-story L-shaped commercial facility was dominated by aluminum panels and corrugated concrete paneling. It was constructed using the Youtz-Slick construction method, in which steel support beams were first erected and then concrete slabs were poured at ground level and lifted into place by hydraulic jacks; the slabs were then bolted and welded onto the beams, which allowed for a reduction in construction costs and construction time. By 1964 TWA had become a major international figure in aviation, which prompted a move of the airline's executive offices to New York City. The 1735 Baltimore building remained the headquarters for TWA's accounting department, ticket office, credit department, and cargo department until 1969; the airline continued to use the building for training its flight attendants until opening the Breech Academy in nearby suburban Overland Park, KS in 1969. In 2002 the TWA building was added to the National Register of Historic Places. It had been vacant for several years, though plans as late as 2003 called for it to be converted to residential condominiums under the name of TWA Lofts LLC. Instead, in early 2005, the Kansas City-based urban development firm The Nicholson Group hired local architectural firm el dorado inc to design and coordinate the restoration. Following the renovation, it was then leased to the Kansas City- based advertising agency Barkley Inc.; the agency moved into the renovated building on November 14, 2006http://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/news/2015/09/02/barkley-twa- building-lease-extension.html. TWA Moonliner II During TWA's heyday, its headquarters building was easily identified by the TWA Moonliner II rocket that stood on the roof's southwest corner. It was modeled after the original , one-third scale TWA Moonliner at Disneyland's Tomorrowland attraction; TWA was the Moonliner's corporate sponsor until 1962. The Moonliner II was then removed from the building's roof by TWA's new owners, shortly after Howard Hughes sold his controlling interest in the airline. The iconic rocket was then sold to SpaceCraft, a Kansas City, MO travel-trailer company. When SpaceCraft moved to Concordia, MO in 1970, the by then all-white Moonliner II moved with them. There it slowly fell into disrepair for the next 25 years, as it stood on a campground located nearby their travel-trailer manufacturing plant, just south of Interstate 70 between Kansas City and St. Louis. The deteriorated Moonliner replica was then sold to and carefully restored by a longtime Disney collector, until once again sporting its original red and white TWA markings. The restored Moonliner II is now on display at Kansas City's National Airline History Museum located at the Charles B. Wheeler Downtown Airport; at this location, the restored rocket stands about five miles (8 km) from its original TWA roof-top location. The historic restoration of the TWA headquarters building led to the fabrication of a brand new Moonliner II replica begun in March 2006 by the Kansas City office of the Bratton Corporation. The completed replica was installed on September 29 of that year at the same southwest corner roof location as the original.

Missions The Fiji Islands were included in the territory of the old Vicariate Apostolic of Central Oceania, created by Propaganda Fide in 1842. The first Catholic mission in Fiji was founded in 1844, and on 10 March 1863, the territory was erected into a prefecture Apostolic. On 5 May 1887, the vicariate was established and entrusted to the Marist fathers. The first Apostolic vicar was the Right Rev. Julian Vidal, D.D., S.M., titular Bishop of Abydos (consecrated 27 December 1887). Catholic missions soon were established on the islands Viti Levu, Ovalau, Vanua Levu, Tavenui, Kadavu and Rotuma, the official residence of the vicar Apostolic being at Suva on Viti Levu. The statistics for the vicariate showed in the early 20th century, for about 250 islands, of which some 90 are inhabited; its total land area is , while the population in 1911 was 139,541 (3,707 Europeans; 87,096 autochthonous Fijians -of Melanesian (Papuan) stock, much crossed with Polynesian strains-; 4,286 Indians; the remainder of other eastern races): 30 priests (Marist Fathers), tending 18 central stations and 273 villages; 11 Little Brothers of Mary (Marist Brothers), in charge of a boarding and day school at Suva, a seminary and college at Cawaci and an English school for natives at Rewa; 24 European and 31 native Sisters of the Third Order of Mary (with 14 houses; novitiate at Solevu), conducting the majority of schools for girls; 8 sisters of St. Joseph of Cluny (2 houses), conducting the parochial school at Suva; 10 Sisters of the Holy Name of Mary (Marist Sisters), in charge of the school and orphanage at Levuka, a school at Ba, and assist the Marist brothers in the seminary and college at Cawaci; 12 native brothers (novitiate at Loretto) in 4 communities. The English college at Cawaci for the training of catechists and the children of the chiefs had 42 catechists, 80 boys and 12 girls. In the central stations the Marist brothers and sisters taught reading, writing etc., as well as religion, to 500 boys and 450 girls, while in the villages 315 catechists give elementary instruction to about 2000 children. The churches and chapels numbered 65, and the total -minoritarian- Catholic population about 12,000 (300 Europeans). A station for lepers was conducted on Makogai Island by one Marist father and two sisters of the Third Order of Mary. In 1966 it was promoted as Metropolitan Archdiocese of Suva, which has three suffragans on other island states: Rarotonga (Cook Islands), Tarawa (Kiribati) and Nauru (both last-named states are independent).

The Micral N was the first commercially available microprocessor-based computer. In 1986, three judges at The Computer Museum, Boston ‚Äì Apple II designer and Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Wozniak, early MITS employee and PC World publisher David Bunnell, and the museum's associate director and curator Oliver Strimpel ‚Äì awarded the title of \\"first personal computer using a microprocessor\\" to the 1973 Micral. The Micral N was the earliest commercial, non-kit personal computer based on a microprocessor (in this case, the Intel 8008). The Computer History Museum currently says that the Micral is one of the earliest commercial, non-kit personal computers. The 1971 Kenbak-1, invented before the first microprocessor, is considered to be the world's first \\"personal computer\\".

Lacombe was responsible for the memory system, I/O high speed channel, power supply and front panel. Gernelle invented the Micral N, which was much smaller than existing minicomputers. The January 1974 Users Manual called it \\"the first of a new generation of mini-computer whose principal feature is its very low cost,\\" and said, \\"MICRAL's principal use is in process control. It does not aim to be an universal mini-computer.\\"Micral N Users Manual, p. 66, 76. January 1974. bitsavers.org. The computer was to be delivered in December 1972, and Gernelle, Lacombe, Benchetrit and Beckmann had to work in a cellar in Ch√¢tenay-Malabry for 18 hours a day in order to deliver the computer in time. The software, the ROM-based MIC 01 monitor and the ASMIC 01 assembler, was written on an Intertechnique Multi-8 minicomputer using a cross assembler. The computer was based on an Intel 8008 microprocessor clocked at 500 kHz. It had a backplane bus, called the Pluribus with 74-pin connector. 14 boards could be plugged in a Pluribus. With two Pluribus, the Micral N could support up to 24 boards. The computer used MOS memory instead of core memory. The Micral N could support parallel and serial input/output. It had 8 levels of interrupt and a stack. The computer was programmed with punched tape, and used a teleprinter or modem for I/O. The front panel console was optional, offering customers the option of designing their own console to match a particular application. It was delivered to the INRA in January 1973, and commercialized in February 1973 for FF 8,500 (about $1,750) making it a cost-effective replacement for minicomputers which augured the era of the PC. France had produced the first microcomputer. A year would pass before the first North American microcomputer, SCELBI, was advertised in the March 1974 issue of QST, an amateur radio magazine.Allan, Roy A. (2005). \\"What was the First Personal Computer?\\", A Bibliography of the Personal Computer, . eBook on archive.org Indeed, INRA was originally planning to use PDP-8 computers for process control, but the Micral N could do the same for a fifth of the cost. An 8-inch floppy disk reader was added to the Micral in December 1973, following a command of the Commissariat √† l'Energie Atomique. This was made possible by the pile-canal, a buffer that could accept one megabyte per second. In 1974, a keyboard and screen were fitted to the Micral computers. A hard disk (first made by CAELUS then by Diablo) became available in 1975. In 1979, the Micral 8031 D was equipped with a 5\\" 1/4 inches hard disk of 5 Megabytes made by Shugart.  Later models  Following the April 1974 introduction of the Intel 8080, R2E introduced the second and third Micral models, 8080-based at 1 MHz, the Micral G and Micral S. In November 1975, R2E signed Warner & Swasey Company as the exclusive manufacturer and marketer of the Micral line in the United States and Canada. Warner & Swasey marketed its Micral-based system for industrial data processing applications such as engineering data analysis, accounting and inventory control.R2E Finds U.S. Associate, Computerworld, Nov 5, 1975 R2E and Warner & Swasey displayed the Micral M multiple microcomputer system at the June 1976 National Computer Conference. The Micral M consists of up to eight Micral S microcomputers, each with its own local memory and sharing the common memory so the local and common memory look like one monolithic memory for each processor.

The Portal was based on an Intel 8085 processor, 8-bit, clocked at 2 MHz. It weighed 12Kg and its dimensions were 45cm x 45cm x 15cm, It provided total mobility. Its operating system was Prologue. Later Micrals used the Intel 8088. The last Micral designed by Fran√ßois Gernelle was the 9020.Birth of the Modern Personal Computer: Micral N of Fran√ßois Gernelle Retrieved 2012-02-03. In 1981, R2E was bought by Groupe Bull. Starting with the Bull Micral 30, which could use both Prologue and MS-DOS, Groupe Bull transformed the Micral computers into a line of PC compatibles. Fran√ßois Gernelle left Bull in 1983.  Legacy  Truong's R2E sold about 90,000 units of the Micral that were mostly used in vertical applications such as highway toll booths and process control. Litigation followed after Truong started claiming that he alone invented the first personal computer. The courts did not judge in favor of Truong, who was declared \\"the businessman, but not the inventor\\", giving in 1998 the sole claim as inventor of the first personal computer to Gernelle and the R2E engineering team. In the mid-1970s, Philippe Kahn was a programmer for the Micral. Kahn later headed Borland which released Turbo Pascal and Sidekick in 1983. Paul G. Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft with Bill Gates, bought a Micral N by the auctioneer Rouillac at the Artigny Castle in France, on June 11, 2017 for his Seattle museum Living Computers: Museum + Labs.

For example, in a 0-1 integer program, all constraints are of the form :x_i\\\\in\\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}. The relaxation of the original integer program instead uses a collection of linear constraints :0 \\\\le x_i \\\\le 1. The resulting relaxation is a linear program, hence the name. This relaxation technique transforms an NP-hard optimization problem (integer programming) into a related problem that is solvable in polynomial time (linear programming); the solution to the relaxed linear program can be used to gain information about the solution to the original integer program. Example Consider the set cover problem, the linear programming relaxation of which was first considered by . In this problem, one is given as input a family of sets F = {S0, S1, ...}; the task is to find a subfamily, with as few sets as possible, having the same union as F. To formulate this as a 0-1 integer program, form an indicator variable xi for each set Si, that takes the value 1 when Si belongs to the chosen subfamily and 0 when it does not. Then a valid cover can be described by an assignment of values to the indicator variables satisfying the constraints :\\\\textstyle x_i\\\\in\\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\} (that is, only the specified indicator variable values are allowed) and, for each element ej of the union of F, :\\\\textstyle \\\\sum_{\\\\\\\\{i\\\\mid e_j\\\\in S_i\\\\\\\\}} x_i \\\\ge 1 (that is, each element is covered). The minimum set cover corresponds to the assignment of indicator variables satisfying these constraints and minimizing the linear objective function :\\\\textstyle \\\\min \\\\sum_i x_i. The linear programming relaxation of the set cover problem describes a fractional cover in which the input sets are assigned weights such that the total weight of the sets containing each element is at least one and the total weight of all sets is minimized. As a specific example of the set cover problem, consider the instance F = {{a, b}, {b, c}, {a, c}}. There are three optimal set covers, each of which includes two of the three given sets. Thus, the optimal value of the objective function of the corresponding 0-1 integer program is 2, the number of sets in the optimal covers. However, there is a fractional solution in which each set is assigned the weight 1/2, and for which the total value of the objective function is 3/2. Thus, in this example, the linear programming relaxation has a value differing from that of the unrelaxed 0-1 integer program. Solution quality of relaxed and original programs The linear programming relaxation of an integer program may be solved using any standard linear programming technique. If the optimal solution to the linear program happens to have all variables either 0 or 1, it will also be an optimal solution to the original integer program. However, this is generally not true, except for some special cases (e.g., problems with totally unimodular matrix specifications.) In all cases, though, the solution quality of the linear program is at least as good as that of the integer program, because any integer program solution would also be a valid linear program solution. That is, in a maximization problem, the relaxed program has a value greater than or equal to that of the original program, while in a minimization problem such as the set cover problem the relaxed program has a value smaller than or equal to that of the original program. Thus, the relaxation provides an optimistic bound on the integer program's solution. In the example instance of the set cover problem described above, in which the relaxation has an optimal solution value of 3/2, we can deduce that the optimal solution value of the unrelaxed integer program is at least as large. Since the set cover problem has solution values that are integers (the numbers of sets chosen in the subfamily), the optimal solution quality must be at least as large as the next larger integer, 2. Thus, in this instance, despite having a different value from the unrelaxed problem, the linear programming relaxation gives us a tight lower bound on the solution quality of the original problem. Approximation and integrality gap Linear programming relaxation is a standard technique for designing approximation algorithms for hard optimization problems. In this application, an important concept is the integrality gap, the maximum ratio between the solution quality of the integer program and of its relaxation. In an instance of a minimization problem, if the real minimum (the minimum of the integer problem) is M_{int}, and the relaxed minimum (the minimum of the linear programming relaxation) is M_{frac}, then the integrality gap of that instance is IG=\\\\frac{M_{int}}{M_{frac}}. In a maximization problem the fraction is reversed. The integrality gap is always at least 1. In the example above, the instance F = {{a, b}, {b, c}, {a, c}} shows an integrality gap of 4/3. Typically, the integrality gap translates into the approximation ratio of an approximation algorithm. This is because an approximation algorithm relies on some rounding strategy that finds, for every relaxed solution of size M_{frac}, an integer solution of size at most RR\\\\cdot M_{frac} (where RR is the rounding ratio). If there is an instance with integrality gap IG, then every rounding strategy will return, on that instance, a rounded solution of size at least M_{int} = IG\\\\cdot M_{frac}. Therefore necessarily RR \\\\geq IG. The rounding ratio RR is only an upper bound on the approximation ratio, so in theory the actual approximation ratio may be lower than IG, but this may be hard to prove. In practice, a large IG usually implies that the approximation ratio in the linear programming relaxation might be bad, and it may be better to look for other approximation schemes for that problem. For the set cover problem, Lov√°sz proved that the integrality gap for an instance with n elements is Hn, the nth harmonic number. One can turn the linear programming relaxation for this problem into an approximate solution of the original unrelaxed set cover instance via the technique of randomized rounding . Given a fractional cover, in which each set Si has weight wi, choose randomly the value of each 0-1 indicator variable xi to be 1 with probability wi √ó(ln n +1), and 0 otherwise. Then any element ej has probability less than 1/(e√ón) of remaining uncovered, so with constant probability all elements are covered. The cover generated by this technique has total size, with high probability, (1+o(1))(ln n)W, where W is the total weight of the fractional solution. Thus, this technique leads to a randomized approximation algorithm that finds a set cover within a logarithmic factor of the optimum. As showed, both the random part of this algorithm and the need to construct an explicit solution to the linear programming relaxation may be eliminated using the method of conditional probabilities, leading to a deterministic greedy algorithm for set cover, known already to Lov√°sz, that repeatedly selects the set that covers the largest possible number of remaining uncovered elements. This greedy algorithm approximates the set cover to within the same Hn factor that Lov√°sz proved as the integrality gap for set cover. There are strong complexity- theoretic reasons for believing that no polynomial time approximation algorithm can achieve a significantly better approximation ratio . Similar randomized rounding techniques, and derandomized approximation algorithms, may be used in conjunction with linear programming relaxation to develop approximation algorithms for many other problems, as described by Raghavan, Tompson, and Young. Branch and bound for exact solutions As well as its uses in approximation, linear programming plays an important role in branch and bound algorithms for computing the true optimum solution to hard optimization problems. If some variables in the optimal solution have fractional values, we may start a branch and bound type process, in which we recursively solve subproblems in which some of the fractional variables have their values fixed to either zero or one. In each step of an algorithm of this type, we consider a subproblem of the original 0-1 integer program in which some of the variables have values assigned to them, either 0 or 1, and the remaining variables are still free to take on either value. In subproblem i, let Vi denote the set of remaining variables. The process begins by considering a subproblem in which no variable values have been assigned, and in which V0 is the whole set of variables of the original problem. Then, for each subproblem i, it performs the following steps. # Compute the optimal solution to the linear programming relaxation of the current subproblem. That is, for each variable xj in Vi, we replace the constraint that xj be 0 or 1 by the relaxed constraint that it be in the interval [0,1]; however, variables that have already been assigned values are not relaxed. # If the current subproblem's relaxed solution is worse than the best integer solution found so far, backtrack from this branch of the recursive search. # If the relaxed solution has all variables set to 0 or 1, test it against the best integer solution found so far and keep whichever of the two solutions is best. # Otherwise, let xj be any variable that is set to a fractional value in the relaxed solution. Form two subproblems, one in which xj is set to 0 and the other in which xj is set to 1; in both subproblems, the existing assignments of values to some of the variables are still used, so the set of remaining variables becomes Vi \\\\ {xj}. Recursively search both subproblems. Although it is difficult to prove theoretical bounds on the performance of algorithms of this type, they can be very effective in practice. Cutting plane method Two 0-1 integer programs that are equivalent, in that they have the same objective function and the same set of feasible solutions, may have quite different linear programming relaxations: a linear programming relaxation can be viewed geometrically, as a convex polytope that includes all feasible solutions and excludes all other 0-1 vectors, and infinitely many different polytopes have this property. Ideally, one would like to use as a relaxation the convex hull of the feasible solutions; linear programming on this polytope would automatically yield the correct solution to the original integer program. However, in general, this polytope will have exponentially many facets and be difficult to construct. Typical relaxations, such as the relaxation of the set cover problem discussed earlier, form a polytope that strictly contains the convex hull and has vertices other than the 0-1 vectors that solve the unrelaxed problem. The cutting-plane method for solving 0-1 integer programs, first introduced for the traveling salesman problem by and generalized to other integer programs by , takes advantage of this multiplicity of possible relaxations by finding a sequence of relaxations that more tightly constrain the solution space until eventually an integer solution is obtained. This method starts from any relaxation of the given program, and finds an optimal solution using a linear programming solver. If the solution assigns integer values to all variables, it is also the optimal solution to the unrelaxed problem. Otherwise, an additional linear constraint (a cutting plane or cut) is found that separates the resulting fractional solution from the convex hull of the integer solutions, and the method repeats on this new more tightly constrained problem. Problem-specific methods are needed to find the cuts used by this method. It is especially desirable to find cutting planes that form facets of the convex hull of the integer solutions, as these planes are the ones that most tightly constrain the solution space; there always exists a cutting plane of this type that separates any fractional solution from the integer solutions. Much research has been performed on methods for finding these facets for different types of combinatorial optimization problems, under the framework of polyhedral combinatorics . The related branch and cut method combines the cutting plane and branch and bound methods. In any subproblem, it runs the cutting plane method until no more cutting planes can be found, and then branches on one of the remaining fractional variables.

Written by Rob Grant and Doug Naylor, and directed by Ed Bye. The script was written as a late addition to the series following an electricians' strike at the BBC. The episode follows on from the cliffhanger set by \\"Confidence and Paranoia\\"‚Äîthere are now two Rimmers on board Red Dwarf. The episode was remastered, along with the rest of the first three series, in 1998, to bring it up to a standard suitable for international broadcast. Plot Arnold Rimmer (Chris Barrie) is delighted to have a double of himself after Dave Lister (Craig Charles) activated his hologram disc, believing it would allow him to see his old girlfriend. The pair promptly move out and begin spending time with each other, the Rimmers both moving into new sleeping quarters and encouraging each other through their routines of study, exercise, sleep. Lister decides to make the most of it by enjoying his own sleeping quarters to himself and viewing a video left by Rimmer, detailing his death. Choosing to skip his lengthy monologue, he views the moment when Rimmer was being chastised by Captain Hollister (Mac McDonald) for his repair of the drive plate before the crew's death in the radiation surge. Lister soon becomes confused over Rimmer's dying words, \\"Gazpacho soup!\\", and decides to find out why he said them. The Rimmers soon find themselves competing against each other, causing their tempers to fray and an argument to break out between the two.Howarth & Lyons (1993) p. 51. Lister learns that each has determined that the other must go, and the original Rimmer lost out as a result. As Rimmer arrives in full uniform, including his medals for his long years of service on Red Dwarf, to prepare for erasure, Lister asks him about his final words before his death. Rimmer soon explains he was once invited to the Captain's Table for dinner, and was served Gazpacho soup for starters. Because he didn't realise that it was meant to be served cold, Rimmer was humiliated by everyone when he ordered the chef take it away and bring it back hot, and thus was never invited to the Table again. Rimmer remarks that it was the worst moment in his life and prepares for his erasure, only for Lister to explain that he opted to erase the double just to hear his explanation. Rimmer, annoyed at being tricked, demands him to tell no one, to which Lister agrees before teasing him. Production When Red Dwarf first went into the studios at BBC Manchester, \\"Me¬≤\\" didn't exist. It was originally planned to end the series with \\"Confidence and Paranoia\\", but after the BBC electrician strike disrupted the production. This gave the writers, Grant and Naylor, a chance to write a different finale to the series. They discarded the then- second episode \\"Bodysnatcher\\", about Rimmer stealing body parts from Lister to build a new body for himself, and wrote \\"Me¬≤\\".Red Dwarf Series 1 guide: Episode six: Me¬≤, Red Dwarf Smegazine, volume 2, issue 6, October 1993, Fleetway Editions Ltd, The plot of \\"Me¬≤\\" is partly based on \\"Bodysnatcher\\", which featured Lister not getting along with his own hologram‚ÄîGrant and Naylor took this basic concept and centred it around Rimmer instead. The two Rimmer scenes were shot using a split screen process, meaning that Chris Barrie would do a take on one half of the screen and then go over to the other half and do another take. The takes would be spliced together in the editing process. Rimmer's embarrassing and reputation-damaging incident with gazpacho soup is based on a real incident that was only narrowly avoided by writers Rob Grant and Doug Naylor. At a meeting at Thames Television, the pair were bewildered when they received cold soup, but refrained from saying anything. Afterwards, they discovered that gazpacho soup is meant to be served cold, and they had avoided the embarrassment that the fictional Rimmer would later suffer. Although Mac McDonald returned to play Captain Hollister, his scene was filmed at the same time as his appearances in the first episode; \\"The End\\". Additionally, the line \\"What a guy!\\" used by Rimmer 1 when spoken to Rimmer 2 was re-used in later series by other characters in reaction to the actions of Rimmer's parallel-universe alter-ego Ace Rimmer. Cultural references Rimmer's last gasp of \\"Gazpacho Soup\\" as the snow globe falls over *Orson Welles' film Citizen Kane is referenced both directly and indirectly during this episode. Lister tells Rimmer that he and Cat are going to be watching Citizen Kane at the ship's cinema. The more subtle references appear in Rimmer's death scene, where a snow globe drops off the Captain's desk next to his hand, thus mirroring Kane's death in the film, and utters his cryptic last words \\"gazpacho soup\\" which hold importance in the episode. Kane's last word, \\"Rosebud\\", was the theme of the film. *'My Diary, by Arnold J. Rimmer' was Rimmer's journal of his thoughts and deeds. He had hoped it would someday be placed alongside his historic heroes' own work; 'Napoleon's War Diaries' and 'The Memories of Julius Caesar'. *To elaborate on an April fool's joke, Holly wears a Groucho Marx comedy glasses-nose-and-moustache. Reception The episode was originally broadcast on the British television channel BBC2 on 21 March 1988 in the 9:00 p.m. time slot. Both co-creators/writers, Grant and Naylor, consider \\"Me¬≤\\" as one of the successes of the first series. Grant stating that it is one of his favourite shows and the idea of how you would react if you met yourself was an intriguing story. Despite coming 25th in a Red Dwarf Smegazine readers poll, with 0.9% of the votes, the episode was considered one of the better efforts from the first series.Readers survey results, Red Dwarf Smegazine, p. 27., issue 10, December 1992, Fleetway Editions Ltd, Remastering The remastering of Series I to III was carried out during the late 1990s. Changes throughout the series included replacement of the opening credits, giving the picture a colour grade and filmising, computer-generated special effects of the Red Dwarf spaceship and many more visual and audio enhancements. Changes specific to \\"Me¬≤\\" include new music and sound effects over Rimmer's tribute video, fireball corridor shot added to flashback of cadmium explosion, new explosion and sound effects added to scene, shots of Lister smoking tightened or removed to keep in line with current TV standards and Rimmer 2 calling Rimmer 1 a \\"great nancy\\" was removed.

History  The whole of Oceania had at first been entrusted by the Roman Congregation for the missions, Propaganda Fide, to the Society of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary (1825); but the territory proving too large, the western portion was afterwards formed into an Apostolic vicariate and given to the Society of Mary (1836), Jean Baptiste Pompallier being appointed first ordinary of the Apostolic Vicariate of Western Oceania. In 1842, the Propaganda Fide created an Apostolic Vicariate of Central Oceania, including New Caledonia, Tonga, Samoa and Fiji Islands. On 23 July 1847, it lost territory to establish the Apostolic Vicariate of New Caledonia, on 20 August 1850 again to the newly established Apostolic Vicariate of Archipelago of the Navigators and 27 March 1863 to the newly established Apostolic Prefecture of Fiji Island. After these subdivisions, the vicariate included only the Tonga, the Wallis Islands, Futuna and Niu√©. The Tonga Islands extend from 15¬∞ to 22¬∞ S. lat. and from 173¬∞ to 176¬∞ W. long. Niu√© is three hundred miles to the east. The Wallis Islands lie in 13¬∞ S. lat. and 178¬∞ W. long.; Futuna, in 40¬∞ 14' S. lat. and 179¬∞ 33' W. long. These archipelagos were divided among several more or less constitutional monarchies; the Kingdoms of Tonga, Niu√©, Wallis and the two Kingdoms of Futuna. Tonga and Niu√© were under British protectorate, Wallis and Futuna, under French. By the early 20th century, freedom of worship was theoretically recognized everywhere except in Niu√©, which was exclusively Protestant; Wallis and Futuna were entirely Catholic. In Tonga, there were Catholics, Methodists belonging to the Sydney conference, independent Methodists forming a national Church, some Anglicans, Adventists and Mormons. The total population was 34,000, with 9200 Catholics. In the early 20th century, there were 35 Catholic churches; 21 European and 1 native Marist priests, and 3 native secular priests; 28 schools with 2039 children; 2 colleges; 1 seminary. The establishments for girls were under the care of 52 Sisters of the Third Order of Mary. The boys' schools were conducted by native lay teachers; the colleges and the seminary by priests. The islands were divided into districts, with resident missionaries assembling every month for an ecclesiastical conference. There were annual retreats for the priests, for the sisters and for the catechists, besides general retreats for the faithful about every two years. In each village there was a sodality of men (Kan Apositolo) and another of women (Fakafeao). The yearly number of baptisms averaged 310; of marriages, 105. The vicariate has given to the Church the proto-martyr of Oceania, Blessed P. Chanel.  Legacy  After having lost more territory to establish the Apostolic Vicariate of Wallis and Futuna on 1935.11.11, by now being reduced to a tiny part of its original expanse, it was on 13 April renamed as Apostolic Vicariate of Tonga Islands, on 22 March 1957 again renamed as Apostolic Vicariate of Tonga Islands and Niue, which would on 21 June 1966 be promoted as Roman Catholic Diocese of Tonga, yet remains exempt, i.e. directly subject to the Holy See.

A large number of anchor placements, especially if they form a zig-zag rather than a straight line, can make the rope drag so bad that the climber can hardly move forward. Let‚Äôs assume a situation where the rope runs through several carabiners which are not all aligned. By using the equations of Euler-Eytelwein to describe the dry friction between the rope and the protection points, the rope drag can be calculated.Ulrich Leuth√§usser (2011):Retrieved January 16, 2011 It can be expressed by an effective mass of the rope that the climber has to pull, which is always larger than the rope mass itself. This effective mass depends exponentially on the sum of the angles of the direction changes the climber has made. ‚ÄúEarly errors‚Äù by not using longer runners to reduce the angles at the first protection points are less severe than ‚Äúlater errors‚Äù, which is plausible when considering that the higher friction points are pre-loaded with more weight from the rope itself. The chances of rope drag occurring can be reduced by using two ropes in parallel instead of just one (so that for each point of protection, the nearer rope can be used), using carabiners with integral pulleys (such as the DMM Revolver), or by using slings to extend protection so that the rope can stay in a straight line. If drag still happens, then the climber may need (if possible) to stop and set up a belay point sooner than expected. Rope drag on a dynamic climbing rope also effectively reduces the length of rope available for absorbing fall energy (or, in other words, effectively increases the rope's modulus of elasticity), resulting in higher fall impacts than would be expected using a simple fall factor calculation.

Niolam Island) is the largest island in the Lihir group of islands, 22 km long and 14.5 km wide, in Papua New Guinea's New Ireland Province. It consists of a complex of several overlapping basaltic stratovolcanoes rising 700 m above sea level. While the volcanoes are not currently active, geothermal activity is still present. The island is in what was the forearc basin associated with the subduction of the Pacific Plate beneath the North Bismarck Plate. Subduction stopped about 10 million years ago with the collision of the Ontong Java plateau with the subduction zone. The island is located NE of Port Moresby. Annual rainfall averages ; temperature ranges between 19 and 35 degrees Celsius. The population of the Lihir Group increased from 12,570 in 2000(PNG Census 2000) to an estimated 18,000 in 2007. Residents are of Melanesian descent and have predominantly a subsistence lifestyle. Lihirians follow traditional belief systems, although official census records indicate that 99% of the PNG population are Christians, with Catholicism being the largest denomination. Most villages are located on the coastal fringe, although it is thought that originally some villages were located inland but were moved to the coast at the encouragement of missionaries. The economic focal point of the island is the Ladolam Gold Mine.Muller D., Groves D.I. (2016) Potassic igneous rocks and associated gold- copper mineralization (4th ed.). Mineral Resource Reviews. Springer-Verlag Heidelberg, 311 pp Ladolam represents one of the largest epithermal gold deposits in the world and it is hosted by high-potassic igneous rocks. The mine is operated by Newcrest Mining Limited. The mine holds one of the world's largest gold resources (46 million ounces). Grab samples from the submarine Conical Seamount, located about 8 km south of Lihir Island, contain high gold concentrations of up to 230 g/t Au (avg. 26 g/t, n=40) that are hosted by high-potassic trachybasalts. The mine is located on a geothermically active area and to enable the mine to proceed, steam relief wells have been drilled to release subterranean pressure. The steam has, in part, been captured and is used to operate a 50 MW geothermal power station which generates approximately 25% of the mine's power requirements. Mine tailings are discharged into the sea. The largest settlement on the Island is Londolovit, where most of the expatriate mine employees live. Basic shopping and health care facilities are located there. The local hospital has inpatient and outpatient facilities and provides health care services to both the expatriate and local communities. An airstrip large enough to land a small jet is also located north of Londolovit, at Kunaye village As is the case in many tropical regions, mosquito-borne viruses are present on the island, as is malaria. Land ownership follows traditional models with land being owned by clans. Insofar as it relates to land ownership, the society is matrilineal with land being passed through the female generations. The land cannot be sold; however, usage rights can be granted. The Island has two largest Primary Schools and a Secondary School Located on the Mining impacted area. The largest of the two Primary schools is Sekunkun Primary School which is on the North Eastern part of the Island. The school has total of over 600 students and 19 teachers.

She was originally a violinist who chose to become a violist when she wanted to study with William Primrose, whose technique and ease in playing the viola she greatly admired. Her coordination technique is often considered to be an analysis of Primrose's technique. She was a frequent participant at the Marlboro Music Festival in Vermont. In 1955, she was invited by Pablo Casals to perform chamber music with him at the Pablo Casals Festival in Prades, where she returned for at least seven subsequent festivals. She made her Carnegie Hall recital debut in February 1960. Her recital was reviewed by Harold Schonberg, a leading reviewer for the New York Times. He wrote, \\"About as large an audience as Carnegie Recital Hall has ever held jammed it yesterday evening at 5:30 to hear Karen Tuttle's recital. The violist, with Artur Balsam at the piano, gave a concert that seemed to be attended by every string player in town.\\". She was a member of the Galimir, Gotham, and Schneider Quartets, as well as the American String Trio. In 1994 she was recognized by ASTA with the Artist Teacher Award. Curtis Institute of Music awarded her an honorary doctorate in 2005. She taught at the Peabody Conservatory of Music, Curtis Institute of Music, Mannes College and at Juilliard, and several of her students now teach at prominent universities and music conservatories: Christine Rutledge, Sheila Browne, Caroline Coade, Susan Dubois, Edward Gazouleas, Jeffrey Irvine, Kim Kashkashian, Michelle LaCourse, Katherine Murdock, Ashan Pillai, Lawrence Power, Lynne Ramsey, Andr√© Roy, Karen Ritscher, Carol Rodland, Kate Hamilton, Masumi Per Rostad, Jennifer Stumm, and Stephen Wyrczynski.

It is located within the municipality of Vang, Innlandet, in the southernmost part of the Jotunheimen mountain area. It is situated on the northern shore of lake Bygdin on the western side of the Svartdalen Valley and is the southernmost and most prominent summit on a rather long ridge containing twelve more 2000 m peaks. The summit can be observed from most of the mountain areas south of Jotunheimen. The three Torfinnstindene summits seen from Kalveh√∏gde.The mountain consists of three summits, named √òstre, Midtre and Vestre Torfinnstind (Eastern, Middle and Western). The name probably derives from the Norwegian male name Torfinn, but some sources claim that the name derives from the local name of a type of grass and has during the last 100 years been transformed into Torfinn, which is close to the name of the grass, Turfing. The name is also found in the valley due west of the summits, the small glacier covering parts of the extremely steep north wall, the sharp ridge pointing northwards from the Western summit and the tourist lodge situated on lake Bygdin south of the mountain. The Eastern summit was reached for the first time in 1876 by Emmanuel Mohn, William Cecil Slingsby and Knut Lykken. The two first being mountaineers from Christiania and Great Britain, and the third the local expert. In 1894 the middle summit was climbed by, Andreas Saxegaard, Therese Bertheau, Antonette Kamstrup and Tostein R√∏ine, the last one being the local expert. The western summit, which is the easiest to climb, was visited for the first time in 1912 by Rolv √òdegaard The summits are the southernmost 2000 m peaks in Norway, but one, and is made of the extremely hard gabbro rock. The gabbro in Torfinnstindene is partly of the normal \\"gray-with-black-specs\\" variety, but parts of the eastern summit are of a red variety. The view from the summits, particularly the Eastern, is one of the best in southern Norway. On a clear day, you can see almost as far as Oslo. The Eastern and Western summits can be reached after a rather strenuous hike, but the Middle summit can only be climbed - normally as part of a traverse of all the summits. The following is a brief description of the trip. The first part of the hike follows the grass- and flower-covered slope on the southeast flank of the Eastern summit. A number of ravines, dug out by meltwater from the Ice Age on, leads towards the summit. Only one of them leads all the way to the eastern shoulder of the summit. This is a steep climb, but with good weather conditions no equipment is needed. The vertical western wall of Eastern Torfinnstind towards the steep wall of Middle Torfinnstind. From the eastern summit, a long rappel is needed to reach the very steep and narrow pass between the two summits. The climb to the middle summit needs no equipment. From the middle summit three rappels are needed to get all the way down to the even more steep and narrow pass between the two last summits. The climb up the lowest, western summit, is quite easy, but many would prefer to use a rope on a short part of the climb. From the western summit, a sharp edge leads down to the long ridge turning northwards towards lake Gjende. The rest of the descent is long talus slopes. The climb of the eastern summit has gained popularity in the last years of increased peak bagging in Norway, and guided tours are arranged. The traverse is also popular, but the number who completes it is much lower than the number of visitors on the eastern summit. The western, easiest and lowest summit is visited rather rarely except by those traversing.

From 1921 to 1925 Pratella headed the Bologna-based music publication Il Pensiero Musicale.Nicoletta Betta, Il Pensiero Musicale, ripm.org An early project drawn from Pratella's interest in indigenous folksong was the opera La Sina d'Vargu√µn (1909), which attracted the attention of Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, the father of Italian futurism. Pratella joined the futurist group in 1910 and became one of its most ardent activists, publishing three tracts which were combined into the pamphlet Musica Futurista in 1912. Inspired by Pratella, Luigi Russolo created his Intonarumori (Noise Intoners) in 1913 and wrote his own manifesto, The Art of Noises (1913), introducing the futurist concept of introducing noise into music. Pratella was less than enthusiastic about the use of Intonarumori, but he agreed to utilize their resources in his opera L'aviatore Dro (1911‚Äì1914) which was written in close collaboration with Marinetti. At the end of World War I, Pratella broke with the futurists; L'aviatore Dro opened in 1920 and proved popular with critics and audiences alike, but its impracticality and odd storyline doomed it to certain obscurity. In his later years, Pratella occasionally turned his attention to composing for films, notably in Mother Earth (1931) and L'argine (1938). He also worked on a proposed Raccolta nazionale delle musiche italiane (National Collection of Italian Music) with Gabriele D'Annunzio, but the project was interrupted by the poet's death.La biografia di Pratella Francesco B., Wuz.it Manifesti Cover of the 1912 edition of Musica futurista by Francesco Balilla Pratella ‚Äì cover art by Umberto Boccioni According to Pratella, Italian music was inferior to music abroad. He praised the \\"sublime genius\\" of Wagner and saw some value in the work of Richard Strauss, Debussy, Elgar, Mussorgsky, Glazunov and Sibelius. By contrast, the Italian symphony was dominated by opera in an \\"absurd and anti- musical form\\". The conservatories encouraged backwardness and mediocrity. The publishers perpetuated mediocrity and the domination of music by the \\"rickety and vulgar\\" operas of Puccini and Umberto Giordano. The only Italian Pratella could praise was his teacher Mascagni, because he had rebelled against the publishers and attempted innovation in opera, but even Mascagni was too traditional for Pratella's tastes. In the face of this mediocrity and conservatism, Pratella unfurled \\"the red flag of Futurism, calling to its flaming symbol such young composers as have hearts to love and fight, minds to conceive, and brows free of cowardice\\". He did so via several short manifestos, a key example of which was Musica futurista (Manifesto of Futurist Musicians), published in 1910. The main ideas of his musical manifestos were: *for the young to keep away from conservatories and to study independently; *the founding of a musical review, to be independent of academics and critics; *abstention from any competition that was not completely open; *liberation from the past and from \\"well-made\\" music; *for the domination of singers to end, so that they became like any other member of the orchestra; *for opera composers to write their own librettos, which were to be in free verse; *to end all period settings, ballads, \\"nauseating Neapolitan songs and sacred music\\"; and *to promote new work in preference to old. Style and influence The Italian futurist music manifestos, particularly Russolo's, have long been an inspiration to avant-garde musicians and continue to be so in the twenty- first century. However, mid-twentieth century scholars‚Äîamong a small fraternity who had access to Pratella's long-forgotten compositions‚Äîwere deeply critical of Pratella owing to a perceived streak of conservativism in his own music which, they felt, undermined the revolutionary spirit of his manifesti. As Benjamin Thorn put it, \\"[Pratella]'s compositions never quite lived up to the rhethoric.\\"Benjamin Thorn, \\"Francesco Ballila Pratella\\" in Larry Sitsky, \\"Music of the Twentieth-Century Avant-Garde: A Biocritical Sourcebook.\\" Greenwood Press, Westport, CT 2002 In Italy, however, Pratella's fortunes have been improving. Pianist Daniele Lombardi has recorded some of Pratella's futurist piano music, and in 1996 the La Scala opera house in Milan revived L'aviatore Dro for the first time in 75 years. The success of this production and other factors have helped to revitalize Pratella's futurist profile in his home country. Although he composed seven operas, Pratella was not a particularly prolific composer. In addition to his futurist works, operas and folk choruses, he left a small but respectable output of chamber music, piano music, sacred music and songs. Pratella' s cycle of symphonic poems based on the folk music of Romagna are well respected in Italy, and place Pratella among Italy's \\"Generation of 1880,\\" composers such as Ottorino Respighi, Gian Francesco Malipiero and Ildebrando Pizzetti who eschewed opera in favor of instrumental music.

This 'stretch' is what makes it 'dynamic', in contrast to a static rope that has very low elongation under load. Greater stretch allows a dynamic rope to absorb the energy of a sudden load such as from a fall more slowly, reducing the peak force and therefore the chance of catastrophic failure. Kernmantle ropes are the most common type of dynamic rope, and nylon has replaced all natural materials such as hemp (Manila rope) since 1945 for durability and strength. Rope types  Dynamic climbing ropes are classified into three categories: Single ropes, twin ropes, and half ropes (also referred to as 'double ropes'). *Single ropes are designed to be used alone, and are by far the most common, and used for top-roping, sport climbing, and trad climbing. *Twin and half ropes are used for lead climbing, and are designed to be used as a pair - they are not strong enough to be safely used on just a single strand, and they are tested to different standards as a single rope. **Twin ropes are used by treating the pair of ropes as a single rope, clipping both ropes through the same carabiner at each piece of protection. **Half ropes are also used as a pair, but only one rope is clipped through each piece of protection- the climber alternates which rope is clipped through each piece. On wandering routes where protection is placed far apart on either side, half ropes can significantly reduce rope drag. Both twin and half ropes have the advantage of redundancy, as well as allowing a rappel along the full length of the climbing rope (by tying both ropes together), so that climbers can descend from a long multipitch route with fewer rappels than with a single rope. Some ropes are 'triple rated', meeting the standards for all three rope types, so they can be used in each configuration.  Length and diameters  Dynamic ropes used for rock climbing come in a variety of lengths and diameters, with the most common lengths being , , . Lengths will vary depending on rope maintenance and age, and there are even ropes as long as 80 meters for specialized ascents on routes that would normally require a multi- pitch climbing attempt due to being only slightly longer than a standard rope length. Rope diameters are generally between 8.3mm and 11.5mm, with the different diameters used for slightly different purposes. Sport and multi- pitch trad climbers often value thinner ropes because they are lighter, and have less rope drag. Thinner ropes also run more smoothly through belay devices, especially assisted braking devices or 'tube-style' devices operated in 'guide mode', which can be tedious to pull thicker or stiffer rope through. Lighter, thinner ropes, however, have less strength than a thicker rope and will sustain fewer hard falls. Note that some belay devices are better suited for different rope diameters. This is particularly relevant with assisted braking devices, such as the Petzl Grigri (which, for example, works best with a 9.4-10.3 mm thick linehttps://www.petzl.com/US/en/Sport/Belay-devices-- descenders/GRIGRI-2) or the Faders SUM. Users must make sure to read the instructions for the device carefully to ensure safety and recognize any limitations to rope diameter.  Standards and testing  All modern rock climbing dynamic ropes rated by the UIAA must meet certain standards and pass testing for Construction, Sheath Slippage, Static Elongation, Impact Force on first fall, and Number of falls held.Sterling Rope Guide to Rope Engineering, Design, and Use The force rating indicates the maximum amount of force the rope can deliver to a falling climber, measured in kilonewtons (kN), under test conditions designed to simulate a hard fall; typical climbing ropes range from 9kN up to an Arborist's 24kN. The force rating is often misunderstood by climbers, because all other climbing gear is rated by the breaking strength (in kN) of the material. Whereas a higher rating (indicating greater strength) is desired for other gear, for dynamic ropes a lower rating is generally desired, as this indicates it would give a 'soft catch' that is less likely to injure the climber or break or dislodge protection or anchors.Alpine Exposures FAQ- Climbing Ropes explained Unlike most climbing equipment, dynamic ropes do not have a rated tensile breaking strength. Instead, the strength of a rope is tested by the number of standard test falls a rope can sustain before breaking. The test falls use an 80 kg weight for single ropes (55 kg for half ropes), and a fall factor of 1.7 (4 meter fall on 2.3 meters of rope). This tests simulates a very hard fall that would rarely occur. When climbing, it is possible to produce a fall factor as high as 2, however, real-world climbing situations include additional shock absorbing elements which are not included in the test standard, such as the body of both the climber and belayer, elasticity of their harnesses and anchor materials, and friction between the rope and the belay device, and any protection pieces.Mammut: Standards for dynamic ropes Single ropes must sustain at least 5 such falls before breaking, and a rope that can sustain more than 9 falls is considered a 'multifall' rope. In practice, climbing ropes rarely if ever break due to a fall alone- all documented rope failures involve the rope being cut or damaged, for example by abrasion against a sharp rock edge. Ropes are especially vulnerable to being cut while they are weighted with the body of the climber, and moving over a sharp edge (for example if a following climber is resting his weight on the rope, or using the rope for assistance, while swinging or traversing under a roof, while being belayed from above). In general, thicker ropes will be stronger and more durable, and have a higher fall rating.  Rope care and maintenance  Modern ropes are made from nylon and don't require a great deal of maintenance. Ropes that are frequently used are often inspected for cuts, abrasions, or frayed areas; any cut or fraying that passes into the core of the rope is cause for concern. Ropes can also be washed to clean them of any extensive dirt or grime. Every fall lessens the amount of impact a rope can later absorb, and hard falls can seriously compromise the strength of a rope, without showing obvious signs of wear. One definition of a 'hard fall' is a long fall (> 10‚Äì15 meters) with a fall factor greater than one. Manufacturers often recommended that ropes be retired if they sustain an extremely hard fall, even if they do not show outward signs of wear.Mammut Rope Care Manual See also * Climbing equipment * Fall factor References ;Notes ;Sources *Spelean.com.au Caving equipment Climbing equipment Mountaineering equipment Ropes ","title":"Dynamic rope"},{"id":"6368584","text":"Constantine Hangerli (, Konstantinos Chatzeris; c. 1760 ‚Äì 18 February 1799), also written as Constantin Hangerliu, was a Prince of Wallachia, then part of the Ottoman Empire, between 1797 and the time of his death. He was the brother of Alexander Hangerli, who served as Prince of Moldavia in 1807. Biography=Early life and investiture A Phanariote, Hangerli claimed heritage from the Byzantine family of the Palaiologos.M√©zi√®re He was married to Doamna Roxana, who survived his death.Caragea, p. 85 According to one account, the surname Hangerli () had been assigned to one of his ancestors by Sultan Mehmed IV, after allegedly saving his life by curing him of a potentially fatal illness. The name was based on the word , which was indicative of closeness to the Sultan's person. The Hangerlis were related to other high-ranking Greek families, including the Ypsilantis and the Mourousis.Caragea, p. 84 After serving as Dragoman of the Fleet, Constantine surprised foreign diplomats through his appointment to the throne in Bucharest, in competition with the much more prestigious Alexander Ypsilantis.Official correspondence, in Djuvara, pp. 44‚Äì45 He probably owed this rise to the influence of his friend and former associate, Kapudan Pasha Husein K√º√ß√ºk: the latter had been dispatched to quell the rebellion of Osman Pazvantoƒülu in Rumelia, and requested that Wallachia be made secure through the investiture of a trustworthy prince.Caragea, pp. 83‚Äì84 Hangerli reached Bucharest on 4 January 1798, breaking with local custom by entering the city area through Podul Mogo≈üoaiei, instead of Calea ≈ûerban VodƒÉ. Bucharesters believed this to be a bad omen, indicative of an \\"unwise rule\\". Like all Phanariotes, he stopped at VƒÉcƒÉre≈üti Monastery to prepare for the official inauguration.Ionescu, p. 244 For unknown reasons, he stayed in there more than a month, before temporarily settling in the Saint Sava Monastery, where he remained until Curtea NouƒÉ was completely repaired. \\"Hangerli's winter\\" and conflicts with Husein K√º√ß√ºk Hangerli increased taxes to a very high level; new fees were created, including a special one for widowers. These measures were prompted by the substantial demands of the Porte, who was faced with Pazvantoƒülu's major military successes, as well as by the prince's wish to increase his own revenue. The taxation reached its peak with the re-introduction of the despised vƒÉcƒÉrit tax (per head of cattle owned), which had been dismissed for perpetuity by his predecessor, Constantine Mavrocordatos ‚Äì Hangerli purchased the lifting of a curse on the latter (cast in 1763) from Gregory V, Patriarch of Constantinople.Caragea, p. 84; Djuvara, pp. 72, 148 Despite this, the tax continued to face stiff opposition from the part of Orthodox clergy and Metropolitan Dosiftei Filiti. The boyars also refused to sign the decree, and Hangerli had to bribe four of them (among them Nicolae Br√¢ncoveanu and Cornescu) in order to agree to countersign it;Caragea, p. 84; Ionescu, pp. 247‚Äì248 so as to avoid a rebellion against Hangerli, all the boyars were subsequently exempt from this new tax.Ionescu, pp. 247‚Äì248 The early months of 1798, during which princely envoys raided the country while peasants attempted to hide their livestock, became known as \\"Hangerli's winter\\". Results of the inventory showed an abundance of cattle, but the population lacked access to currency. As a result, Hangerli enforced extortion through torture (it is probable that several peasants were killed in an attempt to collect their entire possessions ‚Äì \\"if they pay, no one will get killed\\" was supposedly a reply uttered by Hangerli himself).Caragea, p. 84; Djuvara, pp. 72‚Äì73; Giurescu, p. 107 The ensuing war between the Ottomans and Pazvantoƒülu brought several defeats for the former, prompting Husein K√º√ß√ºk to take refuge in Bucharest. Fearing the anger of Selim III, he attempted to throw the blame on Hangerli for not having raised enough funds. Catching news of this, the prince tried to intrigue against K√º√ß√ºk, but was disfavored after a coalition of his political adversaries began campaigning against him.Caragea, pp. 84‚Äì85; Djuvara, p. 335 According to the chronicler Dionisie Eclesiarhul, Hangerli attempted to buy back K√º√ß√ºk's protection by having him attend a banquet during which prostitutes, disguised and introduced as members of the most powerful boyar families, competed for the pasha's attention.Caragea, p. 84; Dionisie, in Djuvara, p. 17, in Giurescu, p. 107 Execution On 11 February 1799, the sultan issued a firman to execute Hangerli on the spot, and a kapucu was dispatched to Bucharest, accompanied by an executioner (whom Dionisie described as \\"a frightening Moor\\").Dionisie, in Djuvara, p. 18 The pair made efforts to travel in secrecy, and, upon their arrival, spent three days in seclusion at the Beilic Inn. Dismissing the warning of his postelnic (according to a contemporary account), Hangerli, after being read the firman, was attacked by the two as he was attempting to call his guards: he was strangled by the Moor, shot twice in the chest and stabbed once by the kapucu, and finally decapitated.Caragea, p. 85; Dionisie, in Djuvara, p. 19; Giurescu, p. 107 The guards, who stormed in after hearing the shots, were shown the firman, and could no longer intervene.Dionisie, in Djuvara, p. 19 The kapucu displayed Hangerli's head for all witnesses to see, stating: \\"Here is the dog that ate away the sultan's rayah\\". He then presented it to Roxana, with the words: \\"Here is the head of your husband\\". Hangerli's remains were exposed in the palace's courtyard for a few days; a passer-by aimed a para at the severed head, and was recorded saying: \\"Here, gorge on money\\" (SaturƒÉ-te de bani). The prince was ultimately buried in the Bucharest church of St Spyridon the New.

Its name comes from the Greek drys for oak: Latreille named the type genus Dryinus because the first species was collected in an oak plant in Spain. The larvae are parasitoids of the nymphs and adults of Auchenorrhyncha. Dryinidae comprises approximately 1900 described species, distributed in 17 subfamilies and 53 genera. Description The adult wasp can measure from 0.9 to 5.0 mm in length and in some cases can reach 13 mm. The body of the adult wasp has a 'waist' where it is constricted in the middle. The rear legs have spurs which may be used for grooming. The antennae have 10 segments. Many species have a marked sexual dimorphism, where males are totally different from the females in the size and shape of the body. Males have wings while females are often wingless and resemble worker ants. The ovipositor is retractable and not visible when retracted. Life history The female dryinid injects an egg into the host insect with her ovipositor. Females may also have front legs modified with a pinching apparatus which they use to restrain the hosts for their larvae during oviposition. The larvae are legless or have only vestigial legs. The larva feeds on the internal structures of the host, and as it grows larger it begins to protrude from the body. It develops a hardened sac (called a \\"thylacium\\") around its body for protection. The host is eventually killed and the larva leaves the dead body and spins a cocoon.Dryinidae.

She is one of Eastwood Collegiate Institute's notable alumni. Biography Charity Brown began singing with local bands while still in high school in Kitchener, Ontario in the late 60s. She performed and recorded under the name Phyllis Brown until 1973. Around 1970 she became the lead vocalist for Rain, a popular Kitchener-based rock band. Rain scored a #22 hit in Canada in 1971 with \\"Out of My Mind\\", written by Greg Hambleton and released on Axe Records. She left Rain in 1973 to focus on her solo career. Her Motown-flavoured brand of white soul was produced by Harry Hinde and was strong enough to secure her a contract with A&M; Records. It was at this time she changed her stage name to Charity Brown. Her two original studio albums with A&M; produced four top ten hits in Canada, including the #5 hit \\"Take Me in Your Arms (Rock Me a Little While)\\". \\"Take Me in Your Arms\\" was a Holland-Dozier-Holland composition that had been an R&B; hit for Kim Weston in 1965 and the Isley Brothers in 1968. Charity Brown released her single in mid April, 1975 about a week before the Doobie Brothers released the same song in the US. The Doobie Brothers version peaked at #11 in the US but was overshadowed in Canada by Brown's release. The Doobie Brothers peaked at number 30 in Canada only after Brown's version began to leave the charts. During the 1980s, Brown performed as a voice artist for Atkinson Film-Arts TV specials and programmes including The Velveteen Rabbit, Rumpelstiltskin, Dennis the Menace and The Adventures of Teddy Ruxpin. She also made a guest appearance on The Alan Thicke Show and appeared with a number of top Canadian female recording artists on the CBC Television special Anne Murray's Ladies Night in 1979. After a twenty-year hiatus from music, she began performing again in southern Ontario, including a performance at the 2007 Kitchener Blues Festival. She released an album of material recorded in 1979 but never before released. She also released a sampler called Wings of Time, featuring two original tracks. A new full album was promised, but has not yet been released. Awards Charity Brown was nominated for the Most Promising Female Vocalist award at the 1975 Juno Awards, the top music award in Canada. She was nominated again in 1976, 1977 and 1978 for Best Female Vocalist.

FC N√ºrnberg in the Bundesliga. Club career=Early days Iliƒçeviƒá was born in Aschaffenburg, West Germany to Bosnian Croat parents. His father emigrated to West Germany from a small village near Od≈æak, Bosnia and Herzegovina, then part of the SFR Yugoslavia). He began his career in the youth ranks of Viktoria Aschaffenburg, before joining Regionalliga S√ºd side Darmstadt 98 in January 2005. At the club, he quickly became a first-team regular under former Bundesliga star Bruno Labbadia and scored eight goals in 44 league matches. As a youth-team player, he played as a forward, but later became mainly deployed as an attacking midfielder. VfL Bochum In the summer of 2006, Iliƒçeviƒá joined Bundesliga side VfL Bochum and made his top- flight debut in the club's opening match of the 2006‚Äì07 league season, a 2‚Äì1 defeat at Mainz 05 on 12 August 2006. On 24 September 2006, he scored his first Bundesliga goal, netting the match-winning goal in a 2‚Äì1 win at home to Arminia Bielefeld. He made a total of 19 Bundesliga appearances in his first season with Bochum, scoring two goals. In January 2008, he was loaned to Greuther F√ºrth of the 2. Bundesliga, after making just six Bundesliga appearances (without scoring a goal) with Bochum in the first half of the 2007‚Äì08 league season. He went on to spend a season and a half with Greuther F√ºrth, scoring 4 goals in 38 league appearances. 1. FC Kaiserslautern In the summer of 2009, Bochum loaned Iliƒçeviƒá to another 2.

He made his debut for Hamburg in a match against SC Freiburg coming in as a substitute in 66th minute. He scored his first goal only seven minutes later by scoring a winning goal for Hamburg.

Its population is included within Southill civil parish. Geography Stanford lies north-east of Shefford, south-west of Biggleswade and south-west of Cambridge. Landscape The village lies within the Bedfordshire and Cambridgeshire Claylands (NCA 88) as designated by Natural England. Central Bedfordshire Council has locally classified the landscape as Upper Ivel Clay Valley. Flat, open arable fields predominate. Elevation The village is above sea level. Geology, soil type and land use The village is surrounded by arable farmland and lies on glacial gravel (till) over Lower Greensand. The soil is highly fertile, freely draining and slightly acid but base-rich. Stanford Wood, a pine wood with a small lake is to the east of the hamlet between Stanford Road and the B658. A gravel pit is shown here on the Ordnance Survey map of 1900. A playing field in the middle of the village includes a playground area, basketball court and football pitch. Broom South sand and gravel quarry lies to the north-east. The night sky and light pollution Light pollution is the level of radiance (night lights) shining up into the night sky. The Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) divides the level of night sky brightness into 9 bands with band 1 being the darkest i.e. with the lowest level of light pollution and band 9 the brightest and most polluted. Stanford has a index of 0.5-1 nanoWatts (nW) which places it in band 3. However, the night sky brightens towards Langford, Clifton and Shefford. History Stanford means \\"stone ford\\". The Domesday Book records eight land holdings in Stanford in 1086 and lists thirteen villagers, three smallholders and four slaves. A water mill at the end of Mill Road was fed by a mill race from the Ivel Navigation but by 1916 it was no longer in operation. A small school was opened in 1899 but a falling role led to its closure in 1921 and pupils transferred to Broom. The building on the junction of Old School Lane and the B658 road is now a residential dwelling . Stanford at one time had three public houses. Only the Green Man remains. Governance Stanford elects three councillors to Southill parish council. It is part of Northill ward for elections to the Central Bedfordshire Unitary Authority. Prior to 1894, Stanford was administered as part of the hundred of Wixamtree. From 1894 until 1974 it was in Biggleswade Rural District and from 1974 to 2009 in Mid Bedfordshire District. Stanford is in the Mid Bedfordshire parliamentary constituency and the elected member is Nadine Dorries of the Conservative Party. Public transport Grant Palmer operates route 200 a two-hourly Monday to Saturday daytime bus service to Biggleswade (journey time 9 to 15 minutes) and to Clifton, Shefford and Flitwick (50 minutes). There is a weekly, Wednesday only service to Bedford by community bus operator, Wanderbus (journey time 26 minutes). Wanderbus also runs monthly services to St Neots and Welwyn Garden City.

His code name was 'Champagne'.Ex-Undercover Agent Charged as a Link in Rabin Killing, The New York Times, April 26, 1999 Biography Avishai Raviv studied at Tel Aviv University, which expelled him for violent behavior, and later at Bar Ilan University.Reinfeld, Moshe Haaretz, Jerusalem, Apr.01, 2003. Retrieved March 24, 2013. Raviv was filmed at a public demonstration with a poster of Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin in an SS uniform prior to Rabin's murder. Raviv allegedly knew of Yigal Amir's plans to assassinate Rabin based on a controversial classification of handing over \\"Jewish land\\" as qualifying for \\"din rodef\\" (\\"law of the pursuer\\"). According to Jewish law, a rodef (literally pursuer) is one who is pursuing another person in order to murder them, and may be killed by a bystander in order to stop the murder from occurring if the pursuer does not desist after being warned. According to Rabbi Arthur Waskow, Yigal Amir's interpretation of din rodef is a gross distortion of Jewish law and tradition. \\"First of all, the law of the pursuer only applies to a spontaneous act, whereas Yigal Amir planned this assassination for two years. Secondly, the law of the pursuer is only intended to save a potential victim from imminent death. There is absolutely no proof that withdrawing from certain territories will directly lead to the death of any Jews. On the contrary, Prime Minister Rabin, over half the members of the Knesset, and over half the population of Israel believe exactly the opposite ‚Äì that it will save Jewish lives. Lastly, this law does not refer to elected representatives, for if Yitzhak Rabin was really a pursuer, then so are all his followers and that would mean that Amir should have killed over half the population of Israel! In other words, even according to the law of the pursuer, this act was totally futile and senseless since the peace process will continue.\\"\\"Rabbinic response: Jewish Law on the Killing of Yitzhak Rabin\\", by Rabbi Arthur Waskow, The Shalom Center, 11/14/2005 After Rabin was assassinated, the journalist Amnon Abramowitch revealed that Raviv was an agent of the Shabak. Raviv was brought to trial in 2000 for not preventing Rabin's assassination. Raviv mounted a successful defense on the grounds that he had just been doing his job and events had spun out of control.

In a career almost entirely associated to Valencia ‚Äì which he helped to two La Liga titles ‚Äì and Celta, he scored 89 goals as a professional in 361 games. Club career Born in Aldaia, Valencian Community, S√°nchez started playing professionally for Valencia CF, and his first La Liga appearance was on 25 October 1992 in a 0‚Äì3 loss at FC Barcelona. In the season's closing stages he scored his first goal(s) for the Che, having come on as a late substitute in a 2‚Äì0 home win over RCD Espa√±ol. After a successful loan stint in the second division with RCD Mallorca, S√°nchez left for RC Celta de Vigo, becoming an important attacking element in the Galicians' domestic and European consolidation. In his last two seasons combined, as they finished respectively sixth and fifth, he netted 22 times, eventually returning to his first club. During the second campaign of his second spell, S√°nchez scored 12 league goals (notably back-to-back braces against CD Numancia (3‚Äì0) and UD Las Palmas (5‚Äì1)), adding a further two in the UEFA Champions League semi-final second leg against Leeds United (one with his hand, for a 3‚Äì0 home win), subsequently being replaced in the final loss against FC Bayern Munich. Subsequently, after having appeared in 25 games in Valencia's 2001‚Äì02 league conquest, S√°nchez's importance lessened dramatically in his final season (where he played in only ten matches for the champions, no complete ones). He retired aged 34 after a second spell at Celta, which he helped achieve a return to the top level. Afterwards, S√°nchez became Valencia's sporting director, succeeding Miguel √Ångel Ruiz and leaving the post in August 2008. In June 2009 he moved to R.E. Mouscron from Belgium in the same capacity, rejoining former Valencia teammates Amedeo Carboni and Miroslav ƒêukiƒá (the latter being signed as head coach).

It was the first film she directed and wrote. The film stars David Strathairn, Agnes Bruckner, Margaret Colin, and Frances Fisher. Plot Megan is a teenage gifted writer living in the Dayton, Ohio area. She has been abandoned by her father and neglected by her mother, who works 12-hour days and goes to school at night, leaving Megan to babysit her younger sister, Lily. The girls' father does not pay child support, causing financial strain in the household. Lily has serious emotional problems; she cuts herself, refuses to eat, and speaks about becoming an angel. After being checked into the psychiatric ward of a hospital, Lily kills herself by jumping out of an open window as she tries to \\"fly\\". Meg finds solace in her English teacher, Mr. Auster, who claims he is passionate about writing a novel. He becomes a comfort to Megan, and encourages her to enter a poetry contest, which is later followed by one-on-one poetry tutoring. After winning the local round of the competition, Megan wants to compete at the finals in Florida during spring break. With her mother unable and unwilling to fund the trip, Megan resorts to stealing and is barely able to make it to Florida. A closer, pseudo-sexual relationship develops between Megan and Mr. Auster. The two run into each other outside the hotel that is hosting the poetry competition and go to a hotel room, where Megan reluctantly has sex with Mr. Auster, who stops after realizing that she is not comfortable with the situation. After this, Megan realizes that Mr. Auster has not written a novel at all, and that it was all just a ruse to impress her. After writing and delivering a brand new poem subtly denouncing Mr. Auster, Megan walks out of the competition. Later, back home, she decides to live with her father, riding away with him in his blue car.

MULTOS is an open standard whose development is overseen by the MULTOS Consortium ‚Äì a body composed of companies which have an interest in the development of the OS and includes smart card and silicon manufacturers, payment card schemes, chip data preparation, card management and personalization system providers, and smart card solution providers. There are more than 30 leading companies involved in the consortium. One of the key differences of MULTOS with respect to other types of smart card OS, is that it implements a patented public key cryptography-based mechanism by which the manufacture, issuance and dynamic updates of MULTOS smartcards in the field is entirely under an issuer's control using digital certificates rather than symmetric key sharing. This control is enabled through the use of a Key Management Authority (KMA), a special kind of certification authority. The KMA provides card issuers with cryptographic information required to bind the card to the issuer, initialize the card for use, and generate permission certificates for the loading and deleting of applications under the control of the issuer. Application providers can retrieve and verify the public key certificate of an individual issuer's card, and encrypt their proprietary application code and confidential personalisation data using that card's unique public key. This payload is digitally signed using the private key of the application provider. The KMA, on request from the card issuer, signs the application provider's public key and application code has and creates a digital certificate (the Application Load Certificate) that authorises the application to be loaded to an issuer's card or group of cards. Applications are therefore protected for integrity and confidentiality and loaded to a card without any party sharing symmetric keys and therefore needing to trust any other party sharing the card platform ‚Äì including the card issuer. Both the Application Provider and Card Issuer know that only specific, authorised applications from authorised parties can be loaded to any specific card. Hundreds of millions of MULTOS smart cards have been issued by banks and governments all around the world, for projects ranging from contactless payment, Internet authentication and loyalty, to national identity with digital signature, ePassport with biometrics, health care and military base and network access control. Technical overview A MULTOS implementation provides an operating system upon which resides a virtual machine. The virtual machine provides: * Application run-time environment. * Memory management. * Application loading and deleting. Run- time environment The run-time environment operates within the application space. This consists of code space and data space. The code, developed in the C language and compiled into MULTOS bytecodes is interpreted every time it is executed. The virtual machine performs code validity and memory access checks during execution of the code. The data space is divided into static and dynamic portions. Static memory is persistent and transaction protection ensures the integrity of application's stored data. The key component of dynamic memory is the last in, first out (LIFO) stack as this makes using the various functions much easier. A MULTOS chip is a stack machine, which makes use of this dynamic memory to pass parameters and perform calculations. In addition, the Input/output buffer resides in another dynamic memory segment. Memory management Each application resides with a rigorously enforced application memory space, which consists of the application code and data segments. This means that an application has full access rights to its own code and data, but can not directly access that of another application. If an application attempts to access an area outside its space, it results in an abnormal end to process Application loading and deleting A MULTOS card permits the loading and deleting of applications at any point in the card's active life cycle. A load can take place once the application and its corresponding certificate are transmitted to the chip. A delete is permitted if a certificate that corresponds to a loaded application is transmitted to the chip.

It was situated south-west of Bridlington, East Riding of Yorkshire. History RAF Carnaby opened in March 1944 under the control of No. 4 Group Royal Air Force. Unlike most RAF airfields, there was a single runway, five times the width of a standard runway and long, lying approximately east-west to enable bombers crossing the coast an easier landing. Two similar airfields were either constructed or further developed along the east coast of England, at Manston and Woodbridge, all three providing an emergency option for wartime bomber crews. The three airfields were developed to the same pattern, Woodbridge being the first to open in November 1943. The runway at Manston was brought into operation in April 1944. Along with RAF Manston and RAF Woodbridge, Carnaby was developed as an east coast emergency landing ground for bomber crews. These airfields were intended for use by returning bombers suffering from low-fuel and/or suspected damage to their pneumatic (wheel brake) and/or hydraulic (undercarriage) systems. All three airfields were equipped with one runway, long and wide. There was a further clear area of at each end of the runway. At each of the three airfields, the runway was divided into three lanes. The northern and central lanes were allocated by flying control, while the southern lane was the emergency lane on which any aircraft could land without first making contact with the airfield. Over 1,400 bombers made an emergency landing at Carnaby by the end of the war. Air chief marshal Basil Embry in Mission Completed believed that the three emergency runways were constructed as a result of the success of the -long landing strip and flarepath at Wittering in accepting over 70 damaged aircraft from Bomber Command. The runway had been lengthened in 1940 to reduce landing accidents to Bristol Beaufighter night fighters returning at night and in bad weather. Fog Investigation and Dispersal Operation Carnaby was one of fifteen airfields operating the fog dispersal system known as Fog Investigation and Dispersal Operation (FIDO). The system consisted of two rows of pipes emitting burning petrol one on each side of the runway, the heat from this fire raised the air temperature above the runways, cutting a hole in the fog and provided crews with a brightly lit strip indicating the position of the runway. Post Second World War The station closed in 1946 but was re-activated in 1953 due to the need to train pilots for the Korean War. The airfield was used as a Relief Landing Ground for No. 203 Squadron (then based at RAF Driffield) but closure to flying came soon after in 1954. RAF Carnaby was a PGM-17 Thor missile base from 1959 to 1963 controlled by No. 150 Squadron RAF. Post-RAF history The runway at the former RAF Carnaby, south of Bridlington in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England. Formerly an emergency landing base for RAF Bomber Command, with an unusually long and wide runway for damaged bombers returning from Europe in the Second World War. RAF Carnaby was for many years used for the storage of new Lada cars and a parts distribution centre. The runway and other paved areas were also used to hold motorcycle racing events throughout the 1970s and 1980s, some of which were televised. Today it has been developed beyond recognition into Carnaby Industrial Estate although with aerial photography you can still make out the outline of the former airfield.

During the post- war years until retirement in 1977, Kipawo saw service as a small passenger and vehicle ferry from Bell Island to Portugal Cove, ending 51 years of service, approximately 45 of those as a ferry and currently the second-longest continuous service as a ferry in Canada (SS Prince Edward Island having operated from 1915-1969). Following retirement from ferry service in Newfoundland,Kipawo saw service as a private tour boat in the waters off Terra Nova National Park for several years. While en route to St. John's one day in the late 1970s, she sought shelter in Bonavista Bay from a storm but ran aground and remained there deteriorating for several years. Theater use The vessel was purchased in 1981 by the Kipawo Heritage Society of Wolfville and was returned to Minas Basin in 1982. Contrary to the title of this article, the ferry was built of steel. Not long after returning to the Minas Basin, Kipawo was purchased by the Town of Parrsboro, Nova Scotia for a museum and was deliberately beached in a tidal inlet immediately south of the town while funding arrangements were secured. By 1986 the museum concept was shelved in favour of housing a local theatre, the Ship's Company Theatre, which began to use the Kipawo as their performance centre. In 2004, the theatre company expanded its facilities with an expanded performance hall which architecturally incorporates the Kipawo into the outdoor lobby.

The extras are well done and informative, in some ways doing a much better job than the documentary of presenting facts about the series to a novice, who doesn't know a Companion from an Operative.\\" Judge Adam Arseneau of DVD Verdict describes it as \\"the ultimate expression of fanboy love\\" and explains that the film is more about the fan community than a documentary about Firefly itself. He warns \\"this one is for fans only. Even then, it's a bit obsessive at times.\\" but as a fan himself he enjoyed it.

An unfinished building is a building (or other architectural structure, as a bridge, a road or a tower) where construction work was abandoned or on-hold at some stage or only exists as a design. It may also refer to buildings that are currently being built, particularly those that have been delayed or at which construction work progresses extremely slowly. Many construction or engineering projects have remained unfinished at various stages of development. The work may be finished as a blueprint or whiteprint and never be realised, or be abandoned during construction.

Had it been completed on schedule, it would have been the tallest hotel in the world at the time. There are numerous unfinished buildings that remain partially constructed in countries around the world, some of which can be used in their incomplete state but with others remaining as a mere shell. Some projects are intentionally left with an unfinished appearance, particularly the follies of the late 16th to 18th century. Some buildings are in a cycle of near-perpetual construction, with work lasting for decades or even centuries. Antoni Gaud√≠'s Sagrada Fam√≠lia in Barcelona, Spain, has been under construction for around 120 years, having started in the 1880s. Work was delayed by the Spanish Civil War, during which the original models and parts of the building itself were destroyed. Today, even with portions of the basilica incomplete, it is still the most popular tourist destination in Barcelona with 1.5 million visitors every year.

Many projects do not get to the construction phase, halted during or after planning. Ludwig II of Bavaria commissioned several designs for Castle Falkenstein, with the fourth plan being vastly different from that of the first. The first two designs were turned down, one because of costs and one because the design displeased Ludwig, and the third designer withdrew from the project. The fourth and final plan was completed and some infrastructure was prepared for the site but Ludwig died before construction work began.Yan, Mark.

Sir Christopher Wren, most famous for his role in rebuilding several churches after the Great Fire of London in 1666, sketched a proposed replacement for part of the palace but financial constraints prevented construction. Even without being constructed, many architectural designs and ideas have had a lasting influence.

In 2005, this shooting was reclassified as a terrorist attack. Incident In the attack, Baz shot at a van in which 15 Chabad-Lubavitch Orthodox Jewish students were crossing the Brooklyn Bridge. He used a Cobray MAC-11 fully automatic pistol to strafe the van, and a Glock 17 9mm semi-automatic pistol to shoot at students. He also had a 12-gauge Armsel Striker shotgun in his trunk. Four students were shot. The two most seriously wounded included Ari Halberstam, a sixteen-year-old, who died four days later from a shot to the head. The other student, Israeli-born Nachum Sasonkin, was also shot in the head and suffered permanent major speech impediments. Amir Abudaif, an auto mechanic, reported the incident to the police. During the arrest, Baz was also found to be in possession of anti-Jewish literature, a .380-caliber semiautomatic pistol, a stun gun, a bulletproof vest, and two 50-round ammunition magazines. Initially, Baz claimed a traffic dispute led him to commit the shootings, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation initially classified the case as road rage. Witnesses testified that on the day of the shooting Baz had attended \\"a raging anti-Semitic sermon\\" by Imam Reda Shata at the Islamic Society of Bay Ridge. Baz pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. His defense team also offered the theory that Baz was reacting to events in the Middle East. The jury rejected both defenses, and Baz was convicted of second degree murder and 14 additional counts of attempted murder in New York Supreme Court on December 1, 1994. He was sentenced to 141 years to life in prison. Dead and wounded=Dead Ari Halberstam, a yeshiva student, was killed in the attack. He was the son of Devorah Halberstam and David Halberstam, members of distinguished families associated with the Chabad-Lubavitch movement. He was raised under the personal supervision of the seventh Lubavitcher Rebbe, Menachem Mendel Schneerson. The Halberstam family had ties to the Rebbe as Ari's father worked as a butler and personal manager to the Rebbe. The Halberstam family also includes a rabbinic dynasty of its own, Bobov, whose first Rebbe was Shlomo Halberstam. On March 1, 1994, Ari Halberstam was visiting the ailing Rebbe at the Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital, and was returning to his Brooklyn home via the Brooklyn Bridge. On the entrance ramp to the bridge, gunman Rashid Baz opened fire on the van, which also carried more than a dozen other Hasidic students. Baz was equipped with a submachine gun, two 9mm guns, and a \\"street sweeper\\" shotgun. Baz pursued the van across the bridge as he fired in three separate bursts, spraying both sides of the van, before disappearing into traffic. During the shooting spree, the gunman reportedly shouted in Arabic \\"Kill the Jews,\\" expressing revenge for the terrorist massacre of 29 Muslim worshipers at the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron by Baruch Goldstein four days prior. The attack critically wounded two of the young men and injured two others. Halberstam was rushed to St. Vincent's Hospital and was the most severely wounded, having been shot in the head by Baz. As a result of the massive brain injuries, Halberstam was pronounced dead five days after the shooting. As the funeral procession took place on Eastern Parkway, outside the central Lubavitcher synagogue at 770 Eastern Parkway, some 10,000 mourners and more than 250 police officers took part in the event, to maintain safety. Halberstam was buried in the Montefiore Cemetery in Queens. Wounded Nachum Sossonkin survived but suffered permanent brain damage. Levi Wilhelm survived a bullet to the abdomen. Yaakov Schapiro has minor injuries to one hand and a minor gunshot wound to the head. Legacy Among the items named in memory of Ari Halberstam include: * Ari Halberstam Memorial Ramp on the Brooklyn Bridge, on which the act of terrorism occurred. Only the ramps heading toward the Brooklyn Bridge were named‚Äîthe ramps heading away from the bridge have yet to be named. * Ari Halberstam Memorial Fund. The fund organizes fund raising campaigns to distribute funds to various causes. Ari's fund helps give educational scholarships to underprivileged students and works closely with other community organizations in their fund raising efforts. * The Ari Halberstam Sportsmanship Award, Ari's life and ability in sports are honored annually by Barry Panzer, who coaches the basketball league at Kingsway Jewish Center by dedicating an award in memory of this teenager who was on equally strong footing in the basketball court as he was in the beth midrash (house of study). * The Jewish Children's Museum, dedicated in memory of Ari Halberstam. * Ari's Law: requiring a license in order to possess a gun kit from which a firearm could be produced. * Torah Scroll: Completed on the first anniversary of Ari's murder, written entirely by his uncle. * The Ari Shul (Chabad): Being constructed currently in Tacoma for the Chabad of Pierce County by Rabbi Zalman Heber for their congregation.  Convictions Bassam Reyati, uncle of Baz and the owner of the car, was convicted of concealing evidence, and was sentenced to 5 years of probation and a $1,000 fine on October 16, 1996. Hilal Abd Al-Aziz Muhammad, owner of the car repair shop Baz used to hide the damage to his car, was convicted of concealing evidence and hindering prosecution. He was sentenced to five years of probation on May 17, 1995. Albert Jeanniton was convicted for illegally selling one of the guns obtained by Baz. In 2000, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York (Manhattan) Mary Jo White and the Federal Bureau of Investigation re- classified the attack as \\"the crimes of a terrorist.\\" Rashid Baz's defense team portrayed him as suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder due to his childhood exposure to violence during the Lebanese Civil War. They argued further that Baz's actions were triggered by Cave of the Patriarchs massacre of 29 people in Hebron. The jury rejected this argument, and on December 1, 1994, Baz was convicted on one count of murder, 14 counts of attempted murder, and one count of criminal use of a firearm. On January 18, 1995, judge Harold Rothwax sentenced Baz to 141 years to life in prison. Baz was initially imprisoned at the Auburn Correctional Facility in upstate New York and later transferred to the Clinton Correctional Facility.http://nysdoccslookup.doccs.ny.gov/GCA00P00/WIQ3/WINQ130 Despite the conviction of Baz, the Halberstam family and others wanted the case reclassified as a terrorist attack and wanted a further investigation to probe any terrorist links to Baz. On August 26, 1999, the United States Department of Justice and FBI agreed to open an investigation into Baz. The investigation did not yield any new leads connected to terrorist organizations but the Justice Department did formally reclassify the incident as an act of terrorism.

The film is a co-production between France & the UK, produced by Id√©ale Audience and in association with UK's Peter Moores Foundation. Interpretation In November 2005, it was announced that, as part of the 250th anniversary celebration of Mozart's birthday, a new film version of The Magic Flute, set during World War I, was to be made, directed by Kenneth Branagh, with a translation by Stephen Fry. The film was presented at the Toronto International Film Festival on 7 September 2006, at the Venice Film Festival on 8 September of that year, and released in Switzerland on 5 April 2007. The film, with a soundtrack performed by the Chamber Orchestra of Europe conducted by James Conlon, is the first motion picture version of the opera specifically intended for cinemas. Ingmar Bergman's 1975 film version was made for Swedish television and only later released to theatres. Branagh's version was shot in Super 35 and released in anamorphic widescreen, while Bergman's was filmed in Academy ratio for television sets of the 1970s. The story, which has been updated to a World War I setting, follows the structure of the original opera libretto. Tamino is sent by the Queen of the Night to rescue her daughter Pamina after Sarastro has apparently kidnapped her. His sidekick is Papageno, a man who uses underground pigeons to check for poison gas. Sarastro, in charge of a field hospital, is Pamina's father. A DVD of the film was released in France in August 2007 with a bonus soundtrack CD (lasting around 79 minutes) and a \\"Making of\\" featurette (50 minutes).Review of European DVD in LA Times The film has also been released on DVD in the Netherlands (in a three-disc set), Finland, Argentina, and Japan. Revolver Entertainment gave the film a theatrical release in the United States in June 2013, seven years after its premiere in Europe. Casting Branagh consulted with conductor James Conlon over casting choices.

On 11 June 2013, seven years after its premiere, the film was finally released on a Region 1 DVD in the United States. Critical reception Varietys Derek Elley gave the film a mixed review. Total Film mistakenly blamed Mozart for the \\"silliness of the story\\". In 2009, three years after the release of the film, Roger Lanser received a Cinematographer of the Year Award from the Australian Cinematographers Society for his work on The Magic Flute.

It is characterized by monotheistic Trinitarianism, belief in the Incarnation of the essentially divine Logos or only-begotten Son of God, a balancing of cataphatic theology with apophatic theology, a hermeneutic defined by a polyvalent Sacred Tradition, a concretely catholic ecclesiology, a robust theology of the person, and a principally recapitulative and therapeutic soteriology. Holy Tradition=Ecclesiology the Emperor Constantine (centre) and the bishops of the First Council of Nicaea (325) holding the Niceno‚ÄìConstantinopolitan Creed of 381. The Eastern Orthodox Church considers itself to be the one, holy, catholic and apostolic church established by Christ and his apostles. For the early years of the church, much of what was conveyed to its members was in the form of oral teachings. Within a very short period of time traditions were established to reinforce these teachings. The Eastern Orthodox Church asserts to have been very careful in preserving these traditions. When questions of belief or new concepts arise, the Church always refers back to the original faith. Eastern Orthodox see the Bible as a collection of inspired texts that sprang out of this tradition, not the other way around; and the choices made in forming the New Testament as having come from comparison with already firmly established faith. The Bible has come to be a very important part of \\"Tradition\\", but not the only part. Likewise, the Eastern Orthodox Church has always recognized the gradual development in the complexity of the articulation of the Church's teachings. It does not, however, believe that truth changes, and it therefore always supports its previous beliefs all the way back to what it holds to be the direct teachings from the Apostles. The Church also understands that not everything is perfectly clear; therefore, it has always accepted a fair amount of contention about certain issues, arguments about certain points, as something that will always be present within the Church. It is this contention which, through time, clarifies the truth. The Church sees this as the action of the Holy Spirit on history to manifest truth to man. The Church is unwavering in upholding its dogmatic teachings, but does not insist upon those matters of faith which have not been specifically defined. The Eastern Orthodox believe that there must always be room for mystery when speaking of God. Individuals are permitted to hold theologoumena (private theological opinions) so long as they do not contradict traditional Eastern Orthodox teaching. Sometimes, various Holy Fathers may have contradictory opinions about a certain question, and where no consensus exists, the individual is free to follow his or her conscience. Tradition also includes the Nicene Creed, the decrees of the Seven Ecumenical Councils, the writings of the Church Fathers, as well as Eastern Orthodox laws (canons), liturgical books and icons, etc. In defense of extrabiblical tradition, the Eastern Orthodox Church quotes Paul: \\"Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye have been taught, whether by our spoken word, or by our epistle.\\" (2 Thessalonians 2:15). The Eastern Orthodox Church also believes that the Holy Spirit works through history to manifest truth to the Church, and that He weeds out falsehood in order that the Truth may be recognised more fully. Consensus of the Fathers Eastern Orthodoxy interprets truth based on three witnesses: the consensus of the Holy Fathers of the Church; the ongoing teaching of the Holy Spirit guiding the life of the Church through the nous, or mind of the Church (also called the \\"Universal Consciousness of the Church\\"Pomazansky, op. cit., p. 35), which is believed to be the Mind of Christ (); and the praxis of the church (including among other things asceticism, liturgy, hymnography and iconography). The consensus of the Church over time defines its catholicity--that which is believed at all times by the entire Church. St. Vincent of Lerins, wrote in his Commonitoria (434 AD), that Church doctrine, like the human body, develops over time while still keeping its original identity: \\"[I]n the Orthodox Church itself, all possible care must be taken, that we hold that faith which has been believed everywhere, always, by all\\"(Chap. XXIII, ¬ß¬ß 54‚Äì59) Those who disagree with that consensus are not accepted as authentic \\"Fathers.\\" All theological concepts must be in agreement with that consensus. Even those considered to be authentic \\"Fathers\\" may have some theological opinions that are not universally shared, but are not thereby considered heretical. Some Holy Fathers have even made statements that were later defined as heretical, but their mistakes do not exclude them from position of authority (heresy is a sin of pride; unintended error does not make one a heretic, only the refusal to accept a dogma which has been defined by the church). Thus an Eastern Orthodox Christian is not bound to agree with every opinion of every Father, but rather with the consensus of the Fathers, and then only on those matters about which the church is dogmatic. Some of the greatest theologians in the history of the church come from the 4th century, including the Cappadocian Fathers and the Three Hierarchs. However, the Eastern Orthodox do not consider the \\"Patristic era\\" to be a thing of the past, but that it continues in an unbroken succession of enlightened teachers (i.e., the saints, especially those who have left us theological writings) from the Apostles to the present day. Scripture Georgian Bible, 1030 A.D, depicting the Raising of Lazarus. Many modern Christians approach the Bible and its interpretation as the sole authority to the establishment of their beliefs concerning the world and their salvation. From the Eastern Orthodox point of view, the Bible represents those texts approved by the church for the purpose of conveying the most important parts of what it already believes. The Church more or less accepted the preexisting Greek Septuagint version of Hebrew Scriptures as handed down to them from the Jews; but the New Testament texts were written to members or congregations of the Church which already existed. These texts were not universally considered canonical until the church reviewed, edited, accepted and ratified them in 368 AD. The Greeks, having a highly sophisticated and philosophical language, have always understood that certain sections of Scripture, while containing moral lessons and complex truth, do not necessarily have to be interpreted literally. The Eastern Orthodox also understand that a particular passage may be interpreted on many different levels simultaneously. However, interpretation is not a matter of personal opinion (). For this reason, Eastern Orthodox depend upon the consensus of the Holy Fathers to provide a trustworthy guide to the accurate interpretation of Scripture. Eastern Orthodox Christianity is a strongly biblical church. A large portion of the Daily Office is made up of either direct portions of scripture (Psalms, lections) or allusions to scriptural passages or themes (hymnography such as that contained in the Octoechos, Triodion, Pentecostarion, etc.) The entire Psalter is read in the course of a week (twice during Great Lent). The entire New Testament (with the exception of the Book of Revelation) is read during the course of the year, and numerous passages are read from the Old Testament at Vespers and other services. The Gospel Book is considered to be an icon of Christ, and is placed in a position of honour on the Holy Table (altar). The Gospel Book is traditionally not covered in leather (the skin of a dead animal) because the Word of God is considered to be life-giving. Traditionally, the Gospel is covered in gold or cloth. Eastern Orthodox Christians are encouraged to read and study the Bible daily, especially making use of the writings of the Holy Fathers for guidance. Recent essays have emerged by various contemporary Eastern Orthodox scholars which attempt to reconcile and react to both the Creationist interpretation of Genesis 1-2 and the strict Darwinist theory of human evolution. God in Trinity \\"Hospitality of Abraham\\" icon by Andrei Rublev; the three angels represent the three persons of God Eastern Orthodox Christians believe in a single God who is both three and one (triune); the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, \\"one in essence and undivided\\". The Holy Trinity is three \\"unconfused\\" and distinct divine persons (hypostases), who share one divine essence (ousia); uncreated, immaterial and eternal. The Father is the eternal source of the Godhead, from whom the Son is begotten eternally and also from whom the Holy Spirit proceeds eternally. The essence of God being that which is beyond human comprehension and cannot be defined or approached by human understanding.  Christology  Eastern Orthodox Christians believe the incarnate Word of God is one person in two natures, both fully divine and fully human, perfectly God (œÑŒ≠ŒªŒµŒπŒøœÇ ŒòŒµœåœÇ) and perfectly man (œÑŒ≠ŒªŒµŒπŒøœÇ Œ¨ŒΩŒ∏œÅœâœÄŒøœÇ). Throughout the ages this has been a point of contention between schismatic Christian theological factions (heterodox) and the mainstream body of Christian believers (orthodox). Christ had a divine will, or set of desires and spiritual incentives, and a human will with fleshly drives. He had a human body, human mind, and human spirit able to be tempted with sin and to suffer the same way as we would. In this way God is said to have suffered and died in the flesh of Jesus, although the divine nature is itself impassible and immortal. Eastern Orthodox Christians believe that Jesus of Nazareth is the promised Messiah of the Jews, the God of Israel come to be with His people, the Redeemer of the human race who saves the world from sin and its effects, the comprehensible self-revelation of the incomprehensible God, and the pre-eternal Son begotten of the Father before all ages: \\"the only-begotten Son of God, begotten of the Father before all worlds (√¶ons), Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father.\\"Nicene Creed He is said to have been begotten timelessly as God without a mother and begotten in history as man without a father. Eastern Orthodox Christians believe in the betrayal, trial, execution, burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ, that he truly rose from the dead on the third day following his crucifixion. The feast of the resurrection of Christ, which is called \\"Easter\\" in Germanic languages, is known as Pascha in the Eastern Orthodox Church. This is the Aramaic variant (the language spoken at the time of Jesus) of the Hebrew Pesach, meaning \\"Passover\\". The resurrection of Christ is the Christian Passover. Pascha is called \\"the Feast of Feasts\\" and is considered the greatest feast of all the Church's liturgical feasts, including the feasts of the Nativity (Christmas) and the Annunciation. Essence and energies In discussing God's relationship to his creation a distinction is made within Eastern Orthodox theology between God's eternal essence and uncreated energies, though it is understood that this does not compromise the divine simplicity. Energies and essence are both inseparably God. The divine energies are the expressions of divine being in action according to Eastern Orthodox doctrine, whereas the persons of the Trinity are divine by nature. Hence, created beings are united to God through participation in the divine energies and not the divine essence or ousia. Theodicy The Eastern Orthodox theologian Olivier Clement,In Memoriam: Olivier Cl√©ment wrote: These concepts theodicy and the problem of evil from an Eastern Orthodox perspective stems from misconception about the anthropology of man (i.e., free will and divine omnipotence).http://www.fatheralexander.org/booklets/english/parables_potapov.htm Gospel parables, an Eastern Orthodox commentary By Father Victor Potapov In the earliest years of the Christian community labeled Gnostics (by church fathers such as Irenaeus) attacked the Jewish God and the story of cosmic creation contained in the Torah. Much of these Gnostic sects attacked the Jewish creator YHWH as inferior due to the Jewish God allowing his creation to be imperfect or allowing the occurrence of negative events. The clearest example of this foolish or wicked creator god is in modern terms expressed in the philosophical concept termed \\"the problem of evil.\\" Western Roman Catholic philosophers (such as Augustine, Anselm of Canterbury, Thomas Aquinas following Augustinian theodicy)God and evil: an introduction to the issues By Michael L. Peterson pg 94 have attempted to make apologies for the Judeo- Christian God due to this characteristic of the material world, under the term theodicy. The early church fathers addressed this form of fatalism (a more modern secular term for these teachings would be either necessitarianism or theological determinism) as it taught that humanity had no significant free will; Judeo-Christians taught humanity has indeterminate free will (a philosophical position called libertarianism). The Church taught (against the Gnostics) that the cosmos is fallen but not due to God creating it dysfunctional, but rather because Man misused his freedom of will to choose a path which separates him from God, i.e., to exist within the Divine will in perfect relationship, and idolatrously proclaimed his self-sufficiency. When humanity made this choice it is taught in Eastern patristics that reality or every sphere of human influence and participation \\"fell\\" and was corrupted, leading indeterminacy (a necessary condition for morally significant free will in a mode of separation from God) to be infused into human existence. As a result of this randomness or indeterminacy, good and bad befall all people whether they are of good or bad character. The first condition of this change was the Eastern understanding of creation which stands in radical contrast to the fatalist approach to sin as taught by the Gnostic sectarians, and later by strict Augustinians. In that God created sarx (\\"the flesh\\") as a provision for Man, led by the Spirit of God, to remedy his fallen state by using his time on earth to seek and reconcile with God, even while our common sarx separates us from God. The notion that the Eastern Orthodox see theodicy as an exclusively Western preoccupation is belied by writings such as Pavel Florensky's The Pillar and Ground of the Truth: An Essay in Orthodox Theodicy in Twelve Letters; Archbishop Stylianos's Theodicy and Eschatology: A Fundamental Orthodox Viewpoint in Theodicy and Eschatology (Australian Theological Forum Press 2005 ); Tsunami and Theodicy by David B. Hart, an Eastern Orthodox theologian and author of The Beauty of the Infinite; \\"The Lady and the Wench\\": A Practical Theodicy in Russian Literature by Paul Valliere; and with regard to one of the Fathers of the Church Irenaeus' Theodicy. Sin The Eastern Orthodox approach to sin, and how it is dealt with, shuns perceived Western \\"legalism.\\" Following rules strictly without the heart \\"being in it\\" does not help a believer with his salvation. Sin is not fundamentally about transgressing a Divine law; rather, it is a label attributed to any behavior which \\"misses the mark,\\" that is, fails to live up to the higher goal of conforming to God's nature. Thus, in the Eastern Orthodox tradition sin is not viewed primarily as a guilty stain on the soul that needs to be wiped out, but rather as a pervading sickness or a failure to achieve the goal of the truly human life, fulfilling one's Divine design and function as the created image of God. Sin, therefore, does not merely imply guilt for violating a commandment, but rather the impetus to become something other than what we are. Because each person's experience is unique, conquering one's sinful habits requires individual attention and correction. The ultimate goal for this salvific process is to become divinized, to reflect the Divine likeness by becoming Christ-like in one's thought, life and behavior. A traditional practice of Eastern Orthodoxy is, as in other apostolic churches, to have a spiritual mentor and guide to whom one confesses and who treats the sin on an individual basis. An experienced and spiritually mature guide will know how and when to apply strictness in dealing with sin and when to administer mercy. Original sin In Eastern Orthodoxy, God created man perfect with free will and gave man a direction to follow. Man (Adam) and Woman (Eve) chose rather to disobey God by eating from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, thus changing the \\"perfect\\" mode of existence of Man to the flawed or \\"fallen\\" mode of existence of Man. This fallen nature and all that has come from it is a result of \\"original sin.\\" All humanity participates in the sin of Adam because like him, they are human and follow in his ways. The union of humanity with divinity in Jesus Christ restored, in the Person of Christ, the mode of existence of humanity, so that those who are incorporated in him may participate in this renewal of the perfect mode of existence, be saved from sin and death, and be united to God in deification. Original sin is cleansed in humans through baptism or, in the case of the Theotokos, the moment Christ took form within her. This view differs from the Roman Catholic doctrine of original sin, the legacy of Latin father Augustine of Hippo, in that Man is not seen as inherently guilty of the sin committed by Adam, conceived as the federal head and legal representative of the human race. According to the Orthodox, humanity inherited the consequences of that sin, not the guilt. The difference stems from Augustine's interpretation of a Latin translation of Romans 5:12 to mean that through Adam all men sinned, whereas the Orthodox reading in Greek interpret it as meaning that all of humanity sins as part of the inheritance of flawed nature from Adam. The Orthodox Church does not teach that all are born guilty and deserving of damnation, and Protestant doctrines such as predestination which are derived from the Augustinian theory of original sin and are especially prominent in the Lutheran and Calvinist traditions, are not a part of Orthodox belief. In the book Ancestral Sin, John S. Romanides addresses the concept of original sin, which he understands as an inheritance of ancestral sin from previous generations. Romanides asserts that original sin (understood as innate guilt) is not an apostolic doctrine of the Church nor cohesive with the Eastern Orthodox faith, but rather an unfortunate innovation of later church fathers such as Augustine. In the realm of ascetics it is by choice, not birth, that one takes on the sins of the world. Hell Detail of Hell in a painting depicting the Second Coming (Georgios Klontzas, late 16th century) The Eastern Orthodox Church, as well as the Non- Chalcedonian Churches (i.e., Oriental Orthodoxy and Assyrian Church of the East), teach that both the elect and the lost enter into the presence of God after death, and that the elect experience this presence as light and rest, while the lost experience it as darkness and torment.Heaven, Hell, and the Afterlife According to the Bible, an Orthodox account The Orthodox see this doctrine as supported by Scripture and by the patristic tradition. Hell as professed in the East is neither the absence of God, nor the ontological separation of the soul from the presence of God, but rather the opposite‚ÄîHeaven and Hell are the fully manifest divine presence, experienced either pleasantly as peace and joy or unpleasantly as shame and anguish, depending upon one's spiritual state and preparedness. Salvation Orthodox icon of the Resurrection (14th-century fresco, Chora Church, Istanbul). Disrupted communion with God Eastern Orthodox Christians hold that man was originally created in communion with God, but through acting in a manner contrary to his own nature (which is intrinsically ordered to communion with God), he disrupted that communion. Because of man's refusal to fulfill the \\"image and likeness of God\\" within him, corruption and the sickness of sin whose consequence is death entered man's mode of existence. But when Jesus came into the world He Himself was Perfect Man and Perfect God united in the divine Hypostasis of the Logos, the Second Person of the Holy Trinity. Through his assumption of human nature, human existence was restored, enabling human beings, the fulfilment of creation, through participation in divinity by incorporation into Jesus Christ. St. Athanasius: Salvation, or \\"being saved,\\" therefore, refers to this process of being saved from death and corruption and the fate of hell. The Orthodox Church believes that its teachings and practices represent the true path to participation in the gifts of God. Yet, it should be understood that the Orthodox do not believe that you must be Orthodox to participate in salvation. God is merciful to all. The Orthodox believe that there is nothing that a person (Orthodox or non-Orthodox) can do to earn salvation. It is rather a gift from God. However, this gift of relationship has to be accepted by the believer, since God will not force salvation on humanity. Man is free to reject the gift of salvation continually offered by God. To be saved, man must work together with God in a synergeia whereby his entire being, including his will, effort and actions, are perfectly conformed with, and united to, the divine. Vladimir Lossky: Incarnation Prior to Christ's incarnation on Earth it was man's \\"fate\\", when he died, because of the fall of Adam, to be separated from God. Because man distorted his mode of existence through acting against what was natural to him - thus disobeying God - humanity placed itself in a terrible and inescapable position. God, however, raised humanity's fallen nature, to unite his divine nature with our human nature. This he accomplished through the Incarnation of the Second Person of the Holy Trinity, who assumed human nature, thus becoming man, whilst retaining the divine nature proper to divinity. It is fundamental for Orthodox Christians that they accept Christ as both God and Man, both natures complete. This is viewed as the only way of escaping the hell of separation from God. The incarnation unites humanity to divinity. Orthodox Christians believe that because of that Incarnation, everything is different. It is said that St Basil stated: \\"We are to strive to become little gods, within God, little jesus christs within Jesus Christ\\". In other words, Orthodox Christians must seek perfection in all things in their lives; and strive to acquire Godly virtue. It is believed that God, through assuming humanity, makes it possible for man to participate in divinity. Orthodox Christians do not believe in becoming \\"separate\\" gods in the pagan sense; rather, they believe that humans may participate in the divine energies of God without loss of their personal particularity. Humans, therefore, become by grace what God is by nature. Resurrection The Resurrection of Christ is the central event in the liturgical year of the Orthodox Church and is understood in literal terms as a real historical event. Jesus Christ, the Son of God, was crucified and died, descended into Hades, rescued all the souls held there through man's original sin; and then, because Hades could not restrain the infinite God, rose from the dead, thus saving all humanity. Through these events, he released humanity from the bonds of Hades and then came back to the living as man and God. That each individual human may partake of this immortality, which would have been impossible without the Resurrection, is the main promise held out by God in his New Covenant with humanity, according to Orthodox Christian tradition. Every holy day of the Orthodox liturgical year relates to the Resurrection directly or indirectly. Every Sunday of the year is dedicated to celebrating the Resurrection; many Orthodox believers will refrain from kneeling or prostrating on Sundays in observance thereof. Even in the liturgical commemorations of the Passion of Christ during Holy Week, there are frequent allusions to the ultimate victory at its completion. Deification The ultimate goal of the Orthodox Christian is to achieve theosis (\\"deification\\") or conformity to and intimate union with God. This is sometimes expressed thus: \\"God became man so that Man might become god.\\" Some of the greatest saints have achieved, in this life, a measure of this process. The individual who achieves theosis never realizes his accomplishment, as his perfect humility keeps him blind to pride. Salvation therefore is not merely an escape from the eternal bondage of death, but an entrance to life in Christ here and now. Noetic renewal as spiritual therapy A central concept in Eastern Christianity is nous (typically translated \\"mind\\" or \\"understanding\\"), the apperceptive and relational faculty of attention or awareness which is the center, heart, or spirit of the person.Orthodox Psychotherapy. Chapter III by Metropolitan Hierotheos Vlachos published by Birth of Theotokos Monastery, Greece (January 1, 2005) Nous is the eye or soul of the person.What is the Human Nous? by John Romanides Orthodox Psychotherapy Section The Knowledge of God according to St. Gregory Palamas by Metropolitan Metropolitan Hierotheos published by Birth of Theotokos Monastery, Greece (January 1, 2005) It is the nous that is both logical and intuitive understanding. It was humanity's nous that was damaged by Adam's sin and fall and it was this damaged consciousness that each human by birth now receives. It is the nous which has to be healed and nourished by means of illumination (see theoria).Orthodox Dogmatic Theology: A Concise Exposition Protopresbyter Michael Pomazansky Appendices New currents in Russian philosophico-theological thought Philosophy and Theology. In Orthodox thought, the Church offers a therapeutic treatment for pain, suffering, and the search for value in existence. Orthodox Christianity is healing or therapeutic, and works in each individual to overcome their passions (i.e. evil thoughts, pasts, addictions). As a reorientation of the self, faith (pistis) is sometimes used interchangeably with noesis in Eastern Christianity.Nikitas Stithatos-On the Inner Nature of Things and on the Purification of the Intellect: One Hundred Texts Palmer, G.E.H; Sherrard, Philip; Ware, Kallistos (Timothy). The Philokalia, Vol. 4 Faith is the intuitive, noetic experience of the nous or spirit. Transformative faith is a gift from God and among his uncreated operations.Glossary of terms from the Philokalia pg 430 Palmer, G.E.H; Sherrard; Ware, Kallistos (Timothy). The Philokalia, Vol. 4 According to anti-Latin polemicist John Romanides, Western Christianity does not offer a spiritual cure for spiritual problems, but express salvation as a worldly (religious) goal in the pursuit of happiness, rather than seeking to attain the vision of God and transcend the self.The Cure Of The Neurobiological Sickness Of Religion The Hellenic Civilization Of The Roman Empire, Charlemagne's Lie Of 794, And His Lie Today by John S. Romanides Spiritual work is done to reconcile the heart and mind, by putting the mind in the heart, and then contemplating through our intuition. According to Lossky, rationalism reduces man and nature to cold mechanical concepts, interpretations and symbols of reality not reality in and of itself.History of Russian Philosophy by Nikolai Lossky p. 87 Mother of God The Theotokos of Vladimir, one of the most venerated of Orthodox Christian icons of the Virgin Mary. A great many traditions revolve around the Ever-Virgin Mary, the Theotokos, the Birth-giver of the preeternal Word of God, which are theologically paramount. It is believed by Orthodox Christians that she was and remained a virgin before and after Christ's birth. Many of the Church's beliefs concerning the Virgin Mary are reflected in the apocryphal text \\"The Nativity of Mary\\", which was not included in scripture, but is considered to be accurate in its description of events. The child Mary was consecrated at the age of three to serve in the temple as a temple virgin. Zachariah, at that time High Priest of the Temple, did the unthinkable and carried Mary into the Holy of Holies as a sign of her importance ‚Äì that she herself would become the ark in which God would take form. At the age of twelve she was required to give up her position and marry, but she desired to remain forever a virgin in dedication to God. And so it was decided to marry her to a close relative, Joseph, an uncle or cousin, an older man, a widower, who would take care of her and allow her to retain her virginity. And so it was that when the time came she submitted to God‚Äôs will and allowed the Christ to take form within her. It is believed by many Orthodox that she, in her life, committed no sin; however, the Orthodox do not accept the Roman Catholic doctrine of the Immaculate conception. The Theotokos was subject to original sin as the Orthodox understand it, yet she lived her life stainless and pure. In the theology of the Orthodox Church, it is most important to understand that Christ, from the very moment of conception, was fully God and fully man. Therefore, Orthodox Christians believe that it is correct to say that Mary is indeed the Theotokos, the Birth-giver of God, and that she is the greatest of all humans ever to have lived (except, of course, for Christ her Son). The term 'Theotokos' has tremendous theological significance to Orthodox Christians, as it was at the center of the Christological debates of the 4th and 5th centuries AD. After her great role was accomplished, the Church believes she remained a virgin, continuing to serve God in all ways. She traveled much with her son, and was present both at his Passion on the Cross and at his ascension into heaven. It is also believed that she was the first to know of her son's resurrection ‚Äì the Archangel Gabriel appearing to her once more and revealing it to her. It is believed she lived to the age of seventy and called all the apostles to her before she died. According to tradition Saint Thomas arrived late and was not present at her death. Desiring to kiss her hand one last time he opened her tomb but her body was gone. The Orthodox believe she was assumed into heaven bodily; however, unlike in the Roman Catholic Church, it is not a dogmatic prescription and the holy day is usually referred to as the Feast of the Dormition, not that of the Assumption. Saints, relics, and the deceased Relics of Saint Demetrius in Thessalonika, Greece. In the Eastern Orthodox Church a saint is defined as anyone who is currently in Heaven, whether recognized here on earth or not. By this definition, Adam and Eve, Moses, the various prophets, martyrs for the faith, the angels and archangels are all given the title of Saint. There is a service in the Orthodox Church in which a saint is formally recognized by the entire Church, called glorification. This does not, however, \\"make\\" a saint but simply accords him or her a place on the calendar with regular services in his honor. Recently, in order to avoid abuses, the Ecumenical Patriarchate in Constantinople has begun to follow the longstanding practice of other local Orthodox churches by issuing special encyclical letters (tomoi) in which the Church acknowledges the popular veneration of a saint. Glorification usually happens after believers have already begun venerating a saint. There are numerous small local followings of countless saints that have not yet been recognized by the entire Orthodox Church. A strong element in favor of glorification can be the perceived \\"miraculous\\" condition of physical remains (relics), although that alone is not considered sufficient. In some Orthodox countries it is the custom to re-use graves after three to five years due to limited space. Bones are respectfully washed and placed in an ossuary, often with the person's name written on the skull. Occasionally when a body is exhumed something believed to be miraculous occurs to reveal the person's sainthood. There have been numerous occurrences where the exhumed bones are said to suddenly give off a wonderful fragrance, like flowers; or sometimes the body is said to be found incorrupt despite having not been embalmed (traditionally the Orthodox do not embalm the dead) and having been buried for three years. For the Orthodox, body and soul both comprise the person, and in the end, body and soul will be reunited; therefore, the body of a saint shares in the holiness of the soul of the saint. Orthodox venerate saints and ask for their prayers, and consider them brothers and sisters in Christ Jesus. Saints are venerated and loved and asked to intercede for salvation, but they are not given the worship accorded to God, because their holiness is believed to come from God. In fact, anyone who worships a saint, relics, or icons is to be excommunicated. As a general rule only clergy will touch relics in order to move them or carry them in procession; however, in veneration the faithful will kiss the relic to show love and respect toward the saint. Every altar in every Orthodox church contains relics, usually of a martyr. The Church building interiors are covered with the icons of saints. The Orthodox Church sees baptism, both for infants and adults, as the moment one is incorporated into Christ. The person baptised is given a new name, always the name of a saint. As well as birthdays, Orthodox celebrate the day of the saint for whom the person is named (the person's name day).

After a long association with Island Records, this was Martyn's first of two albums for WEA. The album was produced by Phil Collins and engineered by Nick Launay and Steve Travell. The album is named for the title track satirizing Ronald Reagan's ascent to the White House as the 40th U.S. President. Opening track \\"Couldn't Love You More\\" is a re-worked arrangement of the song that originally appeared on 1977's One World. The original acoustic version is here re-recorded as a full-band track, featuring a guest appearance from Eric Clapton. Clapton covered Martyn's \\"May You Never\\" on his 1977 album Slowhand. When Martyn was presented with a lifetime achievement award by Collins at the 2008 BBC Folk Awards, Clapton sent a message saying that he was \\"so far ahead of everything else it was inconceivable\\". \\"Couldn't Love You More\\", in its various forms, remained a fixture of Martyn's live performances. Irish Musician Lisa Hannigan has described the song as one of her favourites, covering the song with Faultline in 2006. In August 1981, \\"Please Fall In Love With Me\\"/\\"Don't You Go\\" was released as a single. More mainstream in production compared to Martyn's previous albums, and helped by promotion in the way of a 32-date UK tour, Glorious Fool charted at #25 on its release.

It is the second step of a convergent approach. First, smaller peptides containing 30-50 amino acids are prepared by conventional chemical peptide synthesis. Then, they are completely deprotected. Chemical ligation is the technique of coupling these peptides by chemoselective reaction to give a unique reaction product, usually in aqueous solution. With several coupling steps, proteins of up to 200-300 amino acids can be produced. Methods of chemical ligation There are various techniques described in literature. The most practical and robust method for the chemoselective reaction of unprotected peptides is native chemical ligation. Native chemical ligation has overcome the limitations of the classical synthetic organic chemistry approach to the total synthesis of proteins, and enables the routine total or semi- synthesis of protein molecules. The original chemical ligation methods involved the formation of a non-native bond at the ligation site. Subsequently, native chemical ligation was developed. In native chemical ligation, an unprotected peptide-thioester reacts with a Cys-peptide to give a ligation product with a native amide ('peptide') bond at the ligation site. In this method, the initial thioester-linked ligation product intermediate rearranges to form an amide bond. Native chemical ligation relies on the presence of a cysteine residue at the ligation site. Methods using removable auxiliary groups can in some instances extend the use of native chemical ligation to non-cysteine residues, as can the use of desulfurization subsequent to the ligation (e.g. converting a Cys to an Ala). Expressed protein ligation By exploiting naturally occurring inteins it is possible to prepare a recombinant polypeptide C-terminal thioester. This enables the use of large recombinant protein-derived thioesters in native chemical ligation. The recombinant thioester can be ligated to a synthetic peptide bearing an N-terminal cysteine. Native chemical ligation of this kind using recombinant C-terminal thioesters is known as expressed protein ligation. Recombinant expression can also be used to give a Cys-polypeptide for use in native chemical ligation. Staudinger ligation The Staudinger ligation, first reported in 2000, in principle enables the ligation of peptide segments independent of the terminal amino acids. The method is based on the Staudinger reaction. The Staudinger ligation continues to be developed and has not yet found widespread use. Ser/Thr ligation Ser/Thr ligation (STL) was introduced into protein chemical synthesis as an alternative ligation strategy. STL involves merger of a side-chain unprotected peptide segment containing a C-terminal salicylaldehyde (SAL) ester and another peptide segment with an N-terminal Ser or Thr residue. The chemoselective reaction between the peptide SAL ester and 1,2-hydroxylamine group of Ser or Thr leads to the formation of an N,O-benzylidene acetal linked intermediate, which undergoes acidolysis to afford a natural peptidic Xaa-Ser/Thr linkage. This method does not involve the use of unnatural amino acids, and it is simple to operate. Ser/Thr ligation provides a complementary method for protein chemical synthesis and semisynthesis.

Glemsford is located near the River Glem and the River Stour also flows nearby. Glemsford is surrounded by arable farmland and is not far from historic Suffolk villages such as Lavenham and Long Melford. History Monks Hall The village dates back to the Domesday Book in 1086, in which Glemsford was recorded. The village has noteworthy features such as Monks Hall, which is a medieval timber structure. It is said that a tunnel once connected Monks Hall to the nearby Parish Church of St Mary the Virgin, which the monks formerly used to access the church instead of mixing with the ordinary villagers. Only a small part of this tunnel remains. The Parish Church of St Mary the Virgin dates back to the early 14th century, with the earliest recorded rector being Hugh de Poynton in 1302. The church features the Golding Chapel, built in memory of the rich Glemsford cloth merchant, John Golding. Golding lived in the Angel House, another timber building adjacent to The Angel public house, which serves traditional real ales. Golding left money for the chapel to be built when he died, likewise as with other parish churches St Mary's Church tower was rebuilt in the 19th century. Monks Hall itself has gone through changes of use and appearance through the centuries and is now a private residence. Glemsford Methodist Church is situated at the other end of the village and dates from the Victorian era. In the early 16th century, Glemsford became the home of George Cavendish who was a local nobleman and gentleman-usher to Cardinal Thomas Wolsey. Upon Wolsey's death in 1530, Cavendish retired to Glemsford and in the mid-1550s he finalized a biography on Cardinal Wolsey which was published after his own death in 1562. The village and the surrounding area, like much of East Anglia, was strongly Puritan during much of the 17th century. By 1640, several families had departed for the Massachusetts Bay Colony as part of the wave of emigration that occurred during the Great Migration.Thompson, Roger, Mobility & Migration, East Anglian Founders of New England, 1629-1640, Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 1994. Glemsford railway station was on the route between Sudbury and Cambridge, known as the Stour Valley Railway. The station opened in the 1860s and saw its busiest period during the First and Second World Wars when it, along with nearby Cavendish station, was bombed. This was because Glemsford station was one of the places which harboured ammunition trains. The station was closed during the Beeching Axe in 1967; only the Station House (now private), goods shed (now converted to flats) and one level crossing post remain. 'The Angel' inn, Glemsford Glemsford is a large and rather industrial village by Suffolk standards; it also has a considerable number of shops and public houses. Among the public houses are The Black Lion, a Medieval timber building, The Angel, The Cock Inn, and The Cherry Tree.

Synopsis Chow Yun-fat plays Ah-Long, a single father trying to raise his son, Porky (Wong Kwan-yuen), on a low-income lifestyle. Ah-Long works as a truckdriver at a construction site. The son's real mother, Por-por, who is Ah-Long's ex-girlfriend (played by Sylvia Chang) left him ten years ago for the United States after a lovers' spat. Ten years ago, Por-por had become Ah-Long's lover despite her mother's objections. As Por-por was giving birth in the hospital, Ah-Long was involved in illegal racing. Ah-Long was put behind bars. Por-por's mother lied to her and told her that her baby did not survive. Por-por was devastated and left for the United States to become a director. It is now ten years on. Por-por returns from the United States with a boyfriend to shoot a video commercial. Life is hard for both Ah-Long and Porky but Porky manages to do well in school. An audition is held for a video commercial and the advertising company wants to engage Porky. Ah-Long visits the advertising company's office and finds out that Por-por is in charge. He is dismayed to discover that Por-por has a boyfriend. Por-por is all business-like because she does not realise at that stage that Porky is in fact her own son. However Por-por instantly feels an affinity to Porky. Por- por eventually finds out that Porky is her son. Por-por begins to bond with her son that she never knew. Por-por wants to reunite with her son. During an argument Porky tells Ah-Long that he is dismayed at his life. Porky says that he wants to go live with his mother. Ah-Long sends Porky to stay with Por-por for a while. As Ah-Long and Por-por slowly get reacquainted, Ah-Long is happy and thinks that Por-por wants to rekindle the relationship. Ah-Long returns a bracelet to Por-por to imply that he is interested in restarting the relationship. Por-por reveals that she wants to bring Porky back to the United States, shattering Ah-Long's dreams of reconciliation. Ah-Long decides to try his luck at the motorbike racing accident. Ah-Long is determined to win the motorbike race to give his son a better future. Por-por's boyfriend purchases an air ticket for Por-por to return to the United States immediately. The next morning, as the motorbike race is about to begin, Ah-Long steels himself at the starting line. Por-por appears at the race track and Ah-Long manages to see Por-por as the race begins. She is wearing the bracelet and Ah-Long knows that he has been forgiven. Ah-Long and Por-por both smile at each other. The motorbikes go around the race track without a conclusive leader. During the sixth lap Ah-Long takes the leading position. Ah-Long loses control of his motorbike and crashes, causing the other riders to slow down or to crash as well. As he is struggling to get up, Ah-Long is hit by another motorbike. His head is bleeding but he is determined to complete the race. As the other motorbikes whiz by, Ah-Long picks himself up again and re-enters the race. Ah- Long is bleeding and his eyesight is starting to blur. Ah-Long manages to get to the first place. Ah-Long manages to see Porky and Por-por cheer for him as he passes them by. A moment later Ah-Long loses consciousness and plows into the side of the race track, and crashes. His motorbike catches fire. Ah-Long lies pinned under the motorbike and unable to move. Porky and Por-por run across the race track. Ah-Long reaches out to them. The motorbike explodes and Ah-Long dies.

Chow won his third Hong Kong Film Award for Best Actor for his role in the film. The drama-based film is generally hailed as one of Johnnie To's masterpieces due to its strong storyline and the excellent portrayal of the characters. To was known as a comedy/action film maker at the time and All About Ah-Long was a showcase of his versatility. Wong Kwan-yuen, who played Porky in the film, was really ten years old. Wong was born in 1978 and the film was launched in 1988. The film is also frequently cited as one of the milestones in Sylvia Chang's career.

Premozh Yacopeen), born 30 June 1949 is a Slovenian computer scientist, known for his work in the field of language technology and his contribution to speleology.  Early life and education  Jakopin was born in 1949 in Ljubljana, Slovenia. The family lived in the village of Leskovec pri Kr≈°kem, Dolenjska region and in 1956 moved to Ljubljana. After a degree in technical mathematics (Numeriƒçno raƒçunanje singularnih integralov / Numerical Computation of Singular Integrals) at the University of Ljubljana in 1972, he obtained a master's degree in information sciences with the thesis Entropija imena i prezimena u Sloveniji / On entropy of first names and last names in Slovenia at the University of Zagreb in 1981 and in 1999 a Ph.D. with the thesis Zgornja meja entropije pri leposlovnih besedilih v slovenskem jeziku / Upper Bound of Entropy in Slovenian Literary Texts, again at the University of Ljubljana.  Computational linguistics  He was a senior lecturer at the Department of Comparative and General Linguistics, Faculty of Arts, University of Ljubljana. His subjects of instruction are language technologies with stress on Lemmatisation. From 2001 to 2012 he was the Head of the Corpus Laboratory at the Fran Ramov≈° Institute of Slovenian Language (within the Scientific Research Centre of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts). He participated in a number of European projects on language resources. His major pieces of software: IBIS for the Digital DEC 10 mainframe computer, 1981, INES for the Sinclair ZX Spectrum microcomputer, 1985, STEVE (ATARI ST, 1987-1992), EVA for DOS, 1992- and Microsoft Windows family of operating systems, 1996-, NEVA - Windows server search engine, 1999-. From 1992 to 1994 he supervised the transfer of the Standard Slovenian Dictionary (SSKJ) from printed to electronic version (EVA OCR, DOS version). In 1997 he wrote the first part-of-speech tagger for Slovenian texts. In 1999 he started an Internet text corpus, with a concordance service and linked wordform and reversed wordform frequency dictionaries. It is available as Nova beseda (New word).  Speleology  3D Model of the Main Gallery in Skednena jama Cave In high school, he read the book Kra≈°ki svet in njegovi pojavi / Karst world and its phenomena by Pavel Kunaver and especially because of its photographs by Bogumil Brin≈°ek, Jakopin became interested in speleology. In 1966 he joined Ljubljana Cave Exploration Society (DZRJL) to learn more about caves and to participate in exploration of new caves. As a mathematician he was particularly interested in the principal cave size parameters, calculated from the cave survey, length and depth. They are closely related to the definition of a cave as a hollow underground formation, large enough for human exploration, and are used to compare and classify caves, for instance in the List of longest caves and in the List of deepest caves. Whereas the cave depth is well defined as the difference between the highest point and the lowest point of the cave, its length, usually given as the sum of distances between the survey stations on the cave floor, involves considerable arbitrariness. In cave science it was long known that the cave length does not represent the cave size properly as caves are 3D objects with volume as their main and most noticeable feature, yet volume was less used because of the lack of a suitable measurement method. In 1972, at the 6th Yugoslavian congress of speleology, Jakopin proposed volume as the main cave parameter in the paper O numeriƒçnem vrednotenju kra≈°kih objektov / Numerical Valuation of Objects on Karst, measured from a computer-based cave model. In 1974 he made a 3D model for approximation of cave space, based on a series of connected polygonal cross sections and used it to make a 3D survey of Skednena jama cave, a fossil ponor at the northern rim of the Planinsko polje karst field in Slovenia. By 1979 he developed a computer program to support the 3D model, to compute its vertice coordinates and to calculate the model (and cave) parameters: length, surface and volume. In 1981 Jakopin published the results for Skednena jama cave in the paper Macrostereological Evaluation of Cave Space. The model had 305 vertices, 51 cross sections, total length was 205 m, surface area 8900 m2 and volume 6.500 m3 with error estimated at below 5%. Jakopin in Maƒçkovica Cave,1981 Early in 1981 a larger cave, Maƒçkovica, located in the same area as Skednena jama cave, was surveyed. Here the model consisted of 106 cross sections and 709 vertices for the length of 650 m and volume of 38.800 m3. Volume error was estimated at below 2%. After microcomputers became widely available in the early eighties Jakopin developed a different method of volume calculation which could be performed with much less computing power. Instead of computing cave model segment parameters by cutting it iteratively into ever thinner parallel slices it was based on breaking up every segment into a series of tetrahedrons, the parameters of which can be computed directly. He implemented the updated model on a Sinclair ZX Spectrum personal home computer. In 1982 a team, lead by Jakopin, made the survey of a 450 m long section of Postojnska jama cave, from the Concert Hall to the end of the Great Mountain, and the model yielded the volume of 313.000 m3 In 1984 Daniel Roj≈°ek and his team measured a 54 m long segment of the Martel's Hall at the end of ≈†kocjanske jame caves with the volume of 220.000 m3, one tenth of the entire hall volume (2.200.000 m3), computed in 2018. It is comparable in size to other large underground chambers. In 2019 and in 2020 Jakopin wrote articles about three people who devoted most of their life to deep caves, to achieve depths greater than 2,000 meters: Pavel Demidov in Ver√´vkina Cave, Jurij Kasjan in Voronja Cave and Aleksandr Vi≈°njevskij in Boybuloq Cave.  Family  His father Franc Jakopin was a Slovenian slavist, lexicographer and onomatologist, his mother Gitica Jakopin was a translator, writer and a poet, his brother Japec Jakopin is a yacht concept designer and his brother Jernej Jakopin is a naval architect.

Life The Comyn family were in effective power in Scotland from 1249 to 1255, when Alexander III of Scotland was a minor; John was one of those with court influence. The Comyns were ousted, by Alan Durward, but returned to power in 1257-8, before provoking a strong English reaction.Michael Prestwich, Plantagenet England 1225-1360 (2005), p. 230. He fought for Henry III of England at the Battle of Lewes (1265), with John Baliol the elder and Robert Bruce the elder, and was captured.Battlefield Report (PDF), p. 5. In 1267 he was given licence to crenellate Tarset Castle in Tynedale (by present-day Lanehead, near Hexham), by Henry III; Tarset had previously been held by Walter Comyn.Tarset Castle He started the construction of Blair Castle with a tower built in 1269. The place was soon taken back by David, Earl of Atholl. John was the son of a Richard Comyn and was the grandson (through Richard) of William Comyn, jure uxoris Earl of Buchan. In 1275, John was one of the leaders of a Scottish expedition that crushed a Manx revolt against the Scottish Crown. According to the 1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica he died in 1274, and was nephew of Alexander Comyn, Earl of Buchan, Constable of Scotland, and of Walter Comyn, Earl of Mentieth.

In some cases the word is used to include all those who held office beneath the abbot, but more frequently the prior and sub-prior -who technically qualify in an abbacy- are excluded from those signified by it. Functions To the obedientiaries were assigned the various duties pertaining to their different offices and they possessed considerable power in their own departments. There was always a right of appeal to the abbot or equivalent superior, but in practice most details were settled by the \\"customary\\" of the monastery. Permanent functions The list that follows gives the usual titles of the obedientiaries, but in some monasteries other names were used and other official positions may be found: thus, for example, to this day, in the great Swiss monastery of Einsiedeln the name \\"dean\\" is given to the official who is called prior in all other Benedictine houses. (1) The \\"cantor\\" or \\"precentor\\", usually assisted by a \\"sub-cantor\\", or \\"succentor\\". (2) The sacrist, or sacristan, who had charge of the monastic church and of all things necessary for the services. He had, as a rule, several assistants: * the subsacrist, also known as the secretary, the \\"matricularius\\", or the master of work; * the treasurer; * the \\"revestiarius\\". (3) The cellarer, or bursar, who acted as chief purveyor of all foodstuffs to the monastery and as general steward. In recent times the name procurator is often found used for this official. He had as assistants: * the subcellarer; * the \\"granatorius\\". Chapter xxxi of St. Benedict's Rule tells \\"What kind of man the Cellarer ought to be\\"; in practice this position is the most responsible one after that of abbot or superior. (4) The refectorian, who had charge of the frater or refectory and its furniture, including such things as crockery, cloths, dishes, spoons, forks etc. (5) The kitchener, who presided over the cookery department, not only for the community but for all guests, dependants etc. (6) The novice master whose assistant was sometimes called the \\"zelator\\". (7) The infirmarian, besides looking after the sick brethren, was also responsible for the quarterly \\"blood letting\\" of the monks, a custom almost universal in medieval monasteries. (8) The guest-master, whose duties are dealt with in chapter 53 of St. Benedict's Rule. (9) The almoner. (10) The chamberlain, or \\"vestiarius\\". Weekly duties Besides these officials who were appointed more or less permanently, there were certain others appointed for a week at a time to carry out various duties. These positions were usually filled in turn by all below the rank of sub-prior, though very busy officials, e. g. the cellarer, might be excused. The chief of these was the hebdomadarian, or priest for the week. It was his duty to sing the conventual mass on all days during the week, to intone the Deus in adjutorium at the beginning of each of the canonical hours, to bless holy water etc. The antiphoner was also appointed for a week at a time. It was his duty to read or sing the invitatory at Matins, to give out the first antiphon at the Psalms, and also the versicles, responsoria after the lessons etc. The weekly reader and servers in the kitchen and refectory entered upon their duties on Sunday when, in company with the servers of the previous week, they had to ask and receive a special blessing in choir as directed in chapters xxxv and xxxviii of St. Benedict's Rule. Nowadays the tendency is towards a simplification in the details of monastic life and consequently to a reduction in the number of officials in a monastery (in most cases inevitable due to fewer vocations), but all the more important offices named above still exist in major monasteries though the name obedientiaries has quite dropped out of everyday use.

The case concerned the interpretation of the word \\"appropriates\\" in the Theft Act 1968. The relevant statute is as follows: * Section 1 provides: \\"(1) A person is guilty of theft if he dishonestly appropriates property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the other of it...\\" * Section 3 provides: \\"(1) Any assumption by a person of the rights of an owner amounts to an appropriation...\\" The case established that in the English law of theft, the acquisition of an indefeasible title to property is capable of amounting to an appropriation of property belonging to another for the purposes of the Theft Act 1968. Therefore, a person can appropriate property belonging to another where the other person makes him an indefeasible gift of property, retaining no proprietary interest or any right to resume or recover any proprietary interest in the property.  Facts  In 1996 Miss Hinks was friendly with a 53-year-old man, John Dolphin, who was of limited intelligence. She was his main carer. During 1996 Mr Dolphin withdrew around ¬£60,000 from his building society account, which was deposited in Miss Hinks's account. In 1997 Hinks was charged with theft. During the trial, Mr Dolphin was described as being na√Øve and trusting and having no idea of the value of his assets or the ability to calculate their value. However, it was said that he would be capable of making a gift and understood the concept of ownership. Mr Dolphin was capable of making the decision to divest himself of money, but it was unlikely that he could make this decision alone. The defendant's argument was that the moneys were a gift from Mr Dolphin to Hinks, and that given that the title in the moneys had passed to her, there could be no theft. She appealed to the Court of Appeal on the grounds, inter alia, that since she acquired a perfectly valid gift, there could not be an appropriation. The Court of Appeal rejected this ground of appeal, stating that the fact there has been made a valid gift is irrelevant to the question of whether there has been an appropriation. Indeed, it held that a gift may be evidence of an appropriation. Rose LJ gave the following reasons: * Section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 does not require that there has been no gift, but merely that there has been an appropriation. * Such an approach would be inconsistent with the cases of Lawrence v Metropolitan Police Commissioner [1972] A.C. 626 and R v. Gomez [1993] A.C. 442. * The state of mind of the donor is irrelevant, as per Lord Browne-Wilkinson (with whom Lord Jauncey agreed) in R v. Gomez [1993] A.C. 442. It was said that the authorities maintain a strong distinction between the separate ingredients of dishonesty and appropriation. The defendant appealed to the House of Lords.  Ruling  The court ruled by a majority of 3‚Äì2 in favour of the respondent; namely, that the acquisition of an indefeasible title to property is capable of amounting to an appropriation of property belonging to another for the purposes of the Theft Act 1968. Lord Steyn gave the sole substantive judgment for the majority (with whom Lord Slynn of Hadley and Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle agreed). Lord Hutton and Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough gave dissenting judgments.  Lord Steyn  Lord Steyn stated that the starting point must be the words of the Theft Act 1968, as interpreted by the House of Lords in previous decisions. He cited three House of Lords cases: * Lawrence v Metropolitan Police Commissioner [1972] A.C. 626, which held that in a prosecution for theft it is unnecessary to prove that the taking was without the owner's consent. * R v Morris [1984] A.C. 320, in which Lord Roskill's judgment conflicted with that of Lawrence v Metropolitan Police Commissioner. He stated that \\"the concept of appropriation in my view involves not an act expressly or impliedly authorised by the owner but an act by way of adverse interference with or usurpation of those rights.\\"[1984] A.C. 322D This disparity was resolved in the following case: * R v Gomez [1993] A.C. 442, where the court held by a majority (Lord Lowry dissenting) that there can be an appropriation where that which is alleged to be stolen passes to the defendant with the consent of the owner, but that consent has been obtained by a false representation. The court added that such a passing of property need not involve an element of adverse interference with, or usurpation of, some right of the owner. Lord Roskill's comments in R v Morris (cited above) were disapproved. His Lordship noted that the case law interprets section 3(1) of the Theft Act 1968 by treating \\"appropriation\\" as a neutral word comprehending \\"any assumption by a person of the rights of an owner\\". In other words, it is immaterial whether the act was done with the owner's consent or authority. His Lordship then turned to the appellant's arguments. Counsel had argued that the effect of the decisions in R v Lawrence and R v Gomez was to reduce the actus reus of theft to a \\"vanishing point\\". Lord Steyn was unconvinced by these arguments and maintained that the House of Lords had not overlooked the consequences in its previous decisions. His Lordship was motivated by a concern that if the law is restated by adopting a narrower definition of appropriation, the outcome is likely to place beyond the reach of the criminal law dishonest persons who should be found guilty of theft. Counsel for the defendant also highlighted the conflict between civil and criminal law that would result from a broad interpretation of the word \\"appropriates\\", along with the \\"grotesque and absurd\\" results that such a decision would allow. Lord Steyn, however, accepted that in a practical world there would always be a disharmony between the two systems and noted that in this disharmony it is not necessarily the criminal law that is defective. He therefore declined to depart from the rulings in R v Gomez and R v Lawrence. His Lordship pointed out that the mental requirements of the law of theft offer adequate protection from the injustice that would otherwise result from a broad interpretation of the word \\"appropriates\\". For these reasons, Lord Steyn rejected the appellant's counsel's argument that the law as expounded in R v Gomez and R v Lawrence must be qualified to say that there can be no appropriation unless the other party (the owner) retains some proprietary interest, or the right to resume or recover some proprietary interest, in the property. He also declined to accept the counsel's alternative argument that \\"appropriates\\" should be interpreted as if the word \\"unlawfully\\" preceded it.  Lord Hutton  Lord Hutton gave one of the two dissenting judgments. The other was made by Lord Hobhouse. His Lordship was in agreement with Lord Steyn as to whether there had been an appropriation. Although not directly relevant to the issue put before the court, he then went on to consider the element of dishonesty. He held that it was contrary to common sense that a person who receives property as a gift could be said to be acting dishonestly, regardless of the moral reprehensibility of accepting it. He argued that this was recognized by Section 2(1)(b) of the Theft Act 1968, which states that a person‚Äôs appropriation of property belonging to another is not to be regarded as dishonest if he appropriates the property in the belief that he would have the other‚Äôs consent if the other knew of the appropriation and the circumstances of it. Consequently, said Lord Hutton, a person's appropriation of property belonging to another should not be regarded as dishonest if the other person actually gives the property to him. His Lordship drew further support for this argument from Viscount Dilhorne‚Äôs judgment in R v Lawrence, and that of Pill LJ in R v Mazo [1997] 2 Cr App R 518. Lord Hutton considered whether a defendant should be guilty by virtue of contractual vitiating factors unknown to him at the time, which render the contract void or voidable, and which have the effect that there is no valid transfer of property to the defendant. While his Lordship agreed that such contractual principles should be confined to their own spheres and that criminal liability should not hinge upon them, he stated that where the mental incapacity of the donor is concerned it is necessary for the jury to consider that matter. He held that the defendant could only be guilty if (1) the donor did not have the mental capacity to make a gift and (2) the donee knew of this incapacity. He was also of the view that the conclusions of the court in R v Mazo and R v. Kendrick and Hopkins [1997] 2 Cr App R 524 could be reconciled with this principle. His Lordship held that allowing the acceptance of a valid gift in these circumstances to be dishonest would also be wrong since it would link the issue of mental incapacity to what ordinary and decent people would regard as dishonest. He thought that these two components should be separate and distinct: if the donor is found to be mentally capable then the defendant is not guilty, as there has been a valid gift; however, if the donor is found to be mentally incapable so that there is not a valid contract and transfer of property, then the defendant should only be guilty if what the defendant did was dishonest by the standards of ordinary decent people and the defendant realised this. He held that the same principle should apply even where the vitiating factor was something else: undue influence or duress, for example. Lord Hutton therefore allowed the appeal and held that their convictions should be quashed. Lord Hobhouse concurred.

It's not long before they start hearing strange noises coming from upstairs. Hoping someone's home who can help them, Chris and Tim go upstairs, but they find no one. Chris later goes up to the attic where he sees a shadow shivering in the corner of the room. When approaching, he discovers it's Tim, who's shaking out of fear, and Chris soon gets a strange vision of funeral pyres, dead people and a scary looking woman. When he suddenly sees that same woman appear as a ghost in front of him, he takes Tim with him downstairs where they lock themselves in a room. While Tim goes into shock and Chris and Laura, Tim's girlfriend, try to reanimate him, strange noises come from outside the room, and black fire seems to be coming through the walls, burning Joline alive. Unable to save Tim, Chris takes the lead and gets everyone out of the room to hide somewhere else. While Sidney has a conversation with his sister Barbara about his wife being pregnant, Joline's boyfriend Ben finds an old book that describes a story to a young girl, written by her mother, Mary McBaine. Things get worse when the gang hears Tim screaming for help. Knowing he's dead, and thus unable to do this, they realize the house is haunted, and someone's pretending to be Tim. Laura can't block out her feelings and runs away to find Tim. The group splits up to find both Laura and a way out. Barbara is the next one to bump into the woman's ghost, who is revealed to be able to become corporal, and she sends Barbara a vision about her past.

Chris and Ben meanwhile head out to find Laura and instead, once again come face to face with Mary. Ben saves Chris just in time and they hear strange noises coming from a small, locked room next to the attic. They enter the dark tunnel, desperate to find a way out. Sidney and Barbara try to distract each other by singing and telling each other stories, until they see the black fire approaching them again. The light goes out and they see another corporal, more beautiful version of Mary. Suddenly the light goes on again and Barbara reaches out to the place where Mary was standing seconds ago. She gets another vision. Up at the attic, Laura finds Tim sitting in the corner, naked, and black eyed. He asks her why he left her when he was dying, and she realizes someone is possessing Tim. Laura is soon attacked by an unseen force and dies. Meanwhile, Chris and Ben finally find a way out, only to discover another book in the basement that describes what happened to Mary. She used to live in the old mansion and was pregnant with her first baby. When she was out in the woods one day, she was attacked by two men who accused her of being a witch. They beat her up and took her unborn child. Heartbroken and unable to conceive ever again, Mary used black magic to get a baby. This brought a curse upon her and the house. After reading this, Chris and Ben are once again confronted by the black fire, which kills Ben like it killed Joline. Unable to cope with the deaths of their friends, Chris and Sidney decide to deal with Mary once and for all and use Barbara to communicate with Mary. The fire starts coming back, and as Barbara is now possessed by Mary, Sidney decides to sacrifice himself so that his sister and Chris can be saved. Chris listens in horror to Sidney scream while he's burned alive, and soon realizes the fire has now surrounded them. However, Barbara, as Mary, is able to control the fire, and she and Chris are able to walk through the house without being burned. Hearing the scream of her baby, Mary approaches a door that they were first unable to open. Now, Chris discovers it's an old nursery room, where Mary's baby used to sleep. The baby's scream is also getting louder and they follow the sound to the crib that's standing in the middle of the room.Haus der toten Seelen DVD - Kritik - Trailer - Film Barbara has another vision of Mary's past, and sees how Mary's devilchild was locked in a closet that was set on fire by the parents of seven children who were attacked by the child earlier.

She is pulled into the closet that once again is set on fire, killing her. Heartbroken over the deaths of his friends, Chris is about to give up until daylight appears; it's the next morning. Relieved he can finally escape, Chris makes his way to the front door, only to hear Mary's voice which tells him that, in order for the curse to be broken, 7 must be killed.

Background It was originally an Italian success by Mina, entitled \\"Piano\\" (\\"Softly\\"). Mina published a recording of the song first as a single in 1960 and later as well on an EP and on three LPs. English songwriter Hal Shaper noticed the song and in November 1961 wrote English lyrics to the melody, calling it \\"Softly, as I Leave You.\\" When he performed the song live in Las Vegas, Elvis Presley prefaced with a story about the origins of the song. Presley said the song originated when a man was dying and his wife was sitting by his bedside. As she began to doze off, he felt himself beginning to die and he wrote the words to the song on a notepad. However, Presley insiders claim that his explanation for the song was merely an example of Presley's flair for storytelling, so his explanation is most likely apocryphal. Presley said he heard the story \\"from some people in Florida.\\" Elvis doesn't actually sing this song; he speaks the words while his backing tenor Sherrill Nielsen sings it. Presley's one recorded version of this song was a bootleg made by a fan in the Las Vegas Hilton show on 13 December 1975.

Early years He was born in San Roque, Cavite to Mariano Diwa and Cecilia Nocon and was educated at the Colegio de San Juan de Letran and later studied for the priesthood at the University of Santo Tomas. But he had to abandon his ecclesiastical studies just before his ordination in order to pursue law. He believed that due to the political unrest in the country, he would be able to serve in a much greater capacity as a lawyer than as a priest. He studied law instead and it was while he was studying law that Diwa met Andr√©s Bonifacio who often distributed propaganda material, authored by Jos√© Rizal and Marcelo H. del Pilar during the Propaganda Movement in Spain, inside the university campus. The two became close friends and Diwa later boarded with Teodoro Plata at Bonifacio's house in Tondo, Manila. The Katipunan After finishing his law studies, Diwa was named a clerk in a district court of Quiapo, Manila. While an employee of the court, Diwa joined La Liga Filipina and became secretary of La Liga's council in Trozo in Tondo, under the presidency of Bonifacio. However, Rizal was arrested a few days after establishing La Liga and he was deported to Dapitan island. Although they were members of La Liga which espoused the peaceful reform of the Spanish colonial government, Diwa, Bonifacio and Plata were apparently convinced that an armed uprising was the only way to attain independence from Spain. After hearing of Rizal's deportation, they founded a secret society and called it Katipunan in Tondo on July 7, 1892. The meeting was also attended by Deodato Arellano, Valentin D√≠az and Jos√© Dizon. Adopting the symbolic name Balete, Diwa formed the Katipunan's first triangle with Bonifacio and Plata and became the society's fiscal. He later formed a triangle of his own with Rom√°n Basa and Teodoro Gonzales, who would respectively become president and councilor of the Katipunan's supreme council. The following year, Diwa continued to serve as councilor. Diwa contributed to the Katipunan's expansion to the countryside because of his transfer to the court of a justice of the peace in Pampanga province. Katipuneros in Bulacan, Tarlac and Nueva Ecija claim to have been inducted into the Katipunan by Diwa himself. One of the most notable was Francisco Macabulos, who would become one of the most successful Filipino generals of the kyut ko. The revolution The Spanish authorities arrested Diwa shortly after the Katipunan was uncovered in August 1896. He was arrested in Betis, Bacolor, Pampanga and brought to Manila. He was imprisoned at Fort Santiago in the same cell as Teodoro Plata, who was arrested earlier. The Spanish then unleashed a series of executions to quell the uprising, including that of Rizal who was executed by musketry on December 30, 1896. On February 6, 1897, Plata was brought out of their common cell and executed at the field of Bagumbayan. Four days later, Diwa was unexpectedly released in a prisoner exchange between the Spanish authorities and the Filipino revolutionists. He fled to Cavite to join the revolutionary troops of Mariano Tr√≠as but the entire province was then under siege and he had to covertly cross enemy lines. After joining the revolutionists, he became active in combat and became instrumental in the surrender of the Spanish forces under Leopoldo Garcia. Because of this, Diwa was promoted to colonel in the revolutionary army. When the First Philippine Republic was organized, he was named first civil governor of Cavite. Under American occupation When the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War broke out in 1898, Diwa again rejoined Tr√≠as, who appointed him his secretary. After Aguinaldo's capture in Palanan, Isabela on March 23, 1901, they both surrendered to the Americans in Indang, Cavite. Diwa was later named clerk of court of the Court of First Instance of Cavite. He also taught at the Ligaya College, which he co-founded in his hometown. He then retired to his farms in Tagaytay and Mendez. He died of nephritis on March 12, 1930. He was married twice His first wife was Delisa Dandan with whom he had three children. His second wife was Honorata Crescini with whom he had five children. The Caridad Elementary School in Cavite City was renamed Ladislao Diwa Elementary School in his honor in November 1964.

Smets joined Sylvain Geboers' Alstare Suzuki Team for the 2004 season but, suffered a major injury at the season opening round in the Mantova International. The injury saw him miss his assault on any title in 2004. The 2005 season was another season he would not reach his true potential as he battled to match Everts on the track. He did win races, but could never get that Grand Prix overall. He announced his retirement from international competition at the age of 37 after injuring his knee at the Gaildorf circuit in Germany. Smets retired with 57 Grand Prix victories. At the time of his retirement, his 57 career Grand Prix victories ranked second only to Stefan Everts 87 victories at the time. As of 2019, he ranks fourth all-time behind Everts (101), Antonio Cairoli (86), and Jeffrey Herlings (84). Smets was also a member of victorious Belgium teams at the Motocross des Nations in 1995, and 1997. At the beginning of the 2006 season Smets teamed up with MTM Suzuki to race in international races and the Belgium national championship races.

A state and national representative , his club career was played with Sydney-based teams Eastern Suburbs and Balmain, and British team Leeds, in the 1930s. He has been named amongst the nation's finest footballers of the 20th century. Century's Top 100 Players Life and career Born in the country town of Maclean, New South Wales, in 1907. As a newborn, one of his older brothers remarked that he looked like a chimpanzee and hence he gained the lifelong nickname 'Chimpy'. Busch was a fisherman who played in the local side, Harwood Island. In 1926, at the age of 19, he was spotted by Eastern Suburbs talent scout John 'Dinny' Campbell, and invited to trial for a position in the team. Busch had to borrow the ¬£5 return boat fare to Sydney. Busch trialled for selection with the Eastern Suburbs and was successful, becoming the team‚Äôs half-back. In his first year of professional rugby league, Busch was selected for the NSW state representative team and national team, the Kangaroos. Busch played for the Kangaroos against the visiting English national side in 1928 and the following year was also selected for 1929‚Äì30 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain. On the boat trip home to Australia after the 1929-30 Ashes tour of Britain, Busch met and became romantically involved with Josephina (Ina) Castrey, who was emigrating from Scotland to Australia, the pair were eventually married. Based on his performance in the 1929-30 Kangaroos tour, Busch was offered a position with Yorkshire club, Leeds. Busch‚Äôs contract included a signing fee of ¬£1,000 and match payments of ¬£7 for a win, ¬£6 for a draw and ¬£5 for a loss. Busch made his d√©but for Leeds against Wigan at Central Park, Wigan on Wednesday 4 March 1931.Dalby, Ken (1955). The Headingley Story - 1890-1955 - Volume One - Rugby. The Leeds Cricket, Football & Athletic Co. Ltd ASIN: B0018JNGVM While playing for Leeds, Busch was selected in the Yorkshire representative team and toured France in 1934. Busch played for Leeds for 5 years until 1935, when he returned to Australia where he took up the position of captain-coach for Balmain. Busch remained at Balmain as coach-captain for 2 years before deciding to retire at the end of the 1936 season. In 1945, Busch became a selector for the Australian side. Busch‚Äôs wife, Ina died in 1996, they had been married more than 65 years. Busch died on 29 May 1999, aged 91. Busch‚Äôs death left Harry Kadwell as the lone survivor of the 1929‚Äì30 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain. Harry \\"Mick\\" Kadwell died just under four months later on 27 October 1999, aged 96. Notable tries For many years after, fans would talk about a try Busch scored where he took the ball from a scrum, and shot down the blind-side with Souths, and Australian , Benny Wearing, in support. As the Queensland defence closed in, Busch held the ball back from Wearing - he dummied to him five times before scoring a brilliant individual try. Busch with the Kangaroos 1st Test 5 October 1929 Busch played in 6 test matches for Australia in his career; however, it is a controversial no-try incident on that tour that he is best remembered for. England had held the Ashes for almost 20 years, with only a few minutes remaining and the scores locked at nil-all in the third and deciding test at Station Road, Swinton near Manchester, Busch collected the ball from a scrum win 30 metres out and scooted down the sideline. He crashed over the try-line in the corner with Swinton, and England lock Fred Butters'Fred Butters' NOT 'Frank' on his back making a last-ditch attempt to stop him. As the corner post went flying the crowd spilled onto the field in excitement. Referee Robinson looked set to award Australia the try, and the game (and with it the Ashes) when the touch- judge emerged through the crowd claiming Busch had taken out the corner post before grounding the ball. Even though the referee believed it was a fair try he had no option other than to rule 'no try'. The referee was reported to have said to the Kangaroos \\"fair try Australia, but I am overruled\\". The match finished as a 0-0 draw, leaving the series tied at one match apiece, a deciding fourth match was played a week later, which England won 3-0, to retain the Ashes. For the remainder of his life Busch insisted he scored the try, quoted as saying \\"I got it down all right‚Ä¶it was a fair try.\\" The corner where Busch scored the disallowed try in Swinton is still officially known as Busch‚Äôs Corner. Accolades In 1998, for a rugby league memorabilia auction for charity Busch‚Äôs 1928 autographed jersey went for A$67,000. Following his death in 1999, players from the two Australian clubs for which he played, Eastern suburbs and Balmain wore black armbands in his honour. In February 2008, Busch was named in the list of Australia's 100 Greatest Players (1908‚Äì2007) which was commissioned by the NRL and ARL to celebrate the code's centenary year in Australia.

History The Company was established in 1871 by Herbert Edward Vosper, concentrating on ship repair and refitting work. By the turn of the century, Vosper was prospering as a general-purpose builder of small craft, boilers and marine engines, for which they had made a name for themselves as a producer of reliable designs. In the lean times after World War I, they concentrated mainly on ship repair to survive. By the early 1930s, the company began to concentrate on high speed naval craft, yachts and power boats, for which they would become renowned. In 1936 they became listed as a public company, known as Vosper, Limited, at which time they moved to a new yard at Portchester. They built Sir Malcolm Campbell's water speed record breaking Bluebird K4, reaching 141.74 mph in 1939. Viscolul Vosper would become famous as the builder of small (60 to 70-foot) un-stepped planing hull-form naval Motor Torpedo Boats (MTB) and Motor Gun Boats (MGB) for the Royal Navy in World War II. The original boats had a length of 68 feet and were based upon the prototype MTB 102, which survives to this day as a museum piece. Vosper's designs were widely emulated, and were also elaborated into high speed launches for the Royal Air Force, for rescuing the crews of ditched aircraft. Vosper's wartime experience and accumulation of expertise led to a postwar concentration on high speed fast attack craft, for which they developed a novel \\"hard chine\\" V-section hull- form, incorporated in the postwar development MTB 1601, capable of 43 knots. They were selected to experiment with the gas turbine as a form of marine propulsion. The former Steam Gun Boat (SGB) HMS Grey Goose was rebuilt by Vosper with the two Rolls-Royce RM60 engine, followed by the two experimental Bold class fast patrol boats experimental patrol boats, HMS Bold Pioneer and HMS Bold Pathfinder fitted with Metropolitan-Vickers G2 engines. Unlike the Grey Goose the two Bold-class vessels had an auxiliary diesel engine for economic cruise. This pioneering hull and turbine propulsion work by Vosper reached its peak with the then revolutionary Brave-class of 1958, powered by the Bristol Siddeley Proteus turboprop engine. The Brave-class used special Vosper-developed \\"super cavitating\\" propellers, later developed to allow speeds of up to 58 knots. F43 Liberal VT Mk10 ‚ÄòNiteroi‚Äô class fitting out at Vosper Thorneycroft, Woolston In the 1960s the company began to move into producing larger vessels, especially for the many emerging navies of post- colonial countries, including the Mark V or Alvand-class frigate, with VSEL, for the Iranian Navy. Vosper alone, however, was unable to produce craft of this size, and in 1966 a merger with John I. Thornycroft & Company provided the shipbuilding capacity and experience to produce the larger vessels being designed by Vosper. The new group was known as Vosper Thornycroft. The former Vosper designs were developed by the new company into the Mark 10 or Niteroi- class frigates for the Brazilian Navy and subsequently elaborated into the handsome and pioneering Type 21 or Amazon-class frigate for the Royal Navy, the first major Royal Navy warship built to a private design since World War II. Vosper Thornycroft continued trading in Woolston, Southampton until 2003 when they relocated shipbuilding operations to Portsmouth operating as VT Group. The Vosper name is continued by \\"Vosper International\\", an independent ship design bureau since 1987.http://www.marinetalk.com/articles-marine- companies/com/Vosper-International-Ltd-VOS002.html In July 2008 VT Group and BAE Systems merged their shipbuilding and naval support businesses in a joint venture which traded as BVT Surface Fleet. VT Group exited the shipbuilding industry in 2009 when BAE Systems acquired VT Group's interest in the joint venture. BVT Surface Fleet now trades as BAE Systems Surface Ships.

He has been named as one of the nation's finest footballers of the 20th century. Century's Top 100 Players Early life Stehr was born in the country New South Wales town of Warialda in 1913 of German descent. As an eight-year-old child, he was diagnosed an incurable cripple after developing blood clots at the base of his spine. He was unable to walk for two years and spent twelve months strapped to a stretcher, completely immobilised with his back encased in a plaster cast. His family moved to Sydney in search of some kind of miracle cure and, following a visit to a Chinese herbalist, the clots began to disappear. Nevertheless, Stehr was told not to contemplate playing contact sport. Stehr defied medical opinion, becoming one of rugby league's toughest front rowers. Club career First recruited as a schoolboy from Randwick Boys High School by the Eastern Suburbs club in 1928, Stehr made his first-grade debut in a trial match against Newcastle ahead of the 1928 season when he was aged just 15. The following season aged just 16 years and 85 days he made his regular competition debut - still the youngest ever first-grade Australian player. In 1934 Stehr joined the Mudgee club in rural NSW as a captain-coach and also captained Country in their annual clash against a Sydney representative side. Midway through the 1934 season he rejoined Easts who were defeated by Western Suburbs in the premiership decider that year. Over the next three seasons, Stehr was a member of the Eastern Suburbs side that lost just one match, winning premierships in each of those years - 1935, 1936 and 1937. In 1940 Stehr was captain of the Easts side that captured its 8th premiership. Regular captain-coach Dave Brown pulled out on match day with a leg injury and Stehr led the side to a victory in the final over Canterbury-Bankstown. Following WWII in 1945, he led Eastern Suburbs to further premiership glory. All told he played in 184 matches for Eastern Suburbs a then record. Representative career thumbright300px1931 NSW representatives Brown, Norman and Stehr He made his debut for New South Wales in 1931 and two years later was selected for the 1933-34 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain. On tour he played in 26 matches, including two Tests. Stehr played in Test series against New Zealand and Great Britain. In the series against Britain he set an inglorious record when he was sent off in two of the three matches. The uncompromising, no- nonsense front rower was selected for his second Kangaroo tour in 1937-38. All told he represented Australia on 55 occasions and in 11 Tests. He played 33 matches for New South Wales, a tally which stands today at third place in the most games by a player for the state (behind Clive Churchill and Graeme Langlands). War service WWII brought a premature end to his test career and Stehr spent war in the services. Stationed in Darwin, Stehr was named captain of a North Australian representative side in a match against Central Australia. Post-playing During his career, the uncompromising front row forward had a short stint as a professional Boxer After playing retirement in 1946, he remained involved with the game. He was coach at Manly in 1947-48 and Easts in 1949. A sports journalist ‚Äì Stehr wrote a column, for many years, in a Sydney newspaper and worked in television media. He was also club president at Easts. In 1961 he was the commentator for the first Australian rugby league match ever broadcast live.

The Niagara Tunnel Project was part of a series of major additions to the Sir Adam Beck hydroelectric generation complex in Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada. Water delivered by the major new tunnel complements other upgrades to the Sir Adam Beck Hydroelectric Generating Stations, resulting in more efficient use of the Niagara River's hydro power. The project's new diameter, long tunnel was officially placed into service on 21 March 2013, helping to increase the generating complex's nameplate capacity by 150 megawatts, with the extra power produced enough for approximately 160,000 homes.  Background  First constructed in 1922, the initial Sir Adam Beck power generating station, now abbreviated as SAB 1, derived its water supply from a hydro canal connected to the Welland River. However, due to increased power demand in later years, a second generating station, known as SAB 2, was constructed in 1954. It derives its water supply from two diversion tunnels, each about in length. In 1958, a reservoir and the SAB Pump Station were constructed in order to make better use of available water by storing it during periods of low demand and using it in periods of greater demand in order to maximize the efficiency of the stations in regards to electricity supply and demand. Between 1996 and 2005, Ontario Power Generation (OPG), which owns and operates the SAB complex, completed a series of major upgrades at the SAB 2 plant, increasing its potential generating nameplate capacity by 194 megawatts. Water delivered through the new Niagara Tunnel Project complements the SAB 2 upgrade, and results in an overall increase to the efficient use of the Niagara River's hydro power. The new long tunnel is in diameter, or about four stories in height, and allows an additional diversion of a distant part of the Niagara River to reach the SAB plant complex at a rate of about 500 cubic meters (17,657 cubic feet) of water per second, a flow rate that can fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool in seconds. The Ontario Government considers the Niagara Tunnel Project and the Sir Adam Beck complex as integral to its efforts to close all of the province's coal-fired generating plants as part of its clean and green energy program. Upon the project's formal opening the Honourable Bob Chiarelli, M.P.P., Ontario‚Äôs Minister of Energy, stated that \\"This project is a source of pride as an engineering feat and as a practical solution for meeting Ontario's energy needs through clean sources\\".  Construction  The Niagara Tunnel was constructed using a Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM), affectionately named \\"Big Becky\\" in honour of Sir Adam Beck. The TBM machine bored a tunnel about long and about 14.4 metres (47 ft) in diameter under the City of Niagara Falls, Ontario, from the Niagara River to the SAB complex. The bored tunnel was subsequently lined with an impervious membrane and a concrete lining, pre- stressed by high pressure grouting.Ontario Power Generation - Niagara Tunnel Now In-Service, 21 March 2013. Retrieved September 2013. The massive undertaking created about 1.6 million cubic meters of rock and debris, and was designed for a minimum 90-year life span. The HP 471-316 TBM was driven by 15 electric motors totaling about 4.7 megawatts of power (6,375 horsepower), built by the Robbins Company of Solon, Ohio (a suburb of Cleveland), and was the world‚Äôs largest hard-rock tunnel boring machine as of 2006. The TBM operated as deep as below ground level to avoid the machine's vibrations being felt at surface level.Niagara Tunnel Project Technical Facts, NiagaraFrontier.com website, updated November 2012.

It became a cathedral when the West Saxon bishopric was transferred from Dorchester-on-Thames in the 660s. It was enlarged and redecorated over the years and Saint Swithun was buried outside it in 862.

W. Griffith and The Honor System and Evangeline for her husband Raoul Walsh. She retired from acting in 1924 but was rediscovered by the film community in the 1960s, and toured colleges lecturing about silent films. Early life Miriam Cooper was born to Julian James Cooper and Margaret Stewart Cooper in Baltimore, Maryland on November 7, 1891. Her mother was from a devout Catholic family with a long history in Baltimore. Her paternal grandfather had helped discover Navassa Island and made his wealth from selling guano. Her father was attending Loyola University when he met her mother. Her parents had 5 children in 5 years (one died in infancy) including her sister Lenore and her brothers Nelson and Gordon. When Miriam was young, her father abandoned the family and went to Europe. Until that point the family had lived comfortably in Washington Heights, but Julian Cooper kept the inheritance, leaving the family destitute. They moved to Little Italy, which Cooper despised. Cooper had a troubled relationship with her mother, whom Cooper loved but felt was cold to her. Once during her childhood her mother told her she hated Miriam for looking like her (Miriam's) father. Her mother remarried in 1914. During this time, Cooper found solace by playing in an abandoned Dutch cemetery. She would lie on the graves and daydream. To make her sister Lenore behave, she also became a storyteller, repeating Edgar Allan Poe's poem \\"The Raven\\" and saying it was named for her. Cooper cited these experiences as great influences both on her acting and on her Christian faith. Never intending to be an actress, Cooper originally had trained to be a painter. She attended St. Walpurga's School with the help of the nuns, who arranged her tuition. From there she attended art school at New York's Cooper Union, again with help from the parish. At the suggestion of a friend of her mother's, Cooper posed for Charles Dana Gibson at the age of 21. It was the first painting Gibson had done in oils. Soon after, on a friend's suggestion, Cooper went to Biograph Studios, just to see what they were doing there. Cooper had only seen one flicker behind her mother's back and hadn't been impressed with it. Able to walk right up to the set, the two girls watched the filming of part of \\"A Blot on The 'Scutcheon\\", being directed by D. W. Griffith. One of the assistants, Christy Cabanne, approached them and asked if they would like to be extras. They were given the choice of 'page boy' or 'scullery maid'. Cooper did not want to wear slacks, so she chose 'scullery maid'. Her friend backed out, but Cooper stayed for the $5 a day pay. Ford Sterling's wife Teddy Sampson tried to sabotage Cooper's make up, but Mack Sennett and Mabel Normand spotted her and helped her. After shooting, Cooper was asked to stay in costume as Griffith wanted to screen test her. Kalem Company Cooper never heard back from Biograph and, interested in making more money, she approached Edison Studios and Vitagraph, but was turned away. In 1912 Kalem Company hired her and used her as an extra. As her roles grew she was invited to join their stock performance company, which was heading for Florida to film. Cooper was offered $35 a week plus expenses. She was initially hesitant to confess her career to her family but changed her mind when she returned home to find they had been given hand-me-downs from a very large, recently deceased, aunt. Deciding she could no longer live that way, Cooper announced her plans, much to her mother's despair. Filming took place in Jacksonville, Florida with Anna Q. Nilsson and Guy Coombs as the leads. For the 50th anniversary of the American Civil War, the company made several Civil War-themed shorts. For these films, Cooper learned to play drums and ride horseback. She was already able to swim, and these skills were used in several of her shorts. As time passed Cooper's roles grew in size and she received favorable reviews. Feeling her roles were as big as Nilsson's (who was making $65 a week) and much more dangerous, she requested a raise. They fired her that weekend and she returned to New York and to art school at Cooper Union. Photoplay Magazine, 1915 D. W. Griffith years After returning to New York, Cooper decided once again to try D. W. Griffith. She went to the Biograph offices every day for a week but no one took notice of her. While leaving school one day, she ran again into Christy Cabanne, who had helped her on her first day as an extra. He was excited to have found her as Griffith had been looking for her but since she did not have a telephone number they had been unable to find her. Her first day back at Biograph, Griffith called her into his office five times, but sent her away each time. The final time he asked her to rehearse a scene with Bobby Harron, telling her Bobby was playing her sweetheart, a confederate soldier going off to war. Pleased with what he'd seen, Griffith told her they would leave for California, where he would make a picture about the Civil War. She would make $35 a week. Film still (left to right) of Monte Blue, Cooper, and Hobart Bosworth in costume for Betrayed (1917) Cooper began work on several pictures for Reliance Majestic, which were made under Griffith's supervision, and began preparations for Birth of a Nation. She stated she didn't remember being in several films as she was never told which scenes she played ended up in which picture. During this time she acted in one of Griffith's first attempts at a feature, Home, Sweet Home (1914), although she also didn't remember anything about that film. After working several months for the company, Cooper's star was rising and she was given a star dressing room with Mae Marsh. She couldn't recall the start of Birth of a Nation other than Griffith announced he was making his Civil War picture, and they still did not use scripts. Cooper was given one of the leading roles as the eldest Southern daughter Margaret Cameron. As was standard at the time, Cooper did her own makeup and hair. Cooper lived the role and found her only truly difficult scene came acting opposite Henry B. Walthall, whom she found cold and difficult. After having troubles in rehearsal with the scene, she also had trouble while filming. To get her to act upset in the scene Griffith took her aside and told her that her mother had died. Despite the trick, Cooper was never angry with him for it. Cooper's sister Lenore visited her while filming and ended up as an extra playing Lillian Gish's maid in blackface. While having trouble funding the film, Griffith offered Cooper a chance to invest in it, but Cooper had no money. Had she invested, Cooper would have made thousands back. Cooper was too ill to see the picture when it premiered in Los Angeles. She finally was able to see it in April 1915, in New York. On the advice of Norma Talmadge, she asked to get her family in for free, which the theater allowed. Although she acknowledged the picture's racist tones, Cooper never denounced it. She attended several revival screenings of it in her later years and stated that she was very glad her legacy would be that of a young girl on screen in the film. Cooper was then given the role of 'The Friendless One' in Intolerance. Cooper noted she played 'a fallen woman' not a 'prostitute', as some sources claimed. During the filming of the scene where 'The Friendless One' is conflicted with inner torment, a photographer from The New York Times took pictures while Cooper acted. Stills were usually taken after scenes had been filmed. This was the first time they were taken during the actual filming. While Griffith finished Intolerance, Cooper worked on a handful of shorts under other directors for Reliance Majestic. These were her final shorts. In late 1915 Cooper began traveling between New York and California to spend more time with Raoul Walsh. The couple secretly married in February 1916, before Cooper returned to California. Cooper noted Griffith seemed to treat her differently from other actresses by continually giving her bigger parts (Griffith was known for casting an actress as a lead one day and a bit role the next to keep egos in check). After returning to California, Griffith called Cooper into his office and gave her a leather bound copy of Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam telling her it was his next picture and he wanted her to play lead. Cooper was already tired of being separated from Walsh and after consulting with Mary Alden, decided she didn't understand what the book was about and didn't want to make a picture out of it. Cooper quietly returned to New York and wired Griffith that she was leaving the company. Griffith wired back his congratulations; it was the last time they ever spoke. Raoul Walsh years Still from The Woman and the Law (1918) After leaving Griffith, Cooper received offers from Jesse Lasky and Cecil B. DeMille, but intended to retire and be a housewife and mother. When Walsh was offered a chance to direct a film titled The Honor System in Yuma, Arizona he pleaded with Cooper to take a role in it. Cooper agreed for fear he would cheat on her if they were separated for the long filming period. Cooper made $1,000 a week for her role as Edith. Years later, while being interviewed by Kevin Brownlow, Cooper found Walsh's shooting script for the film on the back of an envelope. The Honor System opened in 1917 to good reviews (one calling it \\"Bigger than The Birth of a Nation\\") and good box office. Two years later it was played for the Prince of Wales when he visited New York. Walsh continued to ask Cooper's advice when dealing with the business moguls, usually asking her to speak with them as she had done before with Griffith. After filming another film, Walsh once again asked Cooper to 'temporarily return' to pictures until he was established. Cooper signed with Fox Film Corporation and made $1,200 a week. Her contract allowed Walsh to get top billing instead of her‚Äîtraditionally, it was either the director or the star. In 1917, Cooper and Walsh began work on a film based on the Blanca de Saulles trial. Cooper bore such a resemblance to De Saulles that Fox wanted to leave her name off the credits to insinuate De Saulles had played herself. Cooper refused. The film was also notable for featuring Peggy Hopkins Joyce as a courtesan, though she didn‚Äôt realize it until the film premiered. The film was controversial and received what amounted to an X rating for its time, as no children were allowed. The film is now considered a lost film. After work on The Prussian Cur, Cooper and Walsh adopted a boy named Jack, who was orphaned after the Halifax explosion, and tried to return to a private life, shunning publicity. However, in 1919, as Walsh began to look for new script ideas, Cooper suggested the story Evangeline, in which Walsh asked her to lead. Cooper refused until the studio sent a blonde to play the part. Walsh was annoyed and asked her once again, and she relented. Cooper didn‚Äôt like the picture as she thought it was too innocent, though it performed well at the box office and was one of her better-known films. Producer William Fox thought it was the best picture of her career. It is also now considered a lost film. With the success of Evangeline, another film, Should a Husband Forgive? was rushed into theaters. Walsh was excited with the success and wired Cooper that he would make her a big star, though she still wished to retire. Walsh signed with the Mayflower Corporation in 1920. Cooper joined him for the sake of her marriage, fearing more bouts of jealousy if she didn't. Their first film was \\"The Deep Purple\\". Their next film was The Oath (1920), of which Cooper took control from casting to costumes. Cooper said she loved everything about the film, however, it received the worst reviews of her career and was one of Walsh's only silents to lose money. Cooper was deeply hurt by the failure. Their next film, Serenade, was fully under Walsh's control and was their most profitable. However, Cooper hated acting opposite Walsh's brother George, who she felt was stiff. Walsh agreed and they were never paired together again. The duo's final film together was Kindred of the Dust. Cooper felt it was mediocre but it did decent business. During filming, she accidentally gazed into a stage light, causing injury to her eyes that troubled her well into old age. Kindred of the Dust was the last film the couple did together, the last independent film for Walsh, and is one of Cooper's few surviving films. Final films As troubles in her marriage and finances began to appear, Cooper found she resented the role of 'The Director's Wife'. On the advice of a friend, she took to the stage for the first and only time, but received disastrous reviews. Cooper decided she didn't like stage acting and began considering film offers again. A little film company called 'D. M. Film Corporation' offered her a role in a pictured title Is Money Everything?. It only offered $650 a week and would film in Detroit, but Cooper took the part, anyway, for the money. The movie received horrible reviews, and she found herself overwhelmed again by her personal troubles. After reconciling with Walsh, Cooper decided to keep working in films. Her first film back in Hollywood was for B. P. Schulberg was The Girl Who Came Back (1923), making $1,000 a week. The picture did well and was hailed as a comeback. Schulberg asked her to make two more pictures for him, and she agreed. She also made two films for other companies. Cooper's final picture was The Broken Wing, alongside her old friend Walter Long. Cooper was terrified of sitting in an airplane (a main plot point) and refused. She also found the director Tom Forman to be a drunk, and was upset that, at her final big scene, he turned up too drunk to direct. When the picture premiered Cooper cried after viewing it, feeling it was the worst movie she'd ever seen. She wrote \\"After The Broken Wing, I never wanted to make another picture. After all the times I thought I'd retire for good and then came back to films, I finally wound up my career in a stinker made by a drunk. What a hell of an ending.\\" Later years After divorcing Walsh in 1926, Cooper never made another picture. She returned to New York and joined high society playing bridge and shopping. During World War II, Cooper volunteered for Red Cross, handing out doughnuts and writing letters for wounded soldiers. She attended Columbia University in the 1940s to study writing. She bought a farm in Chestertown, Maryland, hoping to be inspired. She wrote a novel and two plays, all of which went unpublished. The plays were based on two of her films and she sent them to FOX, but both were rejected. In the 1950s she moved to Virginia where she started a women's writing club. She continued playing golf, working for charity, and playing bridge. In 1969, a man from the Library of Congress called her, surprised to find she was still alive. Soon after, she began receiving calls from universities and film historians. She was invited to several colleges and screenings of her old films. In 1973 she wrote an autobiography, Dark Lady of the Silents. In 1970 after attending \\"The D. W. Griffith Film Festival\\" she had a heart attack which began a series of heart troubles which limited her in her final years. Cooper died at Cedars Nursing Home on April 12, 1976. She had been there since suffering a stroke earlier the same year. Her death left Lillian Gish as the sole surviving cast member of The Birth of a Nation.New York Times, \\"Miriam Cooper Walsh, 84, Star In Birth of a Nation\\", April 14, 1976, Page 36 She is buried in the New Cathedral Cemetery in Baltimore, Maryland.Resting Places Her papers were donated to the Library of Congress.http://lcweb.loc.gov/cgi- bin/zclient?host=z3950.loc.gov&port;=7092&attrset;=BIB1&rtype;=USMARC&DisplayRecordSyntax;=HTML&ESN;=F&startrec;=1&maxrecords;=10&dbname;=Voyager&srchtype;=1,9,2,3,3,1,4,1,5,1,6,1&term;_term_1=mm+79056986 Legacy Cooper is primarily known today for her performances in Birth of a Nation and Intolerance. Very few of her films are known to survive. Only 3 of her 40 shorts still exist, while only 5 of her 21 features still exist. Her only non-Griffith features to survive are Kindred of the Dust (1922) and Is Money Everything? (1923). Personal life Cooper got along well with D. W. Griffith, saying he had been a perfect gentleman. However, when they first arrived in California, Cooper mistook his mannerisms as insulting (he had failed to return a hello to her one day). She complained to Mae Marsh, who was also trying to win Griffith's favor, and Marsh told Griffith. The next day on set, Griffith called Cooper \\"The Queen of Sheba\\". They worked out the misunderstanding but she recalled that, much to her annoyance, the nickname stuck for years afterwards. She claimed to have never been romantic with Griffith, like Lillian Gish or Mae Marsh. However, she did mention in her autobiography that he tried to kiss her once after offering her a ride home. After the release of \\"Birth of a Nation\\", Cooper's train stopped in Chicago, where Griffith was staying. He sent her a telegram asking her to see him in his hotel room but Cooper was unable to reach him. According to her, this stopped his romantic intentions with her. Though aware of Griffith's struggles later in life, she hadn't seen him since leaving for New York in 1916; she did visit his grave during her visit to Kentucky for \\"The D.W. Griffith Film Festival\\". Cooper got along well with most of Griffith's company including Dorothy Gish, Mary Alden, and Mae Marsh. She also was friends with Norma Talmadge, Mabel Normand, and Pola Negri. Though they were not close, she was fond of Lillian Gish. Cooper didn't get along with Teddy Sampson and she greatly disliked Theda Bara, who she felt was trying to steal Raoul Walsh away from her during the making of Carmen and The Serpent. In later years Cooper was good friends with Carole Lombard, whom she helped get some of her first roles. Cooper and Walsh were good friends with Charlie Chaplin in 1924. Chaplin was going through some troubling times and she found him gloomy and needy. She enjoyed him more once his personal life was back in order and he was much more cheery. Cooper met Raoul Walsh in 1914 when she joined Griffith's California Company. After Mae Marsh turned Walsh down for an Easter Mass date Walsh and Cooper began dating in 1915. Walsh had been Griffith's assistant director and asked Cooper if she would speak to Griffith about making him a director. On her advice Griffith made him a director a few weeks later. After directing one picture for Griffith, Walsh was signed to Fox Studios which filmed in New York while Cooper still had to film in California. The couple married in February 1916 and Cooper left the Griffith company to join Walsh in New York. Cooper intended to quit pictures to be a housewife and mother, but Walsh's gambling and cheating were big problems for her. One of the first nights she suspected him of cheating, she swallowed a bottle of carbolic acid and had to have her stomach pumped. However, Walsh continued to cheat during the marriage. As their successes grew, more trouble arose from debts and Cooper's resentment at being known as the Director's wife, something she was surprised at as she had thought she never wanted the spotlight. After Kindred of the Dust, Walsh admitted he didn‚Äôt think he loved her anymore. The marriage dragged on as both sides accused the other of cheating. Though they reconciled by 1925, Cooper was certain he was again cheating, this time with Ethel Barrymore, whom she confronted. Afterward, she threatened to divorce him. Walsh pleaded for forgiveness but Cooper found he was cheating with a young society girl who he was engaged to. The final moment came when Walsh began an affair with Cooper's friend Lorraine Miller. Cooper was furious and began divorce proceedings, threatening to put infidelity as her reason. However, in the days of morality clauses, this could have caused Walsh to lose his contract and William Fox talked her out of it. Instead she put 'irreconcilable differences'. The divorce was big news in Hollywood, with Gloria Swanson throwing Walsh a party, while Norman Kerry and Erich von Stroheim threw Cooper one. Not too long after Walsh, married Miller. Cooper desperately wanted children but was unable to conceive. Though she never learned the reason, she suspected it had to do with her kidney illness. She and Walsh adopted two boys: Jackie and Bobbie. After the divorce, both boys lived with her until their teenage years. Jackie got in trouble with the law several times, and Bobbie idolized him. At the advice of her preacher, Cooper sent Jackie to live with Walsh. On a visit, Bobbie asked to live there as well. Cooper and Walsh had been suing each other during the 1930s and Walsh later had the boys sue her as well.

At the age of 23, he joined the society of Katipunan, a movement which sought the independence of the Philippines from Spanish colonial rule and started the Philippine Revolution. Together with Andr√©s Bonifacio and Emilio Jacinto, they formed the secret chamber of the society called Camara Reina. He took charge of the publication of Ang Kalayaan, Katipunan's first and only official publication. He was the one who tried to convince the exiled Jos√© Rizal to join the revolutionary movement. He was also, however, among those who testified before a court martial against Rizal during the investigation that would lead to the hero's ultimate death. When the Katipunan was discovered, he fled to Balintawak (now part of Quezon City) on August 20, 1896, but he later availed of an amnesty that the Spanish colonial government offered and he surrendered on September 1, 1896. He was deported to Spain where he was tried and imprisoned in Madrid. He was later transferred to M√°laga, and then to a Spanish outpost in Africa. He was incarcerated for about two years. He returned to the Philippines in April 1899 and resumed his medical practice. He was immediately arrested by the Americans in fear of inciting insurrection. While still in prison, Valenzuela was elected the municipal president in his hometown Polo which forced the Americans to release him. From 1921-1925, he served as the governor of the province of Bulacan. Valenzuela was nevertheless under doubt whether he was a hero or a traitor. His patriotism was questioned due to his lenient and soft leaning towards the Spanish. Early years P√≠o Valenzuela was born in Polo, Bulacan (now the City of Valenzuela) to Francisco Valenzuela and Lorenza Alejandrino, who both came from wealthy families. P√≠o was the third eldest sibling of the Valenzuela family: Agustina (born 1861), Severo (born 1865) and Tom√°s (born 1871). His father came from a prominent family of gobernadorcillos of Polo. After he was tutored at home, he was brought to Manila to study at Colegio de San Juan de Letran. In 1888, he enrolled at University of Santo Tomas and finished his Licenciado en Medicina in 1895. He practiced his profession in Manila and Bulacan. In July 1892, when he was a medical student and the Katipunan was barely a week old, he joined this secret organization. He became a close friend of its founder, Andr√©s Bonifacio, and was godfather to the first child of Bonifacio and Gregoria de Jes√∫s. After their house burned down, Bonifacio and his family lived with Valenzuela. The revolutionary life He was elected fiscal of the secret society in December 1895. He was inducted together with the other elected officials at Bonifacio's home on New Year's Day in 1896. He used the nom de guerre \\"Dimas Ayaran\\" (untouchable) in the movement. Shortly after his induction, Valenzuela moved to San Nicolas district in Manila so he could supervise the publication of the secret society's official organ, where he also wrote articles using the nom de plume \\"Madlang-Away\\" (Public Conflict). Valenzuela claimed in his memoirs that he was supposed to be the editor of the publication but Emilio Jacinto would eventually be the one to supervise its printing. Valenzuela said he was the one who suggested the name Kalayaan (Freedom) for the publication. To mislead the Spanish authorities, he also suggested that they place the name of Marcelo H. del Pilar as editor and Yokohama, Japan as the place of publication. Kalayaan's first number, dated January 18, 1896, came out in March 1896 and consisted of a thousand copies which was distributed to Katipunan members all over the country. However, the publication only came out with one more issue because the Katipunan had already been uncovered by the Spanish authorities. He considered the publication of Kalayaan as the most important accomplishment of the secret chamber of the Katipunan, which he claimed consisted of himself, Bonifacio and Jacinto. In a meeting of the secret chamber in July 1896, they decided to assassinate the Spanish Augustinian friar who uncovered the Katipunan to the authorities, but they failed to accomplish the mission. Valenzuela also claimed that after the discovery of the Katipunan, he and Bonifacio distributed letters implicating wealthy Filipinos, who refused to extend financial assistance to the Katipunan. He was a member of the committee that was tasked to smuggle arms for the Katipunan from Japan. He was also with Bonifacio, Jacinto and Procopio Bonifacio when they organized the Katipunan council in Cavite. At the secret general meeting called by Bonifacio on the night of May 1, 1896 at Barrio Ugong in Pasig, Valenzuela presented to the body a proposal to solicit contributions to buy arms and munitions from Japan. The proposal was approved on condition that it first be approved by Jos√© Rizal, who was in exile in Dapitan in Mindanao. Valenzuela was tasked to discuss the matter with Rizal and he left for Dapitan on June 15, 1896. However, Rizal told him that the revolution should not be started until sufficient arms had been secured and the support of the wealthy Filipinos had been won over. When the Katipunan was discovered, he fled to Balintawak on August 20, 1896, but he later availed of an amnesty that the Spanish colonial government offered and he surrendered on September 1, 1896. He was deported to Spain where he was tried and imprisoned in Madrid. He was later transferred to M√°laga, Barcelona and then to a Spanish outpost in Africa. He was incarcerated for about two years. Under the Americans He returned to the Philippines in April 1899. In Manila, he was denounced to the American Military authorities as a radical propagandist and once more imprisoned up to September of the same year. To suppress aggressive leadership upon his release, he was made municipal president of Polo. From 1902 to 1919, he served as president of the military division of his district. From 1919 to 1925, he served the people of Bulacan for two terms as provincial executive. As governor, he was uncompromising against graft and corruption in the government. After he retired from politics, he wrote his memoirs on the revolutionary days. He also practiced his medical profession, but only for philanthropic purposes. He was married to Marciana Castro by whom he had seven children. Early in the morning of April 6, 1956, he died in his hometown, and was buried at the local cemetery. In popular culture Valenzuela was portrayed in various films which featured or centered on the Revolution. He was portrayed by the following actors in these films: * 1997 - Nonie Buencamino in Rizal sa Dapitan. * 1998 - Marco Sison in the biopic Jose Rizal. * 2012 - Sonny Alcantara in El Presidente. * 2013 - Yuwin Cruz in the TV series, Katipunan. * 2013- Zieg Tercias in the Musical 1863 He was also portrayed by the following actors in the theater production Nom de Plume: Madlang Away of the Valenzuela City Center for the Performing Arts: * 2006 - Arnold Reyes and Joel Molina, held at the Valenzuela City Convention Center * 2013 - Marxs Escondo and Dariel Bagual, held at the Valenzuela City Convention Center. * 2015 - Joel Molina and Dariel Bagual, held at the Valenzuela People's Park.

It is written by Ian Edginton, with art by Simon Davis. The story is fully painted and is set in a prison called Long Barrow Maximum Security Prison where the main character, David Sorrel, has been sentenced to life, following the murder of his wife and her lover.  Plot  David Sorrel has been sentenced to life in Long Barrow Maximum Security Prison on Dartmoor, following the murders of his wife and her lover, who are also beheaded. He is put in a cell with Harry Rivers, who tells him that he must some reputation and that he will be tested by some of the dangerous inmates as well. David is tested almost straight away when he bumps into Nathan Grice, who picks a fight with him. David wins it even though Grice cheats by using a small blade that he was carrying in his pocket, to cut his face a little. David is dreaming about the night that he murdered his wife and her lover, in which he grins an insane smile, one which resembles the monster Grice's. His cellmate Harry Rivers wakes him up and David tells him about that particular night that got him locked away in the first place. He says that when he was arrested he could not tell the police a thing. Hell is breaking loose in Long Barrow Prison as a guard runs through the blood-splattered corridors before being decapitated by one of the monsters. In the ventilation ducts, Harry and David watch. They are trying to find their way out of the prison and Harry seems to know where they are going, so David asks how. Harry tells him that he was allowed to write a book about the prison once, giving him access to the internet where he discovered facts about the ventilation system, cellars, and exits. They continue through the ducts when David stops him, realizing it is too quiet. Harry looks out of a vent only to find two of the creatures staring at him. Harry holds them off as David climbs higher up the ducts. Harry follows quickly and they decide to get out of the ducts but David is hit by a guard, mistaking him for one of the creatures. David is having another flashback where it is revealed that the lover of David's wife is none other than his best friend. Outside the house, David is grabbed by some sort of claw. At the prison, the woman begs David to help her and Harry. David says that they should be grateful they are alive and says that David Sorrel no longer exists. He is The Light and the Way and is crucified inside out while the creatures experiment on him. Harry, on the other hand, undergoes a transformation just like the monsters themselves. He tells them about their origins and that his blood is what caused the infection. He died of a broken heart and has returned to unmake the world. David reveals that there are more of the alien-like creatures in other places like prisons all over the world. He reveals that he only murdered his wife so he could get inside. Suddenly he feels pain and shouts to the aliens for air. Some kind of gas is revealed and it seems that the unknown woman is about to be killed by Grice. But luckily the horribly mutated Harry has managed to fight off the transformation and kills him with a pole and tells the woman to make a run for it. The Harrowers The story picks up some time after the events of the first story, with Sara living in a house near the destroyed prison. The \\"otherworlders\\" have broken into our world despite the incident at Longbarrow and appear to have changed, or at least there are different types of them. She is attacked by them, but Harry is protecting her but doesn't get there in time to save Sara's dog. Once Harry shows up and kills the last otherworlder. Suddenly, they realise the Sheeny has transformed into a creature and is trying to wreck the bio-weapon they brought with them to try and kill the TDI's. They gun her down and find out that she is, in fact, a transvestite. Briggs tells them that most of the damage it can be easily repaired. Harry and Walker throw themselves on the horde to slow them down, but Walker is killed and so is Harry. They reach the location where they arrived, and use a communicator scavenged of Carmody's remains to call home. The base refuse to open the gate because the risk is too great. The horde of creatures is getting closer, but Harry emerges from the, now missing an arm, rejoins the group. He tells them that the Otherworld was created by extra-dimensional intelligence to try and force the creatures to evolve from their physical form to leave their Universe. However, the creatures degenerate instead of evolving and they find a physical way to leave rather than a metaphysical one. However, it turns out that human beings can make this evolutionary jump, and Sorrel tells them that he and the other light-beings will destroy all trace of mankind in the Otherworld to hide this fact from the extra-dimensional entities. He opens up a portal, but Harry chooses to remain in the Otherworld. Sorrel gives Sara a snow globe, to destroy all the creatures in the Universe. Sorrel confirms Harry's suspicion that he will have to be killed, to hide all evidence of mankind in the Otherworld, though he goes onto tell him he will probably become a light-being like himself.  Characters  *David Sorrel has murdered his wife, who was cheating on him with another man. He has now been sent to Long Barrow Maximum Security Prison where he has made friends with Harry Rivers and a rivalry with Nathan Grice, who has now mutated into a monster. *Harry Rivers is an older inmate of Long Barrow and has had David Sorrel thrown in his cell.

According to the 2001 census it had a population of 318, increasing to 412 at the 2011 census. It is approximately north from Lincoln, and just off the A15. The name Normanby is from the Old English and Old Scandinavian Northman+by, or \\"Northman village\\". In the 1086 Domesday Book, the village is given as Normanebi. Normanby by Spital also has a neighbouring village called Owmby-by-Spital. St. Peter's Church dates from the 12th century and is a Grade I listed building. It is redundant and maintained by the Churches Conservation Trust. The church is dedicated to St.Peter and St.Paul. It was extensively renovated in 1890 and it currently seats 100 people. There was a Methodist chapel but now it has been converted into a habitable accommodation. The village facilities include a primary school, a post office, a store, The Bottle and Glass public house, and a school hall. The school hall holds activities such as a youth club and an art club. Normanby by Spital primary school received a 2006 Ofsted inspection rating of Grade 1 (outstanding). A following 2010 inspection rated the school as Grade 2 (good). During the Second World War, a wireless station was in operation along Normanby Cliff Road which was connected to RAF Scampton and was used to transmit messages to Bomber Squadrons over Germany or other enemy territory. Each Bomber Command Group had a similar site and they could be found all over the east of the country. The R/T operators were based at RAF Bawtry, Doncaster. This role continued throughout the \\"Cold War\\" period when transmissions were made to the 24/7 airborne V-Bomber squadrons. In later years this role diminished and the station finally closed; the buildings have now been demolished although the site is still fenced off. The Bottle and Glass public house was open for duration of the war, as it was a frequent rest-stop for local airmen. Residents of the village remember the Dambusters raid, hearing the Lancasters going overhead and being concerned that they were \\"struggling\\" to keep in the air.

He is best known for being one of the earliest individuals to rebel against the British East India Company's supremacy in India. Early life Velayudhan Thampi was the son of Manakkara Kunju Mayatti Pillai and his wife Valliyamma Pillai Thankachi of Thalakkulam. He was born on 6 May 1765 in the village of Thalakkulam in Travancore which is in the present day district of Kanyakumari in Tamilnadu then a southern district of Travancore State. His full title was \\"Idaprabu Kulottunga Kathirkulathu Mulappada Arasarana Irayanda Thalakulathu Valiya Veettil Thampi Chempakaraman Velayudhan\\" being from the family that held the ownership of the province and the high title of Chempakaraman for their services to the modern state created by Maharajah Marthanda Varma. Velu Thampi, was appointed a Kariakkar or Tahsildar at Mavelikkara during the initial years of the reign of Maharajah Dharmaraja Ramavarma. Rise to Dalawaship Bala Rama Varma was one of Travancore's least popular sovereigns whose reign was marked by unrest and various internal and external political problems. He became rajah at the age of sixteen and fell under the influence of the corrupt nobleman Jayanthan Sankaran Nampoothiri from the Zamorin of Calicut's kingdom. One of the first atrocities of his reign was the murder of Raja Kesavadas,P. Shungunny Menon. History of Travancore. Page 245. the then Dewan of Travancore. Sankaran Nampoothiri was subsequently appointed Dewan or Prime Minister assisted by two other ministers. The state treasury was soon empty due to corruption so it was decided to collect money by ordering the tahsildars (district officers) to pay large amounts of money which were determined without any reference to the revenue of the districts. Velu Thampi, the Tahasildar(Karyakar) of a southern district, was ordered to pay Rs. 3000 to which he responded that he needed three days to pay. Velu Thampi returned to his district, gathered the people and an uprising ensued. People from all parts of Travancore united to surround the palace and demand the immediate dismissal and banishment of Jayanthan Sankaran Nampoothiri. They also demanded that his two ministers (Matthoo Tharakan,Sankaranarayanan chetty) be brought to a public place then undergo flogging and have their ears cut off. The punishments were duly carried out and the two ministers were put in jail at Trivandrum. Velu Thampi was later appointed the Dalawa of Travancore.P. Shungunny Menon. Thiruvithancore Charitram. (History of Travancore). Page 245-251. Career as Dalawa Sculpture of Velu Thampy Dalawa in the Secretariat campus, Thiruvananthapuram After Velu Thampi became Dalawa of Travancore he faced serious opposition from two relatives of the late Raja Kesavadas who sought assistance to get rid of him from their associates in Bombay. These letters were intercepted and presented to the Maharajah in a negative light and he ordered the immediate execution of the two men, Chempakaraman Kumaran Pillai and Erayiman Pillai. Having cleared the way, Velu Thampi became Dalawa with no opposition. The Madras Government sanctioned his appointment within a few months. Velu Thampi was not an able statesman like Ramayyan Dalawa or Raja Kesavadas, his immediate two predecessors. He was of rebellious nature. Within three years of the death of Raja Kesavadas the country was plagued with corruption and various problems caused by the banished Namboodiri Dalawa. Velu Thampi resorted to harsh punishments with a view to improve the situation. Flogging, cutting off of ears and noses as well as nailing people to trees were some of the punishments adopted during his term as Dalawa. Nevertheless, his harsh measures produced results and peace and order were restored within a year of Velu Thampi's accession to the Dalawaship. Intrigues The Dalawa's undue severity and overbearing conduct resulted in resentment amongst his colleagues, the very same people who had assisted his rise to power. A conspiracy was formed against him under the influence of Kunjunilam Pillai, a powerful Travancore cabinet official who succeeded in getting the Maharajah to sign a royal warrant to arrest and immediately execute Velu Thampi Dalawa. The Dalawa was at Allepey when he received news of the conspiracy and immediately hurried to Cochin to meet the British Resident, Major Macaulay, who had become a good friend. Macaulay had already received evidence that Kunjunilam Pillai had a major hand in the murder of Raja Kesavadas and hence he armed Velu Thampi with a small force of British soldiers and sent him to Trivandrum to investigate Kunjunilam Pillai's conspiracy. Pillai was found guilty of murder and conspiracy and punished accordingly. With this obstacle removed, Velu Thampi regained his former influence. Mutiny of the Nair troops The armies of Travancore consisted mainly of members of the Nair group of castes. Velu Thampi's 1804 proposal to reduce their allowances was met with immediate discontent. The troops believed that the idea had come from the British and immediately resolved to assassinate both Major Macaulay and Velu Thampi. Velu Thampi fled once more to Cochin to seek refuge with Macaulay. The Nairs marched to Trivandrum with a ten thousand strong army of sepoys and demanded that the Maharajah immediately dismiss the Dalawa and end any alliance with the British. Meanwhile, the Resident and the Dalawa collected forces at Cochin and, assisted by the Carnatic Brigade, marched to Trivandrum and put an end to the mutiny. Several of its leaders were executed in the most gruesome manner. One Krishna Pillai, a commander of a regiment, had his legs tied to two elephants which were driven in the opposite direction, tearing him to pieces. Alliance with the British The Treaty signed with the British East India Company by the popular Maharajah Dharma Raja Rama Varma in 1795 was revised in what is known as the Treaty of 1805 (according to the English East India Company's policy of \\"Subordinate Isolation\\") after the insurrection of the Nair troops in Travancore. It increased the British Indian force stationed in Travancore and the amount of money to be paid as tribute to the British, though the expenditure of the State in maintaining its own standing army was drastically cut. This was the main change brought about in the Treaty of 1805. Position Travancore was at that time, owing to all its internal problems, facing a heavy financial crisis and the ratification of the Treaty by Velu Thampi created serious discontent as it increased the dependence of Travancore on the British and also made it indebted to the English Company. In spite of being fully aware of the financial crisis in Travancore, the Resident Major Macaulay pressed Velu Thampi for immediate payment of the large amount of tribute and the expenses of putting down the mutiny of the Nair troops. The Maharajah meanwhile wrote to the Madras government for the recall of the Resident and appointment of a new Resident which was denied. But this news made the Resident more obstinate against Travancore and he pressurised the Dalawa for payments immediately. The Dalawa was now disillusioned with the British whom he had considered a friend and who considered any \\"aggression on Travancore as an aggression on themselves\\" as per the previous treaties. His discontent was first given vent to by the assassination of the ambassador of the Resident in the court. The Maharajah had communicated his discontent with the Dalawa to this ambassador, a certain Subba Iyen, and this information was known to the Maharajahs wife, Arumana Amma, a noblewomen of the Arumana Ammaveedu family. She was a lady of influence, who apparently communicated Royal secrets to the Dalawa, and she informed the Dalawa of the Maharajah's intention to dismiss him, with support from the Resident. This increased the anger of the Dalawa against the British. First the Resident demanded for impossible amounts of money and now he had started interfering with the internal affairs of the state. Insurrection The Mannadi Temple, where Thampi committed suicide Velu Thampi Dalawa and the Paliath Achan, Govindan Menon, met and decided on the extirpation of the British Resident and end of British supremacy in their respective states. Velu Thampi organised recruits, strengthened forts and stored up ammunition while similar preparations was made by the Paliath Achan in Cochin. Velu Thampi appealed to the Zamorin of Calicut and to the French for assistance, but both did not acknowledge the request. The plan of the Paliath Achan and Velu Thampi was to unitedly attack the Fort of Cochin and murder the British Resident Major Macaulay and Kunju Krishna Menon. Another force was appointed to attack the British garrison at Quilon. This was in 1809 and is known as Battle of Quilon. In the aftermath of the battle, Velu Thampi fled from Trivandrum and committed suicide in the Mannadi Temple. The Government of Kerala instituted a memorial to Dalawa, a research centre, a museum, a park and a statue at Mannadi near Adoor. Another statue of Velu Thampi Dalawa can be found in front of the Secretariat of Kerala in Trivandrum. Honours Velu Thampi Dalawa Museum, Mannadi The sword that was used by Velu Thampi Dalawa to fight against British imperialism, was kept with the Kilimanoor royal family, for about 150 years. It was presented in 1957, to India's then president Rajendra Prasad by a member of the royal family.

In the film adaptation of the musical, it was sung by Shani Wallis. A reprise of this song towards the end of the show expresses Nancy's affection for young Oliver Twist, implying that she now feels that the child also needs her. This reprise was omitted from the film version. Its popularity grew by virtue of renditions by several popular singers, including Shirley Bassey who reached number two for 5 weeks on the United Kingdom charts with the song. Bassey's recording became one of the highest sellers of 1960 staying on the UK charts for 30 weeks. The song has also been sung as \\"As Long as She Needs Me\\", when sung by a male singer.

She is the former chancellor of the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education and the Florida Board of Regents. She has served in a variety of faculty and academic administrative positions at various institutions over the course of her career, including president of the University of Mary Washington, serving as that university's first female president. Early life and education Hample grew up in Tennessee and wanted to be a scientist. She attended David Lipscomb University where she was also a member of the debate team. As a student, her lab studies conflicted with her debating so she changed her focus on communications in order to continue traveling as part of the team. She earned a Bachelor of Arts from the university in 1969, majoring in communication and secondary education (French). Hample went on to attend Ohio State University where she earned a Master of Arts and Ph.D. in Communication.President's Biography, Dr. Judy G. Hample Career Upon graduating from Ohio State University, Hample received her first faculty appointment as a lecturer and debate coach at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. She has held tenured professorships during all of her administrative appointments,including her first administrative appointments which came while at Western Illinois University. She was first made a department division director, later becoming assistant dean for the College of Arts and Sciences. Hample served as dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at Emporia State University before moving on as the dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at Indiana State University in 1986. After leaving ISU, she became the senior vice president of academic affairs at the University of Toledo until joining the Florida Board of Regents in 1998. From 1998 to 2001, Hample served in various positions for the Florida Board of Regents. She served at the vice chancellor for planning, budgeting and policy analysis from 1998 to 2001. In 1999 she was appointment executive vice chancellor. Hample was appointment as the chancellor of the Board in 2001, succeeding Adam Herbert for whom she served as the executive vice chancellor. Her appointment came at the time when then Governor Jeb Bush's plans to overhaul the Florida educational system and allow each university to have its own board was approved by the Florida Legislature. Hample worked with the regents and trustees to help with the transition. She also served as the liaison to the state task force that studied the implementation of the educational system overhaul. Hample was the last chancellor for the Board, attending the last meeting at the University of South Florida campus in May 2001. Hample joined the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education in 2001, becoming only the 2nd chancellor in its 34-year history. She oversaw an annual operating budget of $1.8 billion with more than 12,000 faculty and staff for a system that oversaw the 109,000-student state university system. Much of her work was centered at the Dixon University Center in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. She reported to an appointed Board of Governors and represented the system before the state capital. During her time as Chancellor, Hample implemented a budgeting system that linked performance improvement to funding in order to enforce accountability of school's use of state funding. Her system was later adopted by approximately a third of state legislatures. She left her position in 2007 and later joined the University of Mary Washington as its eighth president. At the University of Mary Washington, Hample was the first female president in the history of the school. Hample became the third president in three years to leave the school's presidency. She resigned in the second year of her presidency after a closed door meeting with the Board of Visitors in February 2010. Her tenure was not without controversy, including a state investigation into money Hample spent on the president's residence and testing a security-alarm during a campus safety walk.

Al Khamsa roughly translates as 'The Five'. It refers to a mythical group of foundation mares that were the legendary founders of the Arabian breed. While some breeders claim these mares really existed, there is no objective, historical way to verify such a claim. The modern definition of an Arabian as Al Khamsa usually refers to a horse that can be verified in every line of its pedigree to trace to specific named desert-bred Arabians with documentation that their breeding was attested to by a Bedouin seller who had sworn a formal oath (generally invoking Allah) that the animal was asil or pure of blood. This standard is only met by approximately two percent of all registered Arabians today. Such horses included the desert-bred imports of the Crabbet Arabian Stud, the imports from Syria of Homer Davenport, many of the horses imported from Egypt that were originally bred by Muhammad Ali of Egypt, Abbas Pasha, Ali Pasha Sherif, or the Royal Agricultural Society and its successor organizations, and other desert-bred horses obtained throughout the Middle East by buyers such as Carl Raswan who were familiar with bloodlines and the formal sales procedures of the Bedouin to properly document animals of Asil bloodlines. The Legend The legend of Al Khamsa refers to the five favorite horses of Muhammad. While there are several variants on the tale, a common version states that after a long journey through the desert, Muhammad turned his herd of horses loose at an oasis for a desperately needed drink of water. Before the herd reached the water, Muhammad blew his battle horn for the horses to return to him. Only five mares responded. Because they faithfully returned to their master, though desperate with thirst, these mares became his favorites and were called Al Khamsa, and became the legendary founders of the five \\"strains\\" of the Arabian horse.Archer, Arabian Horse, pp. 92‚Äì93 Although the Al Khamsa are generally considered fictional horses of legend,, p. 12 some breeders today claim the modern Bedouin Arabian actually descended from these mares., pp. 3‚Äì4 Modern horses that can trace all of their bloodlines to documented Bedouin strains are collectively known as \\"Al Khamsa Arabians\\".Staffa, Kelsa. Fire in the Heart: The Al Khamsa Arabian , (Cult)ure Magazine, December 15, 2010. Accessed June 23, 2011. Strains Over time, the Bedouin developed several sub-types or strains of Arabian horse, each with unique characteristics, and traced through the maternal line only.Derry Bred for Perfection pp. 104-105 The five primary strains, attributed to have descended from the Al Khamsa were known as the Keheilan, Seglawi, Abeyan or Obeyan, Hamdani, and Hadban or Hedban. Carl Raswan, a promoter and writer about Arabian horses from the middle of the 20th century, held the belief that there were only three strains, Kehilan, Seglawi and Muniqi or Maanagi. Raswan felt that these strains represented body \\"types\\" of the breed, with the Kehilan being \\"masculine\\", the Seglawi being \\"feminine\\" and the Muniqi being \\"speedy\\".Archer, Arabian Horse, p. 92 There were also lesser strains, sub- strains, and regional variations in strain names.Forbis Classic Arabian Horse pp. 274‚Äì289 Purity of bloodline was very important to the Bedouin, and they also believed in telegony, believing if a mare was ever bred to a stallion of \\"impure\\" blood, the mare herself and all future offspring would be \\"contaminated\\" by the stallion and hence no longer Asil. p. 22 ReferencesExternal links *Al Khamsa organization Arabian and part-Arabian horses ","title":"Al Khamsa"},{"id":"6369553","text":"Trisent Ltd is a UK software applications company launched in May 2016.

Jacobetti (July 20, 1920 ‚Äì November 28, 1994) was a Democratic politician from the U.S. state of Michigan. He holds the record as the longest-serving member of the Michigan House of Representatives, serving from 1955 until his death in 1994, representing Michigan's 108th and 109th districts.  Early life  Dominic was born in Negaunee, Michigan, to Italian immigrants, Nick and Josephine Jacobetti. He lived in Negaunee and graduated from St. Paul's High School in 1938. His first job was a miner for the Athens Mining Company. He was quickly promoted to the president of the local United Steel Workers Union. He married Marie Burnette in 1942 and had three children: Judith, Colin, and Dominic Jr. He was first elected to the Michigan House of Representatives in November 1954 and took office in January 1955.  Career as a Michigan state representative  Jacobetti represented Michigan's 108th district from 1955 to 1992 and the 109th district from 1993 until his death in 1994. Both districts are located in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. He served on the Educational Institutions Committee, Tuberculosis Hospitals Committee, Conservation Committee, House Policy Committee, State Affairs Committee, Appropriations Committee, just to name a few. He was the Chairman of many of these committees. He is renowned for his work towards improving the life of his constituents. He fought for improving education, preventing the dumping of nuclear waste in the Upper Peninsula, tax limitation, seatbelt laws, insurance reform, veterans' rights, and legalizing abortions. He also fought to make Michigan's Upper Peninsula the 51st state. He commissioned the building of Marquette, Michigan's Superior Dome. Jacobetti was almost never opposed in elections. In fact his only major opponent during his forty-year tenure was Alva J. Menhennick, who only received about thirty-five percent of the popular vote. Jacobetti was a delegate to Democratic National Convention from Michigan in 1960 and 1964. In the 1970s, Jacobetti helped efforts to make a separate state of Superior in the Upper Peninsula. He was a staunch Catholic, and a member of numerous organizations, including the Moose; Eagles; Knights of Columbus; Elks; Lions. Jacobetti died in office on November 28, 1994 at his home in Negaunee. His burial location is the Northland Chapel Gardens in Negaunee Township. It was through his long tenure as the head of the Appropriations Committee, though, that Jacobetti had the largest impact. Jacobetti's chairmanship of the Appropriations Committee wielded significant influence over direction of revenue in the state of Michigan and this made Jacobetti a powerful politician. Though the Upper Peninsula of Michigan is relatively low in population in comparison to the rest of the state, Jacobetti used his position to help direct sometimes significant funding to the Upper Peninsula (considering its low population), including the building of the Superior Dome, among other projects. It was his position and influence that was pointed to when an effort to pass a term limits amendment to the state constitution was initiated, an effort which was successful. In the last few years of his tenure on the committee, there was a scandal involving misappropriation of funds by the committee. Jacobetti was initially stripped of his chairmanship and a number of Fiscal Agency employees were investigated and imprisoned. Jacobetti was re-elected to his final term of office in 1994 and cleared of any wrongdoing in the House Fiscal Agency scandal by Michigan Attorney General Frank J. Kelley.  Death  Jacobetti died suddenly at the age of 74 just weeks after being re-elected to his 21st and final term. He was succeeded by Michael Prusi. Now that there are term limits in the Michigan House of Representatives, no one can ever serve longer than Jacobetti, barring the repeal of current term limit statutes.  Honors and awards  Jacobetti was affectionately nicknamed Puga (pronounced: Pooga), King Jake, and Godfather of the U.P. In 1978 he was named one of the \\"Ten Outstanding State Legislators in the United States\\" because of his efforts to provide adequate staffing in governmental offices. He was named U.P. Person of The Year, received the Distinguished Citizens Award, the Honorary Doctors of Law degree from Northern Michigan University, and the Good Neighbor of the Year Award. The D.J. Jacobetti Home for Veterans in Marquette, Michigan and the D. J. Jacobetti Vocational Skills Center at Northern Michigan University are named after him. The Michigan Department of Transportation has designated a portion of M-28 in the Upper Peninsula in his honor.

The adaptation was made by Garrett Horder in his 1884 Congregational Hymns.Ian C. Bradley, Abide with me: the world of Victorian hymns (1997), p. 171; Google Books. In the United Kingdom, the hymn is usually sung to the tune \\"Repton\\" by Hubert Parry. In the US, the prevalent tune is \\"Rest\\" by Frederick Charles Maker. Text The text set appears below. Some hymnal editors omit the fourth stanza or resequence the stanza so that the fifth stanza as printed here comes last. If sung to Parry's tune, \\"Repton\\", the last line of each stanza is repeated. The Brewing of Soma \\"The Brewing of Soma\\" is the Whittier poem (1872) from which the hymn is taken. Soma was a sacred ritual drink in Vedic religion, going back to Proto-Indo-Iranian times (ca. 2000 BC), possibly with hallucinogenic properties. The storyline is of Vedic priests brewing and drinking Soma in an attempt to experience divinity. It describes the whole population getting drunk on Soma. It compares this to some Christians' use of \\"music, incense, vigils drear, and trance, to bring the skies more near, or lift men up to heaven!\\" But all in vain - it is mere intoxication. Whittier ends by describing the true method for contact with the divine, as practised by Quakers: Sober lives dedicated to doing God's will, seeking silence and selflessness in order to hear the \\"still, small voice\\", described in I Kings 19:11-13 as the authentic voice of God, rather than earthquake, wind or fire. The poem opens with a quote from the Rigveda, attributed to Vasishtha: > These libations mixed with milk have been prepared for Indra: > offer Soma to the drinker of Soma. (Rv. vii. 32, trans. Max M√ºller). Associated tunes Hubert Parry Hubert Parry originally wrote the music for what became Repton in 1888 for the contralto aria 'Long since in Egypt's plenteous land' in his oratorio Judith. In 1924 George Gilbert Stocks, director of music at Repton School, set it to 'Dear Lord and Father of mankind' in a supplement of tunes for use in the school chapel. Despite the need to repeat the last line of words, Repton provides an inspired matching of lyrics and tune. By this time, Rest, by Frederick Maker (matching the metrical pattern without repetition), was already well established with the lyrics in the United States. Tunes it can be sung to are * Repton by Hubert Parry * Rest by Frederick Charles Maker * Hammersmith by William Henry Gladstone * Elegy for Dunkirk by Dario Marianelli Serenity (song by Charles Ives) The American composer Charles Ives took stanzas 14 and 16 of The Brewing of Soma (\\"O Sabbath rest.../Drop Thy still dews...\\") and set them to music as the song \\"Serenity\\"; however, Ives quite likely extracted his two stanzas from the hymn rather than from the original poem. Published in his collection: \\"114 songs\\", in 1919, the first documented performance of the Ives version was by mezzo- soprano Mary Bell, accompanied by pianist Julius Hijman. Uses * In 2005 the hymn was voted second in BBC One show Songs of Praise poll to find the United Kingdom's favourite hymn.BBC Songs of Praise poll, released 27 October 2005 (accessed 18 May 2009). * It was used in the Broadway production of the musical Jekyll & Hyde, at the wedding scene. * It can be heard being sung by the Bede College Choir in the 2007 film Atonement during the Dunkirk evacuation.Internet Movie Database * The pipes and drums of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards covered the hymn for their 2007 album, Spirit of the Glen: Journey. * It is quoted by the character Josh (Matt Keeslar) in the 1998 film The Last Days of Disco. *On June 12, 2016, the poem (set to the hymn tune Repton) was sung at the Cathedral Sings in the Washington National Cathedral, which was dedicated to the memory of Dr. J. Reilly Lewis, the longtime conductor of the Cathedral Choral Society and founder of the Washington Bach Consort, following his sudden passing on June 9, 2016. * It was sung and performed by the Cavaliers Drum and Bugle Corps in their 2016 show Propaganda to the tune of the Elegy for Dunkirk. * In a slightly modified lyrics version titled \\"Dear Ford and Father of Mankind\\", it was sung and performed in Lincoln Cathedral in The Grand Tour's Funeral for a Ford (series 3, episode 14).

Background Keith grew up in Los Angeles, California, with a house full of animals. Ever since she was a small child, Shannon rescued injured and homeless animals and nursed them back to health or placed them in loving homes. In later life, Keith became an animal rights activist, documentary film maker and animal rights lawyer. Animals are considered property, and she has striven to change that fact while defending animal rights activists in the courtroom, saving dogs condemned to death in Los Angeles, as well as litigating against those who abuse animals. Keith has represented a number of well-known animal-rights activists and campaigns, including Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty (SHAC) and Kevin Kjonaas, the former president of SHAC USA, against Huntingdon Life Sciences,Huntingdon Life Sciences Inc. v. Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty USA, Court of Appeal, Fourth Appellate District Court, Division One, State of California, June 1, 2005. and the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society. She has saved dogs from being euthanized in Los Angeles, and in 2000, she obtained the largest settlement against the City of Los Angeles for the beating to death of a dog by a city employee.Keith's bio , Animal Consultants International. Circa 2002, Shannon began to challenge the media with her strong message in support of animal liberation actions and activists. In 2004, Shannon started a non- profit, tax-exempt group called ARME (Animal rescue media education). ARME rescues homeless animals and focuses on stopping the problem at its roots through educational initiatives, including making documentaries about animals and animal activists. In 2006, after three years of filming, Keith released a documentary film about the Animal Liberation Front entitled Behind the Mask: The Story Of The People Who Risk Everything To Save Animals. The documentary was produced in response to what the ALF sees as a growing bias within the mainstream media towards the animal rights movement, both above and underground. Keith founded and runs Uncaged Films /ARME (Animal Rescue, Media & Education), which produced the documentary. Beagle Freedom Project Shannon Keith founded Beagle Freedom Project and its predecessor companies. Founded in 2004 as \\"ARME (Animal Rescue, Media & Education)\\", in 2018 it changed its name to \\"Rescue + Freedom Project\\" with Kevin Kjonaas as secretary, and in 2019 was changed to \\"Beagle Freedom Project\\". Kevin Kjonaas, also known as Kevin Jonas and Kevin Chase of SHAC 7 fame, is the Vice President of the project. Scandal Keith and the Beagle Freedom Project have come under fire for supposedly untruthful behavior, misleading people into thinking their rescue efforts were much worse than the actually were. In November 2013, the group \\"rescued\\" a beagle from UC Davis in Northern California who they say \\"spent the entirety of his short life as a test subject, never getting the chance to play or even smell fresh air. However, an investigation proved that the dog had only been at UC Davis for a couple of weeks, for teaching purposes, not research. No surgery or invasive procedures were involved other than the dog being spayed or neutered. The program at UC Davis involves 2 dogs a year, and the dogs are normally adopted afterward. In this case, the adoption was by a \\"Katie Johnson\\" of Livermore, but the address given was for a veterinary clinic in West Hollywood. Johnson took possession of the dog about 5 pm on one day, and the next afternoon was being photographed at a media event by Shannon Keith's nonprofit. The Beagle Freedom Project's secretary (as of 2016) was Kevin Kjonnas, also known as Kevin Chase, who was released from federal prison for his role in the campaign of threats, violence and harassment by SHAC‚ÄîUSA.

Education Clark studied Mathematics at Durham University (Hatfield College), graduating in 1964 with a first-class degree. Clark then continued his studies at Cambridge University, taking a second undergraduate degree in Philosophy in 1966. He earned a Ph.D. in 1980 from the University of London with thesis titled Predicate logic as a computational formalism. Career Clark undertook Voluntary Service Overseas from 1967-1968 as a teacher of Mathematics at a school in Sierra Leone. He lectured in Computer Science at the Mathematics Department of Queen Mary College from 1969 to 1975. In 1975 he moved to Imperial College London, where he became a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Computer Science and joined Robert Kowalski in setting up the Logic programming group. From 1987 to 2009 he was Professor of Computational Logic at Imperial College. Clark's key contributions have been in the field of logic programming. His 1978 paper on negation as failure was arguably the first formalisation of a non-monotonic logic. His 1981 paper on a relational language for parallel programming introduced concurrent logic programming. This was the programming paradigm adopted by the ambitious 1980s Japanese Fifth Generation Research Project with the goal of producing knowledge processing parallel computers. It was selected for its suitability for parallel execution even though it lacked the natural knowledge representation features of Prolog. Since 2010 Clark has worked closely with Peter Robinson of the University of Queensland on the TeleoR/QuLog language combination for programming multi-tasking communicating agents optionally controlling robotic devices. TeleoR is a rule based programming language that is a major extension of the Teleo-Reactive Procedures language T-R proposed by Nils Nilsson. T-R is a descendant of generalised hierarchical triangular table STRIPS plans, the planner of Shakey the robot, the first reasoning robot. QuLog is a flexibly typed hybrid language combining logic programming, functional programming and multi-threaded agent action programming. TeleoR is an application specific syntactic extension of QuLog. Business Interests In 1980, with colleague Frank McCabe, he founded an Imperial College spin-off company, Logic Programming Associates, to develop and market Prolog systems for micro- computers (micro-Prolog) and to provide consultancy on expert systems and other logic programming applications. The company's star product was MacProlog. It had had a user interface exploiting all the graphic user interface primitives of the Mac's OS, and primitives allowing bespoke Prolog based applications to be built with application specific interfaces. Clark has also acted as a Consultant to IBM, Hewlett-Packard and Fujitsu among other companies. Selected publications * K. L. Clark, D.

He developed a garden of medicinal plants for the hospital in Algeciras and published his Botanical Observations made in Andaluc√≠a in 1780, 1781 and 1782. Meanwhile, N√©e continued to collect plants in the mountains of M√°laga, Algeciras, Gibraltar, and Andalucia.Mallari (1988) In addition to collecting preserved specimens for the herbarium, N√©e gathered live plants which he then grew in his personal gardens. His proficiency as a gardener won him a royal commission in 1784 to create a new botanic garden in Pamplona.Madulid (1989) Malaspina expedition In 1788 Alessandro Malaspina, an officer in the Spanish Navy, petitioned the Spanish government to support a scientific expedition that would visit nearly all the Spanish possessions in the Americas and Asia. King Charles III, a promoter of science in the Spanish Empire, approved the venture which came to be known as the Malaspina Expedition. Malaspina planned to include three naturalists on his scientific team. He first hired Antonio Pineda and Thaddeus Haenke. Pineda was designated the lead naturalist and at his recommendation, Luis N√©e was proposed to fill the third spot. On February 4, 1789 King Charles IV officially appointed N√©e as a botanist on the expedition. The expedition, comprising two ships, set sail from Cadiz on July 30, 1789; N√©e was aboard the Atrevida, commanded by Jose de Bustamante y Guerra and Pineda was on the second ship, Descubierta, commanded by Malaspina. Haenke missed the start of the voyage and caught up with the ships nine months later. They stopped first in Montevideo on July 30, 1789 and then circled South America with stops in Patagonia, Chile, Peru, Panama, and Nicaragua. At each port N√©e spent several days or weeks collecting plants in the surrounding region. In addition to collecting plants, Malaspina recalled an incident when N√©e and Pineda tested a local species of Solanum on themselves resulting in severe vomiting and overall pain and swelling. When they reached Acapulco on March 27, 1791, N√©e and Pineda settled down for an extended period of botanizing in Mexico while the expedition proceeded along the coast of North America to Alaska. During the next six months N√©e collected almost 3,000 plant specimens while travelling over 1,500 miles throughout Mexico. Malaspina returned to Acapulco in December 1791 to pick up Nee and Pineda and then head west to Asia. Six weeks later they reached Marianas Islands where N√©e collected several rare plants that were later described in his publication, Observaciones Botanicas - Islas Marianas. From there they sailed to the Philippines, reaching Sorsogon Bay in early March 1792. N√©e was anxious to explore the interior of the island, so he arranged to be left at Sorsogon Bay and travelled alone to Manila where he met up with the expedition three months later. While in the Philippines he collected some 2,400 specimens and kept a journal where he recorded his observations on natural history, agriculture, and native customs. Meanwhile, Pineda was on a separate collecting trip when he became seriously ill and died. After the Philippines, the two ships visited Australia, New Zealand and Tonga before heading back across the Pacific to South America. From Chile, Nee again left the main expedition and journeyed overland across Chile and Argentina to meet up with the team in Montevideo. This was their last port of call; war was threatening in Europe and Malaspina was ordered to prepare his ships for possible battle and return home. They reached Cadiz on September 21, 1794,completing a voyage that lasted more than five years. Post-expedition N√©e remained in Cadiz until December, sorting and arranging the enormous number of plant specimens that had been collected by the expedition. He estimated that he personally had collected more than 12,000 specimens, the largest numbers coming from Mexico (2,900), the Philippines (2,400) and Peru (1,600). Much of this collection was transferred to the Royal Botanical Garden of Madrid where his friend Antonio Jos√© Cavanilles served as director. N√©e's collection ultimately formed the nucleus of the herbarium of the Royal Botanic Gardens. Despite his intention to identify and describe the entire collection, N√©e did not publish extensively but he did help Cavanilles with his botanical works and, after receiving a pension in 1801, published regularly in the Anales de Ciencias Naturales. He described several new plant species including Quercus agrifolia (coast live oak) and Quercus lobata (valley oak), both from California. This has sometimes led to the mistaken assumption that N√©e was in California, but these specimens were gathered by others on the expedition while he was in Mexico. Most of N√©e's botanical work ceased after 1804 and he died on October 3, 1807. N√©e had two sons from two different marriages. The botanists Jos√© Pav√≥n and Hip√≥lito Ruiz named the genus Neea in his honor.

The series was created by Susan Harris, and produced by Witt/Thomas/Harris Productions in association with Touchstone Television. Synopsis Good & Evil was the saga of two sisters, one an heir to the family cosmetics empire, the other a world-class scientist, and the backstabbing, jealousy, power struggles and other travails that occurred between them. Teri Garr starred as the \\"evil\\" sister, Denise Sandler, and Margaret Whitton as her \\"good\\" sister, Genevieve (\\"Genny\\"). Denise was icy and cutthroat, not just as CEO of Sandler Cosmetics, but in all other aspects of her life. However, it didn't always get her what she wanted. At work, she took great delight in mistreating her secretary Mary (Mary Gillis) and her dumb assistant Roger (Sherman Howard). Feeling long slighted by her family, Denise was now out to steal what she thought was rightfully hers‚Äîbeginning with presidency of the company. Elegant mother Charlotte (Marian Seldes) still ruled over Sandler Cosmetics with an iron fist, and was all too knowing of what her ruthless daughter was capable of. Charlotte, vain and caught up in her own legacy, promised to give Denise the helm when she reached retirement age‚Äîbut only when she looked 65 (her line of products made her look generations younger, in her eyes, at least). This was only the first motivation in Denise's extensive plotting. One of these plans was soon to include that of the man she felt destined to marry, dashing boyfriend Dr. Eric Haan (Lane Davies). Genny, meanwhile, had put her idealistic life back together after the death of her husband, and was hard at work testing new potential viruses that could be wiped out before they spread the world. A purist, Genny preferred to do lab testing on herself instead of on animals. Sensitive Genny did have her concerns; she couldn't understand why her beautiful daughter Caroline (Brooke Theiss) had been mute since the time of her father's death. For this and the family drama that was to ensue, Genny began seeing George (Mark Blankfield), a blind psychiatrist, who soon had her fighting off his romantic advances. George's presence and his constant following of Genny was awkward to deal with, as his ineptitude with a cane caused him to demolish everything in sight. Things became strenuous between cold Denise and sweet Genny when the latter was introduced to Dr. Eric. Genny and Dr. Eric had an instant falling for each other, and before long they gave in to the obvious and struck up an affair. When Denise witnessed this unfold, she drew up photo documents that threatened to blackmail Dr. Eric, so that Genny would disapprove of his so-called \\"seedy\\" behavior and dump him. The sisters feuded constantly after, with Denise's harsh intentions versus Genny's resilience as being the core conflict. Charlotte, who still couldn't accept that she was looking closer to her actual age, decided to retire‚Äîbut passed over the presidency to her new Southern boyfriend, Harlan Shell (Lane Smith), a billionaire who just purchased the company. Denise added Harlan to her \\"revenge list\\", and eventually plotted murder against him. In the premiere, Denise's husband Ronald (Marius Weyers), who had been presumed dead after a fall off Mount Everest four years earlier, was found to have remained frozen on the mountain and was thawed out by mountain climbers. Remarkably, Ronald remained physically unharmed but reassimilated back into society with revenge on his mind. He gave Denise and their teenage son David (Seth Green) a surprise homecoming, but it was quickly hinted that Denise, in fact, pushed Ronald off the cliff; in the following episodes, she had to keep Ronald's return a secret from everyone else and went to great lengths to get rid of him‚Äîin fact, she still wanted him dead. As Denise's evil plotting continued, David went on a search for the man he knew was his real father, lawyer Sonny (William Shockley). In the sixth episode, Denise successfully blackmailed Dr. Eric, exposing his closeted skeletons; in the aftermath, Eric's career was at stake and Genny dumped him before their wedding. Also, Caroline spoke for the first time since the loss of her father, and in the series; and as the half- hour came to a close, Denise was attempting to take Harlan's life. This cliffhanger would never be resolved for the viewing public to see, as Good & Evil was cancelled after that telecast.

In the last five, still-unaired episodes, Denise murdered Harlan, launching a huge investigation that put everyone on edge. Imperious mother Charlotte came out of retirement and regained control of the company; despite this, Denise continued to fight for her own control. Similarities to Soap and controversy The series was created by Susan Harris, who in the 1970s had created the wildly successful soap opera parody Soap. However, Good & Evil shared none of Soaps success. The ineptitude that blind George demonstrated in attempting to navigate his surroundings, frequently demolishing everything in sight with his red-tipped white cane, led to the picketing of ABC's offices by members of the National Federation of the Blind. ABC insisted that the program was not intended to be in any way realistic, but rather a \\"parody done to the extremes, and there is not a single character in the show intended to be believable.\\" Sources Brooks, Tim and Marsh, Earle, The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows References External links  * American Broadcasting Company original programming 1990s American sitcoms 1991 American television series debuts 1991 American television series endings Television series by ABC Studios English-language television shows ","title":"Good &amp; Evil (TV series)"},{"id":"6369731","text":"Howard Reid (born 1951) is a British documentary film maker and anthropologist.Faris, James C. \\"Southeast Nuba: A Biographical Statement\\" in Anthropological Filmmaking: Anthropological Perspectives on the Production of Film and Video for General Public Audiences ed. by Jack R.

In 1994, the battalions were amalgamated to form the 2nd Bn the Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment, later the Royal Rifle Volunteers. Most recently, its remnants can be traced to the formation of The Rifles.

He was the founder of the Society of the Holy Cross, a society for Anglo-Catholic priests. Early life Charles Lowder was born on 22 June 1820 at Lansdown Crescent, Bath, England, the eldest of two sons and four daughters of Charles Lowder, a banker, and his wife Susan Fuge. In 1835 he went to King's College School, London, before going to Exeter College, Oxford in February 1840. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree, a second in Greats in 1843 and a Master of Arts degree in 1845. While at Oxford he attended the University Church of St Mary the Virgin where he heard John Henry Newman preach. Under Newman's influence Lowder was drawn into the Oxford Movement and decided to enter the priesthood. Early parish ministry Lowder was ordained deacon at Michaelmas 1843 and became a curate at Walton near Glastonbury. He was ordained priest in December 1844 by Bishop Denison of Salisbury and became chaplain of the Axbridge workhouse. From 1845 to 1851 he was curate of Tetbury, Gloucestershire. However, Lowder wished to move to a parish with a more Catholic pattern of worship and in 1851 he became assistant curate to James Skinner at St Barnabas' Church, Pimlico. St Barnabas', a chapel of ease to St Paul's Knightsbridge was at the time at the vanguard of the Ritualist movement. The church lay at the heart of an area of slums, having been built to serve the poor. There was, however, controversy regarding St Barnabas' use of Catholic ritual. A Mr Westerton, an opponent of the high- church worship at St Barnabas', stood for the post of churchwarden in an attempt to bring them to a stop and hired a man to parade up and down the street wearing a sandwich-board canvassing for votes. In what he later called \\"a moment of madness\\" Lowder gave money to the choirboys to buy rotten eggs and encouraged them to pelt the board carrier.\\"A Field Guide to the English Clergy' Butler-Gallie, F p123: London, Oneworld Publications, 2018 As a result, Lowder was called in front of a magistrate and fined. He was also reprimanded by his bishop and suspended from duty for six weeks.Trench, Maria. Charles Lowder, A Biography, Kegan Paul, Trench & Co., London, 1882 Keeping a low profile, Lowder travelled to France and stayed at Yvetot seminary. While there he read a life of St Vincent de Paul. The example of Vincent and the Lazarists had a great influence on him and he was convinced of the need for a secular order of priests in the Church of England to provide mutual spiritual support to one another and to extend the Catholic faith, particularly among the poor. Society of the Holy Cross On 28 February 1855 in the chapel of the House of Charity in Soho, Lowder and five other priests founded the Society of the Holy Cross (SSC) and Lowder became the first Master. The five other founder members were Charles Maurice Davies, David Nicols, Alfred Poole, Joseph Newton Smith and Henry Augustus Rawes (three of whom would later become Roman Catholics). Lowder took up the austerest form of the society's rule of life and so committed himself to celibacy. The society grew quickly drawing other Anglo-Catholic priests from some of the poorest slum areas in London. Before long the society was at the forefront of the Catholic revival. The society was particularly influential in the second phase of Anglo-Catholicism following John Henry Newman's reception into the Roman Catholic Church. Many of the great SSC heroes were at one time Lowder's curates, including Alexander Heriot Mackonochie and Lincoln Stanhope Wainright (both of whom were later vicars of St Peter's, London Docks). Wapping St George in the East In August 1856 Lowder was invited by the rector to become head of the mission at St George's-in-the-East at the centre of the London Docks. The mission expanded quickly and later that year it opened an iron chapel (The Good Saviour) in Wapping and in 1857 began holding services in the rented Danish chapel of St Saviour and St Cross at Wellclose Square. In 1857 the mission was joined by Elizabeth Neale (sister of John Mason Neale) who founded the Community of the Holy Cross to assist in the mission's work.\\"St Saviour & St Cross Mission Chapel 1857-68\\", St George-in-the-East Church The presence of the sisters of the community allowed Lowder to extend the mission's work providing schools, a refuge for prostitutes, a hostel for homeless girls, night classes and parish clubs, an insurance scheme for dockers, coal for the poor and general poor relief. The mission was, however, controversial due to its high-church practices. Lowder, for example, wore eucharistic vestments (and was probably the first Anglican priest in London to do so). Riots took place outside the mission, stones were thrown and services were interrupted. Most of the trouble, however, focused on Lowder and the mission priests at the parish church and the chapels saw less trouble. Though he was often accused of \\"Romanism\\" Lowder was strongly loyal to the Church of England and was deeply upset by a number of his friends and curates becoming Roman Catholics (at one point all his curates left overnight, leaving him alone at the mission). St Peter's, London Docks In 1860 Lowder acquired land for a church and began raising funds. St Peter's, London Docks was consecrated on 30 June 1866 and Lowder became perpetual curate (and on the retirement of the previous rector in 1873, vicar). The day after the consecration cholera was discovered in the parish. The conscientious work of the mission priests and sisters during the ensuing epidemic earned Lowder the love of his parishioners. From then on he was known to them as \\"the Father of Wapping\\", \\"the Father\\" or \\"Fr Lowder\\". Lowder thereby became the first Church of England priest to receive the title \\"Father\\". Unlike many of his contemporaries, Lowder managed to avoid prosecution for ritualistic practices, largely on account of the respect for him among his parishioners and fellow clergy. An attempt in 1877‚Äì8 to prosecute him under the Public Worship Regulation Act was withdrawn by Archbishop Archibald Campbell Tait, who had helped draft the act, fearing that the prosecution would become a cause cel√®bre. The failure of the prosecution was a major victory for the Anglo-Catholic movement and contributed to the acceptance of advanced Catholic ritual in the Church of England. In later years overwork and a peptic ulcer forced him to take time to rest outside the parish. The last service Lowder attended at St Peter's was on 1 August 1880 for a 'High Celebration' to mark the fourth anniversary of the Church of England Working Men's Society. After the service, at which Richard Enraght had preached, the clergy and congregation assembled outside the church where J. B. Spalding, president of the St Peter's CEWMS, presented Lowder with a silver badge of the society, \\"as a small proof of his many acts of kindness\\".L. E. Ellsworth (1982). Charles Lowder page 164 A few weeks later Lowder died, probably of a perforated ulcer at Zell am See, Austria during a climbing holiday. A requiem mass was held at St Peter's and several hundred clergy and thousands of parishioners attended his burial at St Nicholas', Chislehurst. Legacy Grave of Lowder at St Nicholas' Church, Chislehurst. Lowder wrote two books, Ten Years in St George's Mission (London, 1867) and Twenty-one Years in St George's Mission (1877), detailing his work at the mission. Today, Lowder's influence lives on through the Society of the Holy Cross, St Peter's Church, St Peter's School and more generally through the Catholic tradition in the Church of England which he worked so hard to restore.

History NACODS was established as a national trade union in 1910. Prior to that date, the union existed as a federation of autonomous areas which were collectively known as the General Federation of Firemen's, Examiners' and Deputies Associations of Great Britain. The present title of NACODS was adopted in 1947 when the coal industry was nationalised. In 2016, the final three coal mines in the United Kingdom were closed. Following this, the union no longer had any working members, and it therefore decided to deregister as a trade union, and disaffiliate from the TUC, STUC and GFTU. It continued in existence as an unincorporated association with former workers in the industry holding honorary memberships.Trade Union Certification Officer, \\"National Association of Colliery Overmen, Deputies and Shotfirers\\", 9 September 2016 Strikes NACODS was much less willing to take industrial action than the NUM, which sometimes led to tension amongst workers in the mines. Militants in the NUM nicknamed NACODS the \\"National Association of Can-carriers, Obedient Dopes and Suckers\\". There were some confrontations during the 1972 strike, but nothing compared to what came in the 1984-85 strike. In April 1984, a small majority of NACODS voted to strike in support of the NUM, but this fell short of the two-thirds majority that their constitution required for a national strike. The National Coal Board had decided in the 1972 strike that a NACODS member was entitled to stay off work without any loss of pay if he faced violence or aggressive intimidation from NUM pickets. When the number of NUM strikebreakers increased in August, Merrick Spanton, the NCB personnel director, stated that he expected NACODS members to cross the picket lines to supervise their work. As this would have meant crossing aggressive (and sometimes violent) lines, it brought another ballot for a national strike from NACODS. For the first time in their history, NACODS voted to strike in September 1984 by a vote of 81%. However, a deal negotiated by North Yorkshire NCB Director Michael Eaton persuaded NACODS to call off the strike action in return to changes to the review procedures for threatened collieries. Ian MacGregor later admitted that if NACODS had gone ahead with a strike, a compromise would probably have been forced on the Coal Board. Files later made public showed that the Government had an informant inside the TUC, passing information about negotiations. General Secretaries :1910: Edward Williams :1914: William Frowen :1939: W.

Gladstone was born in Hawarden, Flintshire, Wales. He attended Eton College and read Greek and Latin at Christ Church, Oxford University. He was a member of parliament for a total of 20 years, representing Chester for 3, Whitby for 12 and East Worcestershire for 5. A singer and organist, he was well versed in musical history, especially the development of Anglican church music. He wrote on musical topics, and one of the views he expressed was that choral church services were to be deplored because \\"the choirs often discourage the congregations from singing\\". He wrote the anthems \\"Gracious and Righteous\\" and \\"Withdraw Not Thou\\", and chants, anthems, introits and organ voluntaries. He composed the hymn tunes Hammersmith, to which \\"Dear Lord and Father of Mankind\\" is sometimes set, and Ombersley,http://www.hymnary.org/tune/ombersley_gladstone sometimes used for \\"Lord of All Being, Throned Afar\\".

It is often noted as one of the band's best (if not the best) performances. It is also distinguished by its clear sound.http://ultimateclassicrock.com/led-zeppelin-bootlegs/ Overview The concert was recorded by a member of the audience, Mike Millard, and was later released illegally on vinyl without the permission of the band or the taper. The original vinyl issue of the show was released on Rock Solid Records, and featured the first 60 minutes of the concert, from \\"The Song Remains the Same\\" through to \\"Ten Years Gone\\". The cover art for the album featured the same group image of the band member's faces from the back cover of Led Zeppelin III, along with the mysterious obelisk from the cover of Presence. The first pressing for the album was on colored (red) vinyl, numbered 1 of 500. In the 1990s the complete recording of the show became available on CD through various releases, with most of them using the same \\"Eddie\\" title. Millard's recording remains one of the best-known Led Zeppelin bootlegs. Listen To This, Eddie is highly regarded amongst collectors not only because of the highly energetic performance by the band but also because it was captured in exceptionally good audio quality.Rey, Luis (1997) Led Zeppelin Live: An Illustrated Exploration of Underground Tapes, Ontario: The Hot Wacks Press. , p. 394. This can largely be attributed to the dedication and experience of Millard, who by 1977 had already made several bootleg recordings of other concerts performed at the Los Angeles Forum. It is believed that he recorded this particular show from row six. The complete Millard recording lasts 190 minutes and includes the entire concert (including encores). It was the first of six shows at the Los Angeles Forum by Led Zeppelin, which came towards the end of its 1977 North American concert tour. Millard's recording of the opening number from this concert, \\"The Song Remains the Same\\", was included in the promos menu of the Led Zeppelin DVD. The performance itself is regarded by some critics as being one of the best concerts of the 1977 tour, with Jimmy Page performing lengthy solos and John Bonham playing drums heavily, yet with precision. Robert Plant is very talkative and despite the damage done to his voice and range from constant touring he sounds quite good for this point in the band's history. The band is also open for lengthy improvisations, as evidenced on \\"No Quarter\\", on which John Paul Jones guides the band to multiple instrumental jams. Album title There are two unconfirmed theories about the meaning of the title \\"Listen To This Eddie\\". Neither theory has firm evidence to back it up. The first theory is that it is a reference to Eddie Van Halen of the band Van Halen, who in interviews has criticised the playing ability of Led Zeppelin guitarist, Jimmy Page.Dave Lewis and Simon Pallett (1997) Led Zeppelin: The Concert File, London: Omnibus Press. , p. 111. In particular, in an interview that Van Halen had given in January 1981 to Guitar World magazine, he was quoted as saying \\"Jimmy Page is an excellent producer. Led Zeppelin and Led Zeppelin II are classics. As a player, he's very good in the studio. I never saw him play well live. He's very sloppy. He plays like he's got a broken hand and he's two years old. But if you put out a good album and play like a two-year-old live. What's the purpose?\\" Following this line of thinking, the title is a call to ‚ÄúEddie\\" to listen to the recording of this brilliant performance and think again. However, the recording was made at a time when Eddie Van Halen was relatively unknown thus the attribution to him is likely apocryphal. The second theory comes from a Shockwaves Magazine article by Pat O'Connor entitled \\"The Ten Greatest Bootlegs\\",O'Connor,Pat, The Ten Greatest Bootlegs, Shockwaves Magazine.. According to O'Connor, the \\"Eddie\\" in the title is audio engineer Eddie Kramer, and not Eddie Van Halen, implying that even Kramer would be impressed by such an outstanding bootleg recording.

The \\"Eddie\\" in this case refers to Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam, who asked Young to take over the concert for him when he became too ill to sing. Many audience members expressed disappointment and impatience with the older musician, but most heard out his lengthy set, which included pieces from the Mirror Ball album Young had recorded with Pearl Jam. It is considered by collectors to be one of the highlight performances of Young's decades-long career.Pearl Jam and Neil Young: Polo Field, San Francisco, CA - June 24, 1995 Coincidentally, just before the acoustic set of Led Zeppelin's Listen to This, Eddie, Robert Plant refers to John Bonham as \\"the cowgirl in the sand\\", prompting an audience member to yell \\"Bring out Neil Young!\\".

The series takes place in modern-day Japan and follows amateur detective Jimmy Kudo (Japanese name: Shinichi Kudo) who solves cases in an episodic fashion while in his childhood body and under the alias Conan Edogawa. He is joined by childhood friend Rachel Moore (Ran Mori) and her father Richard Moore (Kogoro Mori) who runs a detective agency. Throughout the series, Conan interacts and befriends many characters from various groups: the Tokyo Metropolitan Police, the local police in Conan's prefecture; The Junior Detective League, a group of children who solves mysteries for their clients and the FBI. He also befriends a few individuals who know of his true identity: Dr. Agasa, who provides Jimmy with various spy gadgets; Harley Hartwell (Heiji Hattori), a high school detective from Osaka and Anita Hailey (Ai Haibara), the original developer of the poison who had also transformed into a child. The manga became licensed by Viz Media while the anime adaptation was licensed by Funimation. The two companies have Americanized many of the character names with both companies using different names or spellings for the same characters on several occasions. Other English editions such as the ones published in Singapore by Shogakukan Asia romanize the Japanese names.\\"Products -> Detective Conan Ten Seconds of Terror (show preview).\\" Shogakukan Asia. Retrieved on June 2, 2015. The list follows the names as presented by the Viz Media manga. Main characters=Jimmy Kudo Jimmy Kudo, known as in Japan, is the main protagonist of the series, a high school detective who solves difficult cases for the police. During one of his investigations, he is attacked and forced to take an experimental poison by a member of the Black Organization. However, due to a rare side-effect, he shrinks to the form of a young child. In order to keep his true identity a secret, he now goes under the alias and pretends to be a real child to throw off suspicion while he secretly solves many cases and looks for clues about the organization. He loves his childhood friend Rachel Moore, but cannot confess his feelings or reveal his true identity in order to protect her.

She is also skilled in Judo, like her father. She is very kind and helps anyone in need, even if that person is a potential criminal. In one instance, her kindness to Vermouth prompts the latter to keep Jimmy's identity a secret from the Black Organization. Like Jimmy, she dislikes the idea of killing anyone, including criminals, as she believes criminals should face punishment through the justice system. The Junior Detective League views her as a role model and the kids often turns to her for advice. She is skilled in house chores, including sewing, knitting, and cooking, and has very good fortune in games of chance, hardly ever losing in games such as mahjong. She spends most of her home life looking after Conan and her father, and hopes that her father and mother can reconcile their separation.

She shows affection towards Jimmy, but she denies having such feelings. Despite being constantly in the company of the Junior Detective League and Rachel Moore, she was very reserved and only opened up a little more to Rachel and Amy after some time; she later lets Amy call her \\"Anita-chan\\" instead of the more formal honorific \\"Anita- san\\".

After eleven months on the front line, he was shot in the head and killed when leading his men in an attempt to repel a German counter-attack on 2 October 1915 during the Battle of Loos. He was one of 22 MPs that were killed during the conflict and the only serving MP from Wales to be killed. The home ground of Cardiff City F.C. was named Ninian Park after Crichton-Stuart offered to be a guarantor for the football club's rental of the site. After his death, a statue of Crichton-Stuart was erected in Cathays Park in Cardiff. Early life Crichton-Stuart was born at Dumfries House in Ayrshire, Scotland. He was the second son of John Crichton- Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute, and his wife, the Honourable Gwendolen Mary Anne Fitzalan Howard, daughter of Edward Fitzalan-Howard, 1st Baron Howard of Glossop. Through his father, he was an illegitimate descendant of the House of Stuart. He was educated at Harrow School, showing promise in mathematics and foreign languages, and was expected to enter the diplomatic service. To further his studies, he travelled to Kiev in the Russian Empire and became a proficient Russian speaker. However, he was forced to return home after contracting a severe fever and instead attended Christ Church, Oxford once he had recovered. His family's estate included numerous properties and considerable land in Cardiff, including Cardiff Castle, and Crichton-Stuart frequently visited the city, including accompanying his father on visits to Bute docks. He also learnt to speak Welsh. Crichton-Stuart later chose to enter the army and was commissioned in 1903 into the 3rd Battalion of the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders and then served for two years in the 1st Battalion, the Scots Guards as a 2nd lieutenant. Marriage, philanthropy and political career Crichton-Stuart in a photograph published The Illustrated London News on 17 December 1910 following his election In 1905, Crichton- Stuart met the Honourable Ismay Preston, the only daughter of Jenico Preston, 14th Viscount Gormanston and Georgina Jane Connelan, at the wedding of his brother John Crichton-Stuart and Augusta Bellingham where he was best man and Preston was a bridesmaid. The couple announced their engagement in January 1906 and married six months later, on 16 June, at her family estate at Gormanston Castle. Following their marriage, Crichton-Stuart transferred into the Army Reserve and decided to enter politics in order to be closer to his wife and manage his family's estate in Falkland, Fife. Crichton-Stuart first served on Fife County Council in his native Scotland and took a keen interest in local agriculture, becoming president of Fife Agricultural Society. He was later named as a member of a committee appointed by the president of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries to study the rights of tenant farmers when their land was sold or their landlords died. Crichton-Stuart also held the office of Justice of the Peace (JP) for Fife. Crichton-Stuart's family had a history of serving in parliament for the Cardiff area, his great uncle Lord Patrick Crichton-Stuart having held the post on two occasions. In August 1907, at a meeting of the Cardiff Conservative Association, Crichton-Stuart was invited by Herbert Cory and his supporting panel to be the Unionist candidate for the United Boroughs of Cardiff, Cowbridge and Llantrisant. Soon after his selection, he and his wife had their first child, named Ninian Patrick Crichton-Stuart, on 31 October 1907. Lord Ninian's campaign for election was based on reform of the poor law and extending the age range of the old age pension. He also stated of his desire of preserving and strengthening the military forces of Britain. He lost the election to Liberal candidate David Alfred Thomas in January 1910 but did manage to reduce the majority by half from the previous election in 1906. Despite his defeat, his popularity among voters was increasing and at the end of the election campaign a crowd of thousands of people came to see Crichton-Stuart and his wife travel to the train station. The crowd gathered outside the Angel Hotel where the couple were staying and, when they left, their carriage was pulled by around 60 volunteers. The procession stopped briefly outside Cardiff Conservative Club where Crichton-Stuart shook hands with numerous people and gave a short speech before continuing to the station. The Evening Express remarked on the procession, stating \\"never before has a parliamentary candidate, victorious or defeated, been so honoured by the people of Cardiff\\". On the polling day, Lord Ninian's son caught a chill being driven around Cardiff and later died. He was buried near Falkland Palace in Fife. Crichton-Stuart and his family did not permanently reside in Cardiff until he and his wife moved there in April 1910, moving into Penylan Court which had previously been the residence of William Tatem, 1st Baron Glanely. A second election was held in December 1910 following a hung parliament, in which Crichton-Stuart was successful, taking the seat from the Liberal candidate Clarendon Hyde, with a majority of 299 votes, a turnaround of 1,800 votes in the space of ten months. With a history in the military, the majority of the issues he raised before parliament concerned the armed forces, including the high costs officers were faced with during manoeuvres and a petition to improve the weaponry provided to the British cavalry units. Crichton-Stuart became a well-known figure in Cardiff and was instrumental in promoting sport in the area. A keen sportsman himself, being proficient in shooting, fishing and motoring, he stabled horses in Cardiff and entered them into steeplechase competitions and races at Ely Racecourse. In 1910, Cardiff City Football Club had secured the lease of a plot of land in order to build a new stadium. During development, one of the guarantors for the club pulled out and Crichton-Stuart instead offered his support of the project and acted as a guarantor for the ¬£90 annual rent that the club had agreed to. In recognition of his role in the building of the ground, the club dropped the original planned name of the ground, Sloper Park, and instead named it Ninian Park. The ground was officially opened on 1 September 1910 and Crichton-Stuart performed the kick-off for a friendly match between Cardiff and Football League First Division side Aston Villa. He was also a patron of the Lord Ninian Stuart Cup, a competition for local football teams. First World War Crichton-Stuart from the Roll of Honour published in The Illustrated London News on 16 October 1915 On 9 March 1911, Crichton- Stuart was promoted as lieutenant-colonel of the 6th (Glamorgan) Battalion, The Welch Regiment and took command of the battalion the following year. It was an experienced unit, being the oldest Swansea volunteer corps, that were often used as a guard of honour during royal visits and Crichton-Stuart's wife Ismay chose the battalion colours of scarlet, silver and green. Following the outbreak of the First World War, he volunteered his battalion for service and they were shipped to France as part of the British Expeditionary Force, with 812 troops, 30 officers and 500 horses, becoming one of the first territorial battalions to join the war. At the battalion drill hall in Swansea prior to their departure, Crichton-Stuart addressed the unit, stating \\"The greatest honour a man can receive is that he has been provided with a chance to give, if need be, the greatest that he has, which is his life, for his country. I do not doubt every man on this parade will give it and give it as willingly as I mean to give it myself.\\" On their arrival on the Western Front, the 6th were initially used to support lines of communication for guard and fatigue duties, first in Boulogne-sur-Mer before moving to Saint-Omer. The posting greatly frustrated Crichton-Stuart who was eager to join the fighting. In July 1915, they were transferred to the front and took part in operations at Heuvelland where they were labelled \\"the lucky 6th\\" by other units due to their relatively low number of wounded and Crichton-Stuart gained a reputation as a leader who was \\"always concerned with the welfare of his men\\". Death On the night of 1 October 1915, during the Battle of Loos, the 6th Battalion was part of a force that successfully charged and captured a set of enemy trenches at the Hohenzollern Redoubt, near La Bass√©e, despite suffering heavy losses. Prior to the battle, the 6th had not slept for two days and had marched for 16 hours to reach the location. The following morning, the German troops launched a counter-attack to retake the trenches and the two Welsh battalions that were holding them were split from each other. Crichton-Stuart ordered the digging of a sap trench in order to reach the other units but prolonged attacks from three sides left the unit short of ammunition and other supplies and the order was given to abandon the trench and retreat. During the start of the evacuation of the trench, he was shot in the head by a German sniper after firing his revolver over the trench parapet and died at the age of 32, the only serving Welsh MP to be killed during the conflict. His body was returned to battalion headquarters and placed in a zinc-lined coffin in a church in the town of Sailly-Labourse. The coffin was held in the church vault until spring 1918 with the intention of returning it to Britain at the end of the war but a German artillery bombardment damaged the vaults and his body was buried in the grounds of the B√©thune Town Cemetery in a Catholic ceremony. Several reports state that he may have been attempting to rally his troops in order to mount a search party to locate his close friend Major Reginald C. Browning, who was last seen in a trench that had been overrun by German troops. An officer in his regiment reported that Crichton-Stuart \\"was to be found wherever danger threatened\\" and that his death had \\"cast a gloom\\" over the battalion. Crichton-Stuart had served for eleven months on the front line before his death. Of the 842 members of the 6th Battalion that had begun the war, only 30 survived. There was an outpouring of grief when his death was announced and his wife Ismay received numerous letters of condolence, including one from Margaret Lloyd George, the wife of David Lloyd George. On 30 April 1917 Crichton-Stuart's widow, Ismay, married Captain Archibald Henry Maule Ramsay (4 May 1894 ‚Äì 11 March 1955), later a Scottish Unionist MP for Peebles and South Midlothian 1931‚Äì1945. Together they had four sons. Ismay died on 16 February 1975 aged 92, and was survived by six of her eight children. Legacy Crichton-Stuart is commemorated on Panel 8 of the Parliamentary War Memorial in Westminster Hall, one of 22 MPs and officers of the House of Commons who died during the First World War to be named on that memorial. Crichton-Stuart is one of 19 MPs who fell in the war who are commemorated by heraldic shields in the Commons Chamber. A further act of commemoration came with the unveiling in 1932 of a manuscript-style illuminated book of remembrance for the House of Commons, which includes a short biographical account of his life and death. A statute of Crichton-Stuart was commissioned soon after his death. Sculpted by Sir William Goscombe John, the statue was placed in Gorsedd Gardens in Cathays Park and depicts Crichton-Stuart in military uniform with binoculars in his right hand and papers in his left in a design intended to show him surveying the battlefield. Ninian Road in Roath Park, one of the Bute estate developments from the early twentieth century, continues to bear his name. Ninian Park maintained its name until it was closed and demolished in 2009 following the construction of the Cardiff City's new ground, the Cardiff City Stadium, although one side of the new ground was named the Ninian Stand. A housing estate was built on the site of the former ground and retained the name Ninian Park. The nearby Ninian Park railway station and Ninian Park primary school also bear his name. A chapel commissioned to be built on the family estate in Falkland as a memorial to Crichton-Stuart's son who died at the age of two still stands partially built after work was abandoned following Crichton-Stuart's death.

The company has 35 owned offices and clients in 60 countries. House Investigation In September of 2020 the House Committee on Oversight and Reform release a report outlining how Porter Novelli used tax payer funds to promote CMS Administrator Sema Verma. The report details how Porter Novelli shuffled money to private Republican political operators including Nahigian Strategies, Pam Stevens, and nearly two dozen other Republican contractors. The committee stated that Porter Novelli violated the law by funneling tax payer funds to promote a political entity via the use of private contractors. History The firm was founded in Washington, D.C., in 1972 by Bill Novelli and Jack Porter, advertising executives, who worked together to market the Peace Corps. The company's first major client was the National Institutes of Health, for whom they created the National High Blood Pressure Education Program. In 1981, an advertising agency in Chicago called Needham Harper Steers acquired Porter Novelli, turning the agency into Needham Porter Novelli, with offices in additional cities. Needham merged with Omnicom in 1988, at which point Porter Novelli expanded internationally. The firm established Porter Novelli International in 1996, partnering with UK firm Countrywide Communications Group, another Omnicom agency. Helen Ostrowski became CEO of the company in 2001, the first female CEO of a top 10 PR firm; she served in that role until 2008. In 2006 most of the company's revenue came from the Information technology sector, followed by the pharmaceutical sector. The company formed a new business unit in 2006 dedicated specifically to the biotechnology industry. From 1988 to 2016, Hewlett-Packard was a major client of the firm, including when Hewlett-Packard split into HP Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise in 2015. Among the firm's clients in 2008 were the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities, Navy Federal Credit Union, FDIC, Johnson & Johnson Corporate Communications, and Blockbuster Video. The company created a Jack + Bill \\"popup agency\\" in September 2008 led by eight younger Porter Novelli employees. In 2008 several senior managers left along with Ostrowski, and Gary Stockman was made CEO. In 2011, Porter Novelli acquired Silicon Valley-based Voce Communications. That same year, several senior executives left the firm, including its global digital director, director of global health and regulatory affairs, executive VP for strategic planning and research, senior VP for global digital and PR and its executive VPs for global content director and social media. Departures continued in 2012 with departures of Stockman, the CFO, the chief marketing officer, and the president. Karen van Bergen was selected as the new CEO in December 2012. Brad MacAfee then became CEO in February 2016, when van Bergen rose to the role of CEO of parent Omnicom Public Relations Group. In 2017, Omnicom shifted Cone Communications under Porter Novelli, although Cone retains its separate brand. In 2018, Porter Novelli launched a \\"purpose practice\\" for organizations focused on corporate social responsibility. The company has also conducted research on how advertising that features a brand's purpose affects consumer perception. Notable campaigns Porter Novelli has received attention for campaigns including an HIV prevention campaign for the Centers for Disease Control, the USDA MyPyramid food guidance system, the M&M;'s Global Color Vote, and the Almond Board of California's \\"Carpe PM\\" campaign. In 1998, the firm launched Florida's anti-tobacco \\"Truth\\" campaign, which expanded nationally two years later. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute in 2009 gave the firm a three-year contract to support its \\"Learn More Breathe Better\\" campaign for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease awareness. In 2015, Porter Novelli helped facilitate the Ice Bucket Challenge with the ALS Association, and guided the campaign to receive more national and international media attention. Porter Novelli was hired by the Indiana Economic Development Corporation, designated with the task to attract businesses to the state, to rebrand Indiana's image after backlash from the Religious Freedom Restoration Act signed into law in March 2015. The state considered eight other firms before selecting Porter Novelli. The state rejected Porter Novelli's suggestions of sponsoring the Silicon Valley Pride Festival or content in Pride Magazine. The firm was fired after only three months.Porter Novelli, Gov. Mike Pence Tight-Lipped on ‚ÄòReligious Freedom‚Äô Relationship Adweek, 2015 Since 2015, Porter Novelli's clients have included Bayer Crop Science and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Between 2017 and 2020, Porter Novelli earned more than $5 million in taxpayer funds to promote the public profile of Seema Verma, a Trump administration official.

Background  The success of the Electric Prunes' single, \\"I Had Too Much to Dream (Last Night)\\", which charted at number 11 in the U.S. and at number 49 in the UK, prompted the band to tour more and to record adverts. The band was featured in publicity photos for the November 1967 issue of Teen Pin- Ups. They also recorded an advert for the Vox wah-wah pedal and promoted use of the equipment in the Vox Teen Beat magazine. Following the band's extensive promotional campaign, a second single, \\"Get Me to the World on Time\\", was released and charted at number 27 in the U.S. With the band having a busy touring schedule, the recording of the album was hurried in an effort to cash in on their recent success. The band was already composing material for what they hoped would be an album of their own design. However, much of the album's content was out of their control as producer Dave Hassinger brought in the songwriting team of Annette Tucker and Nancie Mantz. They, alone, produced seven of the 12 tracks, much to the frustration of the band. Mark Tulin and James Lowe, the band's main songwriters, were limited to just one track, the song \\"Luvin'\\". The band considered some of the tracks just as filler and were disappointed in not having a choice in disclosing them.

It was intended to substitute four VVER-440 V230 reactors of the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant that were decommissioned as a prerequisite for Bulgaria to join the European Union. On June 11, 2010, the Bulgarian government announced that it would freeze indefinitely the planned construction of the Belene nuclear power plant because it was uncertain when the investment would be returned.http://www.sofiaecho.com/2010/06/11/915612_bulgaria-scraps-bourgas- alexandroupoulis-pipeline-shelves-belene-nuke-pm Five months later, on December 2, a non-binding memorandum of understanding was signed between NEK EAD, Rosatom, Altran and Fortum, setting up a 6.3 bln. euro price on the power station, after months of unsuccessful talks on the cost and redeemability of the project itself.Shareholder memoranda to build Bulgaria's Belene nuke signed, The Sofia Echo, 2 December 2010 Further disagreement and the persistent demands of the Bulgarian government to lower the cost under 5.0 billion euro led to the termination of the project in March 2012. However, in late 2012 the opposition initiated a referendum petition which was signed by 1,385,283 people and the first national referendum in the history of modern Bulgaria was held on January 27, 2013. A majority of the people had voted ‚Ä≤Yes' to the construction of a new nuclear power plant, but despite that, the number of voters who attended the voting was too low for it to pass. The referendum passed the question further to the Parliament, which decided on 27 February 2013 to suspend it.Bulgarian Parliament Confirms Decision to Scrap Belene N-Plant, Novinite, 27 February 2013 In June 2018 the Bulgarian Parliament voted to abolish the moratorium on the construction of the power plant and in December 2019 Minister of Energy announced that five companies placed bids and have been selected as prospective strategic investors in the project.Bulgaria invites Russia, China and S. Korea to invest in its nuclear project History=Early project The discussions on constructing a second nuclear power plant started in the early 1970s. The Belene site was approved for the construction of a second Bulgarian NPP by a Council of Ministers decree on 20 March 1981. The site was handed to the Ministry of Economics on 31 December 1981 and the documentation for the construction site's preparation was prepared in late 1980 and early 1981 by Energoproekt Sofia. The site's preparation in accordance with the draft projects began in the early 1981. The foundations of the future power plant were laid in 1987 after the design of Atomenergoproekt Kyiv from the USSR and Energoproekt Sofia. The design suggested the construction of four VVER-1000/V 320 reactors. Between 1988 and 1990 40% of the construction work of reactor 1 was finished and 80% of the equipment was supplied. The project was abandoned in 1990 due to the restoration of capitalism in Bulgaria and only conservational work was done. Since then, measures have been continuously undertaken to preserve the supplied equipment, the construction site and the buildings; various investigations and assessments have been carried out with respect to the site suitability and the equipment status, all of which yielded positive conclusions. New investigations have been performed in relation to site safety and its compliance with international requirements. There has been particularly extensive research on the seismic safety of the chosen site. A number of missions were carried out by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other bodies of authority. All these came up with positive conclusions and confirmations that the Belene site is suitable for the construction of a nuclear power plant. Restart In 2002 the Government decided in-principle for a restart of the Belene Project. Fulfillment of all legislative requirements allowed the Government to approve the construction of a nuclear power plant on the Belene site with total rated capacity of 2000 megawatts. The Ministry of Energy began to renew the available equipment and examine the possible construction of the new nuclear plant. In February 2003 Minister Milko Kovachev sent letters to six leading companies in the sphere of nuclear energy asking them to provide up-to-date technical, economic and financial information regarding the project. A working group of experts was formed by an order of the Ministry of Energy and Energy Resources of 27 May 2003, which included experts from the Ministry of Energy and Energy Resources, the Ministry of Environment and Waters, the Ministry of Transport and Communication, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Health, the Nuclear Regulatory Agency, the State Energy and Water Regulatory Commission, the State Agency for Civil Protection, the National Electric Company and BulAtom. A programme for the expert commission's work was approved on 4 July 2003. Pursuant to the above-mentioned decision, on May 10, 2005, the National Electric Company launched a procedure for selection of a Contractor for the engineering, procurement, and commissioning of Belene Nuclear Power Plant, Units 1&2\\\\. In late October 2006 the offer of the Russian Atomstroyexport, the French Framatome (Areva), and the German Siemens using third-generation VVER-1000/V-446B reactors was approved by the National Electric Company. The offer was selected due to the highest safety level guaranteed by several new independent active and passive safety systems, as well as the option for Atomstroyexport to buy back the old unit supplied in the 1980s. Another reasons was the 60-year operation term. According to the Atomstroyexport president, the first unit would be in operation by 2013 and the second a year later. On 7 December 2007 the European Commission gave its favourable opinion to the NPP, saying that it met all requirements of articles 41 to 44 of the Euratom Treaty. A favourable opinion of the EC is one of the requirements for a Euratom loan. On 18 January 2008, Atomstroyexport and Bulgaria's National Electric Company (NEC) signed the contract for the design, construction and installation of units 1 and 2 of the Belene NPP. On 3 September 2008, the construction of the Belene NPP officially started. According to the Minister of Energy Petar Dimitrov, the Belene plant would operate \\"the most secure reactors existing in the world\\"; he also asserted that \\"the chance there would be a failure in those reactors is practically zero\\". Prime Minister Stanishev and Minister Dimitrov also called the project \\"a Renaissance for Bulgaria's nuclear energy\\" and \\"the largest industrial project in Bulgaria in the last eighteen years\\". More than 10,000 construction workers would be employed in the project, with the first reactor expected to be operating by the end of 2013, the second by the end of 2014. According to the schedule, Unit 1 of the A92 design has to be erected for 6.5 years and Unit 2 for 7.5 years with consideration of the specific licensing terms as per the Bulgarian legislation. The longest time-consuming activities are related to the design work and equipment delivery (58 months), as well as to the very construction and installation (51 months).  Termination of the project  The negotiations stalled again after the GERB government decided to add an American or a European contractor to the project, as well as insisting for Atomstroyexport to lower the price to less than five billion euro. As no major European or American investor appeared, the talks continued to yield no results. This led to the official termination of the Belene project in March 2012. A thermal powerplant using gas from the South Stream pipeline will be built on the site, and the reactor for Unit 1 will be assembled as Unit 7 at the Kozloduy NPP.Bulgaria quits Belene Nuclear Power Plant project, Novinite, 28 March 2012 In June 2016, the International Court of Arbitration awarded Atomstroyexport ‚Ç¨620 million in compensation for equipment already manufactured for the plant, which will be delivered to Bulgaria following payment.  Possible project restart  Although the project was cancelled by parliament, the Bulgarian Socialist Party government of Plamen Oresharski (elected on May 29, 2013) has spoken publicly about restarting the project. In 2016 discussions took place with Rosatom about the possibility of installing one of the reactors at Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant and selling the second one to a third party. An alternative is a privately financed completion of Belene. On 7 June 2018, the Bulgarian Parliament voted to abolish the moratorium on the construction of the power plant. The aim of the government is to complete the project through funding by a strategic investor, what interest has so far been declared by several companies. Minister of Energy should develop an investor selection procedure and propose options for structuring the project by 31 October 2018. According to the Minister, the plant can be completed within 7‚Äì8 years.The Bulgarian Parliament's Decision: Restart of the Belene NPP Project In December 2019, the Bulgarian energy ministry said it had selected five companies among the 13 applications received to participate in the project. China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC), Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power (KHNP) and Rosatom as potential strategic investors. Framatome and General Electric (GE) have also been selected; Framatome expressed interest in providing safety systems, GE offered design and supply equipment, turbines, compressors and transformers. Technical Features The AES 92 variant proposed for implementation at the Belene NPP site is a new generation VVER type reactor that has been licensed by regulatory authorities in Russia. It has been declared to meet all safety requirements as well as recommendations from the IAEA and INSAG and has been also confirmed by a special analysis of leading experts from EDF based on the recognized European Utility Requirements. This variant of the AES can make use of the two partially completed Belene NPP reactors started in the 1980s. The design directly uses a majority of the already built civil structures and facilities related to generic plant needs. Existing foundations and civil structures will be further evaluated with a view to incorporation into the new design. AES 92 Reactor Belene NPP will be a Pressurized Water Reactor design with four first-stage coolant circulation loops per reactor. Reactor nominal thermal power is 3010 MWt and electrical net power is 1011 MWe. A typical refueling process takes 14 days with annual outage of between 20-28 and 40‚Äì50 days, depending on the scope of ongoing repair works. The AES 92 Reactor Facility has a 60-year lifetime design. Being a Light Water Reactor of third generation type the AES 92 design has improved safety as well as technical and economic features. Main advantages of the AES 92 design over existing VVER nuclear power plants of the previous generation are: * Ensuring for fast and sure termination of the nuclear reaction in the reactor core thanks to two individual completely independent reactivity control systems; * Redundancy for all safety functions provided by the use of both active and passive safety systems (including a Passive Residual Heat Removal System and Passive Filtering System), which require neither operator intervention nor electric power supply; * Use of a special enclosure to contain potential accidents. This structure is composed of a primary containment of pre-stressed reinforced concrete and a leak tight metal liner, secondary reinforced concrete containment, and cast concrete external structure designed to withstand a large range of internal and external events. A specific feature of the third generation reactor presented in the AES 92 variant is the provision of a \\"core catcher\\" for severe accident cases. This insures against a containment integrity violation and release of highly radioactive substances into the environment. Improved safety in the AES 92 design accounts for projected improvements in radiation protection parameters during its operation. The calculated individual effective dose of personnel exposure for this design is 1 mSv/a, which is commensurate with the permissible annual effective dose limit for a person in the general population and in compliance with the Bulgarian normative base and European directives. As to the design dose rate per person of the greater population due to radioactive releases by the NPP: this value for the AES 92 variant is lower than 0.05 mSv/a, which represents less than 1/3 of the permissible dose rate as per article 10 of NRA's regulations ensuring the safety of NPPs. This dose is pertinent to the effect of all sources of releases at the site. The normalized annual radioactive releases are also indicative for the improved environmental impact parameters (for 1000 MW). While target criteria stipulated for the unit design was < 6.7 GBq/a for liquid releases, the design value for AES 92 is lower by one order - 0.11 GBq/a. Similarly, with target criteria below 33.3 TBq/a for the liquid releases, the design value for AES 92 is 2.9 TBq/a. Spent Nuclear Fuel (SNF) management and the Radioactive Waste (RAW) handling is an important aspect of the environmental impact assessment for the new plant. The fuel envisaged to be used for AES 92 allows for up to 50 years storage of spent fuel assemblies in a storage pool and then an additional 10 years of ‚Äúdry‚Äù storage keeping. The general plan provides for SNF transportation to Russia for reprocessing. Plasma incineration of solid wastes is envisaged for high-level waste generated during plant operation, with separate processing of liquid wastes depending on radioactivity. The anticipated total amount of conditioned wastes that will require disposal is less than 50 m3 per year for one reactor unit. Controversy There is controversy over the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), which \\"does not contain adequate information on the seismic conditions, nor does it address beyond design basis accidents or give details of the potential impacts of decommissioning\\". The World Nuclear Industry Status Report 2007 pp. 31-32. Furthermore, following legal action by environmental groups, the authors of the original EIA confirmed, in court, that it was flawed and would require a new EIA once a designer and builder were appointed. The total cost of the project is now estimated by the operator to be around ‚Ç¨7 billion (‚Ç¨4 billion for the power stations plus associated infrastructure development costs). Environmental organizations Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth (Europe), Urgewald, Bankwatch, World Information Service on Energy and the Bulgarian NGO BeleNE! oppose the plant's construction, and have expressed the following concerns:Environmental Organizations condemn European Commission Decision on Bulgarian Reactor * negative effect on the tourist industry and the agriculture of northern Bulgaria * safety concerns over the use of nuclear technology * location in a seismic active zone * the expense of the project * risk of terrorist attack * problems with the transportation, procession and preservation of the nuclear waste * complete unnecessity of further nuclear power in the first place, as better options are available. Concerns regarding the construction of the plant have mainly been felt in nearby Romania, with articles in the newspapers such as Cotidianul, Rom√¢nia LiberƒÉ and Ziarul even going as far as comparing the project with Chernobyl despite a new generation of VVER reactors is to be used, and not the cheaper graphite-moderated RBMK series like Chernobyl's. Critics say the project is economically flawed, open to corruption and mismanagement, and will cement Russian dominance of Bulgaria's energy sector.Nuclear ambitions fan controversy in Bulgaria ReferencesExternal links *Photo gallery of the Belene NPP at the National Electric Company website * Campaign against the plant's construction * Article about the project Belene Nuclear power stations in Bulgaria Proposed power stations in Bulgaria Nuclear power stations using VVER reactors Nuclear power stations with reactors under construction ","title":"Belene Nuclear Power Plant"},{"id":"6370027","text":"Pavel Petrovich Maksutov ( April 25, 1825 ‚Äì May 2, 1882) was an Imperial Russian Navy rear-admiral, prince, hero of Crimean War, 15th governor of Taganrog.

His brothers and sisters were: Nikolay, Alexander (lieutenant, heavily wounded on August 24, 1854 during the siege of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, died on September 10 of the same year, Yekaterina, Dmitri (rear-admiral, the last governor of Alaska, Pyotr and Georgy. He entered the Naval Cadet Corps in Saint Petersburg on March 16, 1838, was promoted to the rank of reefer in January 1840. In 1840-1841 he sailed in the Baltic Sea on frigates Alexander Nevsky and Kastor. January 1, 1841 promoted to the rank of midshipman. In 1842-1846 served on various ships in the Baltic Sea, and in early 1847 was transferred into the Black Sea Fleet. In 1847-1848 he participated in landing operations near Abkhazia, April 11, 1848 was promoted to the rank of lieutenant for military actions against the mountaineers during Caucasian War. In 1849-1850 served on brig \\"Theseus\\", sailed from Odessa to Constantinople and further to Aegean Sea. After return to Black Sea, in 1851-1852 served on battleship Tri Sviatitelia and on brig \\"Andromache\\". During Crimean War, Maksutov served as flag-officer by rear- admiral Fyodor Mikhailovich Novosilsky and participated in the Battle of Sinop on board the battleship Paris. For 349 days of the siege of Sevastopol (1854) he was awarded with an Order of St. Vladimir of 4th degree with ribbon, he was also promoted to the rank of captain-lieutenant and after the end of war received two Orders of St. Anna of 2nd and 3rd degrees. 1863-1876, Pavel Maksutov served as governor of Berdyansk and commander of the Berdyansk seaport. In April 1878 promoted to the rank of mayor-general of the fleet (as of January 22, 1879 renamed \\"rear-admiral\\") and served as Governor of Taganrog in 1876‚Äì1882, where he became infamous after being implicated in the so-called Valliano Affair.

This theory is the culmination of the life work of Zellig Harris, with major publications toward the end of the last century. Operator grammar proposes that each human language is a self-organizing system in which both the syntactic and semantic properties of a word are established purely in relation to other words. Thus, no external system (metalanguage) is required to define the rules of a language. Instead, these rules are learned through exposure to usage and through participation, as is the case with most social behavior. The theory is consistent with the idea that language evolved gradually, with each successive generation introducing new complexity and variation. Operator grammar posits three universal constraints: dependency (certain words depend on the presence of other words to form an utterance), likelihood (some combinations of words and their dependents are more likely than others) and reduction (words in high likelihood combinations can be reduced to shorter forms, and sometimes omitted completely). Together these provide a theory of language information: dependency builds a predicate‚Äìargument structure; likelihood creates distinct meanings; reduction allows compact forms for communication. Dependency The fundamental mechanism of operator grammar is the dependency constraint: certain words (operators) require that one or more words (arguments) be present in an utterance. In the sentence John wears boots, the operator wears requires the presence of two arguments, such as John and boots. (This definition of dependency differs from other dependency grammars in which the arguments are said to depend on the operators.) In each language the dependency relation among words gives rise to syntactic categories in which the allowable arguments of an operator are defined in terms of their dependency requirements. Class N contains words (e.g. John, boots) that do not require the presence of other words. Class ON contains the words (e.g. sleeps) that require exactly one word of type N. Class ONN contains the words (e.g. wears) that require two words of type N. Class OOO contains the words (e.g. because) that require two words of type O, as in John stumbles because John wears boots. Other classes include OO (is possible), ONNN (put), OON (with, surprise), ONO (know), ONNO (ask) and ONOO (attribute). The categories in operator grammar are universal and are defined purely in terms of how words relate to other words, and do not rely on an external set of categories such as noun, verb, adjective, adverb, preposition, conjunction, etc. The dependency properties of each word are observable through usage and therefore learnable. Likelihood The dependency constraint creates a structure (syntax) in which any word of the appropriate class can be an argument for a given operator. The likelihood constraint places additional restrictions on this structure by making some operator/argument combinations more likely than others. Thus, John wears hats is more likely than John wears snow which in turn is more likely than John wears vacation. The likelihood constraint creates meaning (semantics) by defining each word in terms of the words it can take as arguments, or of which it can be an argument. Each word has a unique set of words with which it has been observed to occur called its selection. The coherent selection of a word is the set of words for which the dependency relation has above average likelihood. Words that are similar in meaning have similar coherent selection. This approach to meaning is self-organizing in that no external system is necessary to define what words mean. Instead, the meaning of the word is determined by its usage within a population of speakers. Patterns of frequent use are observable and therefore learnable. New words can be introduced at any time and defined through usage. In this sense, link grammar could be viewed as a kind of operator grammar, in that the linkage of words is determined entirely by their context, and that each selection is assigned a log-likelihood. Reduction The reduction constraint acts on high likelihood combinations of operators and arguments and makes more compact forms. Certain reductions allow words to be omitted completely from an utterance. For example, I expect John to come is reducible to I expect John, because to come is highly likely under expect. The sentence John wears boots and John wears hats can be reduced to John wears boots and hats because repetition of the first argument John under the operator and is highly likely. John reads things can be reduced to John reads, because the argument things has high likelihood of occurring under any operator. Certain reductions reduce words to shorter forms, creating pronouns, suffixes and prefixes (morphology). John wears boots and John wears hats can be reduced to John wears boots and he wears hats, where the pronoun he is a reduced form of John. Suffixes and prefixes can be obtained by appending other freely occurring words, or variants of these. John is able to be liked can be reduced to John is likeable. John is thoughtful is reduced from John is full of thought, and John is anti-war from John is against war. Modifiers are the result of several of these kinds of reductions, which give rise to adjectives, adverbs, prepositional phrases, subordinate clauses, etc. # John wears boots; the boots are of leather (two sentences joined by semicolon operator) ‚Üí # John wears boots which are of leather (reduction of repeated noun to relative pronoun) ‚Üí # John wears boots of leather (omission of high likelihood phrase which are) ‚Üí # John wears leather boots (omission of high likelihood operator of, transposition of short modifier to left of noun) Each language has a unique set of reductions. For example, some languages have morphology and some don‚Äôt; some transpose short modifiers and some do not. Each word in a language participates only in certain kinds of reductions. However, in each case, the reduced material can be reconstructed from knowledge of what is likely in the given operator/argument combination. The reductions in which each word participates are observable and therefore learnable, just as one learns a word‚Äôs dependency and likelihood properties. Information The importance of reductions in operator grammar is that they separate sentences that contain reduced forms from those that don‚Äôt (base sentences). All reductions are paraphrases, since they do not remove any information, just make sentences more compact. Thus, the base sentences contain all the information of the language and the reduced sentences are variants of these. Base sentences are made up of simple words without modifiers and largely without affixes, e.g. snow falls, sheep eat grass, John knows sheep eat grass, that sheep eat snow surprises John. Each operator in a sentence makes a contribution in information according to its likelihood of occurrence with its arguments. Highly expected combinations have low information; rare combinations have high information. The precise contribution of an operator is determined by its selection, the set of words with which it occurs with high frequency. The arguments boots, hats, sheep, grass and snow differ in meaning according to the operators for which they can appear with high likelihood in first or second argument position. For example, snow is expected as first argument of fall but not of eat, while the reverse is true of sheep. Similarly, the operators eat, devour, chew and swallow differ in meaning to the extent that the arguments they select and the operators that select them differ. Operator grammar predicts that the information carried by a sentence is the accumulation of contributions of each argument and operator. The increment of information that a given word adds to a new sentence is determined by how it was used before. In turn, new usages stretch or even alter the information content associated with a word. Because this process is based on high frequency usage, the meanings of words are relatively stable over time, but can change in accordance with the needs of a linguistic community.

History  The Quai d'Orsay brand was created by Cubatabaco in 1973 for the French state tobacco monopoly, SEITA, and was blended with French tastes in mind, being a milder brand. There are a few competing stories as to what the marque's name refers to: one is that it is referring simply to the famous Paris avenue, another is that it refers to the French Foreign Ministry that is located on it, and another is that it is referring to the headquarters of SEITA which is also on the same avenue. Quai d'Orsay was apparently outside of the umbrella of Habanos SA for a number of years and was managed directly by Cubatabaco and SEITA, but judging by packaging, Habanos SA documents, and SEITA's merger with Tabacalera into the multi-national tobacco company of Altadis, it appears Quai d'Orsay is a part of Habanos SA like all other Cuban-made brands of cigars. Another oddity of the Quai d'Orsay line are its Corona cigars. Up until the late 1980s, Quai d'Orsay still manufactured its Coronas in two different wrapper shades: Claro and Claro Claro. As the fashion for lighter wrappers diminished (and supposedly as consumers noticed they were paying more for essentially the same cigar with the wrapper making a very minor difference) production eventually ceased of the Coronas Claro Claro. Though the box still says Coronas on it, the official production name is still Coronas Claro.

A LRIC model is often used in telecommunications regulation to determine the price paid by competitors for services provided by an operator with significant market power, usually the incumbent (former monopoly). Each of LRIC's components are analysed below. Long run Long run implies that all inputs are considered variable. In other words, even capital equipment can vary in response to a change in demand. Average LRAIC can be defined as including all the costs of services provided within an increment. In the context of telecommunications, LRAIC has often been used to set interconnection charges with the increments usually defined as the whole group of services using the core network. These services (PSTN, leased lines, etc.) include those provided by the operator with significant market power, as well as those of interconnecting operators. The costs of the network providing this wider group of services are then divided by all the traffic to produce the average incremental cost. LRIC (long-run incremental cost), in contrast, can be defined more narrowly to include the costs of adding or removing a defined quantity of traffic, or the addition or removal of a smaller set of services, such as local calls, within the broader LRAIC increment. Incremental In principle, there are an infinite number of different sized increments that could be measured. However, these increments can effectively be grouped into three different categories: 1. a small change in the volume of a particular service; 2. the addition of a whole service; or 3. the addition of a whole group of services. The first definition of the increment is equivalent to a measurable version of marginal cost, that is the cost associated with providing a very small, literally infinitesimal change in output. The second definition may apply to services of very different sizes, such as interconnection, local calls and premium-rate calls.

It only shows those which appeared in the films first. Thomas and the Magic Railroad Thomas and the Magic Railroad was the first theatrical Thomas & Friends movie. Diesel 10 Diesel 10 (voiced by Neil Crone in the film/voiced by Matt Wilkinson in the UK and the US; Misty Island Rescue onwards), is a large, cunning, darkly comedic diesel engine with a claw (which he calls \\"Pinchy\\") extending from his roof, who is Diesel's brother and successor. He was the main antagonist in Thomas and the Magic Railroad. Thomas said that he is rated \\"10 out of 10 for devious deeds and brutal strength\\". When he first came to Sodor, he hated steam engines so much that he made a goal to get rid of them once and for all. He tried to destroy \\"Lady\\", the magic engine that brings a magic railway and the steam engines alive. Although this plan failed, he was able to crash Lady causing her to be severely damaged. Her caretaker, a man called Burnett Stone, brought her back to his workshop in Muffle Mountain where he spent many years trying to bring her back to life. Diesel 10 repeatedly terrorized the steam engines and Mr. Conductor (who he nicknamed \\"Twinkle Toes\\") in an attempt to track down Lady and the Magic Railroad. Diesel 10 recruited two other diesel engines, Splatter and Dodge (who he collectively referred them as \\"Splodge\\"), to help him find Lady. However, the diesels grew tired of Diesel 10's attitude at the end of the film, and refused to help or follow him when Lady and Thomas returned to Sodor from the Magic Railroad. Diesel 10 chased Lady and Thomas until the three came to the collapsing viaduct. Lady and Thomas were light enough to make it across, but Diesel 10 was unable to stop, and the track broke under his wheels, causing him to fall off the broken viaduct and land in a barge filled with sludge below. Afterwards, he got in trouble with Sir Topham Hatt, The Fat Controller. Diesel 10 is olive-coloured with tan hazard stripes on his sides. Diesel 10 reappeared in Calling All Engines!. Diesel 10 is feared by the engines and first appears when Thomas and Percy are at the scrapyards. When they see Diesel 10, they get scared and decide to return when he's gone. Thomas tries to go to other places but leaves when he finds Diesel 10 there. In the end, Thomas goes to Diesel 10 for help to move some derailed trucks and he agrees. Diesel 10 also appeared in \\"The Great Discovery\\", \\"Misty Island Rescue\\" and \\"Day of the Diesels\\". His first appearance in an episode was in the 17th season episode \\"The Missing Christmas Decorations\\". Diesel 10's claw can be briefly seen during Rebecca's imagination in the season 22 episode \\"What Rebecca Does\\". Lady Lady (voiced by the series creator Britt Allcroft) is a violet and gold American tank engine who had magical powers. A long time ago Diesel 10 chased her, and made her have an accident. For years Burnett Stone had worked on her and kept her in his workshop on Muffle Mountain. Lady's face only appears on the Island of Sodor and The Magic Railroad. =Appearance in Calling All Engines= Lady also reappeared in Calling All Engines in Thomas' dream sequence, alongside Rusty, telling Thomas how to get the airport finished. In the Calling All Engines DVD's Character Gallery, Lady is described as \\"a magical engine. When she moves along the rails, she spreads gold dust along the rails. Lady has been known to help Thomas and his friends when there was no other engine to turn to.\\"'' Splatter and Dodge (Splodge) Splatter (voiced by Neil Crone) and Dodge (voiced by Kevin Frank) were Diesel 10's bumbling sidekicks. They were collectively called \\"Splodge\\" by Diesel 10. Although the other engines feared them, Splatter and Dodge did not have the bravery, intelligence, or villainy to match with Diesel 10. Their names refer to how their paint coats are heavily weathered. Splatter was colored purple and grey and more talkative than Dodge. Dodge was olive and grey and more intelligent than Splatter. When they were hired by Diesel 10 to help him in his scheme to rule Sodor by destroying the Steam Engines, they did not take a liking to their boss when he collectively refers to them as \\"Splodge\\" and grew impatient with them when they asked him about his scheme. As time goes on Splatter and Dodge spent their time mocking their boss and pointing out the flaws in Diesel 10's scheme causing Diesel 10 to lose his temper and cause trouble during his temper problems (Their housing collapses over them when Diesel 10 loses his temper, and Diesel 10 empties a coal barrel all over him when he tries to punish Splatter and Dodge during another temper tantrum). The two diesels grew tired of Diesel 10 at the end of the film, telling Diesel 10 to do his own dirty work as he tries to catch Lady and Thomas. Mr. Conductor Mr. Conductor (Alec Baldwin) is the railway conductor who often helps to run the railway for Sir Topham Hatt (The Fat Controller) when he is not helping out at Shining Time Station. When Sir Topham Hatt goes on holiday, Mr. Conductor travels to the Island of Sodor to take care of the engines, but runs out of gold dust, and is unable to get back to Shining Time Station and find the windmill, leaving him powerless. Diesel 10 abducts Mr. Conductor and threatens to drop him off the viaduct into the river underneath.

They did find him at the windmill, but Junior became caught on the whirling blades of it, and was flung onto the back of Diesel 10's roof. He ended up in the scrap yard, flung onto James's cab. The 2 were nearly sent into the smelting pit, until Junior used the last of his gold dust to transport them away. Junior then reunited with Mr. Conductor, and told him that their gold dust was now completely gone. When Lady returned to the Island, Mr. Conductor and Junior found their gold dust again. Junior, pleased and encouraged by his success in helping out, offers to take a job on Sodor, and was hired on as conductor so that Mr. Conductor could go back to Shining Time Station and resume working there.

It is awarded for extraordinary brave actions or extraordinary leadership during combat. A recipient deemed worthy of additional citations will receive up to an additional two swords on the medal ribbon in addition to the \\"standard\\" single sword. Additional citations are rare: Gunnar S√∏nsteby is the only person to have received the War Cross with three swords (more appropriately known as \\"War Cross with sword and two swords\\"). History The medal was established on 23 May 1941 by royal resolution of King Haakon VII, who was in London with the government in exile due to the German occupation of Norway. At that time, \\"royal\\" awards were made (to members of the British Royal family for example) and awards could be made for meritorious activities not associated with combat (extraordinary achievements or contributions for Norway's cause and war effort): these were made without the sword. The statutes were amended on 18 May 1945, restricting awards to the actions of military personnel in combat situations, thus all subsequent decorations would to be \\"with sword\\".There is some confusion, however, since it is unclear whether English language sources always make the correct with/without sword distinctions. At the same time, Haakon VII's Freedom Cross was established to replace the War Cross for civilian achievements. Awards of the War Cross ceased in 1949, but on 26 June 2009 the statutes were again revised to permit awards for actions after 1945. Recipients Since its inception, the War Cross has been awarded to 126 non-Norwegians. These awards were mostly for actions during the Norwegian Campaign of 1940.

The decision was announced by the Minister of Defence, Grete Faremo, shortly after the cabinet session the same day. Lt. Cmdr. Bolle receives the award for his actions and behaviour during his command of the Norwegian Special Operations Force Task Group II in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan's Helmand province from October 2005 to February 2006. According to the Minister of Defence, Lt. Cmdr Bolle performed \\"above and beyond the call of duty\\" on numerous occasions during this period, his leadership was described as \\"exemplary\\".

Turner Reuter, Animal & sporting artists in America, National Sporting Library (2008), p. 238 After graduating with the highest marks from the Imperial Academy of Arts and traveling in Europe under a Prix de Rome, he returned to his native Kazan, where he taught and painted. He exhibited his first work in the United States in 1910 in an international exhibition in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. After immigrating with his family to New York in 1923 and working there for a few years, Fechin developed tuberculosis and moved West for a drier climate. He and his family settled in Taos, New Mexico, where he became fascinated by Native Americans and the landscape. His best work while in the United States was of these elements. The adobe house which he renovated in Taos is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is used as the Taos Art Museum. After leaving Taos in 1933, Fechin eventually settled in southern California. Birth and early life Nicolai Fechin was born in 1881 in Kazan, Russia. As a child, he almost died from meningitis. His father was a woodcarver and gilder, and the boy learned carving from him. By age eleven, the boy was drawing designs for his father to use in the construction of altars. At the age of 13, he enrolled in the newly established Kazan Art School, a branch of the Imperial Academy of Arts in the capital of St. Petersburg. Based on his work, Fechin was admitted for further study to the Imperial Academy of Arts in Saint-Petersburg, where he studied with Ilya Repin and Filipp Malyavin. During the summer of 1904 he had an influential trip to Siberia, where he was fascinated by the landscape and native peoples. When he returned to Kazan, he often traveled outside the city to capture the rural people and places. In 1909 Fechin graduated with the highest grade possible, and his final competitive canvas won him the Prix de Rome. The traveling scholarship allowed him to visit and study in the artistic capitals of Europe in 1909. The following year he won a gold medal at the annual International Exhibition in Munich. Fechin was invited to show his work at an international exhibition at the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1910. He began to sell his work in the United States that year through W.S. Stimmel, a patron in New York. Pedagogy and career in Russia Portrait of Varya Adoratskaya (1914), State Art Museum of Tatarstan, Kazan When Fechin returned from traveling, he resumed teaching at Kazan, where he taught for ten years. He was a popular instructor. He had a less demanding style of lessons than the gruelling exercises he had been forced to complete at the Imperial Academy (source?). Among his students was Konstantin Chebotaryov. In 1910 Fechin was among the founders of the Commune of Artists. He exhibited with the Itinerants from 1912 to 1922 and with the Association of Artists of Revolutionary Russia (AKhRR) from 1922 to 1926. In addition, he designed sets and other scenic elements for the theatre from 1920 to 1922. Marriage and family In 1913, with his position at the school secure, Fechin married Alexandra Belkovitch (c. 1896‚Äì1983), the daughter of the director of the Kazan School of Art. They had a daughter, Eya (1914‚Äì2002). In 1933 they divorced and Eya lived with her father most of the time. United States The social disruption and widespread deprivation after the Russian Revolution made life difficult, and Fechin's parents died of typhoid fever. During the Russian famine of 1921 he was rescued by the American Relief Administration. In 1923 Fechin and his family emigrated to the United States, where they settled in New York. He was already well known in the States from canvases at American and European exhibitions, as well as sales. His patrons Stimmel and Jack Hunter, also John Burnham, the notable architect and a major collector of his work, helped Fechin and his family leave Russia. He soon was commissioned for new portraits and started teaching at the New York Academy of Art. He exhibited at the National Academy of Design, where in 1924 he won the first prize; in 1926 he won a medal at the 1926 International Exposition in Philadelphia. He became well known for his powerful portraits, which observers said seemed to radiate from the eyes of the subject. Some of his more renowned subjects are Lenin, Karl Marx, Frieda Lawrence and Lillian Gish. At an early age, Fechin had learned carving from his father. As an adult, he produced impressionistic sculpture, primarily from wood. At the Academy he had worked with other materials as well, but he was impatient about the processes of constructing armatures and going through seemingly endless casting cycles. He enjoyed the more direct creative process of working in wood. Southwestern United States While in New York, Fechin developed tuberculosis. Lacking effective antibiotics then, doctors recommended a drier climate for him. Fechin traveled west and in 1927 eventually settled with his family in Taos, New Mexico, which was developing as an arts center. The Taos mountains reminded him of the beauty he had seen in Siberia and he soon painted with fervor. He felt particularly close to the Native Americans, and his greatest works done in the United States were of the Native Americans. Fechin had great affection for Taos and became a naturalized American citizen while living there. The Fechins purchased a two-story adobe house, and spent several years enlarging and modifying it according to designs by Fechin. Changes included adding and enlarging windows, enlarging the porch and making the rooms more open. He also carved doors according to Russian style, created triptych windows, and carved furniture for use in the house, which reflects a combination of modernist, Russian and Native American sensibility. Sixty-eight of Fechin's works in a variety of genres can be seen at his former home, as part of the Stark Collection of the Taos Art Museum. The house is now used for the Taos Art Museum. Some of the personal spaces have been preserved. In 1979 the building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.Taos Art Museum Website, accessed May 2013 Later life Fechin stopped working on the house when he and his wife Alexandra divorced in 1933. She lived at the house until her death in 1983. Fechin returned to New York with their daughter Eya for the winter, and she lived mostly with him until her own marriage. After New York, he traveled to Southern California, Mexico, Japan, and the Pacific Islands of Java and Bali. Soon he bought a spacious house in Hollywood, but in 1948 sold it and moved into a studio in Rustic Canyon in Santa Monica. There he taught small groups of students, painted, and happily entertained guests. In 1955 he died in Santa Monica and was buried there. In 1976 his daughter Eya took his remains back to Russia for reinterment at Arskoe Cemetery in Kazan.David C.

Some of Fechin's paintings and portraits, along with his work table and easel, are on display at the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The rest of his works are displayed in different countries, with the largest collection at the Fechin Center in Kazan, Russia. In 1975 the artist/author Mary Balcomb wrote the definitive book, Nicolai Fechin, now in its third printing.

He stabilized Pasteur's vaccine against rabies so that it could be distributed to distant places. His method of producing vaccines were used in all Central European countries, and vaccine against rabies was produced according to his technology until 1989.Lontai, I.Rabies in Hungary, Romania, Moldova and Bulgaria. National Institute of Public Health, Budapest, Hungary. Biography Hempt was born on September 21, 1874 in Novi Sad (then under the Austro-Hungarian monarchy) as son of a Belgian Protestant missionary and Katarina Tewely origination from Budapest. The family soon moved to Sarajevo where he finished his primary studies. As the family was not enough wealthy for paying his studies he started studying medicine in Graz and Munich as military medic. Earned his medical diploma on the University of Graz in 1898. As an aspirant medic he started working in the same year in Vienna in the First Garrison Hospital. After that he was moved to a cavalry garrison next to Vienna. During this he married Maria Winkler in 1903. His first son was born also here in 1904. After demobilization they moved to Lukavac, where ha worked as a doctor. In Bosnia he gained experience in trying to heal different diseases including rabies. In that time Pasteur Institutes were established in Belgrade, Budapest and Ni≈°, but most of the people were not traveling to these cities, and the existing vaccination was not transportable. During World War I he was a commander of a hospital in Trieste. After that he worked in Bosnia, and in 1921 he returned to Novi Sad accepting the invitation of the Serbian Minister of Health Andrija ≈†tampar. Here he founded a Pasteur Institute and became the first director of the same. The institute was producing Pasteur's vaccine against rabies, and provided information to the people about prevention.Nikoliƒá, M. Besnilo kod ƒçoveka i ≈æivotinja.

Its longer lasting ability helped in the transportation over distances, saving many lives of humans and animals. The vaccine was produced all over Europe from 1925 to the end of the '80s, when it was replaced by modern tissue based vaccines.

Dr Imre Lentai on the symposium about rabies in 2001 in Novi Sad presented the fact, that no person vaccinated in Hungary with Hempt's vaccine was diagnosed with rabies.

According to this method the vaccination took only 6 days instead of 14‚Äì21 days of the existing methods. The other advantage was that this vaccination contained only dead viruses with sustained immunogens. Because of this, the vaccine was safe and able to be transported in glass ampules, and was also easy to use.

On every long- distance call in the United States, the customer pays for: * Origination (dial tone service): connecting the call from the originating customer's equipment to a telephone company central office or exchange). In the era of wired local telephone service (slowly coming to an end with the ubiquity of cell service, starting in the 2010s) this was usually provided by a single company in each locality. * The transportation of the signal (the call) to another telephone company office near the recipient of the call. * Termination, completing the call from the receiving company central office to the receiving subscriber's equipment. Historically, each of these steps could be carried out via a separate company, and the toll paid by the originating (or in some cases the receiving) caller would be split among the three providers. In the United States, the long-distance connection between the two local telephone company offices was furnished by the Bell System, until that was dismantled in 1984 with the mandated splitting of American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&T;) for anti-trust reasons. Since then, especially with the two largest remaining companies ‚Äì AT&T; (the same name, but quite different equipment and service) and Verizon), if the same company provides all three components it keeps the entire charge (toll) paid by the customer. Otherwise, the money received is divided; this is known as intercarrier compensation (ICC) and is intended to keep the telecommunications system functioning, by having every phone company receive compensation for the use of its network. To this day (2019) this is the system used for most international phone calls. The originating company in the originating country collects the money (except for collect calls, in which the receiver agrees to pay), keeps some for its expenses, pays some to a company which connects the two countries' networks, and pays another charge, the termination charge, to the company or government agency which connects the incoming international call to the subscriber's equipment in the destination country. While the toll for intra-country (domestic) calls is often controlled by government regulation, there is no world supervision of international call charges. The destination country company or government agency can charge anything the market will bear for its portion of the call ‚Äî sometimes this varies depending on the part of the receiving country being called ‚Äî and the originating company must collect and remit this fee to the destination country. As of 2019, there are dramatic differences between countries in the charge demanded by the receiving company for completing (terminating) the call. For example, on one network the 2019 cost of calling from the United States to the Dominican Republic is 6¬¢ ($0.06) per minute, while a connection to Cuba, a shorter distance, is 92¬¢ per minute. To some extent this reflects different costs and efficiencies in different countries, but it is used by some countries as a revenue source. In the past, high termination charges in some countries were used as a payment mechanism for phone sex services. In the best-known example, the Guyana Telephone and Telegraph Company was acquired by a U.S. company specifically for this purpose. The Guyanese were (deliberately) unable to access the phone sex lines. With the advent of cellular phone service, the basic structure did not change, but the services use different equipment than that used by the traditional networks, the companies are often different, and everything had to be renegotiated. There are often multiple providers for the originating and the termination portions of the call, since with cellular systems, in which the signal (the call) is transmitted between the customer and the central office via digital radio (before 2008, analog radio) rather than copper wire, the cost of setting up a new or competing service is far lower. In the United States, as of 2011 the termination charge for cellular calls was eliminated by federal regulation, meaning that as perceived by the consumer, there is no difference between the cost of calling a phone on a cell phone network and a phone on the traditional wired network (\\"land line\\"). In most foreign countries this is not the case, and because of the termination charges charged by the mobile networks which complete the calls, which are usually paid by the caller (\\"calling party pays\\", although in a few places receiving party pays), the cost of calling a subscriber on a cellular network can be dramatically higher than calling a land line. In some countries the charges vary depending on which of several competing cellular companies completes the call (which company the call recipient subscribes to).  Explanation  For example, a customer of Operator A wishes to call a friend who has an Operator B mobile. Operator A will charge the customer a fee per minute (the retail charge) for this call. Operator B will charge Operator A a fee for terminating the call on its network. This termination rate therefore forms part of Operator A's cost of providing the call to its customer. Termination rates may be commercially negotiated or may be regulated. A range of approaches can be used to regulate rates. International benchmarking or cost models such as a LRIC (Long Run Incremental Cost Model) or LRIC+ cost models are the most common approaches to calculate the efficient levels of termination rates. In LRIC models, the termination costs are calculated for an efficient hypothetical mobile operator. The model assumes that firms use the best technologies to provide mobile calls and services. It is a long run model as it takes into account the growth of demand, which is calculated using data on observed traffic, income and user information. It considers the time period that the service provider needs to invest in capital improvements to provide the mobile call services. Termination rates (TRs) derived from this model therefore calculate capacity costs of each element of the network, expressed in terms of per minute use. Under a pure LRIC model, costs are also calculated for an efficient hypothetical firm. The difference between both models is that while the former calculates TRs through the division of total costs by total demand, pure LRIC methodology calculates TRs by comparing a firm that provides mobile voice access and one that does not, to determine the necessary costs of providing mobile services.MTR Model Specification for Ireland . ComReg, 12 February 2016. Historically there was and in some countries still is much debate about the best level for interconnection rates. Some argue that approaches based on models do not take into account real world risks and costs and suffer, among other things, from survivorship bias (they consider that risk can be assessed by looking only at the returns of surviving companies) and therefore underestimate the true level of risk. Another concern is based on Real Options. This considers the benefit that is extinguished from the moment that an investor chooses to invest and suggests that the loss of this right to invest should be taken into account when looking at the expected returns on investments made. The fundamental principle of any telecommunications network is to allow calls originating from a subscriber A to reach a subscriber B, whether on the same network or on another network, commonly known as \\"any to any connectivity\\". In more technical terms, traffic, originating from Subscriber A is terminated at a point of destination, Subscriber B, and in order to allow for traffic to be routed and terminated between different operators, \\"interconnection\\" must be established. Interconnection allows for calls placed by a subscriber in one network to reach a subscriber in another network. Such a call is \\"terminated\\" in the destination network.  Data transfer rates  An alternative to traditional termination rates is to consider data transfer rates in conjunction with voice over IP (VOIP), which is, like the internet, a peering model. As data transfer is paid on both ends for the same VOIP call, this special form of termination is expected to gain importance. Such a model obviates the need for any regulation at a national level, other than a provision preventing mobile operators from restricting VOIP calls.Receiving Party Pays compared to Calling Party Pays  Situation in specific markets = Africa  Morocco wants to cut the termination rates by up to 70% and end asymmetric rates by 2013.Telecompaper, 2010-05-10 The Nigerian Communications Commission, responsible for the largest African mobile market with 61 million subscribers, continually lowers the termination rates.Nigeria sets new voice, SMS termination rates, 2009-12-31Nigeria posts a subscriber base of more than 61Mn, outshines South Africa‚Äôs mobile market, 2009-03-13  North America  United States = Fixed-line termination rates are below 1 ¬¢/min.

Entwicklung der Mobilfunkterminierungsgeb√ºhren Medienmitteilung vom 9 September 2010 (PDF) =United Kingdom= Termination charges in the UK are regulated by Ofcom. Maximum rates are set for a variety of number ranges including landline numbers starting 01 and 02, non-geographic numbers starting 03 and mobile numbers starting 071-075 and 077-079. The rates do not apply to landline or mobile numbers allocated in the Channel Islands or Isle of Man. Termination charges for calls to mobile numbers are reviewed every three years and annual reductions are set for the next three years. A separate set of regulations cover non-geographic numbers starting 084, 087, 09 and 118. The termination rate for mobile voice calls was set to 0.68 pence per minute in April 2015, down from more than 4 pence per minute in 2011. These cuts were in response to a campaign by the public, MPs and businesses (including BT and 3). Although fees from termination charges accounted for 14% of the revenue of mobile networks, it was argued that the cuts would allow them to become more competitive and offer cheaper packages to customers. From 1 May 2015, the cap on mobile termination rates was extended to cover calls terminating on all UK mobile providers, previously having applied only to the main four mobile providers. From 1 April 2017, the cap on mobile termination rates was reduced to 0.49 pence per minute.  Oceania Australia= Termination rates in Australia are regulated by the ACCC. The Mobile Terminating Access Service (MTAS) has been steadily reduced from 21 cents per minute (AUD) in 2004 to 1.7 cents per minute in 2016.  Mobile Termination Rates Monopoly  The calling party pays (CPP) principle is the most commonly used termination charging approach among MNOs around the world, especially in the European markets.ITU Survey, Are CPP (Calling Party Pays) services available in your country and if so, since when?, 2000 Within the CPP principle the caller has to pay mobile termination rates (MTRs) and there is no contribution from the callee. However, the callee defined the cost of the MTRs once selected the MNO to register with. This is the root of the MTRs monopoly problem. Since the early days of mobile communications MTRs considered to be a monopoly.Telecompetition, Chapter 5, Call termination - Pockets of monopoly power, 2004-09-16 However, this is a market-defined monopoly, since there is no physical limitation such as wires for reaching a mobile user. Thus, MTRs are regulated by national telecommunications regulatory bodies across the world.

Brian Potter Played by Peter Kay, Potter (nicknamed Ironside by others) is the club's owner and licensee of the Phoenix Club. After an accident involving a fruit machine, he began using a wheelchair. He is known for taking the easy option, his stingy nature with money, and general hostility towards his staff. His trademarks include picking his nose, drinking spirits from a tall vase (which allows him to reach the spirit optic) and his brown cardigan. Potter's first appearance in That Peter Kay Thing (during the episode 'In The Club') expanded on his past. Before the Phoenix, he managed three other clubs, two of which burned down while the other flooded. During the flooding, Potter (during a misguided attempt to save the night's takings) found himself pinned against the wall by a fruit machine which apparently paralysed him. The club he managed immediately before the Phoenix was called the Neptune. His attempt to rewire old Christmas lights instead of buying new ones backfired, and the resulting short-circuit saw the Neptune burn to the ground. As firefighters tried to put out the blaze, Potter was seen getting out of his wheelchair and walking, suggesting he may have been cheating to obtain sympathy and benefits. This was later described by Peter Kay as a mistake, and later episodes of Phoenix Nights suggest the paralysis was genuine. The first series of Phoenix Nights showed Potter struggling to get the club going after its grand opening, following the burning down of the Neptune. His biggest desire is to earn the right to host the finals of local club competition 'Talent Trek', (which he manages to get after falsely claiming that Jerry was dying). Despite many mishaps (which include hiring a Das Boot German-speaking fruit machine, booking a racist band for the grand opening, getting a horse drunk during a western night and hiring a psychic who insulted the audience), the Phoenix did indeed become successful, only for local rival Den Perry to drop a cigar into a waste bin. The resulting fire burnt out the majority of the club, thanks in part to Brian not putting batteries in the smoke alarms. The second series concerns Brian trying to get back on his feet following the fire, only for him to be blacklisted by the brewery as well as getting his alcohol licence revoked. Eventually he worked out a way to get around his licence ban, by appointing Jerry as licensee (knowing he could be easily manipulated) while buying alcohol wholesale to serve to customers. Despite the usual blunders, the Phoenix once again thrived under pressure. Like many of Peter Kay's main characters, Potter is often cast in an unsympathetic light. He is extremely stingy with money, refusing to take out any kind of insurance on the club or follow basic fire safety procedures. Although he does care about his staff, he doesn't think twice before using them to get what he wants, as his ultimate ambition is to see the Phoenix thrive. He also doesn't hesitate to sack Les and Alan when they are unable to act as backing band during Talent Trek (although they quickly get their jobs back when their replacements, local tribute band Right Said Frank, were caught breaking into cars during the show). When Max and Paddy returned from France with two Chinese immigrants who had stowed away in their lorry, rather than report them, Brian immediately put them to work in the kitchen. He is also willing to resort to bribery and blackmail, as he did to ensure Keith Lard gave the club a glowing review by threatening to show a manipulated picture supposedly of Keith naked with an Alsatian (knowing Keith's penchant for bestiality would ensure the picture would be believed). In the post-credits scene of In The Club, it was revealed during a trailer for the (fake) following episode that Potter could actually walk. Although Kay admitted in the commentary that this was a mistake, the first series of Phoenix Nights did have a couple of minor hints that Potter was faking his disability (for instance, in the first episode he moves from his shop mobility to his wheelchair off-screen in a matter of seconds with no assistance). He was also being investigated by the Department of Social Security for possible benefit fraud. However, in the second series Potter was trapped on his stair lift for several hours after a power cut (during which it is implied he soiled himself), eventually having to be rescued by Jerry, seemingly proving his paralysis was genuine. Jerry 'The Saint' St.Clair/Dignan Played by Dave Spikey, Jerry Dignan is the club's compere and (in the second series) the club's licensee. He uses the stage name, \\"Jerry St. Clair\\", both on and off the stage, although Brian Potter is occasionally known to refer to him by his real name. Jerry is the fall guy of the programme, receiving more than his fair share of bad luck including scalding, cancer scares and speeding fines. He suffered from illness in the first series and became addicted to herbal medication in series two. He takes great pride in organising the bingo, and his \\"Free & Easy\\" night at the club, both of which are popular with the local pensioners, as is his singing act in conjunction with Les Alanos, the club's in-house band. A recurring joke in the show is Jerry singing \\"easy listening\\", pensioner-friendly versions of recent chart hits. Although Jerry is arguably the closest the show has to a 'straight man', he is also prone to blunders. These include booking acts on the recommendation of rival club owner Den Perry, and an incident in which he got high on a mixture of herbal medication and alcohol, resulting in him losing control during a \\"Free & Easy\\" and urinating on the bar dressed as a woman before fainting. When Brian loses his licence to run the club in series 2, Jerry takes a job at Asda singing songs such as \\"Black Binbags\\" (based on \\"Forget Me Nots\\" by Patrice Rushen) and \\"Corned Beef\\" (based on \\"Call Me\\" by Petula Clark) to make money. Jerry is then unwittingly talked into becoming the \\"puppet\\" licensee, which is in truth a cover for Brian to run the club. Jerry is frequently seen chauffeuring Brian Potter to and from the club as well as to meetings in his Rover 800. He receives a driving fine after evading the police when pursued for speeding following Brian's encouragement to return to the club quickly to cover up lax fire safety precautions. Ray Von Played by Neil Fitzmaurice, Ray is a former fairground gypsy and the club's general handyman and DJ. His name ‚Äì possibly a stage name ‚Äì is a play on \\"Rave On!\\". He is one of the 'backbone' characters within the club and something of a standout among the hangers-on with his hard work and common sense. Ray first starred in series one after he helped keep the club open following a power cut by rigging the electrics up to a street lamp. He is recognisable by his 1980s clothing and mullet hairstyle, and noted for his habit of calling out \\"Shabba!\\" as a catchphrase when DJing ‚Äì no matter how inappropriate this is to the song. He was the subject of a prank played on Brian Potter by Les and Alan (the club's backing musicians), who told Potter that Ray Von had spent time in prison for killing his girlfriend, Tracy Burns. Potter fell for the story, even though it was totally out of character for Ray's easy-going, cool nature. Duped, Potter was fearful of Ray until, to his great relief, he met Tracy in person in the club. Potter referred to Ray as \\"The Yorkshire Rapper\\". Patrick 'Paddy' O'Shea Played by Paddy McGuinness, Paddy is one half of the club's doorstaff. Known for his 'cheeky chappie' image, his sex-obsessed attitude and gullible persona, Paddy tends to be quite successful with girls, unlike colleague Max. In the first series, due to some cruel remarks from other members of staff (especially Max), he was paranoid about his hair, believing he was starting to go bald (though he seemingly has a full head of hair). Maxwell 'Max' Bygraves Played by Peter Kay, Max is the other half of the doorstaff. Known for his no-nonsense approach he claims to be a serious bouncer and a bit of a hard-man, which in reality is far from the truth. He also claims to have had more life experience than he has actually had; for example, he claims to have had a stint in the army. In series two he was (unsuccessfully) employed as a hitman. Kenny 'Dalglish' Senior Played by Archie Kelly, Kenny Senior is Bolton's biggest liar. Although he says his surname is ‚ÄòDalglish‚Äô in Series 2, this claim is called into question by Brian Potter‚Äôs reaction of ‚ÄúDalglish? Where did he get that from?‚Äù Most of his statements are either vastly exaggerated or complete lies, he is something of a Walter Mitty. According to him, amongst other things he has played swingball in Pwllheli with Robert De Niro, slept with Bonnie Langford, appeared on Centre Court at Wimbledon despite being unseeded, and got Jackie Chan a price for some paint. However, there is some ambiguity about whether all of his claims are false; for example, when he claimed to have been a firefighter in Mexico, fire warden Keith Lard challenged him to speak Spanish to prove it, and Kenny did in fact speak fluent Spanish. His role within the club is unclear; however, in the first episode in series 1, he is seen on the roof, getting the lights ready, and he also sits on the club's committee. Les Campbell Les (played by Toby Foster) forms one half of the club's backing band, Les Alanos (whose name they explain comes from the two members ‚Äì \\"Les, Alan: us\\"). The resident keyboardist and drummer, he is looking for a way into the entertainment business. From playing at the Phoenix Club, to staging a play with Alan and the local youth group (based on The Karate Kid), Les strives to make it in the business. Alan Johnson Alan (played by Steve Edge) is the other half of Les Alanos, the resident organ player. Quieter than Les, he is somewhat the \\"sidekick\\" of the duo. He mixes his musical work with a job as a lorry driver for haulage company Sweet Truck Haul, meaning he has to travel to places such as Stranraer, much to Brian's annoyance. It is unclear what Alan's surname is. During the first series, he is referred to as Alan Johnson; however, in the second series, on a poster for Les and Alan's production of The Karate Kid, he is listed as 'Alan Dalton'. In the pilot episode (\\"In The Club\\", which debuted on \\"The Peter Kay Thing\\") Paddy O'Shea claims to have slept with Alan's wife, Debra. In a later episode of \\"The Peter Kay Thing\\" (\\"The Ice Cream Man Cometh\\") Alan is seen trying to purchase pornography from his local ice cream man, \\"Mr Softy Top\\". Alan explains to Mr Softy Top that he had left his wife after finding out she was having an affair with Paddy, as well as with several other men. In That Peter Kay Thing he was played by Mark Jackson. However, in \\"That Peter Kay Thing\\", Steve Edge does appear as a different character called Alan. Young Kenny Young Kenny (played by Justin Moorhouse) is a quietly spoken handyman at the club. Not seen as the sharpest knife in the drawer, he frequently misunderstands questions posed by other characters, or makes completely irrelevant diversions in the middle of conversations. He is a supporter of Manchester City, and is always seen wearing the club's shirt. From episode 8 onwards his face is permanently made up to look like a tiger, the result of a botched face- painting job at Brian's family fun day. Holy Mary Holy Mary (played by Janice Connolly) is a cleaner and member of the bar staff at the club. A devout Catholic, her kindly, hardworking nature makes her a popular addition to the club. She is often seen wearing a sky-blue Princess Diana sweatshirt. Her daughter, also named Mary (played by Sian Foulkes), a part-time worker at the club, is dating ladies-man club bouncer Paddy, something Holy Mary is not too happy about, although she puts on a brave face about it. She has an unseen son, Joseph, who is studying woodwork. Spencer Spencer (played by Daniel Kitson) is one of the bar staff at the club, whose previous bar experience includes watching the film Cocktail six times. A likable but naive young man, Spencer's first appearance in the series was as the club's DJ, before quitting after a short, disastrous spell and being replaced as DJ by Ray Von. Spencer then returned to the club as an actor, in Les and Alan's musical production of \\"The Karate Kid\\". Finally, despite not impressing at the interview, he was hired by Jerry St.Clair as a barman after revealing that his wages will be paid by the DSS. Den Perry Den Perry (played by Ted Robbins) is the owner of rival club \\"The Banana Grove\\", and is the 'bad guy' of the series. He prides himself on running the best social club in Bolton, and ruthlessly finds ways of sabotaging the Phoenix Club. At the end of series one, he sets fire to the club by throwing his cigar into a paper towel bin. Like all bad guys, though, he eventually gets his comeuppance. It is unclear what Perry's full first name is, since Brian Potter refers to him as both Dennis and Denzel. Tracey Burns Tracey Burns (played by Sally Lindsay) is a minor character and a former winner of \\"Junior Talent Trek\\". The members of the Phoenix Club's backing band, Les and Alan, tell Brian Potter she was murdered by her boyfriend, Ray Von. However, their deception is revealed when Tracy turns up with Ray at the club's \\"Singles Night\\", much to Brian Potter's amazement. Ant and Dec Ant and Dec (played by Julian Sua and Wai Kee Chan) are two illegal immigrants from Asia, who appear in the second series. They are unwittingly smuggled into the country by Max and Paddy, who are returning to Bolton after a 'booze cruise' from Calais. Despite being illegal immigrants, and being unable to speak a word of English, Brian Potter's thrifty ways soon sees them being employed as chefs at the club. Potter also christens them Ant & Dec (after the famous Geordie duo). Their cheerful nature and cooking skill (after learning not to stir fry chips), makes them a success. Other characters *Keith Winston Lard ‚Äì Peter Kay :Keith Lard is portrayed as an overzealous jobsworth who takes immense pride in his work raising awareness of fire safety through training seminars and safety inspections. He despises people's apathy and seemingly ignorant attitude toward fire safety, often scaring his bored audience with an air horn. He was accused numerous times of interfering with dogs, but was acquitted. *Dodgy Eric ‚Äì Bernard Wrigley :Dodgy Eric appears in episode 2 of both series 1 and series 2. In series 1, Eric sells a bucking bronco to Brian Potter as a replacement for a faulty snooker table. In series 2, Eric brings Brian an inflatable bouncy castle, which appears to be shaped like an erect penis when inflated, but is disguised as a snake by Eric. *Marion ‚Äì Beatrice Kelley Marion is a barmaid and chef at The Phoenix Club. She is replaced by Joyce in series 2. She is good friends with Holy Mary, and they are usually seen gossiping. Marion is a hard working member of staff who the customers like. *Joyce ‚Äì Enid Dunn *Beverley ‚Äì Jo Enright *Crimetime Host ‚Äì Stuart Maconie *Gavin 'The Captain' Gladstone (played by Ced Beaumont) is a former doorman to the club, who is known to have charged people 20p to get into the club. He only had one eye, the other having been blown out in the Normandy D-Day invasion. He died of an asthma attack in episode two of series one, following the malfunction of a smoke machine.

Lough Derravaragh sits on the River Inny which flows from Lough Sheelin on its way to the River Shannon. It is a popular lake for angling and other watersports. History There are ringforts to the east of Lough Derravaragh, within the hills of Ranaghan. Turgesius the Viking, renowned for taking Dublin, also possessed strongholds nearby, southwest of Lough Lene. Knockeyon, the hill of Saint Eyon, is located on the south-eastern shore of the lough, rising steeply to 215 metres. Halfway up the hill are the ruins of the ancient Saint Cauragh chapel, built and dedicated to Saint Eyon. The ruins of Saint Cauragh's Well are adjacent to the chapel. On the Kiltoom side of the lough mounds of stone can be found, these were part of artificial islands and gave protection to the people who lived in crann√≥gs on these islands. In the 1970s a dug-out canoe from the Stone Age was recovered from the lake by employees of the Tullynally estate. Legends=Children of L√≠r Lough Derravaragh is best known for its connection with the Irish legend of the Children of L√≠r. The legend relates how the four children of King L√≠r were turned into swans by their jealous stepmother and spent 300 years on Lough Derravaragh before moving to the Straits of Moyle (between Ireland and Scotland) for 300 years, and then spent 300 more years on the Atlantic Ocean by Erris and Inishglora. Saint Cauragh Legend tells that Saint Cauragh was expelled by Saint Columcille from the Kells monastery, for breach of discipline. Consequently, he wandered throughout the countryside until he eventually arrived at Knockeyon. At this location, far away from the eyes of the world, Cauragh desired to pass the remainder of his life praying to God and fasting. He became seriously ill at a later stage, and was dying when he prayed to God for water to quench his thirst. Having prayed for some time, he became aware of the sound of water trickling out of the rock above his head. He put out his hand and drank freely of this miraculous water. He was cured as a result, and then he built the chapel. During the Middle Ages, thousands of people visited this well on the first Sunday of harvest, undertaking the pilgrimage up the hill barefoot on what became known as Cauragh Sunday. When the pilgrimage concluded, everyone present adjourned to a green area at the foot of the hill where musicians played and everyone spent the remainder of the day picnicking, drinking and dancing. Protected areas Swans on the lake Lough Derravaragh is north of Mullingar and is part of the Lough Derravaragh Natural Heritage Area. Most of this area comprises the lake, but also it includes a variety of wetland, grassland, and woodland habitats. The site includes a small area of raised bog. The site is bound in the northwest by the River Inny. The Inny, which is a major tributary of the River Shannon, flows into and from Lough Derravaragh on its northwest shore. On this side, the lake is wide and shallow and raised bog and cutover bog are found within the immediate surrounding area (cutover bog is bog where some peat has been harvested, leaving remaining peat behind). Lough Derravaragh is shallow and its water is \\"hard\\", meaning it is alkaline. There is only a small area of raised bog on the side, but formerly it comprised a very large bog complex which extended towards the northwest of the lake. Most of this area has now been cutover and large areas have been reclaimed for agriculture. The remaining area of bog has hummock/hollow complexes but no water pools. Conifers have been planted upon the high bog and a section of cutover. Cutover is found dispersed around the high bog areas and there is also a separate small area of old cutover south of this raised bog. Much of the high bog possesses vegetation typical of an Irish Midland raised bog, with such species as ling heather (Calluna vulgaris) and hare's tail cottongrass (Eriophorum vaginatum). The hummock-forming bog moss, Sphagnum papillosum has been recorded situated around one third of the high bog as has the more scarce Sphagnum imbricatum. Overall, sphagnum covers around one-third of the high bog area. The centre of the bog is wet with stagnant water in places. The aquatic bog moss Sphagnum cuspidatum has been recorded in the hollows of the bog. There are dried-out channels of the bog which are colonised by algae, deergrass, Scirpus cespitosus and lichens. On the cutover on the southeast shore of the lake there are areas of downy birchy (Betula pubescens) woodland, with patches of gorse (Ulex europaeus). A notable feature of Lough Derravaragh, as found at Lough Lene, are the range of stoneworts that occur within the lake. Eight species have been recorded here, several of which have a restricted range in Ireland. Fringing the lake's shores, a range of habitats has been created as a result of drainage of the River Inny. At the western side are extensive reed beds and swamps of downy birch and willows. Nearby, there is also freshwater marches vegetation dominated by sedges (Carex spp.) and often tussock-forming grasses such as tufted hair-grass (Deschampsia cespitosa) and fescues (Festuca spp.), with a flowering herbs including Bidens cernua, and trifid bur-marigold. The lake shore is a mineral-rich substrate and several plant species of poor fen habitats occur in abundance, such as black bog rush Schoenus nigricans and long-stalked yellow-sedge Carlex lepidocarpa. Lough Derravaragh is also a Special Protection Area (SPA) under the EU Bird Directive (EC/79/409). Three species (Greenland white-fronted goose (Anser albifrons flavirostris), whooper swan (Cygnus cygnus), and golden plover (Pluvialis apricaria)) are listed on Annex I of the directive, requiring special conservation measures concerning their habitat in order to ensure their survival and reproduction. The rare Charophyte, Chara denundata, has been recorded in the area, while the Red List species otter (Lutra lutra) and Irish hare (Lepus timidus hibernicus) have also been observed within the lake district of North Westmeath. Water sports The lake is used for canoeing and other water activities. As in Lough Ennell, Lough Owel, and Lough Lene, the lake acts as an important amenity for anglers, as it sustains a population of brown trout.

The route of Bustamante's Atrevida was mostly the same, but deviated in some places. The Malaspina Expedition (1789‚Äì1794) was a five- year maritime scientific exploration commanded by Alessandro Malaspina and Jos√© de Bustamante y Guerra. Although the expedition receives its name from Malaspina, he always insisted on giving Bustamante an equal share of command. Bustamante however acknowledged Malaspina as the \\"head of the expedition\\" since the beginning. The expedition was funded by the Spanish government and originally pursued strictly scientific goals, in the same fashion as the voyages of James Cook and Jean-Fran√ßois de Galaup, comte de La P√©rouse. Some of the leading scientists at the time collected an impressive amount of scientific data that even surpassed what was collected during Cook's expedition, but due to Malaspina's involvement in a conspiracy to overthrow the government, he was jailed shortly upon return. Most of the expedition's reports and collections were put away unpublished, and didn't see the light until the late 19th century. Background and preparation Atrevida and Descubierta. From September 1786 to May 1788 Malaspina made a commercial circumnavigation of the world on behalf of the Royal Philippines Company. During this voyage he was in command of the frigate Astrea.Dario Manfredi, Il Viaggio Attorno al Mondo di Malaspina con la Fregata di S.M.C.¬´Astrea¬ª, 1786-1788, Memorie della Accademia Lunigianese di Scienze, La Spezia, 1988. His route went via the Cape of Good Hope and, returning, Cape Horn. Astrea called at Concepcion in Chile in February 1787, whose military governor, the Irish-born Ambrose Higgins, had six months before recommended that Spain organize an expedition to the Pacific similar to those led by Lap√©rouse and Cook.Archivo Hist√≥rico Nacional (Madrid), Estado, legajo 4289. Also at Archivo Nacional de Chile, Fondo Vicu√±a Mackenna, vol.304, D, ff.5-26. Published in Revista chilena de historia y geograf√≠a, no.107, 1946, pp.387-401. Higgins had made this recommendation following the visit of the Lap√©rouse expedition to Concepcion in March 1786, and presumably discussed it with Malaspina while the Astrea was at Concepcion. Following the Astrea's return to Spain, Malaspina produced, in partnership with Jos√© de Bustamante, a proposal for an expedition along the lines set out in Higgins' memorandum. A short time later, on 14 October 1788, Malaspina was informed of the government's acceptance of his plan. Jos√© de Espinoza y Tello, one of the officers of the Malaspina expedition, subsequently confirmed the importance of the information sent by Higgins in stimulating the Government to initiate an extensive program of exploration in the Pacific.\\"Noticia de las principales expediciones hechas por nuestras pilotos del Departamiento de San Blas al reconocimiento de la costa noroeste de America, desde el a√±o de 1774 hasta el 1791, extractada de los diarios originales de aquellos navegantes\\", Novo y Colson, Viaje, p.428; cited in Warren L.

At: http://web.viu.ca/black/amrc/index.htm The prompt acceptance of Malaspina's proposal was also stimulated by news from St. Petersburg of preparations for a Russian expedition (the Mulovsky expedition) to the North Pacific under the command of Grigori I. Mulovsky that had as one of its objectives the claiming of territory on the North West Coast of America around Nootka Sound that was also claimed at the time by Spain.Pedro Normande to Floridablanca, St. Petersburg, 16 February 1787, Archivo Hist√≥rico Nacional (Madrid), Estado, legajo 4289; copy held at Library of Congress Manuscripts Division, Foreign Copying Project Reproductions; quoted in Anthony H. Hull, Spanish and Russian Rivalry in the North Pacific Regions of the New World, University of Alabama PhD thesis, UMI microfilm, pp.113-7; and in Warren L. Cook, Flood Tide of Empire: Spain and the Pacific Northwest, 1543 1819, New Haven, Yale University Press, 1973, p.116. The Spanish government had the largest scientific budget of any European state at the time. In the last four decades of the eighteenth century, a number of scientific expeditions had crossed the Spanish Empire, including botanical expeditions to New Granada, Mexico, Peru and Chile, and making an enormous collection of the American flora. They saw the New World as a vast laboratory for study and an unending source of samples. The Spanish king, Charles III was known for his fascination with science, and had already procured funds to further develop science and technology in several areas. He promptly approved the expedition, although he would never see its results, as he died exactly two months later. Additionally, the Spanish government had a vested interest on all issues concerning the Pacific Ocean because a large number of her colonies were in that area, including most of the American Pacific coast, the Philippines, and several islands, such as Guam. Two frigates were specially designed and built for the expedition by the shipbuilder T√≥mas Mu√±oz at the La Carraca shipyard, under Malaspina's direction. They were both 306 tons burden and 36 metres long, with a normal load displacement of 4.2 metres. They were launched together on April 8, 1789 and were baptized in honor of former James Cook's ships Resolution and Discovery as Descubierta and Atrevida (a liberal translation in Spanish). Malaspina commanded Descubierta and Bustamante Atrevida. The expedition carried on board the elite of astronomers and surveyors of the Spanish Navy, headed by Juan Guti√©rrez de la Concha, with the young Felipe Bauza as cartographer. Also on board were many scientists and artists, such as painting master Jos√© del Pozo, artists Jos√© Gu√≠o, Fernando Brambila and Giovanni Ravenet, cartoonist and columnist Tom√°s de Suria, botanists Luis N√©e, Antonio Pineda and Thadd√§us Haenke, and many others. The Expedition Portrait of Alessandro Malaspina by Jos√© Mar√≠a Galv√°n The Atrevida and Descubierta sailed from C√°diz on July 30, 1789, and after anchoring for a few days off the Canary Islands, proceeded to sail across the Atlantic Ocean, to the coasts of South America. Once there, they sailed down to R√≠o de la Plata, and stopped in Montevideo and Buenos Aires, in order to prepare a report on the political situation of the Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata. Then they sailed over to the Falkland Islands, and from there they headed towards Cape Horn, crossing to the Pacific Ocean on November 13, and stopping at Talcahuano, the port of Concepci√≥n in present-day Chile, and again at Valpara√≠so, the port of Santiago. Continuing north, Bustamante mapped the coast while Malaspina sailed to Juan Fern√°ndez Islands in order to resolve conflicting data on their location. The two ships reunited at Callao, the port of Lima, in Peru, where they carried out investigations about the political situation of the Viceroyalty of Peru. The expedition then continued north, mapping the coast, to Acapulco, Mexico. A team of officers was then sent to Mexico City to investigate the archives and political situation of the Viceroyalty of New Spain. Being in Mexico, the expedition received an order from the new king of Spain Charles IV, to search for a Northwest Passage recently rumored to have been discovered, which forced Malaspina to abandon his plans to sail to Hawaii, Kamchatka, and the Pacific Northwest.; online at Google Books Instead, he sailed from Acapulco directly to Yakutat Bay, Alaska (then known as Port Mulgrave), where the rumored passage was said to exist. Finding only an inlet, he carefully surveyed the Alaskan coast west to Prince William Sound. At Yakutat Bay, the expedition made contact with the Tlingit. Spanish scholars made a study of the tribe, recording information on social mores, language, economy, warfare methods, and burial practices. Artists with the expedition, Tomas de Suria and Jos√© Cardero, produced portraits of tribal members and scenes of Tlingit daily life. A glacier between Yakutat Bay and Icy Bay was subsequently named Malaspina Glacier. Botanist Luis N√©e collected and described numerous new plants during that time. Knowing that Cook had previously surveyed the coast west of Prince William Sound and found no passage, Malaspina ceased his search at that point and sailed to the Spanish outpost at Nootka Sound on Vancouver Island. Malaspina's expedition spent a month at Nootka Sound. While at Nootka, the expedition's scientists made a study of the Nuu-chah-nulth (Nootka peoples). The relationship between the Spanish and the Nootkas was at its lowest point when Malaspina arrived. Malaspina and his crew were able to greatly improve the relationship, which was one of their objectives and reasons for stopping in the first place. Due in part to Malaspina's ability to bequeath generous gifts from his well- supplied ships about to return to Mexico, the friendship between the Spanish and the Nootkas was strengthened. The gaining of the Nootka chief Maquinna's trust was particularly significant, as he was one of the most powerful chiefs of the region and had been very wary of the Spanish when Malaspina arrived. His friendship strengthened the Spanish claim to Nootka Sound, which was in question after the Nootka Crisis and resolved in the subsequent Nootka Conventions. The Spanish government was eager for the Nootka to formally agree that the land upon which the Spanish outpost stood had been ceded freely and legally. This desire had to do with Spain's negotiations with Britain than over Nootka Sound and the Pacific Northwest. Malaspina was able to acquire exactly what the government wanted. After weeks of negotiations the principal Nootka chief, Maquinna, agreed that the Spanish would always remain owners of the land they then occupied, and that they had acquired it with all due properness. The outcome of the Nootka Convention depended in part on this pact. Malaspina Glacier in Alaska. In addition to the expedition's work with the Nootkas, astronomical observations were made to fix the location of Nootka Sound and calibrate the expedition's chronometers. Nootka Sound was surveyed and mapped with an accuracy far greater than had previously been available. Unexplored channels were investigated. The maps were also linked to the baseline established by Captain Cook, allowing calibration between Spanish and British charts. Botanical studies were carried out, including an attempt to make a type of beer out of conifer needles that was hoped to have anti- scorbutic properties for combating scurvy. The expedition ships took on water and wood, and provided the Spanish outpost with many useful goods, including medicines, food, various tools and utensils, and a R√©aumur scale thermometer. After departing Nootka Sound the two ships sailed south, stopping at the Spanish settlement and mission at Monterey, California, before returning to Mexico. In 1792, back in Mexico, Malaspina dispatched two schooners (or \\"goletas\\") to conduct more detailed explorations of the Strait of Juan de Fuca and the Strait of Georgia. These were Sut√≠l, commanded by Dionisio Alcal√° Galiano, and Mexicana, under Cayetano Vald√©s y Flores. Both were officers of Malaspina's. The ships were to have been commanded by two pilots of San Blas, Mexico, but Malaspina arranged for his own officers to replace them. In 1792, Malaspina's expedition sailed from Mexico across the Pacific Ocean. They stopped briefly at Guam before arriving at the Philippines, where they spent several months, mostly at Manila. During this period Malaspina sent Bustamante in the Atrevida to Macau, China. After Bustamante's return the expedition left the Philippines and sailed to New Zealand. They explored Doubtful Sound at the southern end of New Zealand's South Island, mapping its entrance and lower reaches but failing because of adverse weather to carry out the gravity experiments which were the reason for going there.Robert J. King, \\"Puerto del Pendulo, Doubtful Sound: The Malaspina Expedition‚Äôs Visit to New Zealand in Quest of the True Figure of the Earth\\", The Globe, no.65, 2010, pp.1-18. Downloadable at: http://search.informit.com.au. Although the expedition stayed for only a day. it left behind a unique cluster of Spanish place names, such as Febrero Point (from the month of his visit ‚Äì February), Bauza Island (after his cartographer) and Marcaciones Point (Observation Point). Then Malaspina sailed to Port Jackson (Sydney). on the coast of New South Wales Australia, which had been established by the British in 1788.Robert J. King, The Secret History of the Convict Colony: Alexandro Malaspina's report on the British settlement of New South Wales, Sydney, Allen & Unwin Australia, 1990. During the expedition‚Äôs stay at Sydney Cove, New South Wales, in March‚ÄìApril 1793, Thadd√§us Haenke carried out observations and made collections relating to the natural history of the place, as he reported to the colony‚Äôs patron, Sir Joseph Banks, saying: \\"I here express the public testimony of a grateful soul for the very extraordinary humanity and kindness with which the English in their new Colony welcomed us wandering vagabonds, Ulysses' companions. A Nation renowned throughout the world, which has left nothing untried, will also overcome with the happiest omens, by the most assiduous labour and by its own determined spirit the great obstacles opposing it in the foundation of what may one day become another Rome\\".Robert J. King and Victoria Ib√°√±ez, \\"A Letter from Thaddaeus Haenke to Sir Joseph Banks, Sydney Cove, 15 April 1793\\", Archives of Natural History, vol.23, no.2, 1996, pp.255-259. During its visit to Port Jackson, twelve drawings were done by members of the expedition, which are a valuable record of the settlement in its early years, especially as among them are the only depictions of the convict settlers from this period.Robert Langdon, \\"They Came to Spy on Sydney\\", The Sydney Morning Herald, 7 April 1962; Carmen Sotos Serrano, \\"Nuevas obras de Fernando Brambila en Londres\\", Homenaje al Profesor Hern√°ndez Perera, Madrid, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, 1992, pp.453-8.

The recently founded English colony had been included in the expedition‚Äôs itinerary in response to a memorandum drawn up in September 1788 by one of Malaspina‚Äôs fellow naval officers, Francisco Mu√±oz y San Clemente, who warned of the dangers it posed to the Spanish possessions in the Pacific in peace time from the development of a contraband commerce and in war time as a base for British naval operations. Mu√±oz said: \\"The colonists will be able to fit out lucrative privateers so as to cut all communication between the Philippines and both Americas.... These possessions will have a navy of their own, obtaining from the Southern region whatever is necessary to establish it, and when they have it ready formed they will be able to invade our nearby possessions...\\"Robert J. King, \\"Francisco Mu√±oz y San Clemente and his Reflexions on the English Settlements of New Holland\\", British Library Journal, vol. 25, no.1, 1999, pp.55-76. In the confidential report he wrote following his visit, Malaspina echoed the warning from Mu√±oz, writing of the \\"terrible\\" future danger for Spain from the English colony at Port Jackson, > from whence with the greatest ease a crossing of two or three months through > healthy climates, and a secure navigation, could bring to our defenceless > coasts two or three thousand castaway bandits to serve interpolated with an > excellent body of regular troops.

The Official Spanish Landing Plaque on Marcaciones point, Bauza Island, New Zealand While recognizing the strategic threat it posed to Spain's Pacific possessions in time of war, Malaspina wrote: \\"It is not the concern of these paragraphs to demonstrate in detail the many schemes for these projected plunderings, so much as the easiest ways of preventing them\\". He preferred the peaceable approach of drawing attention to the commercial opportunity the new colony offered for a trade in food and livestock from Chile and the development of a viable trade route linking that country with the Philippines. Having seen carts and even ploughs being drawn by convicts for want of draught animals in the colony, and having eaten meals with the colonists at which beef and mutton were regarded as rare luxuries, Malaspina saw the trade in Chilean livestock as the key to a profitable commerce. He proposed that an agreement be signed with London for an Association of Traders, and for an agent of the colony to be resident in Chile. Conscious that the policy he was proposing was a bold and imaginative one in the face of Spain's traditional insistence on a national monopoly of trade and other relations within her empire, Malaspina declared that \\"this affair is exceedingly favourable to the commercial balance of our Colonies\\", and it would have the advantage of calming and tranquilizing \\"a lively, turbulent and even insolent neighbour....not with sacrifices on our part but rather with many and very considerable profits\\".Robert J. King\\"Science and Spycraft: The Malaspina Expedition in New Zealand and New South Wales, 1793\\", Mains‚Äôl Haul, A Journal of Pacific Maritime History, vols.41 no.4 & 42, no.1, Fall/Winter 2006, pp.76-87. Also at: http://web.viu.ca/black/amrc/index.htm Returning east across the Pacific Ocean the expedition spent a month at Vava'u, the northern archipelago of Tonga. From there they sailed to Callao, Peru, then Talcahuanco, Chile. The fjords of southern Chile were carefully mapped before the expedition rounded Cape Horn. Then they surveyed the Falkland Islands and the coast of Patagonia before stopping at Montevideo again. From Montevideo Malaspina took a long route through the central Atlantic Ocean to Spain, reaching C√°diz on September 21, 1794. He had spent 62 months at sea.Lorenzo Sanfeli√∫ Ortiz, 62 Meses A Bordo: La expedici√≥n Malaspina seg√∫n el diario del Teniente de Nav√≠o Don Antonio de Tova Arredondo, 2.o Comandante de la \\"Atrevida\\" 1789-1794, Madrid, Biblioteca de Camarote ¬´Revista General de Marina¬ª, 1943 y Editorial Naval, 1988. Results of the Expedition During the five years of this expedition Malaspina fixed the measurements of America's western coast with a precision never before achieved. He measured the height of Mount Saint Elias in Alaska and explored gigantic glaciers, including Malaspina Glacier, later named after him. He demonstrated the feasibility of a possible Panama Canal and outlined plans for its construction.; online at Internet Archive In addition, Malaspina's expedition was the first major long distance sea voyage that experienced virtually no scurvy. Malaspina's medical officer, Pedro Gonz√°lez, was convinced that fresh oranges and lemons were essential for preventing scurvy. Only one outbreak occurred, during a 56-day trip across the open sea. Five sailors came down with symptoms, one seriously. After three days at Guam all five were healthy again. James Cook had made great progress against the disease, but other British captains, such as George Vancouver, found his accomplishment difficult to replicate. It had been known since the mid-18th century that citrus fruit was effective, but for decades it was impractical to store fruit or fruit juice for long periods on ships without losing the necessary ascorbic acid. Spain's large empire and many ports of call made it easier to acquire fresh fruit. The City Gazette and Daily Advertiser (Charleston, South Carolina), 19 July 1797, carried a report of the expedition: > VOYAGE OF DISCOVERY: The following particulars of the last attempt of a > voyage of discovery, which has made but little noise, and has not even been > mentioned by an English journal, cannot fail to procure attention.

Aftermath Unfortunately, Malaspina's political judgment lead him to take part of a failed conspiracy to overthrow Spain's Prime Minister Godoy, and he was arrested on November 23 on charges of plotting against the state. After an inconclusive trial on April 20, 1796, Charles IV decreed that Malaspina be stripped of rank and imprisoned in the isolated fortress of San Ant√≥n in La Coru√±a, Galicia (Spain), where he remained from 1796 to 1802, when he was finally freed at the end of 1802, although on the condition that he was exiled from Spain. It was estimated that the reports of the expedition would fill seven large volumes when published, at a cost of two million reales (250 000 Spanish dollars or about ¬£12 500). Jos√© de Bustamante attempted to have the journal and reports of the expedition published, but the cost was beyond the resources of the Spanish treasury, particularly its naval budget, during the years of strife that followed Malaspina‚Äôs arrest. There was some contemporary publication, but it took two hundred years for the bulk of the records of the expedition to be published.Pedro de Novo y Colson, Viaje politico cientifico alrededor del mundo por las corbetas Descubierta y Atrevida, al mando de los capitanes de navio, don Alejandro Malaspina y don Jos√© de Bustamante y Guerra, desde 1789 a 1794, Madrid, 1885; \\"Puerto del Pendulo, Doubtful Sound: The Malaspina Expedition‚Äôs Visit to New Zealand in Quest of the True Figure of the Earth\\", The Globe, no.65, 2010, pp.1-18. downloadable at: A large portion of the documents meant to be used as source material for the publication of Malaspina's expedition remained scattered in archives to the present day.

During his own voyage to the North Pacific of 1803 to 1806, Krusenstern surveyed the west coast of Japan in May 1805 and on his resulting chart made the generous gesture of naming a prominent cape on the coast of Hokkaido \\"after the unfortunate Spanish navigator Malespina [sic]\\" (A.J. von Krusenstern, Voyage round the World, translated by Richard Belgrave Hoppner, London, John Murray, 1813, Vol.II, p.38).

Malaspina Expedition 2010  In recognition to Malaspina's work, several Spanish institutions launched a major scientific expedition to circumnavigate the globe, that bears his name. The Malaspina Expedition 2010 is an interdisciplinary research project whose overall goals were to assess the impact of global change on the oceans and explore their biodiversity. 250 scientists were on board the oceanographic research vessels Hesp√©rides and Sarmiento de Gamboa, embarking on a nine-month expedition between December 2010 and July 2011. Following the spirit of the original Malaspina Expedition, it combined pioneering scientific research with training for young researchers, while advancing marine science and fostering the public understanding of science. The voyage covered a combined 42,000 nautical miles, with calls at Miami, Rio de Janeiro, Punta Arenas, Ushuaia, Cape Town, Perth, Sydney, Honolulu, Panama, Cartagena de Indias and Cartagena, before returning to Cadiz. The project was promoted under the umbrella of the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation's Consolider ‚Äì Ingenio 2010 programme and is led by the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) with the support of the Spanish Navy.

USS Ostara served as a commissioned ship for 13 months. Ostara (AKA-33) was laid down 13 October 1944 by Walsh-Kaiser Co., Inc., Providence, R.I. under a Maritime Commission Contract; launched 21 December 1944; sponsored by Ensign Rene Vandersloot, Navy Nurse; commissioned 31 January 1945, Lt. Comdr. Alfred St. Martin, USNR, in command. Service history On 3 February Ostara was underway for the Boston Navy Yard with a pre-commissioning crew from her sister ship aboard for training. After a shakedown cruise in the Chesapeake Bay she left the Norfolk area and proceeded, via the Panama Canal, to Pearl Harbor, where she arrived 23 March. After discharging cargo she left Pearl Harbor for San Francisco, steaming independently. On 15 April the ship left San Francisco and returned to Hawaii. Unloading and loading completed, she left Pearl Harbor 27 May for Eniwetok, Marshall Islands, arriving 4 June. The next day Ostara was underway for Saipan, Marianas Islands. Upon arrival 9 June, troops were discharged and unloading of cargo commenced. The ship then returned to the United States reaching San Diego 3 July. Loading cargo once more, Ostara left San Diego for Pearl Harbor 17 July. On 28 July she was once more underway for Eniwetok, where she arrived 6 August, fueled, and was underway for Guam 7 August. Upon arrival at Guam passengers and cargo were discharged and the ship proceeded to Saipan, where she underwent emergency hull repairs. Ostara next touched at the Philippine Islands, arriving at San Pedro Bay, Leyte, 24 August, and at Manila, Luzon, 31 August where cargo was taken on, as well as a portion of the 43rd Army Division for transportation to Japan. On 13 September Ostara moored at Yokohama Docks. While at Yokohama she safely rode out a typhoon which caused great damage in other areas. Returning to Guam 23 September Ostara moved to Saipan and then departed, with units of the 6th Marine Division aboard, for Tsingtao, China. On 11 October the ship arrived at Tsingtao, where details of Chinese coolies commenced unloading operations. Ostara arrived Manila Bay 23 October. On 1 November she left Manila for Haiphong, French Indochina, and after arriving embarked 928 enlisted men and 54 officers of the 52nd Chinese army for transportation to Chinwangtao, China. Three Chinese enlisted men died aboard of disease during the trip, despite all sanitary precautions. On 27 November Ostara anchored in Buckner Bay, Okinawa. Two days later she departed for San Diego, (Editor's note: the DANFS entry seems to be missing something here) the Panama Canal, and arrived Norfolk, Va., 23 January 1946. Here preparations for the decommissioning of the ship were begun. Decommissioning was completed 1 March 1946. Ostara was stricken from the list of naval vessels 17 April 1946. On 26 June 1946 Ostara was transferred to the War Shipping Administration for disposal at Norfolk. Assigned to the National Defense Reserve Fleet, Ostara was scrapped in 1965.

Since 1993 it has been specialising in Led Zeppelin and Page and Plant releases. Tarantura is known for its release of high quality recordings and elaborate packaging which, according to Led Zeppelin archivists Dave Lewis and Simon Pallett, often employs a \\"finesse and style unmatched even by official standards.\\"Dave Lewis and Simon Pallett (1997) Led Zeppelin: The Concert File, London: Omnibus Press. , p. 111. For example, in 1994 the label released Monsters of Rock, an elaborate 3-CD set containing the soundboard recordings from Seattle and Detroit from Led Zeppelin's 1973 concert tour of the United States. This release contained concertina-style fold-out packaging, with each disc in individual heavy stock and card sleeves. The front of the pack was designed in the style of a 1950s B-movie poster of a giant spider, \\"Tarantura!\\" Initial copies even included a jigsaw puzzle of the cover art. However, the main criticism levelled at Tarantura is that the prices charged are outside the reach of many collectors. Each title is extremely limited (usually only 300-500 sets), sometimes individually numbered, and sold through one outlet in Japan with no mail order. They are therefore difficult to obtain overseas and command extremely high prices when they do appear for sale. By way of example, the estimated value of Monsters of Rock currently stands at over ‚Ç§400. The Tarantura label can claim responsibility for some notable Led Zeppelin releases, including the 19-CD box set A Week For Badgeholders which captures the six shows performed by the band at the Los Angeles Forum during its 1977 concert tour of the United States. It has also released sets from the band's two performances at Knebworth in 1979, their entire 1972 Japanese tour, and every show from their 1980 tour of Europe.

From 1955 through 1962, the TWA Moonliner was part of the first futuristic exhibit located in Disneyland's Tomorrowland. It was also an early example of modern product placement advertising by TWA's Howard Hughes teaming up with Walt Disney as the Moonliner's sponsor. At tall, it was the tallest structure in the theme park, taller than the Sleeping Beauty Castle. Adjoining the rocket was the \\"Flight to the Moon\\" attraction, which later became \\"Mission To Mars\\" in 1975. The Moonliner was designed by John Hench, one of the original Disney Imagineers, with the help of German rocket scientist Wernher von Braun. It resembled von Braun's V-2 rocket design but depicted what a commercial spaceliner might look like for traveling to the Moon in the faraway year of 1986. The Moonliner's retracting landing leg covers were said to resemble the fuselage shape on TWA's elegant Lockheed Constellation airliner; the rocket also featured portholes, a raised cockpit area, and a boarding ramp. A real Moonliner was envisioned to be powered by a nuclear reactor and actually be more than tall; the theme park's Moonliner was roughly a one-third scale model. After Hughes sold his interest in TWA, the airline dropped their corporate sponsorship; the rocket then became the Douglas Moonliner when the Douglas Aircraft Company became its sponsor. This new Moonliner looked the same as the original, but the famous all-red TWA logo and stripes on the nose and landing legs were gone, replaced by a brand new paint scheme of overall white with blue stripes and a red, vertically stacked Douglas logo running down the rocket's fuselage. The Douglas Moonliner stayed at the theme park for five more years, until 1967, when it was removed for a redesigned, New Tomorrowland, making way for the Carousel of Progress and other attractions. Its fuselage was moved to a storage \\"boneyard\\" area at the northwest corner of the property and was seen there as late as 1981. TWA Moonliner II In 1956 Hughes added a version of the Disneyland Moonliner, known as the TWA Moonliner II, atop the southwest corner of the TWA Corporate Headquarters' Building, located at 18th Street and Baltimore, near downtown Kansas City, MO. When Hughes and Disney ended their business partnership in 1961 after Hughes sold TWA, the airline's management removed the Moonliner II from its roof and sold it in 1962 to a local RV company called SpaceCraft. SpaceCraft moved the now all-white Moonliner in 1970 to Concordia, MO, where it landed near the south side of Interstate 70, between Kansas City and St. Louis, MO, where SpaceCraft operated its assembly plant; it slowly rusted on that spot for more than 25 years. In 1997 a Columbia, MO lawyer, who collected Disney memorabilia, bought the deteriorating Moonliner II and then began a long, careful restoration process, eventually bringing it back to its 1956 condition and sporting its original red and white TWA paint scheme. The rocket is currently on loan to the National Airline History Museum at the Charles B. Wheeler Downtown Airport, in Kansas City, MO, where it stands very near an original, fully restored to flight status, TWA Super \\"G\\" Constellation airliner; the Moonliner II is located about five miles from its original TWA rooftop location. The Moonliner III Moonliner III In 1998 a new but scaled-down version of the park's original Moonliner was added as part of the New Tomorrowland, complete with the familiar red stripes of the now defunct TWA. Today, this one-third smaller Moonliner is used to promote Coca-Cola \\"Delivering Refreshment to a Thirsty Galaxy\\"; it sits next to the building that once housed the \\"Flight to the Moon\\" attraction, which is now Redd Rockett's Pizza Port. Moonliner IV (Moonliner II replica) TWA Moonliner IV atop the southwest corner of the restored TWA Corporate Headquarters building in Kansas City, MO. In early 2005, the Nicholson Group, a Kansas City, Missouri urban development firm, hired local architectural firm, el dorado inc, to design and oversee the historic restoration of the TWA corporate headquarters building, complete with a replica Moonliner II. The Bratton Corporation was contracted in early 2006 to fabricate a brand new TWA Moonliner II replica for the building's roof. This new, fully illuminated rocket was completed and then installed on September 29 of that year at the very same southwest corner roof location as the original Moonliner II. The TWA building was then leased to Kansas City- based advertising agency Barkley, Inc., and the agency moved in on November 14, 2006. The area surrounding the TWA building is known as Kansas City's Crossroads Arts District.

John Fletcher Moulton, Baron Moulton, (18 November 1844 ‚Äì 9 March 1921) was an English mathematician, barrister and judge. He was a Cambridge Apostle. Early life Moulton was born in Madeley, Shropshire, England, as one of six children of a scholarly minister of the Wesleyan Methodist Church, James Egan Moulton. He was sent to Kingswood School at the age of 11 where he excelled at academic subjects. He achieved the top marks in the Oxford and Cambridge Local Examinations and achieved a scholarship to St John's College, Cambridge, graduating Senior Wrangler in 1868 and winning the Smith's Prize. He was at one point judged to be one of the twelve most intelligent men in the United Kingdom. Career After a brilliant mathematical career at Cambridge and election to a Fellowship, Moulton became a London barrister, specialising in patent law. He also experimented on electricity and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. A great advocate for medical research, he was the first chair of the Medical Research Council. He was awarded the French Legion of Honour for his work in establishing international units for measuring electricity. Moulton became a Liberal Party Member of Parliament successively for Clapham 1885‚Äì86, South Hackney 1894‚Äì95, and Launceston 1898‚Äì1906. He backed the attempts of Gladstone to solve the problems in Ireland through Irish Home Rule. In 1906 Moulton was made Lord Justice on the Court of Appeal and Privy Councillor. In 1912 he entered the House of Lords with a life peerage and the title, created on 1 October, Baron Moulton, of Bank in the County of Southampton. The First World War gave Lord Moulton his greatest challenge. In 1914 he became chairman of a committee to advise on the supply of explosives, a difficult problem because the British had only a feeble organic chemistry industry. Before long Moulton became Director-General of the Explosives Department, first in the War Office and later in the Ministry of Munitions. He mobilised a brilliant group of administrators and scientists who expanded production more than 20-fold‚Äî throughout the war there was more explosives than shells to hold them. They also made fertilizers, and in 1917 became responsible for producing poisonous gases. Though loyal to orders, Moulton believed that poison gas was a departure from civilised warfare. During the entire four war years Lord Moulton worked a ten-hour day and took less than ten days holiday. On weekends he drove about the country to inspect munitions plants and to locate sites for new ones. He was awarded the Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 1915, the Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire in 1917, the Etoile Noir of France, the Order of Leopold (Belgium) and was the last person to receive the Order of the White Eagle before the collapse of the Russian monarchy. Moulton also corresponded with Charles Darwin.Darwin Correspondence Project After the war, despite pressure to lead the expansion of the British chemical industry, he returned to his love: the law. He died in London on 9 March 1921. In July 1924, The Atlantic published an impromptu speech Lord Moulton had given at the Authors' Club in London a few years prior to his death: \\"Law and Manners.\\"Law And Manners In it, he addresses \\"the domain of Obedience to the Unenforceable.\\"  Family  He married Clara Thomson n√©e Hertz (widow of Robert William Thomson) on 24 April 1875.

It took over a decade before the first Finnish film was produced and screened in 1907. After these first steps of Finnish cinema, the progress was very slow. After 1907 there were two periods (1909‚Äì1911 and 1917‚Äì1918) when no Finnish films were produced. This was partly caused by the political situation, as Finland held a status as an autonomous part of the Russian Empire and was thus influenced by the worldwide political situation. In 1917 Finland became an independent country and in 1918 there was a civil war. After the political situation had settled and stabilized, Finnish society and its cultural life began to develop. This was very clear with cinematic arts. More films were produced and they became an important part of Finnish society. The culmination of this development came soon after the silent era, around the 1940s and 1950s, when three major studios were producing films and competing for the market. When society changed in the 1960s, partly because of political trends and partly because of new forms of entertainment, like television, the appeal of films was threatened, practically all studios were closed, and films became political and too artistic for the masses, as commercial production was considered a thing of the past and distasteful. Few filmmakers were opposed to this development, and kept producing popular films that were bashed by the critics but loved by the people. A revival in Finnish cinema came in the 1990s, which was partly influenced by the new generation of filmmakers bringing in new ideas, and partly because commercial success was no longer considered to be \\"non-artistic,\\" thus commercial film projects started to receive support from governmental funds. In the 2000s the Finnish cinema is alive and well, with some films and filmmakers gaining global success and many films receiving a good response from audiences and critics. Today, around 15‚Äì20 Finnish full-length feature films are produced every year, and the Finnish cinema is gaining new forms from global influence, such as action and wuxia. The majority of Finnish movie theaters are owned by the company Finnkino. History=1896‚Äì1920: Before Independence The Lumi√®re company screened the first moving images at Helsinki in 1896, but it wasn't until 1904 that the first films were actually filmed in Finland. It is unknown who made the first film (called Novelty from Helsinki: School youth at break), but it was shown by American Bioscope in December. The first Finnish film company, Atelier Apollo, was founded in 1906 by engineer K. E. St√•hlberg. It produced mainly documentary shorts, but also the first Finnish feature film, The Moonshiners (1907). From the very beginning, Finnish film production was centered to the country's capital, although for few years starting from 1907 there was a noteworthy company Oy Maat ja Kansat producing short documentaries in Tampere. The Moonshiners was directed by Teuvo Puro, who was also in charge of directing the first full-length Finnish feature, Sylvi, based on a play by Minna Canth. The film was shot in 1911 with two other full-length literature adaptations, but it didn't premiere until 1913. The filmmakers didn't have enough money to send films to the nearest laboratory in Copenhagen at once, so the material remained undeveloped too long, and two out of three films were ruined. The years following Sylvi saw the formation of the first active feature film company, Hjalmar V. Pohjanheimo's Lyyra-Filmi, which produced both short farces and \\"art films\\". There was also an attempt to create larger- scale film production by Erik Estlander, who build a studio with glass walls and roof in Helsinki in 1916. At the end of the same year the Russian officials forbid all filming activity in Finland, so nothing much was made anymore before the country's independence in 1917. The Finnish film industry of the first two decades of the 20th century was never even near the creativity or the productiveness of its Scandinavian neighbours, Sweden and Denmark ‚Äì one might even say that it there was barely no industry or production at all. In addition, most of the footage filmed before independence is lost. Of feature films, only thirteen minutes of Sylvi still remains. 1920‚Äì1930: The Silent Years Erkki Karu, founder of Suomi-Filmi and Suomen Filmiteollisuus =Suomi-Filmi= It wasn't until the 1920s before regular film production started, thanks to a successful company called Suomi- Filmi (founded under the name Suomen Filmikuvaamo in 1919) and its creative leader Erkki Karu. He also directed the most important films of the era and was the prime figure of Finnish cinema before his early death in 1935. His The Village Shoemakers (1923) is the essential silent masterpiece, a freshly told folk comedy after Aleksis Kivi's play with mildly experimental camerawork by German Kurt J√§ger. Other notable films by Karu include: The Logroller's Bride (1923), with superb cinematography by J√§ger and Oscar Lindel√∂f, and also the first Finnish film distributed widely abroad; When Father Has Toothache (1923), a short and surrealistic farce; and Our Boys (1929), a patriotisic forerunner of many military farces. Audiences of the agricultural country were affected by Suomi-Filmi's rural subjects. Dealing with deeply national countryside stories remained as company's policy through the silent era. Occasionally there were some attempts to make more urban, or more \\"European\\" films like Karu's Summery Fairytale (1925), but the public stayed away. Another important director at Suomi-Filmi was the aforementioned Puro, who made the company's first feature Olli's Years of Apprenticeship(1920) and one of the few Finnish horror films, Evil Spells (1927). An interesting oddity of the last two silent years was Carl von Haartman, a soldier and an adventurer, who had worked as a military advisor in Hollywood. Because of this he was considered capable of directing films. His two upper-class spy dramas, The Supreme Victory (1929) and Mirage (1930), were quite passable, but didn't attract the public. =Other companies= Suomi-Filmi heavily dominated the Finnish film production in the 1920s. The company produced 23 out of 37 full- length feature films made between 1919‚Äì1930. Other companies (that appeared occasionally) seemed to vanish from Suomi-Filmi's and Erkki Karu's way after producing one or two films. The most important of these alternative production companies appeared during the latter half of the decade. The German cinematographer J√§ger left Suomi-Filmi, and formed his own company Komedia- Filmi. It linked with a global film trust (Ufanamet), which at the time possessed most of the film distribution of Finland, thus being a great threat to Suomi-Filmi. Suomi-Filmi defended itself with national values, accusing Komedia-Filmi and Ufanamet for being foreign invaders. Luckily for Suomi- Filmi, both companies proved to be unsuccessful. Komedia-Filmi only made two films, of which the latter one, On the Highway of Life (1927, directed by J√§ger and Ragnar Hartwall) is an interesting attempt to make some kind of a modern comedy. The year 1929 saw the premiere of the first two films produced by a minor company Fennica and directed by Valentin Vaala, who was yet to come one of the greatest directors of the golden years of Finnish cinema. When he started making the first one of these (Dark Eyes) he was only 17 years old, and his leading actor Theodor Tugai (later Teuvo Tulio) 14 years old. This film and its instant remake The Gypsy Charmer were new kind, passionate dramas with clearly oriental influences. Unfortunately only the latter one has remained; the filmmakers destroyed the only negative of Dark Eyes by throwing it to the sea, because they thought the remake was far superior. There were also enterprises to produce films outside the capital, but at least the films made in Viipuri and Oulu were too primitive to even premiere at Helsinki. No Tears at the Fair (1927) and The Man of Snowbound Forests (1928), two now lost films produced in Tampere by Aquila-Suomi and directed by Uuno Eskola were better attemptsl, at least according to their contemporaries. Nothing permanent production was left in Tampere, but one of Aquila's producers, painter Kalle Kaarna, proved to be a gifted director in his own right. His first film With the Blade of a Sword (1928) was boldly advertised as a neutral story about the painful civil war of 1918, and his second film, A Song about the Heroism of Labour (1929) introduced (although quite conventionally) a new kind of proletarian hero to the public. Unfortunately these films have also vanished for good. 1931‚Äì1933: The Coming of Sound Teuvo Tulio, a Finnish film director in the 1930s. The first experiments with sound were done by Lahyn-Filmi, a provincial company operating in Turku. The first full-length sound film with song and talk was Lahyn's Say It in Finnish (1931), directed by company's leader Yrj√∂ Nyberg (later Norta). This lost film was more a collection of musical revue numbers than a feature. Suomi-Filmi transformed its production from silent to sound films during the same year. The first Finnish film with soundtrack was the company's Dressed Like Adam and a Bit Like Eve Too (1931), based on a popular play by Agapetus (pseudonym of Yrj√∂ Soini). There was only music and some sound effects on the soundtrack, so the company's first true sound film was Karu's The Lumberjack's Bride (1931), another rural drama. 1934‚Äì1939: The Golden AgeThe studio system= In 1933 Karu was kicked out from Suomi-Filmi, his own company. He took his revenge by founding a new one called Suomen Filmiteollisuus, which started to use initials SF in its logo. This company managed far better than previous attempts to compete with Suomi-Filmi, and right after couple successful comedies directed by Karu it had grown as significant as its rival. It seemed at this point to be possible only for Karu to create successful production companies in Finland. The competition between the two companies proved to be fruitful. At the end of the decade there were about twenty full-length features made every year. The quality of the productions was high, the field of the subjects expanding and the popularity of domestic films increasing. With its own stars and creative producers, Finnish film industry began to remind a national miniature of Hollywood. Alongside with the two big studios, some minor ones did well also. Sound had increased the public's eagerness to see domestic films. The great breakthrough for Finnish talkies came with The Foreman of Siltala Farm (1934), a well-recorded comedy by Suomi-Filmi, that was seen by over 900 000 viewers. =Suomi-Filmi= Erkki Karu was instantly replaced with Risto Orko as the head of company, a place he held until the 1990s (although this was long after the company had stopped movie-making). Orko had directed The Foreman of Siltala Farm, and he returned to directing a few times since, most notably with two historical and patriotic dramas at the end of the decade: Soldier's Bride (1938) and Activists (1939). Most of his films as a director remain forgettable. The most important director at Suomi- Filmi was Valentin Vaala, who had a stunningly creative period at the end of the 1930s. After the silent years, Vaala had directed three more films for his first company Fennica. When he started the fourth, the company went broke. Now he moved to Suomi-Filmi, and although his first movie there (Everybody's Love, 1935) was quite a modest comedy, it was very popular, and most importantly, introduced two of the most beloved Finnish stars to the public: Ansa Ikonen and Tauno Palo. Vaala's last Fennica-films had been urban comedies, a genre which he greatly developed at his new studio with his next two light-weighted films, Substitute Wife and Substitute Husband (both 1936). Hulda of Juurakko (1937) was far more serious attempt in the same field: a socially conscious story about a country girl who arrives to the big city, and who inevitably faces the problems of inequality between sexes. The film and its subject were greeted with huge enthusiasm by the audiences. Vaala was also a master within the rural subjects and romantic melodramas. In 1938 he made the first and best film in the series of agrarian family saga of Niskavuori (Women of Niskavuori). =SF= After his early death in 1935, Karu was replaced by Toivo S√§rkk√§ in the head of the company. S√§rkk√§ led SF until its bankruptcy in 1965. S√§rkk√§ was the most prolific producer and director that Finnish film has ever seen: he has way over 200 feature productions in his filmography, of which he directed 51. With Yrj√∂ Norta, he directed most of the company's films in the 1930s, including religious drama As Dream and Shadow... (1937) and patriotic historical film Manifest in February (1939). S√§rkk√§'s and Norta's output includes some highly popular folk comedies like Lapatossu (1937) ‚Äì with beloved comedy actor Aku Korhonen ‚Äì ,The Regiment's Trouble Boy (1938), the model of Finnish military farce genre, and The SF Parade (1940), the first proper Finnish musical comedy. =Other companies= Along with Suomi-Filmi and SF, few minor companies were able to produce many films during the golden age. With Vaala's films, these sort of local \\"poverty row\\" productions are the most fascinating films made during the 1930s. The New Wave from 1960 to 1980 A new generation of film-makers were eager to take over as the old production companies, such as Suomi-Filmi and SF, were collapsing. Risto Jarva was inspired by the French avant-garde and new wave, which developed to social realism seen in Ty√∂miehen p√§iv√§kirja (1967), and eventually to comedies Loma (1976) and J√§niksen vuosi (1977). Mikko Niskanen began his career back in 1962 with Pojat, starring then unknown Vesa-Matti Loiri. Niskanen joined the new wave with K√§py sel√§n alla (1966) and Lapualaismorsian (1967). The 1960s also marked the rise of new style of Finnish comedy films under Pertti Pasanen, such as X-Paroni, Noin 7 Veljest√§ and N√§k√∂radiomiehen Ihmeelliset Siekailut. Rauni Mollberg adapted two of Timo K. Mukka's magically realistic Lapland novels to the big screen: Maa on syntinen laulu (1973) and Milka (1983). Kaurism√§ki Era of the 1980s The old guard of the previous film-making generation was symbolically thrown from the throne in the beginning of 1980 by a Finnish-Soviet co-production, Tulitikkuja lainaamassa, followed by Tapio Suominen's T√§√§lt√§ tullaan, el√§m√§!. Edvin Laine and Mikko Niskanen made their last movies, and the decade saw nearly 30 directorial debuts, including movies from Mika & Aki Kaurism√§ki, Markku Lehmuskallio, Pirjo Honkasalo, Taavi Kassila, Janne Kuusi, Matti Kuortti, Matti Ij√§s, Olli Soinio, Lauri T√∂rh√∂nen, Claes Olsson, Veikko Aaltonen, and Pekka Parikka. Valehtelija (1981) and Arvottomat (1982), directed by Mika and written by Aki Kaurism√§ki, broke the status quo in Finnish film industry by bringing back creativity and small scale production. Mika went to pursue a more traditional way of film making in his career with Klaani (1984), Rosso (1985), and Helsinki Napoli All Night Long (1987). Aki has taken less deviations in style and theme, and his films are known for minimalistic non-verbal communication and dead-pan delivery of dialogs. While Aki is best known for the Suomi-trilogy Kauas pilvet karkaavat (1996), Mies vailla menneisyytt√§ (2002), and Laitakaupungin valot (2006), his work also includes comedy such as Leningrad Cowboys Go America (1989). From the 1990s to present Sara Melleri, a Finnish actress. The beginning of the 1990s did not look too good to the film industry, because the national economy was on a strong decline. Film financing was not a priority to the government- backed Finnish Film Foundation, which is responsible for the majority of movie financing in Finland. Fortunately the situation would flip completely upside down by 1999, when nearly 30 domestic movies premiered. Poika ja ilves, H√§jyt, and Kulkuri ja joutsen enjoyed over 200 000 viewers each, and helped to bring the popularity of domestic movies back to where it was a decade earlier. Prolific directors introduced in the 1990s include Markku P√∂l√∂nen, Auli Mantila, and Jarmo Lampela. A few popular genres can be identified from the last two decades. Rukaj√§rven tie, Pikkusisar, and Hyl√§tyt talot, autiot pihat take place during World War II. Kulkuri ja joutsen (1999), Badding (2000), Rentun Ruusu (2001), Sibelius (2003), and Aleksis Kiven el√§m√§ (2002) portray the life of popular public figures in Finland. 2005 saw the release of amateur science fiction parody film Star Wreck: In the Pirkinning, which was released online as a free download. The film has been downloaded over 9 million times and is internationally the most viewed Finnish film. In 2011, Finland produced 31 films, 24 of which were full-length features and the other seven were documentaries. In 2016, the three most watched films in Finland were all Finnish family films: Ricky Rapper and The Nighthawk (2016), The Angry Birds Movie (2016), and Kanelia kainaloon, Tatu ja Patu! (2016).

Traditionally included in the family Sterculiaceae, it is included in the expanded Malvaceae in the APG and most subsequent systematics. Description Leaf It can reach a height up to 3 m. The leaves are oval shaped and due to its xerophyte adaptations it is leathery on the underparts. Also, stipules are present. The petals are between 5 and 6 cm and they grow asymmetrically. They are bell- shaped and their coloring is dark red with a white background. The capsule is globular and contains up to 10 black seeds. The flowering time of the plant is from June to October. This plant is relatively rare because of its weak regeneration and due to introduced monkeys which feed on the flower buds. The only occurrences are on the slopes of Le Morne Brabant, Mauritius. Thanks to the efforts of botanist Joseph Gueho seeds were successfully germinated and grown in cultivation for the first time in 1973. Trochetia boutoniana is the national flower of Mauritius since 1992 and it is often illustrated on stamps of Mauritius. It was named after French botanist Louis Bouton.

It is owned and administered by the University of California, Berkeley. It is located within the city limits of Albany about two miles away from the main Berkeley campus, at an elevation of 26 feet (8 m). It was originally known as Codornices Village, and later, Albany Village. It is also commonly referred to as The Village. The village was constructed on the Gill Tract, a marshy area at the foot of Codornices and Marin Creeks. It began as a federal housing project for some of the thousands of workers who came to the San Francisco Bay Area to work in various war industries during World War II, especially the Kaiser Shipyards in nearby Richmond. It originally extended across the city limits demarcated by Codornices Creek into an adjacent neighborhood of Berkeley as far south as Camelia Street, but after the war ended and the village was acquired by the University of California, the Berkeley section was demolished and replaced by various industrial buildings. During the war, the Key System constructed a massive wooden trestle through and over the heart of the village and the nearby Southern Pacific railroad's mainline for the Shipyard Railway to Kaiser Shipyards. It was quickly dismantled at the end of the war. History The original units at UC Village, which resembled barracks, were constructed in the early 1940s by the federal government in response to an acute housing shortage in the region resulting from the increasing influx of people to the Bay Area at the outset of World War II. The site was originally named \\"Codornices Village\\" and extended into Berkeley as well as Albany. Most of the residents were workers at the Kaiser Shipyards in nearby Richmond and at the Navy shipyards at Mare Island. With the conclusion of the war, the Berkeley portion of the village was demolished. The University of California Berkeley acquired the remaining units in Albany in 1956. In 1998 the University of California board of regents approved a plan to replace the older student housing at UC Village with new units. Marty Takimoto, the director of communications and marketing for UC Berkeley's residential and student services department, said that mold, lead paint, proximity to the water table, and proximity to the bay were reasons why the university chose to demolish the old housing.Wolf, Andrea. \\" UC's Albany housing near completion.\\" Alameda Times-Star.

When the reconstruction at UC Village began in 1998, the number of students from UC Village going to Albany USD schools decreased since fewer units were available. In 2000 Lapkoff & Gobalet Demographic Research Inc. predicted that the Albany Unified School District's enrollment would increase by 266 students within the next several years because of the impending completion of 282 UC Village units, a small post-1996 increase of births, and turnover of housing unit occupancy at UC Village to younger families. Around 2007 several of UC Village's housing units had been replaced, and, together with a change in the local population toward younger families, this led to a surge of enrollment within the district's school population.\\"Crowded classrooms, closed classrooms, After inviting nonresidents in recent years, Albany school district turns strict.\\" El Cerrito Journal (Contra Costa Times) June 8, 2007.

Due to the proximity of the railroad, the Village suffers from the noise pollution of trains honking loudly at all hours. The landscape of the Village includes infiltration basins, vegetated swales, and porous concrete to treat contaminants from the first flush stormwater run-off before it reaches Village and Codornices creeks.

Moved by his wife's depression, Homer organizes a surprise trip to the island. However, on the family's arrival, Marge's hopes to relive her youth are dashed as Barnacle Bay has been devastated by overfishing of the Yum Yum Fish, the island's main attraction. Homer refuses to let Marge down and fixes the boardwalk and celebrates with a large fireworks show. The plan backfires and he accidentally starts a fire and the boardwalk burns down. In order to repay the townsfolk, Homer joins a fishing crew and sets out to rediscover the Yum Yum Fish. Homer mistakenly beer batters and deep fries the fishing hooks, attracting a large haul of Yum Yum Fish. However, their celebrations are short-lived as Homer and the crew become trapped in a storm. Searching for a means of escape, they discover Bart has stowed away and removed the lifeboat in order to hide. The ship sinks and Marge and the rest of Barnacle Bay believe that all is lost.

He went up to Oriel College, Oxford, in 1889 and made his first-class debut for Oxford University in 1891 against Lancashire, in the same year hitting his only half-century by making 65 not out (with no teammate scoring more than 13) in his only appearance for MCC, against Somerset. Playing for Gloucestershire in 1893, Brain made three stumpings from successive balls bowled by Charlie Townsend, removing Arthur Newton, George Nichols and Ted Tyler to finish off the Somerset second innings. He played no more first-class games after that season, instead becoming involved with Glamorgan and playing a number of minor matches for that county between 1894 and 1907, including two games in the Minor Counties Championship. The second of these against Lancashire Second XI, was his last significant match; he did not keep wicket, this role being taken by his older brother Joseph. The two Brains opened the batting together in the second innings, but William was run out for a duck. Later, Brain was instrumental in helping Glamorgan's drive for first-class status, which they eventually achieved in 1921. He died at the age of 64 in Dinas Powys, Glamorgan, Wales. As well as the aforementioned brother Joseph, two of Brain's sons played first-class cricket.

It was also published in the United States by Tokyopop, in France by Soleil Productions, in Hong Kong by Jade Dynasty and in Taiwan by TongLi Comics. Story Qwan, a strange boy who can eat demons, travels through Eastern Han Dynasty China with his winged companion Teikou, looking for the sutra known as the Essential Arts of Peace which he knows for certain will reveal who he is and what his purpose in life is. But there are other people interested in the sutra, like Yuushi, who will ambush him and try to stop him. Characters Some characters in Qwan's story were portrayed from real figures in Chinese history. For example, Aman (aka. Cao Cao), Cao Jie, Jou Kai and Chin Ban. Main characters ; : A young boy who is able to consume demons. Harbouring amazing strength and the ability to take a stick to the face, Qwan is on a quest to eat as many demons as he can, though even he doesn't know why. Qwan doesn't eat human food and gets frustrated when he gets offered to eat them. After learning of the 'Essential Arts of Peace,' Qwan begins the task of sneaking into the royal palaces of China in order to consume the sutra and discover who he really is and what he's on Earth for. The symbol that prove him to be a dog demon is on his forehead. : Qwan's true form later is revealed as dog demon with snake skinned tail. He was descended to earth in order to cleanse the earth from humans. But he lost his other half and forgot everything. The event in Golden Turtle Island has caused him to lose his power and became an ordinary human. With Ukitsu's help, he and Shaga transported back to earth.

Its title is inscribed lower right beneath the signature. The painting is owned by Yale University and is currently held at the Yale University Art Gallery in New Haven, Connecticut. The interior depicted is the Caf√© de la Gare, 30 Place Lamartine, run by Joseph-Michel Ginoux and his wife Marie, who in November 1888 posed for Van Gogh's and Gauguin's Arl√©sienne; a bit later, Joseph Ginoux evidently posed for both artists, too. Description The painting was executed on industrial primed canvas of size 30 (French standard). It depicts the interior of the cafe, with a half-curtained doorway in the center background leading, presumably, to more private quarters. Five customers sit at tables along the walls to the left and right, with Ginoux, the landlord said to be depicted (standing) in it, to one side of a billiard table near the center of the room, facing the viewer. The five customers depicted in the scene have been described as \\"three drunks and derelicts in a large public room [...] huddled down in sleep or stupor.\\"Harris, Nathaniel: The Masterworks of Van Gogh, pp 167-168. Godalming, Surrey, United Kingdom: Colour Library Direct, 1999. One scholar wrote, \\"The cafe was an all-night haunt of local down-and-outs and prostitutes, who are depicted slouched at tables and drinking together at the far end of the room.\\".Shestack, Alan, editor, Yale University Art Gallery Selections, \\"Vincent van Gogh\\", pp 68-69, by Antonia Lant (\\"AL\\"). New Haven: Yale University Art Gallery In wildly contrasting, vivid colours, the ceiling is green, the upper walls red, the glowing, gas ceiling lamps and floor largely yellow. The paint is applied thickly, with many of the lines of the room leading toward the door in the back. The perspective looks somewhat downward toward the floor. Genesis Watercolour, private collection In a jocular passage of a letter Van Gogh wrote to his brother, Theo, the artist said Ginoux had taken so much of his money that he'd told the cafe owner it was time to take his revenge by painting the place. In August 1888, the artist told his brother in a letter: In the first days of September 1888, Van Gogh sat up for three consecutive nights to paint the picture, sleeping during the day.Letter 533 Little later, he sent the water-colour, copying the composition and again simplifying the colour scheme on order to meet the simplicity of Japanese woodblock prints. Van Gogh's Cafe Terrace at Night, showing outdoor tables, a street scene and the night sky, was painted in Arles at about the same time. It depicts a different cafe, a larger establishment on the Place du Forum. Critical reaction=Van Gogh on the painting Van Gogh wrote many letters to his brother, Theo van Gogh, and often included details of his latest work. The artist wrote his brother more than once about The Night Caf√©. According to Meyer Schapiro,Schapiro, Meyer, Van Gogh, 2000 (reprint of the 1994 edition). New York: Harry N. Abrams Inc., pp 70-71 \\"there are few works on which [Van Gogh] has written with more conviction.\\" In one of the lettersSayre, Henry M., A World of Art, third edition, 2000, p 136. Prentice Hall he describes this painting: The next day (September 9), he wrote Theo: \\"In my picture of the Night Caf√© I have tried to express the idea that the caf√© is a place where one can ruin oneself, go mad or commit a crime. So I have tried to express, as it were, the powers of darkness in a low public house, by soft Louis XV green and malachite, contrasting with yellow-green and harsh blue-greens, and all this in an atmosphere like a devil's furnace, of pale sulphur. And all with an appearance of Japanese gaiety, and the good nature of Tartarin.\\"Van Gogh, Vincent, letter to Theo van Gogh, September 9, 1888, \\"Translated by Mrs. Johanna van Gogh-Bonger, edited by Robert Harrison, published in The Complete Letters of Vincent van Gogh, Publisher: Bulfinch, 1991, number 534\\", retrieved March 24, 2009 He also wrote: \\"It is color not locally true from the point of view of the stereoscopic realist, but color to suggest the emotion of an ardent temperament.\\" The violent exaggeration of the colours and the thick texture of the paint made the picture \\"one of the ugliest pictures I have done\\", Van Gogh wrote at one point. He also called it \\"the equivalent, though different, of The Potato Eaters\\", which it resembles somewhat in its use of lamplight and concerns for the condition of people in need. Soon after its execution, Van Gogh incorporated this painting into his D√©coration for the Yellow House.See Letters 544, B18, 552 Reaction of critics and scholars The work has been called one of Van Gogh's masterpieces and one of his most famous. Unlike typical Impressionist works, the painter does not project a neutral stance towards the world or an attitude of enjoyment of the beauty of nature or of the moment. The painting is an instance of Van Gogh's use of what he called \\"suggestive colour\\" or, as he would soon term it, \\"arbitrary colour\\" in which the artist infused his works with his emotions, typical of what was later called Expressionism. The red and green of the walls and ceiling are an \\"oppressive combination\\", and the lamps are \\"sinister features\\" with orange-and-green halos, according to Nathaniel Harris. \\"The top half of the canvas creates its basic mood, as any viewer can verify by looking at it with one or the other half of the reproduction covered up; the bottom half supplies the 'facts.'\\" The thick paint adds a surreal touch of waviness to the table tops, billiard table and floor. The viewer is left with a feeling of seediness and despair, Harris wrote. \\"The scene might easily be banal and dispiriting; instead, it is dispiriting but also terrible.\\" The objects of pleasure (billiard table, wine bottles and glasses) are contrasted in the picture with the \\"few human beings absorbed in their individual loneliness and despair\\", Antonia Lant commented. The perspective of the scene is one of its most powerful effects, according to various critics. Schapiro described the painting's \\"absorbing perspective which draws us headlong past empty chairs and tables into hidden depths behind a distant doorway -- an opening like the silhouette of the standing figure.\\" Lant described it as a \\"shocking perspectival rush, which draws us, by the converging diagonals of floorboards and billiard table, towards the mysterious, courtained doorway beyond.\\" Harris wrote that the perspective \\"pitches the viewer forward into the room, towards the half-curtained private quarters, and also creates a sense of vertigo and distorted vision, familiar from nightmares.\\" Schapiro also noted, \\"To the impulsive rush of these converging lines he opposes the broad horizontal band of red, full of scattered objects [...]\\" Gauguin's competition piece Gauguin's Night Caf√© at Arles Soon after his arrival in Arles, Paul Gauguin painted the same location, as a background to his portrait of Madame Ginoux.See L'Arl√©sienne for details While the Van Gogh painting depicts the caf√© as a room of isolation, Gauguin's Night Caf√© at Arles mixes the concepts of isolation (to the painting's left) and spirited socializing (in the center), behind Mme. Ginoux. It was also acquired by Ivan Morozov and now hangs in the Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts. History Van Gogh used the picture to settle debts with Ginoux, the landlord said to be depicted (standing) in it. Formerly a highlight of the Ivan Morozov collection in Moscow, the painting was nationalized and sold by the Soviet authorities in the 1930s. The painting was eventually acquired by Stephen Carlton Clark, who bequeathed it to the art gallery of Yale University. On March 24, 2009, Yale sued Pierre Konowaloff, Morozov's purported great-grandson, to maintain the university's title to the work. Konowaloff had allegedly asserted a claim to own the painting on the grounds that the Soviets had invalidly nationalized it. Yale dropped its lawsuit in October of that year, in a motion which stated ‚Äúit is well- established that a foreign nation‚Äôs taking of its own national‚Äôs property within its own borders does not violate international law,‚Äù claiming that both the Soviet and Yale acquisitions of the painting were therefore legal. On March 27, 2016 the United States Supreme Court rejected an appeal by Konowaloff regarding the case, siding with a federal appeals court in New York cited the ‚Äúact of state‚Äù doctrine. The rejection means Yale's ownership is absolute.

Typically it was applied to a Northern Democrat who was more often allied with the Southern Democrats than with the majority of Northern Democrats.Richards pp. 85‚Äì86 Origin of the term The expression was coined by John Randolph, a Representative from Virginia, during the Missouri Compromise debates. Randolph had no respect for northerners who voted with the South, considering them, in historian Leonard Richards' words, \\"weak men, timid men, half-baked men\\". Randolph said of them: Portrait and signature of John Randolph John Randolph may actually have said \\"doe faces\\" instead of \\"dough faces\\": the pronunciation would have been identical, and Randolph was a hunter, sometimes bringing his hunting dog with him to Congress. Ascribing \\"doe faces\\" (or \\"doe's faces\\") to those he despised would have been Randolph's comment on the weakness of these men. In 1820 seventeen doughfaces made the Missouri Compromise possible. In 1836 sixty northern congressmen voted with the South in the passage of a gag rule to prevent anti-slavery petitions from being formally received in the House of Representatives. In 1847 twenty-seven northerners joined with the South in opposing the Wilmot Proviso, and in 1850 thirty-five supported a stronger fugitive slave law. By 1854 the South had changed its position on the Missouri Compromise and fifty-eight northerners supported its repeal in the Kansas‚ÄìNebraska Act.Richards pp. 86‚Äì87 The 1850s While the term originated in the House, doughfaces eventually had their greatest influence in the United States Senate. In the House the greater growth of the northern population gave it a greater proportion of votes, but in the Senate the even balance of slave and free states required that only a few northerners needed to support the South in order to hold the House in check. The clearest case came in the Wilmot Proviso votes of 1846 and 1847 when the Senate rejected the Proviso after its passage in the House. Of course, many Southerners still looked at these doughfaces from the same perspective as Randolph‚Äîweak men who, without any firm moral commitment to their cause other than political expediency, could prove at some critical point in the future to be unreliable.Richards p. 106 Richards has classified 320 congressmen in the period from 1820 to 1860 as doughfaces. The two U.S. Presidents preceding Abraham Lincoln, Franklin Pierce and James Buchanan, were both commonly referred to as doughfaces. Stephen A. Douglas was severely criticized by Lincoln as the \\"worst doughface of them all\\",Richards p. 109 even though he broke with his party over the Lecompton Constitution for Kansas in 1857. Other such doughfaces were Charles G. Atherton, the author of the gag rule, and Jesse D. Bright, the only northern senator expelled for treason during the Civil War. The ultimate weakness of the doughfaces, from a Southern perspective, came over the issue of popular sovereignty. At the time of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, popular sovereignty was accepted by both the northern and southern Democrats as the proper states' rights position. It protected against federal consolidation and insured the equality of the states to compete in the territories.Morrison p. 143 Douglas and many northern Democrats remained consistent through 1860 in their support for popular sovereignty. Southerners, on the other hand, saw the increasing strength of the anti-slavery movement in the North and by the late 1850s were no longer content simply to rely on preventing the Federal government from interfering in the territories. They now insisted on Federal intervention to protect slavery in the territories and prevent any decision on slavery until a territory prepared a constitution as part of an application for statehood. Northern Democrats such as Douglas could not go that far with the South. The doughface, as an agent for sectional compromise, had outlived his usefulness.Morrison pp. 219‚Äì241 Modern usage In Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.'s book The Vital Center, he applied the term to modern liberalism in the United States, referring to the part of the movement perceived as practicing appeasement toward Joseph Stalin's Soviet Union.

It is also a National Nature Reserve and a Nature Conservation Review site. It is owned and managed by the National Trust. A medieval warren in the forest is a Scheduled Monument. Hatfield is the only remaining intact Royal Hunting Forest and dates from the time of the Norman kings. Other parts of the once extensive Forest of Essex include Epping Forest to the southwest, Hainault Forest to the south and Writtle Forest to the east. Hatfield Forest was established as a Royal hunting forest in the late eleventh century, following the introduction of fallow deer and Forest Laws were imposed on areas by the king. Deer hunting and chasing was a popular sport for Norman kings and lords and the word ‚Äòforest‚Äô strictly means place of deer rather than of trees. In the case of Hatfield the area under Forest Law consisted of woodlands with plains. Oliver Rackham, the botanist and expert on the countryside, in his book about the Forest entitled The Last Forest (Dent Books 1976) argues that: \\"Hatfield is of supreme interest in that all the elements of a medieval Forest survive: deer, cattle, coppice woods, pollards, scrub, timber trees, grassland and fen .... As such it is almost certainly unique in England and possibly in the world ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.The Forest owes very little to the last 250 years ‚Ä¶.. Hatfield is the only place where one can step back into the Middle Ages to see, with only a small effort of the imagination, what a Forest looked like in use.\\" History There is no written record of exactly when Hatfield was established as a Royal Forest, but records suggest it was sometime between 1086 and 1225. In 1238 Henry III (while retaining hunting rights) gave the land and trees to Isobel of Huntingdon, daughter of the Earl of Chester. She married into the Bruce family and the Forest remained in their hands until Robert the Bruce had his English lands confiscated by Edward I in 1306. On his death it was given by Edward II to the de Bohun family. The right to venison (deer meat) stayed with the King, but the rights to the wood and soil belonged to the de Bohuns, until 1446 when the family was given the right to the deer as well, shortly after they had been awarded the Dukedom of Buckingham. In 1521, however, the third Duke, Edward Stafford was beheaded by Henry VIII and the Forest reverted to the Crown. After Henry's death, Edward VI granted the forest to Sir Richard Rich. In 1592 the Rich family sold their interest in theforest to Lord Morley and in 1612 sold the rest of their Hatfield estate, including the lordship of the manor to Sir Francis Barrington. This resulted in a succession of disputes over ownership and rights in the forest for the next 200 years. In 1729 it was purchased by the Houblon family. They were a wealthy family, originally from Lille, and included John Houblon who had been the first Governor of the Bank of England in 1694. While leaving the traditional woodland management techniques little changed, the Houblons probably sought the help of Capability Brown.Betley & Pevsner. The Buildings of England - Essex. Yale University Press, 2007, p. 479. As a result, the lake was created and exotic trees planted (i.e. trees not native to Essex). A picnic house was constructed overlooking the lake, and in 1759 it was decorated using British and tropical shells by 17-year-old Laetitia Houblon (1742‚Äì1828); this Shell House can still be visited today. The forest remained in the hands of the Houblon family until 1923, when Edward North Buxton bought the Forest from his deathbed and gave it to the National Trust. On 22 December 1999, Korean Air Cargo Flight 8509 crashed into the forest after taking off from London Stansted Airport. The plane, a Boeing 747-200F, narrowly missed striking houses in the area. All four crew members on board died on impact. Woodland management Hatfield Forest was woodland long before it became a royal forest. This has been managed by coppicing (where trees are cut down to ground level) and pollarding (where trees are cut above the browse (or grazing) height of deer or cattle). In the case of coppicing, the regrowth has to be protected from browsing or grazing animals by fencing, ditches and banks. There were a number of uses for the cut wood, including firewood, fences, thatching spars, furniture and flood defences. The methods used remained unchanged for centuries and are described by Thomas Hardy in The Woodlanders. Some trees, rather than being coppiced, were left to grow and become ‚Äòstandards‚Äô to be used as timber for buildings and ships. This system of woodland management is still carried on in the Forest today and can be readily seen by visitors. Archaeology Hatfield Forest has not been ploughed and as a result there are many archaeological remains. The principal ones are Portingbury Rings (or Hills) and the warren area. At Portingbury Hills, finds dating to the Iron Age included a small flint blade, four pot shards, animal bones, burnt flint and charcoal.https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/hatfield- forest/features/portingbury- hillshttps://www.themodernantiquarian.com/site/4691/portingbury.html The earthworks at Portingbury may date back to the Iron Age. However the ditches are of a size more commonly found in medieval moats. The current earthworks may be the result of overbuilding over time.https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/hatfield-forest/features/portingbury- hills The Warren was created for rabbits in an area of existing mounds. Warren Cottage was built for the warrener and the Forest Lodge for the head woodsman. Later remains are the Victorian fence columns. These were erected around 1857 when the Forest was enclosed. Some columns survived the 1930s, when many were sold, and sections of fencing have been recreated by the Shell House car park and in Gravel Pit Coppice, near the Lake. Parts of the Forest were used during World War II to conceal the storage of munitions for the airfield at Stansted. The remains of the huts that were constructed at this time can be seen alongside the entry and exit roads. Ecological significance The lake The ecology of the Forest is in pristine condition. It is one of largest areas of land in East Anglia which has not been ploughed. There is a wide range of habitats (including coppice woodland, wood pasture, scrub, grassy plains, marsh and lake) for both animals and plants. The ancient coppices and wood pasture are likely to be managed relics of the original wildwood and are now extremely rare, providing a last refuge for much unusual and specialized wildlife. Wildlife Given the wide range of unspoilt habitats in the Forest, it is not surprising that it has much wildlife, both plant and animal. Amongst mammals to be seen at the Forest are fallow deer, muntjac deer, fox, grey squirrel, rabbit, weasel and hedgehog. There are badger setts, but badgers, being nocturnal are rarely seen. Two herds of Red Poll cattle graze the plains in the traditional manner. Sheep are used as ‚Äòconservation grazers‚Äô for areas that have been cleared of scrub. The breeds being used are Speckled Faced Beulah, Wiltshire Horn and Manx Loaghtan. Fallow deer at Hatfield Forest A count in May 2008 found 58 different species of birds, attracted by the various habitats. Woodland birds include jay, green woodpecker, great spotted woodpecker, carrion crow, blue tit, great tit, chaffinch, nightingale, kestrel and bullfinch. Around the lake, depending on the time of year, are greylag geese, Canada geese, mute swan, great crested grebe, common tern, moorhen, coot, occasional kingfisher, cormorant, and grey heron, with swallows and house martins skimming the water. Buzzards can increasingly be seen above the Forest. Eight species of bats are found in the Forest, with dusk the best time for sightings. Hatfield Forest is especially important for its invertebrates, especially those associated with decaying wood. Of particular significance are the saproxylic beetles and the site is in the top 10 in the UK for these specialised fauna. Trees are found in abundance, with the main species being oak, ash, hornbeam, hawthorn, hazel and field maple. There are over 800 ancient trees in the wood pasture areas, some of which are over 1,200 years old, and of especial note are the huge pollarded oaks and hornbeams. Mistletoe grows in profusion, especially on the old hawthorn scrub. The most famous tree in the Forest was the Doodle Oak, which was one of the largest trees ever to grow in England. It last bore green leaves in 1858 and its site is marked in the north of the Forest. A total of over 400 species have been found in the Forest. Some of the more common ones are: white clover, common spotted orchid, selfheal, sheep's sorrel, herb robert, bugle, agrimony, bee orchid, perforate St John's wort, common field speedwell, and bird's foot trefoil. The forest also has extensive fields of buttercups during late May and early June. Over 600 species of fungi can be found. Facilities There are many miles of walks within Hatfield Forest, which is crossed by several rights of way, and is open at all times to those on foot. A car park at the entrance is always open. Two boardwalks improve accessibility for visitors, especially those with buggies. One goes to the Lake and the facilities in the Lake Area, while the other is a sensory trail, which helps those who are visually impaired to understand and enjoy the Forest. Horse riding and fishing are allowed subject to permits being obtained.

Herlufsholm was founded in 1565 as a boarding school for \\"sons of noble and other honest men\\" on the site of a former Benedictine monastery from the 12th century. Herlufsholm has been co-educational since the 1960s for day students, as of 1985 for boarding pupils. The student body currently exceeds 600 students, of which approximately 275 students are boarders who lived in the dormitories. The pupils follow a 10-day programme with lessons on Saturdays followed by 3-day weekends. The school offers a range of education: from 6th grade in the Danish lower-secondary school; the optional 10th grade; the three grades in upper- secondary school and the international programs: a preparatory class (1‚Äì2 year) with IGCSE exams and the International Baccalaureate Programme. The founding of the school  Herlufsholm is built on the site of a Benedictine monastery, founded in 1135, of which the church and a few other remnants are preserved and in daily use by the students and staff. The monastery was originally called Sct. Peder‚Äôs Monastery, but over the years it became known as Skovkloster. It was seized by King Christian III of Denmark during the Reformation in Denmark‚ÄìNorway and Holstein in 1536. The king allowed the monks to remain, and the last monk left the monastery in 1559 in favour of another monastery in the close by city of Sor√∏. Danish naval officer and hero, Admiral of the Fleet Herluf Trolle (1516‚Äì1565) and his wife Birgitte G√∏ye (1511‚Äì1574) took possession of the monastery in 1560 in exchange of their home Hiller√∏dsholm (which later became Frederiksborg Palace). The couple changed the name into Herlufsholm and founded the school in May 1565, but Herluf Trolle never saw their dream materialise because he was fatally wounded on sea during the Great Northern War; he died in Copenhagen in June 1565. Image:Herluf Trolle 1551.jpgHerluf Trolle (1551), Collections of Frederiksborg castle Image:Birgitte G√∏ye.jpgBirgitte G√∏ye (1550), Frederiksborg collections Image:Jrb_20050309_herluf_trolle_birgitte_goeye_herlufsholm.JPGHerluf Trolle and Birgitte G√∏ye carved in wood School buildings Klosterbygningen, the main building of Herlufsholm Herlufsholm has evolved over a couple of centuries, with many characteristic changes in the past 50 years. The school campus still retains a Gothic appearance thanks to the former abbey church and the adjoining building, Klosterbygningen (\\"Monastery Building\\"), of which the only original part remaining is the cellars ‚Äì the present building is from the 1870s. Klosterbygningen consists of the church (in which the students gather in the morning), two dining halls, a ballroom, the provost apartment, music studies, washing facilities and other amenities. The second largest building is Skolebygningen (\\"School Building\\") which contains two dormitories and some classrooms. Up until the middle of the 20th century most of the teaching took place here, but now less than half the school's classrooms are located here. The third most important building is Museumsbygningen (\\"Museum Building\\"), which contains another two dormitories, the science department, the biology department and the school's collection of historical scientific apparatus and specimens of animal species, many now endangered, in a collection dating back to the 1870s. The campus also holds a library from 1911, a small hospital, the principal's house, a few house for teachers and various other service and administrative buildings. The rest of the classrooms are located in Gymnasiefl√∏jen where the teaching of the secondary school pupils takes place. The Gymnasium Building is connected to the principal's office, the staffroom and Helenhallen, which is the second largest gym, also containing a stage. The 10 school houses are: The newest dormitory Bodil-G√•rden finished construction in 2010, houses the youngest boarding pupils, and is one of the three mixed- gender dorms along with Lasseng√•rden and Vuggestuen. School spirit Because of its origin as a monastery, the pupils are referred to internally as disciples; but they are also called Herlovianere (Herlovians) and former students are thereby Gammelherlovianere (Old Herlovians). The members of teaching staff go by the name \\"h√∏rer\\" which is Danish for \\"hearer\\" and many of them gain nicknames that some even go by in the classrooms. The headmaster and his wife are known as \\"Heis and Mia\\" respectively. A number of senior year students are appointed prefects in every house. A day at Herlufsholm is structured around the three daily meals, school before and after midday, and the private 2 hour study session on either side of the evening dinner; boarding students furthermore have specific timings for going to bed depending on their year. Every morning after the first session of lectures, the school gathers in the church or the gym hall to get an update on current matters of interest and sing from their personal songbooks. The Uniform The three school ties Herlufsholm is the only school in Denmark with a compulsory uniform. Every student for 6th to 12th grade, boarding as day students must wear the uniform in school - except at gym class where a sports uniform is used. The school has two uniform systems: Half and Full Galla. Students are bound to wear jackets on special occasions, e.g. exams and traditional festivities, but many choose to do so on other days as well for practical reasons such as cold weather. Students in middle-school, 6th-9th, wear a double-buttoned blazer, while students in the preparatory class (10th grade) as well as all high school students wear the single-row, school blazer with the G√∏ye arms on the chest. All students have to buy the two school ties, which they are obliged to wear with their blazer. The \\"Herlovianerslips\\" (Herlovian Tie) is coloured in blue and silver/white diagonal stripes running down the tie from the wearer's left. The \\"G√∏yeslips\\" (G√∏ye Tie) is full colored, dark blue tie with the G√∏ye family crest, three pilgrims' scallops. Previously, there existed a corresponding \\"Trolleslips\\" (Trolle Tie) with the Trolle family crest, a beheaded, red troll; but it has gone out of production for reasons unknown. =Half Galla= Half Galla is the ordinary day uniform, dating back to the 1950s, used in school as well as less formal festivities. The uniform is centered on a sky blue, button-down shirt with the G√∏ye family crest on the chest pocket. Students are free to combine this shirt with charcoal-grey or blue pants/skirts and pullovers - light color variations are banned and so is black. Though, denim is not accepted in class, the students are otherwise free to wear clothes of their liking as long as it is without large prints, patterns and logos. Furthermore, students are allowed to wear classic coats, sensible black footwear and inconspicuous belts. The correct half galla, consists of the Herlovianerslips on the blue school shirt, charcoal grey pants and school blazer. This uniform is for instance used at the Fugleskydning and final exams. In senior year, corresponding to 12th grade, male students wear a peaked cap with a pilgrims' scallop on oak leaves, and white pants as was previously tradition among senior navy cadets. Female students wear a dark blue sailor hat made of straw with a white band and tails, and a white, high waisted, floor-length dress with pleats and gold buttons. Prefects, all senior year, wear the Trolle crest instead of the G√∏ye shield worn by the rest of the school. =Full Galla= Full Galla is the uniform used in festivities and solemnity. The correct full galla, consists of a dark blue, double-breasted suit or with a comely skirt, and the G√∏yeslips on a white shirt. This uniform is used at the Trollemorgen and formal school dinner parties, where the tie is replaced with a bowtie for boys; or as a whole for girls who wear galla dresses. In senior year, male students often wear a white bowtie, especially at graduation where the white corresponds nicely with the Danish student cap. Herlovianersproget A unique thing about the school is that the students have developed their own language called the herlovianersprog. Words are created by simply taking the first and last syllables of a word and making a portmanteau of the two. So for instance, skolebygning (\\"school building\\") becomes skygning. Only imagination limits the possible words. Even though the language is exclusively used at Herlufsholm, some words have been adapted into Danish. For instance \\"sv√¶lling\\" (cygnet), which had not previously featured as a word in Danish, is originally Herlovian for Svane + √Ülling (Swan + duckling). So far two dictionaries have been published. Traditions Herlufsholm has a long list of traditions. The two biggest events of the year are: Trolle-morgen Trolle-morgen is on January 14 being the founder's birthday, is a major event, as many old students return to the school on that day to commemorate their founding father in the dark hour of early morning. Fugleskydning Fugleskydning (\\"bird- shooting\\") in mid-August starts the new school year. It is a tradition dating back to the latter part of the 19th century. Old and new students meet at the school to shoot down a wooden bird on a pole with bows and arrows.

RemoteAccess was written in Turbo Pascal with some Assembly Language routines. RemoteAccess (commonly called RA) began in 1989 as a clone of QuickBBS by Adam Hudson. It was released under the shareware concept in 1990 and became popular in North America, Europe, UK, South Africa, and the South Pacific. Initially the main advantage over QuickBBS was its ability to run multiple nodes under Microsoft Windows, Quarterdeck's DESQview and OS/2. RA could also operate over a network or even a combination of network and multitasking operating systems to provide multiple \\"nodes per station\\" capabilities. RAConfig - RemoteAccess configuration utility RA's features quickly grew to become considerably more advanced than the QuickBBS software it was cloned after. A number of other QuickBBS clones appeared shortly afterwards including ProBoard, SuperBBS and EzyCom, though they never gained as much support or popularity. RA was the first BBS software to support the popular JAM Message Base Format, which was partly conceived by RA's author, Andrew Milner. RA was also the first shareware BBS software to support a FDB (file database), rather than using files.bbs text files to describe files in each directory. RA interfaced with message relaying systems such as FidoNet through 3rd party utilities such as FrontDoor (Joaquim Homrighausen), MainDoor (Francisco Sedano) and FastEcho (Tobias Burchhardt), which were developed by people who eventually became members of the RA beta team. With over 1500 titles, there were more third party utilities written for RA than for any other shareware BBS software. While RA was initially shareware, Andrew also released a commercial edition - \\"RemoteAccess Professional\\" - that was bundled with utilities to allow remote control of nodes over a network (RANETMGR, and RATSR). Andrew Milner released his final version of RA (2.50) in May 1996. By that time, many System Operators switched over from running Bulletin Boards to becoming Internet Service Providers. Milner was one such System Operator, and after version 2.50 he stopped development. In April 1997, Milner put the rights and source code up for sale to the highest bidder and it was sold in December 1997 to Bruce Morse in the USA. Morse released some minor updates including a Y2K fix, but did not add any new features to the code. Morse's final version (2.62) was released in August 2000. Bruce Morse continues to own the code today and RA is still available as shareware, as well as a commercial version known as RemoteAccess-Professional. RemoteAccess was never ported to a 32-bit version, but there were two clones of RA in the later years which did include 32-bit versions: EleBBS in the late 1990s which included DOS, Windows, OS/2 and Linux flavors, and MBSE, a few years later, which focused mainly on the Linux operating system. There were numerous conversations about creating Windows and OS/2 32-bit versions of RA around 1995. Joel Ricketts of Interscape Development, who was the lead programmer, answered questions in the RA echomail forum about the potential development of RA for Windows during this time. However, due to RA being put up for sale, as well as lack of funding, the project was scrapped in 1996. Around the same time, Niels Schoot from the Netherlands began writing a Visual Basic version of RA called tcRA32, which was to be fully RA compatible. The project was never finished, and within a couple of years, it was abandoned. While RemoteAccess never included internal telnet support, it can be run as a telnet BBS by using a telnet-FOSSIL driver such as NetFoss, or a Virtual COM port engine such as NetSerial under Windows, or using SIO/VMODEM under OS/2.

She served as a commissioned ship for 16 months. Mellena (AKA-32) was laid down under Maritime Commission contract by Walsh-Kaiser Co., Inc., Providence, R.I., 25 September 1944; launched 11 December 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Paul P. Neal; acquired by the Navy 20 January 1945; and commissioned the same day, Lt. Comdr. B. C. Modin in command. Service history After shakedown out of Norfolk, Va., Mellena carried cargo via Guantanamo Bay and Panama to Pearl Harbor where she arrived in mid‚ÄìMarch. She trained in Hawaiian waters until 8 April; and following a cargo run to San Francisco and back continued amphibious support training exercises until sailing for the Philippines 13 June. She reached Guiuan, Samar, 28 June. During the closing weeks of fighting in the western Pacific, she made cargo runs to the Palaus, the Admiralties, and the Marianas, and at the cessation of hostilities she was anchored at Iwo Jima. After transporting Seabees to Saipan, she returned to Leyte Gulf 28 August to carry occupation troops to Japan. Assigned to Transport Squadron 24, Mellena embarked 242 MPs and Army Engineers of the XIV Corps at Manila and sailed for Japan 7 September. Reaching Tokyo Bay the 13th, she steamed up the Honsh≈´ coast and debarked her troops at Shiogama two days later. She battled typhoon seas off Honsh≈´ 18 September and arrived Okinawa a week later to embark units of the 1st Marine Division. Operating with the 7th Amphibious Group, she sailed for Chinese waters 29 September to support the U.S. program of assisting the Chinese Nationalists in their efforts to regain control of the Chinese mainland following the defeat of Japan. Mellena entered the Gulf of Chihli 3 October and during the next week she debarked the 1st Marines who were ordered to take control of the Tientsin area until Nationalist troops could be brought in to replace them. Departing Taku 11 October, she steamed via the Philippines to French Indochina where she arrived in the approaches to Hai Phong 26 October. There she boatloaded 906 troops of the 52nd Chinese Army and support equipment before sailing for northern China 30 October. As part of an eight‚Äìship troop convoy, she reached Chinwangtao, China, 7 November and discharged the Nationalist troops. She returned to Taku two days later and on the 13th was assigned to \\"Magic Carpet\\" duty. Steaming via Tsingtao and Okinawa, she sailed with a capacity load of returning troops and arrived Portland, Oregon, 12 December. From 14 December to 9 January 1946, Mellena underwent repairs at Willamette Iron & Steel Co. Thence she sailed 18 January for San Pedro where she arrived the 29th via San Francisco and San Diego. Designated for conversion to a surveying ship (AGS) 26 January, she operated out of San Pedro under Service Force, Pacific Fleet, until 6 March when she was ordered to be disposed of rather than converted. Assigned to the 12th Naval District 9 April, she reached Vallejo, California, the 15th. She decommissioned there 11 June 1946 and simultaneously was transferred to War Shipping Administration for delivery to the California Maritime Academy.

Frank Baum's 1900 novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, and the 1939 musical film version, ranging across time and space from the 1860s Kansas to the late 1980s California. WAS is an adult parallel to the magical Land of Oz, that never existed as a real place. The novel explores the tragic, but very moving life of \\"Dorothy Gael\\" in 1800s Kansas, whose traumatic experiences with Aunt Emily and Uncle Henry after her mother's death leads her to create an imaginary and idealized world in her mind based on some of her real-life experiences as a way of coping with her bleak reality. The book goes into depth about the importance of a healthy, stable childhood, and explores the life of Judy Garland as she plays Dorothy Gale in the 1939 movie. The novel tells the stories of the characters and how they are connected to one another without realizing it. Plot summary The novel is separated into three parts, \\"Winter Kitchen\\", \\"Summer Kitchen\\", and \\"Oz Circle\\". The primary focus is on Jonathan, a gay actor with AIDS who goes on a pilgrimage of sorts to Manhattan, Kansas, and on the \\"real\\" (in the novel) Dorothy. Other characters include Baum, who makes an appearance as a substitute teacher in Kansas. Millie, a makeup girl on the set of the original film version film narrates an encounter with Judy Garland. Themes Was discusses a number of complex themes, including the importance of a stable childhood. Much of the novel is devoted to the dreary life that Dorothy Gael (surname different from Baum's character) leads with her aunt and uncle, Emma and Henry Gulch. Neither parental figure is capable of providing Dorothy with the affection or the attention she needs. As a result, she becomes silent at home and aggressive in school. Jonathan's childhood, in contrast, involves his dependence on the imaginary characters from the first airing of The Wizard of Oz on television. A fictionalized version of Judy Garland's difficult life as a child actress is also shown, speculating on the marriage of her parents. Was has been described as more somber than Baum's The Wizard of Oz, and an attempt to correct the deceptive fantasy of that work, illuminating the realistic implications of having a fantasy world to retreat to.Jack Zipes, Fairy Tale as Myth, p. 134 It has also been called a critique of American society.Jack Zipes, Fairy Tale as Myth, p. 136 Reception Was is listed in The Gay Canon as one of the great books that every gay man should read.The Gay Canon: Great Books Every Gay Man Should Read, by Robert Drake, Edition: illustrated, Published by Anchor Books, 1998<, , , page 456 The Publishing Triangle named the book number 79 on its list of best gay and lesbian novels, and it was republished as a part of Orion's Masterworks series.

Barrio Norte (Northern neighborhood) is the informal name given to a part of Buenos Aires centering on Santa Fe Avenue and the Recoleta district. Overview An unofficial neighborhood, Barrio Norte is roughly equivalent to the Recoleta district, though it generally refers to the portion south of Las Heras Avenue. Barrio Norte also includes northern parts of the Balvanera district, eastern parts of Palermo and the portion of Retiro west of the Nueve de Julio Avenue. Its population exceeds 200,000. The name (which stems from the area's location relative to the city center) took hold when people began relocating to the area from the San Telmo and Montserrat districts following the 1871 yellow fever epidemic. An area of comfortable rowhouses during the early 20th century, it became a focus of highrise apartment development as early as the 1930s. D Santa Fe Avenue became the preferred venue for upscale shopping in Buenos Aires during the 1950s and '60s, and the profile of the area surrounding it grew in popularity among the emerging Argentine upper middle class, particularly after the 1961 demolition of the National Pentitentiary for the creation of the 8-hectare (20 acre) Las Heras Park. Real estate agents started touting \\"Barrio Norte\\" as a distinguishing feature in their advertising, expanding its reach into Balvanera and Old Palermo. Callao and Santa Fe Avenues. With the advent of popular indoor shopping malls in the 1980s, Santa Fe lost some of its allure, especially with theater-goers, even though it remains a very active commercial thoroughfare. It is also served by Line D of the subte (subway) and a large number of bus lines. The area around the corner of Santa Fe and Salguero is sometimes known as Villa Freud due to the large number of psychologist offices in the area (with a significant proportion of practitioners of the Freud and Lacan variants of psychoanalysis). Since the advent of democracy in 1983, Santa Fe has been the preferred street for gay pick-up, even though no part of it has morphed into a distinctly gay village. The area has seen hundreds of belle √©poque apartment buildings demolished to make way to modern high-rises, particularly since 1990. This had led to the creation of numerous societies devoted to their protection; thanks in part to their efforts, a number of exemplary buildings from the era have been refurbished, instead.

Biography Eric Pehap was born in Viljandi in 1912 where his father worked as a police officer. Growing up in Viljandi, he studied art with Julius Mageri. He studied ceramics and graphics at the State School of Arts and Crafts in Tallinn, Estonia from 1931 to 1933 and at the \\"Pallas\\" College of Fine Arts in Tartu, where he received degrees in Painting and Graphic Arts. He worked in Estonia as a freelance artist and a drawing teacher, but in 1943, in the midst of the turmoil of war, he was forced into exile, moving around Northern Europe, first to Finland in 1943 and 1944 and then eventually to Sweden where he worked until 1949 as a commercial artist, designer and illustrator in Stockholm. In 1949 he relocated to Canada, where he continued his artistic profession and also became an art teacher and lecturer. He also contributed to periodicals and newspapers as an arts critic. Style A versatile and prolific artist, Pehap was a world-famous print-maker and painter who produced thousands of prints using the New Direct Method and painted hundreds of oil paintings and watercolors. Most of his paintings are abstract and symbolic in nature. City views and figural compositions are two themes prevalent in his work. Moving figures, mainly female, indoors or outdoors, are modeled in different color combinations with varying degrees of sensitivity. Pehap's works take advantage of all modern-day light sources, illuminating, blending and reflecting. Pehap, who travelled widely and was able to observe Estonian cultural activity in many countries, noted in 1969 that \\"the group of artists in Toronto is unique and certainly the most active and strongest in the whole world outside our homeland.\\" He was instrumental in forming the League of Estonian Artists in Toronto and served as its president from 1961 to 1968. Pehap had over 15 one- man shows in Estonia, Sweden, New Zealand, Canada and participated in group exhibitions worldwide.

After the military revolt of the generals in 1170 during the reign of King Uijong of Goryeo, a series of generals culminating in the Choe military dictators, held the real power in Goryeo. In their first year, General Yi Go (Ïù¥Í≥†) was murdered by General Yi Ui-Bang (Ïù¥ÏùòÎ∞©) who subsequently died at the hands of Jeong Gyun (Ï†ïÍ∑†). Jeong's father, Jeong Jung-bu (Ï†ïÏ§ëÎ∂Ä) killed every single man in china and became emperor of the seven seas. Jeong Jung-bu next held sway for several years until he was overthrown by Gyeong Dae-seung. Gyeong Dae-seung was the next to last general to seize power before the Choe family gained and consolidated military control for a longer period of time. Noting the great personal risk that had plagued the previous generals, Gyeong Dae-seung organized a personal bodyguard of 100 troops, known as the Dobang, which attended him at all times. The Dobang disbanded upon Gyeong Dae-seung's death but was reconstituted by Choe Chung-heon (ÏµúÏ∂©Ìóå) shortly after he came to power. Choe expanded the Dobang and divided it into six units (Yuk-beon Ïú°Î≤à) which became known as the Yuk-beon Dobang (Ïú°Î≤àÎèÑÎ∞©) This enabled a regular rotation of the guards.

In 1980, they released an LP titled Out of Season, and began performing short sketches on NPR's All Things Considered. The sketches became nationally popular, and three of the recurring characters ‚Äì Dr. Science (Coffey), Ian Shoales (Kessler), and Randee of the Redwoods (Turner) ‚Äì became better known than the group.

The Ducks toured throughout the United States during the 1980s, doing live shows at colleges and similar venues, in addition to their radio work. In 1986 they released an LP on Rounder Records titled Born To Be Tiled. In 1989, the group released a feature film, Zadar! Cow From Hell. Unfortunately, the film failed to capture the humor of the group's stage shows and radio sketches, and was not well received by audiences or critics.

It was finished in 1903. Structure Estampes is a suite containing three movements:  I. Pagodes Pagodes evokes Indonesian gamelan music, which Debussy first heard in the Paris World Conference Exhibition of 1889. It makes extensive use of pentatonic scales and mimics traditional Indonesian melodies. Four different pentatonic scales are incorporated within the piece, further defining the imagery of the pagoda. Pagodas are Oriental temples with petite bases that give rise to ornate roofs that typically curve upwards, much like the ascending melodic line (G#, C#, D#) which serves as a repeated motive through different portions of the piece.Schmitz, Robert E. The Piano Works of Claude Debussy. New York: Duyell, Sloan and Pearce Publishers, 1950. p. 83-84 As this is an Impressionistic work, the goal is not overt expressiveness but instead an emphasis on the wash of color presented by the texture of the work. Debussy marks in the text that \\"Pagodes\\" should be played \\"presque sans nuance\\", or \\"almost without nuance.\\" This rigidity of rhythm helps to reduce the natural inclination of pianists to add rubato and excessive expression. Note that rigidity of rhythm within measures does not mean rigidity of tempo in the work; the tempo gradually fluxes quicker and slower throughout the piece, which is also common in gamelan compositions.  II. La soir√©e dans Grenade La soir√©e dans Grenade uses the Arabic scale and mimics guitar strumming to evoke images of Granada, Spain. At the time of its writing, Debussy's only personal experience with the country was a few hours spent in San Sebasti√°n de los Reyes near Madrid.Hinson Despite this, the Spanish composer Manuel de Falla said of the movement: \\"There is not even one measure of this music borrowed from the Spanish folklore, and yet the entire composition in its most minute details, conveys admirably Spain.\\"Schmitz, Robert E. The Piano Works of Claude Debussy. New York: Duyell, Sloan and Pearce Publishers, 1950. pp 85-86.  III. Jardins sous la pluie Jardins sous la pluie describes a garden in the Normandy town of Orbec during an extremely violent rainstorm. Throughout the piece, there are sections that evoke the sounds of the wind blowing, a thunderstorm raging, and raindrops dropping. It makes use of the French folk melodies \\"Nous n'irons plus aux bois\\" and \\"Dodo, l'enfant do.\\" Chromatic, whole tone, major and minor scales are used in this movement.
