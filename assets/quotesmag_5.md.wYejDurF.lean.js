Salviigränd () is an alley in Gamla stan, the old town in central Stockholm, Sweden. Stretching from Västerlånggatan to Myntgatan, it is the northernmost alley of the former street. The alley is named after the diplomat and Councillor Johan Adler Salvius (1590–1652) (Welb- Johan Adler Salvij gränd, 1641; Salvij grendhen, 1652) who made a fortune marrying the widow of the goldsmith Lorens Hartman and who owned several properties in the alley. At the time the alley included parts of today's Myntgatan, and Salvius also owned buildings on the opposite side of Myntgatan where today Kanslihuset (the \\"Chancellery House\\") is found. The first element of the name, Salvii, is Latin genitive meaning Salvius' (e.g. \\"...of Salvius\\"). It remains uncertain, however, which alley was actually referred to using the present name in the 17th century, and, as the neighbourhood have been considerably altered while poorly documented, only the identity of the man carrying the name in question remains irrefutable. On the second floor on number 1, the only building in that block not part of the Parliament administration, is a suite of rooms created by Louis Masreliez for the tradesman and bachelor Wilhelm Schwardz in 1795. Sensuously dressed up in pastel, grey, and gold, the elegant Gustavian Classicism interiors features lighted candles, cut-glass chandeliers, taffeta curtains, and friezes and medallions displaying a multitude of classical gods and figures, all perfectly restored by the current owner, the insurance company Skandia.

Assisted by the French police, directed by René Bousquet, the Germans organized a raid to arrest Jews. The police checked the identity documents of 40,000 people, and the operation sent 2,000 Jews first to Fréjus, then to the camp of Royallieu near Compiègne, in the Northern Zone of France, and then to Drancy internment camp, last stop before the extermination camps. The operation also encompassed the expulsion of an entire neighborhood (30,000 persons) before its destruction. Located in the Old Port, the 1st arrondissement was considered by the Germans to be a \\"terrorist nest\\" because of its small, windy and curvy streetsMaurice Rajsfus, 1995, La Police de Vichy. Les forces de l’ordre françaises au service de la Gestapo, Le Cherche Midi éditeur, 1995, p.210 For this occasion, SS leader Carl Oberg, in charge of the German Police in France, made the trip from Paris, and transmitted to Bousquet orders directly received from Himmler. It is a notable case of the French police's collaboration with the German occupiers.  Destruction of the Old Port  transporter bridge The operation was intended to reshape the area of the Old Port, a popular neighborhood whose small, curvy and windy streets were considered dangerous by the German authorities. The Germans used for this an urbanist plan prepared by French architects who supported the ideology of the \\"National Revolution\\" (Révolution nationale) supported by Vichy. They decided to almost totally destroy the 1st arrondissement of Marseille. According to Himmler's orders the arrested population was to be evacuated to the concentration camps in the Northern Zone of France, in particular Compiègne. The Old Port itself was to be searched house by house by the German police, assisted by their French counterparts, and then the buildings dynamited. Mandated by the head of Vichy, Pierre Laval, Bousquet demanded on 14 January 1943 that the operation be postponed for a week to better organize it and have reinforcement from police force. Furthermore, while the Germans were about to limit themselves to the 1st arrondissement of Marseille, Bousquet spontaneously proposed to extend the operation to the entire city. According to historian Maurice Rajsfus, he also requested complete freedom of action for the French police, which he obtained from SS Karl Oberg. Evacuation of the Old Port According to historian Jacques Delarue, who was a witness of the operation, 200 police inspectors from Paris and elsewhere, 15 compagnies of GMR and squads of French constabularies (Gendarmerie) and of mobile guards (guardes mobiles) were brought to Marseille for the operation. In total, \\"approximatively 12,000 police men found themselves concentrated in Marseille.\\".Jacques Delarue, Trafics et Crimes sous l’Occupation (Livre de Poche, 1971), p.262 On 22 January 1943 the Old Port was completely locked-out. The city, except for the more wealthy, residential, neighborhoods, was searched house-by-house over a period of 36 hours. \\"In total, following tens of thousands of controls, nearly 2,000 Marseillese... found themselves in the death trains.\\" wrote historian Maurice Rajsfus. 1,500 buildings were destroyed. The Prefecture of the Bouches-du-Rhône published a public statement on 24 January 1943: > For reasons of military order and to guarantee the safety of the population, > the German military authorities officially ordered the French administration > to proceed immediately with the evacuation of the north end of the Old Port. > For its part, the French administration decided on the grounds of internal > security to carry out a vast police operation to rid Marseille of certain > elements whose activities posed great risks to the population. The French > administration worked hard to avoid mixing up the two operations. Sizeable > police forces carried out numerous searches in the quarter. Entire > neighbourhoods were surrounded and identity checks were made. More than > 6,000 individuals were arrested and 40,000 identities were checked.Quoted by > Maurice Rajsfus, 1995, p.213. French: ' The newspaper Le Petit Marseillais of 30 January 1943 added: > Let us be clear that the operations for the evacuation of the Old Port were > carried out exclusively by the French police and that they did not give rise > to any incidents.French: ' (ibid.) German newspapers also acclaimed the operation. Walther Kiaulehn wrote in German military newspaper Signal: > In the future, when we shall write the history of Marseilles, we will > underline this remarkable feat that by having evacuated the old patrician > neighborhood, which had been dishonored by the 20th century, the operation > had used French and German policemen, as a group of engineers and > physicians.Quoted by Rajsfus, p.213.

He was signed by the Buffalo Bills as an undrafted free agent in 2006. He played college football at Saginaw Valley State. Professional career=Buffalo Bills DiGiorgio was signed by the Bills as an undrafted free agent in 2006. That year, he was the only undrafted free agent to make the Bills' 53-man roster. He overcame a lot of adversity, and added depth to a (during the time) weak defense.#52 John DiGiorgio - Buffalo Bills As a rookie in 2006, DiGiorgio played in 12 games and made eight tackles. But when London Fletcher departed for Washington after the season, it gave DiGiorgio a chance to compete for the starting job. DiGiorgio had a big year for the Bills in 2007. He played in all 16 games—the final 13 as a starter at middle linebacker—and was second on the team with 113 tackles. John took full advantage of Paul Posluszny's injury, and filled in as the middle linebacker in the 2007 season. As John filled in for the injured starting linebacker he did an exceptional job. His \\"blue-collar\\" work-ethics made him the 2007 Buffalo fan favorite. With Buffalo being a predominate blue-collared environment the fans took notice of John being a natural underdog in the NFL with a great work-ethic. The combination of hard-work and Buffalo natives recognizing his background, adversities, and doing an exceptional job as the backup MLB sparked the Buffalo fans support. He also had two fumble recoveries and an interception. The Bills were in the playoff hunt late in the season, but they lost their final three games to finish with a 7-9 record. Among DiGiorgio's highlights was his sack of New England Patriots' quarterback Tom Brady in Week 3 for his first career sack. He also intercepted a pass from Tony Romo in a 25-24 loss to the Dallas Cowboys. However, the following season, DiGiorgio appeared in six games primarily on special teams before tearing a ligament in his right knee while blocking on a punt return in the second quarter of a 23-14 win over San Diego in Week 7. He was waived by the Buffalo Bills on July 25, 2009 for failing his physical after having season- ending surgery to repair bone damage in his right knee. He retired on July 25, 2010. Personal DiGiorgio is an Italian-American. DiGiorgio pursued his teaching certification at Saginaw Valley, stating that \\"(NFL) stands for 'Not For Long' -- instead of the National Football League -- because careers don't last long in the NFL. John DiGiorgio was a student teacher at Siebert Elementary School in Midland. DiGiorgio, a former All-American at Saginaw Valley State University, helped out Bob Wellman in his physical education classes. He also delivered big hits that drew fans to create catch phrase for his incredibly astonishing, punishing, blows delivered to opposing players: \\"It's not delivery, it's Digiorgio!\\"abc12.com: NFL player spends off season teaching 2/13/08 During the 2008 off-season, DiGiorgio began to student-teach physical education at Siebert Elementary in Midland, Michigan. In July 2010 he accepted a job teaching Physical Education and coaching at Chippewa Valley High School in Clinton Township, Michigan. During the Summer of 2014 John returned to his old team at Eisenhower High School, where he now serves the Eagle's as Offensive Coordinator.

This fungus is very similar to U. nuda, the cause of loose smut, and was first distinguished from it in 1932.  Symptoms  The disease is not apparent until heading, at which time, smutted heads emerge slightly earlier than healthy heads. At first, each smutted head is covered by a delicate, paperlike, grayish membrane. These membranes break shortly after the smutted heads have emerged and expose a dark brown to black, powdery mass of spores. This spores are easily dislodged, leaving only the bare rachis.  Disease cycle  The disease cycle of Ustilago nigra is similar to that of U. hordei, the cause of covered smut of barley. The teliospores survive on the surface or in the soil. In some cases, the teliospores that are deposited under the hull, may germinate immediately. The mycelium then grows into the lower layers of the seed and then remains dormant until seed germination. Infection of seedling occurs between germination and emergence. Infection can occur from seed-borne teliospores or by teliospores residing in the soil. Relatively dry soil at temperatures of 15–21 °C, are most favorable for infection. The invading mycelium becomes established within the growing point. As the plant enters the boot stage, the mycelium grows rapidly into the floral tissue which is converted to masses of black teliospores. Teliospores are disseminated by wind or during combining. The teliospores may remain viable for several spores.  Management  The incidence of false loose smut can be reduced by using clean seed, treated seed and resistant cultivars.

They became famous locally as one of the first bands to adapt the popular punk sound to something slower and heavier, paving the way for grunge bands like Green River and Mother Love Bone before breaking up in 1984. History=Early years (1982–1983) The group was formed in 1982 by The Fartz members Paul Solger and Duff McKagan (also of the Fastbacks). Filling out the band's line-up were vocalist Steve Verwolf, bassist David Garrigues, and future Mother Love Bone drummer, Greg Gilmore. Garrigues left the band in 1983 due to personality clashes. McKagan took over duties on bass for a single 8-track recording of Necropolitan Affair and subsequently left the band in 1984. Jim Lightfoot (former partner in Modern Productions and member of Memory) joined as bass player, but stayed only for a single performance. The final pre-Sub Pop line up was cemented by the addition of Daniel House on bass. Despite criticism from the punk rock purists of the area, the band's performances are generally regarded as legendary; there were hints of psychedelic elements which caused Black Flag's Henry Rollins to label them the \\"punk rock Hawkwind\\". Pearl Jam's Stone Gossard has credited them as the band that inspired him to learn guitar. It is perhaps not surprising then that the first of Gossard's bands to gain recognition - Green River - used the same grinding, slowed-down, punk rock riffage. 10 Minute Warning made numerous attempts at recording, most notably with Jello Biafra's Alternative Tentacles label and in 1984 they recorded what was to be their first album. This effort included the songs \\"Last Dream\\", \\"Again\\", \\"Life\\", \\"Stooge\\", \\"Necropolitan Affair\\", \\"Echoes\\", \\"Disraeli\\", \\"Heaven\\", \\"Woke Up Dreaming\\" and \\"Memories Gather Dust\\". They also recorded a version of Pink Floyd's \\"The Nile Song\\", but the album was never released. At the time the Seattle music industry was still young, and the indie labels which helped propel bands from that area into stardom in later years had yet to come into fruition. It is for this reason that Ten Minute Warning never released any recorded material before they split in 1984. This left groups such as Green River and Soundgarden to become known as the founders of what later became known as grunge. Breakup (1984) The band played a farewell performance at the Lincoln Arts Center in Seattle in 1984. Solger left for New York with The Fags. He also later played in a band called Meddaphysical. Verwolf went to San Francisco in the hopes of securing a gig singing for The Black Athletes; he returned to Seattle after two weeks and fell back into a drug habit that caused him to move on from the music scene. Verwolf returned to music in 1991 when he teamed up briefly with Steve Weid (Tad) and Scott Wade (Sledge) in an early version of Foil. McKagan and Gilmore moved to Los Angeles. Gilmore quickly became disillusioned with the LA scene and returned to Seattle and eventually joined Mother Love Bone. McKagan remained in LA and joined Guns N' Roses. Reunion (1997–1998) McKagan left Guns N' Roses in 1997 and moved back to Seattle; he reconnected with many old friends, including Stone Gossard. With Gossard's encouragement, the band reunited that year with new vocalist Christopher Blue; Steve Verwolf was serving a term in Federal Prison and was, therefore, unavailable. It was at this time that the band finally recorded a self-titled album on well known Seattle label Sub Pop. It contained nine tracks, including two new versions of songs originally recorded by The Fartz (\\"Is This The Way?\\" and \\"Buried\\") and the original version of \\"Mezz\\" (which was later re-recorded for McKagan's unreleased solo album, Beautiful Disease). The album was eventually released in 1998. By this time, Paul Solger had quit due to \\"musical differences\\". Ten Minute Warning played its last show on August 22, 1998 at the Roseland theater in Portland, Oregon. Since then, McKagan has reunited with his former Guns N' Roses bandmates Slash and Matt Sorum to form Velvet Revolver, and Paul Solger was diagnosed with and successfully treated for cancer in 2004. As of 2008, he resides in Eastern Washington with his parents. Steve Verwolf died of a heroin overdose in August 2008. Only a month before he died, Verwolf made a deal with Jason Potbelly of Northwest hardcore punk icons Potbelly to do a split 7\\" titled \\"Then and Now\\"; this release would showcase an unreleased track recorded in 1983 on the 10 Minute Warning side and a classic Potbelly track on the other. The limited pressing 7\\" was released the day of Verwolf's funeral. Potbelly attended Verwolf's funeral and presented his family copies of the record.

His big year was 1960, when he also won ten more tournaments, to earn the No. 1 ranking in the United States. That year he reached the Quarterfinals of the U.S. Championships. He received the Bob Hope Award for the Amateur Athlete of the Year in 1960. Mackay died in San Francisco on June 15, 2012 after a long illness. Early years MacKay was born in Cincinnati, Ohio and grew up in Dayton, Ohio, where he attended Oakwood High School. In 1950, he won the National Boys Indoor Doubles Championship. He was the Ohio State High School Tennis Champion in 1952 and 1953. He was ranked #16 in the National Juniors. Playing career MacKay enjoyed a 17-year career as an amateur and a professional tennis player, winning 29 singles titles and 11 doubles. He started his tennis career in the 1950, as National Boys Indoor champion and then in 1952, as the Ohio State High School Champion. From there, he enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1953 along with Mark Jaffe and Dick Potter to form a strong team under tennis coach William E. \\"Bill\\" Murphy. Entering college Barry was ranked #16 in the Juniors, Mark Jaffe #10, and Dick Potter #20. Barry practiced often with Professor and ranked player Andy Paton, Jr, who made him a much better player.

The Hebrew word is mashiach (Messiah). Chabad messianism, or Lubavitch messianism,also: Habad messianism, Lubavitcher messianism, mishichism, meshichism. generally refers to the passion among adherents of the Chabad movement regarding the coming of the mashiach or Moshiach (Messiah), and their goal to raise awareness that his arrival is imminent. In addition, the term also refers more specifically to the belief that Menachem Mendel Schneerson, Chabad's seventh leader, is the Messiah.Susan Handelman (July 1, 2014), The Lubavitcher Rebbe Died 20 Years Ago Today. Who Was He?, Tablet Magazine.Adin Steinsaltz, My Rebbe page 24 A few years before the seventh Rebbe's passing, members of the Chabad movement expressed their belief that Menachem Mendel Schneerson is the Messiah. These beliefs have been termed \\"Chabad messianism\\", and those subscribing to the beliefs have been termed Meshichists (messianists). A number of Jewish leaders have publicly voiced their concerns and/or opposition towards certain aspects of Chabad messianism. A chant recited by a number of Chabad messianists proclaiming Schneerson as the messiah is the \\"Yechi\\".The full text is \\"Yechi Adoneinu Moreinu v'Rabbeinu Melech haMoshiach l'olam vo'ed\\" (\\"Long Live our Master, our Teacher, and our Rabbi, King Messiah, for ever and ever). Customs vary among messianists as to when the phrase is recited. The concept that the Messiah can come at any given moment is a basic tenet of Judaism. The idea that the leader of a Hasidic group could be the Messiah is a nuanced and complex idea that traces itself back to the times of the Baal Shem Tov, the founder of Hasidism.Elliot R. Wolfson. Open Secret: Postmessianic Messianism and the Mystical Revision of Menahem Mendel Schneerson. Page 19.http://www.chabad.org/library/moshiach/article_cdo/aid/101679/jewish/The- Personality-of-Mashiach.htm During Schneerson’s life many Jews hoped that he would be the Messiah. This idea gained great vocal attention during the last years of his life.See section \\"Before Schneerson's Death\\"The Messiah of Brooklyn: Understanding Lubavitch Hasidim Past and Present, M. Avrum Ehrlich, ch.9 notes, KTAV Publishing, During those years, there were strong forces within the Chabad–Lubavitch movement, led by the two executors of Schneerson's will; Yehuda Krinsky, and Abraham Shemtov, resisting the messianic movement.Josepf Telushkin Rebbe; page 413. Since the Rebbe's death, there are those who have persisted in the belief that Schneerson is still the Messiah, sometimes extremely vocally. Chabad messianists either believe Schneerson will be resurrected, or refuse to admit that he died, instead proclaiming that he is still alive. The Chabad–Lubavitch umbrella organization, Agudas Chasidei Chabad, and the governing body of Chabad–Lubavitch rabbis, Vaad Rabonei Lubavitch, have both denounced the messianic behavior.http://moshiachtalk.tripod.com/kolkoreh.pdfSee: \\"After Schneerson's Death\\". The issue received much negative attention, and remains controversial.Josepf Telushkin \\"Rebbe\\"; page 420.Messianic Excess, Rabbi Prof. David Berger (Yeshiva University), The Jewish Week, June 25, 2004Peter Schäfer, Mark R. Cohen, Editors (1998) Toward the Millennium: Messianic Expectations from the Bible to Waco BRILL, , p. 399 Concept=Background During Menachem M. Schneerson's life, some of his supporters thought that he could be revealed as the mashiach (Messiah). There were many Chabad Hasidim who proclaimed this very passionately. The concept that a righteous Jewish leader may be revealed as the Messiah was believed by many rabbis and scholars regarding their own leaders throughout Jewish history. This idea finds its earliest roots in an early 4th century discussion in the Talmud: After schools of various prominent rabbis each cite proof-texts that the name of the Messiah is indeed that of their very own teacher, Rabbi Nachman says, \\"If he [the Messiah] is among the living, he is someone like me.\\" The Talmud then cites the sage Rav: \\"If the Messiah is among the living, then he is someone like our holy Rabbi [i.e., Rabbi Judah, the editor of the Mishnah]. [And] if he is from among the dead, he is someone like Daniel.\\"Sanhedrin 98b Maimonides ruled the following as the definitive criteria for identifying the mashiach: If we see a Jewish leader who (a) toils in the study of Torah and is meticulous about the observance of the mitzvot, (b) compels the Jews to follow the ways of the Torah and (c) wages the \\"battles of God\\"—such a person is the \\"presumed mashiach\\" (bechezkat mashiach).Mishneh Torah, Law of Kings, 9:4, Maimonides If the person succeeded in all these endeavors, and then rebuilds the Holy Temple in Jerusalem and facilitates the in-gathering of the Jews to the Land of Israel—then we are certain that he is the \\"actual mashiach\\" (mashiach vadai). Mashiach shebador In addition, a number of Talmudic texts, and subsequent writings of halakhic (Jewish law) authorities, speak of this that in every generation there is always one person who is worthy and has the potential of being the Messiah, and will redeem the Jewish people, should they be deserving. This third form of the messiah is referred to in halakhic writings as the Mashiach shebador, meaning the messiah of the generation. According to the Chatam Sofer: \\"In every generation there is one righteous man (tzaddik) who merits to be the Messiah... and when the time comes, God will reveal Himself to him and send him.\\"Responsa Chatam Sofer VI:98 According to Chaim Hezekiah Medini, not only is there such a figure in each generation, but this figure was sometimes explicitly identified as such. \\"They assumed who it [Messiah] may be... Rabbi Judah the prince... in his generation they said and knew that it was he who was worthy... and [he goes through a few other generations and then adds] based on this the disciples of the Arizal wrote that in his time it was him. All this is simple and straightforward.\\"Peat Hasadeh section 1 rule 70 Anticipation Yisrael Meir Kagan (1838-1933) Anticipation for the coming of the mashiach, and belief in the imminent arrival, has been on the hearts and minds of Jews through the past two millennia. Maimonides ruled that all Jews must believe with perfect faith, each day, that the mashiach will come and the resurrection of the dead will take place. He rules that anyone who does not believe this, denies the entire Torah.Maimonides Laws of Kings 11:1 Yisrael Meir Kagan (\\"the Chofetz Chaim\\") wrote \\"our days are the days of Messiah’s coming. Hear my brothers and friends; these are the days of Messiah. It is clear that our days are the days of Messiah’s coming,\\"Likutei Michtavim page 4 and Moshe Feinstein, wrote that \\"we are obligated to anticipate the arrival of the Messiah on any given day as a near certainty.\\" Messianism in Hasidism=Background Hasidim in general, focused very much on the mashiach and future redemption. In a vision in which Baal Shem Tov, the founder of Hasidism, encountered the mashiach, the former asked the latter when he will come. The mashiach answered \\"when your teachings [of Hasidism] will be spread forth\\". Many Hasidic discourses speak of the need to refine the world and prepare it for its ultimate perfectness when the mashiach will come. Throughout Hasidic history, there have also been numerous cases of Rebbes that have been identified by their Hasidim as worthy of being the Messiah. These figures were not thought of having been the actual Messiah, since the criteria that must be fulfilled by the Messiah have been clearly stipulated by Maimonides. Followers hoped that it would be their leader who would be the Messiah and occasionally spoke of him as the Messiah.Yitzchak keller, Moshiach Bedor, 1991. Yehuda Eisenstein records in his book Otzer Yisrael, that followers of Hasidic Rebbes strongly hope that their leader will be the one God chooses to be the Messiah \\"the chasidim believe, that even though there are many righteous people in the generation, each of whom is exceptional in his way of divine service and righteousness, each of whom has godly powers of spirituality, nevertheless there is always one who is above all the rest, he is the one who is the tzadik of the generation. He is the one who is the messiah of the generation.\\" Messianism in Chabad As with other Hasidic groups, Chabad Hasidim had a history of hoping that their Rebbes would be the Messiah. Schneerson himself spoke of his father-in-law, Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn, as the mashiach of his generation. In addition, the Chabad Rebbes often spoke with great passion about the coming of the redemption and the Messiah's imminent arrival. In a speech he gave in 1942, Joseph Ber Soloveitchik praised the efforts of the Chabad Lubavitch campaign to raise awareness to the coming of the mashiach. Soloveitchik said, \\"The Lubavitcher Rebbe speaks and publicizes about the Mashiach and a tumult has erupted, an uproar and an outcry. What is wrong, I ask? That people who are heretics decry him; I understand. That those who violate the Shabbat decry him; I understand. But that those who study the Talumud and Chassidus decry him; this is inconceivable...Are we not allowed to talk about the belief in the Mashiach anymore?\\"Yosef Dov Soloveitchick. Oiystzug Fun Der Rede 1943 After the passing of his father-in-law Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn, his gravesite, known as \\"the Ohel,\\" became a central point of focus for Menachem Mendel Schneerson, who would visit it regularly for many hours of prayer, meditation, and supplication for Jews all over the world. The then seventh Rebbe of Chabad, Menachem Mendel Schneerson, openly declared his deceased father-in-law, the former Rebbe of Chabad Lubavitch, to be the mashiach. Until today, followers of Chabad hashkafa (worldview) imitate the manners of their deceased seventh Rebbe Menachem Mendel Schneerson. During Schneerson's life=Schneerson's passion for the imminent arrival of the Messiah Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn (1880-1950) After Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn died in 1950, his son-in-law, Menachem M. Schneerson, soon became the seventh Rebbe. The Rebbe was a passionate believer in the coming of the mashiach. In a letter to Israeli President Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, Schneerson wrote: \\"From the time that I was a child attending Cheder, and even before, the vision of the future Redemption began to take form in my imagination -- the Redemption of the Jewish people from their final Exile, a redemption of such magnitude and grandeur through which the purpose of the suffering, the harsh decrees, and annihilation of Exile will be understood.\\" Schneerson also encouraged people to focus on Messiah very much. Beginning with his very first farbrengen as Rebbe, he spoke of this generation's mission to complete the Dira Betachtonim, and urged everyone to do all within their power to help the world reach its ultimate state of perfection, when Godliness and goodness will be naturally apparent and prevalent, with the final redemption.Adin Steinsaltz, My Rebbe, page 173. Schneerson would finish almost every public talk of his with a prayer for the imminent arrival of the Messiah. As early as the 1970s, he sought to raise awareness of the Messianic age by encouraging people to learn and become knowledgeable in the laws of the Holy Temple, laws that will only apply when the Messiah actually comes. In this connection, he quoted from earlier rabbinic opinion that learning about the redemption would raise awareness of and could actually bring the Messiah sooner. Schneerson would frequently quote the many sages who stated that this generation was the last generation of the exile and would be the first generation of redemption and would quote the Chafetz Chaim and others, who stated that actively asking for the Messiah's coming is crucial.Adin Steinsaltz, My Rebbe, page 178 Criticism of Schneerson's passion for the arrival of the Messiah As Schneerson's passion about the need for Messiah became more well-known, criticism also built up. In 1980, a group of children from a Chabad summer camp composed a song with the words \\"am yisrael [nation of Israel] have no fear, Moshiach will be here this year, we want Moshiach now, we don’t want to wait.\\" Schneerson seems to have received great satisfaction from the children's initiative, and greatly encouraged their song.Telushkin, Rebbe: p. 431 In light of some criticism about the insistent tone of these words, on one occasion he explained \\"This has always been the hope and yearning of the Jewish people – that the Messiah should come now, immediately. Therefore it is inappropriate for someone to say that he does not want, or that he does not agree, or that he is not comfortable that people are imploring 'we want moshiach now.' Each Jew clearly prays and pleads three times a day in the amida, while standing before the Al- mighty (at that time a person is certainly speaking the truth, and saying what he means) et tzemach David avdecha me’hera tatzmiach [that we merit the final redemption and coming of the Messiah speedily], and then continues ki lishuatcha kivinu kol hayom, that he hopes for this the entire day!\\"Likutei Sichot vol. 20 pp. 458-459 Schneerson urged and talked about purifying all parts of the world through Torah and Mitzvahs (commandments) in order to bring Mashiach. Many times he would weep publicly about the deep slumber and exile we are in, and how urgent it is that God redeem us, both for our sake as well as even for His own.Adin Steinsaltz My Rebbe page 174 Nevertheless, criticism of his passion about the coming of the Messiah and, his urging people to do all they could to bring about the redemption by adding in the observance of Torah and Mitzvahs, was something that was known to him. On one occasion he even remarked \\"I have merited that the complaint people have against me is that I am passionate about the Mashiach.\\" Talk of Schneerson as the Messiah Menachem M. Schneerson (1902-1994) Many Hasidim of the seventh Rebbe, Menachem Mendel Schneerson felt that he is the mashiach of the generation, even though he never said so himself.Chabad's Messianism and Israeli Radicals. Azure no. 41. According to research by Rachel Elior, the belief that the Rebbe would be the Messiah built up during the 1980s. She asserts that messianism can be traced back even to the previous Lubavitcher Rebbe, but cites evidence that the 1980s saw an upsurge. Nevertheless, this hope was initially kept to a hush.\\"The Lubavitch Messianic Resurgence: The Historical and Mystical Background 1939–1996\\", Rachel Elior in Toward the Millennium: Messianic Expectations from the Bible to Waco ed. Peter Schäfer and Mark Cohen, 383–408. (Leiden: Brill, 1998) Shalom Dov Wolpo brought up the issue in 1984 by publishing a booklet declaring Schneerson to be the Messiah. Schneerson responded by banning the publication and forbidding Wolpo from involvement with any Messiah related topics.The Revelation of Melech HaMashiach (King Messiah), \\"Yechi HaMelech\\", Sholom Ber Wolpo, \\"The Committee for Fulfilling the Rebbe's Directives\\" Wolpo would later argue that despite the Rebbe's strong opposition, \\"everyone must still consider and proclaim the Rebbe as the Messiah\\" arguing that \\"acceptance of the Messiah must be done by the people not by the King\\".Telushkin, Rebbe: p. 429 As the years went on, and recognition of Schneerson as being so toweringly unique, a Rebbe of truly unprecedented and universally recognized stature, spread ever further, this messianic speculation spread to greater numbers and higher volume than in previous generations. The Hasidim became vocal of their hope that Schneerson would be the one to be the Messiah. Chaim Bergstein was quoted as saying \\"I'm not saying he is or isn't Mashiach, but there is no one as learned ... in this generation.\\" Time magazine journalist Lisa Beyer reported that Adin Even- Yisrael said he wished that Schneerson should be revealed as the Messiah.\\"\\"Expecting the Messiah — An Ultra-Orthodox sect says the Redeemer is due to arrive any day now — and he might be an American\\" Time magazine, Lisa Beyer, March 23, 1992] (paywalled). Even Rabbi Yehuda Krinsky told The New York Times in 1988: \\"Our sages tell us that the Messiah is a man of flesh and blood who lives among us... If I were asked in this generation who was the most suitable, beyond any question, in my mind, it would be the Rebbe.\\" Some Chabad Hasidim took their message to the streets with billboards declaring that it was time for the Messiah to come and bring the redemption.\\"Billboards hold a big message: the messiah is here\\", Michael Crook and David Hancock, Miami Herald, April 15, 1992 Schneerson's response The first record of Hasidim referring to Schneerson in messianic terms was in 1965. That year, Avraham Parizh printed letters that spoke of Schneerson as the Messiah and started handing them out in Israel. When Schneerson learned of this, he immediately dispatch a telegram to Parizh in Israel saying that he was \\"shocked by the letter [you wrote and disseminated]\\" and asked that Parizh \\"immediately cease distributing it.\\" Schneerson instructed Parizh to \\"gather and send to all extant copies of the letter, every last one, and please confirm immediately that you have fulfilled this instruction.\\"Echad Hoyo Avrohom Page 160 In 1984, Sholom Dov Wolpo published a booklet identifying Schneerson as the Messiah. Schneerson publicly denounced these actions several times. During one of these talks he said that those involved [in the publication] were starting a new war against Chabad, and that he should never have to speak about it again. On Shabbat Bereshit, when Wolpo began singing a song that had long been popular in Lubavitch, which referred to Schneerson as the Messiah, he abruptly stopped the singing and ordered that it never be sung again.Sefer Hisva'aduyos 5745, Vol. 1, p. 465 In 1991, Aharon Dov Halprin, the editor of Israeli magazine Kfar Chabad, prepared an article that explained why the Rebbe was worthy of being considered Messiah. When the Rebbe got word of this he responded sharply, \\"If you, God forbid, [plan to] do anything even remotely similar, it is preferable that you shut down the periodical completely\\". On a number of occasions Schneerson said that rabbis should issue a psak din (ruling) that Moshiach must come. In 1988,Yitzchak Hendel issued a ruling stating, not that the Messiah must come, but that the Rebbe was to be the Messiah. When the Rebbe saw the ruling, he responded to Hendel and wrote me’heichan dantuni? (Talmudic term connoting: On what basis have you ruled against me?) Is this the standard of all your rabbinic rulings!?\\"Cheshbono shel Olom page 56. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Schneerson's talks became increasingly focused on the topic of Moshiach, that Moshiach was about to come, and what was needed to accomplish this. These talks would often take on a sense of urgency. This, coupled with Schneerson's frequent statement that ours is the \\"Last Generation of galut (exile) and it is the first generation of geulah, the redemption\\" is one of the arguments put forward that the Rebbe is the Messiah. On one occasion, during the Rebbe's talk at the International Conference of Shluchim (emissaries), he stated, \\"the work of the Shluchim has already finished, and the only task left is to welcome Moshiach\\". In the early 1990s, Hasidim became more vocal about Schneerson being the Moshiach, even submitting a petition to him asking that he reveal himself as the long-awaited messiah. On one occasion in 1991, as the Rebbe was leaving the evening prayers when traditionally someone would start a song and the Rebbe would encourage it on his way out of the synagogue, some Hasidim began singing one of the Rebbe’s favorite lively songs, adding the words of Yechi - \\"Long live our master, our teacher, our Rebbe, King Moshiach.\\" A few months later, a few people did muster the courage to start singing at an intermission in a Shabbos farbrengen a less overt song that implied that the Rebbe was the Messiah. Within a few seconds the Rebbe heard it and immediately became very grave and said: \\"Really, I should get up and leave [the room]. Even if some people consider it is not respectful that I need to [be the one to leave], I don’t need to reckon with the views of a small number when [what they are saying] is the opposite of reality. However, first of all, it will unfortunately not help anyway. Secondly, it will disrupt the shevet achim gam yachad (brethren to dwell together in unity), for if I were to leave, others will leave, too.\\"Sichos Kodesh, Parshas Noach 5752 In 1992, a journalist from Israel said to the Rebbe, \\"We appreciate you very much, we want to see you in Israel; you said soon you will be in Israel, so when will you come?\\" The Rebbe responded: \\"I also want to be in Israel.\\" The journalist insisted, \\"So when, when will you come?\\" The Rebbe responded, \\"That depends on the Moshiach, not on me.\\" The journalist persisted, \\"You are the Moshiach!\\" to which the Rebbe responded, \\"I am not.\\" During Schneerson's illness On March 2, 1992, while praying at the Ohel, the site where his father-in-law is buried, Schneerson suffered a massive stroke. That very evening, while he was being treated for his stroke and Chabad Hasidim around the world gathered for prayer, some of the messianists broke out in song and dance. It was during this period of illness and inability to communicate that the messianic movement reached its greatest fervor, and became more vocal of their hope that Schneerson would soon be the mashiach. This also troubled many people who felt that it was being imposed upon Schneerson as something he had no control over. In the fall of 1992, a special balcony was constructed on the upper level of the synagogue at 770 Eastern Parkway, which overlooked the main sanctuary. This was done in order to allow Schneerson to participate at the daily prayers. It soon became customary for many Hasidim to recite the Yechi after prayer, to which Schneerson made encouraging motions with his left hand (his right side had been paralyzed by the stroke). On certain occasions; the Rebbe made increasingly big signs of encouragement, such as on Rosh Chodesh Kislev 1992 (5753), when the Rebbe moved his hand back and forth with extreme energy. During the next two years, the messianists began publicizing their message on television and in newspaper advertisements. Some of Schneerson's collected speeches from the previous two years of his life were collected into pamphlets and published under the title Besuras Hageula. These especially were distributed by the messianic Hasidim in an effort to bolster the case that he would be the Messiah despite his illness, and that the coming of the Messiah is imminent. Such publications was used to bolster the hope that Schneerson would be the mashiach. By late 1992, with much talk of Schneerson as the Messiah, a movement to formally crown Schneerson as Messiah gained prominence. Shmuel Butman announced his plan to crown the Rebbe.\\"Letter from Crown Heights\\", Malcolm Gladwell February 2, 1993 The Washington PostMashiach Madness reaches frenzy as Lubavitch 'anoint' the Rebbe, Debra Nussbaum Cohen, Jewish Telegraphic Agency January 28, 1993 The Rebbe, who had been paralyzed and speechless since March the previous year, would join the daily prayers on a special balcony that was built for him to easily be wheeled. Butman planned to crown the Rebbe on January 30, 1993 after the evening prayers. However, when the Rebbe got word of the planned event, he communicated to his secretaries Leibel Groner and Yudel Krinsky that he would only attend for the usual evening service. Both Groner and Krinsky, then followed by Butman, announced that the event was actually not a coronation and should not be intended as such.\\"Rabbi's appearance fails to reveal messiah\\", Deseret News, February 1, 1993 Schneerson's death On 3 Tammuz 1994, more than two years after he suffered a stroke that took away his ability to speak, the Rebbe died. His death left the Chabad community, much of the Jewish world, and even beyond, in mourning.Death of Lubavitcher Leader, Rabbi Schneerson, Stuns Followers , Laurie Goodstein, Washington Post, June 13, 1994 From all over the world, people streamed to New York to participate in the funeral. The New York Times placed six articles about the Rebbe in the paper that week. Television devoted many hours of broadcast time to Schneerson’s death. The New York Times reported from the funeral that the death had left many Jews stunned: However, his view was not shared by all. Some of the messianists were so caught up with their hope, that they interpreted each new erosion in the Rebbe's health, and ultimately his very death, as stages in the messianic process. They cited various midrashic statements to fuel their ecstasy as to the imminent revelation of the Messiah, and some of them drank and toasted l’chaim and danced before and during the funeral - an act that shocked many admirers of Schneerson across the Jewish world. And in the days after Schneerson's death, many journalists and pundits wrote how they expected the end of the movement.\\"What Really Happens When Prophecy Fails: The Case of Lubavitch.\\" Dein, Simon. Sociology of Religion, 9/22/2001. For many Chabad followers, the death of the Rebbe was extremely painful. He was laid to rest next to his father-in-law, at the Ohel, at the Montefiore cemetery in Queens. In Jewish tradition, significant dates are frequently referred to by their Hebrew characters. Chabad (like other Jewish movements) dating back to their first Rebbe, Shneur Zalman of Liadi, dates of all their Rebbes' deaths by Hebrew dates. Thus, in the case of Schneerson, the anniversary of his death became known as Gimmel Tammuz (the third of Tammuz). In the week after the Rebbe's death, the Wisconsin Chronicle editorialized and wrote how many Jews now find it difficult to believe that Messiah will ever come: The belief that Schneerson would still be the Messiah after his death For many hopeful, often vocal, followers, Schneerson's death did not rule out the hope that he could still be the Mashiach. There are Talmudic and halakhic sources that speak of the possibility that a righteous Jewish leader could be resurrected to become the mashiach. These positions, although not well-known, figure quite prominently and early in authentic Judaic sources. The Babylonian Talmud states: \\"If he [the Messiah] is among the dead, he is someone like Daniel.\\" In fact, the most well-known deceased figure identified as being able to be the Messiah in rabbinic literature is King David. Not that he is the mashiach, but that he perhaps could be. As the Jerusalem Talmud states: \\"The Rabbis say, who is King Messiah? If he is from the living, David is his name, if he is from the deceased, David is still his name.\\" According to Moses Margolies, a commentator on the Jerusalem Talmud known as the Pnei Moshe, the Talmud rules that: \\"If he [the Messiah] is among the living, David will be his name, and if he is from among the dead, he is David himself\\".Brachot 2:4 Other rabbinic sages object to the notion that Mashiach will be someone who had once lived, died and was then resurrected. As Maimonides writes: \\"Even if one is worthy of being Mashiach, if he is killed it is certain that he is not Mashiach.\\" Expressions=Messianists The Messianist Flag in Jerusalem Subsequent to Schneerson's death, vocal messianists have continued to proclaim that Schneerson is still alive. Some of them argue that just as the Talmud states that \\"Jacob did not die\\" a teaching that carries great nuanced significance in kabbalistic thought, so too \\"Schneerson did not die\\".Igeret Hakodesh #27bDvar Malchut, Parashat Shoftim, 5751; Sefer Hisvaadiyus 1991 vol. 4 Page 204Example of Chabad exegesis on the death of a great man Among religious Jews, reference to one who has died is followed by expressions such as alav hashalom or zechuto yagen alenu. Messianists do not use such terms when writing of Schneerson.Telushkin, Rebbe: p. 429 Some messianists have even continued to use terms that indicate that Schneerson is still alive such as shlita. Generally speaking, the majority of this group consists of very vocal Israeli youth, particularly those educated in the city of Safed. There are also members of the messianic camp within the Crown Heights community and elsewhere who share these views. These individuals can usually be identified by the small yellow pin, known as the Moshiach flag worn on their lapel (or hat), and the Hebrew words of \\"Yechi\\" emblazoned on their kippot. Since Schneerson's death, Beis Moshiach magazine has been a major organ for views within this camp of the messianist. Between the years 1998-2004, the messianists have garnered support from rabbis to issue a rabbinic ruling supporting their messianic claims. These views have led to much controversy and condemnation.Telushkin, Rebbe: p. 431\\"Mosiach is here now: just open your eyes and you can see him\\" Simon Dein, Anthropology & Medicine, Volume 9, Number 1/April 01, 2002 Anti-Messianists Regardless of Schneerson's death, the majority of Chabad Hasidim continue to see him as the most righteous Jewish leader of the time, the nasi hador, whose influence throughout the world remains very palpable.Telushkin, Rebbe: p. 4233 They acknowledge that he died, visit his grave and observe yahrtzeit. They tend to place little or no emphasis on whether or not the Schneerson will be mashiach. Instead they focus on actually trying to carry out and fulfill Schneerson's vision of making the world a better place.Adin Steinsaltz My Rebbe page 274 They are aware of Schneerson's negative reactions when people tried making Messianic claims about him, and are acutely aware of how much Schneerson, their tzaddik ha'dor and their moshiach sh'b'dor, expects of them to accomplish both in the realm of their own personal service of God, in helping to bring the beauty of Judaism to Jews, and to spread the beauty of monotheism to the world at large. They hold that they have no way of knowing who will be the Moshiach, although they may wish it will be Schneerson. Variations According to some scholars, the messianist divisions in Chabad can be identified by various subtler factions of those who claim the Rebbe is not the messiah but could have been as he had all the qualities of a messiah prior to his death, whether the Rebbe was the Messiah and will be Messiah again once resurrected, whether the Rebbe is believed not to have died or is believed to be God.Dein, Simon, and Lorne L. Dawson. \\"The ‘scandal’of the Lubavitch Rebbe: messianism as a response to failed prophecy.\\" Journal of Contemporary Religion 23, no. 2 (2008): 163-180. Prevalence Crown Heights. The greatest criticism of Chabad messianism was leveled by David Berger. In a series or articles that were later published in his book The Rebbe, the Messiah, and the Scandal of Orthodox Indifference, Berger argued that there is no source in Jewish theology for the concept that a messiah will come, begin his mission, only to die, and then be resurrected to complete his mission. As a result of this, Berger argued that Chabad messianism, which he claimed was prevalent in majority of Chabad and its largest institutions, was beyond the pale of Orthodoxy and perhaps even heretical. His positions sparked much controversy in the Jewish world during the late 1990s and early 2000s. In his book he documents his efforts to mobilize other rabbis and rabbinical organizations to delegitimize Chabad. He concludes by recording his great frustrations in not being able to achieve this. Messianism is not advocated in any of Chabad's official literature..

Responses=Reaction to claims that Schneerson could be the Mashiach The reaction of many Torah scholars to the idea that Schneerson could be the Messiah varied. During his life, numerous rabbis and Jewish leaders, expressed their views that Menachem Mendel Schneerson had the potential to be the Messiah of the generation. There has been a general decline in that view since his death. Among those who stated that Schneerson had the potential to have been the mashiach is David Berger. Despite a sharp polemic against the vocal messianic movement that has proliferated since Schneerson's death, Berger has written that while Schneerson was alive \\"Judaism has never had a serious messianic candidate with the curriculum vitae of the Rebbe zt\\"l.

And did they not have followers? Did they not have a tradition? Were they not part of a long dynasty? They certainly did.\\" Lichtenstein continued and said that it seemed to him that Norman Lamm said of Schneerson that \\"If [people] believe the Rebbe could have been Moshiach, fine, I agree...

Weiss, November 11, 2005 Long time critics of Schneerson from Bnei Brak in Israel have been the most vocal in their criticism of Schneerson and Chabad. The most notable of these critics was Elazar Shach, the rosh yeshiva of the Ponevezh yeshiva. Shach was a known critic of Schneerson and the Chabad movement. He repeatedly attacked Schneerson and his followers on a number of issues, including messianism. When people became more vocal about the possibility of Schneerson being the Messiah, Shach advocated a complete boycott of Chabad.Faith and Fate: The Story of the Jewish People in the 20th century, Berel Wein, 2001 by Shaar Press. pg. 340The Messiah of Brooklyn: Understanding Lubavitch Hasidim Past and Present, M.

In America, numerous Litvish leaning rabbanim have also spoken negatively of this form of messianism, including Elya Svei, Aharon Feldman, Shlomo Miller, Moshe Heinemann and Chaim Dov Keller, who all issued harsh criticism. Feldman, quoting Maimonides, states that Other American Torah authorities, such as the Ungvarer Rav Menashe Klein, Moshe Heinemann, Yehuda Henkin, Chaim Brovender and Ahron Soloveichik argue that while there may be sources for messianism, it is a shtut (foolishness) that should not be followed.Can the Rebbe Be Moshiach?: Proofs from Gemara, Midrash, and Rambam That the Rebbe Cannot Be Gil Student, Universal-Publishers, 2002The Professor, Messiah, & Scandal of Calumnies Aaron Soloveichik Soloveichik's own written statements on the issue have themselves been the focus of controversy.

The \\"Yechi\\" statement \\"Yechi Adoneinu Moreinu v'Rabbeinu Melech haMoshiach l'olam vo'ed!\\" (יחי אדוננו מורנו ורבינו מלך המשיח לעולם ועד) is a phrase used by messianist Chabad Hasidism to proclaim that Schneerson is the messiah. It translates as \\"Long Live our Master, our Teacher, and our Rabbi, King Messiah, for ever.\\" The phrase can be seen printed in various settings, notably on pamphlets, posters and small cards and keyrings. It is chanted by messianists at the end of daily communal prayers in Lubavitch congregations, including the main Lubavitch synagogue in Crown Heights, \\"770\\". Yechi began as the phrase \\"Yechi Adoneinu Moreinu Verabbeinu,\\" (Long Live our master, teacher and Rebbe!) to which the response was a shout of \\"Yechi\\" (May he live!). It appears to be based on the statement made by Bathsheba, the wife of King David \\"Yechi adoni hamelech David le'olam,\\" (May my lord King David live forever!) (Kings I 1:31). When used by Lubavitcher Hasidim, it was originally recited in the presence of Schneerson after twelve special verses known as \\"the Twelve Pesukim\\" whose recitation the Rebbe encouraged in his teachings.

Its director was Michael James Rowland and its producers were Jo Dyer and Lesley Dyer.  Synopsis An Indonesian fishing boat abandons a group of Iraqi and Cambodian men on a remote part of the Western Australian coast in 1990. Told there is a bus over the dunes, the men are abandoned to a desert the size of Poland. While most are quickly rounded up, three men with little in common but their history of misfortune elude capture and begin an epic but confused journey drawn on by their hopes amplified by the empty desert. Pursued by an army reservist unit more concerned with playing ball sports and music, the three protagonists wander deeper into trouble, searching desperately among the harsh beauty of the Pilbara for evidence of a Western, liberal democracy or the promised bus, which only one of them finds.

High levels of non-sexual emotional intimacy in adults may occur without the participants being bound by other intimate relationships or may occur between people in other relationships. The term often describes a bond between two people that mimics the closeness and emotional intimacy of a romantic relationship while never being physically consummated. An emotional affair is sometimes referred to as an affair of the heart. An emotional affair may emerge from a friendship, and progress toward greater levels of personal intimacy and attachment. What distinguishes an emotional affair from a friendship is the assumption of emotional roles between the two participants that mimic of those of an actual relationship - with regards to confiding personal information and turning to the other person during moments of vulnerability or need. The intimacy between the people involved usually stems from a friendship with confidence to tell each other intimate aspects of themselves, their relationships, or even subjects they wouldn't discuss with their partners. Definition An emotional affair can be defined as: > \\"A relationship between a person and someone other than (their) spouse that > affects the level of intimacy, emotional distance and overall dynamic > balance in the marriage. The role of an affair is to create emotional > distance in the marriage.\\"Moultrup, David Husbands, Wives & Lovers: The > Emotional System of the Extramarital Affair New York: Guilford Press 1990. > Moultrup also contributed to 'The Handbook of the Clinical Treatment of > Infidelity' with editors Piercy, FP; Hertlein, KM and Wetchler, JL. Haworth. In this view, neither sexual intercourse nor physical affection is necessary to affect the committed relationship(s) of those involved in the affair. It is theorized that an emotional affair can injure a committed relationship more than a one night stand or other casual sexual encounters.Schutzwohl, Achim & Koch, Stephanie \\"Sex differences in jealousy: The recall of cues to sexual and emotional fidelity in personally more and less threatening context conditions.\\" Department of Psychology, University of Bielefeld, Germany 2004. Incidence and prevalence Research by Glass & Wright found that men's extramarital relationships were more sexual and women's more emotional. For both genders, sexual and emotional extramarital involvement occurred in those with the greatest marital dissatisfaction.Glass & Wright 'Sex differences in type of extramarital involvement and marital dissatisfaction Journal Sex Roles Publisher Springer Netherlands ISSN 0360-0025 (Print) 1573-2762 (Online) Issue Volume 12, Numbers 9-10 / May, 1985 Chaste and emotionally intimate affairs tend to be more common than sexually intimate affairs. Shirley Glass reported in Not \\"Just Friends\\" that 44% of husbands and 57% of wives indicated that in their affair they had a strong emotional involvement to the other person without intercourse.Shirley Glass S 'Not Just Friends - protect your relationship from infidelity and heal the trauma of betrayal' In University of Chicago surveys conducted by the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) between 1990 and 2002, 27% of people who reported being happy in marriage admitted to having an extramarital affair. The meaning and definition of what infidelity constitutes often varies depending on the person asked. Sexual feelings in an emotional affair are necessarily denied to maintain the illusion that it is just a special friendship. Affair surveys are unlikely to explore what is denied. Many people in affair surveys are not honest with themselves nor with the interviewer.Blow, Adrian J, Hartnett, Kelley \\"INFIDELITY IN COMMITTED RELATIONSHIPS II: A SUBSTANTIVE REVIEW\\" Journal of Marital and Family Therapy, April 2005, retrieved from Blow, Adrian J, Hartnett, Kelley \\"INFIDELITY IN COMMITTED RELATIONSHIPS I: A METHODOLOGICAL REVIEW Journal of Marital and Family Therapy, April 2005, retrieved from  Characteristics  This type of affair is often characterized by: * Unexpected emotional intimacy. The partner being unfaithful may spend inappropriate or excessive time with someone of the opposite or same gender (time not shared with the other partner). He or she may confide more in their new \\"friend\\" than in their partner and may share more intimate emotional feelings and secrets with their new partner than with their existing spouse. Any time that an individual invests more emotionally into a relationship with someone besides their partner the existing partnership may suffer.Jill Hubbard, The Secrets Women Keep (2008) p. 47-8 * Deception and secrecy. Those involved may not tell their partners about the amount of time they spend with each other. An individual involved in this type of affair may, for example, tell his or her spouse that they are doing other activities when they are really meeting with someone else. Or the unfaithful spouse may exclude any mention of the other person while discussing the day’s activities to conceal the rendezvous. Even if no physical intimacy occurs, the deception shows that those involved believe they are doing something wrong that undermines the existing relationship. In other words, if there was really no harm in meeting with a friend, both parties would feel comfortable telling their partners the truth about where they are meeting and what they are discussing.B. Schaeffer, Is it Love or is It Addiction (2013) p. 104 * Increased fighting. When a person becomes emotionally involved with someone and do not recognize it as a valid feeling, they may begin to channel their anger and disgust to diverse relationships, or to interpret different relationships in a dichotomized manner. This person may also rationalize a cause to something or someone, which can lead to increased fighting and strain on the relationships. * Sexual and emotional chemistry. Sexual and emotional chemistry can present itself based on a physical attraction one might feel for another person. This may or may not lead to physical intimacy. * Denial. Denial of the attraction and limerence felt may be exhibited by the cheating partner, but a similar denial and minimisation may also be defensively deployed by the excluded partner as well, to avoid confrontation.R. T. & P. S. Potter-Efron, The Emotional Affair (2008) p. 28 and p. 116 Cultural examples In Casanova's Chinese Restaurant, the composer Hugh Moreland, talking of an unlikely couple experiencing love at first sight, denies that they are having an affair: \\"You can have a passion for someone without having an affair. That is one of the things no one seems able to understand these days...one of those fascinating mutual attractions between improbable people that take place from time to time. I should like to write a ballet around it.\\"Anthony Powell, Casanova's Chinese Restaurant (1980) p. 54 Therapy as subset The entrance of a therapist into a couple's dynamics may be problematic. It may be experienced by the non-client partner as the client having an emotional affair with the therapist, if the client is perceived as granting the therapist a greater degree of intimacy and confiding than they grant the client's partner.Diane Vaughan, Uncoupling (1987) p. 212 The tendency to create a mate-substitute out of the therapist may be especially acute in incest survivors.Sam Kirschner, Working with Adult Incest Survivors (1993) p. 129 See also Notes  References  * Pittman, F.

It is best known for selling unauthorized copies of commercial recordings by other artists as the work of pianists Sergio Fiorentino and Barrington-Coupe's wife, Joyce Hatto. Barrington-Coupe's long history in the music world includes time with Saga Films and Records and pop record producer Joe Meek. The company issued recordings from 1955 until 2007. Fraudulent recordings The Concert Artist label received increased attention in its final years as it released over 100 CDs of highly acclaimed piano recordings attributed to Joyce Hatto. After a great deal of speculation, discussion and allegations, on 26 February 2007 Barrington-Coupe admitted fraud and plagiarism regarding his recently deceased wife's recent recordings. Joyce Hatto CDs released by Concert Artist are in fact plagiarised commercial recordings by other pianists on different labels. Some light editing and processing had been made to the Concert Artist releases in an effort to disguise the original recordings origin. Some of the Concert Artist recordings attributed to Sergio Fiorentino have also been positively identified as previously released commercial recordings by other pianists. The Concert Artist release of Chopin's Mazurkas attributed to Alfred Cortot has been the subject of continuing debate since before the \\"Hatto hoax\\". Subsequent analyses of the Cortot recordings have concluded that there are \\"ample grounds for suspicion\\" that the recordings are not authentic, but the actual source recording has never been identified.

It is the fourth of the six \\"Inner Sanctum\\" mystery films. Plot summary Alex Gregor (Chaney) is a performing mentalist known as \\"Gregor the Great\\". One night on stage, placing his own fiancé into a hypnotic trance, he is ridiculed by a skeptical member of the audience (Hohl), who claims it's all done with mirrors. Simultaneously, the show is aired to a radio audience. The man, clearly plastered, starts accusing Alex of being a fake. Alex reacts by hypnotizing the man, ending up accidentally killing him. Even though the medical examiner concludes that the drunken man died from a heart attack, Alex is riddled with guilt and confesses to have murdered the man. Ashamed of what he has done, he breaks off the engagement to his girlfriend and assistant, Maura Daniel (Ankers). George Keene (Milburn Stone), who is Alex's manager, arranges for him to work for an old friend, Mme Valerie Monet (Tala Birell). She is the owner of a wax museum and Alex is hired as a lecturer. Valerie's niece, Nina Coudreau (Elena Verdugo), is also working at the museum, and they are both very excited to have a man with Alex's gifts working with them. There is also a disturbed former plastic surgeon Rudi Poldan (Martin Kosleck), on the payroll, working as a sculptor. This odd physician becomes jealous of the attention given to Alex. Maura reappears and attempts to woo Gregor back. Jealousy spreads, infecting Valerie, who falsely accuses Alex of making advances to Nina, her niece. Arguments ensue, ending with Valerie fainting and Alex leaving in anger. Following a night's sleep, Alex returns to find that Valerie has disappeared. Police Inspector Brant (Douglass Dumbrille) suspects that Valerie has been murdered, believing Alex to be the last person to have seen Valerie alive. All are unaware that Rudi has found Valerie in a coma and hidden her away among his unfinished wax sculptures. Nina suspects Alex of scheming with the crazy surgeon to be rid of Valerie. What they don't know is that Rudi has planned to get Alex committed as mentally ill, and the mastermind of this ingenious plan is none other than Alex's manager, George. The reason is to gain control over Alex's property. Rudi manages to make Nina fall into a coma and hides her body in the same manner as was done with Valerie. Rudi shows George where he has placed the bodies of the two women. They discover that Valerie is dead. Now guilty of murder, George becomes frantic, wanting to get rid of both of the bodies, even though Nina is still alive. Alex decides the only person he can trust is Maura, who agrees to help. Alex places Maura in a trance and she implicates both George and Rudi (using the psychic abilities granted to her by the trance, as demonstrated in the opening scene of the film). Trying to escape, George is captured by Brant, who has heard Maura's every word. Alex and Maura go to the museum cellar to free Nina and encounter Rudi. In the ensuing struggle with Gregor, Rudi falls backward into the furnace to his death. The story ends with Alex and Maura married and on their way to their honeymoon, together with Nina, their new ward. Brant visits and asks Alex for help with a case, as a medical consultant. Alex answers: \\"Oh, Inspector, I thought you knew.

It serves researchers, policymakers, and members of the private sector and civil society, from students to well-established practitioners. Purpose and organization The purpose of the conference is to acquaint those active in the policy-making field with the best of recent research and to familiarize researchers with the knowledge requirements of public policymakers and the various affected industries. The conference consists of panelists who present papers selected based on abstracts, as well as discussion panels and keynote speakers; the Program Committee of TPRC is responsible for the selection of all papers and presenters. The Conference is organized by TPRC, Inc., a non-profit organization incorporated in the District of Columbia. TPRC is governed by an international board of Directors, consisting of individuals from the academy, industry, government, and non- profit sectors. The conference program is organized by a Program Committee. Topics TPRC welcomes legal, economic, social, and technical research affecting every aspect of national and international policy on communications, information, and the Internet, including but not limited to: voice, video, and data communications using wireline and wireless networks; traditional mass media including radio and television broadcasting, cable- and satellite- delivered communication; the growth and evolution of the Internet ecosystem; technological convergence and its implications for statutes, regulations, and treaties; intellectual property; electronic commerce; privacy and cybersecurity; and the role of communications, information, and the Internet in economic development. The conference program includes papers, posters, panels, keynote speeches, a Student Paper Competition, the Graduate Student Consortium, and the Charles Benton Early Career Scholar Award.

As communications policy has grown in importance to where the very term “telecommunications” is inadequate, the conference has evolved and expanded. TPRC saw the birth of the discourse on spectrum auctions. TPRC offered the first panel on the social and political implications of e-commerce in 1994. Conference topics have increasingly emphasized the interaction among disciplines, including network science and engineering, economics, law, and social sciences.

She was a member of the Swedish Academy from 1944.  Biography  Elin Wägner was born in Lund, Sweden as the daughter of a school principal, Wägner was only 3 years old when her mother died. Wägner's books and articles focus on the subjects of women's emancipation, civil rights, votes for women, the peace movement, welfare, and environmental pollution. She is best known for her commitment to the women's suffrage movement in Sweden, National Association for Women's Suffrage, for founding the Swedish organization Rädda Barnen (the Swedish chapter of the International Save the Children Alliance) and for developing the women's citizen school at Fogelstad (where she was also a teacher on civil rights). Alongside Fredrika Bremer, Wägner is often seen as the most important and influential feminist pioneer in Sweden. 1920s feminists Left to right: Elisabeth Tamm, Ada Nilsson, Kerstin Hesselgren (sitting), Honorine Hermelin and Elin Wägner Wägner was the launching editor of the weekly political magazine Tidevarvet and headed the magazine from 1924 to 1927. A prolific writer, Wägner wrote novels, articles in various daily newspapers and screenplays for a number of films. Among Wägner's most popular novels — which continue to be read — are: Norrtullsligan (\\"Men and Other Misfortunes\\", 1908), Pennskaftet (\\"The Penholder\\", 1910), Åsa-Hanna (1918), Kvarteret Oron (\\"Stormy Corner\\", 1919), Silverforsen (\\"The Silver Rapids\\", 1924), Vändkorset (\\"The Turnstile\\", 1934), Väckarklocka (\\"Alarm Clock\\", 1941) and Vinden vände bladen (\\"The Wind Turned The Pages\\", 1947).

Biography A native of the New Hampshire town of Plymouth, Nathaniel Peabody Rogers was the fifth child of Harvard-educated physician and poet, John Rogers (March 27, 1755 – March 8, 1814), and his wife, Betsy Mulliken. Young Nathaniel entered Dartmouth College in 1811 but, within a few months, suffered severe internal damage while participating in a game of football, and was forced to withdraw for a year of recuperation, with the injuries continuing as a source of pain for the remainder of his life, ultimately contributing to his death at age 52. Returning to Dartmouth, he graduated in 1816, studied law with Salisbury attorney and future Massachusetts congressman Richard Fletcher until 1819, and was admitted to the New Hampshire Bar that year. In 1838, giving up a lucrative 19-year legal practice in his native Plymouth and moving to Concord, he became editor of the abolitionist newspaper Herald of Freedom, to which he had been contributing articles since its 1835 founding by the New Hampshire Anti-Slavery Society. His editorial writings, noted for an impulsive, unaffected and witty, sometimes sarcastic, style as well as for poetic descriptions of nature, were widely reprinted in New York Tribune and other anti-slavery newspapers, under pen name \\"The Old Man of the Mountain\\".Profile of Nathaniel Peabody Rogers at New Hampshire Division of Historical Resources In 1840, he represented New Hampshire abolitionists in London at the World Anti-Slavery Convention, but he withdrew in protest when the Convention refused to seat American women delegates.

Includes link {within chapter 2 of Parker Pillsbury's Acts of the Anti-Slavery Apostles} to photograph of Rogers' gravestone in Concord Cemetery Four months before his death, sensing failing health, Rogers wrote to his old friend, the poet John Greenleaf Whittier, \\"I am striving to get me an asylum of a farm. I have a wife and seven children, every one of them with a whole spirit. I don't want to be separated from any of them, only with a view to come together again. I have a beautiful little retreat in prospect, forty odd miles north, where I imagine I can get potatoes and repose,—a sort of haven or port. I am among the breakers, and 'mad for land.' If I get this home,—it is a mile or two in among the hills from the pretty domicil once visited by yourself and glorious Thompson,—I am this moment indulging the fancy that I may see you at it before we die.\\" Whittier published a posthumous profile of his anti-slavery compatriot as a chapter in the 1850 literary collection, Old Portraits and Modern Sketches.Biographical reminiscence of Nathaniel Peabody Rogers in John Greenleaf Whittier's Old Portraits and Modern Sketches NotesReferences *Bell, Charles H.

The film stars Evelyn Ankers, John Carradine, Milburn Stone, and features Acquanetta as Paula, the Ape Woman. The film involves a scientist, Dr. Sigmund Walters, whose experiments turn a female gorilla named Cheena into a human by injecting the ape with sex hormones and via brain transplants. Captive Wild Woman was initially announced by Universal Pictures in 1940 with several promotional campaigns that did not reflect what ended up in the film. The film was intended to start filming in 1941 and January 1942, but only began filming in December 1942, ending in production the following year. The film received lukewarm reviews from The New York Times, The New York Daily News and Harrison's Reports who only recommended the film to horror fans. It was followed by two sequels in the 1940s: Jungle Woman and The Jungle Captive. Plot An animal trainer Fred Mason (Milburn Stone) returns from his latest safari with a horde of animals for his employer John Whipple (Lloyd Corrigan), owner of the Whipple Circus. Among them is Cheela (Ray Corrigan), a gorilla with remarkably human characteristics. Mason relates that she is the most affectionate jungle animal he has ever encountered. Mason's fiancée Beth Colman (Evelyn Ankers) is present at the dock for his return. She tells him of the recent health problems encountered by her sister Dorothy (Martha MacVicar). Beth reflects on taking her sibling to see Dr. Sigmund Walters (John Carradine), an endocrinologist of some standing. Dorothy is staying at Walters’ Crestview Sanatorium for treatment. Fred and Beth arrive at the winter quarters, and Dr. Walters pays a visit. He is extremely interested in Cheela, and inquires about purchasing her. Whipple tells him that she is not for sale. Upon returning to his lab, Walters finds that his latest experiment has resulted in the lab animal's death. He becomes convinced he needs larger animals that possess the “will to live.” Walters enlists the aid of a disgruntled former circus employee to steal Cheela. After the ape is loaded onto his truck, the scientist callously pushes the man into the gorilla's grasp and stolidly watches as the beast wrings his neck. Back at his lab, Walters and his assistant Miss Strand (Fay Helm) transplant glandular material from Dorothy into Cheela. There was discussion by Miss Strand that Walters has previously grafted the glands of different animals like placing a guinea pig's glands into a rabbit and a frog's glands into a mouse. To the horror of the nurse, the ape transforms into human form (Acquanetta). Telling the doctor that she cannot allow him to continue, Miss Strand informs him that at best he will have “a human form, with animal instincts.” Dr. Walters reaches the conclusion that he will need to place a human brain into his creation to successfully complete his experiment. He sacrifices Miss Strand for this purpose. The brain transplant is a success, and the result is a sultry and exotic young woman who remembers nothing of her previous existence. Walters names her Paula Dupree, and takes his creation to the winter quarters for her first public outing. While watching Mason practice his animal act, an accident occurs. Paula rushes into the cage and saves him from the ferocious felines, who display an unnatural fear of her and retreat from her presence. Mason is dumbfounded and offers the girl a job in his act. After the final dress rehearsal, Paula becomes jealous of Mason's fiancée. She goes to her dressing room and while having a tantrum, begins converting to animal form. Later that night, she climbs through Beth's window planning to kill her, but attacks and brutally murders another woman instead. The beast returns to Walters, and the doctor realizes that another operation is necessary to return her to human form. He can continue to use Dorothy for the glandular material, but will need yet another subject to replace Paula's damaged cerebrum. Beth receives a frantic telephone call from her sister who expresses her fear of Dr. Walters and the forthcoming operation. Arriving at the Sanatorium to aid her sister, Beth is pegged by the good doctor as the next brain donor for Cheela. However, she proves resourceful in a pinch, releasing the ape from its cage. Cheela does Walters in and departs the lab, leaving Beth and Dorothy unharmed. Performing his animal act solo, Mason finds himself trapped inside the cage with his unruly subjects. A powerful storm interrupts the performance and the beasts attack the trainer. Cheela comes to his rescue once again and carries him to safety. Unfortunately, a nearby police officer mistakes her intentions and kills Cheela. CastProduction Captive Wild Woman was announced as a film more than two years before its release with an initial starting date to be on August 8, 1941. Two distinctly different concepts of the character appeared in preview advertisements for the film. One from July 29 featured a furiously woman while a second showed a more exotic woman holding a knife running through the jungle. Neither film showcased the hybrid ape-woman film that would be released. A second starting date with George Waggner producing was set for January 2, 1942, which also did not come to pass. When the original script of the proposed film, which included the transplant of a living brain into an ape, was submitted for review under the Motion Picture Production Code, the Production Code Administration suggested several changes so that only a partial brain transplant would occur. The reason for the change, to which the studio did not object, was apparently to eliminate any possible implication that a human soul might transfer into an animal and violate religious doctrine. Among the cast was John Carradine as Dr. Sigmund Walters. Director Edward Dmytryk referred to Carradine as having always been \\"kind of a ham\\" but that he \\"had a little talk with him and I think we got a very controlled performance out of him for a mad scientist!\\" The ape in the film was played by Ray \\"Crash\\" Corrigan who began his career as a stuntman with a few starring roles in serials like Undersea Kingdom and B-Westerns. Corrigan had several gorilla costumes created for him personally, as he had previously played apes in Murder in the Private Car, The Ape and would go on to do several other Ape-roles in the 1940s. Acquanetta who plays Paula Dupree was previously a model in New York after graduating high school and had a story fabricated that she was from Venezuela to hide her Arapaho background. On her was to perform in South America, she stopped over in Hollywood meeting the head of Warner Bros. and Universal, Dan Kelley and Walter Wanger respectively. She was cast in small roles in Arabian Nights and Rhythm of the Islands, while Universal presented themselves as \\"introducing\\" her in Captive Wild Woman. Acquanetta recalled that there was no preparation for her part but got along with the rest of the cast and crew, even dating director Dmytryk briefly. The film only went into production on December 10, 1942, with production halting during the December holiday season and continuing again in January. It was directed by the Canadian-born film editor turned director Edward Dmytryk. Prior to directing the film, Dmytryk work on several B-films such as the Boris Karloff film The Devil Commands for Columbia Pictures. Dmytryk made Captive Wild Woman while being on loan from RKO Radio Pictures to Universal Pictures Company, Inc. Release Captive Wild Woman was released on June 4, 1943. Captive Wild Woman was part of Universal's series of three films featuring Cheena, the Ape Woman. Despite being named Cheela in Captive Wild Woman, she is renamed Cheena in the subsequent films. The sequels included Jungle Woman and Jungle Captive. The film was released for the first time on DVD by Universal Studios on September 13, 2009, as a part of its two- disk \\"Universal Horror: Classic Movie Archive\\". It was later released by Willette Acquisition Corp. on March 17, 2015. Captive Wild Woman was for released on blu ray by Scream Factory on June 16, 2020 as the fifth volume in their Universal Horror Collection, along with Jungle Woman, The Monster and the Girl and Jungle Captive. Reception From contemporary reviews, Thomas M. Pryor of The New York Times stated the film \\"[S]hould not let thrill- seekers down\\" while \\"there is nothing to recommend in the story or the performances....The picture as a whole is in decidedly bad taste.\\" Wanda Hale of The New York Daily News declared the film as a \\"thing of horror... Unless you like pictures of this type we won't recommend Captive Wild Woman. If you do, you'll get your money's worth in thrills.\\" A reviewer in Harrison's Reports described as \\"another one of those implausible horror melodramas, suitable as a supporting feature in situations where this type of entertainment is acceptable\\" noting that \\"Acquanetta, a new screen personality is effective as the ape woman. The action provides plenty of thrills and suspense.\\" From retrospective reviews, Dennis Schwartz from Ozus' World Movie Reviews rated the film a grade B, writing \\"Though it clearly defies reason, the lively thriller has a fine sinister performance by Carradine and a crazy tale to spin that is strangely palpable.\\" References=FootnotesSources External links  1943 films 1943 horror films 1940s science fiction horror films American films American black-and-white films American science fiction horror films Circus films English-language films Films about apes Films directed by Edward Dmytryk Universal Pictures films ","title":"Captive Wild Woman"},{"id":"9618942","text":"Daniel Dye Johnson was an officer in the Union Army during the American Civil War.

And many in the West were predicting that scientific progress would eliminate religious belief altogether by the next century...In this accessible intellectual history, McGrath explores how atheism came to capture a wide swath of the public imagination as the road to human liberation and progress, and why, in a postmodern world, its appeal has faded. Yet he also makes clear that, despite the resurgence in faith, Western Christianity has not fully recovered from the crisis of the '60s.\\"A funny thing happened on way to disbelief * Claire Berlinski in the Hoover Institution's Policy Review suggests that \\"one wishes McGrath had made his case with greater precision and care. He offers scant sociological data and few statistics about rates of religious belief over this period.\\" She doubts whether \\"post-modernism will provide a nurturing climate for theists.... If he is still prepared to make this case after a weekend spent sharing the Good News at the annual Modern Language Association Convention, I am prepared to listen.\\" She comments that \\"The object of his historic inquiry is not atheism per se but one particular and influential strand of it: a conjunction of so-called hard atheism — the explicit denial of the existence of God, as opposed to mere lack of belief — with a series of beliefs that exceed any ontological claims about God to encompass moral and political arguments for the eradication of theism. Only this species of atheism, thus defined, is by his reckoning cast in twilight. As a limited case it is somewhat successful — who can dispute that atheist regimes failed to cover themselves in glory, or that strident atheists are a particularly unattractive bunch? ... But McGrath defines atheism so narrowly that the most interesting questions are unaddressed and unresolved, and his ebullient conclusions are unsupported by the arguments.\\"Claire Berlinski Policy Review Feb & March 2005 Is God Still Dead? * Ben Rogers in the Financial Times concluded that \\"It strikes me as a little alarming that the Professor of Historical Theology at Oxford University could write such a careless, tendentious, almost unscrupulous book. I hope he is not representative of the state of academic theology at large.\\"Ben Rogers The Godless in Financial Times 8 November 2004. Available online here * Tim O'Neil writes: \\"But throughout his history McGrath offers more puzzling elisions and leaps of logic. The most serious is his insistence on discussing atheism as a\`\\"faith\\", treating it in the context of history like just another of many competing spiritual enterprises. He is correct in assuming that the claim is \\"astonishing\\" to many atheists, because despite his philosophical maneuverings he simply fails to make the argument anything less than an oxymoron. (..) Believing in God or any supernatural agency therefore requires that the believer make an external assumption. To say that the act of not believing in God is similarly an article of faith is to misread the question entirely, to presuppose that an awareness of divinity is in fact the default position for human intellect to take -- quite a leap, but McGrath isn’t the only one to make it (..) In conflating the concepts of atheism and the conventional understanding of \\"faith\\", McGrath also makes another crucial error -- mistaking atheism, an idea, with atheism as a mass movement. (..) The fact that Stalin just happened to be an atheist has no impact on the legitimacy of the idea than the fact that Torquemada just happened to be a Christian impacts the legitimacy of Christianity\\".The Twilight of Atheism by Alister McGrath, Tim O'Neil 15 December 2006, PopMatters * The National Review wrote, \\"McGrath is an engaging, anecdote loving writer with irenic sympathy for all his subjects, even the atheists, whose classic critique of Christianity as intolerant and corruption-prone he believes has spurred the churches to reform themselves in positive ways. I found him a shade too irenic. McGrath properly celebrates the passing of secular modernity but goes on to give too much credit to the postmodernist theorists who helped push modernity over the edge. He seems to forget that Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault, and their epigones are also militant atheists, with all the intolerance and totalitarian tendencies of that breed, and that academic postmodernism rests upon a Marxist substrate as surely as did Stalinism. Even more distressing is the scant attention that McGrath pays to the highly credentialed and supremely self-confident Richard Dawkinses of the world. Science and religion need not be in conflict, but it remains the case (as McGrath himself notes) that atheistic scientific materialism is the religion of a strong plurality, perhaps the majority, of the world's scientists. They want to be known not as atheists but as \\"brights,\\" smarter than and superior to the rest of us. The claims of such scientists—that their own interests and desires as the unacknowledged legislators of the world should prevail without restraint—are currently being played out in the political debate over government funding for embryonic stem cell research. I wish that McGrath had entertained the possibility that atheism, while undoubtedly in philosophical and demographic twilight, may yet be experiencing a new dawn: a terrifying new alliance with money and power, of a kind even Marx could not have foreseen.\\"National Review v. 56 no. 17 (September 13, 2004) p. 51-2.

In Alabama, the Interstate Highway runs from I-65 in Montgomery northeast to the Georgia state line near Valley. I-85 is the primary highway between Montgomery and Atlanta. The Interstate also connects Montgomery with Tuskegee, Auburn, Opelika, and, indirectly, Phenix City and Columbus, Georgia. Route description I-85 begins at a six-ramp modified directional-T interchange with I-65 southwest of downtown Montgomery. In addition to the ramps to and from I-65, the terminating Interstate's dual carriageways continue west a short distance and become Day Street; the interchange also includes a ramp from southbound I-65 to Day Street and from Day Street to northbound I-65. I-85 heads east toward downtown Montgomery as an eight-lane freeway. The highway has a pair of half- diamond interchanges with Court Street (northbound exit, southbound entrance) and Union Street (southbound exit, northbound entrance). The one-way pair of Arba Street and South Street serve as frontage roads for the northbound and southbound lanes, respectively, along the southern edge of downtown. The interchanges provide access to the Alabama State Capitol and Alabama State University. Southeast of downtown Montgomery, I-85 has a pair of half- interchanges with Forest Avenue (northbound exit, southbound entrance) and Mulberry Street (southbound exit, northbound entrance). I-85 leaves the core of Montgomery and has a diamond interchange with Ann Street and a six-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange with Perry Hill Road. The freeway's next junction is with East Boulevard, which forms part of a circumferential highway around Montgomery; the partial cloverleaf interchange includes a flyover ramp from northbound East Boulevard to southbound I-85. East Boulevard carries US 231 and Alabama State Route 21 (SR 21) through the interchange and US 80 south from the interchange; US 80 joins I-85 heading east from Montgomery. I-85's interchange with SR 271 provides access to Auburn University at Montgomery. The Interstate drops to four lanes between SR 271 and the next interchange with SR 110 and SR 126 (Atlanta Highway), where the route leaves the city of Montgomery. I-85 and US 80 parallel SR 126 east through the community of Mount Meigs and through an unused directional-T interchange with State Route 108, which is also future I-85. This is among the largest and tallest interchanges in the state, featuring SR 126 & SR 293 on both sides of the Interstate and freeway state route. US 80 splits east onto Atlanta Highway at a diamond interchange, and I-85 heads east-north-east, leaving Montgomery County and entering Macon County at Line Creek. Another access to US 80 is provided at Shorter via an interchange with unsigned SR 138. The Interstate meets the southern end of SR 229 south of SR 229's crossing of the Tallapoosa River and the southern end of SR 49 near the town of Franklin. I-85's interchange with SR 81 connects the freeway with the Macon County seat of Tuskegee and Tuskegee University. The Interstate's final access to US 80 is via SR 186 (Wire Road), beyond which the freeway passes through a portion of Tuskegee National Forest. I-85 continues northeast into Lee County. On the southern edge of Auburn, the freeway has an interchange with Auburn Technology Parkway. US 29 joins I-85 at its next interchange with College Street; SR 147 continues north along College Street toward Auburn University. I-85 and US 29 continue northeast through the city to an interchange with Bent Creek Road, which provides access to Auburn University Regional Airport. The freeway continues northeast into the city of Opelika, the county seat of Lee County. I-85 gains a second U.S. Highway concurrency at its four-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange with Gateway Drive, where US 280 joins from the north. The three highways cross over a Norfolk Southern Railway line just west of their four-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange with SR 51 and SR 169 south of downtown Opelika. I-85 North exit 70 toward Cusseta, Alabama US 280 splits east toward Phenix City and Columbus at the next interchange with US 431. US 29 diverges from I-85 at the following interchange, and the Interstate leaves the city of Opelika beyond its junction with Andrews Road. The interstate enters Chambers County at its interchange with County Road 388 (CR 388), which leads to Cusseta. I-85 meets CR 208 in the unincorporated area of Huguley west of the city of Valley. Southbound I-85 has a welcome center between CR 208 and the freeway's final interchange in Alabama, a junction with US 29 between the cities of Valley to the south and Lanett to the north. I-85 crosses the Chattahoochee River on its way toward LaGrange and Atlanta. History The construction of the downtown part of the interstate in Montgomery destroyed a significant part of the traditionally African-American community in that area. Future An extension of Interstate 85 is proposed west from Montgomery to interchange with Interstate 20 and Interstate 59 just east of the Mississippi-Alabama state line,Volkert and Associates, I-85 Extension Corridor Study & EUIS where it will connect with I-20 and I-59 near Cuba, Alabama. This extension will roughly follow the route of U.S. 80, going through or bypassing Selma and Demopolis.Hinnen, Jerry. Shelby shares views with Hale, Greene counties Posted by the Demopolis Times, January 17, 2005. The FHWA approved the alignment on February 17, 2011 after AASHTO approved at its Fall 2010 meeting in Biloxi, Mississippi. Also approved was the proposal to re-designate part of existing I-85 south and east of Montgomery to be bypassed as part of the extension of I-85 as I-685. Alabama has permission to co-sign this part of I-85 as I-685 until the new alignment is built.FHWA letter downloaded from http://cms.transportation.org/sites/route/docs/Alabama%20Interstate%20FHWA%20Decision%20Letter.pdf April 14, 2011 This section is also envisioned by some as part of a proposed Interstate 14. If this extension were to be completed, I-85 and I-20 would meet each other twice and the extension of I-85 would run east-west.

Slave-trading voyages Sailing out of Newport, Rhode Island Hope was involved in bringing Africans to the United States to be sold as slaves as part of the Middle Passage. Hope was under the command of Captain Nathaniel Mumford, when she sailed from Newport, Rhode Island, on 12 November 1764, bound for Senegambia and the offshore Atlantic islands. She arrived there in January 1765 and proceeded to purchase slaves at the Gambia.Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database Voyages: Hope (Mumford). On March 17, 1765, a revolt occurred on the ship: > There was a passenger revolt aboard the brigantine Hope while it was > bringing slaves from the coast of Senegal and Gambia to Connecticut. How did > that happen? –Well, the captain, who had beaten several of his crewmen, had > been killed and his body thrown overboard, and so the black cargo, seeing > such discord among their captors, figured they maybe had a chance. In their > revolt they killed one crew member and wounded several others. On this day > their revolt was suppressed by killing seven of them. Hope had embarked 83 slaves and she landed 18 at Barbados in June. She then sailed to Newport where she arrived on 5 December. There she landed another 51. In all, she landed 69 out of 83 slaves, for a loss rate of 16.9%. Captain Mumford sailed Hope from Rhode Island on 2 June 1766. she arrived at Cape Coast Castle on 22 October and purchased 100 slaves there. She left on 22 November, and arrived back at Rhode Island on 2 February 1767. There she landed 95 slaves, for a loss rate of 5%. Another account has her landing 100 slaves to Rhode Island. Revolutionary War During America's War for Independence, Hope was used for several purposes. In 1780 a ship named Hope was used as a hospital prison ship by the British. It was also used to ship British Loyalists to New Brunswick.American Prisoners of the Revolution: Names of 8000 Men. American Merchant Marine at War. Retrieved February 20, 2008. Later voyages In August 1795, merchant John Brown of Providence, Rhode Island conspired to trade in slaves with Captain Peleg Wood. Hope was the ship to be used, however the United States had recently limited participation in the international slave trade by Congressional action in 1794. By November Hope was engaged in the slave trade again. Next in March 1796, the owners of the ship were fined by Rhode Island the amount of £200 for trading in slaves, which had been outlawed in that state. Then on October 5, 1797, Brown became the first American tried in federal court under the Slave Trade Act of 1794 for using Hope in the African slave trade. On that voyage in 1796 the Hope had traveled to Havana, Cuba, with 229 slaves. After the forced sale, during the Quasi-War with France, Hope was captured by French privateers. At this time the vessel was under the command of John Rodgers, who had served on board the , and was owned by Baltimore merchant James Buchanan. After capture the Hope, which had been transporting tobacco, was sold at Lorient in February 1797.

In Virginia, the Interstate Highway runs from the North Carolina state line near Bracey north to I-95 in Petersburg. I-85 passes through the eastern part of Southside Virginia, where it parallels U.S. Route 1 (US 1) from Petersburg, where the highway runs concurrently with US 460, to south of South Hill, where the highway intersects Southside's major east-west highway, US 58. The Interstate Highway is the primary connection between the Richmond-Petersburg metropolitan area and the Research Triangle and other major metropolitan areas of North Carolina. Like all mainline Interstate Highways, I-85 is a part of the National Highway System for its entire length in Virginia. Route description I-85 enters Virginia in Mecklenburg County southwest of Bracey. The Interstate Highway continues southwest toward Henderson and Durham. Northbound I-85 has a welcome center before the highway crosses Lake Gaston, an impoundment of the Roanoke River, on a causeway and bridge before reaching an interchange with SR 903 at Bracey. The freeway passes through the town of South Hill, where the highway has a cloverleaf interchange with US 58 (Atlantic Avenue). US 58 serves as the major east-west highway of Southside Virginia; the U.S. Highway provides access to La Crosse, Brodnax, Lawrenceville, and Emporia to the east and Boydton and Clarksville to the west. US 58 leads to SR 47, which provides access to Chase City. North of the town of South Hill, I-85 has a junction with US 1 (Mecklenburg Avenue), which parallels the Interstate Highway from Henderson to Petersburg. The US 1 interchange also provides access to SR 138, which heads north toward Kenbridge. View north along I-85 north of the SR 644 exit in Brunswick County North of US 1, I-85 enters Brunswick County just before the highway crosses the Meherrin River. The Interstate Highway has an interchange with SR 644 (Brunswick Drive) at Meredithville and a partial interchange with SR 46 (Christanna Highway) before the freeway crosses to the east side of US 1 (Boydton Plank Road) at an interchange southwest of the town of Alberta. The SR 46 and US 1 interchanges provide access to St. Paul's College in Lawrenceville and the Christanna campus of Southside Virginia Community College at the SR 46-US 1 intersection. Northeast of Alberta, I-85 has rest areas in both directions and interchanges with SR 630 (Sturgeon Road) at Sturgeonville and SR 712 (Old Stage Road) near Rawlings. I-85 crosses the Nottoway River into Dinwiddie County southwest of its interchanges with SR 40 (McKenney Highway) near the town of McKenney and SR 650 (Hamilton Arms Road) at DeWitt. The Interstate Highway serves Dinwiddie via its partial cloverleaf interchange with SR 703 (Carson Road) just east of the county seat of Dinwiddie County and another pair of rest areas. The Dinwiddie interchange and the following interchange with US 460 (Cox Road) provide access to Virginia Motorsports Park. At the partial cloverleaf interchange with US 460, which also leads to Dinwiddie County Airport, the Interstate Highway and U.S. Highway start to run concurrently toward Petersburg. Both the US 460 interchange and the following partial cloverleaf junction with US 1 (Boydton Plank Road) provide access to the National Museum of the Civil War Soldier at Pamplin Historical Park. East of US 1, the freeway curves to the east and changes from having a wide, forested median to a Jersey barrier separating the twin carriageways. I-85 enters the city of Petersburg prior to its junction with Squirrel Level Road. South of downtown Petersburg, I-85 reaches its northern terminus at a trumpet interchange with I-95. The southern end of the interchange has a ramp from northbound I-85 to southbound I-95. Here, US 460 joins I-95 south through an interchange with US 301 (Crater Road), south of which the U.S. Highway separates from I-95 on its way to Norfolk. I-85 curves north and merges with I-95 in the direction of Richmond adjacent to the loop ramp from northbound I-95 to southbound I-85. Just before merging with northbound I-95, I-85 has its final exit, a ramp that leads to the one-way pair of eastbound Wythe Street and westbound Washington Street in Historic Old Towne Petersburg. Wythe Street leads to Petersburg National Battlefield; Fort Lee, which contains the Army Quartermaster Museum and Army Women's Museum; and the city of Hopewell via SR 36.

It is also known as the Bowenfels Railway Station and Stationmaster's House and Old Station Masters Residence and Station. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. The sandstone station opened on 18 October 1869 with the construction of the railway and was electrified in 1957 as part of the Blue Mountains line electrification programme. The electrification was to continue to Wallerawang but was curtailed west of Bowenfels station.Bowenfels Station NSWrail.net On 14 August 1972, the station staff were removed and two of the three daily passenger services were cut back to Lithgow, with the remaining service following on 21 September 1974 and the station closed.\\"20 Years Ago\\" Railway Digest August 1992 page 323 In 1989, with State Rail Authority road coaches causing congestion around Lithgow station, one of the solutions considered was building an interchange at Bowenfels and reinstating electric services from Sydney.\\"SRA Buses Cause Trouble in Lithgow\\" Railway Digest May 1989 page 172 This wasn't pursued with an interchange being built at Lithgow instead.

The village of Bowenfels forms an outer suburb of the industrial centre of Lithgow. The completion of the Zig Zag railway across the Blue Mountains with its western terminus at Bowenfels provided the impetus for the growth of the area and the industrial development that followed. The single track main line through Bowenfels was opened in 1869 as part of the Sydney- Bathurst line which reached Bathurst in 1876. The line was constructed during the first major period of New South Wales railway building, 1854–88, and played a particularly significant role in the development of the Bowenfels area, paving the way for the exploitation of local coal reserves, thus leading to the development of Lithgow as a mining and industrial centre. The station was opened on 18 October the same year as the line, constructed to designs by the railway engineer, John Clifton, with building works contracted to G. Watsford. For five years it was the only station for Lithgow Valley and the railway line was single-track until the line was duplicated from Zig Zag Bottom Points to Bowenfels in 1880 and beyond Bowenfels to Middle River in 1921, by which latter date a second side platform was provided. The platform stone building and stone Station Master's residence were both erected for the line opening in 1869. The design of both accorded with the standard practice that was in vogue in the 1860s, though use of stone for NSW railway platform buildings, as well as on the stone-faced Bourke-bound platform, was rare and indicated the importance of the station at the time of construction. Built on simple rectangular plan with verandah front and rear, the station included a ladies' waiting room, main waiting room, ticket office and Station Master's office. Housed in small rooms on either side were the luggage room and ladies' washroom. The gentlemen's toilet was a smaller room adjoining the ladies' washroom. A fireplace positioned in each room catered for the comfort of passengers. A Gatekeeper's cottage was also built for the line opening in 1869 and is consistent with 12 or so other structures on the Blue Mountains line. The cottage is still extant and is privately owned, but the land is owned by Transport Asset Holding Entity. A skillion roofed, weatherboard clad signal box was erected at the station in 1919, and the Western line was electrified as far as Bowenfels in 1958. The signal box and a small barrel roofed outbuilding have since been removed. The station remained in use until 1974 when passenger services ceased and the sidings to the Zig Zag were removed shortly after in 1975. During its years of use there were few major alterations to the building, though some original walls were penetrated to provide for internal access to rooms throughout the building that were otherwise only accessible through external entry ways. At some stage the fireplace in the parcels office section of the building has had its surround removed and the resulting hole blocked, apparently for the insertion of a stove flue, and there were modifications made to the toilets. The platform has been bitumen sealed, and the fencing replaced apart from a small section of rail timber picket fencing. Works were undertaken at the station in 1994 to accommodate the Lithgow Visitors' Information Centre. This has included the replacement of the floor (due to water damage), a new slate roof, restoration to the sandstone chimneys, painting and repointing. The building is unoccupied in 2009.  Description  The complex comprises the following buildings and structures: *Station building - type 3, stone, second class station building, erected 1869 *Residences: ** Station Master's, type 1, stone, erected 1869 ** Gatekeeper's, type 1, stone, erected 1869 - privately owned but on Transport Asset Holding Entity land *Platform - stone faced, erected 1869. Station building, erected 1869 Exterior: A stone, second class station building in rectangular symmetrical form. The Bowenfels Station building is constructed of coursed, random stone. Quoins are emphasised by large blocks of stone and reveals are stuccoed, while there are smooth cornice and eave mouldings. The central section of the station building is flanked at either end by wings with parapets concealing low pitched corrugated iron roofs behind. The roof to the central section is hipped and clad with slate. Of four extant chimneys one retains its terracotta pot. A verandah to the central section has a low pitched iron roof supported on decorative timber posts with brackets. All joinery is timber framed including four panel doors and box frames of both single and double pane type windows. Interior: The former station building is now used by COC Limited for office purposes. The building retains original layout with majority of its finishes modified or altered. Most of the fireplaces and their timber surrounds, slate hearths and cast iron grates survive. The fireplace in the former parcels office has been blocked but the slate hearth remains visible. The overall features include plaster ceilings with no cornices, timber architraves and four-panel doors (some removed), parquetry flooring, and modern kitchen and toilet fittings. The former porter's and lamp room maintain original finishes with only a new floor addition and is used for storage. The corrugated metal ceiling is exposed. Station master's residence, erected 1869 Exterior: The former Station Master's Residence reflects the chief characteristics of Victorian Rustic Gothic style architecture, particularly the steeply pitched roof, prominent gables, elaborately traceried bargeboards, label moulds and textured masonry walling. The residence like the station building is also constructed of coursed, random stone and has an asymmetrical façade. The slate roof is steeply pitched with two round stone chimneys (in group of two) with corbelled tops and prominent gables. One gable has a cross shaped vent and another has a date plaque. A veranda over the entrance has an iron roof and is supported on timber posts with decorative brackets and stone floor. Windows, which are boarded, feature smooth dressed reveals and label moulds above. Interior: The interior layout of the residence is generally discernable and remains in its original form, however, all internal finishes have been substantially modified or removed. Original elements include timber window and door architraves, moulded timber skirtings and stone chimney breasts with inappropriate pointing. All fireplace surrounds and doors have been removed or replaced. Floor finishes are generally carpet and tile flooring. There are no surviving original light or toilet/kitchen fittings. Gate keeper's residence, erected 1869 Exterior: The land of the Gatekeeper's residence is owned by the Transport Asset Holding Entity however; the residence is owned by a private entity. The residence is a simple version of the Station Master's residence featuring the characteristics of Victorian Gothic Revival style architecture. Constructed of coursed, random stone, it features a cross floor plan with steeply pitched corrugated metal roof. Windows are narrow and tall double-hung with two-pane sashes. A skillion roofed wing is located to the rear. Excluded from listing. Platform, erected 1869 A stone platform with stone face, concrete edge and bitumen sealed surface runs along the front of the former Station Building. Moveable items Station sign and remnant timber fence within the garden. Landscape features Gravel carpark and grassed garden with small trees and shrubs. The site essentially benefits from the surrounding properties' landscaping. Potential archaeological features The site has high archaeological potential due to a number of remnant items scattered within the garden in particular around the former station sign including a raised platform and remnant sidings.  Condition  The station building is generally in very good condition with the exception of a store room at the Lithgow end of the Platform, which is in poor condition internally. The station master's residence is generally in moderate condition. The gate keeper's residence is generally in moderate condition. The buildings are intact externally and relatively intact internally. Overall integrity of the building group is high.

Some changes to western end of building for change of use to tourist office.  Heritage listing  As at 18 October 2010, Bowenfels station and residence is of state significance as the earliest railway station beyond the Blue Mountains and remaining in use with minimal alteration for 105 years. The quality of the stonework and Victorian Rustic Gothic design of the buildings are of aesthetic significance. It is one of the best surviving stone station groups with intact early buildings that represent the first major phase of railway construction over the Blue Mountains during the 1860s and 1870s. The Station Master's residence is an unusual railway structure exhibiting excellent design as does the station building with intact slate roofs and original detailing. Bowenfels railway station is of historical significance for its role in the development of the Bowenfels area paving the way for the exploitation of local coal reserves, which lead to the development of Lithgow as a mining and industrial centre. Bowenfels railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Bowenfels Station and Residence over the Blue Mountains is of historical significance as part of the first major period of NSW railway construction that played a significant role in the development of the Bowenfels area paving the way for the exploitation of local coal reserves, which lead to the development of Lithgow as a mining and industrial centre. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The station and residence are of aesthetic significance with its fine stonework and Victorian Gothic Rustic elements contributing to the historic character of the area. The design of the Station Master's residence is unusual, and although accords with the standard practice that was in vouge in the 1860s, the use of stone was indicative of the Bowenfels Station's importance at the time of its construction.

The group has research potential as part of the Great Western Railway including the Great Zig Zag demonstrating early technical and architectural qualities. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Bowenfels Station and Residence is one of approximately 13 surviving railway groups from the earliest railway construction period (1850–1860s) in NSW. The buildings are rare due to their construction of stone, which indicates the importance of Bowenfels Station at the time of its construction. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.

It debuted on May 9, 2007, directly following the conclusion of the last issue of 52. The series is written primarily by Paul Dini, along with a rotating team of writers and artists. Countdown consists of 51 issues, number in reverse, published weekly for one year, crossing over with noteworthy and significant titles published by DC. The series covers much of the fictional DC Universe, told in parallel narratives, through the interconnecting stories of a cast of characters, and frequently crosses over with various other DC titles. Unlike the 52 limited series of the previous year, Countdown is not depicted as taking place in \\"real time\\" but presumably operates on the same floating timeline as DC Comics stories in general. Production history The series follows the success of 52, which, in contrast, did not cross over with DC's other regular titles. 52 concluded with the revelation that the Multiverse (a storytelling device which posits the existence of alternative realities) exists, and which now serves as a backdrop to several stories in Countdown. Beginning with issue #26, the series trade dress was reworked to identify the series as Countdown to Final Crisis.Newsarama.com: SDCC '07: DC's 'COUNTDOWN...TO THE END?' PANEL The stories taking place in Countdown set the stage for the approaching Final Crisis limited series. Countdown to Final Crisis was originally intended to run from issues #51-0, with issue 0 serving as the prologue to the Final Crisis limited series. Instead, it was decided that Countdown would conclude with issue #1 and the #0 issue was retitled to DC Universe #0. DC Universe #0 was co-written by Grant Morrison and Geoff Johns and served as a summary of recent events within the DC Universe in order to attract new readers before the company launched the Final Crisis limited series. While the book was billed as leading up to the beginning of DC's Final Crisis limited series, it later emerged that the plotlines in Countdown had diverged from what was written for Final Crisis, leading to continuity problems between the two books, as noted by Final Crisis author Grant Morrison. Much of the comic has subsequently been retconned out of continuity, along with Death of the New Gods. Jimmy Olsen learning Superman's identity, the battle between him and Darkseid, and other such events have been ignored following the conclusion of the series. During a DC Nation panel at the 2008 San Diego Comic Con, DC Editor-in-Chief Dan DiDio invited fans to give their own opinions on \\"what went wrong\\" with Countdown. DiDio had reportedly described the series (prior to its release) as \\"52 done right.\\" Story=Darkseid On Apokolips, Darkseid and Desaad discuss the coming of a time with existence being recreated with Darkseid as the architect. Darkseid has what appears to be a chess-board with pieces representing the Joker, Donna Troy, Green Arrow, the Flash, Holly Robinson, Batman, Jason Todd, Hawkman, Killer Croc, Martian Manhunter, Superman, Wonder Woman, OMAC, Jimmy Olsen, Nightwing, Duela Dent, and Black Adam. Later, as the New Gods Lightray and Sleez are killed by an unknown, mysterious figure, Darkseid converses with a concubine and Desaad. When the concubine comments on Darkseid showing a moment of weakness, Darkseid kills her and tells Desaad to remove the vocal cords from the next concubine. The conversation is witnessed by Forager of New Genesis, who is spying on them to see if Darkseid is responsible for the recent murders of the New Gods. Forager is attacked by a guard and escapes. The Deep Six are killed soon afterwards by the same mysterious figure. Darkseid shows knowledge of the New Gods dying across the galaxy and the mystery figure killing them, and decides to use the New Gods as pawns in a complex scheme intended to result in his rule of the entire Multiverse. Mary Marvel is brought before Darkseid, who tells her that he wants a sorcerer and that she is it. When she refuses his offer, they briefly fight before Desaad arrives and distracts Darkseid long enough for Mary to escape. Eclipso assures Darkseid that she will bring Mary back. Darkseid later restores Mary's powers and orders her to capture Jimmy Olsen. Later, Darkseid is about to siphon Jimmy's superpowers out of him before his son Orion emerges from a boom tube and apparently kills him after ripping his heart out. The Monitor Solomon places a chess piece of Darkseid onto the Source Wall as a memento of his victory. Donna Troy, Jason Todd, Kyle Rayner, and Ray Palmer In New York City, former Robin Jason Todd (now calling himself the \\"Red Hood\\") witnesses the murder of Duela Dent at the hands of a rogue Monitor, who claims her presence in this world is not tolerated as she is from an alternate Earth. Jason later meets former Wonder Girl Donna Troy after the other Teen Titans pay their respects at Duela's grave and speculates that the two of them, like Duela, may not belong in this reality either. During the Amazons' attack on Washington, D.C., Jason and Donna discuss the Monitors and the original Monitor and Anti-Monitor when they are attacked by the \\"Forerunner\\" who had been sent by the Monitors. Another Monitor arrives to save Jason and Donna from the Forerunners and takes them to safety. At the funeral of the Flash, Bart Allen, the Monitor tells Jason and Donna that the former Atom, Ray Palmer, is alive and lost somewhere in the Nanoverse, and that locating him is key to surviving the coming crisis. Donna, Jason and the Monitor (nicknamed \\"Bob\\" by Jason), meet with current Atom Ryan Choi in Ivy Town to recruit him in the search for Ray Palmer. Searching for him within the microscopic \\"Nanoverse\\", they are captured by Queen Belthera, and are later rescued by Kyle Rayner before Ryan Choi is abducted back into Ivy Town. Kyle informs the group that they will have to tour the Multiverse to find Ray Palmer, and they encounter the Authority on Earth-50, a Soviet Superman on Earth-30, and the Crime Society on Earth-3. As they leave Earth-3, they are unexpectedly joined by the Jokester (the Joker's heroic counterpart and father of Duela), passing through Earth-15 and later Earth-8, where Lord Havok and the Extremists capture them before an invasion by Monarch and his newest recruits, the Crime Society gives Jason the opportunity to feign a betrayal, allowing their eventual escape. Arriving on Earth-12, a universe resembling the Batman Beyond television series, another Monitor who has named himself Nix Uotan arrives, and informs Bob that all the Monitors have taken on names for themselves, such as the Monitor of Earth-8, who now calls himself Solomon. By stating that Ray Palmer lives \\"a life of no consequence\\", he unintentionally reveals the location of Ray Palmer and Bob reasons that the only way Nix Uotan could know what Ray is doing is if he was on his Earth. The group then arrive on Earth-51, a near-perfect world where super-crime has long been eradicated. They locate Ray, living the life of his deceased counterpart. Bob is revealed to have been working for Solomon's cause and tells Ray that he must be exterminated. The Challengers attempt to stop Bob, who succeeds in killing the alternate versions of Barry Allen, Ralph Dibny and Jean Loring, but Ray and the Challengers escape. After Monarch descends upon Earth-51, with his Crime Society and Extremists recruits, Kyle and Ray are confronted by Power Ring and alternate versions of Booster Gold and Supergirl, whilst elsewhere Donna faces an alternate version of herself as Jason fights with Gorgon of Earth-8. Jason is accosted by the Batman of Earth-51, who had eradicated the super-villains of his world following his Jason's murder (as Jason wished that his Batman would have done). Eventually warming to Jason, he gives him a new costume, one that his world's Jason never got the chance to wear, and Jason assumes the mantle of \\"Red Robin\\". Meanwhile, Queen Belthera also arrives on Earth-51 and sends her insect armies into the fight, which includes the evil alternate Donna. After \\"Dark Donna\\" is defeated, New Earth's Donna is able to masquerade as her to get close to Belthera, kill her and assume leadership of Belthera's troops by right of conquest. Ray and Kyle are also able to deal with their opponents and Ray explains why his counterpart on Earth-51 was so important: Earth-51's Ray discovered a sentient virus named Morticoccus and had it quarantined. However, when the Multiverse was discovered, Ray theorized that Morticoccus could exist on other Earths and set about using his own superhuman immune system to immunize their populations. After the death of Earth-51's Ray Palmer, the New Earth Ray Palmer found his research and continued his work, leaving an atom symbol on those who he had immunized. Kyle, Jason, Donna, Ray and the Batman of Earth-51 are reunited as they approach their confrontation with Monarch but encounter a message written in large flaming letters: To Apokolips. Before they decide their next move, the Earth-51 Batman confronts a group of Monarch's soldiers led by the Joker only to be killed by Ultraman. As Jason stops to mourn the loss of the alternate Batman, he finds the Joker laughing amongst the rubble and kills him. The Challengers are then met by Nix Uotan, who explains that the message came from The Source and sends them to Apokolips. On Apokolips, the Challengers are confused as to why they are there as Palmer says it is not connected to the Great Disaster. Jason tires of their bickering and leaves. Upon seeing Brother Eye, Jason contemplates using it to get back home. While searching for Jason, the Challengers find Mary, Harley, Holly and then Karate Kid, just after Brother Eye removes the Morticoccus virus from him. The group, along with Jason, prepares to confront Brother Eye, who uses a Boom Tube to send them to Apokolips' surface. The group is caught in the shockwave of Apokolips' destruction just as they are about to be attacked by an army of OMACs. The Challengers, Ray Palmer, Firestorm, Una, Harley, Holly, and Mary Marvel attempt to figure out what to do about Karate Kid, who is dying from the virus. Solomon, the Monitor of Earth-8, arrives and sends everyone back to Earth. Jason leaves the group upon their arrival. Soon after, the group discovers that no one recognizes them, and that their homes and headquarters are not there. The group goes to see Dubbilex for help with Karate Kid, only to learn that he has already died. When Karate Kid's autopsy is performed, Morticoccus is accidentally released, grows and attacks the Challengers. The virus is captured by Rayner and explodes. However, it is discovered that the virus began spreading across the planet before the autopsy, causing infected humans to devolve into animalistic savages and infected animals to gain human-like traits. Una helps Buddy Blank reach his daughter's apartment and the two locate Buddy's daughter, who has been infected by the virus, and his grandson, who is immune. Una dies while protecting Buddy and his grandson from a swarm of rats, and gives Buddy her Legion Flight Ring, which he uses to take him and his grandson to Cadmus's Command D facility. The Challengers leave the reconstituted Earth-51 and return home. After witnessing Darkseid's death, Jason returns to being a solo anti-hero while Donna, Kyle, Ray Palmer and Forager, along with the Monitor Nix Uotan, reform the Challengers and watch over the other Monitors. Mary Marvel, Holly Robinson, and Harley Quinn Mary Batson awakens from a coma after the events of The Trials of Shazam! in which she lost her abilities mid- flight due to the death of Shazam, and fell three miles. She seeks Freddy Freeman, who paid her hospital bills, and consults Madame Xanadu, who fails to locate Freddy and warns Mary not to go to Gotham City. Ignoring her, Mary is chased by thugs through the Gotham subway, and finds the former Kahndaqi Embassy, where Black Adam has been hiding. Adam appears, saves Mary, and, following a discussion, transfers his powers to Mary. Mary acquires the powers of Black Adam, Isis, and Osiris as a result. Soon after getting these powers, she battles a demon composed of stillborns. Mary eventually locates Billy, who explains that he has replaced the wizard Shazam and that Freddy will replace him. Billy scolds Mary for taking Black Adam's powers and Mary protests that she will use them for good. In Gotham City, Mary encounters former super- villain the Riddler at a crime scene. Mary stops Clayface with excessive violence. Riddler suggests she seek a mentor while Eclipso watches with interest. Mary seeks out Zatanna, who senses a new darkness in Mary. Zatanna brings Mary to her home, Shadowcrest, where she trains her. Mary suffers a sudden mood swing and challenges Zatanna to battle, wielding one of her magic rods. Eclipso observes as Zatanna turns Mary's own lightning against her and banishes her from Shadowcrest. In the Chinese Market, Mary meets Klarion the Witch Boy, who tries to get some of her power. After Eclipso attempts to corrupt Mary, the Shadowpact take notice of Mary's activities, and attack Mary and Eclipso, who are overwhelmed and escape. Eclipso takes Mary to meet Darkseid, who offers to show her true darkness. Upon observing his treatment of people as mere puppets, Mary attacks him. An interruption by Desaad allows Mary to escape. Eclipso talks Mary into returning to Darkseid and submitting to his authority, suggesting that she can usurp his powers if she grows strong enough. The asteroid on which Mary and Eclipso are standing is destroyed by a stray shot from the Dominators and Monarch's armies. After Eclipso teleports her to safety, Mary blasts Eclipso with her own black diamond after realizing that Eclipso was only interested in selling her to Darkseid as a concubine in exchange for power. Eclipso manages to wrest the diamond from Mary's grasp, and leaves, telling her that she is once again alone. Eclipso then attempts to kill Mary, but finds that she is too strong. During their battle, Mary calls down the lightning, which strikes the two of them, causing Mary to fall into the ocean and wash up on the shores of Themiscyra. Holly Robinson arrives in Metropolis, hoping to embark on a fresh start. Holly is offered a place to live at a women's shelter, where she meets the reformed Harleen Quinzel. She is outraged to find that the refuge refuses shelter to a single mother and speaks to their leader, Athena, who convinces Holly to go on a quest. Holly reveals to Harleen that she has been asked to take part in Athena's self- esteem workshop; Harleen is overjoyed at the news. Holly is subjected to a purification ritual in which the women are made to fight one another. Holly and Harley are the only warriors left standing. The two are taken to Themiscyra, and told by Athena that their first test is to out-swim the island's water guardians. The recruits are led through a series of increasingly dangerous obstacles. Holly and Harley explore a cave outside the confines of the training ground, and discover the cave is being used as a hideout by Hippolyta, who reveals to the two of them that Athena is a fake, and advises them to play along until the truth can be uncovered. Holly and Harley take Mary Marvel to Hippolyta, who detects that Mary is powerless and that darkness was inside of her. After explaining the situation to her, the three ask for Mary's help. Mary poses as a slave to spy. The group reveals Granny's identity to the trainees, and after Hippolyta wounds her, she flees to Apokolips, with Mary, Holly, and Harley in pursuit. On Apokolips, Mary, Holly and Harley fight Lashina, Stompa and Mad Harriet of the Female Furies. Lashina and Stompa are defeated while Mad Harriet is accidentally killed by Apokoliptian soldiers. While formulating an escape plan, Mary says she hears the Greek gods. The group manage to free the Greek gods from an Apokoliptian chamber, and Mary regains her powers and previous costume, now with a gray lightning bolt, after saying the magic word \\"Shazam\\". At the same time the goddesses Thalia, Muse of Comedy, and Diana, Goddess of the Hunt, grant powers to Harley Quinn and Holly Robinson, respectively. The now empowered group pursue Granny Goodness, who is killed by the God-Killer before their eyes. After returning to their own Earth, Holly and Harley return to Gotham, while Mary returns to her apartment and finds Darkseid waiting for her. Darkseid offers to return Black Adam's powers to her in exchange for bringing him Jimmy Olsen. Mary agrees, and with her restored powers she quickly overcomes the Challengers and captures Jimmy. When the Challengers and the Justice League come to save Jimmy, Mary takes out most of them single-handedly. After the death of Darkseid, Harley and Holly return to Gotham and share an apartment while Mary tracks down Black Adam, hoping to become part of a new Black Marvel Family. Black Adam rejects her and leaves, and Mary declares that she does not need anyone. Jimmy Olsen Jimmy Olsen as Mr. Action Jimmy Olsen locates the Red Hood, Jason Todd, and interviews him about the death of Duela Dent. Jason suggests that he interviews the Joker in Arkham Asylum. The Joker states that he never had a daughter, and alludes to a larger conspiracy. While calling Lois to inform her of his dead end, Jimmy is attacked by Killer Croc. To Jimmy's surprise, his body stretches, similar to Plastic Man and the Elongated Man, meaning Killer Croc cannot penetrate his skin. Jimmy displays other powers, such as super-speed. He also has the ability to project spines from his body, but the powers manifest themselves at irregular intervals. Jimmy witnesses the death of the New God Lightray, and dreams of being trapped in the Source Wall. He meets a former minion of Darkseid named Sleez, who is killed before he can reveal anything, although he hears the words \\"So begins the end.\\" Jimmy resolves to use his new powers to become a superhero and designs a costume and calls himself Mr. Action. He revels in his new popularity, and decides to join the Teen Titans. Titans’ leader Robin begs him to reconsider, as his powers only manifest when he is in danger. Jimmy confronts Clark Kent and reveals he knows Clark is Superman: he pulls away Clark's shirt to reveal Superman's costume. Jimmy tries out for membership in the Justice League, but is deflated when his powers do not manifest. John Henry Irons tests Jimmy's powers using metahuman biofeedback, but the display generates complicated images of the Source Wall and alternate Earths. On his way home, Jimmy meets two members of Cadmus, who offer their assistance, take him back to their HQ, and run tests on him. Jimmy's powers go haywire, and he runs off to keep himself from hurting anyone. He encounters the Newsboy Legion, who offer him shelter. Jimmy encounters Forager, who asks for help in stopping the killing of the New Gods. On Apokolips, Jimmy and Forager fight Parademons and are overpowered and taken prisoner. The Monitors decide that Jimmy is not meant to control his powers and that he is being manipulated. Jimmy is sent to the slave pits, where his overseers are ordered to torture him; Mister Miracle comes to his aid. Unable to discern the nature of Jimmy's powers with his Mother Box, Mister Miracle gambles by dropping Olsen into a fire pit. Jimmy survives by assuming a turtle-like form. Jimmy locates Forager, who then attacks him. Jimmy duplicates the powers of a Mother Box to restore Forager's sanity. When the two of them are confronted by Bernadeth, Jimmy manages to open a Boom Tube and returns to Earth with Forager, whereupon he kisses her. Back at Jimmy's apartment, Forager reveals to Jimmy that he is a soul catcher, who is collecting the spirits of the deceased New Gods. Jimmy later sees the words \\"To Apokolips\\" daubed on his bathroom cabinet. Before going to Apokolips, Jimmy decides to go and seek the aid of the \\"Hairies\\" of the Habitat. Jimmy travels to Apokolips and decides to confront Darkseid to determine his involvement with what is going on with his manifesting powers. Solomon tells him that he had been turned into a spirit collector by Darkseid, who plans to drain him of all his powers when the time comes. He is then sent back to Earth along with everyone else. Jimmy is later captured by Mary Marvel, who intends to deliver him to Darkseid. Darkseid turns Jimmy's powers off and prepares to absorb them, but is attacked by Superman. As they battle, Mary Marvel fights and defeats Donna, Kyle, Forager, Black Canary, and Vixen. Darkseid reactivates Jimmy's powers to cause him to emit kryptonite radiation to kill Superman. However, Ray Palmer sneaks inside Jimmy and destroys the circuitry that controls his powers before being overcome by its defenses. Jimmy transforms into a scaled giant and prepares to fight Darkseid. Darkseid fights Jimmy across Metropolis and is about to kill him when Ray Palmer emerges from Jimmy's head, having shut down the device inside Jimmy that was storing the essences of the New Gods. A Boom Tube then opens up and Orion, Darkseid's son, emerges. Orion clashes with Darkseid and kills him after ripping Darkseid's heart from his chest. Soon afterwards Jimmy returns home, where his relationship with Forager deteriorates. Karate Kid and Triplicate Girl Karate Kid (Val Armorr) fights Batman in the Batcave and is eventually subdued by Black Lightning. He is briefly held by the League, and when he is released is joined by Legion member Triplicate Girl, who now calls herself \\"Una\\". Karate Kid and Una travel to the Oracle's home, where they discover that someone is trying to steal the secret identities of all of the world's superheroes, which Oracle manages to prevent. Oracle learns that the Calculator is behind the plot and defeats him. Karate Kid reveals that he is dying from a virus and only Oracle can help him. After examining Karate Kid, Oracle determines that the virus is either of alien origin, or too advanced to detect. She directs the two to see Elias Orr for more answers. After they have defeated Orr's bodyguard, Equus, Elias directs them to another researcher; he deduces it may be related to the OMAC virus. After the two leave, Orr reports dutifully to Desaad. Karate Kid and Una meet Professor Buddy Blank, who takes them to see Brother Eye, who is imprisoned within a NORAD storage hangar. Brother Eye confirms that Val is infected with the OMAC virus and refers to the \\"Great Disaster\\". He informs Val that there is a similar strain hidden in a bunker beneath Blüdhaven. Traveling through the ruins of Blüdhaven, the group meet Firestorm as Val begins to cough up blood. Sensing something beneath the surface, Val directs Firestorm to blast a hole to the cavern below. Karate Kid and Firestorm take on the Atomic Knights and break into a vault under Blüdhaven to find Professor Stein being tortured by Desaad. Desaad steals Firestorm's powers and attacks Val and Una. The Atomic Knights arrive and, deploying a device on Desaad, separate Firestorm from Desaad, who then escapes to Apokolips. The Atomic Knights turn their attention to Karate Kid and the others, but are unable to act before Jason and Gehenna re-merge into Firestorm and overpower them. Buddy Blank leads Val, Una, and his grandson deeper underground. Coming upon a sealed door, Karate Kid attempts to open it, which enables Brother Eye to escape the NORAD storage hangar. Converting the people in the hangar into OMACs, Brother Eye assimilates the entire base and breaks free. Upon detecting that the Morticoccus host is in its final gestation, and that the virus' release is imminent, it sets course for Blüdhaven, declaring: \\"Eye am the Shepherd, Eye am the way\\". Brother Eye shields itself from detection and assimilates the remains of Blüdhaven, converting it into its new base. Using Firestorm and the Atomic Knights as power sources, Brother Eye continues to grow. Val, Una, Buddy, and his grandson survive underground, with Val theorizing that they are beneath its notice. Upon discovering Apokoliptian technology in the bunker, Brother Eye opens a Boom Tube and takes its captives to Apokolips, leaving Professor Blank and his grandson behind. After arriving on Apokolips, Darkseid's Parademons engage the OMACs, who begin to assimilate them. Val and Una wander around Apokolips seeking a means to escape as Val fears Brother Eye desires the virus he carries. However, before they can formulate a plan, Una becomes an OMAC. However, Val is mysteriously able to resist assimilation by Brother Eye, who decides to kill him instead. Jason Todd saves him and suggests killing Una as assimilation is apparently irreversible. Val protests this idea and Todd leaves. Brother Eye tries a second assimilation attempt and fails. Instead, it decides to take Val away and perform an autopsy. Brother Eye then removes the Morticoccus virus from Val, who is then saved by Ray Palmer. Apokolips' destruction and Brother Eye's escape free Una from her transformation into an OMAC. When Solomon sends the Challengers to a recreated Earth-51, Val dies and releases the Morticoccus virus, which infects the entire world. Meanwhile, the Brother Eye of Earth-51 transforms Professor Blank into a modified OMAC with limited free will, enabling him and his grandson Tommy to escape the ruins of Command-D, effectively birthing a new version of Earth A.D. from the original Kamandi series. Trickster and Piper The Rogues are reconstituted with a new membership of Heat Wave, Mirror Master, Captain Cold, Abra Kadabra, Weather Wizard, Trickster and Pied Piper, led by Inertia. Several Rogues distrust Trickster and Piper as they have reformed in the past. The Rogues plan to and eventually succeed in, killing the Flash, Bart Allen. Piper and Trickster then go on the run following Bart's murder, but attend his funeral, where they are captured by Multiplex and Deadshot. Eventually escaping, they are later pursued in Gotham City by the Suicide Squad (composed of Deadshot, Bronze Tiger, Plastique and Captain Boomerang, Jr.) and later Oracle's dispatches: the Question and Batwoman, villainous duo Poison Ivy and Deathstroke, and eventually Batman and Wally West himself, on his vendetta against the Rogues who he believes killed his cousin Bart. Piper and Trickster attempt to tell Wally that they overheard Deathstroke's plans to murder the attendees at Black Canary and Green Arrow's wedding, but are internally attacked by Deathstroke's tracking device. Flash manages to remove the explosive implants and brings the two of them to Zatanna's home. Flash confiscates the duo's weapons. However, Trickster and Piper use Zatanna's mummy bodyguard Hassan to create a distraction and escape Black Canary's bachelorette party. They then find himself in the middle of a battle on the wedding day and manage to use the Joker's exploding \\"present\\" against Poison Ivy, gaining some measure of revenge over her. As they escape in a stolen car, they are suddenly accosted by Double Down, who had hidden in the back seat. Double Down wants to join the two in their run from the law, mentioning the disappearances of several villains. The group is then attacked by the Suicide Squad. Double Down is defeated and captured, but Piper and Trickster, using Trickster's cloaking field, evade the squad and decide to follow them and free the other villains they have captured. They follow them to a government facility, and manage to free Two-Face. Two-Face tells them that Checkmate is behind the abductions. After flipping his coin, Two-Face declines to join the two. Piper and Trickster continue to flee, escaping capture by Deadshot. They are able to defeat Deadshot, but not before he manages to shoot the Trickster dead. The cord attaching them together detects that Trickster is dead and begins a fail-safe procedure, counting down from twenty-four hours until it detonates. Piper uses his flute to slow the countdown. The train they are on stops for a routine check, causing Piper to flee into the desert. Piper, delirious from the heat, begins to imagine Trickster's corpse is talking to him and removes Trickster's hand from his body to avoid triggering the bomb. Piper goes through a Boom Tube to Apokolips that opens in front of him after thinking he's seeing the \\"light at the end of the tunnel\\". Once on Apokolips, Piper begins to despair, thinking he is in Hell, and contemplates pulling Trickster's hand out of its cuff and killing himself. Piper is stopped by an unknown person before he sets off the bomb. The person reveals himself to be Desaad, who frees Piper from the cord, which is revealed to be based on his technology. Desaad claims Piper is able to channel the Anti-Life Equation in a manner beyond that of a New God. However, before Piper can play the equation on his pipe, Brother Eye finishes assimilating Apokolips. After recovering, Desaad confesses to masterminding Trickster and Piper's ordeal. However, they are attacked by an OMAC and Piper is captured. Desaad continues to pursue Piper and convinces him to finally play. Piper uses his pipe to kill Desaad and destroy Apokolips (the latter by playing Queen's \\"The Show Must Go On\\", knowing it would be the last he would perform), causing Brother Eye to escape when Apokolips explodes. Piper reawakens in Gotham City and decides to become a hero after seeing the Bat-Signal. Monarch, the Monitors, and Superman- Prime After Duela Dent's murder, one of the Monitors consults the Source Wall to learn the cause of the rising tension in the Multiverse. The Wall reveals that the \\"Great Disaster\\" is the cause of the rising tension and that Ray Palmer is the solution to stopping it. At their headquarters, the Monitors discuss their goal of protecting the Multiverse from individuals who cross between worlds. They vote to decide the fates of Donna Troy, Jason Todd, and Kyle Rayner, and the decision is made to purge them as anomalies. The Monitors dispatch a Forerunner named Viza Aziv to kill Jason Todd and Donna Troy. After beating Jason, Forerunner fights Donna. The encounter is interrupted by one of the Monitors. Created by the Monitors, Forerunner cannot harm them. Having failed in her mission, Forerunner goes into self-imposed exile. Monarch (Nathaniel Adam) witnesses the defeat of the Forerunner. Monarch takes the Forerunner to the Bleed, and recruits her into his army after revealing to her that her people on Earth-34 have been exterminated by Dark Angel at the Monitors' behest.Countdown to Adventure #3 (Oct. 2007)Countdown #43 (July 2007) Monarch and Forerunner approach the Justice League Axis of Earth-10, the Crime Society of Earth-3, and the Extremists of Earth-8 and offers them membership in his army. The Extremists refuse and attack him, but he easily overwhelms them, and captures the \\"Challengers from Beyond\\". The Monitors believe Monarch's goal is to cause a war across the Multiverse, resulting in another Crisis that would make him the absolute Monarch of a singular reality. Monarch places Lord Havok in charge of his starfleet; Havok deals a crippling blows to the Dominators of New Earth. The Monitors agree to eliminate \\"Bob,\\" the Monitor of New Earth who befriended Jason and Donna. Earth-15's Monitor watches as Donna and Jason leave his Earth, and predicts that when they arrive on the Earth of his overzealous brother, they will be terminated. The overzealous Monitor, who oversees Earth-8, attacks them when they arrive on Earth-8, but succeeds only in killing the Jokester of Earth-3. The Monitor from Earth-8 rallies the others to his cause, listing the threats of Monarch's armies, the deaths of the New Gods, the manipulation of Jimmy Olsen, the virus infecting Karate Kid, and the possibility that a single individual is behind it all as evidence. With the help of a female Monitor named Doctrine, he convinces the others that they must go to war in order to save billions of lives that would otherwise be lost. The Monitors arrive on Earth-51, shortly after the Challengers escape. The Monitor of Earth-8, now calling himself \\"Solomon\\", attempts to absorb Bob into his being, but inadvertently kills him instead. The other Monitors, shocked, then voice their suspicions that Solomon engineered all of the events to his own ends. The Monitors are then interrupted by the arrival of Monarch and his army. As the two sides fight, Monarch approaches Solomon and accuses him of desiring sole dominion over the Multiverse. Solomon returns to the Multiversal nexus where the remaining Monitors condemn his actions before joining the battle on Earth-51. Floating in space, Nix Uotan, the Monitor of Earth-51, watches the battle raging on his Earth before joining the other Monitors. Feeling a call from the Source, he directs Donna, Jason, Kyle, and Ray to Apokolips, and remains behind on Earth-51 to finish his duty. Superman-Prime, surviving The Sinestro Corps War and now appearing as an adult wearing a black and silver variation of Superman's costume (like the one Superman himself wore when he was resurrected), continues his travels throughout the Multiverse in order to find the perfect universe. Superman-Prime attacks the Lex Luthor of Earth-15, while searching for his perfect universe, which he believes is owed to him. He brings Lex to that Earth's Fortress of Solitude, and kills that world's Superman (Zod) and his pregnant wife and then flies through the Justice League Satellite, killing Luthor and the Justice League members inside the satellite. Expressing his disgust over the League lacking the roster he desires, he returns to Earth and kills the Earth-15 Wonder Woman (Donna) and Batman (Jason). Realizing this is not the perfect Earth he is looking for, Superman- Prime dives through the planet and destroys it. He vows to find his perfect universe even if he has to tear apart the entire Multiverse to do so. Building a secret lair in the Source Wall itself, Superman-Prime captures Mister Mxyzptlk and Annataz Arataz, an evil analogue of Zatanna, and forces them to give him their magic powers as a replacement for the energies he temporarily absorbed from a Guardian. After her torture at Superman-Prime's hands, Annataz experiences a change of heart and, as a way to atone for her past, taunts Superman-Prime until he lets Mxyzptlk escape, facing his tantrums alone. Superman-Prime destroys his base, burns Annataz alive, and flees. Mxyzptlk orders Gsptlsnz, his girlfriend, to seal off the Fifth Dimension. Superman- Prime later travels to the Multiversal nexus where he finds Solomon and demands his aid. Forerunner arrives as Superman-Prime threatens to kill Solomon unless he shows him his perfect universe; Solomon then shows Superman- Prime the war transpiring on Earth-51. Superman-Prime then flies down to Earth-51 and smashes into Monarch's command center. After fighting for a while, Monarch mocks Superman-Prime as a child, causing Superman-Prime to tear a hole in Monarch's containment suit, which sets of a chain reaction that destroys Earth-51 and the surrounding universe. Nix Uotan, the Monitor of Earth-51 and sole survivor of the cataclysm, cries as he finds a sapling emerging from scorched ground. In the Multiversal nexus, Solomon prepares to kill Forerunner, but is interrupted by the arrival of Darkseid, who, wishing to continue their game, offers Solomon the next move. As they witness Brother Eye assimilating Apokolips, Solomon tells Darkseid that his time is coming to an end. Darkseid reveals that Solomon was responsible for Captain Atom irradiating Blüdhaven, causing his transformation into Monarch. Solomon, disturbed by Darkseid's plans to control the \\"Fifth World\\", appears to the Challengers, telling them that Darkseid is too dangerous to attack and sends them away. He deposits them on Nix Uotan's newly recreated Earth-51, where the events of the Great Disaster Unfold. Solomon is later seen in the Multiversal nexus planning to stop Darkseid. Solomon later places a chess piece of Darkseid onto the Source Wall as a memento of his victory and then witnesses Donna Troy, Kyle Rayner, Ray Palmer, and Forager agreeing to act as watchmen for the Monitors at the urging of Nix Uotan, who is impressed by the Challengers selflessness and repulsed by his brethren's lack of foresight. Related events Since Countdown attempts to be the backbone to several DC Comics titles, some events and plots play out in different comic book series. Meanwhile, the Amazons invade Washington, D.C., led by a recently resurrected Hippolyta and Circe. The mini-series concluded with the revelation that the goddess Athena has in fact been defeated and replaced by the Apokoliptian New God Granny Goodness, suggesting that the shelter that Harley Quinn and Holly Robinson are staying in is actually a Female Furies camp. Tying into the Karate Kid storyline is the Justice League of America/Justice Society of America crossover \\"The Lightning Saga\\". The fight between Batman and Karate Kid is shown in both Countdown and Justice League of America. Dawnstar, Starman, Dream Girl, Timber Wolf, and Wildfire are discovered stranded in the 21st century. Initially, it is believed that they came to the present to save Lightning Lad. It is later revealed that the Legion actually came to retrieve a person, the identity of whom is yet unknown, whose \\"essence\\" is now stored in one of the Legion's \\"lightning rod\\" devices. The Legion then escaped into the future, leaving behind Starman and Karate Kid. An unforeseen consequence of the Legion's actions was the return of Wally West and his family. Brainiac 5 confirms this by implying West's return was a freak accident, but that they still retrieved the correct person the Legion sought. The final arc of The Flash: The Fastest Man Alive, \\"Full Throttle\\", features the Rogues successfully killing Bart Allen, the fourth Flash. Within Countdown, both the buildup to this as well as its aftermath is felt. Bart's funeral is held and Piper and Trickster are forced on the run from superheroes and villains alike, which also ties into the upcoming Salvation Run. Connecting this story to \\"The Lightning Saga\\" is Wally's return to Earth. Wally's new vendetta against the Rogues is witnessed in Countdown where he finally catches up to Piper and Trickster, the remaining Rogues having already been captured in All Flash #1. Salvation Run, by Bill Willingham, Lilah Sturges and Sean Chen, is the story of various supervillains who have been captured and deported via Boom Tube technology to another planet. Regarding Countdown, Newsarama asked writer Willingham \\"Just to try and point out an example of this in action, would it be safe to say that Pied Piper and Trickster would have found themselves on this world had they not escaped capture in Countdown?\\", to which the response was \\"That's a fairly safe guess.\\" The Suicide Squad, behind the attempted captures of Piper and Trickster were also shown to have captured other Rogues in All-Flash #1 who are pictured on the cover for issue #1. In Countdown, after escaping Suicide Squad member Deadshot, Piper and Trickster later evade capture from four other members in Gotham City. Among those captured in the limited series include Lex Luthor, Scandal Savage, and the Joker, and the title refers to the planned escape from the planet as led by Luthor. As well as playing a prominent part in Countdown, the story thread centering on the Death of the New Gods is playing out in other books. Outsiders: Five of a Kind: Week Three: Thunder/Martian Manhunter featured the deaths of New Gods Grayven and Speed Queen at the hands of a mysterious God-Killer, while the New God Knockout was killed in Birds of Prey #109. This appears to be leading into the Death of the New Gods limited series written and drawn by Jim Starlin, which saw the demise of all of the characters created by Jack Kirby for his \\"Fourth World\\" metaseries. After the conclusion of the Death of the New Gods limited series, DC editorial revealed that the \\"Fourth World\\" concept would be replaced by a \\"Fifth World\\" concept some time in the future. In Captain Carrot and the Final Ark (October 2007), written by Bill Morrison, with art by co- creator Scott Shaw, The Zoo Crew reunite in the midst of growing strife between the land and the sea creatures of Earth-26, sparked by Starro. Unfortunately, they encounter Starro and most of their powers are neutralized except for Pig Iron. Furthermore, that Earth is rendered uninhabitable and the Crew has an ocean liner loaded with refugees transported off the planet by the Just-A-Lot-Of-Animals. Unfortunately, the ship is accidentally sent to New Earth. Although the Justice League encounter the ship and land it safely, all the passengers, including The Crew are transformed into their animal forms indigenous to that Earth and, although they all apparently still have their human level intelligence, they are unable to speak. However, some time in the future, the Crew will discover that their powers have been restored. In Final Crisis #7, Captain Carrot is seen in the climactic battle with his humanity and powers restored, and Pig Iron is with him. Secondary titles Countdown: Arena was a four-part series featuring Monarch organizing a battle tournament between the heroes of the 52 universes, in order to determine who will be worthy of joining his army. Countdown to Adventure follows the adventures of Starfire, Animal Man and Adam Strange after their return home in 52. Starfire and Animal Man continue with life on Earth, although their powers are not entirely reliable despite ample time to readjust to Earth's environment, while Adam Strange is replaced as the guardian of the planet Rann by an ultra- violent Hollywood actor named Champ Hazard. Meanwhile, the return of Lady Styx is heralded on Earth and Rann by zombie-like outbursts of three words: \\"Believe in her.\\" Backup stories within Countdown to Adventure feature Forerunner and Monarch and expand upon both her origin story and her journey through the Multiverse, including an alternate history version of the Justice League had the Nazi's won World War 2 with the JLA being organized by Hitler. Countdown to Mystery features the adventures of Kent V. Nelson becoming Doctor Fate. In a backup story, Eclipso seduces the heroes of the DC Universe, tying into Countdown appearances with Mary Marvel and begins with the corruption of Plastic Man and Darkseid's revelation that he is Eclipso's true creator and that Eclipso's black diamond was mined on the planet Apokolips. The Countdown Presents: The Search for Ray Palmer one-shots expand on the Challengers' quest to find former Atom Ray Palmer. Countdown Presents: Lord Havok and the Extremists concerns events on Earth-8 and how they impact the future of the Multiverse and the Countdown to Final Crisis limited series.Forbidden Planet International: Lord Havok and the Extremists #6 Promotional campaign At the New York Comic Con in 2007, DC distributed four pins, with the option of a fifth, promoting storylines in Countdown. The first four pins say: \\"WWMMD?\\" (\\"What Would Mary Marvel Do?\\"), \\"I Found Ray Palmer\\", \\"Look to the Skies!\\" and \\"Jimmy Olsen Must Die!\\". The final pin says, \\"Darkseid Rules!\\" The first teaser image for Countdown, by Phil Jimenez. DC released image captioned: \\"Let the battle cry be heard in the land, a shout of great destruction...\\"Newsarama.com: Large Teaser Image A teaser poster was released, which shows Wonder Woman comforting Superman, Batman in a different costume (with a sword and what appears to be chain mail armor) and Donna Troy wearing her Wonder Girl costume again. Kyle Rayner is wearing a yellow ring, and Mary Marvel is shown partially in shadow. Mister Miracle stands next to Big Barda. Also notable among the poster is a Legion flight ring, a minuscule red hand (the Atom's) sticking out of the rubble, and the bodies of Blue Beetle (Ted Kord), Maxwell Lord, The Question (Vic Sage), and Jade — major or notable heroes who had recently died. The heroes are gathered around the head of the Statue of Liberty; the headless body of the statue can be seen in the background. While alternately revealing and retracting his statements about Jason Todd being the new Red Robin, Dan DiDio confirmed the latter within the pages of DC Comics as of July 2007. DiDio had also previously mentioned that Barry Allen would be the returning Flash. In later interviews, Dan DiDio finally explained the symbolism of the image in light of the fact that a second was soon to be released. Released with books published on July 5, 2007 in the DC Nation: #68 column, DiDio described the picture's symbolism: \\"Anyone standing on barren ground is doomed. In this case, it spells the Death of the New Gods...The yellow ring corrupts Kyle (Rayner) in The Sinestro Corps War...Jason Todd becomes Red Robin, driving a wedge in the Challengers from Beyond...Green Arrow struggles to win the love of Black Canary...Batman, in symbolic garb, wields the sword that hearkens the return of a deadly foe (Ra's al Ghul)...Dressed in Barry's costume, Bart (Allen, the Flash) showed that he had one foot in the grave...A Legionnaire is lost and marked for death in Countdown...The Atom, lost, struggles to survive...The shield marked Hippolyta's return...Superman and Wonder Woman discuss parent issues...Is that a Boom Tube I see, and can that be the path to salvation?...The shadow of evil falls over Mary Marvel...and the statue head, reminiscent of and tied to Kamandi #1, also reflects Sinestro's upcoming visit to the Big Apple.\\" The second teaser image for Countdown, by Ethan Van Sciver. A second teaser image was released by DC comics to the website Newsarama.com. Drawn by Ethan Van Sciver with the caption \\"...And Evil Shall Inherit The Earth\\".

This work was revised in 1950. It was composed four years after the Symphonies of Wind Instruments, which he wrote upon his arrival in Paris after his stay in Switzerland. These two compositions are from Stravinsky's neoclassical period, and represent a departure from the composer's previous Russian style, in which he produced works such as The Rite of Spring. This concerto numbers among many works for piano written about the same time to be played by the composer himself. This is also true of Capriccio for Piano and Orchestra (1929), his Sonata of 1924 and his Serenade in A (1925). He kept the performance rights to himself for a number of years, wanting the engagements for playing this work for himself, as well as urgently desiring to keep \\"incompetent or Romantic hands\\" from \\"interpreting\\" the piece before undiscriminating audiences.Michael Steinberg, The Concerto: A Listener's Guide (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 1998) (cloth) (pbk), 467. Orchestration The concerto, as described in its name, is scored for solo piano accompanied by an ensemble of wind instruments. The instrumentation of the wind section is what would be found in a standard symphony orchestra: two flutes, piccolo, two oboes, cor anglais, two clarinets, two bassoons (second bassoon doubling contrabassoon), four horns, four trumpets, three trombones, and tuba. The work also calls for double basses (divisi in 3) and a timpano. Although combining winds and piano was unusual at the time, the form had been explored earlier in the twentieth century and would be explored later. Première The concerto debuted under Serge Koussevitzky at the Opera of Paris on May 22, 1924 under the direction of the composer, who played the piano. Koussevitzky had requested such a work of Stravinsky.Igor Stravinsky, Concerto for Piano and Wind Instruments, revised edition 1950 (Hawkes Pocket Scores 724, London and New York: Boosey & Hawkes, 1960), Stravinsky made his British radio debut in the British premiere of the work, on June 19, 1927, with the Wireless Symphony Orchestra (the fore- runner of the BBC Symphony Orchestra)Lewis Foreman, Susan Foreman, London: A Musical Gazetteer conducted by his friend and champion Edward Clark.Gareth James Thomas, The Impact of Russian Music in England 1893-1929 Sources *Boosey.com ReferencesExternal links *Live performance streaming file performed by Dr. Willis G.

Arrest  On 4 November 2017, Bakr bin Laden was arrested in Saudi Arabia in a \\"corruption crackdown\\" conducted by a new royal anti-corruption committee and detained without trial. This was done on authority of Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman. Bakr was initially detained at The Ritz-Carlton, Riyadh and later held in a publicly-unknown location. The Saudi government also seized the deed to a villa owned by Bakr overlooking the Red Sea. In January 2019 the kingdom quietly released Bakr bin Laden together with several other prominent detainees. Among those reportedly released were Mohammed al-Amoudi, a businessman who owns much of Ethiopia and Amr Dabbagh, a former government minister who once led the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority, which aims to attract foreign investment. The move came amid unprecedented global pressure of the kingdom and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman after the assassination of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents at the country’s consulate in Istanbul.https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia- corruption-purge.htmlhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-27/saudi- ethiopian-billionaire-al-amoudi-released-in-saudi-arabia  Education  Bakr bin Laden attended college at the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida, United States in 1979.

Prior to the start of the 1992–1995 war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Turajlić was the director of the multifaceted Bosnian company Energoinvest and as such secured large sums of money for the defense of the country. He was known for his democratic attitude and ability to cooperate, especially for persuading everyone through his own self-denial and hard work. His death at the hands of the Bosnian Serb Army in Stup was one of the great losses that the government was to sustain during the war.  Death  Dutch journalist Robert Dulmers beside Hakija Turajlić's grave at the Ali Pasha mosque located in central Sarajevo. On 8 January 1993 Hakija Turajlić went to Sarajevo International Airport to greet Orhan Sefa Kilercioğlu who accompanied an aid shipment from Turkey. In order to return to Sarajevo he had to pass through Serb-controlled territory for which UNPROFOR was supposed to provide protection. The UN convoy which was taking Turajlić to Sarajevo was stopped by Serb soldiers at an illegal roadblock a few kilometers from the airport. After a 90-minute standoff a French UNPROFOR officer opened the door to the armoured personnel carrier in which Turajlić was sitting and a Serb soldier opened fire with an AK-47. Turajlić was hit with 7–8 rounds. The French troops did not return fire, call for reinforcements — less than six hundred yards away — or detain the killers. British troops who arrived on the scene were ordered to leave. When the same French peacekeepers came home to France, they were decorated for heroism. His murder strained relations between the Bosnian government and UNPROFOR and was also the reason that peace talks in Geneva were cancelled. The UN and the Serbs both refused to cooperate with the Bosnian government investigation and help find the killer. A Bosnian Serb soldier, Goran Vasić, was eventually charged with Turajlić's murder but ultimately acquitted of that charge in 2002.WORLD; In Brief. Washington Post, 4 January 2002. Quote:\\"A Sarajevo court has convicted a Bosnian Serb soldier of committing war crimes against prisoners but acquitted him of killing the country's deputy prime minister. Goran Vasić was sentenced to 4½ years in prison, local media reported. He was convicted on charges of beating prisoners at the Medjarici camp in Sarajevo during the country's 1992–1995 war. The court said it lacked evidence to convict him of killing Hakija Turajlić, the deputy prime minister of Bosnia in 1992.\\" In 1998, a wall about ten meters long and just under two meters high, reminiscent of the Berlin Wall, was put up by Serb residents in Dobrinja after the Bosnian police entered disputed territory under Serb control to arrest Vasić.

Early life Born in the suburb of the capital Belgrade, Isakov attended primary school in the villages of Tovariševo and Silbaš near Bačka Palanka. He then completed secondary education (gymnasium) in Novi Sad and also attended high school in Carsonville, a village in the US state of Michigan. In 1974, he graduated from the University of Novi Sad's Faculty of Philosophy with a degree in Yugoslav literature. In 1975 he got a job at TV Novi Sad, a state-run broadcaster where he stayed until 1994. During the late 1980s he wrote the screenplay of the comedy series Specijalna redakcija starring Đorđe Balašević, Bogdan Diklić, Aleksandar Berček, Emir Hadžihafizbegović, and Mira Banjac among others.Nastavak kultne serije „Specijalna redakcija“, Blic, July 29, 2009 Politics His party was part of the wide DOS coalition that won power in FR Yugoslavia (federal level) and Serbia (republic level) in 2000.

The airport is north of the city of Yamagata.Dodd, Jan et al. (2001). History Kamiyama Training Airfield was opened by the Imperial Japanese Navy in World War II. It was briefly used by the United States military after the war and then by the Japanese Self-Defense Force as a training facility. In June 1964, it was turned over to civilian control as “Jinmachi Airport” (神町空港), a third-class regional airport. It was renamed Yamagata Airport in 1965. A helicopter detachment from the JGSDF 6th Division has been based at the airport since 1969. The runway was extended to 1500 meters in 1972, and the airport was re- designated as Class-II in 1979. The runway was further extended to 2000 meters in 1981 and a new terminal building completed in 1984. Regularly scheduled services began in 1964, with All Nippon Airways operating Fokker F.27 service to Tokyo (Haneda). The service was upgraded to YS-11s in 1972 and to Boeing 737s in 1976. By 1985 ANA offered five daily flights to Haneda, one of which was operated by a widebody Boeing 767. Japan Air System began service to Osaka (Itami) and Sapporo in 1979. International charter service commenced in 1981, and the airport hosted long-haul charters to countries such as Finland, Hungary, New Zealand and Mexico. The number of passengers using the airport peaked in 1991 and declined precipitously, particularly on the Tokyo route, due to the completion of the Yamagata Shinkansen in 1992. The Tokyo route saw 470,618 passengers in 1991 but was down to 43,447 passengers in 2002. All Nippon Airways suspended the Tokyo service and withdrew from the airport in 2002, with JAS resuming the route as a single daily MD-87 service in 2003. JAS also operated an Osaka (Kansai) service from 1995 to 2002, and a Fukuoka service from 2006 to 2008, while Nakanihon Airlines operated a summer seasonal Hakodate service from 1998 to 2001. Currently, the airport is served by JAL and FDA using an Embraer 170 to Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya. During the aftermath of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami, American troops used Yamagata Airport as a base for transporting fuel and materials to the disaster areas (part of Operation Tomodachi). According to the Ministry of Defense, this was the first time that the U.S. military had used a private airport in Japan for anything other than emergency landings.\\"Japan-U.S. relief efforts expanding,\\" The Daily Yomiuri (Japan).

During World War II, she appeared as the pin-up girl in the March 1944 issue of Yank magazine. She made a string of successful pictures, although she is today best remembered for playing Rosalind Russell's sister in My Sister Eileen (1942) and Rita Hayworth's best friend in Tonight and Every Night (1945). In the 1947 film The Fabulous Dorseys, Blair returned to her musical roots, portraying a singer.

It is owned and operated by JASDF and shares the runway with civil activities. History Yonago Airport Entrance The airport was built as an Imperial Japanese Army Air Force airfield during World War II, and was attacked by USAAF B-24 Liberator bombers during July 1945. After the war, the airfield was taken over by the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF) in Japan. The Royal Australian Air Force No. 5 Airfield Construction Squadron refurbished the airfield, and No. 77 Squadron was stationed at the airfield until 1950. In December 1950, the United States Air Force 452d Bombardment Wing moved B-26 Invader light bombers to Miho Air Base. They moved to Pusan East (K-9) Air Base, South Korea in May 1951 for combat duty during the Korean War. The only other operational USAF unit to use the airfield was the 17th Bombardment Wing, which also flew B-26s from the field between October 1954 and March 1955 before returning to the United States. Miho Air Base was used primarily as a radar station by the 618th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron beginning in December 1950, operating defensive radar sites as part of the air defense of Japan until May 1957. The 6135th Support Squadron maintained airfield facilities and a small ground station. The Air Weather Service 15th Weather Squadron also used the airfield, along with transient C-47 Skytrain transports carrying supplies and personnel. USAF units were withdrawn and Miho Air Base was returned to Japanese control in May 1957 as part of a general drawdown of American forces in Japan. Present=JASDF The Japan Air Self Defense Force has operated a number of transports at Miho Air Base including Curtiss C-46 Commando and NAMC YS-11 aircraft. During 23–25 October 2015, a British Royal Air Force (RAF) A400M Atlas transport aircraft visited Miho Air Base. It was the first time for an RAF aircraft to land at a JASDF base.

Near the Bahama Islands, the lighter aqua colors indicate shallow water, where the sunlight reflects off the sand and reefs near the surface. The \\"color\\" of the ocean is determined by the interactions of incident light with substances or particles present in the water. White sunlight consists of a spectrum of wavelengths (about 400–700 nm), which water droplets disperse into a continuous spectrum of \\"rainbow\\" colors. Large quantities of water, even in a swimming pool, would appear blue as well. When light shines on the water surface, the different colors are absorbed, transmitted, scattered, or reflected in differing intensities by water molecules and other so-called optically active constituents in suspension in the upper layer (called the epipelagic or photic zone) of the ocean. The reason that open-ocean waters appear blue under clear conditions midday is due to the absorption and scattering of light. The wavelengths of blue are scattered, similar to the scattering of blue light in the sky, but absorption is a much larger factor than scattering for the clear ocean water. In water, absorption is strong in the red and weak in the blue, and so red is absorbed quickly in the ocean, leaving blue. Almost all sunlight that enters the ocean is absorbed, except very near the coast. The wavelengths of red, yellow, and green are absorbed by water molecules in the ocean. When sunlight strikes the ocean, some of the light is reflected back directly, but most of it penetrates the ocean surface and interacts with the water molecules that it encounters. The wavelengths of red, orange, yellow, and green are absorbed, and so the remaining light we see is composed of the shorter wavelengths of blues and violets. Any particles suspended in the water will increase the scattering of light. In coastal areas, runoff from rivers; resuspension of sand and silt from the bottom by tides, waves, and storms; and a number of other substances can change the color of the near-shore waters. Some types of particles can also contain substances that absorb certain wavelengths of light, which alters its characteristics. For example, microscopic marine algae, called phytoplankton, have the capacity to absorb light in the blue and red region of the spectrum, owing to specific pigments like chlorophyll. Accordingly, as the concentration of phytoplankton increases in the water, the color of the water shifts toward the green part of the spectrum. Fine mineral particles like sediment absorb light in the blue part of the spectrum, causing the water to turn brownish if there is a massive sediment load. The most important light-absorbing substance in the oceans is chlorophyll, which phytoplankton use to produce carbon by photosynthesis. Chlorophyll, a green pigment, makes phytoplankton preferentially absorb the red and blue portions of the light spectrum and reflect green light. Ocean regions with high concentrations of phytoplankton have shades of blue-green depending upon the type and density of the phytoplankton population there. The basic principle behind the remote sensing of ocean color from space is that the more phytoplankton is in the water, the greener it is. There are other substances that may be found dissolved in the water that can also absorb light. Since the substances are usually composed of organic carbon, researchers generally refer to them as colored dissolved organic matter. Ocean color radiometry Ocean color radiometry is a technology, and a discipline of research, concerning the study of the interaction between the visible electromagnetic radiation coming from the sun and aquatic environments. In general, the term is used in the context of remote-sensing observations, often made from Earth-orbiting satellites. Using sensitive radiometers, such as those on-board satellite platforms, one can measure carefully the wide array of colors emerging out of the ocean. These measurements can be used to infer important information such as phytoplankton biomass or concentrations of other living and non-living material that modify the characteristics of the incoming radiation. Monitoring the spatial and temporal variability of algal blooms from satellite, over large marine regions up to the scale of the global ocean, has been instrumental in characterizing variability of marine ecosystems and is a key tool for research into how marine ecosystems respond to climate change and anthropogenic perturbations. History Remote sensing of ocean colour from space began in 1978 with the successful launch of NASA's Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS). Despite the fact that CrZCS was an experimental mission intended to last only one year, the sensor continued to generate a valuable time-series of data over selected test sites until early 1986. Ten years passed before other sources of ocean-colour data became available with the launch of other sensors, and in particular the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view sensor (SeaWiFS) in 1997 on board the NASA SeaStar satellite. Subsequent sensors have included NASA's Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board the Aqua and Tearra satellites, ESA's MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) onboard its environmental satellite Envisat. Several new ocean-colour sensors have recently been launched, including the Indian Ocean Colour Monitor (OCM-2) on-board ISRO's Oceansat-2 satellite and the Korean Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI), which is the first ocean colour sensor to be launched on a geostationary satellite, and Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) aboard NASA's Suomi NPP . More ocean colour sensors are planned over the next decade by various space agencies. Ocean Colour Radiometry and its derived products are also seen as fundamental Essential Climate Variables as defined by the Global Climate Observing System. Ocean colour datasets provide the only global synoptic perspective of primary production in the oceans, giving insight into the role of the world's oceans in the global carbon cycle. Applications Ocean colour data is a vital resource for a wide variety of operational forecasting and oceanographic research, earth sciences, and related applications, as well as in many of the Societal Benefit Areas identified by the Group on Earth Observations. A few examples of some of the ways that ocean colour data and related data types have been used include. *Harmful Algal Bloom Forecasting System: The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Harmful Algal Bloom Forecasting System utilizes ocean colour data in conjunction with meteorological data and field sampling to forecast the development and movement of harmful algal blooms (commonly referred to as \\"red tides\\") in the Gulf of Mexico. *Linking Agricultural Practices to Phytoplankton Blooms: Ocean colour data indicate that when Mexican farmers add fertilizer to the fields, the fertilizer flows to the ocean and triggers phytoplankton growth in the Gulf of California.

University of Toronto/Université Laval. Retrieved 2013-12-10. – January 12, 1893) was the first Anglican Bishop of Moosonee, Canada, who for more than forty years led services in Cree, Inuit and other languages of his parishioners. Early life Horden was born in Exeter, England, the eldest son of William Horden (a printer) and Sarah Seward, and received his early schooling at St. John's School, paid for by charitable donations. He was apprenticed to a blacksmith while still a child, spending his spare time improving his education. By attending night school and studying during odd moments, he was in time able to become a teacher and schoolmaster. He took advantage of the opportunities to study given him there and eventually learned to read Latin and Greek. Horden was an active member of his local Church of England congregation (Church of St. Thomas the Apostle, Exeter) and regularly attended the vicar's Bible class, which offered information on the mission opportunities available in addition to a Biblical education. With two other students, he expressed his interest in the mission field and they met to pray and study. After some time they all volunteered for the Church Missionary Society and two were accepted. Horden was rejected and told that he was still thought too young to be a church leader in \\"heathen\\" areas. He was, however, encouraged to continue his schooling and was told that he would hear from the Society when they needed someone. Arrival in Hudson's Bay Territory On May 10, 1851, Horden received a letter from them, informing him that the Bishop of Rupert's Land, had made a request for a schoolmaster at Moose Factory, territory of the Hudson's Bay Company, and that he had been appointed to fill the position. They also told him to prepare to leave within a month and indicated that they desired that he marry and take his wife out to assist him in his missionary work. He immediately prepared for his new position. He contacted his fiancée of one year, Elizabeth Baker Oke (1826–1908), a teacher who trained at The Home and Colonial School Society (Gray’s Inn Road, London), and someone who also had missionary aspirations, and they quickly married (May 28, 1851). Horden was to assume the role of catechist, to superintend the schools and to be a scripture reader at the Sunday services. Elizabeth was charged with supervising the girl’s schools and teaching the Indian women. In London, Horden met with Reverend George Barnley, a Wesleyan Methodist missionary at Moose Factory until 1847, who introduced him to some basic Cree language and its symbolic writing. On June 8, 1851, the young couple set sail for North America. Horden spent much of his time on the trip by continuing his studies of the Greek Testament and of the Cree language. He benefited from the prior experience of several of the crew of the ship with the language and had developed a small vocabulary by the end of the voyage. He also learned to play the accordion. Elizabeth's first pupil was onboard, a woman returning to Hudson's Bay. The ship arrived at Moose River on August 26 and the passengers were delivered to Moose Factory. The young couple lived at the residence of Chief Factor Robert Miles, affording them some time to acclimate to the daily routines at Moose Factory before moving into the repaired Methodist parsonage just ahead of winter. It was Miles who had persistently urged for a replacement for Barnley at the mission, having lost his two front teeth, he remarked \\"…it is a labor for me now to read the service.\\" Horden engaged a young native in conversation, making several mistakes initially. He found that prior missionaries had already created a translation of the Lord's Prayer and a few biblical texts, and he used the existing transliteration system to help him in his own studies. He continued to go among the natives, writing down new words as he heard them and, after eight months' effort, becoming able to preach to the natives without an interpreter. Horden created his own version of the Lord's Prayer, later translating the Apostle's Creed, the Ten Commandments, some prayers from services, a few hymns, and some passages of scripture, all of which he copied and circulated among the natives. He used the opportunity he had at the mission school to teach the adults and children how to read and write, and the fundamentals of Christianity. Horden also worked to address the spiritual needs of the staff of the Hudson's Bay Company at Moose Factory. They were very grateful and, along with the native parishioners, repaired the church, improved the residence that he and his family used, and built a schoolhouse. Mission priest and Cree bible After one year, Bishop David Anderson of Rupert's Land visited the mission, and decided to ordain Horden as a priest (August 24, 1852) to better serve this location rather than replace him. Although the Bishop and Horden discussed establishing a central residential school in the future, the schools continued to operate as day schools. Beginners were first taught by natives in their own language, then, they progressed to the English school. This became a long-standing practice, and in 1879 the Diocese indicated that their schools aimed to teach \\"every child, whether European, half-caste, or Indian\\" to read and write in their own language. Funding was obtained through the Coral Missionary Society, largely through the efforts of Beatrice Batty and other editors of its magazine, to create a foster care program for orphans. These children were cared for in the homes of native families in the settlement, remaining part of Cree society, and could attend school, which was not compulsory. A summer school program was established for Cree children living in outlying areas, who were educated in their own language. Horden prepared a prayer book, a hymnal, and translations of the Gospels in the Cree language, and sent them to England with an order for a thousand copies. The printer had no proofreader capable of reading the print, and decided the person who created the manuscript would probably be best qualified to check it. On that basis, in 1853, they returned the manuscript to him, with a printing press specially prepared. However, they did not include the instructions on how to operate it. Horden spent his free time studying the mechanism and operation of the machine for several days, leading his neighbors to wonder what was bothering him. Then one day he came running to the camp waving a sheet of paper over his head, shouting, \\"Come, see this thing!\\" They followed him and saw the first sheet Horden had printed. Horden proudly told them that he would now be able to give them books. For the next several years, he and his students printed and bound books which were distributed throughout the region, substantially increasing the awareness of and interest in Christianity in the area. Bishop Robert Machray visited the area and was very impressed by Horden's achievements. He licensed four of Horden's lay readers to conduct services and read the Scriptures among their fellows, the first time a bishop licensed lay readers in any of the stations of the Church Missionary Society. Over several years, John Horden worked with E. A. Watkins at Fort George to produce religious material in syllabics for Inuit. In 1865, when they were both in London, they spent time together modifying the Cree syllabic system to the Inuktitut language. Family Island life in this remote territory was both exerting and fulfilling. The settlement was mainly inhabited by the Cree, connected to the mainland by an ice road in the winter, and home to an international community of Hudson's Bay Company employees at the post. Severe famine and flooding were not uncommon, with Horden remarking that during the spring thaw of 1857, every house on the island flooded, \\"having five feet nine inches deep in my own kitchen.\\" Epidemic outbreaks of influenza struck in the winter and whooping cough plagued them in the summer. In 1858, Horden and his young family traveled north to visit Eskimo at Little Whale River. On their return to Moose Factory, they realized they had just escaped an outbreak of whooping cough that claimed 32 lives, including that of \\"Little Susan\\", a native orphan who the Hordens had raised from infancy. Horden and Elizabeth had six children, five of whom survived infancy: Elizabeth Anderson Horden (b. 1852) named for Bishop Anderson, John Oke Horden (b. ~1854), who became a physician and surgeon in Middlesex, England and to whose home his mother retired in later life, Christiana Seward Horden (b. 1856), who married William Kelk Broughton (District Manager and Chief Trader at Albany, Rupert's House and Moose Factory, awarded Gold medal and two bars), Beatrice Campbell Horden (b. 1863), and baby \\"Bertie\\", Herbert Henry Horden (b. 1866), who also became a doctor in Middlesex, England but died in 1904 from poisoning. Daughter Ellen Hudson Horden (1860–1861), named after her place of birth, was buried at Moose Factory. After delaying their plans of a furlough for an entire year due to a ship-wreck, in 1865 Horden and his family sailed back to England through icebergs and freezing storms, and Thomas Vincent was placed in charge of the mission. Upon Horden's return to England, he found he was very well known throughout the British Isles, and became a popular and sought-after speaker. In 1867, Horden returned overland from Montreal to James Bay, travelling the last 1200 miles by canoe with Elizabeth and their two youngest children, having left the three older children to be educated in England. Horden later remarked on his \\"loneliness\\", missing his children in England. Horden and Elizabeth traveled to England again in the fall of 1880. At that time her mother Jane Oke, a widow since 1846 who had worked as a dress maker, was living in \\"Free Cottages\\" at St. David, Devonshire and Elizabeth's unmarried sister Christiana, an upholsteress, was living there also. When Horden returned to Hudson's Bay in 1882, Elizabeth now 56 years of age, remained behind to attend to her family in England and was active in raising contributions for the Moosonee Association until her death in 1908. When Horden went on furlough for the last time in May 1888, his daughter \\"Chrissie\\" and her children accompanied him for one day, and his young grandson, William Kelk Broughton, Jr. (aged 11 years) continued further until the remaining traveling party turned back to Moose Factory. Consecration In the autumn of 1872, Horden received a message to return to England to be consecrated as a bishop. Elizabeth remained behind to look after the affairs at Moose Factory. On December 15, 1872, he and two others were ordained in a ceremony at Westminster Abbey involving eight other bishops, including Bishop Anderson, who had first ordained Horden 20 years earlier. Horden served as bishop for a huge territory, and made pastoral visits to as many parts of the diocese as possible, including York Factory via Winnipeg, despite his having a serious problem with rheumatism. Once the bishop arrived at these distant parishes, he had a full day that could include, an early morning service in Cree, then a service in Inuit, later another Cree service that would include marriages and baptisms, then later, the English service. Over the course of forty-one years, Horden built five Anglican churches to serve the diocese. New construction at Moose Factory was undertaken in 1856 for St. Thomas' Anglican Church to replace an older building, but it was carried nearly a quarter-mile in a flood in 1860. Construction resumed in 1864, but was not completed until 1885. In his later years, he also worked diligently to finish his translation of the Bible into the Cree language, and also Ojibwa, Inuktitut, Chipewyan, and Norwegian (the language of some Hudson's Bay Company employees).http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio.php?id_nbr=6166 Horden wrote several books and his \\"A grammar of the Cree language, as spoken by the Cree Indians of North America\\" (London, 1881) is considered one of his most significant linguistic achievements. Death and legacy On November 21, 1892, the pain was more acute than ever, and despite the care and assistance of his family, his health continued to wane. John Horden died on January 12, 1893, and was buried in the Hudson's Bay Company graveyard in Moose Factory, beside his infant daughter Ellen Hudson Horden (1860–1861) and infant grandson Henry Seward Broughton (1883), who died from a whooping cough epidemic at the Albany post. There is a monument to Horden (1895), under canopy at the North Wall of Nave, Cathedral Church of Saint Peter at Exeter. Three 1893 design sketches for the memorial by sculptor Herbert Read, depicting an island scene of the bishop and natives, are held at the Devon Heritage Centre. St. John's Hospital School on High Street, Exeter, where Horden attended the English Free School as a child, erected a monument to Horden in the wall, inscribed with a biography and closing with \\"Faithful unto Death\\". Little remained of the building after it was bombed in May 1942. In 1938, a replacement building for the mission school (first opened by Horden in 1855) was named \\"Bishop Horden Memorial School\\", and this was replaced in 1953 by a building named \\"Horden Hall\\". By 1964 classes at Horden Hall were phased out as students attended public school and the hall served only as a hostel. The Calendar of Saints of the Episcopal Church (USA) remembers Rt. Rev. Horden on December 15 (together with fellow missionary and translator Robert McDonald) and the Calendar of Saints of the Anglican Church of Canada remembers his service on January 12.

The car was part of a brief partnership between Konrad Motorsport and Lamborghini. Development At the time of the development of the KM-011, Konrad Motorsport was competing with Porsche 962s in the World Sportscar Championship. Konrad was a long time Porsche campaigner, but knew that for 1992 his 962 would no longer be legal to run in the series, and Porsche had no planned replacement. Thus Konrad would need to either buy a customer chassis or build his own car, as well as find a new engine supplier to meet the new 3.5 Liter formula. To meet the engine requirement, Konrad turned to Lamborghini and their owner at the time, Chrysler, planning to use the Formula One engine that the company currently supplied to Ligier and Modena. At the time, both Formula One and World Sportscar Championship engine requirements were the same, allowing for teams to build engines for both series. Thus in order to allow Lamborghini to expand into sportscars involvement following the failure of the Countach QVX, they agreed to supply their 3512 V12. For the chassis, team founder Franz Konrad hired Geoff Kingston, who would set about designing the car that would become known as the KM-011. The design of the car was rather simple, borrowing established design features from such cars as Konrad's own 962. Among the main attributes was a larger, more squared off front end and a large roof-mounted hood scoop to better feed the engine, similar in style to other newer 3.5 liter Group C cars. The car would run on Yokohama tires and be primarily sponsored by Wärtsilä Diesel Group, as well as carrying some sponsorship for Chrysler in some rounds. Racing history For the 1991 season, Konrad initially ran their 962, scoring a handful of points in the first four races of the season. At round five at the team's home event of the Nürburgring, Konrad debuted the KM-011 in the hands of drivers Franz Konrad and Stefan Johansson. Unfortunately the car failed to qualify for the event, and Konrad instead turned to his older 962, taking a points-scoring finish. At the next round at Magny-Cours, the car was successful in qualifying, allowing Konrad to abandon their 962, but unfortunately the KM-011 failed to finish after 18 laps due to a failed starter motor. Wishing to finish the season, Franz Konrad gathered the budget to fly the KM-011 and Konrad Motorsport team to the final two rounds of the season in Mexico City and Autopolis, Japan. In Mexico the KM-011 lasted 36 laps before its gearbox gave out. This was followed by suspension failure at Autopolis after a mere 24 laps. With this, the KM-011 failed to score any points in the World Sportscar Championship season, the 962 being the only car to score. However, during the break from Mexico City to Autopolis, Konrad had the KM-011 flown back to Europe to participate in the final Interserie round at Zeltweg. In the first heat, Franz Konrad drove the KM-011 on his own to a 7th-place finish. The second heat saw the KM-011 suffered problems and failed to finish three laps from the finish. The combined results therefore gave the KM-011 a 16th-place finish, classified as a finisher. The KM-011 would make one final appearance at the first Interserie round at the Nürburgring in 1992. The car would take 3rd place in the first heat, followed by a 4th place in the second. This combined result earned Konrad an overall 4th-place finish in the race. Unfortunately funding for the project would soon end. Although Konrad promised to be on the grid for the 1992 World Sportscar Championship season, the car never showed. This would be the only car that Konrad would build themselves. They would return to running customer cars, mostly Porsches, following the retirement of the KM-011.

The play was produced on Broadway in 1945 and was the maiden production of the now acclaimed New York Circle in the Square Theatre in 1951. This was followed by a national tour and eventually numerous college and high- school productions. It is also revived professionally, e.g. by Pittsburgh's Quantum Theatre in 2005. The original London production 1948 – 1949, at the Ambassadors Theatre, was an early much admired production by the distinguished director Peter Brook. Set in the Appalachian Mountains and written in an Appalachian dialect, the play centers on the character of John, a witch boy who seeks to become human after falling in love with a human girl, Barbara Allen. Originally written by Howard Richardson in 1939 as a dramatization of the centuries-old European folk song \\"The Ballad of Barbara Allen\\", it was first performed at the University of Iowa in 1942 under the title Barbara Allen. After a rewrite by Richardson's cousin, William Berney, it was presented at the Brattle Playhouse in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The Shuberts saw it and transferred it (mainly re-cast) to Broadway at the Richard Rodgers Theatre (named at the time the 46th Street Theatre), where it ran from March 14, 1945 to December 15, 1945, directed by Robert E. Perry. \\" 'Dark of the Moon' Broadway\\" ibdb.com, accessed September 8, 2016 The New York Times reviewed a 1991 \\"rare revival\\" in New Jersey, referring to the many high school and college productions, but rare professional attempts. Although Dark of the Moon is not a musical, it was originally billed as a \\"legend with music\\" and characters do sing in most productions.Encyclopedia of Alabama: William Berney Paul Newman and Richard Hart once played the role of John. Characters and story This perennial favorite is based on the haunting folk ballad of \\"Barbara Allen.\\" Employing a large cast and imaginative settings in the Smoky Mountains, it recounts the story of John, a strange \\"witch boy\\" who upon first beholding the beautiful Barbara Allen immediately falls in love. He is given human form to woo and marry her on the condition that she remain true to him. The marriage is consummated and Barbara gives birth to a witch child whom the townspeople destroy in a superstitious frenzy. During a religious revival Barbara is led to betray John thus breaking their spell of love. As she dies, he returns forever to the world of the mountain witches.

O Barbara will you marry me, And will you leave me never, Oh yes, my love, I'll marry you, And live with you ferever. Three other alternate verses were used in the 1953 production of \\"Dark of the Moon\\" at the Totem Pole Playhouse: I'll sing a song from down our way From the mountains where I'm dwellin' 'bout a witch boy almost got a soul Fer the love of Barbry Allen Was in the merry month of May The greenbuds they was swellin' A witch boy saw a mountain gal And wished that he was human. Oh can you hear, how loud and clear The church bells are a-ringin' The valley folk from round about Have come to git religion. Through no doin' of her own, Poor Barbara was unfaithful, She lost her life on the mountain high, And ne'er no more was witch boy human. They laid poor Barbra by the old church gate, With the wild, wild rose growin' nigh her, And witch boy roamed the mountain high, 'Til mountain fog became him. And then one morn, before the dawn, The fog rolled down that mountain, It came to rest nigh Barbara's rose, and watered there a briar. The rose and briar climbed the old church gate, 'Til they could grow no higher, And there they tied in a true love's knot, The rose wrapped 'round the briar.

Other songs in the show *\\"Down in the Valley\\", sung by Floyd Allen. *\\"Give Me That Old Time Religion\\" and \\"Lonesome Valley\\", sung at the church. Reactions Dark of the Moon is a controversial drama and is not recommended for young children. It challenges an audience's comfort level regarding ideas of tolerance, justice, and pressures from diametrically opposed worlds. In the late 1990s, the town of Honey Grove, Texas launched a campaign to halt the production at the local high school, citing protection of the underage against inappropriate and lewd material. The campaign extended to the Texas UIL One Act Play State Meet where there were two productions of Dark of the Moon, with one of the plays placing third at the 1998 State Meet. At Carleton College, Northfield, Minnesota, the theater group, Players, performed the play in 1963. Folk music was popular at the time and some campus \\"folkies\\" replaced the old musical numbers in the play with current favorites. The play was a great success. The production was directed by John R (\\"Jack\\") Woodruff and featured a number of Carleton students including Erica Rosenfeld, Jim Ekberg, and Jack Turner.

Forts Edward and William Henry are near the bottom of this map. This battle probably took place somewhere west of the hills near Sabbathday Point. The 1758 Battle on Snowshoes occurred on March 13, 1758, during the French and Indian War. It was fought by members of British Ranger companies led by Robert Rogers against French troops and Indians allied to France. The battle took place near Lake George, now in northern New York, but then in the frontier area between the British province of New York and the French province of Canada. The battle was given its name because the British combatants were wearing snowshoes. Rogers led a band of about 180 rangers and regulars out to scout French positions. The French commander at Fort Carillon had been alerted to their movement, and sent a force consisting mostly of Indians to meet them. In fierce fighting, the British troop was nearly destroyed, with more than 120 casualties. The French believed that Rogers was killed in this action, as he was forced to abandon his regimental jacket, which contained his commission papers, during his escape from the scene. This battle gave rise to the tale that Rogers escaped capture by sliding down a rockface to the frozen surface of Lake George. That rock is now known as Rogers Rock or Rogers Slide. Background The French and Indian War broke out in 1754 between British and French colonists over territorial disputes along their colonial frontiers, and escalated the following year to include regular troops.Brumwell (2004), p. 55 By 1756, the French had enjoyed successes in most of their frontier battles against the British. Their only notable failure occurred when the British stopped their southward advance from Lake Champlain in the 1755 Battle of Lake George. From bases at Fort St. Frédéric (located at what is now Crown Point, New York) and Fort Carillon (known to the British as Fort Ticonderoga), the French and their Indian allies continued to scout and probe the British defenses on Lake George and the upper Hudson River.Brumwell (2004), pp. 59–82 The British, who had fewer Indian allies, resorted to companies of colonial rangers for their scouting and reconnaissance activities.Brumwell (2004), pp. 70–71 The ranger companies were organized and directed by Robert Rogers, and eventually became known as Rogers' Rangers.Brumwell (2004), pp. 103–105 Prelude Captain Rogers was sent on a reconnaissance mission from Fort Edward northwards toward Fort Carillon on March 10, 1758.Nester (2008), p. 9 Lieutenant Colonel William Haviland, the fort's commander, had originally planned on 400 men taking part but reduced the number to 180,Rogers (1883), p. 93 even though he had reason to believe the French knew of the expedition. The French had captured a man from an earlier expedition by Israel Putnam's Connecticut rangers and it was suspected that he had informed his captors of the British plans. Putnam's reconnaissance revealed that there were an estimated 600 Indians encamped near Fort Carillon. The expedition was composed mostly of men from Rogers' ranger companies, but it also included a few volunteer soldiers from the 27th (Inniskilling) Regiment.Nester (2008), p. 10 On March 13, they wore snowshoes as they marched through snow four feet deep, with a rivulet to their left and a steep mountain separating them from Lake George to their right. They had stopped for a three-hour break when their advance guard spotted what Rogers reported as \\"ninety-six, chiefly Indians\\".Rogers (1883), p. 96 On March 12, Captain Louis-Philippe Le Dossu d'Hébécourt, the French commander at Fort Carillon, heard rumors from the encamped Indians that the British were nearing. He sent Ensign Durantaye with a company of 200 Nipissing Indians and about 20 Canadians in response to these reports, but they found nothing. The next day two Indian scouts reported that they had found tracks of an enemy party. Around noon on March 13, Durantaye led 100 men (again a mixed company of Indians and Canadians) out of the fort. These were followed shortly after by 200 Indians under Ensign de Langy.Nester (2008), p. 15 Although the two French groups joined forces, Durantaye's company was about ahead of Langy's when they were spotted by Rogers' men.Nester (2008), p. 16 Battle Rogers' men immediately set up an ambush. When Durantaye's men came within range at 14:00, the British opened fire, killing \\"above forty Indians\\", according to Rogers. Durantaye's force broke and retreated in disarray. Rogers and about half his men gave chase, critically forgetting to reload their muskets, while the others stopped to collect scalps.Brumwell (2004), p. 114 Langy's men, alerted by the gunfire, set up their own ambush. When Rogers' men arrived, the attack by Langy's force killed or wounded an estimated 50 men. The Rangers fought bravely, considering they were outnumbered and their numbers were falling quickly. They made several successful attempts to prevent themselves from being flanked, but after an hour and a half of heavy fighting, their numbers were significantly reduced. The remnants of the British force then tried to escape the battle. Rogers and some of his men did get away, but one group of men surrendered, only to be killed and scalped when a scalp was discovered in a pocket of one of the men.Brumwell (2004), p. 115 Aftermath Rogers and his decimated company returned to Fort Edward on March 15.Rogers (1883), p. 99 Rogers himself was originally reported by the French to have been killed, but had actually survived. The report stemmed from the manner of Rogers' escape during which he discarded some of his belongings, including his regimental coat, which contained his military commission.Brumwell (2004), p. 117 This episode also gave rise to a local legend that Rogers escaped the battle by sliding 400 feet down the side of a hill to the frozen surface of Lake George. While there is no proof of this event, the rockface he supposedly went down very quickly became known as Rogers' Slide.Brumwell (2004), p. 118 Reports of casualties, and of the numbers of forces involved, starkly differed in this battle. Rogers' report of the event estimated the French-Indian force at 700, with one to two hundred casualties, and his accounts of the battle were doubted by a variety of commentators, as they were inconsistent with other accounts. A letter by Henry Pringle, written while held in captivity at Carillon, restored his reputation by clarifying the French advantage following the second ambush; Rogers went on to rebuild his companies and serve in the Battle of Carillon in July 1758.Brumwell (2004), p. 119–124 See also *Battle of Carillon *List of conflicts in Canada NotesReferences Further reading .

Numbering about 970,000 by the late 1800s, they originated in northern Nigeria. The Gbaya were known for their strong resistance to the French and slavery, and revolted against them for three years starting in 1928 when they were conscripted to work on the Congo-Ocean railway. In rural areas, the Gbaya cultivate mainly maize, cassava, yams, peanuts, tobacco, coffee and rice, the latter two of which were introduced by the French. Today, many of the Gbaya people are Christians, though witchcraft is practiced, known as dua. History The Gbaya numbered about 970,000 by the late 1800s, after fleeing the holy war of Usman dan Fodio in the Hausa area of northern Nigeria early in the century. In what is now northern Cameroon they experienced conflict with the Fulani ethnic group. The Gbaya were resistant to the French colonialists in the early 20th century. In the early 1920s there was a strong backlash after many of them were enslaved as porters and labourers, and developed into a revolt in 1928-1931 when conscription was introduced in the building of the Congo-Ocean railway. The Gbaya people felt discriminated against in the political sphere, even after independence from the French. It was only in the 1990s that a notable number of Gbaya leaders began to be admitted into higher administrative positions in government. More recent estimates of the population differ markedly, from 1.2 million, down to 685,100, of which 358,000 are native to Cameroon. Sub groups and languages Gbaya throwing knife. Subgroups of the Gbaya include the Bokoto, Kara, Kaka, Buli, and Bwaka. The Gbaya speak a language of the Adamawa-Ubangi subgroup of the Niger-Congo language family. Economic and cultural practices In rural areas, the Gbaya cultivate mainly maize, cassava (staple food), yams, peanuts, tobacco, coffee and rice, the latter two of which were introduced by the French. The diamond industry took off in the late 1930s and still remains important. The agriculture method of Gbaya is called \\"swidden\\", a type of \\"slash and burn\\" farming where the forest is cleared, vegetation burnt on top of the cleared land, the farm used for a few years, then abandoned and the families move to a new area. The Gbaya make an alcoholic beverage prepared with honey which is known as kuri. Kam, is a Gbaya porridge made from cassava. Today, most of the Gbaya people are Christians (50% Protestant, 33% Catholic), about 12% follows original indigenous beliefs, with only a minority of Muslims (3%). Witchcraft is known to be practiced, and is known to the people as dua. Stories and rituals of the Gbaya people are a feature of everyday society.

It has been conjectured that he was born into the Ani- waya(Wolf) clan, the one associated in particular with bearing numerous warriors. By his thirties, he had assumed the warrior rank of Utsidihi (Mankiller), and the title of the Tassite of Great Tellico. He then rose to assume the higher Cherokee rank of Cherokee chief warrior or skiagusta, orator, and leading figure in diplomacy with British colonial authorities. The name Otacity He was often referred to among white colonists as Judd's Friend, referring to his relationship of a trader by that name After the Creek Indians seized an opportunity to lay Tellico under assault, in 1753 he moved to Tomotley. French and Indian War action During the French and Indian War, Ostenaco at first aided the Colony of Virginia against the French and the Shawnee, traveling over 3,500 miles on foot and by canoe. In 1756, he led 130 Cherokees in a joint Virginia-Cherokee campaign on the frontier of what is now West Virginia. In 1757 and 1758, his war party raided the French stronghold at Fort Duquesne (present day Pittsburgh). Timberlake Expedition=Background The expeditionary party comprising Lieutenant Henry Timberlake, Sergeant Thomas Sumter, John McCormack (an interpreter), and an unnamed servant, arrived in the Overhill town of Tomotley on December 20, where they were greeted by one of the leading men in the town, Ostenaco, who was visiting from Keowee. After spending several days in Tomotley as guests of Ostenaco, Timberlake and his interpreter proceeded to the Overhill mother town of Chota, where a number of chiefs had gathered in the town's large councilhouse. Ostenaco gave a speech and ceremonially buried a hatchet in the ground, symbolizing a state of peace between the English and the Cherokee. Afterward, Timberlake took part in a peace ceremony in which he smoked several ceremonial pipes with the gathered chiefs, a practice Timberlake personally found \\"very disagreeable,\\" but participated without openly complaining. Trip abroad Portrait of Ostenaco by Joshua Reynolds, 1762 On January 2, 1762, Timberlake returned to Tomotley with Ostenaco, his assignment largely completed. Timberlake spent the next few weeks studying Cherokee habits and making notes for his maps of the Overhill country. At the end of January, rumors began trickling in from Cherokee scouts of renewed hostilities with rival tribes to the north. Timberlake grew anxious and begged Ostenaco to guide him back to Virginia. Ostenaco reluctantly agreed, and the party set out on March 10, 1762. The party arrived in Williamsburg in early April. While in Williamsburg, Timberlake and Ostenaco attended a dinner party at William & Mary College at which Ostenaco professed his desire to meet the king of England. A young Thomas Jefferson, then a student at the college, later wrote of Ostenaco: > \\"I knew much of the great Outassete (Ostenaco), the warrior and orator of > the Cherokee. He was always the guest of my father on his journeys to and > from Williamsburg. I was in his camp when he made his great farewell oration > to his people the evening before he departed for England. The moon was in > full splendour, and to her he seemed to address himself in his prayers for > his own safety on the voyage and that of his people during his absence. His > sounding voice, distinct articulation, animated action, and the solemn > silence of his people at their several fires, filled me with awe and > veneration, although I did not understand a single word he uttered.\\" Drawing of Chief Ostenaco during his visit to London, 1762, by Joshua Reynolds In May 1762, Timberlake, Sumter, and three distinguished Cherokee leaders, including Ostenaco, departed for London. Arriving in early June, the Cherokee were an immediate attraction, drawing crowds all over the city. The poet Oliver Goldsmith queued for over three hours to meet the Cherokee, and offered him a gift. Ostenaco thanked him by kissing him on both cheeks, leaving them smeared with ochre, which caused bystanders to laugh, and discomforted Goldsmith, who didn't expect that 'natives' would apply makeup as heavy as that common in European society. It may have been Goldsmith who suggested to his friend Joshua Reynolds to paint Ostenaco's portrait. Reynolds was not satisfied with the result: he failed to find a solution to the need for harmonizing neoclassical principles about conveying something universal while catering to contemporary taste's interest in individualizing features. Thus he chose to ignore his subject's tattoos and ochre makeup, while depicting his wampum and hairstyle against a forested mountain backdrop. As a result he put the portrait, entitled 'Syacust Ukah', into storage. The Cherokees returned to North America with Thomas Sumter in August 1762, and the trip secured for Ostenaco lasting fame on both sides of the Atlantic. During the American Revolution During the Second Cherokee War (part of the American Revolution), Ostenaco was the chief war leader of the Cherokee Lower Towns in western South Carolina/northeast Georgia, and was allied with the British forces. In 1776 he led their attack against the Province of Georgia. After the destruction of the Lower Towns in the retaliation which followed, Ostenaco led his people west. The majority resettled in what is now far northern Georgia, with Ustanali as their chief town. Some followed him into the Cherokee–American wars with Dragging Canoe, and settled with him in the Chickamauga (now Chattanooga, Tennessee) region at the town of Ooltewah (Ultiwa'i, \\"owl's nest\\") on Ooltewah Creek (in the modern Hamilton County, Tennessee). Ostenaco died at the home of his grandson, Richard Timberlake, the son of Henry Timberlake and Ostenaco's daughter, at Ooltewah in 1780.

He was the first general manager in the history of the modern Baltimore Orioles, serving as their front-office boss during their return to the American League as the former St. Louis Browns in 1954. A former minor league player and a Baltimore native, Ehlers began his front office career as an executive with several minor league teams and circuits, including a stint as part-owner of the Reading, Pennsylvania, Chicks of the Class B Interstate League, president of the Interstate loop (1941–45) and promotions director of the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues. Executive with Philadelphia Athletics From to , Ehlers served as the farm system director of the Philadelphia Athletics. In September 1950, a tumultuous year for that franchise, Ehlers succeeded Baseball Hall of Fame catcher Mickey Cochrane as general manager of the Athletics upon an ownership reorganization involving two warring branches of the Connie Mack family. As a consequence of that restructuring, Cochrane, GM for only four months, stepped down; Connie Mack Jr. and his mother, the elder Mack's second wife, lost their bid for control of the franchise to Roy and Earle Mack, Connie Sr.'s children from his first marriage; and the elder Mack, 87 years of age and celebrating his 50th year at the helm of the A's, was forced into retirement.

Nuclides are composed of protons and neutrons. The shape of the valley refers to the profile of binding energy as a function of the numbers of neutrons and protons, with the lowest part of the valley corresponding to the region of most stable nuclei.The Valley of Stability (video) - a virtual \\"flight\\" through 3D representation of the nuclide chart, by CEA (France) The line of stable nuclides down the center of the valley of stability is known as the line of beta stability. The sides of the valley correspond to increasing instability to beta decay (β− or β+). The decay of a nuclide becomes more energetically favorable the further it is from the line of beta stability. The boundaries of the valley correspond to the nuclear drip lines, where nuclides become so unstable they emit single protons or single neutrons. Regions of instability within the valley at high atomic number also include radioactive decay by alpha radiation or spontaneous fission. The shape of the valley is roughly an elongated paraboloid corresponding to the nuclide binding energies as a function of neutron and atomic numbers. The nuclides within the valley of stability encompass the entire table of nuclides. The chart of those nuclides is known as a Segrè chart, after the physicist Emilio Segrè. The Segrè chart may be considered a map of the nuclear valley. The region of proton and neutron combinations outside of the valley of stability is referred to as the sea of instability. Scientists have long searched for long-lived heavy isotopes outside of the valley of stability, hypothesized by Glenn T. Seaborg in the late 1960s. These relatively stable nuclides are expected to have particular configurations of \\"magic\\" atomic and neutron numbers, and form a so-called island of stability. Description All atomic nuclei are composed of protons and neutrons bound together by the nuclear force. There are 286 primordial nuclides that occur naturally on earth, each corresponding to a unique number of protons, called the atomic number, Z, and a unique number of neutrons, called the neutron number, N. The mass number, A, of a nuclide is the sum of atomic and neutron numbers, A = Z + N. Not all nuclides are stable, however. According to Byrne, stable nuclides are defined as those having a half-life greater than 1018 years, and there are many combinations of protons and neutrons that form nuclides that are unstable. A common example of an unstable nuclide is carbon-14 that decays by beta decay into nitrogen-14 with a half-life of about 5,730 years : → + + In this form of decay, the original element becomes a new chemical element in a process known as nuclear transmutation and a beta particle and an electron antineutrino are emitted. An essential property of this and all nuclide decays is that the total energy of the decay product is less than that of the original nuclide. The difference between the initial and final nuclide binding energies is carried away by the kinetic energies of the decay products, often the beta particle and its associated neutrino. The concept of the valley of stability is a way of organizing all of the nuclides according to binding energy as a function of neutron and proton numbers. Most stable nuclides have roughly equal numbers of protons and neutrons, so the line for which Z = N forms a rough initial line defining stable nuclides. The greater the number of protons, the more neutrons are required to stabilize a nuclide, however, so nuclides with larger values for Z require an even larger number of neutrons, N > Z, to be stable. The valley of stability is formed by the negative of binding energy, the binding energy being the energy required to break apart the nuclide into its proton and neutron components. The stable nuclides have high binding energy, and these nuclides lie along the bottom of the valley of stability. Nuclides with weaker binding energy have combinations of N and Z that lie off of the line of stability and further up the sides of the valley of stability. Unstable nuclides can be formed in nuclear reactors or supernovas, for example. Such nuclides often decay in sequences of reactions called decay chains that take the resulting nuclides sequentially down the slopes of the valley of stability. The sequence of decays take nuclides toward greater binding energies, and the nuclides terminating the chain are stable. The valley of stability provides both a conceptual approach for how to organize the myriad stable and unstable nuclides into a coherent picture and an intuitive way to understand how and why sequences of radioactive decay occur. File:BindingNuDat2.pngChart of nuclides (isotopes) by binding energy, depicting the valley of stability. The diagonal line corresponds to equal numbers of neutrons and protons. Dark blue squares represent nuclides with the greatest binding energy, hence they correspond to the most stable nuclides. The binding energy is greatest along the floor of the valley of stability. File:HalflifeNuDat2.pngChart of nuclides by half life. Black squares represent nuclides with the longest half lives hence they correspond to the most stable nuclides. The most stable, long-lived nuclides lie along the floor of the valley of stability. Nuclides with more than 20 protons must have more neutrons than protons to be stable. File:DecayModeNuDat2.pngChart of nuclides by type of decay. Black squares are stable nuclides. Nuclides with excessive neutrons or protons are unstable to β− (light blue) or β+ (green) decay, respectively. At high atomic number, alpha emission (orange) or spontaneous fission (dark blue) become common decay modes. The role of neutrons The protons and neutrons that comprise an atomic nucleus behave almost identically within the nucleus. The approximate symmetry of isospin treats these particles as identical, but in a different quantum state. This symmetry is only approximate, however, and the nuclear force that binds nucleons together is a complicated function depending on nucleon type, spin state, electric charge, momentum, etc. and with contributions from non-central forces. The nuclear force is not a fundamental force of nature, but a consequence of the residual effects of the strong force that surround the nucleons. One consequence of these complications is that although deuterium, a bound state of a proton (p) and a neutron (n) is stable, exotic nuclides such as diproton or dineutron are unbound. The nuclear force is not sufficiently strong to form either p-p or n-n bound states, or equivalently, the nuclear force does not form a potential well deep enough to bind these identical nucleons. Stable nuclides require approximately equal numbers of protons and neutrons. The stable nuclide carbon-12 (12C) is composed of six neutrons and six protons, for example. Protons have a positive charge, hence within a nuclide with many protons there are large repulsive forces between protons arising from the Coulomb force. By acting to separate protons from one another, the neutrons within a nuclide play an essential role in stabilizing nuclides. With increasing atomic number, even greater numbers of neutrons are required to obtain stability. The heaviest stable element, lead (Pb), has many more neutrons than protons. The stable nuclide 206Pb has Z = 82 and N = 124, for example. For this reason, the valley of stability does not follow the line Z = N for A larger than 40 (Z = 20 is the element calcium). Neutron number increases along the line of beta stability at a faster rate than atomic number. The line of beta stability follows a particular curve of neutron–proton ratio, corresponding to the most stable nuclides. On one side of the valley of stability, this ratio is small, corresponding to an excess of protons over neutrons in the nuclides. These nuclides tend to be unstable to β+ decay or electron capture, since such decay converts a proton to a neutron. The decay serves to move the nuclides toward a more stable neutron-proton ratio. On the other side of the valley of stability, this ratio is large, corresponding to an excess of neutrons over protons in the nuclides. These nuclides tend to be unstable to β− decay, since such decay converts neutrons to protons. On this side of the valley of stability, β− decay also serves to move nuclides toward a more stable neutron- proton ratio. Neutrons, protons, and binding energy The mass of an atomic nucleus is given by :m = Z m_{p} + N m_{n} - \\\\frac{E_{B}}{c^{2}} where m_{p} and m_{n} are the rest mass of a proton and a neutron, respectively, and E_{B} is the total binding energy of the nucleus. The mass–energy equivalence is used here. The binding energy is subtracted from the sum of the proton and neutron masses because the mass of the nucleus is less than that sum. This property, called the mass defect, is necessary for a stable nucleus; within a nucleus, the nuclides are trapped by a potential well. A semi-empirical mass formula states that the binding energy will take the form :E_{B} = a_{V} A - a_{S} A^{2/3} - a_{C} \\\\frac{Z^2}{A^{1/3}} - a_{A} \\\\frac{(A - 2Z)^{2}}{A} \\\\pm \\\\delta(A,Z) The difference between the mass of a nucleus and the sum of the masses of the neutrons and protons that comprise it is known as the mass defect. EB is often divided by the mass number to obtain binding energy per nucleon for comparisons of binding energies between nuclides. Each of the terms in this formula has a theoretical basis. The coefficients a_{V}, a_{S}, a_{C}, a_{A} and a coefficient that appears in the formula for \\\\delta(A,Z) are determined empirically. The binding energy expression gives a quantitative estimate for the neutron-proton ratio. The energy is a quadratic expression in that is minimized when the neutron-proton ratio is N/Z \\\\approx 1 + \\\\frac{a_C}{2a_A} A^{2/3} . This equation for the neutron-proton ratio shows that in stable nuclides the number of neutrons is greater than the number of protons by a factor that scales as A^{2/3}. The negative of binding energy per nucleon for the stable nuclides located along the bottom of the valley of stability. Iron-56 is about the most stable nuclide, and it is about the lowest point within the valley of stability. The figure at right shows the average binding energy per nucleon as a function of atomic mass number along the line of beta stability, that is, along the bottom of the valley of stability. For very small atomic mass number (H, He, Li), binding energy per nucleon is small, and this energy increases rapidly with atomic mass number. Nickel-62 (28 protons, 34 neutrons) has the highest mean binding energy of all nuclides, while iron-58 (26 protons, 32 neutrons) and iron-56 (26 protons, 30 neutrons) are a close second and third. These nuclides lie at the very bottom of the valley of stability. From this bottom, the average binding energy per nucleon slowly decreases with increasing atomic mass number. The heavy nuclide 238U is not stable, but is slow to decay with a half-life of 4.5 billion years. It has relatively small binding energy per nucleon. For β− decay, nuclear reactions have the generic form : → + + where and are the mass number and atomic number of the decaying nucleus, and X and X′ are the initial and final nuclides, respectively. For β+ decay, the generic form is : → + + These reactions correspond to the decay of a neutron to a proton, or the decay of a proton to a neutron, within the nucleus, respectively. These reactions begin on one side or the other of the valley of stability, and the directions of the reactions are to move the initial nuclides down the valley walls towards a region of greater stability, that is, toward greater binding energy. Tellurium-52 (52Te) is stable, while antimony-51 (51Sb) is unstable to β− decay. The figure at right shows the average binding energy per nucleon across the valley of stability for nuclides with mass number A = 125. At the bottom of this curve is tellurium (52Te), which is stable. Nuclides to the left of 52Te are unstable with an excess of neutrons, while those on the right are unstable with an excess of protons. A nuclide on the left therefore undergoes β− decay, which converts a neutron to a proton, hence shifts the nuclide to the right and toward greater stability. A nuclide on the right similarly undergoes β+ decay, which shifts the nuclide to the left and toward greater stability. Heavy nuclides are susceptible to α decay, and these nuclear reactions have the generic form, : → + As in β decay, the decay product X′ has greater binding energy and it is closer to the middle of the valley of stability. The α particle carries away two neutrons and two protons, leaving a lighter nuclide. Since heavy nuclides have many more neutrons than protons, α decay increases a nuclide's neutron-proton ratio. Proton and neutron drip lines The boundaries of the valley of stability, that is, the upper limits of the valley walls, are the neutron drip line on the neutron- rich side, and the proton drip line on the proton-rich side. The nucleon drip lines are at the extremes of the neutron-proton ratio. At neutron–proton ratios beyond the drip lines, no nuclei can exist. The location of the neutron drip line is not well known for most of the Segrè chart, whereas the proton and alpha drip lines have been measured for a wide range of elements. Drip lines are defined for protons, neutrons, and alpha particles, and these all play important roles in nuclear physics. The difference in binding energy between neighboring nuclides increases as the sides of the valley of stability are ascended, and correspondingly the nuclide half-lives decrease, as indicated in the figure above. If one were to add nucleons one at a time to a given nuclide, the process will eventually lead to a newly formed nuclide that is so unstable that it promptly decays by emitting a proton (or neutron). Colloquially speaking, the nucleon has 'leaked' or 'dripped' out of the nucleus, hence giving rise to the term \\"drip line\\". Proton emission is not seen in naturally occurring nuclides. Proton emitters can be produced via nuclear reactions, usually utilizing linear particle accelerators (linac). Although prompt (i.e. not beta-delayed) proton emission was observed from an isomer in cobalt-53 as early as 1969, no other proton-emitting states were found until 1981, when the proton radioactive ground states of lutetium-151 and thulium-147 were observed at experiments at the GSI in West Germany. Research in the field flourished after this breakthrough, and to date more than 25 nuclides have been found to exhibit proton emission. The study of proton emission has aided the understanding of nuclear deformation, masses and structure, and it is an example of quantum tunneling. Two examples of nuclides that emit neutrons are beryllium-13 (mean life ) and helium-5 (). Since only a neutron is lost in this process, the atom does not gain or lose any protons, and so it does not become an atom of a different element. Instead, the atom will become a new isotope of the original element, such as beryllium-13 becoming beryllium-12 after emitting one of its neutrons. In nuclear engineering, a prompt neutron is a neutron immediately emitted by a nuclear fission event. Prompt neutrons emerge from the fission of an unstable fissionable or fissile heavy nucleus almost instantaneously. Delayed neutron decay can occur within the same context, emitted after beta decay of one of the fission products. Delayed neutron decay can occur at times from a few milliseconds to a few minutes. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission defines a prompt neutron as a neutron emerging from fission within 10−14 seconds. Island of stability The island of stability is a region outside the valley of stability where it is predicted that a set of heavy isotopes with near magic numbers of protons and neutrons will locally reverse the trend of decreasing stability in elements heavier than uranium. The hypothesis for the island of stability is based upon the nuclear shell model, which implies that the atomic nucleus is built up in \\"shells\\" in a manner similar to the structure of the much larger electron shells in atoms. In both cases, shells are just groups of quantum energy levels that are relatively close to each other. Energy levels from quantum states in two different shells will be separated by a relatively large energy gap. So when the number of neutrons and protons completely fills the energy levels of a given shell in the nucleus, the binding energy per nucleon will reach a local maximum and thus that particular configuration will have a longer lifetime than nearby isotopes that do not possess filled shells. A filled shell would have \\"magic numbers\\" of neutrons and protons. One possible magic number of neutrons for spherical nuclei is 184, and some possible matching proton numbers are 114, 120 and 126. These configurations imply that the most stable spherical isotopes would be flerovium-298, unbinilium-304 and unbihexium-310. Of particular note is 298Fl, which would be \\"doubly magic\\" (both its proton number of 114 and neutron number of 184 are thought to be magic). This doubly magic configuration is the most likely to have a very long half-life. The next lighter doubly magic spherical nucleus is lead-208, the heaviest known stable nucleus and most stable heavy metal. Discussion The valley of stability can be helpful in interpreting and understanding properties of nuclear decay processes such as decay chains and nuclear fission. The uranium-238 series is a series of α (N and Z less 2) and β− decays (N less 1, Z plus 1) to nuclides that are successively deeper into the valley of stability. The series terminates at lead-206, a stable nuclide at the bottom of the valley of stability. Radioactive decay often proceeds via a sequence of steps known as a decay chain. For example, 238U decays to 234Th which decays to 234mPa and so on, eventually reaching 206Pb: :\\\\begin{array}{l}{}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\ce{^{238}_{92}U->[\\\\alpha][4.5 \\\\times 10^9 \\\\ \\\\ce y] {^{234}_{90}Th} ->[\\\\beta^-][24 \\\\ \\\\ce d] {^{234\\\\\\\\!m}_{91}Pa}} \\\\ce{->[\\\\beta^-][1 \\\\ \\\\ce{min}]} \\\\ce{^{234}_{92}U ->[\\\\alpha][2.4 \\\\times 10^5 \\\\ \\\\ce y] {^{230}_{90}Th} ->[\\\\alpha][7.7 \\\\times 10^4 \\\\ \\\\ce y] } \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\ce{^{226}_{88}Ra ->[\\\\alpha][1600 \\\\ y] {^{222}_{86}Rn} ->[\\\\alpha][3.8 \\\\ \\\\ce d] {^{218}_{84}Po} ->[\\\\alpha][3 \\\\ \\\\ce{min}] {^{214}_{82}Pb} ->[\\\\beta^-][27 \\\\ \\\\ce{min}] {^{214}_{83}Bi} ->[\\\\beta^-][20 \\\\ \\\\ce{min}]} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\ce{^{214}_{84}Po ->[\\\\alpha][164 \\\\ \\\\mu\\\\ce{s}] {^{210}_{82}Pb} ->[\\\\beta^-][22 \\\\ \\\\ce y] {^{210}_{83}Bi} ->[\\\\beta^-][5 \\\\ \\\\ce d] {^{210}_{84}Po} ->[\\\\alpha][138 \\\\ \\\\ce d] {^{206}_{82}Pb}}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\{} \\\\end{array} With each step of this sequence of reactions, energy is released and the decay products move further down the valley of stability towards the line of beta stability. 206Pb is stable and lies on the line of beta stability. Nuclear fission seen with a uranium-235 nucleus The fission processes that occur within nuclear reactors are accompanied by the release of neutrons that sustain the chain reaction. Fission occurs when a heavy nuclide such as uranium-235 absorbs a neutron and breaks into lighter components such as barium or krypton, usually with the release of additional neutrons. Like all nuclides with a high atomic number, these uranium nuclei require many neutrons to bolster their stability, so they have a large neutron-proton ratio (N/Z). The nuclei resulting from a fission (fission products) inherit a similar N/Z, but have atomic numbers that are approximately half that of uranium. Isotopes with the atomic number of the fission products and an N/Z near that of uranium or other fissionable nuclei have too many neutrons to be stable; this neutron excess is why multiple free neutrons but no free protons are usually emitted in the fission process, and it is also why many fission product nuclei undergo a long chain of β− decays, each of which converts a nucleus N/Z to (N − 1)/(Z + 1), where N and Z are, respectively, the numbers of neutrons and protons contained in the nucleus. When fission reactions are sustained at a given rate, such as in a liquid-cooled or solid fuel nuclear reactor, the nuclear fuel in the system produces many antineutrinos for each fission that has occurred. These antineutrinos come from the decay of fission products that, as their nuclei progress down a β− decay chain toward the valley of stability, emit an antineutrino along with each β− particle. In 1956, Reines and Cowan exploited the (anticipated) intense flux of antineutrinos from a nuclear reactor in the design of an experiment to detect and confirm the existence of these elusive particles.

He was identified as the 24th most influential skateboarder of all time by TransWorld SKATEboarding magazine in 2011. The feature documentary Pray for Me: The Jason Jessee Film was released in 2007. Skateboarding Jessee's first sponsor was Powell Peralta and later Vision Street Wear, but made the move to a professional sponsorship deal with Santa Cruz Skateboards in December 1987. He notably featured in the company's 1988 highlight video Streets on Fire, in which he played a fictional version of himself who is arrested and jailed for illegal skateboarding. After an extended period of absence from the skateboarding industry, Jessee was once again sponsored by Santa Cruz and he helped the company during its 40th- anniversary celebration in 2013. In June 2012, Converse Skateboarding posted a short video on its YouTube channel welcoming Jessee as a company ambassador, which was shot at Jessee's rural California home and featured footage of his motorcycle riding and skateboarding. Jessee appeared in the 2018 film Converse PURPLE, but was then \\"indefinitely suspended\\" by Converse in May 2018 — during which he also made his first Thrasher magazine cover appearance — after details of his controversial past surfaced. Alongside other professional skateboarders such as Tony Hawk and Kevin Staab, Jessee was interviewed for the 2002 feature documentary Stoked: The Rise and Fall of Gator, about the tragedy of former professional skateboarder Mark \\"Gator\\" Rogowski. Jessee later described Rogowski in a June 2014 interview as a \\"creep\\". Other ventures Jessee has additionally worked as a custom-car and motorcycle builder, and was briefly a member of Los Angeles-based lowrider car club Dukes.  Controversy  Jessee came under controversy in May 2018 when a thread on an online forum hosted by Slap magazine alleged his past usage of racial slurs, hate speech, and Nazi imagery. The thread was later deleted but Vice published an article that month about the allegations, including details of a brawl at a skateboarding contest in 1986 between Jessee and African- American skateboarder Ned \\"Peanut\\" Brown, during which Jessee had reportedly called Brown \\"nigger\\". Jessee consequently lost all of his endorsements, including that with NHS, the parental company of Santa Cruz Skateboards. Legal issues On January 4, 2006, Jessee was removed from a flight and arrested at San Jose International Airport after passengers aboard the flight reported him writing in a journal that had the words \\"suicide bomber\\" written on the cover, in addition to his \\"acting bizarrely\\" and \\"clutching his backpack\\". He was arrested in April 2019 in Watsonville, California for possession of a stolen vehicle and an unregistered and illegally-configured assault rifle.

Elected office From 1993 to 1999, she was a member of the Michigan House of Representatives from the 104th District. McManus unsuccessfully ran for Congress in 1998 against then- Democratic incumbent Bart Stupak in Michigan's First Congressional District receiving only 40% of the vote. She served as the director of Governor John Engler's Northern Michigan Office between 1999 and 2002. In the 2002 general election McManus was elected to the Michigan Senate from the 35th Senate District. The district covered eleven counties, including Benzie, Clare, Kalkaska, Lake, Leelanau, Manistee, Mecosta, Missaukee, Osceola, Roscommon and Wexford. Her uncle, George A. McManus, Jr., had previously held the Senate seat for the 35th District. In 2003 as a State Senator, McManus introduced Senate Bill Nos. 395,Senator McManus was lead legislator on the bill, which was introduced by her and nineteen other senators. which would have made partial birth abortion illegal in the State of Michigan. The bill passed both houses and was enrolled as the \\"Legal Birth Definition Act\\". After the bill was vetoed by Governor Jennifer Granholm, Republicans decided to use the initiative petition system provided by the constitution,Michigan Constitution (1963), article 2, § 9 rather than attempt to override the governor's veto in the legislature. McManus joined with the Right to Life of Michigan, collected almost half-a-million signatures, and the new \\"Legal Birth Definition Act\\" was again passed by a majority of both houses, and became law in June 2004. However, it was subsequently found to be unconstitutional. As a member in the Michigan Legislative Sportsmen Caucus, she sponsored bills that created an apprentice hunting programs. She also was involved in a legislative attempt to ban internet hunting, which is a remote controlled version of hunting in which a person controls a gun over the internet with their mouse. McManus was elected to a second term in 2007, but left the Senate in 2010 due to term limits and was succeeded in the Michigan Senate by Darwin Booher. In 2010 McManus sought the Republican nomination for secretary of state, but lost at the Republican Convention to Ruth Johnson, the Oakland County Clerk.

Looney Tunes cartoon directed by Robert McKimson, and written by Tedd Pierce. The cartoon was released on December 22, 1951, and stars Daffy Duck and Porky Pig. Plot After listening to one of his favorite radio programs, Porky Pig receives a grand prize from the station. Out of the gift box pops Daffy Duck, who insists on living in Porky's house. After numerous attempts to throw Daffy out of the house, Daffy devises a plan to stay. He tells Porky that he has a split personality (á la The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde). When people treat him with kindness, he becomes sweet and cuddly, whereas when treated badly, he turns into a hideous monster, which he does by messing his hair up and putting in fangs. Getting the idea, Porky promises to be nice to Daffy who then begins to treat him like a servant. Porky then intends to call the authorities about Daffy without him knowing, only to be outsmarted by Daffy who impersonates the phone. Daffy puts up his monster guise on and chases Porky around the house. When Porky realizes he's been had (after coming out scared from a closet with a skeleton in it, presumably put in there by Daffy), he decides to outsmart this psychotic duck and get him out of the house by dressing up as a monster. When Daffy sees the monster (\\"Sufferin' catfish, I never realized I was THAT hideous. I'M NOT!\\"), he becomes so scared, he falls apart (literally) and runs out of the house screaming (putting himself back in the gift box in the process). When Porky accidentally sees himself in the mirror in his monster costume (which he stated that only a craven little coward would be scared of), he scares himself so much that he jumps onto a chandelier (\\"So I'm a craven little coward\\"). Aftermath *The Prize Pest is considered by some to be one of the last screwball Daffy Duck cartoons, as all of the directors eventually stuck with the greedy, self-centered Daffy that emerged in Rabbit Fire (1951). *The cartoon was incerpted in the 1988 compilation film Daffy Duck's Quackbusters in which Daffy hired Porky in his \\"Paranormalist at Large\\" company.

The entire length of the Rawa is within the Upper Silesian Metropolitan Union. It has its source in Ruda Śląska and crosses the cities of Świętochłowice, Chorzów and Katowice. Finally in Sosnowiec it joins the Brynica River only several hundred metres before the latter joins with Czarna Przemsza. The Rawa has lost most of its natural river character, and is now mostly a sewage channel flowing underground. Works have begun in order to restore it back to an ecologically sound water flow. Green Determination of the Silesia Region  Characteristics  The river has a source in the Marcin pond in Ruda Śląska. It flows through Świętochłowice, Chorzów, Katowice, Mysłowice and finally Sosnowiec where it joins Brynica just before the latter joins with Czarna Przemsza. During much of its route it flows underground, beneath the city's infrastructure. It is filled by rain, as well as sewage. It has several small confluences, such as Potok Leśny (near University of Economics in Katowice).  Pollution  The river is notorious for being heavily polluted. Reported to be crystal clear in 1875, the industrialization of Silesia caused the river to become so polluted that all the fish died out by 1893. The continued growth of industry and cities throughout the 20th century, combined with little effort towards preserving the environment, continued to degrade the quality of the water in the river. In 1992, the river, leaving Katowice, was claimed to contain only 14% water,Poland Waste Imports and a popular joke among the local citizens was to warn each other 'not to throw a lit match into the river'. Currently the upper part of the river is officially classified as sewage and the plan is to direct the entire river flow through a treatment plant.oczyszczalnia scieków klimzowiec In the 1990s plans to improve water quality and restore the ecology of the river were begun. So far new sewage treatment plants have been completed, and the plan is supposed to significantly improve the river's quality by 2010. Regulation of flow The primary reason for the regulation of the Rava's flow was the need to prevent flooding as mining continued to lower the level of local lands. The first plans for controlling the flow date to 1863. Plans to regulate the entire length of the Rawa were ready in 1903. The start of the First World War interrupted Prussian government implementation. After the war, the German plans were continued by the government of the Second Polish Republic in the late 1920s, with the construction of a sewage treatment plant (no longer existing). The work was completed in 1938, but the correct flow conditions did not last because of the continued lowering of the land. The second regulation of the river was conducted between 1975 and 1993. Name Sources first mention the river in 1737, as Róździanka - from an old village of Roździeń, now part of Katowice's district of Szopienice. The etymology of the name \\"Rawa\\" (Rava) is ancient. The name is related to Indo-European etymological dictionary Protoindoeuropean: *er[e](w)-, *rē(w)- (meaning quiet); Germanic: *rḗw-ō, *rṓw-ō, *rōw-a- (Old English: rōw, -e \`quiet, rest'; Middle Dutch: rouwe, rowe; Middle Low German: rouwe, rōwe; rāwe; Old High German: ruowa (AD 800), rāwa (9th century); Middle High German: ruowe, ruo, rāwe, rouwe, German Ruhe).

Beside the camps created during World War I to intern German, Austrian and Ottoman civilian prisoners, the Third Republic (1871–1940) opened various internment camps for the Spanish refugees fleeing the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939). Following the prohibition of the French Communist Party (PCF) by the government of Édouard Daladier, they were used to detain communist political prisoners. The Third Republic also interned German anti-Nazis (mostly members of the Communist Party of Germany, KPD). Then, after the 10 July 1940 vote of full powers to Marshal Philippe Pétain and the proclamation of the État français (Vichy regime), these camps were used to intern Jews, Gypsies, and various political prisoners (anti-fascists from all countries). Vichy opened up so many camps that it became a full economic sector, to the extent that historian Maurice Rajsfus writes: \\"The quick opening of new camps created jobs, and the Gendarmerie never ceased to hire during this period.\\"Maurice Rajsfus, Drancy, un camp de concentration très ordinaire, Cherche Midi éditeur (2005). In any case, most of these camps were closed definitively after the liberation of France at the end of World War II. Some were however used during the Algerian War (1954–1962). Several of these were then used to intern harkis (Algerians who had fought on the French side) after the 19 March 1962 Évian Accords. Finally, the Camp de Rivesaltes in the Pyrénées-Orientales and the camp of Bourg-Lastic in the Puy de Dôme were also used to intern Kurdish refugees from Iraq in the 1980s. Nineteenth century onwardFirst World War and later The first internment camps were opened during the First World War (1914–1918) to detain civilian prisoners (mainly German, Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman). These prisoners were detained in Pontmain in the department of Mayenne, Fort-Barreaux in Isère, in the military camp of Graveson (Bouches-du-Rhône), in Frigolet near Tarascon (Bouches-du- Rhône), Noirlac (Abbey) (Cher), and Ajain(Creuse). Other internment camps were used for Armenians in the 1920s-1930s (Mirabeau camp, Victor Hugo camp and Oddo Camp in Marseille); Gypsies after the 1912 Act on nomadism (for instance in the Royal Saltworks at Arc-et-Senans, but also in iron mines in the Manche and other disaffected industrial centers in Mayenne, in the Manche, in Loire- Atlantique, in the Sarthe, in the Maine-et-Loire, etc.).  Spanish Civil War  Commemorative stele for survivors of the retirada at Camp de Rivesaltes. The most infamous internment camps before World War II were used to intern the Spanish Republican refugees and military personnel during the Spanish Civil War.Hugh Thomas, (1976). Historia de la Guerra Civil Española. Barcelona: Círculo de Lectores. ; p. 943 In 2 weeks in January and February 1939 around 500,000 men, women and children crossed the border.Franco refugees still haunted by the past: ‘We were cold, hungry and scared’ The Guardian, 2019 These were interned mostly in camps in the Roussillon Province, such as the Camp de concentration d'Argelès-sur-Mer although internment camps for defeated Spanish Republicans were established in all of French territory, even in Brittany, in the north-west of France. These camps were located in: *Agde in the Hérault department (near Montpellier) *Argelès-sur-Mer, between Perpignan and the border *Camp Gurs in the Pyrénées-Atlantiques, which received Spanish refugees following the defeat of the Spanish Republic. These were distinguished by the French state into Brigadists, gudaris (Basque nationalists) who had escaped from the siege of Santander, pilots, and farmers. The latter had trades that were in low demand, and the French government, in agreement with the Francoist government, incited them to return to Spain. The great majority did so and were turned over to the Francoist authorities in Irún. From there they were transferred to the Miranda de Ebro camp for purification according to the Law of Political Responsibilities. *Camp Vernet near Pamiers, in the Ariège. *Moisdon-la-Rivière and Juigné-des- Moutiers in Loire-Atlantique department (Brittany).Moisdon-la-Rivière - Les Espagnols Internés à Moisdon-la-Rivière and Le Camp de La Forge in Moisdon-la- Rivière * The Camp de Rivesaltes, in the department of Pyrénées-Orientales. The Jewish detainees were sent to Drancy internment camp, near Paris, the Gypsies to Saliers and the Spaniards to camp Gurs. To these camps must be added the camps for the German prisoners in 1939 (sometimes overlapping with those above), and those of the Colonial Empire, not well known in Europe. Furthermore, the Chilean poet Pablo Neruda, who had been named Consul in Paris for Immigration, organized the transportation to Chile of 2,200 Spanish refugees who had been detained in the camps on board the Winnipeg, which departed on 2 August 1939, and arrived in Valparaíso at the beginning of September 1939. After 1940 when the Nazi Germany divided France in occupied and free zone, the camps were also used to imprison Jews, Gypsies, and sometimes gays, and the original prisoners were used as forced labor to make the camps larger.

The Vichy government would progressively hand them up to the Gestapo, and they would all transit by Drancy internment camp, the last stop before concentration camps in the Third Reich and in Eastern Europe and the extermination camps. Beside Jews, Germans and Austrians were immediately rounded-up in camps, as well as Spanish refugees, who were later deported. 5,000 Spaniards thus died in Mauthausen concentration camp.Film documentary on the website of the Cité nationale de l'histoire de l'immigration The French colonial soldiers were interned by the Germans on French territory, instead of being deported. The Third Republic and the Vichy regime would successively call these places \\"reception camps\\" (), \\"internment camps\\" (), séjour camps (), \\"guarded séjour camps\\" (), \\"prisoner camps\\" (), etc. Another category was created by the Vichy regime: the \\"transit camps\\" (\\"camps de transit\\"), referring to the fact the detainees were to be deported to Germany. Such \\"transit camps\\" included Drancy, Pithiviers, etc. In particular, Pithiviers was used in 1941 for the green ticket roundup, and Drancy in 1942 for the Vel' d'Hiv Roundup, before the victims were deported., as quoted in During the 1943 Battle of Marseille and urban in the center of town, 20,000 people were expelled from their homes and interned during several months in military camps nearby Fréjus (La Lègue, Caïs and Puget). The camp of Struthof, or Natzweiler- Struthof, in Alsace, one of the concentration camps created by Nazis on annexed French territory, included a gas chamber which was used to kill at least 86 detainees (mostly Jewish) with the aim of forming a collection of preserved skeletons for the use of Nazi professor August Hirt. Second World War camps * Aincourt, in Seine-et-Oise, was the first internment camp in the Northern Zone. It was opened on 5 October 1940, and quickly filled with members of the French Communist Party (PCF) * Les Alliers, near Angoulême, in Charente * Royal Saltworks at Arc-et-Senans (Saline royale d'Arc-et-Senans) in the Doubs, used for Gypsies * Avrillé-les-Ponceaux in Indre-et-Loire, camp of the Morellerie for Gypsies * Le Barcarès in the Roussillon * Beaune-la-Rolande internment camp at Beaune-la-Rolande in the Loiret * Bourg-Lastic in the Puy de Dôme, a former military camp where Jews were detained (André Glucksmann was detained there during four years). The camp was used to intern Harkis in the 1960s and Kurdish refugees from Iraq in the 1980s (see below). * Bram in the Aude (1939–1940) * Brens in the Tarn, near Gaillac (1939–1940) * Choiseul, in Chateaubriant in Brittany, in Loire-Atlantique (1941–1942) * Camp of Royallieu in Compiègne, Picardy (June 1941 to August 1944). It was used to intern the Jewish detainees arrested during the January 1943 Battle of Marseille. Robert Desnos (1900–1945) and the famous French Resistance member Jean Moulin (1899–1943) transited through this camp. * Coudrecieux in the Sarthe, was used to intern Romanis. * Douadic in the Indre department * Drancy internment camp: On 20 August 1941, French police conducted raids throughout the 11th arrondissement (district) of Paris and arrested more than 4,000 Jews, mainly foreign or stateless Jews. French authorities interned these Jews in Drancy, marking its official opening. French police enclosed a police barrack with barbed-wire fencing and provided Gendarmerie to guard the camp. Drancy fell under the command of the Gestapo Office of Jewish Affairs in France and German SS Captain Theodor Dannecker. Five subcamps of Drancy were located throughout Paris (three of which were the Austerlitz, Lévitan and Bassano camps)United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. \\"Drancy\\" article for the Holocaust Encyclopedia (accessed 5 July 2009). * Fort-Barraux in the department of Isère. It had already been used as a prison during the French Revolution; Antoine Barnave was imprisoned there. * Gurs internment camp in the Pyrénées- Atlantiques, created in 1939 for the Spanish refugees. During the Phony War, the Third Republic used it to intern \\"indésirables\\", that is Germans who were found in France, without regard to ethnicity or political orientation, as foreign citizens of an enemy power. Among them stands out a significant number of German Jews who had fled the very Nazi regime; citizens of countries who were in the orbit of the Reich, like Austria, Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, Slovak Republic, Fascist Italy, or Poland; French activists of the left (trade unionists, socialists, anarchists, and especially, communists), following the proscription of the Parti Communiste Français (PCF) by Daladier after the German–Soviet Non-aggression Pact; the first of these arrived 21 June 1940, and the majority were relocated in other camps before the end of the year. In Gurs were also interned during this period: anti-militarists, representatives of the French extreme right who sympathized with the Nazi regime, ordinary prisoners evacuated from prisons in the north of the country ahead of the German advance, common criminals awaiting trial. Then, under Vichy, Camp Gurs was used to detain foreign Jews, German Jews deported by the SS from southern Germany, persons who had illegally crossed the border of the zone occupied by the Germans, Spaniards fleeing Francoist Spain, Spaniards coming from other camps that had been condemned for being uninhabitable or due to their scarce contingent, stateless persons, people involved in prostitution, homosexuals, Romani people and indigents. * Jargeau, near Orléans, used for the internment of Romani people * Lalande in the Yonne, * Linas-Montlhéry in the Seine-et-Oise for Romani people * Marolles in the Loir- et-Cher * Masseube in the Gers * Les Mazures in the Ardennes department, where a Judenlager was opened from July 1942 to January 1944 * Mérignac in the Gironde. This is where Maurice Papon had Jews of the Bordeaux region interned before going to Drancy. Among others, Robert Aron was detained there. * Meslay-du-Maine, in Mayenne department (1939–1940) Leon Askin held here 1939} * Camp des Milles near Aix-en-Provence in the Bouches-du-Rhône, which was the largest internment camp in the southeast of France. 2,500 Jews were deported from there following the August 1942 raids. Novelist Lion Feuchtwanger, Surrealist artists Hans Bellmer and Max Ernst were among the most famous inmates detained in this concentration camp. * Montceau-les-Mines * Natzweiler-Struthof a German-run concentration camp located in the Vosges Mountains close to the Alsatian village of Natzwiller (German Natzweiler) * Nexon in the Haute-Vienne * Noé - Mauzac in the Haute-Garonne * Montreuil- Bellay in the Maine-et-Loire, created to intern Romani people * Les Tourelles in Paris * Pithiviers transit camp in Pithiviers. Jewish novelist Irène Némirovsky (1903–1942) was interned there. * Poitiers in the Vienne department to intern Romani people * Port-Louis, in Morbihan, in the fort * Recebedou, in Haute-Garonne, in the suburbs of Toulouse * Camp of Rieucros in Lozère (the mathematician Alexander Grothendieck was interned there) * The Camp de Rivesaltes, in the Pyrénées Orientales, \\"The Drancy of the zone sud\\"; * Fort de Romainville (\\"Fort of Romainville\\"), was a Nazi prison, located in the outskirts of Paris. The Fort was invested in 1940 by the German military and transformed into a prison. From there, resistance members and hostages were directed to the Nazi concentration camps: 3,900 women and 3,100 men were interned before being deported to Auschwitz, Ravensbrück, Buchenwald and Dachau. 152 persons were executed by firing-squad in the Fort itself. A few escaped, such as Pierre Georges, alias \\"Colonel Fabien.\\" From her cell, Danielle Casanova, motivated and encouraged her comrades to confront their torturers. From October 1940, the Fort held only female prisoners (resistance members and hostages), who were jailed, executed or redirected to the Nazi concentration camps outside France. At the time of the Liberation in August 1944, many abandoned corpses were found in the Fort's yard. * Saint-Cyprien in the Pyrénées-Orientales. 90,000 Spanish refugees were interned there in March 1939, and it was officially closed on 19 December 1940 for \\"sanitary reasons\\", its occupants transferred to the Camp of Gurs. * Saint-Maurice-aux-Riches- Hommes in the Yonne, for Gypsies * Saint-Paul d'Eyjeaux in the Haute-Vienne * Saint-Sulpice-la-Pointe. Located near Toulouse, this transit camp was set up after the beginning of the Phony War. It was to house \\"individuals representing a danger to national security\\" - mostly militant communists. In June 1940, with the first German attacks on the Soviet Union, people with Russian citizenship were interned there. Later, foreign Jews who had been living in hiding in the south of France and were rounded up in the summer of 1942 were also sent to the camp. The inmates, especially the communists, organized many cultural activities, a \\"little university\\", in which each one contributed their knowledge for the collective good. From the summer of 1942 to the closing of the camp in August 1944, most of its inmates were deported to camps in Eastern Europe, to Auschwitz and Buchenwald.Saint-Sulpice-la- Pointe Camp (note confusion about dates concerning the Phony War) * Saliers concentration camp near Arles in the Bouches-du-Rhône, interned Romani people * Schirmeck in Alsace in the part not annexed by the Third Reich * Septfonds * Thil in Meurthe-et-Moselle * Le Vernet Internment Camp in the Ariège which concentrated 12,000 Spanish refugees as early as 1939. It was used later on for the internment of the harkis. * Vittel in the Vosges department, where US or British citizens were interned * Voves in the Eure-et-Loir * Woippy in the department of Moselle, created in 1943.  Camps under foreign authorities  The Nazis also opened Struthof in Alsace (in the part annexed by the Reich). The United States military police also possessed legal authority over the camp in Septèmes-les-Vallons, in the Bouches-du-Rhône.  Ilags  Ilag (for Internierunslager) were internment camps established by the German Army to hold Allied civilians, captured in areas that were occupied by the Germans. They included US citizens caught in Europe by surprise when the war was declared in December 1941 and citizens of the British Commonwealth caught in areas engulfed by the Blitzkrieg. * Besançon in the Doubs (in the Vauban barracks). Also called Frontstalag 142, it was actually an internment camp. At the end of 1940, 2,400 women, mostly British, were interned in the Vauban barracks and another five hundred, old and sick, in the St. Jacques hospital close by. In early 1941, many of them were released, the rest were transferred to Vittel. * Saint-Denis, near Paris. Located in the barracks, the camp was opened in June 1940 and remained in use until liberated by the United States Army in August 1944. Part of the grounds were surrounded by barbed wire to provide open space for exercise. In early 1942, there were more than 1,000 male British internees in the camp. The meagre food rations were augmented by the International Red Cross packages, so that overall their diet was satisfactory. Life was tolerable because there was a good library and recreation was provided by sports activities and theater *Vittel, Frontstalag 121 was located in requisitioned hotels in this spa near Epinal in the Vosges department. Most of the British families and single women were transferred here from Saint-Denis and Besançon. In early 1942, women over sixty, men over seventy-five and children under sixteen were released. The overall population was thus reduced to about 2,400. The inmates included a number of North- American families and women.  Colonial administration  Although not architecturally conceived as an internment camp, the Vel' d'Hiv (Winter Velodrome) was used during the July 1942 Roundup. Most internment camps, however, were not conceived as such. The Vel d'Hiv was also used during the Algerian War (see below). In the colonial empire, Vichy created in Algeria and in Morocco labour camps (\\"camps de travail\\") for Jews in: * Abadla, Algeria * Ain el Ourak * Bechar, Algeria * Berguent * Bogari * Bouarfa * Djefa * Kenadsa * Meridja * Missour, Morocco * Tendrara The liberation= German prisoners of war  Camps were also used after the liberation to intern German prisoners. In Rennes, after General Patton's United States Third Army liberated the city on 4 August 1944, about 50,000 German prisoners were kept in four camps in a city of 100,000 inhabitants at the time. In the Camp de Rivesaltes, the German prisoners worked extensively in the reconstruction of Pyrénées-Orientales, between May 1945 and 1946, 412 German prisoners of war died in the camp.  After World War II = Indochina war  Internment camps were used to receive French from Indochina following the end of the Indochina War in 1954, as well as approximatively 9,000 Hungarian refugees following the Budapest insurrection of 1956 (in Annecy, Colmar—Caserne Valter—, in Gap, in Le Havre, in Metz—Caserne Raffenel, in Montdauphin, in Montluçon—Caserne de Richemond—, in Nancy (camp de Chatelleraud), in Poitiers, in Rennes, in Rouen, in Strasbourg—caserne Stirn—and in Valdahon). Humanitarian concerns largely intertwined with repressive aims, and internment restrictions and assistance given to populations varied widely (Hungarian refugees were better treated than French from Indochina).  Algerian war  Internment was also put to use during the Algerian War (1954–1962), generally under the name of \\"camps de regroupement\\" (\\"regrouping camps\\"). Within Algeria, the colonial administration used a form of camps as a counter- insurgency tactic, with up to 2 million civilians being internally deported in villages de regroupement) to prevent their falling under the influence of the opposing FLN forces. were brought to French metropolitan territory. In France, some camps used under Vichy were opened again, in Paris in particular, to hold suspected FLN and other Algerian independentists.  The Harkis  Internment camps were also used to intern the Harkis (Algerians who fought on the French Army's side) after the 19 March 1962 Évian Accords which put an official end to the war. Finally, the Camp de Rivesaltes in the Pyrénées- Orientales, and Bourg-Lastic in the Puy de Dôme, used to intern Jews, were also used to intern Harkis in the 1960s, and Kurdish refugees from Iraq in the 1980s.

It opened Monday, October 19, 1896 (according to local papers), in Buffalo, New York.Ramsaye, Terry. A Million and One Nights: A History of the Motion Picture (Abingdon, UK: Frank Cass, 2012) [original edition: New York: Simon and Schuster, 1926] It operated nearly two years, the longest run for any such theater at that time: comparable early theaters were temporary and lasted only days or weeks. Mark was the first American to have a distribution arrangement with Pathé Frères to import Pathé films to the United States. Indeed, nearly the entire Vitascope Theatre program of October 19, 1896, consisted of Lumiere films. Expansion Again with his brother, Mitchel founded the Automatic Vaudeville Company in 1904 in New York City. Among their partners were Adolph Zukor (co-founder with Jesse Lasky of Paramount Pictures) and Marcus Loew (founder of Loew's Theatres). It was based in form on Edisonia Hall and the Vitascope Theatre in Buffalo.

History  Lafitte's Tavern on Tom Sawyer Island at Disneyland in 2007The area opened in 1956, one year after the opening of Disneyland Park. Prior to the debut of Fantasmic! in 1992, when the south end of the Island was re-built to facilitate the nighttime show, Tom Sawyer Island saw very little change. The Island received major upgrades, new show elements, and a complete re-theming in 2007 when it re-opened as Pirate's Lair on Tom Sawyer Island. The re-theming eradicated much of the previous Tom Sawyer theme in favor of characters and elements from and inspired by the Pirates of the Caribbean film series. A justification behind connecting the Tom Sawyer and pirate themes came in the form of a chapter from The Adventures of Tom Sawyer where Tom, Huck and Joe Harper go off to play pirates on a nearby island, the idea being that all of the Pirates of the Caribbean elements added to the island are all a part of their imaginative play. Pirate's Lair on Tom Sawyer Island's opening coincided with the theatrical release of Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End.\\"THE YEAR OF A MILLION DREAMS MEANS NEW FUN & ADVENTURES AT DISNEYLAND RESORT\\" . Disneyland Resort Newsroom. 27 January 2007. Retrieved on 20 February 2008. On January 11, 2016, Pirate's Lair on Tom Sawyer Island, along with the other attractions and shows along the Rivers of America, closed temporarily for the construction of Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge.http://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2015/09/season-of-the-force-begins- november-16-at-disneyland-park-in-southern-california/ Pirate's Lair on Tom Sawyer Island reopened on June 16, 2017. Geography and features Guests visit the island, surrounded by the Rivers of America, by traveling on a motorized raft which is piloted by a Disneyland cast member. While aboard the Sailing Ship Columbia or Mark Twain Riverboat, Disneyland guests travel clockwise around the island. Looking to starboard, they can see the many areas and adventure opportunities of the island. To port, they see Disneyland itself and from time to time will see a Disneyland Railroad train passing by. At the northern end of the island, inaccessible to guests, is the Burning Settler's Cabin, a cabin that used to actually burn by spewing fire from its roof. Despite guest complaints, the park no longer ignites the roof of the cabin with propane each time a watercraft passes by. The Walt Disney World version lasted until 2006, where the pipes (the originals from 1971) were damaged by age and being turned off while the Riverboat was under refurbishment. Over the years, there have been theme changes to the cabin itself: originally, it was said to have been set afire by a hostile native tribe. This storyline was eventually changed due to complaints from Native American guests, so it was said to have been the home of a moonshiner who had fallen into a drunken stupor when he should have been minding his still; later, after the live flames were eliminated, the fire was described (at least in the Mark Twain steamboat narration) as the result of unspecified carelessness, and as having left not only the cabin's owner homeless, but also some of the local wildlife. In 2007, the outward appearance of the house was cleaned up and all fire damage was removed, making it just another homestead along the waters. Currently, narration (and dialogue from the cabin itself) indicates that it is the home of Mike Fink, keelboater and self-proclaimed \\"King of the River.\\" When the island reopened in July 2017, the cabin was removed due to the shortening of the island for Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge. A new cabin that does not light on fire was built on the north-most tip of the shortened island as an homage to the original burning cabin. The most prominent structure on the island, viewable from Frontierland, Adventureland and New Orleans Square, is Lafitte's Tavern, which was formerly Harper's Mill. The Landing The Landing on the island consists of a small dock in which the Rafts to Tom Sawyer Island travel to from the mainland. Guests exit the raft here, and then guests waiting in the dock's small switchback queue enter the raft to travel back to the mainland. Lafitte's Tavern - Pirate Point 200px Lafitte's Tavern is the former Harper's Mill which has been part of Tom Sawyer Island since its inception. The outside walls and porch of Lafitte's Tavern features various swords and the salty pirates visiting this place are asked to stow their weapons outside. Despite the Explorer's Map's lively description of the place, Guests cannot actually enter the Tavern. There was small pirate stunt show that took place on the stage area in front of the Tavern, and between shows The Bilge Rats, a band of pirate musicians, entertained guests with lively sea chanteys. The Tavern actually houses a lot of show equipment and elements for the nighttime show, Fantasmic!. And beneath the ground that the tavern overlooks is a massive pit that houses the show animatronic Maleficent in her dragon form. W. Turner Blacksmith W. Turner Blacksmith features props and show elements reminiscent of the blacksmith shop from Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl in which the character of Will Turner is introduced. Dead Man's Grotto The Dead Man's Chest in Dead Man's Grotto, part of Pirate's Lair on Tom Sawyer Island Formerly Injun Joe's Cave (featuring a bridge over a bottomless pit along with wind and moan sounds), Dead Man's Grotto infuses more of the Pirates of the Caribbean film mythology into Tom Sawyer Island. The cave features several prominent interactive elements that feature state-of-the-art lighting and sound technology. The first thing guests will note is that Captain Jack Sparrow has left a note of caution for explorers above the entry. The first major interactive feature guests will encounter is the Chest of Davy Jones from the Pirates of the Caribbean films. Upon touching the chest, lighting will change, Davy Jones' disembodied voice will utter words of warning, and guests will be able to feel the heartbeat of Jones' heart from within the chest. Skeletons of previous explorers and pirates litter the pits of the cave, implying danger to those who continue to press onward. Additional features in the cave include \\"pop-up\\" gags featuring Pintel and Ragetti from the Pirates of the Caribbean films who are guarding cursed treasure as well as other effects featuring disappearing treasure and a genie in a bottle guarding treasure. The end of the Dead Man's Grotto cave features an Audio-Animatronics figure of a cursed pirate prisoner. The pirate's cursed state is in reference to the first Pirates film, but is not representative of any specific character or scene. The cursed pirate comes alive in seemingly random intervals, warning onlookers of the danger of the cursed treasure, asking for help, or sometimes dealing threats. A small, high- up window in the prisoner's cell will occasionally reveal a full moon through the clouds in a dark night sky, which transforms the prisoner into his cursed, undead form. Smuggler's Cove The Capstan Wheel Smuggler's Cove is a remnant of the original Tom Sawyer Island, however, has been changed dramatically for the Pirate's Lair makeover. The area now appears to be the site of the wreck of a small sailing vessel which was carrying much pirate loot. Smuggler's Cove features several interactive play features including: * The Capstan Wheel: When turned by guests, the capstan wheel hoists a treasure chest out of the watery wreckage, with the skeletal remains of a pirate still holding onto his beloved treasure. * Bilge Pumps: Bilge pumps allow guests to pump out some of the water from the flooded ship, revealing skeletons of long- dead pirates still guarding their treasure in their watery grave. * Bone Cage: The bone cage serves as a photo-op for guests and is a smaller replica of the bone cages featured in the Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest feature film. * Suspension Bridge: The suspension bridge is an element from the original Tom Sawyer Island, and crosses overhead, above the bilge pumps and bone cage feature. * Pontoon Bridge: Rocking and splashing in the water, the pontoon bridge crosses the water for daring explorers near the capstan wheel wreckage. Castle Rock Castle Rock is a large rock structure which features stationary telescopes, giving guests views of specific scenery and points of interest back on the Frontierland and Critter Country mainland. The area was mostly unchanged during the Pirate's Lair re-theme, and only features a couple of hidden pirate chests and themed barrels bearing the East India Trading Company stamp. Pirate's Den - Shipwreck That official description of the Shipwreck alludes to the Kraken creature featured in the Pirates of the Caribbean films. The shipwreck is a minor feature, only being a small walk-through feature with no interactive elements. Inside the Shipwreck, Davy Jones' ghostly voice can be heard whispering warnings to those who dare inspect the wreckage. The inside of the wreckage features more state-of-the- art LED lighting design, similar to what is seen on a larger scale in Dead Man's Grotto. The wreckage is littered with barnacles, a skeleton, weaponry, and other features from a pirate ship. The Captain's Treasure Captain Jack Sparrow with a park guest standing among the Captain's Treasure. The Captain's Treasure is a large mound of loot at the furthest end of the Island accessible to guests. The area is a photo-op in which guests can pose with the mound of treasure, and often Captain Jack Sparrow can be found posing for photos with guests. Tom & Huck's Tree House Tom and Huck's Tree House was the only major guest-accessible feature on the Island not to be notably featured on the Explorer's Map of Pirate's Lair on Tom Sawyer Island. The Tree House was a remnant of the original Tom Sawyer Island theme, and is arguably now irrelevant in regards to the Island's pirate theme, though it does play into the island's new backstory as being a backdrop for Tom and Huck's wildly imaginative pirate playtime. The Tree House was mostly unchanged during the Pirate's Lair re-theme, except for a couple of small pirate additions themed to appear as though Tom and Huck made them in the tree house. When the island reopened after its July 2017 refurbishment, the stairs up the tree house were removed and guests can no longer climb up the tree house. Fort Wilderness Fort Wilderness is an original 1956 feature of Tom Sawyer Island. Previously a guest-accessible feature of the island, Fort Wilderness was closed after the island re-opened from a refurbishment in 2003.Weiss, Werner. \\"Fort Wilderness At Yesterland\\". Yesterland. 18 May 2007. Retrieved on 20 February 2008. In 2007 Disney demolished the original 1956 Fort Wilderness due to long-neglected termite and weather damage. A new Fort Wilderness was constructed; however, instead of being constructed with authentic hand-hewn logs, it was built with standard milled lumber. The new Fort Wilderness is not accessible to guests. Tom Sawyer Islands in other Disney theme parks Magic Kingdom's Tom Sawyer Island The Magic Kingdom within Walt Disney World Resort in Florida and Tokyo Disneyland in Japan both have their own Tom Sawyer Island, still known by their original names. Disneyland Paris and Hong Kong Disneyland have islands, but with alternate themes. In Disneyland Paris, Big Thunder Mountain Railroad occupies the site while Hong Kong Disneyland has Tarzan's Treehouse, which is in Adventureland in a similar location.

When deployed properly and in combination with other permaculture principles, it can generate healthy, productive, and low maintenance ecosystems. Sheet mulching, also known as composting in place, mimics nature by breaking down organic material from the topmost layers down. The simplest form of sheet mulching consists of applying a bottom layer of decomposable material, such as cardboard or newspapers, to the ground to kill existing vegetation and suppress weeds. Then, a top layer of organic mulch is applied. More elaborate sheet mulching involves more layers. Sheet mulching is used to transform a variety of surfaces into a fertile soil that can be planted. Sheet mulching can be applied to a lawn, a dirt lot full of perennial weeds, an area with poor soil, or even pavement or a rooftop. Technique Typical layers of natural soil. A model for sheet mulching consists of the following steps: # The area of interest is flattened by trimming down existing plant species such as grasses. # The soil is analyzed and its pH is adjusted (if needed). # The soil is moisturized (if needed) to facilitate the activity of decomposers. # The soil is then covered with a thin layer of slowly decomposing material (known as the weed barrier), typically cardboard. This suppresses the weeds by blocking sunlight, adds nutrients to the soil as weed matter quickly decays beneath the barrier, and increases the mechanical stability of the growing medium. # A layer (around 10 cm thick) of weed-free soil, rich in nutrients is added, in an attempt to mimic the surface soil, or A horizon. # A layer (at most 15 cm thick) of weed-free, woody and leafy matter is added in an attempt to mimic the forest floor, or O horizon. Theoretically, the soil is now ready to receive the desirable plant seeds or transplants. Variations and considerations *Often the barrier is applied a few months before planting to ensure the penetration of roots of newly planted seeds. *Very thick barriers can cause anaerobic conditions. *Some permaculturists incorporate composting in steps 5 and/or 6. *Sheets of newspaper and clothing can be used instead of cardboard. *Before step 4, an initial layer (2–3 kg/m2) of matter rich in nutrients (such as compost or manure) may be added to bolster decomposition. *Some varieties of grasses and weeds may be beneficial in a number of ways. Such plants can be controlled and used rather than eradicated. See also: mulch, list of beneficial weeds. *One variation of mulching, called hugelkultur, involves using buried logs and branches as the first layer of the bed. Advantages Sheet mulch has important advantages relative to conventional methods, such as tilling, plowing or applying herbicides: *Improvement of desirable plants' health and productivity. *Retention of water and nutrients and stabilization of biochemical cycles. *Improvement of soil structure, soil life, and prevention of soil erosion. *Avoidance of potentially dangerous pesticides, especially herbicides. *Reduction of overall maintenance labor and costs. *Most of the materials required to sheet mulch can be collected at no cost, and materials can be substituted for those readily available in certain areas. For instance, suburban areas may have a plentiful supply of leaves, and farming communities may have spoiled hay and manure. Disadvantages *Some weed seeds (such as those of Bermuda grass and species of bindweed) may persist under the barrier and within the soil seed bank. * Termites are attracted to the area. While they are a natural part of the ecosystem that transforms the weed barrier into rich soil, they can pose a hazard to nearby wood-framed structures. *Slug populations may increase during the early stages of decomposition. However they can be kept away or harvested. *The system may need a constant supply of organic material, at least during the early stages. *Roaming animals may interrupt the sheet mulching process.

Taxonomy Cupriavidus necator has gone through a series of name changes. In the first half of the 20th century, many micro-organisms were isolated for their ability to use hydrogen. Hydrogen-metabolizing chemolithotrophic organisms were clustered into the group Hydrogenomonas. C. necator was originally named Hydrogenomonas eutrophus because it fell under the Hydrogenomonas classification and was “well nourished and robust”. Some of the original H. eutrophus cultures isolated were by Bovell and Wilde. After characterizing cell morphology, metabolism and GC content, the Hydrogenomonas nomenclature was disbanded because it comprised many species of microorganisms. H. eutrophus was then renamed Alcaligenes eutropha because it was a micro-organism with degenerated peritrichous flagellation. Investigating phenotype, lipid composition, fatty acid composition and 16S rRNA analysis, A. eutropha was found to belong to the genus Ralstonia and named Ralstonia eutropha. Upon further study of the genus, Ralstonia was found to comprise two phenotypically distinct clusters. The new genus Wautersia was created from one of these clusters which included R. eutropha. In turn R. eutropha was renamed Wautersia eutropha. Looking at DNA-DNA hybridization and phenotype comparison with Cupriavidus necator, W. eutropha was found to be the same species as previously described C. necator. Because C. necator was named in 1987 far before the name change to R. eutropha and W. eutropha, the name C. necator was assigned to R. eutropha according to Rule 23a of the International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria. Metabolism Cupriavidus necator is a hydrogen- oxidizing bacterium (“knallgas” bacterium) capable of growing at the interface of anaerobic and aerobic environments. It can easily adapt between heterotrophic and autotrophic lifestyles. Both organic compounds and hydrogen can be used as a source of energy C. necator can perform aerobic or anaerobic respiration by denitrification of nitrate and/or nitrite to nitrogen gas. When growing under autotrophic conditions, C. necator fixes carbon through the reductive pentose phosphate pathway. It is known to produce and sequester polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) plastics when exposed to excess amounts of sugar substrate. PHA can accumulate to levels around 90% of the cell's dry weight. To better characterize the lifestyle of C. necator, the genomes of two strains have been sequenced. Hydrogenases Cupriavidus necator can use hydrogen gas as a source of energy when growing under autotrophic conditions. It contains four different hydrogenases that have [Ni-Fe] active sites and all perform this reaction: :H2 \\\\rightleftharpoons 2H+ \\\\+ 2e− The hydrogenases of C. necator are like other typical [Ni-Fe] hydrogenases because they are made up of a large and a small subunit. The large subunit is where the [Ni-Fe] active site resides and the small subunit is composed of [Fe-S] clusters. However, the hydrogenases of C. necator are different from typical [Ni-Fe] hydrogenases because they are tolerant to oxygen and are not inhibited by CO. While the four hydrogenases perform the same reaction in the cell, each hydrogenase is linked to a different cellular process. The differences between the regulatory hydrogenase, membrane-bound hydrogenase, soluble hydrogenase and actinobacterial hydrogenase in C. necator are described below. Regulatory hydrogenase The first hydrogenase is a regulatory hydrogenase (RH) that signals to the cell hydrogen is present. The RH is a protein containing large and small [Ni-Fe] hydrogenase subunits attached to a histidine protein kinase subunit. The hydrogen gas is oxidized at the [Ni-Fe] center in the large subunit and in turn reduces the [Fe-S] clusters in the small subunit. It is unknown whether the electrons are transferred from the [Fe-S] clusters to the protein kinase domain. The histidine protein kinase activates a response regulator. The response regulator is active in the dephosphorylated form. The dephosphorylated response regulator promotes the transcription of the membrane bound hydrogenase and soluble hydrogenase. Membrane-bound hydrogenase The membrane-bound hydrogenase (MBH) is linked to the respiratory chain through a specific cytochrome b-related protein in C. necator. Hydrogen gas is oxidized at the [Ni-Fe] active site in the large subunit and the electrons are shuttled through the [Fe-S] clusters in the small subunit to the cytochrome b-like protein. The MBH is located on the outer cytoplasmic membrane. It recovers energy for the cell by funneling electrons into the respiratory chain and by increasing the proton gradient. The MBH in C. necator is not inhibited by CO and is tolerant to oxygen.  NAD+-reducing hydrogenase  The NAD+-reducing hydrogenase (soluble hydrogenase, SH) creates a NADH-reducing equivalence by oxidizing hydrogen gas. The SH is a heterohexameric protein with two subunits making up the large and small subunits of the [Ni-Fe] hydrogenase and the other two subunits comprising a reductase module similar to the one of Complex I. The [Ni-Fe] active site oxidized hydrogen gas which transfers electrons to a FMN-a cofactor, then to a [Fe-S] cluster relay of the small hydrogenase subunit and the reductase module, then to another FMN-b cofactor and finally to NAD+. The reducing equivalences are then used for fixing carbon dioxide when C. necator is growing autotrophically. The active site of the SH of C. necator H16 has been extensively studied because C. necator H16 can be produced in large amounts, can be genetically manipulated, and can be analyzed with spectrographic techniques. However, no crystal structure is currently available for the C. necator H16 soluble hydrogenase in the presence of oxygen to determine the interactions of the active site with the rest of the protein. =Typical anaerobic [Ni-Fe] hydrogenases= The [Ni-Fe] hydrogenase from Desulfovibrio vulgaris and D. gigas have similar protein structures to each other and represent typical [Ni-Fe] hydrogenases. The large subunit contains the [Ni-Fe] active site buried deep in the core of the protein and the small subunit contains [Fe-S] clusters. The Ni atom is coordinated to the Desulfovibrio hydrogenase by 4 cysteine ligands. Two of these same cysteine ligands also bridge the Fe of the [Ni-Fe] active site. The Fe atom also contains three ligands, one CO and two CN that complete the active site. These additional ligands might contribute to the reactivity or help stabilize the Fe atom in the low spin +2 oxidation state. Typical [NiFe] hydrogenases like those of D. vulgaris and D. gigas are poisoned by oxygen because an oxygen atom binds strongly to the NiFe active site. =C. necator oxygen-tolerant SH= The SH in C. necator are unique for other organisms because it is oxygen tolerant. The active site of the SH has been studied to learn why this protein is tolerant to oxygen. A recent study showed that oxygen tolerance as implemented in the SH is based on a continuous catalytically driven detoxification of O2 [Ref missing]. The genes encoding this SH can be up-regulated under heterotrophic growth condition using glycerol in the growth media and this enables aerobic production and purification of the same enzyme. Applications The oxygen-tolerant hydrogenases of C. necator have been studied for diverse purposes. C. necator was studied as an attractive organism to help support life in space. It can fix carbon dioxide as a carbon source, use the urea in urine as a nitrogen source, and use hydrogen as an energy source to create dense cultures that could be used as a source of protein. Electrolysis of water is one way of creating oxygenic atmosphere in space and C. necator was investigated to recycle the hydrogen produced during this process. Oxygen-tolerant hydrogenases are being used to investigate biofuels. Hydrogenases from C. necator have been used to coat electrode surfaces to create hydrogen fuel cells tolerant to oxygen and carbon monoxide and to design hydrogen-producing light complexes. In addition, the hydrogenases from C. necator have been used to create hydrogen sensors. Genetically modified C. necator can produce isobutanol from that can directly substitute or blend with gasoline. The organism emits the isobutanol without having to be destroyed to obtain it. Industrial uses Researchers at UCLA have genetically modified a strain of the species C. necator (formerly known as R. eutropha H16) to produce isobutanol from CO2 feedstock using electricity produced by a solar cell. The project, funded by the U.S. Dept. of Energy, is a potential high energy- density electrofuel that could use existing infrastructure to replace oil as a transportation fuel.

People feel safer saying things online which they would not say in real life because they have the ability to remain completely anonymous and invisible behind the computer screen. Apart from anonymity, other factors such as asynchronous communication, empathy deficit or individual personality and cultural factors also contribute to online disinhibition. The manifestations of such effect could be in both positive and negative directions. Thus online disinhibition could be classified as benign disinhibition or toxic disinhibition.  Classifications  Benign online disinhibition describes a situation in which people get some benefit from the absence of restraint in cyberspace. One example of benign online disinhibition can be seen as self-disclosure. With the help of Internet anonymity, people could share personal feelings or disclose themselves in the way they are reluctant to do in real life. For instance, young people feel relieved when revealing untold secrets or personally embarrassing details in online chats. Such self-disclosures enable people to establish an intimate interpersonal relationship sooner and stronger when compared with real life face to face communication. The online disinhibition effect also provides chances to express themselves for people who are unwilling to communicate in the real world, like people who are introverted, shy, socially phobic and individuals with a stutter or impaired hearing. Another type of online disinhibition is called toxic disinhibition, which represents an increased tendency towards online flaming and inappropriate behaviors. These often contain hostile language, swearing, and even threats. This norm describes the negative side effect of the loss of inhibition on the cyberspace. The antisocial behaviors caused by toxic disinhibition not only occur in multiple online platforms like blogs, hate sites, and comment sections, but also exist in diverse forms which include cyberbullying, social loafing and more. However, the distinction between benign and toxic online disinhibition is not always clear. For example, a hostile word in the online chat may damage other's self-image, but on the other hand, if the word is genuine, perhaps it may help the person on the receiving end have a better understanding of themselves. Considering the different subcultures of online communities, people may have various tolerance towards a particular social behavior. Another example would be acting as a bystander of online hate. A German study looked at the association between seeing online hate and creating online hate on teenagers. This study found a positive correlation between online hate and creating online hate among teenagers.  Influencing factors  Anonymity, asynchronous communication, and empathy deficit contribute to online disinhibition. Anonymity can make a person feel safe online, like a different person, one might even take on a new persona. It can also make one feel like doing or saying anything is possible because one will most likely not be reprimanded in real life. However, new technologies employed and coming into force by law enforcement partners are increasingly making it easier to combat cybercrime. Asynchronous communication is communication that is not happening live and it can take time for the original message to receive a response. Asynchronous communication affects online disinhibition because one can send a message out into the internet and not get an immediate reply, and log out. Therefore, one doesn't have to think about what is said. On the other hand, this also gives one time to give a more thoughtful response. Empathy deficit is the reduction of being able to identify with others' emotions. There is an empathy deficit because of lack of non-verbal feedback. Through mediated communication it is hard to know what tone and facial expressions accompany the message. So, it makes it harder to empathize with others. Both anonymity and empathy deficit make it harder to perceive others online as people with feelings because of the lack of facial interaction. Several researchers have noted the correlation between Pathological Internet Use and increased online disinhibition, especially among college students. An Australian study found that disinhibition, which is often a predictor of other addictive behaviors, was a poor predictor of heavy Internet use. The joint prevalence of low self-esteem and online disinhibition among pathological internet users suggests that they may find the anonymity and a synchronicity of online interactions liberating, leading to greater disinhibition when they are online. Other research has specifically linked anonymity with greater disinhibited, mob-like behavior on the message board 4chan, while at the same time crediting this disinhibition for some of the more creative meme-generation there. Possible consequences Online disinhibition plays a role in the act of cyberbullying. Cyberbullying is the act of trying to make another person feel embarrassed, intimidated, or bad about themselves through the Internet. Anonymity usually leads to meaner comments towards others (cyberbullying) but it alone doesn't cause cyberbullying. Asynchronous communication allows the bully to say what they have to say and then log out like nothing happened, having to face no consequence outside of the Internet. Empathy deficit is what allows the bully to post the messages in the first place, the victim is reduced to a name on a computer screen. Racist, sexist, violent, and rude online comments aren't the direct result of anonymity. Those comments arise only when other people are also saying things like that; online users tend to keep the same tone, civility/incivility as others in online posts. The online disinhibition effect can have an effect on one's job security and future employment opportunities. Sixteen-year-old Kimberley Swann was fired from her job due to negative comments she made about her occupation on her Facebook page, while another infamous case involved a woman, Heather Armstrong, being terminated after \\"lampooning\\" her colleagues on the Internet. These are consequences of certain Internet users believing themselves to be unchained from typical social strictures. The author of Six Causes of Online Disinhibition states that \\"[c]ompared with face-to-face interactions, online we feel freer to do and say what we want and, as a result, often do and say things we shouldn't\\". Online disinhibition can also have positive outcomes. People that are shy, that feel they can't talk about certain things in their real lives, that may have no vocal outlet can benefit from online disinhibition without causing harm to others. The anonymity of being online allows people to self-disclose more than they do in-person. Online disinhibition can provide a safe place for people of the LGBTQ community (and other marginalized groups) to share information and support one another. It can help students be more interactive in online classrooms than they are in real classrooms.

Windstar turbines were invented by Robert Nason Thomas and developed by Wind Harvest International, Inc., formerly the Wind Harvest Company, based in Point Reyes, California. Windstar turbines are operated as Linear Array Vortex Turbine Systems (LAVTS). Each rotor unit has a dual braking system of pneumatic disc brakes and blade pitch. All Windstar models use off-the-shelf generators, gearboxes, bearings and other components. History In 2001 and 2002, three guyed prototype versions of the Windstar Model 530G were installed in Palm Springs, California. The Model 530G prototype used extruded aluminum blades, was supported by a guyed cable system and was rated at 25 kW. The three 530G turbines were placed in close proximity, creating the first Linear Array Vortex Turbine System (LAVTS). The 530G LAVTS was rated at 75 KW and was run continuously for five years to collect performance data. In 2006, Wind Harvest International began design work on a series of Windstar turbine models to take advantage of the properties demonstrated in the 530G LAVTS prototype: Model 636, 1500 and 3000 turbines. The Model 636 is a direct evolution of the 530G, with an increase in blade length, in order to increase swept area, and including a modified bearing design. The 1500 and 3000 turbine models stand high with a rotor and 50-75 kW generators. The Windstar 1500 is wide and is designed for higher wind speed locations. The Windstar 3000 will be wide to operate better in lower wind speed locations (14-16 mph). Model 636 continues to use extruded aluminum blades, similar to the 530G. Models 1500 and 3000 use pultruded fiberglass blades. By 2010, Windstar Model 636 turbines were placed on the transitional list for approved wind energy generation systems qualifying for the FIT (Feed-in-Tariff) energy pricing in the UK. In 2011, Wind Harvest International, Inc. began the process for MCS certification of the Model 636 LAVTS. Linear Array Vortex Turbine Systems The Linear Array Vortex Turbine System (LAVTS) consists of three or more Windstar vertical-axis rotors, each with their own 25-75 kW generator, placed in a linear array with each rotor's blades passing within two feet of its neighbor. In this configuration, the center rotors gain an increase in energy output and efficiency. Observation of this effect (the coupled vortex effect) on Windstar turbines in field tests led to the issuance of US patent 6784566. Coupled Vortex Effect Windstar turbines are built in arrays of three or more turbines in order to take advantage of the \\"coupled vortex effect.\\" The coupled vortex effect was identified through field tests of Windstar 530G turbines and is made possible by the fact that straight-bladed vertical axis wind turbine blades passing in close proximity to one another in opposite directions create lift and torque on their neighboring blades, boosting the energy production of an array in comparison with a single turbine's performance.

Windstar Model 636 Windstar Model 636 is a commercial model of the Windstar turbine offered by Wind Harvest International, Inc. It is a direct evolution of their earlier guyed model the 530G. It uses similar components with some modifications geared toward the commercial market. Modifications of the design include longer blades and a new bearing assembly. Windstar Models 1500 and 3000 These two models were designed based on field data from the 530G prototype field testing in the LAVTS configuration. Mathematical modeling of these turbines was conducted by IOPARA, Inc., made possible by a grant from the California Energy Commission in 2010. Model 3000 will stand 50 ft high with a 40 ft tall rotor. The Windstar Model 3000 will be 75 ft wide and used for lower wind speed locations (14-16 mph). The Windstar Model 1500 will have a similar rotor height and will be 37.5 ft wide. The Model 1500 is designed for higher wind speed locations.

Juxtlahuaca is a cave and archaeological site in the Mexican state of Guerrero containing murals linked to the Olmec motifs and iconography. Along with the nearby Oxtotitlán cave, Juxtlahuaca walls contain the earliest sophisticated painted art known in Mesoamerica,Grove (2000). and only known example of non-Maya deep cave art in Mesoamerica.Stone (1997). The cave Juxtlahuaca and other Olmec-related sites in the Formative Period. The Juxtlahuaca site is located some 45 km southeast of the state capital Chilpancingo in what is now a National Park. The entire cave system is slightly over 5 km. The caves, also called Grutas de Juxtlahuaca (\\"Grottos of Juxtlahuaca\\"), are a favorite destination of spelunkers. The caves are open to the public, but a local guide is required. The site's paintings have been estimated to be over a kilometre down a long cavern: descent times are roughly two hours and some passages are partially filled with water. The paintings The red jaguar. The most well-known of the cave art is Painting 1, which features a large bearded man with a black cloak, a striped tunic, and an elaborate headpiece. The arms and legs are covered with jaguar fur, and a small jaguar tail is even visible dangling down. The man is brandishing a trident at a much smaller figure crouched to his side and is carrying a long snake or snakelike object.Some have seen this as a rope that is tied to the smaller figure: flowstone may have obscured the object so that it is seen as a snake-like object and a belt around the smaller figure. This 2 meter (6 foot) tall painting is one of the rare Olmec-style portrayals of human-on-human dominance,The other two prominent displays of human-on-human domination are Chalcatzingo's Monument 2 and Altar 4 at La Venta. which some researchers interpret as a scene of human sacrifice.Coe (2005). The feathered serpent. Also of note in Juxtlahuaca is a painting of a red Feathered Serpent with green plumes, near a red jaguar whose large ears and eyes give it a youthful cast. A design that has provisionally been interpreted as a temple was found on a stalagmite.Griffin, p.4. The cave paintings have been known since at least the 1920s, but were first professionally documented in the early 1960s by Gillett Griffin of Princeton University and Carlo T. E. Gay, an Italian businessman. Archaeologist Michael D. Coe has estimated that the paintings \\"might probably be Early Preclassic (1200-900 BC, uncalibrated)\\" in date.Coe (2005). Juxtalhuaca is, so far as is known, unassociated with any large town of that period. It is also not known how Olmec-influenced art came to be painted hundreds of kilometres (or miles) from the Olmec heartland. Caves are prominent on many Olmec-style monuments: several Olmec \\"altars\\" depict priests or rulers emerging from caves, and monuments and reliefs at the archaeological site of Chalcatzingo, to the north of Juxtlahuaca, also feature cave motifs. Other artifacts A photo of the ruler and smaller figure. A dozen skeletons have been found in the so-called Hall of the Dead, located midway between the entrance and the paintings. From their positions, some extended and some in a fetal position, and their condition, covered with a stalactite crust, the skeletons are assumed to be ancient interments. Some have been partially buried as a result of a cave-in.Coe (1968), p. 99. Just before the paintings, a 250-foot (80 m) artificial canal has been cut into the red clay floor of the cave. The purpose of this canal is not known. See also *Maya cave sites *Olmec influences on Mesoamerican cultures *Teopantecuanitlan NotesReferences *Coe, Michael D.

By the 1950s Naini was established as the chief industrial area of the city. History Naini was infamous for its prison, Naini Central Prison, where many freedom fighters—including Pt. Jawahar Lal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India—were imprisoned during the Indian independence movement. The first official Airmail flight in the world arrived in Naini from Allahabad. Henri Pequet carried 6,500 letters a distance of 13 km. This was the first commercial civil aviation flight in India.100 Years of Civil Aviation in India - Milestones. Press Information Bureau, Government of India. 25 January 2011. Geography Naini is located on the banks of River Yamuna, opposite Allahabad City. To the north, across the Ganges, is Jhunsi, which is a part of Allahabad itself. There are no direct paths or roadways between Jhusi and Naini. Economy Naini developed into major industrial centre. Some of the most reputed industries in Naini include Alstom, ITI Limited, Bharat Pumps & Compressors (headquarters), Areva, Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL), Dey's medical, EMC Limited, Food Corporation of India (FCI), Triveni Structurals Limited (TSL) and Cotton Mills subsidiary of Central Government. Industrial development in Naini is increasing as the Government of India has approved Allahabad-Naini-Bara Investment Zone (3000 hectares) which is to be funded by the World Bank. Culture The culture of Naini is typical that of Allahabad. Hindi, Awadhi, Urdu, and Bagheli are the languages that are spoken there. Arail, near Naini, has many Ashrams. Saint Shri Sachcha Baba, one of the pioneers in the tradition of Saints of India has a centre there with many devotees from India and abroad coming to visit. Ashrams located at the Naini Ghat in the Naini area include: *Shri Sachcha Baba Ashram *Maharishi Mahesh Yogi Vidya Peeth *Ishwar prem ashram *Blind School *Hospital for lepers called Leprosy Mission Hospital *Siddha Sanjeevani Charitable Hospital Education=University *Sam Higginbottom University of Agriculture, Technology and Sciences Schools & Colleges *Sam Higginbottom University & of agriculture technology and sciences , Rewa Road, Naini, Allahabad *Bethany Convent School, Naini Allahabad *Prof. Rajendra Singh (Rajju Bhaiya) University *United College of Engineering & Research *Nand Kishore Singh Degree College, Dhanuha, Chaka, Naini, Allahabad *Saint John's Academy, Mirzapur Road, Allahabad *Apex College of Education, Naini, Allahabad * Madhav Gyan Kendra Inter college kharkauni, Naini , Allahabad *Kendriya Vidyalaya ITI Naini,Allahabad *Kendriya Vidyalaya COD Naini,Allahabad *Laurels International School, Naini *Semstar Global School,Naini Transport Naini Railway Junction Station nameplate. Naini is connected to Allahabad via two bridges over the river Yamuna. The older one, Old Naini Bridge was built in 1927, is a two lane bridge. The new one, New Yamuna Bridge was completed in 2004. NH-2 joins the Naini to Rewa through Ghoorpur. Tempos, Bus and autos are the main mode of travel in Naini- Allahabad. This route doesn't have a very frequent local bus service, but recently, UPSRTC has launched the city bus services, making easier the public transportation from Naini to other nearby places, including heart of the city. Apart from Naini Railway, Cheoki station is also used, but mainly it is used for transporting goods. However in recent times, Cheoki railway station has started to become more important as many of the trains are getting their schedule changed where in it is replacing Allahabad Junction itself.

It was built by Walter Brun's Brun Motorsport of Switzerland, by a team which included Steve Ridgers, John Iley and Hayden Burvill. It is the only car that Brun has built to date. Development Following the end of the EuroBrun Formula One partnership in 1990, Brun Motorsport found itself concentrating on the World Sportscar Championship for 1991. At the time using their familiar Porsche 962, Brun began work on a new car intended to begin competition in late 1991 and then continuing into 1992, when the new World Sportscar Championship would come into effect. These new rules, which required 3.5 liter engines would make their 962 illegal. Therefore, instead of buying another chassis, Brun and backer and sponsor Repsol YPF decided to invest in building a new car, naming it the C91. The design would be similar to most other 3.5 liter Group C cars, using large double rear wings, low bodywork and long high downforce noses. For an engine, Brun would retain a connection he had had during the EuroBrun days. Since World Sportscar Championship regulations would allow for engines identical to Formula One days, Brun reached an agreement with Engine Developments to use older F1 Judd EV V8s, a successor to the Judd CVs V8s that EuroBrun had used. Racing history To start 1991, Brun campaigned a pair of 962 to some success, earning points in every race of the season until the debut of the C91 at the fifth round at the Nürburgring. The C91 would be driven by former EuroBrun drivers Gregor Foitek and Oscar Larrauri. Unfortunately, the car would not race due to technical difficulties after qualifying. At the next round at Magny-Cours, Jésus Pareja would replace Foitek as the C91 would start the race. Unfortunately its competition debut was short lived as the engine would fail after a mere five laps. For the fly-away round in Mexico City, the C91 would show some more potential by lasting 31 laps before a failed starter motor forced it to retire. However, for the final round in Autopolis, Japan, the C91 would yet again fail, having only made it 20 laps before the gearbox broke. Thus at the end of the season, the C91 had yet to finish a single race. Brun would manage to score points with their 962 in each of the rounds except Magny-Cours and Suzuka. Brun intended to enter the car in 1992, but unfortunately funding failed to materialize and the C91 was retired. The car would later be sold to private owners, and is currently being run in Historic Sportscar Racing.

Kinsey is best known as a visionary who sought to take The Walt Disney Company in the direction of computer animated films (chronicled in the books Disney War and The Pixar Touch). Career Originally from Indiana, Stan Kinsey completed his undergrad studies at DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana and received his MBA at Stanford University. Kinsey was in the same class as Scott McNealy of Sun Microsystems fame. At Disney, young Kinsey was a considered a \\"golden boy\\" by top Disney executives Frank Wells and Ron W. Miller. Kinsey had thrived running the Operations and New Technology group, and was Disney's chief technologist under executive Ron Miller. He championed the direction toward films created using computer animation. He saw the potential of computer animation and wanted the company to purchase Pixar, a collaborator and supplier of high-end computer hardware for the secretive Computer Animation Production System (CAPS) project. Kinsey believed the CAPS could \\"return Disney animation to its glory days by developing new computer technology.\\" However, he was to be overruled by Miller's replacement and new chairman of Disney's film division, Jeffrey Katzenberg. Katzenberg and Michael Eisner had brought a new culture to the Disney company as profiled in the book Disney War. Kinsey continued to clash with Katzenberg and eventually left the company in 1985. After the departure of Kinsey from Disney, Katzenberg relented and continued the partnership with Pixar and development of the CAPS championed by Kinsey. The evolution of CAPS and Pixar resulted in the great success envisioned by Kinsey. An Oscar for Scientific and Engineering Achievement was awarded in 1992 to the team that developed the CAPS system. Pixar became the Pixar Animation Studios, which went on to win 26 academy awards, 7 Golden Globes, and 3 Grammy Awards, and generate over $6.3 billion worldwide in revenue by the early 2000s. (The Walt Disney Company did purchase Pixar Animation Studios outright on January 24, 2006 for 7.4 billion.) Kinsey left Disney in 1985 and founded Iwerks Entertainment with Disney Legend Don Iwerks. Iwerks Entertainment became well known as a leading developer of special films, venues, and virtual reality theaters throughout the world. He was Chairman and CEO of Iwerks for 10 years. Kinsey left Iwerks in 1995 and became CEO of entertainment technology company called NTN Buzztime, an interactive television company. The company was known for its bar trivia online games. He was Chairman and CEO of NTN for 10 years. Kinsey became CEO of Nigel Power LLC in 2005, a manufacturer of wireless communications equipment based in San Diego. Kinsey built and moved the company forward, incorporating in 2006 and becoming an acquisition and subsidiary of Qualcomm in 2009.

Stuart Ayres was appointed to succeed Roberts in his Fair Trading portfolio. Following the resignation of Barry O'Farrell as Premier, and the subsequent ministerial reshuffle by Mike Baird, the new Liberal Leader, in April 2014, Roberts assumed the role of Leader of the House in the Legislative Assembly, in addition to his Ministerial responsibilities. Following the 2015 state election, Roberts was sworn in as the Minister for Industry, Resources and Energy, and retained his role as Leader of the House. In this role, Roberts was tasked with the creation of 150,000 jobs in NSW over four years, promoting industry development in NSW and leading the newly created Department of Industry, Skills and Regional Development. Following the resignation of Mike Baird as Premier, Gladys Berejiklian was elected as Liberal leader and sworn in as Premier. The Berejiklian ministry was subsequently formed with Roberts sworn in as the Minister for Planning, the Minister for Housing, and the Special Minister of State with effect from 30 January 2017. He retained his responsibilities as the Leader of the House.

With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2011.  History (Information gleaned from the Love history book Love At First Site and interviews with residents.) In the early years, the village was called Love Siding because of the railroad siding located there. The Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) had extended its tracks through the area in 1929, building sidings as it moved north and west from Nipawin to White Fox, Love, Garrick and ending in Choiceland. The siding was provided by the CPR for the loading of firewood, pulp, lumber and other forest products, later adding agricultural and dairy products as farming developed. The village was named after the conductor of the first train to pass through the siding - Tom Love. Development began in 1934 with the building of a general store by William (Bill) Sears, assisted by Emery Long. In 1935, a Royal Mail Canada post office was established in the store, with Mr. Sears as postmaster. The first houses were built by Eldon Lamb and Walter and Myrtle Haight and in 1936 Grant and Ray Emery built a general store for Lamb and Earl Johnston who were operating a lumber mill nearby. The population grew as millworkers and lumberjacks moved into the unincorporated community, building homes (usually little more than shacks) for their families. With no official town-site surveyed, the homes were built wherever there was room. In 1939, the provincial government offered a block of land for sale on the east side of the SW‑16‑52‑15‑W2. Because the homeowners wanted title to their property the Love Development Company was formed to tender a successful bid of $1200 ($ today) for the entire block. The land was surveyed into a townsite of organized lots, which were sold at $50, $75 and $100. Anyone who already lived on one of the lots had the option of purchasing it. Love incorporated as a village on June 2, 1945. In July 1945, at the first council meeting for the Village of Love, it was decided that the village would buy out the remaining unsold assets of the Love Development Company. More lumber mills located in and around the village, which grew to a peak population of approximately 250 by the 1950s, by which time the local timber was becoming depleted and agriculture had grown considerably. In its heyday the village had two general stores, a hotel with a beer parlour (bar), a pool hall, a couple of cafes, an insurance office, a couple of gas stations which included general auto repair and a few other businesses catering to people involved in the lumber industry. As farming grew, a United Grain Growers grain elevator had been built in 1947 for the convenience of the farmers in the area. With the building of the large inland grain terminals on the prairies of the Canadian west, the small grain elevators were no longer needed and most, including the one at Love, were demolished. The CPR discontinued service in about 2002 with the closing of the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool elevator at Choiceland. In 2008, a number of local business people and investors purchased the Nipawin to Choiceland tracks, which now operates as the Torch River Rail. On Halloween night of 1987 there was a drunken bar brawl which took place at the local bar, The Hillbilly Haven. there was fisticuffs and tomfoolery afoot. The police had to intervene. The famed author, artist and poet Donald Burke was there as a young boy. He wrote about the incident in his New York Times best selling novel When It All Went Down. The village has received some international recognition due to its unique postmark consisting of a teddy bear holding a heart. People from many parts of the world have sent bundles of wedding invitations to the Love post office to be stamped with the romantically oriented post mark and then forwarded to their final destinations.

Playing career Hughes began his career with his local side, Chelsea, and started well, scoring on his debut against Derby County with an impressive solo effort which was featured on the BBC’s goal of the month competition. Thereafter, however, his career was stalled by injuries, successive managers' squad rotation policies and the signing of other midfielders like Roberto Di Matteo, Gustavo Poyet and Didier Deschamps. Chelsea won the 1996–97 FA Cup; Hughes was left out of the squad for the final but played in the previous rounds including an impressive performance in the 4-1 win over Portsmouth in the quarter-final. Portsmouth. The following year Chelsea won the European Cup Winners Cup (1997–98) and although Hughes played in the earlier rounds of the competition he made the squad but did not make the bench for the final in Stockholm. Over the next three years he featured in 24 more games for the club, and had successful loan spells with Stockport County, Crewe Alexandra and Norwich City (where he scored against Swindon Town). Hughes was recruited by Southampton, then managed by his old Chelsea manager Glenn Hoddle, on a free transfer in the summer of 2000, but due to a lengthy groin injury and subsequent change of manager, left a year later. Hughes' next club was Luton Town, where he remained until May 2006, making 88 appearances and scoring seven goals for the club helping them gain promotion from League 2 and become champions of League 1. Coaching and management career In 2012, Hughes was appointed joint manager at Kings Langley alongside Ritchie Hanlon. The pair led Kings Langley to three consecutive promotions in 2014, 2015 and 2016. They finished 2nd in Spartan South Midlands Division One in 2014, and then winning the Spartan South Midlands Premier Division title in 2015. The third consecutive promotion saw Kings Langley FC become champions of the Southern Central Division and took the club to the Southern Premier Division for the first time in its history. Hughes, alongside Hanlon, moved to Hayes & Yeading United in November 2016. Hughes became the sole manager following Hanlon's departure in 2017. Hughes took Hayes & Yeading FC to a 3rd place finish in the Isthmian League South Central Division in 2018 but lost 1-0 to Cambridge City in the play offs. The following year saw his team break a number of club records to secure the Isthmian League South Central Title in 2019. An impressive +93 goal difference and a remarkable 129 goals scored ensured Hayes & Yeading FC would play Step 3 football in the Southern Premier the following season. That following season saw Hayes & Yeading FC go on a superb FA Cup run by reaching the 1st round proper, only to lose 2-0 at home to Karl Robinson's League One Oxford Utd in a live BBC televised game at the SKYEX Arena. The Southern Premier League season ended prematurely due to the CoVid19 pandemic with Hughes‘ team sitting in 3rd place.

He was a painter of history scenes, genre scenes, and portraits. Life Hallé was the son of Sir Charles Hallé, the German-born pianist and orchestra conductor, who emigrated to England during the revolution of 1848. His younger sister was the sculptor and inventor Elinor Hallé CBE. His first professors were Richard Doyle and the Carlo Marochetti when he entered the School of the Royal Academy in London. At seventeen years of age he traveled to France and worked with Victor Mottez, a student of Ingres. From France he traveled to Italy. He was attracted to the tradition of Neo-Classicism found in Rome. Upon his return to London he exhibited four paintings at the Royal Academy in London in 1866, and then departed for Venice. He studied the techniques of the Venetian Masters and tried to paint in their style. He then returned to England and settled permanently in London. In 1877 with J. Comyns Carr, he assisted Lord Coutts Lindsay in the creation of the Grosvenor Gallery. In 1888 with Burne-Jones, he founded the New Gallery in Regent Street. In 1909 he published his reminiscences, Notes from a Painter's Life, a valuable if somewhat cantankerous source-book. He exhibited frequently in the two galleries he helped found. His works have been displayed in the museum in Sheffield. Pre- Raphaelites Despite having been born only two years prior to the founding the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, stylistically Hallé was firmly aligned with the aesthetic of that group. Charles Hallé is mentioned very fondly by Isadora Duncan in her book titled \\"My Life' published in 1927, the year of her death. She describes the activities she and Charles enjoyed together in Paris, long strolls, trips to the countryside, gallery tramping and dining.

A plan of the Oxtotitlán grottos, showing the locations of the various paintings. The yellow lines represent the grotto entrances, while the brown lines show grotto walls. An artist's rendition of painting 1-D, showing the outline of a ruler and rearing jaguar. Oxtotitlán is a natural rock shelter and archaeological site in Chilapa de Álvarez, Mexican state of Guerrero that contains murals linked to the Olmec motifs and iconography. Along with the nearby Juxtlahuaca cave, the Oxtotitlán rock paintings represent the \\"earliest sophisticated painted art known in Mesoamerica\\", thus far. Unlike Juxtlahuaca, however, the Oxtotitlán paintings are not deep in a cave system but rather occupy two shallow grottos on a cliff face. The paintings have been variously dated to perhaps 900 years BCE. It is not known what group or society painted them. It is also not known how Olmec- influenced art came to be painted hundreds of kilometers (or miles) from the Olmec heartland, although caves are prominent on many Olmec-style monuments, including La Venta Altars 4 and 5.  Description  The Paintings cover an area of about There is restoration work in 10 walls, it is expected to complete scientific investigation and establish the origin of the paints used in the designs. The best-known samples of Oxtotitlán paintings are those part of the core group. These are two Polychrome murals, one of which represent a sitting character on a mythological Olmec serpent, wearing a mask, according to Grove, could be a representation of an Owl. The other mural of the central group has been severely damaged by time and the environment, making it difficult to identify. Internal murals are monochrome (black and white), or bi-chromos, combining elements of red and black. Unlike Juxtlahuaca, it is possible that Oxtotitlán contained a housing area,Reyna and Schmidt, 2006: 40. because ceramic materials have been found in the vicinity of the Quiotepec Hill. Distribution The paintings are distributed in three areas with a separate type of painting assigned to each area. North grotto The paintings are smaller, were created using black pigment, and feature animals, humans, and legendary creatures. South grotto The paintings here, by contrast, are in red and generally feature geometric designs. Central grotto Between the north and south grottos are two large polychrome murals, over the cave entrance. The Murals=Mural 1 This MuralAlso variously identified as Painting C-1 and M-1. is situated above the mouth to the south grotto, and portrays what is most likely a ruler seated upon a throne similar to La Venta's Altar 4 or 5. The eyes of a primal cave monster, showing Olmec iconic crossed-bars, can be seen on the top edge of the throne (note that the ruler is also wearing a crossed-bars pectoral, perhaps linking him directly with the monster). The ruler, painted in vibrant reds, greens, and browns, is wearing a bird mask, generally identified as that of an owl,Also Diehl, page 171. as well as a green-feathered costume. Seated on the throne, his left leg is tucked underneath him while the right dangles down, similar to a pose found on the fragmentary Laguna de los Cerros Monument 9. Mural 2 This Mural, at , is even larger than Mural 1 but this exposed painting has been largely worn away over the intervening millennia and is now almost impossible to recognize. It seems to picture a human in jaguar clothing or otherwise associated with a jaguar. Also of particular note is the north grotto's \\"most striking creation\\",Diehl, p. 171. Painting 1-D, which features an ithyphallic man standing behind what appears to be a rearing jaguar. The man is painted in black outline, with a headdress. His exaggerated genitals that point to the jaguar have led to speculation that this is a scene of a man copulating with a jaguar, but more likely the jaguar is the ruler's spiritual co-essence, later known in Classic Maya culture as a way spirit. Preservation and visitation In the 30 years following its re-discovery, the site was the object of graffiti and poor maintenance. This was addressed in the 2002 by the restoration work of Sandra Cruz, under the auspices of the National Coordination of Conservation of the Cultural Patrimony, INAH- Churubusco.Conaculta 2004 Although the paintings can still be viewed, visitors must first register with the local caretakers in the nearby village of Acatlán.

While a wedge plow can remove snow above the surface of the rails, the flanger removes snow and ice from below the surface of the rails where the railway wheel flanges fit. Railway locomotives and cars can be derailed if the flangeway is filled. The flanger blades are lowered below the head of the rail. Blades typically throw the snow and ice to the left of the left rail and to the right of the right rail. Some flangers have a single V-shaped blade extending between both rails while others with a separate blade for each rail are better adapted to lines with guard rails. Some blades work while the car moves either frontwards or backwards, while other flangers have one blade for forward movement and a different blade for backward movement. While early railway wedge plows required a separate flanger, many modern plows also include flanger blades. To avoid damaging the flanger blades, the operator must raise them when the flanger car approaches a railroad switch or grade crossing.

They count various notable political figures among their number. Early settlement The first Japanese person to settle in Russia is believed to have been Dembei, a fisherman stranded on the Kamchatka Peninsula in 1701 or 1702. Unable to return to his native Ōsaka due to the Tokugawa Shogunate's sakoku policy, he was instead taken to Moscow and ordered by Peter the Great to begin teaching the language as soon as possible; he thus became the father of Japanese language education in Russia. Japanese settlement in Russia remained sporadic, confined to the Russian Far East, and also of a largely unofficial character, consisting of fishermen who, like Dembei, landed there by accident and were unable to return to Japan. However, a Japanese trading post is known to have existed on the island of Sakhalin (then claimed by the Qing dynasty, but controlled by neither Japan, China, nor Russia) as early as 1790. Opening of Japan Following the opening of Japan, Vladivostok would become the focus of settlement for Japanese emigrating to Russia. A branch of the was opened there in 1876. See section \\"Japanese Communities within the Russian Far East and Their Economic Activities\\" Their numbers grew to 80 people in 1877 and 392 in 1890; women outnumbered men by a factor of 3:2, and many worked as prostitutes. (Pages 47-49) However, their community remained small compared to the more numerous Chinese and Korean communities; an 1897 Russian government survey showed 42,823 Chinese, 26,100 Koreans, but only 2,291 Japanese in the whole of the Primorye area. A large portion of the migration came from villages in northern Kyūshū. The politics of Japanese-Russian relations had a large influence on the Japanese community and the sources and patterns of Japanese settlement in Russia. The was founded in 1892 to unite various Japanese professional unions; at that point, the Japanese population of the city was estimated at 1,000. It would later be renamed in 1895 as the and again in 1902 as the . They were often suspected by the Russian government of being used as intelligence-gathering tools for Japan, and having contributed to Russia's defeat in the Russo-Japanese War. Though the Japanese residents' association in Vladivostok was officially disbanded in 1912 under pressure from Russia, Japanese government documents show it continued to operate clandestinely until 1920, when most Japanese in Vladivostok returned to Japan. The initial landing of Japanese forces in Vladivostok after the October Revolution was prompted by the April 4, 1918 murder of three Japanese living there, and the Nikolayevsk Incident which occurred in 1920. After the establishment of the Soviet Union, some Japanese communists settled in Russia; for example, Mutsuo Hakamada, the brother of Japanese Communist Party chairman Satomi Hakamada, escaped from Japan in 1938 and went to Russia, where he married a local woman. His daughter Irina later went into politics after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Aftermath of World War II=Sakhalin After the end of the Russo-Japanese War in 1905 with the Treaty of Portsmouth, the southern half of Sakhalin officially became Japanese territory, and was renamed as Karafuto, prompting an influx of Japanese settlers there. Japanese settled in the northern half of Karafuto; after Japan agreed to hand this half back to the Soviet Union, some may have chosen to remain north of the Soviet line of control. However, the majority would remain in Japanese territory until the closing days of World War II, when the whole of Sakhalin came under Soviet control as part of the USSR's invasion of Manchuria; most Japanese fled the advancing Red Army, or returned to Japan after the Soviet takeover, but others, mainly military personnel, were taken to the mainland of Russia and detained in work camps there. Furthermore, roughly 40,000 Korean settlers, despite still holding Japanese nationality, were denied permission by the Soviet Government to transit through Japan to repatriate to their homes in the southern half of the Korean peninsula. They were either told to take North Korean citizenship or take Soviet citizenship. Known as Sakhalin Koreans, they were trapped on the island for almost four decades. Prisoners of war Following Japan's surrender, 575,000 Japanese prisoners of war captured by the Red Army in Manchuria, Karafuto, and Korea were sent to camps in Siberia and the rest of the Soviet Union. According to figures of the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare, 473,000 were repatriated to Japan after the normalisation of Japanese-Soviet relations; 55,000 died in Russia, and another 47,000 remained missing; a Russian report released in 2005 listed the names of 27,000 who had been sent to North Korea to perform forced labour there. Rank was no guarantee of repatriation; one Armenian interviewed by the US Air Force in 1954 claims to have met a Japanese general while living in a camp at Chunoyar, Krasnoyarsk Krai between May 1951 and June 1953. Some continue to return home as late as 2006. Post-normalisation Following the normalisation of Japanese-Soviet relations, a few Japanese went to Russia for commercial, educational, or diplomatic purposes; however, as Vladivostok was closed to foreign settlement until the 1970s, they instead concentrated in Moscow. There is one Japanese- medium school, the Japanese School in Moscow, founded in 1965. The 2002 Russian census showed 835 people claiming Japanese ethnicity (nationality). 2008 figures from Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs state that 1,607 Japanese nationals reside in Russia. Education The Japanese School in Moscow is a Japanese international day school in Moscow.

The film stars Gian Maria Volonté as Vanzetti, Riccardo Cucciolla as Sacco, Cyril Cusack as prosecutor Frederick G. Katzmann, Geoffrey Keen as presiding justice Webster Thayer, Milo O'Shea as defense attorney Fred Moore, with Rosanna Fratello, William Prince, and Sergio Fantoni. The musical score was composed and conducted by Ennio Morricone with the three-part ballad sung by Joan Baez. The film is mainly shot in colour although it both starts and finishes in black and white, and also includes period black and white newsreels. The film was an Italian and French co-production, shot on-location in Dublin, Ireland. It was released in separate Italian and English-language versions. Cast Music  The film's soundtrack was composed and conducted by Ennio Morricone, with song lyrics by the American folk singer Joan Baez. For the lyrics of \\"The Ballad of Sacco and Vanzetti Part 1,\\" Baez made use of Emma Lazarus' 1883 sonnet The New Colossus, the lines of which appear inscribed on a bronze plaque in the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty.Watts, Emily Stipes. The Poetry of American Women from 1632 to 1945. Austin: University of Texas Press, 1977: 123. The song \\"Here's to You\\" is sung at the end of the film. For the lyrics of \\"Here's to You\\" Baez made use of a statement attributed to Vanzetti by Philip D. Strong, a reporter for the North American Newspaper Alliance who visited Vanzetti in prison in May 1927, three months before his execution: \\"Here's to You\\" is also included in several later films, notably in the 1978 quasi-documentary film Germany in Autumn where it accompanies footage of the funeral march for Red Army Faction members Andreas Baader, Gudrun Ensslin, and Jan-Carl Raspe, who had committed suicide in prison. The song became known to a younger video game-playing generation, due to its appearance in the Metal Gear Solid series (both in Metal Gear Solid 4 and Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes, where it is featured within the latter game's story). The film soundtrack was released in a downloadable format in 2005 featuring fourteen tracks: # \\"Speranze di libertà\\" # \\"La ballata di Sacco e Vanzetti, Pt. 1\\" # \\"Nel carcere\\" # \\"La ballata di Sacco e Vanzetti, Pt. 2\\" # \\"Sacco e il figlio\\" # \\"Speranze di libertà\\" (#2) # \\"Nel carcere\\" (#2) # \\"La ballata di Sacco e Vanzetti, Pt. 3\\" # \\"Libertà nella speranza\\" # \\"E dover morire\\" # \\"Sacco e il figlio\\" (#2) # \\"La sedia elettrica\\" # \\"Libertà nella speranza\\" (#2) # \\"Here's to You\\" Reception Roger Ebert described the film as \\"one of the best\\" of the year. Ebert drew particular attention to the way that Montaldo handled his courtroom scenes: \\"A tricky area for any director, but one which the director handles in an interesting and maybe even brand-new way.\\" Ebert wrote, With regard to the historical accuracy of the film, Ebert considered the film to be Despite his friends' criticism that the film was \\"just another left-wing, European blast at the United States,\\" Vincent Canby, in a review for The New York Times, praised the film, if for nothing more than calling \\"to our attention a terrible chapter in American history.\\" Canby, however, dismissed the film as a simplification that Canby also decried the film's soundtrack, which he described as \\"absolutely dreadful,\\" with Baez's voice \\"used to certify the movie's noble intentions, but through the cheapest of means.\\" Awards In May 1971, Sacco & Vanzetti was a competition entry at the 24th International Film Festival of Cannes where, for his portrayal of Nicola Sacco, Riccardo Cucciolla won the award for Best Actor. Also that year, Rosanna Fratello was awarded Best Young Actress by the Association of Italian Film Journalists for her portrayal of Rosa Sacco (the wife of Nicola Sacco). In 1972, Morricone won from the Association of Italian Film Journalists the Nastro d'Argento ( Silver Band ) prize in the division Best Original Score.

Life  Ambaghai was born to Sorqaduqtu China, a son of Charaqai Lingqum who in turn was son of Khaidu Khan. His father is mentioned as Senggüm Bilge in The Secret History of the Mongols. A member of the cadet branch of Borjigin clan, he was ruler of the Taichuud tribe and later khan of Khamag Mongol. According to Rashidaddin, he succeeded Khabul Khan, because he was seniormost in Borjigid line. Towards end of his rule, he was captured alongside Khabul Khan's son Tödö'en Otchigin by the Tatars when he was on a trip to marry his son Qadaan Taishi to a daughter of chief of the Airu'ut Tatars. In fact, this was done under the commands of the Jurchen Jin dynasty in response to the Mongols' growing power. He was brought to Jin capital Zhongdu was executed by crucifixion and later hacked to death.Kubilay Atik, DYNASTIC RELATIONS IN EAST ASIA DURING THE 10TH-14TH CENTURIES, p. 177 Sources do not give exact date on Ambaghai's reign or death date.

Built in 1930 for the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), it has served as the primary trading venue of the CBOT and later the CME Group, formed in 2007 by the merger of the CBOT and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. In 2012, the CME Group sold the CBOT Building to a consortium of real estate investors, including GlenStar Properties LLC and USAA Real Estate Company. The CBOT has been located at the site since 1885. A building designed by William W. Boyington stood at the location , being the tallest building in Chicago from its construction until its clock tower was removed in 1895\\\\. The Boyington building became unsound in the 1920s and was demolished in 1929, being replaced by the current building designed by Holabird & Root. The current building was itself Chicago's tallest until 1965, when it was surpassed by the Richard J. Daley Center. The current structure is known for its art deco architecture, sculptures and large-scale stone carving, as well as large trading floors. An aluminum, three-story art deco statue of Ceres, goddess of agriculture (particularly grain), caps the building. The building is a popular sightseeing attraction and location for shooting movies, and its owners and management have won awards for efforts to preserve the building and for office management. The building was listed as a Chicago Landmark in 1977 and a National Historic Landmark and National Register of Historic Places honoree in 1978. Early history=Early locations On April 3, 1848, the Board of Trade opened for business at 101 South Water Street. When 122 members were added in 1856, it was moved to the corner of South Water and LaSalle Streets. After another temporary relocation west on South Water Street in 1860, the first permanent home was established within the Chamber of Commerce Building on the corner of LaSalle and Washington Streets in 1865. In 1871, the Great Chicago Fire destroyed this building. The exchange temporarily reopened two weeks after the fire in a wooden building known as \\"the Wigwam\\" at the intersection of Washington and Market Streets, before reclaiming its home in a new building constructed at the Chamber of Commerce site one year later. 1885 building \\"On the evening of December 1, 1885, the tower of the new Board of Trade was illuminated by one of the most powerful lights ever devised,...and can be seen at a distance of sixty miles\\". The lights were provided with power from the building's own generator. In 1882 construction began on the CBOT's new home, which opened at the current location on May 1, 1885. The building was designed by William W. Boyington, best known today for his work on the Chicago Water Tower. It faced Jackson Street with feet of frontage and was built from structural steel and granite taken from the Fox Island quarry near Vinalhaven, Maine. With a rear of enameled brick, it was 10 stories tall and featured a tower tall containing a large clock and bell, topped by a copper weather vane in the shape of a ship. The interiors were finished in mahogany and frescoed. Construction cost $1.8 million (about in terms). With four elevators and a great hall measuring and high decorated by a stained-glass skylight and ornate stone balusters, it was the first commercial building in Chicago to have electric lighting. It was also the first building in the city to exceed in height and at the time was the tallest building in Chicago. The building's formal dedication ceremonies, which were described by a contemporary as \\"brilliant and imposing\\", took place on April 29, 1885 and were attended by over four thousand persons including dignitaries from around the world. Postcard circa 1907 depicting the Board of Trade, after the clock tower had been removed. The building attracted tourists, visitors, and protesters. The inaugural banquet for the building opening was marched on by a sizable column of Chicago labor activists, under the International Working People's Association banner and led by Albert Parsons, Lucy Parsons, and Lizzie Holmes. \\"The building, on which two million dollars had been lavished in the midst of an economic depression, was denounced by the anarchists as... the crowning symbol of all that was hateful in the private property system.\\". The procession were cheered by thousands of spectators. Their access to the Board of Trade was blocked by a phalanx of police, first at Jackson, then at LaSalle, finally coming to within a half- block of the building, \\"bathed in a sea of electric light only recently installed for the occasion.\\" Viewing galleries were opened to the public for the first time in honor of the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition. Two years later, the clock tower was removed and the \\"tallest building in Chicago\\" record was then held by the tall Masonic Temple Building.Zaloom, p. 27 Built on caissons surrounded by muck, the trading house was rendered structurally unsound in the 1920s when construction began across the street on the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. The 1885 building was subsequently demolished in 1929, and the exchange temporarily moved to Van Buren and Clark while a new building was constructed at the LaSalle and Jackson site. The 1885 allegorical architectural sculptures of Industry and Agriculture, two figures of a four- piece set, were removed from the original building and now stand in a nearby pedestrian plaza. 1930 building Night view of the top of The Chicago Board of Trade with the statue of Ceres clearly visible Architecture In 1925, the Chicago Board of Trade commissioned Holabird & Root to design the current building. The general contractors Hegeman & Harris built it for $11.3 million, although the reported twenty-year mortgage value was $12 millionBruegmann, p. 23Bruegmann, p. 34 ($12 million in 1925 equates to about in dollars). Clad in gray Indiana limestone, topped with a copper pyramid roof, and standing on a site running east–west on Jackson Boulevard and north–south on LaSalle Street, the tall art deco-styled building opened on June 9, 1930. It serves as the southern border for the skyscrapers hugging LaSalle Street and is taller than surrounding structures for several blocks. The Chicago Board of Trade has operated continuously on its fourth floor since the 1930 opening, dedicating to what was then the world's largest trading floor. Built in 1930 and first designated a Chicago Landmark on May 4, 1977, the building was listed as a National Historic Landmark on June 2, 1978. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on June 16, 1978. The advent of steel frame structural systems allowed completely vertical construction; but as with many skyscrapers of the era, the exterior was designed with multiple setbacks at increasing heights, which served to allow additional light into the ever- deepening concrete valleys in urban cores. At night, the setbacks are upwardly lit by floodlights, further emphasizing the structure's vertical elements. The night illumination design was a common contemporary Chicago architectural theme, seen also in the Wrigley Building, the Jewelers Building, the Palmolive Building, the LaSalle-Wacker Building, and the Tribune Tower.Saliga, Pauline A. (ed.), p. 113. Ceres, at the top of the building Interior decoration includes polished surfaces throughout, the use of black and white marble, prominent vertical hallway trim, and an open three-story lobby which at the time of opening housed the world's largest light fixture. Though One LaSalle Street had five more floors, the CBOT building was the first in Chicago to exceed a height of . After surpassing the Chicago Temple Building, it was the tallest in Chicago until the Daley Center was completed in 1965. Known for its work on the Brooklyn Bridge, the family-operated factory of John A. Roebling supplied all of the cables used in the building's 23 Otis elevators. Beneath the main trading floor over of telephone and telegraph wires were once hidden. No less than of wires (considered possibly the most direct long-distance wire from any building) once ran from the room.Bruegmann, p. 39 Although the building was commissioned for the Chicago Board of Trade, its first tenant was the Quaker Oats Company, which moved in on May 1, 1930.Bruegmann, p. 35 Artwork John W. Norton's three-story mural of Ceres. Sculptural work by Alvin Meyer, the one-time head of Holabird & Root's sculpture department, is prominent on the building's façade, and represents the trading activities within. On each side of the diameter clock facing LaSalle Street are hooded figures, a Babylonian holding grain and a Native American holding corn.Zaloom, p. 28 Similar figures are repeated at the uppermost corners of the central tower, just below the sloping roof. About above street level, representations of bulls protrude directly from the limestone cladding on the building's north side and to a lesser degree on the east side, a reference to a bull market. The central structure is capped by a 6,500 pound, tall aluminum statue by sculptor John H. Storrs of the Roman goddess of grain, Ceres, holding a sheaf of wheat in the left hand and a bag of corn in the right hand, as a nod to the exchange's heritage as a commodities market. This statue was assembled from 40 pieces. Commissioned in 1930 but removed from the agricultural trading room in 1973 and stored until 1982, John W. Norton's three-story mural of Ceres shown bare-breasted in a field of grain underwent extensive restoration in Spring Grove, Illinois by Louis Pomerantz before being displayed in the atrium of the 1980s addition. Trading floor at the Chicago Board of Trade, 1973 Trading floor at the Chicago Board of Trade, 1993 Trading floor According to the June 16, 1930 issue of Time magazine, visitors carrying ripened wheat heads stared in curiosity at the six-story tall trading room directly above the lobby and behind the large windows below the clock facing LaSalle Street. At the center of the room, Time reported on the items being traded in \\"pits\\" organized based on commodities type with pits names such as the corn pit, soybean pit or wheat pit. The individual pits are raised octagonal structures where open outcry trading occurs. Steps up the outside of each octagon provide an amphitheater atmosphere, and enable a large number of traders to see each other and communicate during trading hours. With early versions dating back to 1870, this type of trading pit was patented in 1878. The trading area is surrounded by desks allowing workers to support transactions. In the early days, the desks served as a relay point between the pits and those wishing to buy or sell. When trade orders and information began to be communicated by telegraph, Morse code operators were employed, later replaced by phone operators. In the late 20th century, electric display boards lined the walls of the trading hall and the advent of electronic trading resulted in computers being placed on desktops. Subsequent additions to the Board of Trade Building moved the agricultural and financial trading floors out of the original trading room and into new spaces in the additions to the building's rear in the 1980s. In 2004 the historic 1930 trading floor, already substantially altered (and unused for more than two years), was demolished and its pits filled with concrete. It was renovated in a modern style and now is leased to a privately owned options trading firm. Outdoor building detail depicting crops Expansion In 1980, the owners added a 23-story expansion to the south side of the building.Zaloom, p. 45 It was topped by an octagonal ornament shaped similarly to the terraced trading pits and was designed in a postmodern style by Helmut Jahn. Colored black and silver, with a sunlit atrium on the 12th floor facing the south wall of the older structure, the annex provided a four-story granite lined agricultural trading floor, then the world's largest at . Even as the Sydney Futures Exchange and other markets were ceasing outcry trading, Mayor Richard M. Daley led the groundbreaking on January 17, 1995, for additional expansion into a five-story building to the east designed by architects Fujikawa Johnson and structural engineers TT-CBM. When opened in 1997, the $175 million structure would add of trading space and for a period again would house the world's largest trading floor. It was nicknamed the \\"Arboretum\\" by some in reference to expansion supporter CBOT Chairman Patrick H. Arbor. The expansion included price boards long and supported 12,000 computers, 6,000 voice devices, and 2,000 video devices requiring of cable. Collectively, the trading floors now encompass approximately . The logo of the CBOT represents a trading pit, and appears prominently on stonework facing Clark Street and on street-level barriers at the service entrance on Van Buren Street. The addition has a twelve-story atrium and melds historical and contemporary design with art deco references such as setbacks, central tower, symmetrical projecting wings, pyramidal roof and abstract cascade and scallop lobby design.Saliga, Pauline A. (ed.), pp. 159–60. Between the original and new buildings, where there was formerly a street, a wide street-level walkway connects the plaza on LaSalle Street to Van Buren Street in what would ordinarily be the building's first floor. Passing over the Van Buren Street elevated tracks, a green glass-enclosed steel-frame bridge connects the lower southwest corner of the 23 story addition to the Chicago Board Options Exchange (although this bridge was closed to pedestrian traffic in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks for security reasons). Renovation and 21st century In 2005, the building underwent an extensive $20 million renovation directed by Chicago architect Gunny Harboe, whose restoration work included Loop landmarks the Rookery Building and Reliance Building. The project included restoration of the main lobby to emphasize the design features of the art deco era, elevator modernization, façade renovation and cleaning, and the continued renovation of upper floor corridors and hallways. Though impractically small for modern use, mailboxes in the lobby were restored to their original condition to follow the theme of vertical lines found throughout the complex. An improved electrical infrastructure, with ten main feeds from seven different Commonwealth Edison electrical substations, was added in addition to redundant cooling systems and upgraded telecommunications capabilities. When the old CBOT building was demolished in 1929, two tall gray granite statues of classically styled goddesses were moved from the second floor ledge above the main entrance into the gardens of the estate of Arthur W. Cutten, a wheat and cotton speculator who went bankrupt during the Great Depression. One goddess represents agriculture and is shown standing with wheat and leaning on a cornucopia. The other represents industry and appears with the bow of a ship and an anvil. The statues were found in 1978 near Glen Ellyn, Illinois by the Forest Preserve District of DuPage County, on land acquired from Cutten's estate. After being displayed in a parking lot at Danada Forest Preserve for several years, both were returned to the CBOT building's plaza and rededicated on June 9, 2005. In September 2011, the intersection of LaSalle Street and Jackson Boulevard in front of the building became the headquarters for the Occupy Chicago protest movement. On April 23, 2013, the CME Group sold the north and south towers of the building at 141 W. Jackson Blvd. for $151.5 million to a joint venture between GlenStar Properties LLC and USAA Real Estate Co. The CME will retain ownership of the smaller east building at 333 S. LaSalle St. CME signed a 15-year lease for the it occupies in the two towers. Surroundings Chicago Board of Trade from the Willis Tower The LaSalle Street canyon is home to other historic buildings including the Rookery Building, a National Historic Landmark considered to be the oldest standing high-rise. A 1907 renovation included a lobby remodeled by Frank Lloyd Wright in the Prairie School style. The name rookery comes from the previous building on the property which became home to many birds, especially pigeons. The nearby Reliance Building was the first skyscraper to have large plate glass windows comprise the majority of its surface area, and One North LaSalle was for some time one of Chicago's tallest buildings. Both the Reliance Building and One North LaSalle are on the National Register of Historic Places. Since 1853, the governments of Chicago and Cook County have shared three different buildings at the north end of the canyon. The current Chicago City Hall, built in a Classical Revival style, was designed to symbolize the strength, dignity, and vigor of the government. Completed in 2001, an award-winning green roof was incorporated into the structure. All of the structures are designated as Chicago Landmarks. Other nearby buildings of note include the Continental Commercial National Bank, now called 208 South LaSalle Street, which broke records in 1911 as the city's most expensive development, with a cost exceeding $10 million. The Rand- McNally Building that had served as the headquarters of the World's Columbian Exposition was demolished to accommodate the structure. The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, at 230 South LaSalle Street, was built in a Greco-Roman style and contained the largest vaults in the world and one of the first building- wide wired communication systems. Both the Federal Reserve Bank and 208 South LaSalle demonstrate the popularity of neoclassical architecture during the late 19th and early 20th centuries and were meant to project a sense of financial security. One mile (1.6 km) west of Lake Michigan and in the southwest corner of the Loop, the building is near two elevated stations of the Chicago 'L'. The Quincy station is one block to the west and the LaSalle/VanBuren station is between the CBOT and the Chicago Stock Exchange; both stations are served by the Orange, Purple, Pink, and Brown Lines. Additionally, Blue Line service is provided at the Jackson and LaSalle stations, each two blocks away. Union Station stands five blocks to the west on Jackson Boulevard, providing terminal service for Amtrak and select service for Metra. Additional Metra service is provided at the LaSalle Street Station, two blocks due south. Tenants The CME Group occupied 33 percent of available space in 2006, while financial and trading concerns occupied 54 percent of the three-building complex. In addition to Ceres Cafe on the first floor of the lobby, other businesses provide banking, insurance, travel services, beauty services, and healthcare. Some business have been in the building for over 40 years, and throughout its history, commodities speculators, such as \\"Prince of the Pit\\" Richard Dennis, have maintained offices in the building. In 2007, the U.S. Futures Exchange, a competitor of the CBOT formerly known as Eurex US, announced a move from the Sears Tower into the 14th floor of the CBOT building. Originally built for the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), it became the primary trading venue for the derivatives exchange, the CME Group, formed in 2007 by the merger of the CBOT and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. In 2012, the CME Group sold the CBOT Building to a consortium of real estate investors, including GlenStar Properties LLC and USAA Real Estate Company. Visitors The CBOT building has been the site of a number of visits by dignitaries, including the Prince of Wales in October 1977. In 1991, George H. W. Bush became the first President of the United States to visit the Exchange, where he delivered a speech from the soybean pit regarding the importance of agriculture to the American economy. A visit from former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev followed on May 7, 1992. In 2006, former US President Jimmy Carter and wife Rosalyn toured the CBOT while campaigning for their son Jack's run for a U.S. Senate seat from Nevada. During the 1996 Democratic National Convention, US Vice President Al Gore was hosted at the Exchange's Democratic Senatorial Campaign reception. When US President George W. Bush toured the agricultural trading floor on January 6, 2006, he was hailed from the corn trading pit with \\"Hook 'em, Horns!\\", a reference to his adopted home state of Texas. Interest groups such as the Chicago Architecture Foundation and Inside Chicago Walking Tours provide scheduled tours showcasing the architecture and selected portions of the trading operations. Awards and honors * 1985: the 23-story addition won the Best Structure Award from the Structural Engineers Association of Illinois. * 2006: the building was awarded the Landmarks Illinois' annual Real Estate and Building Industries Council award for its preservation efforts. * 2006: the Building Owners and Managers Association of Chicago presented the CBOT building with The Office Building of the Year award recognizing the high quality of office space and excellence in management of the building. In popular culture The 1885 building and trading pits were prominently featured in The Pit, the second novel by Frank Norris in The Epic of the Wheat trilogy. Life on the trading floor of the Chicago Board of Trade is detailed in the nonfiction book Leg the Spread by Cari Lynn (2004).Lynn, CAri Leg The Spread: A Woman's Adventures Inside the Trillion-Dollar Boys Club of Commodities Trading (). Trading operations have been used as scenes in movies such as Ferris Bueller's Day Off, and the streetscape in the LaSalle Street canyon is used in the movies The Untouchables, Road to Perdition, and Transformers: Dark of the Moon. In Batman Begins, the Board of Trade Building represents the headquarters of Wayne Enterprises, but in the 2008 sequel, The Dark Knight, Wayne Enterprises was represented by the Richard J. Daley Center. The building itself appears in The Dark Knight. WCIU-TV broadcasts First Business with news of the Chicago Board of Trade. Former WVON-AM radio personality Don Cornelius began the popular dance show Soul Train in a cramped studio on the 43rd floor in 1970. When Cornelius moved the show to Los Angeles a year later, his assistant, Clinton Ghent took over the local show until it ended in 1976. Prior to Soul Train, shows filmed in the building were Kiddie A Go-Go, a dance show aimed at the pre-teen market which premiered in 1965 and Red Hot and Blues, a teen dance show hosted by local DJ Big Bill Hill which premiered in 1967. More recently, the building's interior and exterior portrayed the offices of the Daily Planet newspaper in the 2013 Superman reboot film, Man of Steel. Although depicted with the tower in a Rand McNally map from 1893, later lithographs of the first 141 Jackson Street location display a red-roofed building without a tower. Memorabilia of the current building is abundant, with postcards of panoramic scenes from LaSalle Street, the clock, and lighted upper decks having been produced for decades. In views from the Museum Campus, the building's crown is framed by the middle floors of the taller Sears Tower in the background. Photographer Andreas Gursky has used the location for still life prints such as 1997's Chicago Board of Trade, I and 1999's Chicago Board of Trade, II. A photograph of the exterior, from the Museum series by Thomas Struth, is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. An often-reproduced painting by Leslie Ragan for the New York Central Railroad depicts streamliner locomotives idling at LaSalle Street Station with the Board of Trade Building looming prominently in the background. At 1211 North LaSalle Street on the city's Near North Side, a 16-story apartment hotel built in 1929 and converted into an apartment building in 1981 was used by muralist Richard Haas for trompe-l'œil murals in homage to Chicago School architecture.

After signing with Avex Trax, Nakamura released her debut single, \\"Yogoreta Shitagi\\" in 2006. She attracted public attention after coming out as transgender woman publicly via her official website on 11 September 2006. Nakamura's second single \\"Tomodachi no Uta\\", which details her struggling with the sexuality and unrequited love for her friend, became her breakthrough hit, reaching number nine in Japan. Her debut studio album, Ten Made Todoke, was released in January 2007 and certificated Gold by Recording Industry Association of Japan. Her fourth studio album Shōnen Shōjo (2010) won the 52nd Japan Record Awards for Excellence Album Award. In May 2011, Nakamura released her first compilation album, Wakage no Itari. Early life Ataru Nakamura was born on 28 June 1985, in Sumida, Tokyo. Her parents divorced when she was little, and she was raised by her mother. Nakamura began studying music early in her life, teaching herself to play the piano at the age of ten, and beginning to write her own songs at fifteen. Music career=2004–2005: Switch to Avex Trax and Ten Made Todoke era In 2006, she switched to a major label, the popular Avex Trax. Her first major label single, \\"Yogoreta Shitagi\\", was released on her birthday, and received minor attention. \\"Yogoreta Shitagi\\" was written about an ex-boyfriend who was cheating on her and is written from the former boyfriend's point of view. Nakamura called this individual on the telephone to explain that the song she had written about him was to be her debut single. Her second single, \\"Tomodachi no Uta\\", received greater attention, and placed at number 150 on the Oricon charts. However, it was not until Nakamura came out as a transgender female that she received major attention. Her explanation garnered a lot of media attention, and her single rose to number 9 on the Oricon charts. \\"Tomodachi no Uta\\" became the theme song for the popular television drama Watashi ga Watashi de Aru Tame ni, a primetime television drama about a young transsexual woman. Nakamura even received a small cameo appearance on the program. Nakamura wrote \\"Tomodachi no Uta\\" when she was fourteen years old; notably, it was the first song she ever wrote. She wrote the song to say goodbye to the friends in junior high she would never see again. \\"Tomodachi no Uta\\" was featured in an Avex Trax musical titled \\"Kokoro no Kakera\\". The soundtrack featured 21 songs chosen from the company's hits over the past two decades. Her third single, \\"Watashi no Naka no Ii Onna\\", entered the Oricon charts at number 39. On the same day \\"Watashi no Naka no Ii Onna\\" was released, the song \\"Chewing Gum\\" written by Nakamura for the band AAA, debuted on the Oricon chart. Her two songs competed with one another for four weeks. Her first album, Ten Made Todoke, was released on 1 January 2007. A month later, she released \\"Kaze ni Naru\\", her fourth single. \\"Kaze ni Naru\\" was the theme song for the film Sakebi. Her song \\"Kakeashi no Ikizama\\" was used as the closing theme for the anime series Reideen. Late 2007–2008: Watashi wo Daite Kudasai era Nakamura's fifth single marked the promotion of her second album titled Watashi wo Daite Kudasai. The album was released on 5 December 2007. \\"Ringo Uri\\", the album's first single, premiered on 27 June 2007, and peaked at number 30 on the Oricon charts. The album's second single, \\"Hadaka Denkyū\\", premiered on 21 November. \\"Tori no Mure\\", the album's third single and her seventh overall, received minor airplay. 2009: Ashita wa Haremasu You Ni era \\"Kaze Tachinu\\" debuted on 9 July 2008. The song was used as the theme song for the live-action film GeGeGe no Kitaro Sennen Noroi Uta. The single did well and was received much like \\"Tomodachi no Uta\\". Nakamura appeared at AP Bank Fes' 08, a musical festival, on 20 July 2008, to promote the single.

Using fatwood lighters while working in Olaus Magnus' Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus 1555 Fatwood holder made of clay with fatwood stump, lower Rhine area, Germany, 18th or 19th century Holder for kindling stick, Källsjö parish, Halland – Nordiska museet, Stockholm Fatwood, also known as \\"fat lighter\\", \\"lighter wood\\", \\"rich lighter\\", \\"pine knot\\", \\"lighter knot\\", \\"heart pine\\" or \\"lighter'd\\", is derived from the heartwood of pine trees. The stump (and tap root) that is left in the ground after a tree has fallen or has been cut is the primary source of fatwood, as the resin-impregnated heartwood becomes hard and rot-resistant over time after the death of the main tree. Other locations, such as the joints where limbs intersect the trunk, can also be harvested. Although most resinous pines can produce fatwood, in the southeastern United States the wood is commonly associated with longleaf pine (Pinus palustris), which historically was highly valued for its high pitch production. History The commercial use of fatwood from stumps stemmed from the production of pitch and pine tar. In 1648, a company was formed in Sweden called Norrländska Tjärkompaniet (The Wood Tar Company of North Sweden), and was given exclusive export rights for pine tar by the King of Sweden. Composition Coniferous tree sap is a viscous liquid, that contains terpene, a volatile hydrocarbon. Over time the evaporation of the terpene changes the state of the sap; it slowly gets thicker until it hardens into resin. New fatwood leaks the sticky sap, while in aged fatwood the sap has hardened and is no longer sticky. At every stage of the aging process, fatwood will burn readily, unless excessively damp. Wood kindling and tinder Because of the flammability of terpene, fatwood is prized for use as kindling in starting fires. It lights quickly even when wet, is very wind resistant, and burns hot enough to light larger pieces of wood. A small piece of fatwood can be used many times to create tinder by shaving small curls and using them to light other larger tinder. The pitch-soaked wood produces an oily, sooty smoke, and it is recommended that one should not cook on a fire until all the fatwood has completely burned out. Distribution There are between 105 and 125 species classified as resinous pine trees around the world. Species usable for fatwood are distributed across a range including Eurasia, where they range from the Canary Islands, Iberian Peninsula and Scotland east to the Russian Far East. From the Philippines, Norway, Finland and Sweden (Scots Pine), and eastern Siberia (Siberian Dwarf Pine), and south to northernmost Africa. From the Himalaya and Southeast Asia, with one species (Sumatran Pine) just crossing the Equator in Sumatra. In North America, they range from 66°N in Canada (Jack Pine), to Central America to 12°N in Nicaragua (Caribbean Pine). The highest diversity in the genus occurs in Mexico and California. In the sub-tropics of the Southern Hemisphere, including Chile, Brazil, South Africa, Australia, Argentina and New Zealand, the trees are not indigenous but were introduced. Anywhere there is a pine tree or pine stump, there can be fatwood that can be found on top of the ground, but it is more concentrated and preserved in stumps. The United States In the United States the pine tree, Pinus palustris, known as the longleaf pine, once covered as much as but due to clear cutting was reduced by between 95% and 97%. The trees grow very large (up to 150 feet), taking 100 to 150 years to mature and can live up to 500 years. The wood was prized and cutting resulted in many hundreds of thousands of stumps that are very resinous, do not rot, and eventually become fatwood. This ushered in a new industry for many years. There is still a market for the wood, but supplies are less abundant. Due to the length of growing time, the Pinus taeda, also called the loblolly pine, replaced it for commercial replanting, with a maturity of only 38 to 45 years. Industrial uses Industrial uses for fatwood include production of turpentine; when fatwood is cooked down in a fire kiln, the heavier resin product that results is pine tar. The steam that vaporizes from this process is turned into a liquid that becomes turpentine. Other uses Tree resins or by-products are used in many different things to include; *Household chemicals especially for cleaning such as turpentine and pine oil. *Nail polish *medical to include dental *Cutler's resin is still used in making knife handles.

Overview  Founded by Cezar Petrescu and D. I. Cucu in the city of Cluj, and first issued on May 1, 1921 as a literary supplement for the Cluj-based Voinţa,Grigorescu, p.432-433; Livezeanu, p.112 it was originally a modernist and expressionist-influenced journal. During its early existence, it attracted criticism from the traditional cultural establishment for allegedly allowing influences from Germanic Europe to permeate Romanian culture. Gândirea moved to Bucharest in October 1922, and, in 1926, its leadership was joined by the nationalist thinker Nichifor Crainic; he became its director and ideological guide in 1928, gradually moving it toward a mystical Orthodox focus -- itself occasionally referred to as Gândirism. With just two interruptions in publication (1925 and 1933–34), Gândirea became one of the most important cultural magazines of the Romanian interwar period. A proponent of home-grown traditionalist ideas, it eventually found itself in opposition to Sburătorul, the modernist magazine headed by literary critic Eugen Lovinescu, as well as to the journal Viaţa Românească, which stood for the left-wing and agrarian current known as Poporanism. In its later years, Gândirea routinely hosted fascist-inspired and antisemitic articles, largely reflecting Crainic's own political views. By then, numerous disputes were taking place between Crainic's supporters and former Gândirea collaborators such as literary critic Tudor Vianu and poet Tudor Arghezi. Additional debates were carried between Crainic and the centrist political figures Nicolae Iorga and Constantin Rădulescu-Motru over the nature of nationalism and religion in Romania. The magazine often identified its secularist adversaries with materialism, and occasionally accused modernist figures in Romanian literature of writing pornography. Gândirea was briefly closed down over suspicions that it was supporting the fascist Iron Guard, and, between 1938 and 1944, endorsed the successive dictatorial regimes of the National Renaissance Front, the National Legionary State, and Conducător Ion Antonescu. During World War II, it expressed support for Antonescu's antisemitic policies, which Crainic claimed to have inspired. Together with all other publications Crainic was heading, Gândirea ceased to be published in 1944, as Romania ended its alliance with the Axis Powers. Contributors Several circles were formed around Gândirea, bringing together a large part of the period's Romanian intellectuals: Ion Barbu, Vasile Băncilă, Lucian Blaga, Dan Botta, Alexandru Busuioceanu, Mateiu Caragiale, Vasile Ciocâlteu, Oscar Walter Cisek, Anastase Demian, Radu Gyr, N. I. Herescu, Vintilă Horia, Adrian Maniu, Gib Mihăescu, Tiberiu Moşoiu, Ştefan I. Neniţescu, Ovidiu Papadima, Victor Papilian, Ioan Petrovici, Ion Pillat, V. I. Popa, Dragoş Protopopescu, Ion Marin Sadoveanu, Ion Sân-Giorgiu, Zaharia Stancu, Dumitru Stăniloae, Paul Sterian, Francisc Şirato, Al. O. Teodoreanu, Ionel Teodoreanu, Sandu Tudor, Tudor Vianu, Pan M. Vizirescu, Vasile Voiculescu, G. M. Zamfirescu. Many other intellectuals and artists had their work published in Gândirea, and some of them were only temporarily associated with the journal. They include Tudor Arghezi, George Călinescu, Şerban Cioculescu, Petre Pandrea, Mircea Eliade, Emil Cioran, Marcel Janco, Ion Vinea, and Mircea Vulcănescu. History=Beginnings For much of the 1920s, the magazine was a venue for modernist criticism, and involved in theoretical debates over the influence of German- and Austrian-influenced Expressionism on early 20th century culture. Gândirea's early years coincided with the aftermath of World War I and the establishment of Greater Romania, making the magazine one of several newly established Romanian-language periodicals in the formerly Austro-Hungarian region of Transylvania. It has thus been argued that, before moving to Bucharest, the magazine was also involved in promoting a unitary Romanian culture inside the newly acquired province, but this appears to have been one of its secondary goals.Livezeanu, p.112 Without producing its own an artistic program,Grigorescu, p.375 Gândirea counted among the few Romanian publications to praise Expressionist culture (its editors often extended the term to non-Expressionists such as Constantin Brâncuși, Max Reinhardt, Alexander Archipenko, and Dmitry Merezhkovsky).Grigorescu, p.375, 381-382 This focus on emotion and expression was especially present in essays contributed by Adrian Maniu and Ion Sân- Giorgiu,Grigorescu, p.381-382 as well as in Ion Marin Sadoveanu's chronicles about the impact of Gothic traditions on early 20th century literature.Grigorescu, p.387 The Expressionist trend, accompanied by Gândirea's frequent and sympathetic reviews of Futurism and Dada, caused Crainic (who was only a correspondent at the time), to express his distaste.Livezeanu, p. 114 Despite hosting a large number of essays on art criticism, and in contrast to the style of avant-garde journals such as Contimporanul,Grigorescu, p. 432 Gândirea rarely featured Expressionist graphics.Grigorescu, pp. 432-433 Notably, in 1924, the editors chose to illustrate an issue with a print by the proto-Expressionist Edvard Munch, commented upon by Tudor Vianu.Grigorescu, p. 433 Nevertheless, later in the same year, painter Francisc Şirato used Gândirea as a means to popularize his essays on Visual Arts in Romania, in which he publicized his break with Expressionist influences and his newfound interest in Romanian specificity in local art and folklore.Grigorescu, p.433-434 In parallel, Oskar Walter Cisek's art chronicle (published between 1923 and 1929), gave, overall, equal exposure to all existing modernist trends.Grigorescu, pp. 434-435 Literature produced by the first of several Gândirea circles received criticism from several traditionalist circles for being one of \\"sick modernists\\".Rendered in Livezeanu, p. 111 Notably, the historian and politician Nicolae Iorga, one of the major cultural figures of his time, cited fears that Romania was becoming \\"Germanized\\".Iorga, in Grigorescu, p. 376 He argued that, aside from Crainic's poetry it published, the magazine was copying Germanic ideals originating with the art groups of Munich and Vienna (\\"[Gândirea is] the window copy of modernist jargon muttered by Munich only to be responded through other parrotings, insane or charlatanesque, by Vienna\\").Iorga, in Grigorescu, p. 377 By that moment, however, the magazine was itself fusing Expressionist influences with traditionalist aesthetic goals, to the point where it had become, according to Lucian Blaga, \\"a bouquet of centrifugal tendencies\\".Blaga, in Grigorescu, p.380; in Livezeanu, p.125 During the 1920s, Gândirea hosted polemical articles by the traditionalists and traditionalist- inspired Iorga, Crainic, Cezar Petrescu, and Pamfil Şeicaru.Livezeanu, p.115 Writing much later, Crainic expressed his opinion that the two visions were only apparently contradictory: > \\"Expressionism in painting is a German fatality. But from [Germany] it has > migrated towards us as well. [...] Have the poetry of Blaga and Adrian > Maniu, the theater of Blaga, Maniu, lost their ethnic (and therefore > traditional) specificity for having borrowed the expressionist style from > wherever?\\"Crainic, in Grigorescu, p. 378 Reviewing the emphasis of traditionalism subsequently present in Gândirea's pages, the critic Ovid Crohmălniceanu argued that it was no less an evidence of a new kind of literature.Crohmălniceanu, in Livezeanu, p.111 Although the main proponent of traditionalism, Crainic himself remained open to some modernist influences, and translated the innovative works of Rainer Maria Rilke into Romanian.Livezeanu, p.118 Early conflicts From the late 1920s and over much of its existence, Crainic's press engaged in polemics with modernists of the Eugen Lovinescu school, which at times turned into accusations that Lovinescu was \\"a petty poser\\" and \\"a falsifier of Romanian culture\\".Sfarmă-Piatră, in Ornea, p.439 Crainic and his traditionalist followers rejected Lovinescu's views on local \\"synchronism\\" with Western culture.Maier; Ornea, pp. 23-26, 438-441; Pop Their attitude in regard to the latter has drawn comparisons with Protochronist messages in Communist Romania, both claiming the superiority and primacy of Romanian culture over its Western counterparts.Maier Although Crainic publicized his thoughts on the matter mainly through his other periodical, Sfarmă-Piatră, Gândirea notably hosted a 1926 article in which he likened the fight against Lovinescu's influence to \\"a second independence [of Romania]\\".Crainic, in Livezeanu, p. 123; in Maier During the 1930s, Gândirea was at the center of virulent polemics involving, on one side, former contributors such as Tudor Arghezi and Tudor Vianu, and, on the other, those younger journalists who recognized Crainic as their mentor. Initially, this took the form of a Gândirist critique of both Modernism and the socialist-inspired current known as Poporanism: in a 1930 article for Gândirea, Crainic notably indicated his distaste for \\"the irremediable materialism\\" he believed to be professed by the rival Viaţa Românească.Crainic, in Ornea, p. 77 Following this, Vianu, whose political options contrasted with the new trend, chose to discontinue his contributions and joined the staff at Viaţa Românească;Ornea, pp. 116-117 although Lucian Blaga shared some views with Crainic, he too decided to distance himself from the magazine as early as 1930 (writing to Vianu that he did not consider himself a \\"disciple of our common friend Nichifor's Orthodoxy\\").Blaga, in Ornea, p. 116; see also Vasilache Crainic's impact Religious painting by Sabin Popp, an artist whose work was praised by the traditionalists at Gândirea In December 1931, as the magazine celebrated its first decade, Crainic summed up Gândirea's guidelines, stressing that its commitment to Orthodoxy, the Romanian monarchy and nationalism: > \\"[...] set apart a person from our generation from a thousand others -- > [these] are nothing other than absolutely necessary conditions which make > possible the true spiritual life. [...] This is what our precursors cannot > comprehend, [being] a sad generation liquidating a culture that was not > theirs and through this was not even cultural.\\"Crainic, in Ornea, p.95 The Viaţa Românească columnist George Călinescu was skeptical of Crainic's politics, and noted his alternation between various nationalist camps. Commenting on Gândirea's choice to support Carol II at the time when he replaced his son Mihai I as king (1930), he likened Crainic to Judas Iscariot: > \\"[Crainic is] a person incapable of any privation, seeker of pieces of > silver and worldly pleasures, great seeker of noisy shindings where pistols > are being fired, a cajoler and a careerist, outrageously dedicating Gândirea > today to HRM Mihai, tomorrow to HRM Carol II, the day after tomorrow to the > great apostle of the nation Nicolae Iorga, at any moment when the homage > could be tied to the pursuit of a personal interest.\\"Călinescu, in Ornea, p. > 264 At the time, Gândirism owed inspiration to Russian émigré authors, both Orthodox traditionalists such as Nikolai Berdyaev and several advocates of the nationalist and mystical Eurasianist trend (Nikolai Trubetzkoy, Pyotr Savitsky, Pyotr Alexeyev, and Ivan Ilyin).Veiga, p. 169 Around 1934, Crainic reflected upon the connection his magazine had with other traditionalist cultural institutions, and concluded that his group was fulfilling the legacy of the more secular but equally traditionalist magazine Sămănătorul (\\"Over the land that we have learned to love from Sămănătorul we see arching itself the azure tarpaulin of the Orthodox Church. We see this substance of this Church blending in with the ethnic substance.\\")Crainic, in Ornea, p. 102; in Veiga, p. 169 More than a decade later, Călinescu argued that an enduring trait of Gândirism (to which he referred as Orthodoxism) had been a manifest belief in miracles. He believed to have noticed this in the works of Gândirea contributors such as Mircea Vulcănescu (in his homage to the deceased painter Sabin Popp, whom he allegedly regarded as \\"a saint\\"), Vasile Ciocâlteu (\\"who asks from God, in one of his poems, the favor to hold hot coals in his hands\\") and the Athonite pilgrim Sandu Tudor (who believed in \\"the workings of a mysterious miracle\\" as explanations for various events).Călinescu, Compendiu..., p.356 In his later columns for Gândirea, Crainic focused on explaining his ideal of ethnocracy in connection with the magazine's overall goals.Ornea, p.100-101 This involved the denunciation of \\"foreign elements\\" and \\"minority islands\\", with a specific focus on the Jewish-Romanian community (\\"Jews make use of an indolent hospitality in order to deprive our kin of its ancient patrimony\\")Crainic, in Ornea, p.100-101 and its alleged connections with the political establishment (\\"In statements, in speeches and in acts of government our democrats have always declared themselves on the side of intruders and the allogeneous\\").Crainic, in Ornea, p.101 According to Călinescu, Crainic, unlike the regime in Nazi Germany, was not condoning racism as much as religious antisemitism: > \\"For reasons of churchly policy, the race factor is averted and [Crainic] > takes a stand against [racism in Nazi Germany] and those nationalists who > advocate the elimination of Christianized Jews and deny them baptism. 'The > Church is open to all'. Although it is not said outright, it is understood > that a baptized Jew becomes a Romanian, Nation and Religion being correlated > notions. [...] Gândirea has thus received plenty of rallied, that is to say > Orthodoxized, Jews.\\"Călinescu, Compendiu..., p.362 In parallel, around 1931, the magazine's approach to philosophy was criticized by the Personalist thinker Constantin Rădulescu-Motru, who deemed it \\"belletristic\\"; the traditionalist philosopher Mircea Vulcănescu, although himself only occasionally associated with Gândirea, defended Crainic's influence in front of the pragmatic conservative Junimist tradition arguably represented by Rădulescu-Motru inside the University of Bucharest.Ornea, p.78-79, 180-181 Writing in 1937, Crainic celebrated Gândirea's role in making nationalism and Orthodoxy priorities in Romania's intellectual and political life: > \\"The term 'ethnic' with its meaning of 'ethnic specificity' imprinted in all > sorts of expressions of the people, as a mark of its original properties, > has been spread for 16 years by the journal Gândirea. The same thing applies > to the terms of autochthonism, traditionalism, Orthodoxy, spirituality and > many more which became the shared values of our current nationalist > language.\\"Crainic, in Caraiani, note 23 1934 hiatus and recovery A scandal erupted in 1934, when the magazine was closed down over Crainic's implication in the trial of Premier Ion G. Duca's assassins, all of them members of the fascist Iron Guard (a movement to which Crainic was close at the time).Ornea, p.99; Veiga, p.169, 253, 255; see also Livezeanu, p.118 Instigation of the killing was attributed to, among others, Crainic, who faced trial; Gândirea, like Calendarul (his other major journal), was closed down by the authorities.Ornea, p.99, 230-231, 298, 300 The editor was eventually acquitted, but Calendarul was never allowed to resume print.Ornea, p.244-245 Instead, Crainic focused his energy on issuing Sfarmă-Piatră.Ornea, p.245 Following its reemergence, Gândirea was again involved in a debate with Rădulescu-Motru. Among others, the latter contended that the Gândirist focus on Orthodoxy clashed with the traditional openness Romanian nationalism (which he referred to as Romanianism) had towards modernization, equating Crainic's thought with \\"xenophobia\\" and \\"nationalist patter\\".Rădulescu-Motru, in Ornea, p.121, 123 In response, Crainic accused Rădulescu-Motru of displaying \\"a Masonic aversion towards Orthodoxy\\",Crainic, in Ornea, p.124 and of not having grasped the sense of spirituality (to the statement \\"Romanianism is a spirituality coming to justify a realist order\\",Rădulescu-Motru, in Ornea, p.122 he replied \\"Any man knows that the word spirituality has a strictly religious meaning\\"). Later, he defined Rădulescu-Motru's thought as \\"militant philosophical atheism\\",Crainic, in Ornea, p.125 and, in a Gândirea article of 1937, referred to him as a \\"philosophic simpleton [găgăuţ]\\".Crainic, in Ornea, p.456 As early as April 1933, Crainic wrote articles welcoming Adolf Hitler's rise to power in Germany,Ornea, p.253-255, 414 and began support for corporatist goals.Ornea, p.253-255; Pop Four years later, he authored a Gândirea article in which he praised Benito Mussolini and Italian fascism as the most adequate authoritarian alternative to positivism, materialism, capitalism and socialism alike: > \\"[Fascism is] a spiritual political concept [whose] manifestations, torn > away from the tight circle of positivism and freed from the suffocating > prison of materialism, fall into order on the ghostly marrow of history, > prolonging themselves into the recess of past centuries and into the > anticipations of the coming century. [...] A man bears there, under his vast > dome-like forehead, our European century: Benito Mussolini. [...] The State > created by Mussolini is the exemplary State. [...] Fascism is no longer > capitalism, no longer socialism, but an authoritarian adjustment of every > factor in production, geared into a social organism where nothing is left to > chance. [...] More than any other country, Romania needs such a moral > transformation in the depths of its soul [...] the spirit of a new Rome will > suggest the shape of history destined to be created by a nationalist > Romania.\\"Crainic, in Ornea, p.251-252 This coincided with friendly relations between Crainic and the Italian Comitati d'azione per l'universalità di Roma (CAUR, the \\"Fascist International\\"), first evidenced in 1933-1934, at a time when Mussolini was undecided over the local political movement which was to attract his support.Veiga, p.252-253 CAUR was planning to advance Crainic money to start a new publication, entirely dedicated to support for the Italian model, but the design was abandoned when Ugo Sola, the Italian ambassador in Bucharest, advised against it (Sola had been refused by the Iron Guard when approaching them with a similar proposal).Veiga, p.253 As CAUR ended its all its relations with the Guard (who opted instead in favor of Nazi backing), it kept its contacts with Crainic and other less revolutionary-minded Romanian politicians -- Mihail Manoilescu, Alexandru Averescu, Nicolae Iorga, Alexandru Vaida- Voevod, Octavian Goga and A. C. Cuza. In 1935, Crainic, who had been a vice president of Cuza's National-Christian Defense League, joined the fascist National Christian Party, but split with it after his ethnocratic ideal was dismissed by older party politicians (1937).Ornea, p.255-262 Writing in 1938 for his Porunca Vremii, Crainic argued: > \\"There exists authority based on love. The latter is Mussolini's authority > over his people. It bursts out of the characteristic forces of the creative > personality, like fire provoked by exploding bombs. Mussolini does not > terrorize, for Mussolini does not kill. Mussolini attracts. [...] All his > system is based on the fervent and unanimous adherence of his > people.\\"Crainic, in Ornea, p.253 Late 1930s polemics After Emil Cioran published his The Transfiguration of Romania in 1937, Crainic reacted to the book's pro-totalitarian but overtly skeptic message, calling it \\"a bloody, merciless, massacre of today's Romania, without even [the fear] of matricide and sacrilege\\".Crainic, in Ornea, p.143 To Cioran's support for modernization on a model which owed inspiration to both Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, as well as to his criticism of Romanian traditions, Crainic replied by urging young people in general not to abandon \\"faith in our kin's rising century\\". In early 1938, Nicolae Iorga, who had by then come into open conflict with the Iron Guard, voiced criticism of Cuvântul (a paper associated with the latter political movement), arguing that, despite an emphasis on traditionalism and localism, its ideological guidelines took direct inspiration from the foreign models of Nazism and Italian fascism.Ornea, p.98 The dispute, involving, on the other side, Nae Ionescu, drew echoes in Gândirea -- also challenged by Vulcănescu's argument that Gândirea had failed in their attempt to identify with Orthodoxy, Crainic polemized that Gândirism was in fact opposed to all forms of leftist and rightist internationalism (the \\"internationalist currents dominating our age\\").Crainic, in Ornea, p.99 At the time, publications headed by Ionescu and Crainic, despite maintaining separate visions on several core issues, showed equal support for a number of ideas (up to a certain point, Crainic was a direct influence on Ionescu).Vasilache Iorga and Crainic had come to clash over Crainic's emphasis on religion (in front of Iorga's secularism), his political choices, as well as the few links Crainic still maintained with modernism.Livezeanu, p.118-122 Similar criticism of Crainic's political influence on Gândirea was voiced, in retrospect, by Pamfil Şeicaru (himself connected with the Iron Guard for part of his life).Ornea, p.113 Şeicaru believed that the magazine aimed to adapt the influential ideas of Roman Catholic political activism (the Catholic Action) to an Orthodox environment: \\"[Crainic's] Orthodoxism was meant to facilitate the establishment of a party similar to the Democatholic ones\\".Şeicaru, in Ornea, p.107, 242 He also argued that > \\"A political-Orthodox movement crystallized inside a party is destined to be > a vain attempt, no matter how much talent N. Crainic may have. And a > political ambition is not enough in creating a large-scale social movement. > Hence the deviation of Gândirea magazine from its initial impulse.\\"Şeicaru, > in Ornea, p.107 The magazine's articles featured accusations that Tudor Arghezi's group, together with others writers, was condoning \\"pornography\\",Ornea, p.448 and Gândirea sided with Iorga's similar views on Arghezi's work.Ornea, p.456 In this context, Crainic and his collaborators included antisemitic texts in Gândirea's columns.Ornea, p.36, 69-70, 448, 456 At the time, through the voice of Crainic, the magazine hailed Nazi Germany for having \\"immediately thrown over the border all Judaic pornographers and even those German writers infected with Judaism\\", and Fascist Italy for \\"immediately sanctioning a scabrous short story writer\\". 1940s Eventually, Crainic rallied with King Carol II's National Renaissance Front (FRN) and the authoritarian cabinet of Ion Gigurtu, inspiring the drafting antisemitic legislation,Ornea, p.397 and being appointed to the leadership of the Propaganda Ministry. Despite the violent conflict between Carol and the Iron Guard, he continued to be ambivalent towards the latter, especially after the FRN was confronted with the Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and the Second Vienna Award;Ornea, p.328, 379-380 Crainic allowed its activists to broadcast their anthem on public radio, carrying on as minister during the World War II Iron Guard government (the National Legionary State).Ornea, p.328 In 1941, celebrating twenty years of existence, Gândirea hosted Crainic's thoughts on the \\"Jewish Question\\" and the new authoritarian and antisemitic regime of Ion Antonescu, which it had come to support:Final Report, p.92; Livezeanu, p.118 > \\"Throughout this time [...], Judaism was our most bitter enemy. Not an > adversary, but an enemy [...]. Today, Judaism is vanquished. A splendid act > of justice has suppressed [the left-wing publications] Adevărul, Dimineaţa > and Lupta. The rest, it was only in 1940 that I could carry out when, as > Minister of Propaganda, I extirpated all Jewish daily and weekly > publications in Romania. The holy right of speaking in the name of > Romanianism belongs now to Romanians exclusively. [...] There shall be no > more artistic and cultural ideals where Judaism could dissimulate > itself.\\"Crainic, in Ornea, p.402; alternative translation in Final Report, > p.92 Following the recovery of Bessarabia during Operation Barbarossa, Gândirea joined the group of magazines that were blaming the territory's original loss on the Bessarabian Jewish community, while Crainic identified past and present Soviet policies with Judeo-Bolshevism.Final Report, p.96 Disestablishment and legacy The magazine ceased publication in 1944, after the August 23 Coup overthrew Antonescu and the Soviet Red Army entered Romania (see Soviet occupation of Romania). In May 1945, Crainic was tried in absentia by a Communist Party-dominated People's Tribunal, as part of the \\"fascist journalists' group\\" (alongside Pamfil Şeicaru, Stelian Popescu, Grigore Manoilescu, and Radu Gyr).Ţiu He was charged with instigating racial hatred, endorsing the war against the Soviet Union, and helping to keep secret the war crimes of the Antonescu regime. Found guilty, Crainic was sentenced to life imprisonment and hard labor (captured in 1947, he was to serve 15 years in the prisons of Communist Romania). In a poll of 102 Romanian literary critics conducted in 2001 by the literary magazine Observator Cultural, the novel Craii de Curtea-Veche, written by Mateiu Caragiale and published in Gândirea in 1926-1927, was chosen \\"best Romanian novel of the twentieth century\\".

Early life Paul-Louis Simond was born in Beaufort-sur-Gervanne, (Drome, France) on 30 July 1858. His father was a pastor of the Reformed Church. From 1878 to 1882 Simond was an assistant in Medical and Biological Sciences at the School of Medicine and Pharmacy in Bordeaux, and he began his medical training there. From 1882 to 1886 he served as director of a leprosarium near Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni, French Guiana, where he contracted an attenuated form of yellow fever. He returned to Bordeaux in 1886 and the following year he received his medical doctorate with a prize-winning thesis on leprosy. Career Paul-Louis Simond injecting plague vaccine June 4th 1898 In 1895 he began work at the Pasteur Institute in Paris and while working in the laboratory of Elie Metchnikoff, he was the first to provide a comprehensive description of the sexual reproductive processes of Coccidia. This work provided experimental support for the theory of evolutionary dimorphism which had been put forward by R. Pfeiffer. In 1897, when Alexandre Yersin was transferred by the Pasteur Institute to a post in Vietnam, his position in Bombay was filled by Simond, who was to test the efficacy of an experimental antiserum against the outbreak of plague in that city. The following year, Simond was in Karachi where, despite limited resources, he was able to demonstrate that fleas transmit the bacterium Yersinia pestis, the agent causing bubonic plague, from rat to rat, and from rat to human. His ingenious experiments are described in his report to the Pasteur Institute on the spread of plague (\\"La propagation de la peste\\"), which was published in 1898 by Pierre Paul Emile Roux in the Annales de l'Institut Pasteur. Marc Simond, Margaret L. Godley, and Pierre D.E. Mouriquand (1998). “Paul-Louis Simond and his discovery of plague transmission by rat fleas: A centenary” J. Roy. Soc. Med., 91, 101-104. For this work Simond was awarded the Barbier prize from the French Academy of Medicine. His findings were not initially accepted by the scientific community, but were validated later by others and by 1907 his conclusions were accepted as scientific fact. From 1898 to 1901 Simond served as director of the Pasteur Institute in Saigon organizing a modern vaccine service; he received the distinction of Knight of the Legion of Honour. From 1901 to 1905 he participated on a mission to study yellow fever in Brazil where he and his colleagues confirmed the results that the U.S. Army Commission led by Walter Reed had just obtained in Cuba. These revealed that the amaril virus is the pathogen present in the blood of patients, and that this virus can be conveyed to humans by the mosquito species, Stegomyia fasciata (later renamed Aedes aegypti). http://history.amedd.army.mil/booksdocs/misc/evprev/ch7.htm In 1908-09 he conducted yellow fever research in Martinique. From 1911 to 1913 he served as Director of the Imperial Bacteriology Research Institute in Constantinople. In 1917, Simond was installed in Valence to study tuberculosis. Simond also had a keen interest in botany; during his stay as a colonial doctor in Indochina from 1914 until 1917, he collected orchids and had a local artist create watercolor paintings of them. He amassed a collection of 226 watercolor paintings of 3,226 different species of orchids which were presented to the Phanerogamie of the Muséum national d'histoire naturelle on 1947. Death Paul-Louis Simond died in Valence (Drôme, France) on 3 March 1947 at the age 88. After his death, a fellow biologist, René Dujarric de la Rivière, presented Simond's eulogy at the Academy of Medecine. There is a street in Valence named after him.

It is located along Highway 105, north of Highway 17 and Vermilion Bay, about halfway between Highway 17 and Red Lake, or about northwest of Thunder Bay. Ear Falls is entirely surrounded by Unorganized Kenora District. The closest community to Ear Falls is Wabauskang First Nation, followed by the unincorporated community of Perrault Falls. Etymology There are different versions of how the settlement was named after the eponymous falls. The following are three versions of the story found in the museum archives: # Ear Falls was once known as Otahwaka Powitek to the Ojibwa band. This area was believed to be haunted by the spirit of a giant beaver which lived between the upper and lower falls. It was said that when the beaver was swimming, its ears could be seen rising and falling in the foaming water. # Legends have produced the names of many local spots, and one such name is Ear Falls. According to information provided by Gerald Bannatyne, a collector of artifacts, aboriginal people living on Goose Island were travelling past the rapids which are now known as Ear Falls, when they saw something that frightened them. They brought more men back with them to investigate. The 'monster' turned out to be a large tree root stuck in the rocks. The spot became known as 'Big Ear', which later became 'Ear Falls'. # Many, many years ago, local aboriginals had named Ear Falls Otahwaka Powitek because the water had worn the rock ledge at the lip of the falls roughly in the shape of a human ear. The early French fur traders' name for the falls was Portage D'Oreille, or literally speaking, \\"carrying place of the ear\\". Upper Ear Falls, about 1.5 miles upstream, was drowned out when the lake level was raised some when the power dam came into operation, and nothing of it remains today except dangerous ripple rapids with a very strong current. History=Fur trade (1680–1880) The beginning of the 17th century marked the arrival of French explorers to Northwestern Ontario and the beginning of the fur trade. The fur trade would remain the predominant business in the North for the next 200 years. The Hudson's Bay Company and the North West Company were rivals for most of the fur trade era. In 1821 both companies united, and posts were set up in the Ear Falls area on Lac Seul and Red Lake. Remains of these posts could be seen along the lakes in the area until the 1920s when the construction of the Lac Seul Dam caused a rise in the water levels and the remnants of the fur trade were covered with water. The arrival of the railway in the 1880s began the decline of the fur trade. The Hudson's Bay Company shifted the focus of their posts to meet the needs of the new residents in the area: supplies for miners, lumbermen and settlers were sold at posts and stores in the Ear Falls area. The railway era (1880–1916) Following the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway between 1870 and 1885, geologist and surveyors mapped Northwestern Ontario. By 1923, the Canadian National Railway was extended through the boundary of West Patricia with two lines: The Grand Trunk Railway and the Canadian Northern Railway. The railway opened the area to the development of timber, fish and mineral resources. Development of Ear Falls did not occur immediately with the arrival of the railways as the lines were not close to the town, but occurred when the fur trade was altered as a result of the railway. Supplies were brought in and furs were taken out at the closest point to the rail. Warehouses were erected for shipping and receiving at Hudson (near Sioux Lookout). A steamer was placed on Lac Seul to enhance freight operations. Red Lake and Central Patricia gold developments (1925–present) The discovery of gold at Red Lake in 1925 initiated a rise in development throughout areas north of the railways. In the following years, thousands of claims were staked from Favorable Lake in the west to Pickle Lake in the east. Transportation routes, settlements and power supplies were developed to support the mining industry. It was the success of the gold mines which led to the shaping of the region's transportation, land use and settlements patterns. It was also the Red Lake Gold developments that provided incentive for settlers to locate to Ear Falls. The falls were located on the primary freight route from Hudson to Red Lake. A generating station was constructed by Ontario Hydro in order to supply power to the mines at Red Lake, which led to the creation of the Hydro colony at Ear Falls. By the 1930s, Ear Falls had replaced Goldpines as the main settlement in the area. When bush planes became more affordable to transport goods, Ear Falls became the jump off point to Red Lake. Hydro power development During the 1920s, the Federal Government considered proposals to regulate the water in the Winnipeg River. By constructing the dam at the head of Lac Seul, the lake would become a large reservoir, retaining the spring run-off for use by power developments downstream on both the English and Winnipeg River systems. Lower Ear Falls was the selected location for the Lac Seul dam. The construction of the dam at Ear Falls began in the spring of 1928, but not before camp buildings were constructed along the east side of the river. A coffer dam, two earth dikes, excavation and preparations of the foundations of the dam were also completed before construction began. The pouring of concrete commenced in November and work on the dam continued throughout the winter months. The conservation dam was an economical means to create a storage basis for power developments in both Ontario and Manitoba. The construction of the dam had a dramatic impact on the lake due to a rise in water levels. Upper Ear Falls was drowned out by the dam, and well known landforms around the lake disappeared under the water level. Ontario Hydro played an instrumental role in the development of Ear Falls. The company realized that many of its generating stations in Northern Ontario were situated in isolated areas. In order to retain operators for these plants, the company recognized that they would need to supply quality housing, schools, recreation halls, stores, hospitals and other buildings. The company also supplied provisions for water supply, electrical services, sewage disposal and fire protection. In 1937, a colony was constructed at Ear Falls. Ontario Power Generation constructed the Obishikokaang Waasiganikewigamig/Lac Seul Generating Station (GS) beginning its commercial operation on February 18, 2009. OPG and the Lac Seul First Nation have formed a historic partnership that will see the First Nation own 25 per cent of the station. The station has dual names. The Ojibway name, Obishikokaang Waasiganikewigamig, means \\"White Pine Narrows electricity generating building\\". White Pine Narrows is the original Ojibway name for the area where the station is located. The English name of the plant is Lac Seul GS. The Lac Seul GS is located adjacent to Ontario Power Generation’s (OPG) existing Ear Falls GS on the English River in Ear Falls. The facilities are located at the outlet of the Lac Seul reservoir on the English River. This station consists of one 12.5 MW double regulated pit turbine and will operate under a rated net head of 9.78 metres and flow of 139.45 cubic metre per second. It will use the excess water flow that has historically been passed by the existing Ear Falls GS. This water will now be used to generate clean, renewable energy. The combined nameplate capacity of the two facilities is 29.3 MW. The existing 4-unit Ear Falls GS was placed in service between 1930 and 1948. Each unit has two intakes. The Ear Falls GS powerhouse is connected to the 185-metre long Lac Seul Conservation Dam which is owned by the Province of Ontario and operated by OPG. The dam is used to regulate water levels and flows for the purposes of power production in Ontario and Manitoba. It is estimated these facilities will generate approximately 185,000 megawatt-hours of renewable energy per year. Mining and forestry revival (1945–present) During the Second World War, there was a 50% decline in the gold mining industry in the Patricia District. With the end of the war and the opening of Highway 105 in 1947, the mining industry in the region was renewed. Ear Falls was now linked by road to the Trans-Canada Highway and to Red Lake. At this time, the Chukuni Lumber Company was operating at Snake Falls. The operation consisted of a saw mill, a small box mill, and about a dozen houses lining the trail that ran through the lumber yards to the saw mill. The children of the workers were bussed to school in Ear Falls. By 1954, plans were made to move the mill operations to Ear Falls. The workers constructed houses north of the highway, along the hydro line. The Chukuni Lumber Company was eventually purchased by Colenso of Red Lake Road in 1968 and the Ear Falls sawmill operations were closed. Colenso was, in turn, sold to the Dryden Paper Company in 1972. In the early 1950s, ore deposits were discovered on Bruce Lake north of Ear Falls. In 1966 Stelco, an iron pelletizing plant, was developed in the area. The Canadian Northern Railway constructed a line to the mine which crossed highway 105 to the south of Ear Falls and the outlet of Lac Seul to the east of the dam. A new town site containing 100 residential units was developed in Ear Falls North of the dam. Today the mine is closed and the rail line has been abandoned. On May 14, 1998, the Ear Falls Sawmill opened to produce dimensional lumber (Premium, Stud, #3 & Btr, Economy; 2x3, 2x4, 2x6; 6' to 9' length). The sawmill is CSA certifiedhttp://www.csasfmforests.ca/ with a capacity of . The sawmill was built by Avenor Inc. and later sold to Weyerhaeuser, then to Domtar, and is now owned by Eacom Timber Corporation. The sawmill was operational from 1998 to 2009. There were intermittent closures in 2008, and was closed indefinitely in 2009 due to unfavourable market conditions. Eacom has announced a plan to reopen the sawmill with an anticipated start date in mid- to late- 2014. In 2013, EACOM and the local union, Unifor, signed an 8-year agreement from 2014 to 2022. The sawmill commenced operation in August 2014.http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/thunder- bay/eacom-timber-reopens-ear-falls-mill-ending-5-year-closure-1.2728131 Unifor estimates as many as 125 of its members will have work at the sawmill site and up to 175 more will be employed in log harvesting and hauling operation.http://thedrydenobserver.ca/2013/10/ear-fall-sawmill-opening- in-2014-for-real/ Tourism (1945–present) The construction of Highway 105 helped to introduce tourism to the area, with hunting and fishing camps constructed on lakeshore sites along the highway. It also provided access points to Lac Seul, Cedar River and Chukuni River. Ear Falls is a natural funnel for supplies and services, due to its location between Vermillion Bay and Red Lake and its waterway access points. A tourist camp was built around the former Hudson's Bay store at Goldpines. Camps were also operated at Little Canada and Snake Falls. Once the Ontario Hydro construction at Manitou Falls was completed and the lumber company had closed, the tourist industry became the economic mainstay of the Ear Falls community. Hunting and fishing have been a popular draw to the area for years, and more recently, eco-tourism has added an additional element to the tourism experience of Ear Falls.http://www.ear-falls.com/visit/ear-falls-history In 2019, the Township of Ear Falls, in coordination with Accommodation Facilities in the Tourism Sector, reviewed the option of implementing a Municipal Accommodation Tax in the municipality. Council has determined that the Municipal Accommodation Tax, as revenue tool, does not appear to be in the best interest of the community at large due to the relatively low level of revenue that would be generated and the increased costs to administer another form of taxation. Council determined that a Municipal Accommodation Tax will not be implemented for Ear Falls. https://ear-falls.com/wp- content/uploads/2019/10/October-8-2019-Minutes.pdf Demographics Historic populations: * Population in 2016: 995 * Population in 2011: 1,026 * Population in 2006: 1,153 * Population in 2001: 1,150 * Population in 1996: 1,170 ClimateServices Municipal building Ear Falls offers essential services and shopping for residents and tourists.

The company's CEO and other senior management maintain responsibility for day-to-day operational issues. Sponsors and other investors Various investor classes look to the financial sponsor to generate value in a company as much as the management or operations of the company. In particular, debt providers are willing to extend credit in the form of bank loans, high-yield debt and mezzanine capital based in part on the reputation of and relationship with the financial sponsor. Additionally, many companies owned by financial sponsors will raise equity in the public markets through an initial public offering or (IPO) as a means of exiting an investment. Public investors will seek to align their own interests as much as possible with those of the financial sponsor by limiting the financial sponsor's ability to sell shares and managing the use of proceeds from the offering.

A head saw, framesaw, gang saw or head rig is the saw that makes the initial cuts in a log at a sawmill, turning a log into cants, or planks of wood. History The original powered head saw was composed of long, narrow blades that used an up-and-down motion, a reciprocating saw. Each blade was set at a fixed width meaning each log was cut identically, regardless of flaws. This design was not energy efficient and around 1860 sawmills began to adopt the more efficient circular saw. In the 1870s, the limitation of log size due to the radius of the circular saw was improved with the introduction of the double circular saw- with one blade atop the other. In the 1880s, the band saw was introduced and was able to allow the head saw to handle logs of nearly unlimited size, ideal for the Californian redwoods. The Loggers, Williams, Richard L., Time Life Books, 1976, Modern use Today, head saws are mostly used for cutting logs 16 to 72 inches in diameter depending upon the type of band mill the saws are mounted on. More optimized machines now cut the smaller diameters since they are far more efficient and can provide greater production. Dependent upon the log diameter, head saws can cut a log at speeds ranging from 1 to 300 feet per minute. Generally, log carriage speeds are adjustable for optimal performance. Operation A head saw is operated by a head sawyer. The sawyer positions the log to the proper position for the initial cut while sizing up the log determining optimal usage. The offbearer is responsible for removing the cut boards.Head Rig, Ellis Lucia, c. 1965, Overland West Press See also * Lumber Edger * Resaw * Sawmill References Saws Sawmill technology de:Gattersäge ","title":"Head saw"},{"id":"9621685","text":"Double criminality, or dual criminality, is a requirement in the extradition law and international prisoner transfers of many countries. It states that a suspect can be extradited from one country to stand trial for breaking a second country's law only if a similar law exists in the extraditing country, and that any crime in any sentencing country must also be a crime in any other country to receive any internationally transferred prisoners. If Country A has no laws against blasphemy, for example, a lack of double criminality could prevent a suspect from being extradited from Country A to face blasphemy charges in another country, i.e. no outbound extradition from Country A, and neither are citizens of Country A eligible for international prisoner transfers from another country having criminally convicted them for blasphemy, i.e. no inbound prisoner transfer to Country A.  European Union  In accordance with Article 2(2) of the European Council Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA, the offences listed in that provision allow each EU member state to request a suspect (called a 'requested person') their 'surrender between judicial authorities' (the EU term that replaced extradition) pursuant to a European arrest warrant, without verification of the double criminality of the act. The only condition is that the offences they are suspected of ‘are punishable in the issuing Member State by a [sentence of] at least three years and as they are defined by the law of the issuing Member State’. The list, which includes 32 categories of offences, was subject of a court case before the European Court of Justice. The plaintiffs (a lawyers' organization) alleged that because it includes 'vague and imprecise' wording, such as \\"computer-related crime\\", \\"racism and xenophobia\\" or \\"counterfeiting and piracy of products\\" it breached or was at least capable of breaching the principle of legality in criminal matters. The court, however, dismissed the legality objections on the ground that the precise definition, of those offences and their penalty, was a matter for the national law of each of the (at the time 27) issuing Member States and therefore the legality principle was not a concern for the European Council. It ruled that the abolition of the double criminality requirement was justified on the grounds of: # the principle of mutual recognition, # in the light of the \\"high degree of trust and solidarity between the Member States\\", and # (inherently or simply because the 3+ years of punishment in the law) the categories of offences are of a seriousness which may affect public order and public safety and justifies dispensing with the verification of double criminality.  Hong Kong  See Fugitive Offenders and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation (Amendment) Bill 2019. A proposed Hong Kong extradition law tabled in April 2019, which would ease extradition to communist People's Republic of China, includes 37 types of crimes. While the Beijing-friendly ruling party maintains that the proposal contains protections of the dual criminality requirement, its opponents allege that after people are surrendered to the mainland, it can charge them with some other crime and impose the death penalty for that other crime. There are also concerns about the retroactive effect of the new law. The government's proposal was later amended to remove the categories after complaints from the business sector, such as \\"the unlawful use of computers\\". Experts have noted that the legal systems of mainland China and Hong Kong follow 'different protocols' with regard to the important conditions of double criminality and non-refoulement, as well as on the matter of executive vs. judicial oversight on any extradition request.

The game is created by Klaus Teuber, the creator of Settlers, and is published under license from Catan GmbH by Kosmos in German and Mayfair Games in English. It is the second game in the Catan Histories series of board games. Often games produced in different languages by different publishers have slight rule differences between the versions. Catan Histories: Struggle for Rome is no exception.  Gameplay  At the start of each game, each player is in control of a barbarian tribe situated outside of the Roman Empire. Each player's barbarian tribe consists of a tribe of warriors and a tribe of horsemen. To win, a player must gain ten victory points from sacking and ultimately conquering Roman cities. The gameboard consists of a hexagonal grid, with cities situated on certain intersections. Like in Settlers, each hex consists of a terrain type as well as a number token. Unlike Settlers, there are only four terrain types, of which three terrain types produce resources (of these, one produces one of two different resources). Certain edges between points are denoted with arrows - these have significance in the movement of barbarian tribes. In addition to the gameboard, a supply of coins is also given, providing a supplementary \\"gold\\" resource. At the start of each turn, a player first rolls the dice, and, if a 7 is not rolled, the players collect resources. Like Settlers, all players collect resources whenever their cities or nomadic tribes are adjacent to a hex with a number token matching the number rolled on the dice. However, unlike Settlers, in Struggle for Rome a player can only gain one resource from any hex, regardless of the number of cities or nomadic tribes that are in its surrounding intersections. If a 7 is rolled, the Roman Legionnaire, the Struggle for Rome version of the Settlers robber, is moved to any hex on the board, and a player may steal a resource (or three (two gold in English version) gold in lieu of a resource) from a player with a city or tribe adjacent. Unlike Settlers, there is no limit to the number of resource a player have in their possession (except when there are not enough resources to be distributed to all players). Resource collection is done four times (however, each of the four times must have a different number showing on the dice). After the resources are rolled, each player may, in turn, trade and build, starting with the player on move. Players may trade resources and gold for any agreed-upon price - however all trades must involve the player who is trading and building. Players may use their resources to buy development cards (which may be played any time after purchase, with each card granting different effects) or augment their two tribes by adding warriors, horsemen, or supply wagons. After trading and building is completed by all players, players may take action with their horseman tribe, and after each player has taken action, do the same with their warrior tribe. A player may choose to take no action, in which they receive 2 gold (or a resource in the English version). Each tribe, when nomadic, may choose to move their tribe to any unoccupied intersection on the board - however, moving over edges marked with arrows may cost resources and gold. When a tribe is adjacent to a city, they may attempt to sack the city or conquer it - in either case, the number of horsemen or warriors (whichever is relevant) must exceed the city's defense value (which may vary from 2 for outlying cities and 5 for Rome itself). If a city is sacked, the player may reveal the plunder token that is placed there at the start of the game for their reward (which may also incur losses in warriors or spearmen). If a city is conquered, the plunder token (if still extant) is discarded, and a supply wagon from the tribe and a warrior or horseman (whichever is applicable) is placed at the location of the conquered city, and the tribe in question ceases to be nomadic. A city may only be conquered if the tribe in question has sacked at least one city in three of the five provinces depicted. A tribe with a city may attempt to conquer (never pillage) a nearby city through similar means. Players earn one victory point for each city, as well as two points if both tribes have established four cities. A player also earns two points if either tribe has plundered a city in every province. Some development cards are worth one victory point, while others, called \\"Diplomats,\\" allow the players to act as though they had rolled a 7, and give two victory points for the first player to play three of them. The victory points are stolen if another player plays more. The game ends whenever any player has ten victory points, at which point the game is continued until the end of the turn. At this point, the player with the most victory points (the most gold if this is tied) wins. Terror of the Legions Terror of the Legions is a minor expansion for Struggle for Rome that can be downloaded from the Catan website: http://www.klausteuber.com/en/download/?SfR_Terror-of-the-Legions.pdf. It introduces a one victory point bonus awarded to players who have conquered three cities with four or five towers each, marked on the board with a special symbol. When this expansion is used, the game is played to 11 points instead of ten.

It is a mix of dryland canyon and steppe and adjoining rangeland flanking the canyon of Churn Creek and that stream's confluence with the Fraser River at the northern apex of the Camelsfoot Range. The historic Gang Ranch is just north of the Churn Creek Protected Area. The Empire Valley Ranch ecological preserve was added to the Protected Area in an expansion.  Geography  The protected area is located in the southwestern area of the province of British Columbia, in the Cariboo region, on the southern edge of the Chilcotin Plateau. It encompasses most of the drainage area of Churn Creek, and its eastern boundary is the Fraser River. The southern portion of the park includes a large expanse of the western bank of the Fraser, including the lower parts of the drainages of Grinder and Lone Cabin creeks. It also includes several small lakes. The terrain is deeply cut by rivers and creeks into canyons and benchlands, and the Camelsfoot Range rises to more than in the western extreme of the park. The Churn Creek canyon contains erosional features, such as pillars and hoodoos.  History  The Churn Creek area has been home to Tsilhqot'in and Secwepemc First Nations people for at least 7000 years. After the discovery of gold in the Cariboo region in the mid-1800s, Europeans moved into the area. They brought with them the smallpox virus to which the First Nations people had no resistance. The population of the Tcexwe'ptem band in the Empire Valley was drastically reduced by smallpox in the 1860s, with the survivors joining the Canoe and Dog Creek bands to the east. Ranching became an important industry in the region; two large ranches, the Empire Valley and the Gang were formed around Churn Creek in the latter part of the 19th century.  Conservation history  Parks Canada identified the Churn Creek area as a potential park due to its populations of bighorn sheep and other mammals, but opposition from local ranchers stopped the formation of a National Park. After the Province of British Columbia completed an assessment of environmental resources in the Cariboo region in the 1990s, the area was again looked at as a potential park. The province compromised with ranchers by designating certain areas within the park as grazing land for cattle. Churn Creek Protected Area was officially named in 1995, and expanded in 1997 with the addition of the former Empire Valley ranch to the park. It is one of five parks in the province to protect grasslands areas.  Ecology  Grassland benches above the Fraser River in the park  Flora  In the lower reaches of the grasslands, bluebunch wheatgrass dominates the grass species, with big sagebrush appearing in clumps. Lichens and mosses are very common, covering up to eighty percent of the ground surface under and around the vascular plants. At higher elevations, the Interior Douglas fir begins to cover much of the land area. Deciduous trees such as aspen and poplar are present in copses and near the rivers, creeks, and lakes.  Fauna  Several herds of bighorn sheep live in the park, with some spending the whole year in the park, and some migrating into nearby alpine areas in the summer. Mule deer are also present. The grassland environment is home to birds, bats, small rodents, and reptile species. Bird species include the Brewer's sparrow, Lewis's woodpecker, long-billed curlew, gyrfalcon, short-eared owl, and prairie falcon. Bats include the Western small-footed myotis, and reptiles include the rubber boa and the gopher snake. The forests contain flammulated owl, Townsend's big-eared bat, and sharp-tailed grouse.

He is remembered for his participation in the Second Vatican Council, expanding the Melkite Church in the United States, and articulating the unique role of the Eastern Catholic Churches in his 1970 pastoral letter The Courage To Be Ourselves.  Early life  Joseph Elias Tawil was born in Damascus, Syria, the son of Elias and Malakie (Salman) Tawil. One of nine children in the family, he was raised in an observant Melkite family; his maternal uncles included Paul Salman, the Archbishop of Petra and all Jordan, and Archimandrite Clement Salman. He studied for the priesthood under the White Fathers in St. Anne's Seminary in Jerusalem. He was ordained as priest on July 20, 1936 and assigned to the Patriarchal College (Al Madrassah Al Batryakiyah) in Cairo, Egypt. For seven years he was a teacher and later dean of the institution. In 1943 he became president/headmaster of the college. He was raised to the dignity of archimandrite by Patriarch Maximos IV Sayegh in 1952 and appointed Patriarchal Vicar of Alexandria in 1954 with continued residence in Cairo as head of the college. Tawil continued to lead the Patriarchal College in Cairo until his appointment as Patriarchal Vicar of Damascus on August 29, 1959.  Episcopate = Damascus and United States  Tawil was consecrated bishop in Damascus on January 1, 1960. While in this position he attended the Second Vatican Council where, as a representative of the Melkite Church, he worked with Patriarch Maximos IV to further understanding and cooperation between the Church of Rome and the Eastern Orthodox Church. In November 1967 Patriarch Maximos IV was succeeded after his death by Archbishop Tawil's friend and predecessor in the Cairo Patriarchal College, Archbishop George Selim Hakim, a native Egyptian who took the name Maximos V. Archbishop Hakim had been the first Archbishop of Nazareth and all Galilee and had been the guide for Pope Paul VI on his pilgrimage to the Holy Land at the beginning of his reign. On October 30, 1969, Archbishop Tawil was appointed Apostolic Exarch for the United States by Pope Paul VI, and was installed on March 15, 1970. He succeeded Bishop Justin Najmy, the first Melkite bishop in the United States. Bishop Najmy had died only two years after his installation, and thus the major task of welding an efficient diocese out of the existing parishes scattered over the country fell to Archbishop Tawil. Upon arriving in the United States Tawil was fluent in Arabic and French and proficient in Greek and Latin but did not speak English. He quickly learned English and published some of his most influential writings in the language of his new homeland.  The Courage To Be Ourselves  One of Tawil's first actions was to write the pastoral letter \\"The Courage to be Ourselves\\" to strengthen his flock, many of whom were relatively newcomers in this country and surrounded by the far more numerous Latin Catholics. The document, delivered as a Christmas 1970 pastoral letter, reminds Eastern Catholics of their rich traditions and how the Catholic Church benefits from diversity. In it he stated:  Development of the Eparchy of Newton  Tawil founded the diocesan publication \\"Sophia\\" and in 1971 established a diaconate training program, the first in an Eastern Catholic diocese in the United States. He also established a Diocesan Pastoral Council. Later he inaugurated a Diocesan Communications Office, the National Association of Melkite Youth, and a full-time Office of Educational Services. On June 28, 1976 Tawil was raised to archbishop. He was installed as eparch of Newton on February 14, 1977. During his tenure as eparch, Tawil founded eight new parishes and five missions. He ordained 26 new priests and 23 deacons. He also played a significant role in the founding a convent for women religious in Danbury, Connecticut. Upon reaching retirement age, Archbishop Tawil assumed emeritus status on December 12, 1989, but remained active in church affairs despite the onset of Parkinson's disease. He was succeeded by Bishop Ignatius Ghattas as Eparch of Newton. Tawil died at Newton-Wellesley Hospital in Massachusetts on February 17, 1999.

The Austro-Hungarian high command had assumed that the German success would weaken Russian forces in the north and that the Galician front would remain quiet. Both these assumptions were incorrect. Though the Habsburg 2nd army offensive opened on 16 November and met early success, the Russians proved stronger than expected and their 4th Army yielded little ground. Meanwhile, further south the Russian 2nd Army advanced across the San river and moved into the Tarnów area by 20 November. Further north, the Habsburg 4th Army, supported by the 47th German Reserve Division, moved onto the offensive in the last days of November. In fierce battles around the towns of Łapanów and Limanowa, the Russian 3rd Army was beaten and forced to retreat east, ending its opportunity to reach Kraków. To avoid being surrounded, the Russian 8th Army also had to retreat, stopping its advance toward the Hungarian plains. The confrontation was one of the final battles won unilaterally by the Austro-Hungarian Army. Most of its later victories during the war were dependent on German assistance, and it ceased to exist with the disestablishment of Austria-Hungary at the end of the war.

Beginning in 1981, Claridge's operated for many years as a casino, known first as \\"Del Webb's Claridge Hotel and Casino\\", then as \\"Claridge Hotel and Casino\\". The hotel was acquired by Bally's on December 30, 2002, as a hotel tower of Bally's Atlantic City. In February 2014, the property was acquired by TJM Properties of Clearwater, Florida, which returned the property to a stand-alone hotel without casino gambling. Location Located between Park Place and Indiana Avenue, with an attached parking structure extending to Ohio Avenue, the Claridge is set off the Boardwalk behind Brighton Park. The Claridge stands next to the site where the Sands Atlantic City used to be located. History The Claridge Hotel is different from most Atlantic City resorts, because it did not grow out of a modest boarding house. It was the idea of Philadelphia architect John McShain who designed the 24-story, 400-room hotel. Opened in 1930 during The Great Depression, the Claridge became the last of the great hotels built in Atlantic City near the Boardwalk; no new resorts rose in the city until the 1960s when a Howard Johnsons hotel was built along the boardwalk. Due to the Claridge's tall, slick, slender appearance it gained the nickname “The Skyscraper By The Sea\\". The Claridge was a successful hotel during the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. Marilyn Monroe was a special guest there in the 1950s when she was a judge of the annual Miss America Pageant. Despite Atlantic City's downturn as a premier vacation resort in the 1960s, the hotel continued to operate and survived into the casino era. Claridge Atlantic City Closeup of the Signage Casino era In February 1977, Claridge Associates, a group of Connecticut investors led by F. Francis D'Addario, purchased the Claridge Hotel. In 1979, they took on Del E. Webb Corporation as a partner in order to obtain financing. Del Webb owned several Nevada casinos, including The Mint Hotel and Casino in Downtown Las Vegas. The Claridge hotel was expanded with 200 new guest rooms being built; it had the distinction of being the last of the pre-casino Atlantic City hotels to be refurbished into a casino. The New Jersey Governor at the time, Brendan Byrne, had been dissatisfied with what he called “Patch and Paint” jobs of the city's old resorts, which had been done with Resorts Atlantic City and the Dennis Hotel, which is part of Bally's Atlantic City, and he lobbied hard for the old structures to be torn down and replaced with new resorts. Del Webb faced a difficult time obtaining a permanent license but finally obtained one in 1982. At that time, Del Webb bought out Claridge Associates' interest in the partnership. In July 1981, the new casino opened under the name Del Webb's Claridge Hotel and Casino (the hotel eventually became known as Del Webb's Claridge and eventually just The Claridge). The London-themed hotel saw success early on with its multi-level casino and 600-seat showroom that featured names like Aretha Franklin, Donny & Marie, Billy Crystal, Penn & Teller, Joan Rivers, The Isley Brothers, and The 5th Dimension. As larger casinos were built in the city, the Claridge had a hard time competing as a small casino in a large market. In the 1990s, a parking garage was added. In 2001, Park Place Entertainment purchasedhttp://www.allbusiness.com/company- activities-management/management/5934709-1.html the property and a year later formally announced plans to merge operations with Bally's Atlantic City. As a result, the Claridge became a hotel tower for Bally's. In 2009, all of the Claridge's own restaurants ceased operation, but a small cafe, \\"The Corner Cafe\\", that continues to operate in the Gateway area that connects the Claridge Tower with Bally's. In 2009, the Claridge rebranded its casino floor theRIDGE, and modeled the floor after a dance club, with a dance floor and DJ at its center, surrounded by table games. An extensive restoration was completed during the summer of 2010 through spring 2011, including a $3 million renovation of all hotel rooms and a $17 million facelift of the outside structure. But this was not enough to save its gambling business in the wake of a catastrophic period for Atlantic City's casinos, several of which filed for bankruptcy or closed altogether. theRIDGE ended its gambling and food operations during the winter of 2012; however, Bally's continued to use its 500 hotel rooms for guests. Current status On October 29, 2013, Caesars Entertainment announced that the Claridge tower was sold to TJM Properties of Clearwater, Florida. According to the statement, TJM will continue to operate the hotel and add non-gaming amenities to the property. On February 24, 2014, TJM Properties officially took ownership of the Claridge. The Claridge Hotel reopened in May 2014.http://www.claridge.com/press/announcing-summer-grand-opening-new- claridge-hotel/ The Claridge joined Radisson Hotels on October 17, 2016.

It involved in operating an Internet-based investment scheme which offers returns of up to 300% within 15 months of investment and has been identified as one of the Ponzi schemes taking place in 2000s. Despite the inclusion of the word Swiss in its name, the Swiss Mutual Fund's board of directors is composed solely of Dominican citizens, and the company does not appear to have any significant ties to Switzerland. History Swiss Mutual Fund originally claimed on its website that it was created after World War II in 1948 by the Cheviot family of France, with operations based in Bern, Switzerland. In 1996, the firm moved to the Commonwealth of Dominica due to changes in financial regulations in Europe. However the Swiss Embassy in Kuala Lumpur has stated the following: > \\"The Swiss Mutual Fund (1948) and or Swiss Cash are not registered companies > in Switzerland. Until proof of the contrary, the Embassy doubts that the > remarks about these funds and their historic links to Switzerland as > outlined on their original website are genuine. The original website is > indeed registered in the USA and the contact telephone number is from New > Jersey (USA).\\" This information was also corroborated by the Swiss Embassy in Singapore.Information about Misleading Publicity On 5 September 2006, Bank Negara Malaysia and the Securities Commission Malaysia said that the Swiss Mutual Fund was not licensed to accept deposits and carry out asset management activities or investment advisory services in Malaysia. Both institutions jointly issued a warning to the public against investing with Swiss Cash. On 13 December 2006, Swiss Mutual Fund (1948) S.A. was struck off the Commonwealth of Dominica's Register of International Business Companies.http://www.gov.im/lib/docs/fsc/PublicWarnings/dominicaswissmutualfund.pdf On 21 June 2007, the Securities Commission Malaysia obtained a worldwide Mareva injunction against the Swiss Cash operators to prevent them from disposing their assets in and outside of Malaysia. On 27 August 2007, the Swisscash website suddenly went offline denying members from logging into the website. According to Internet rumors, the website was down due to a hurricane. On 17 September 2007, the Financial Supervision Commission of the Commonwealth of Dominica issued a press release, which confirms that Swisscash is not a registered or incorporated company and does not have any established business in the island nation.http://www.gov.im/lib/docs/fsc/PublicWarnings/dominicanoticeswisscash2.pdf On 25 September 2008, the Securities Commission Malaysia obtained a High Court judgement against three defendants involved in the Swiss Cash investment scam. The court restrained them from carrying on the Swisscash business and ordered them to pay US$ 83 million and any further amounts to be traced for the purpose of compensating the investors of the scam. On 6 November 2009, the Securities Commission Malaysia entered into consent judgement with those involved to pay a sum of approximately RM 31 million to eligible investors who have suffered losses as a result of the Swiss Cash scam. On 21 December 2011, in its final status report to the Kuala Lumpur High Court, the Securities Commission Malaysia revealed that it had completed the distribution of the Swisscash settlement sum of RM 30.5 million to 19,625 eligible investors. Prior to the final settlement, a total of 29,885 claims amounting to RM 188 million were received from Malaysian and foreign investors of the Swiss Mutual Fund. The current version of the Swiss Mutual Fund website no longer includes any information about the company's history. Criticism There have been allegations that the Swiss Mutual Fund is a Pyramid scheme, with victims predominantly in Malaysia. The Central Bank of Malaysia has issued warnings regarding Swiss Mutual Fund's legitimacy, and have advised investors to avoid the company and its subsidiaries. The Monetary Authority of Singapore has placed Swiss Mutual Fund in their Investor Alert List. Hundreds of millions of US dollars have been lost to this scam by investors throughout the world and little or nothing has been done by governments to trace the trail of the money. It is feared that the money is actually used to fund global terrorist networks, and that terrorist networks have been using investment scams to obtain fund for their operations. Or some governments are behind this.

Early years, military service and professional career Cafesjian was born on April 26, 1925, in the Bensonhurst neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. His parents had come to the United States preceding the Armenian Genocide by the Turks. After amphibious training, he served as a sailor in World War II aboard J. P. Morgan's yacht, the Corsair III, built in 1895 and renamed the USS Oceanographer. The ship did extensive survey work in and around Guadalcanal and other Solomon Islands in 1943 and 1944. He also served aboard the USS Andres (DE45), a destroyer escort for convoys from the United States to North Africa in late 1944 and 1945. When he returned after the war he married Cleo Thomas, a nurse he met during the war. Cafesjian earned a degree in economics from Cornell University and a doctorate of jurisprudence from Columbia Law School, both in five and a half years. He was a member of the New York Bar Association. He began his career with West Publishing as a legal editor in New York City. He was the first employee in the history of the 100-year-old company to be transferred into the home offices in St. Paul, Minnesota. At West Publishing he rose through the ranks to the position of executive vice president, overseeing sales, marketing, customer service, public relations, and all Westlaw office training and development. At West, he conceived of and started the West Legal Directory and a well-known program, \\"Art and the Law\\", which earned him and West numerous awards. Philanthropic projects Cafesjian retired from West Publishing when it was sold to Thompson Publishing in 1996. As he said publicly, he felt his destiny was to help the country of Armenia, which had gained its independence after hundreds of years of subjugation under various rulers. The time and circumstances and confluence of resources would help him make a difference for the country. After attending to his family needs, he established the Cafesjian Family Foundation. Through the foundation, he devoted more than $128 million to various Armenian projects. His investments included the private Armenia TV and ArmNews television stations, the Cascade financial services group, real estate and a renewable energy company, all eventually sold. Any profits generated were re-invested in Armenia for further development. In the United States, Cafesjian helped restore a dismantled historic carousel for Como Park in St. Paul, Minnesota, and founded the Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art in Arizona. He also donated to the Armenia Fund USA, the Armenian Assembly of America, the Armenian General Benevolent Union, the Armenian National Committee of America, and others. He was also the owner of The Armenian Reporter, the oldest independent Armenian American publication. Cafesjian received accolades and recognition from both the U.S. and Armenia institutions, including the Ellis Island Medal of Honor in 2000 and COAF Save a Generation Award in 2010. Cafesjian Center for the Arts in Yerevan Cafesjian completely renovated the Cascade site in downtown Yerevan, Armenia. As of the early 2000s, it was an unfinished and crumbling Soviet structure of epic proportions on a hillside. Following a major reconstruction, the Cascade became the site of the Cafesjian Center for the Arts that opened in 2009. The museum enjoys a world- class sculpture garden with works by Fernando Botero, Lynn Chadwick, Barry Flanagan, François-Xavier Lalanne and Jaume Plensa, among others. Admission is free, and it is now the most prominent meeting place in Armenia. Over one million people have visited the Center since its opening. Armenian Genocide Museum and Memorial in Washington From 2000 to 2003, Cafesjian assembled a group of properties in Washington, D.C., two blocks from the White House, with the intention to build an Armenian Genocide Museum and Memorial. But due to continuing litigation, the project remains unrealized. Although Cafesjian won the basic lawsuit in January 2011 and was awarded the property,https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2008cv1254-193 and subsequent motions for new trial were dismissed, the project is still in limbo awaiting the Court to rule on yet another appeal. Personal life Gerard Cafesjian married Cleo Thomas, a nurse he met during World War II, on July 4, 1947, and together they had three children. Gerard's eldest son, Tommy Cafesjian, was a real estate magnate based out of Philadelphia. Gerard Cafesjian died on September 15, 2013, at the age of 88.

In 2015, 29,518 passengers have gone through the airport, and in 2016 this number fell to 26,624 people.  History  An old airport was located in 1 km (0.6 mi) from the train station of Zhezkazgan. It had two unpaved runways: 18/36 with the length of 1800 m (5905.5 ft) and 10/28 with the length of 1400 m (4593.1 ft). Often, airport couldn't operate flights due to its runways getting wet because of rain or melting snow in the spring, what has led to canceling flights. New, currently operating airport with an asphalt-concrete runway was built in 1971-1973, and in 1985, a new terminal was built, which could serve up to 200 passengers per hour. The first flight, operated by the new airport, was done by an Ilyushin Il-18 airplane.

Route description  Highway 105 begins at a junction with Highway 17 on the west side of Vermilion Bay, approximately east of Kenora and west of Dryden, travelling north. It progresses through a large region of uninhabited lakes, swamplands, forests and rocks for to Ear Falls, with Perrault Falls and Red Lake Road, Ontario, being the only communities between the two. Near Ear Falls, the route meets Highway 804 and Highway 657\\\\. Midway between Ear Falls and the northern terminus of the route is Pakwash Provincial Park and the community of Snake River. As Highway 105 approaches Red Lake, it meets Highway 125, which branches north to Balmerton and Cochenour. The highway ends north of Ear Falls in the town of Red Lake at Howey Street, which continues west as Highway 618.  History = Opening the frontier  The history of Highway 105 can be traced to the discovery of gold and the opening of mines in the area around Red Lake in 1926. Since the amount of gold in Red Lake was far greater than anyone expected, it was instantly realised that a road link was needed to fully utilize the gold mines, to export the minerals to the rest of the province. Until a road was constructed to Red Lake, the only way to reach the town was via boat, canoe, airplane, or seaplane, and this is how townspeople and miners came to and left from Red Lake and its mines. A road was not initially considered, due to how remote the town was from most other settlements, despite the very productive gold mines of the area. It would have been very expensive and extremely difficult to build a road through the remote, hilly, forest- and lake-filled area. Even after a road was finally decided upon, there were several large hurdles to overcome before the province could actually building it: Red Lake and the surrounding mines were in an extremely remote area of the province, and many questioned if a road to a subarctic town was required, especially given the financially straitened times of the Great Depression.  World War II  During World War II, the Government of Canada listed certain industries that were \\"protected\\" from exemptions, conscriptions of workers, and rationing. Among these were mining. In 1942, mining was removed from the list of \\"protected\\" wartime industries to ration goods, material and people for the war effort. When the miners were called up to the battlefields to become soldiers, the mines closed up and the need for a road diminished considerably. However, the mines resumed their activity upon World War II's end, producing gold in enormous quantities once more. The Department of Highways quickly constructed a gravel road from Vermilion Bay to Red Lake in the 1940s. It was designated as Highway 105, and the entire length of the road was paved by the early 1960s. Since opening, realignments and straightening of the road has shortened the road to . Even today, Highway 105 remains one of the most isolated roads in Ontario and one of the most isolated major highways in all of North America. It is advised that travellers fuel up and load supplies in Dryden, Kenora or Red Lake before travelling down this road, as rest stops are few and far between.

Wright Air National Guard Base, Utah. If activated to federal service, the Wing is gained by the United States Air Force Air Mobility Command. The primary mission of the 151st Air Refueling Wing is to provide air refueling support to major commands of the United States Air Force, as well as other U.S. military forces and the military forces of allied nations. Additionally, the unit can support airlift missions. The unit is also tasked with supporting the nuclear strike missions of the Single Integrated Operational Plan. Units * 151st Operations Group : 191st Air Refueling Squadron * 151st Maintenance Group * 151st Mission Support Group * 151st Medical Group * 151st Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance Group History On 1 July 1958, the Utah Air National Guard 191st Fighter- Interceptor Squadron was authorized to expand to a group level, and the 151st Fighter-Interceptor Group was established by the National Guard Bureau. The 191st FIS becoming the group's flying squadron. Other squadrons assigned into the group were the 151st Headquarters, 151st Material Squadron (Maintenance), 151st Combat Support Squadron, and the 1151st USAF Dispensary. The group was gained by the Air Defense Command (ADC) 29th Air Division. In 1958, the 151st FIW implemented the ADC Runway Alert Program, in which interceptors of the 191st Fighter-Interceptor Squadron were committed to a five-minute runway alert. Its existing F-86A day interceptors were replaced by the F-86L Sabre Interceptor, a day/night/all-weather aircraft designed to be integrated into the ADC SAGE interceptor direction and control system. Transport mission On 1 April 1961, the 151st was transferred from Air Defense Command to the Military Air Transport Service (MATS), and re-equipped with C-97 Stratofreighter. The 151st Air Transport Group expanded its military airlift role to worldwide mission capabilities. Entering the realm of Southeast Asia and the Vietnam War, the Utah Air National Guard flew its first mission into the Southeast Asia theater combat zone in late 1964, and continued to do so throughout the Vietnam War years. In January 1966, the unit became the 151st Military Airlift Group (151 MAG), under the Military Airlift Command [MAC]. In 1969, the C-97s were retired and replaced by the C-124C Globemaster II. During the Vietnam War, Utah Air Guard crews flew 6,600 hours of support missions for American forces. Air Refueling The 151st Military Airlift Group was transferred to Strategic Air Command (SAC) on 1 July 1972 and was equipped with second-line KC-97L Stratotankers. In 1978, the squadron received KC-135A Stratotankers; a newer and faster jet tanker. In January 1979 the unit began the 24-hour-per-day Strategic Air Command (SAC) alert commitment. This commitment would be maintained for the next 12 years until President George Bush ended the SAC Alert Force in 1991. The 1980s found the squadron involved in many training exercises as well as \\"real World\\" flying missions. In 1982 the unit converted to a newer version model aircraft—the KC-135E. In April 1983 the 191st Air Refueling Squadron was involved in the first Pacific Tanker Task Force, with flights to Guam, South Korea and Australia. Spring of 1984 brought a very large \\"first\\" for the 1191st Air Refueling Squadron. The unit participated in Coronet Giant, an exercise which entailed a direct flight from the United States to West Germany by 12, A-10 Thunderbolt II attack fighters, refueled along the way by three KC-135's from the 191st The route spanned 3600 miles, and was the largest mission of this type ever undertaken by a guard force. During Operation Desert Shield, the squadron received orders for a partial activation on 20 December 1990. All aircraft, aircrews and a number of support personnel were dispatched to the newest forward operating base at Cairo West Airport, Egypt on 27–29 December 1990. They became the basis for the 1706th Air Refueling Wing (Provisional). Other unit personnel were mobilized for use as stateside \\"backfill\\" (replacing troops sent forward) or sent to overseas destinations. On 30 April 1999, the 151st ARG was tasked for a Presidential Reserve Call Up due to the crisis in Kosovo. President William Clinton authorized the call up of 33,000 reserve personnel for up to 270 days. The 191st deployed to Europe to support Operation Allied Force. Global War on Terrorism Following the terrorist's attacks on the United States the squadron was tasked to provide aerial refueling support for the countless fighter combat air patrols performed over major U.S. cities. Dubbed Operation Noble Eagle (ONE), the 191st ARS flew their first ONE mission on 12 September 2001. The highest sortie production occurred in November when fighter combat air patrols occurred every four hours over most of the major U.S. cities. In addition to supporting ONE, the 191st ARS also provided support for Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), deploying aircraft and personnel to Spain to support combat air operations from late Sep 2001 until the spring of 2002. At home, local communities see many benefits from the Utah ANG. Many opportunities exist to meet legitimate military training needs while serving the community. Activities include Sub-for-Santa, Blood Drives, highway cleanup, and the 2002 Winter Olympics. The Utah ANG also maintains a state of readiness should Utah need support during an earthquake, flood, civil disturbance, or major disaster, and was involved in assisting evacuees in the aftermath of hurricanes Katrina and Rita.

He was a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 1998 to 2015, representing the electorates of Gosford (1988-2007) and Terrigal (2007-2015). He represented the Liberal Party for most of his career, serving as its deputy state leader from 2002 to 2003, and in the O'Farrell Ministry as Minister for Resources and Energy, Special Minister of State and Minister for the Central Coast. In 2013, he resigned to sit as an independent following his implication in an ongoing Independent Commission Against Corruption inquiry, and retired at the 2015 state election. Early life Hartcher was born in North Sydney and was educated at Saint Ignatius' College, Riverview. He received a Bachelor of Arts and a Bachelor of Laws from the University of Sydney. He then worked as a personal injury and family law solicitor employed by his uncle. Political career Hartcher was elected to represent Gosford for the Liberal Party at the 1988 NSW state election. He was appointed Government Whip in 1991 and served in that role until 1992. On 3 July 1992, Hartcher was appointed to the NSW Cabinet as Minister for the Environment and left the Cabinet with the defeat of the Fahey Government in March 1995. NSW Opposition After the 1995 election, Hartcher was appointed to a number of shadow ministerial portfolios, spending a combined eight years as Shadow Minister for Industrial Relations, five years as Shadow Attorney General, and three years as Shadow Minister for 2000 Olympic Games. On 28 March 2002 he was elected as deputy opposition leader under John Brogden until the 2003 state election. Former Premier Bob Carr was often Hartcher's political \\"sparring partner\\", a relationship Carr referred to as \\"good natured fun\\". Carr nicknamed Hartcher the Swamp Fox – an irreverent reference to US War of Independence guerrilla commander, Francis Marion – to suggest Hartcher would challenge Brogden for leadership of the party. At the 2003 election Hartcher was challenged in the seat of Gosford by Labor candidate Deborah O'Neill and won by only 272 votes. After narrowly retaining Gosford, Hartcher decided to step down as Deputy Liberal Leader. In 2006, New South Wales Legislative Assembly seats were subject to an electoral redistribution. The seat of Peats was abolished and the majority of the area was redistributed into a newly created seat of Gosford. The majority of the former seat of Gosford was redistributed into the new electoral district of Terrigal. Hartcher was again challenged by O'Neill but was elected Member for Terrigal on 24 March 2007. O'Neill was later elected as the Member for Robertson at the 2010 Federal Election. In 2010, Hartcher was endorsed as the Liberal Party's candidate for Terrigal ahead of the 2011 election. He was elected with a swing of 11.1 points, and won the seat with 74.1 per cent of the two-party vote. His main opponent was Labor's Trevor Drake, who was a former Liberal Party Gosford City Councillor. O'Farrell Government On 3 April 2011, Hartcher was appointed by Premier Barry O'Farrell to the Cabinet as Minister for Resources and Energy, Special Minister of State and Minister for the Central Coast. He resigned from Cabinet on 4 December 2013 after the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) raided his office. In February 2014, the ICAC commenced investigating allegations of electoral funding irregularities., link no longer available In response to the inquiry, Hartcher, and fellow MPs Chris Spence and Darren Webber, stood aside from the parliamentary party, even though they had just renominated for their seats, to sit as independents. With a final report not released before the 2015 election campaign, Hartcher, Spence and Webber chose to retire and not contest the next election. On 30 August 2016, the ICAC released its report into the investigation into illegal developer donations. It found that Hartcher had \\"Acted with the intention of evading laws banning political donations from property developers, cap donations and requiring the disclosure of donation\\" and also recommended that the Director of Public Prosecutions consider laying a charge against Hartcher of larceny. This recommendation related to a cheque for $4,000 made out to the Liberal Party as a donation, but found by ICAC to be deposited into an account controlled by Hartcher and later withdrawn in cash by Ray Carter. Personal life Hartcher is married with three sons.

Sanjdorj, History of the Mongolian People's Republic, Volume I, 1966 where they maintained close ties with the ruling dynasties of northern China. Because the various Hongirad clans never united under a single leader, the tribe never rose to great military glory. Their greatest fame comes from being the primary consort clan of the ruling house of Genghis Khan's Mongol empire. Genghis Khan's mother, great grandmother, and first wife were all Khongirads, as were many subsequent Mongol queens and princesses. During the Yuan dynasty they were given the title Lu Wang (\\"Prince of Lu\\"), and a few Khongirads may have migrated west into the territory of modern Uzbekistan and South Kazakhstan Province. Origin The Khongirads are often identified as the descendants of the ancient Wuku/Wugu tribe of Tang Dynasty records. The tribe's own origin myth claims that they were descended from three brothers born of a golden vessel—Jurluq Mergen, Quba Shira, and Tusbu Da'u. The descendants of these brothers formed the Hongirad tribe, but feuds quickly splintered the tribe and gave rise to the offshoot tribes of the Ikires, Olkhonud, Karanut, Gorlos, and Qongliyuts. Only the descendants of Jurluq Mergen retained the tribal name of Hongirad. One of the most famous Hongirad ancestors was Miser Ulug, an Onggirat Hercules who was super-humanly strong and often slept for days at a time. Many names of the 12th century's Hongirads and their subtribes have Mongol origin:The Secret History of the Mongols *Dei Setsen — tsetsen (wise) *Jurluq Mergen — zörlög (path) mergen (wise). (See Merkit) *Quba Shira — goo (beautiful) shar (yellow). In the 1680s Zasagt Khan of the Khalkha Mongolia was Shar (Shira). (See Alan Gua). Subtribes *Hongirad — khun (swan), khungiin (swan's), ard (person); swan person. Swan is one of Mongol totems. (See Oirats). *Qongliyuts — Khonkhluud; khonkh (bell), \\"iud\\" or \\"uud\\" is plural suffix. *Gorlos — Modern Southern Mongol subgroup *Ikires — Ikhires: ikh (great), ikhes (chief, noble) *Karanut — Kharnuud: khar (black), \\"iud\\" or \\"uud\\" is plural suffix *Olkhunut — Olkhunuud, \\"uud\\" is plural suffix. They have three subgroups: **Alag aduutan: alag (piebald), aduutan (horse herder); piebald horse herder. **Shar khonit: shar (yellow), khoni (sheep); yellow sheep breeder. **Ulaan zalaat: ulaan (red), zalaa (tassel); person who wears hat with red tassel. Today, Mongols call themselves \\"red-tasseled Mongols\\" because Mongols wear hat with red tassel and they adore fire. Fire is a general symbol of eternal growth, wealth, and success and a figure of fire is used in Mongolian flag, coat of arms and Soyombo symbol. The three tongues of the flame represent the past, present, and future. Shamanic practices continue in present-day Mongol culture.Shamanism in China: bibliography, by Barend ter Haar, who teaches at the Institute for Chinese Studies. Mentions that a book called Popular Religion and Shamanism includes \\"as well as three studies of shamanism among non-Han cultures (Mongol, Tungusic and Daba)\\".Local Belief Systems , by Professor Mark Bender. Ohio State University. Relationship with the Mongols: The Legend of Ergune Khun According to Mongol legend, two warriors named Kiyan (Khiyad) and Negus (Mongolian: Nokhos, dog or wolf) were defeated in battle and forced to seek shelter in an enclosed valley called Ergune khun (\\"steep cliffs\\"). After several generations the descendants of these heroes became too numerous for the valley to support, but no one remembered the way out. A blacksmith came up with a solution—they would create their own way out by melting an exposed iron vein that existed in one of the encircling mountains. Building a massive fire and stoking it with 70 large bellows, the trapped clan did just that and succeeded in creating a passage to the outside world. Once free, the people of Kiyan and Negus went on to create several tribes, including the Mongols and the Hongirads (whose susceptibility to gout was explained by the \\"fact\\" that their ancestors were the first to flee Ergene Qun, so they burned their feet on the hot iron). Consort Tribe Empress Radnashiri was from the Khunggirad In addition to having a shared ancestry with the Mongols in general, the Hongirads also shared ancestors with the Mongol royal line, whose originator, Alan Qo'a, was a woman of the Kharlas clan, an offshoot of the Khongirads founded by the legendary Miser Ulug. Down to the 12th century, Mongol rulers such as Khabul Khan and his great-grandson Genghis Khan were still taking Khongirad wives. Yesugei Ba'atur, the father of Genghis Khan, was not a high ranking Mongol leader, but even he secured himself an Onggirat wife by stealing one from another man. The wives of most rulers of the Yuan Dynasty and Golden Horde were also from the Hongirad. That is why, they held enormous powers behind the courts in both states. They forced the rulers of the Golden Horde to make peace with Kublai in 1280's and convinced Tokhta Khan to accept supremacy of the Great Khan in 1304. The Hongirad under queen Dagi and Temüder, the Minister of the Secretariat, reached their political peak in the Yuan Dynasty, the principal state of 4 khanates, during the reign of Gegeen Khan Shidebala (r.1321-1323). They built Yingchang city in modern Inner Mongolia in 1271. After the death of the last Yuan emperor, Toghan Temur, who lost his imperial status in China and other Mongol khanates, a body of the Khongirat and Olkhunut (Borte's clan) surrendered to the Ming Dynasty in 1371. Meanwhile, the Khongirad, belonged to the southern Khalkha tumen in modern Inner Mongolia and Olkhunuts lived in modern Khovd Province. Transoxiana In the 18th century the basins of the Amu Darya and Syr Darya passed under the control of three Uzbek khanates claiming legitimacy in their descent from Genghis Khan. These were, from west to east, the Khongirads based on Khiva in Khwārezm (1717–1920), the Manghud in Bukhara (1753–1920), and the Mings in Kokand (Qǔqon; c. 1710–1876). The Sufi Dynasty (1359–1388) which was founded by the Qongirat elites in Khwārezm ruled their own state under the Jochids and Timur. The Qongirat Inaks became de facto rulers of the Khanate of Khiva in 18th century and their descendants assumed the title of khan themselves in 1804. On 2 February 1920, Khiva's last khan, Sayid Abdullah, abdicated before its territory was finally incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1924. Descendants found among the people in Mongolia and the Yugurs in Gansu, China, and little bit in the Karakalpaks and the Uzbegs. Kazakhstan Now, a Kazakh tribe of the Middle Juz named Qongırat (also spelled as Kongyrat, Konrat, etc.) are considered descendants of Khongirads (Ongrat, Kungrat in Turkish) (Gumilev, n.d). Around the beginning of the 20th century CE, the Kazakh Qongırats lived mainly in what is now Turkistan Region (formerly South Kazakhstan Region), especially in the vicinity of the city of Turkistan.1999 Copyright Agency BRIF Central Asia, Author A.I.SOBAKIN This region borders Uzbekistan, and a majority of the local population has at times been recorded as Uzbek; the part of the region in which the Kazakh Qongırats were concentrated was located between the Sır River and the lower reaches of the Chu River where it disappears in the steppe.

The school itself is located in the Eric Hamber Secondary catchment area, however students are commonly split up for post secondary education as Van Horne's catchment covers parts of both the Eric Hamber and John Oliver Secondary catchments. History Van Horne was built in 1911, and was named after Sir William Cornelius Van Horne, the general manager of the Canadian Pacific Railway. On May 26, 2011, Van Horne celebrated its centennial. Architecture The main building (built in 1911) was built in a neoclassical style with brick common to many Vancouver Schools built at the turn of the 20th century. The addition of a gymnasium and classrooms were added in later years. In 2003 the VSB began seismic upgrades on the school, including the re- arrangement of classrooms, the addition of new library and computer lab facilities. On the west side of the main building, there are two detached classrooms. Distance Education In 2006, Van Horne was chosen as the host school for the GVDES (Greater Vancouver Distance Education School) Primary Program, but in 2009, the GVDES moved to the nearby high school, John Oliver Secondary School.

The members of this family (p16INK4a, p15INK4b, p18INK4c, p19INK4d) are inhibitors of CDK4 (hence their name INhibitors of CDK4), and of CDK6. The other family of CKIs, CIP/KIP proteins are capable of inhibiting all CDKs. Enforced expression of INK4 proteins can lead to G1 arrest by promoting redistribution of Cip/Kip proteins and blocking cyclin E-CDK2 activity. In cycling cells, there is a resassortment of Cip/Kip proteins between CDK4/5 and CDK2 as cells progress through G1. Their function, inhibiting CDK4/6, is to block progression of the cell cycle beyond the G1 restriction point. In addition, INK4 proteins play roles in cellular senescence, apoptosis and DNA repair. INK4 proteins are tumor suppressors and loss-of-function mutations lead to carcinogenesis. INK4 proteins are highly similar in terms of structure and function, with up to 85% amino acid similarity. They contain multiple ankyrin repeats.  Genes  The INK4a/ARF/INK4b Locus. The INK4a/ARF/INK4b locus encodes three genes (p15INK4b, ARF, and p16INK4a) in a 35-kilobase stretch of the human genome. P15INK4b has a different reading frame that is physically separated from p16INK4a and ARF. P16INK4a and ARF have different first exons that are spliced to the same second and third exon. While those second and third exons are shared by p16INK4a and ARF, the proteins are encoded in different reading frames meaning that p16INK4a and ARF are not isoforms, nor do they share any amino acid homology.  Evolution  Polymorphisms of the p15INK4b/p16INK4a homolog were found to segregate with melanoma susceptibility in the Xiphophorus indicating that INK4 proteins have been involved with tumor suppression for over 350 million years. Furthermore, the older INK4-based system has been further bolstered by the evolution of the recent addition of the ARF-based anti-cancer response.  Function  INK4 in cyclin/CDK pathway INK4 proteins are cell-cycle inhibitors. When they bind to CDK4 and CDK6, they induce an allosteric change that leads to the formation of CDK-INK4 complexes rather than CDK-cyclin complexes. This leads to an inhibition of retinoblastoma (Rb) phosphorylation downstream. Therefore, the expression of p15INK4b or p16INK4A keeps the Rb-family proteins hypophosphorylated. This allows the hypophosphorylated Rb to repress transcription of S-phase genes causing cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase.  Subsets = P16INK4a  P16 is formed from four ankyrin repeat (AR) motifs that exhibit a helix-turn-helix conformation except that the first helix in the second AR consists of four residues. P16 regulation involves epigenetic control and multiple transcription factors. PRC1, PRC2, YY1, and Id1 play a role in the suppression of p16INK4A expression and transcription factors CTCF, Sp1, and ETs activate p16INK4A transcription. In knockout experiments, it was found that mice lacking just p16INK4a were more prone to spontaneous cancers. Mice lacking both p16INK4a and ARF were found to be even more tumor prone than the mice lacking just p16INK4a.  P15INK4b  P15 is also formed from four ankyrin repeat (AR) motifs. Expression of P15INK4b is induced by TGF-b indicating its role as a potential downstream effector of TGF-b mediated growth arrest.  P18INK4c  P18INK4c has been shown to play an important role in modulating TCR-mediated T cell proliferation. The loss of p18INK4c in T cells reduced the requirement of CD28 costimulation for efficient T cell proliferation. Other INK4 family members did not affect this process. Furthermore, it was shown that p18INK4c is preferentially inhibitory to CDK6, but not CDK4 activity in activated T cells that suggest p18INK4c may set an inhibitory threshold in resting T cells.  Clinical significance= Role in cancer Cells containing oncogenic mutations in-vivo often responded by activating the INK4A/ARF/INK4B locus that encodes the INK4 tumor suppressor proteins. The unusual genomic arrangement of the INK4a/ARF/INK4b locus functions as a weakness in our anti-cancer defenses. This is due to the fact that three crucial regulators of the RB and p53 (regulated by ARF) are vulnerable to one single, small deletion. This observation yields two possible opposing conclusions: Either tumor formation does not provide any evolutionary selection pressure because the overlapping INK4a/ARF/INK4b is not selected against or tumorigenesis provides such a strong pressure, that an entire group of genes has been selected for at the INK4a/ARF/INK4b locus to prevent cancer. The response of the INK4a/ARF/INK4b locus efficiently prevents cancers that could occur to the constant oncogenic mutations that occur in long-lived mammals. When the INK4a/ARF/INK4b locus was overexpressed, the mice demonstrated a 3-fold reduction in the incidence of spontaneous cancers. This evidence further indicated that the INK4a/ARF/INK4b locus in mice plays a role in tumor suppression.  Role in aging The INK4 family has been implicated in the aging process. The expression of p16INK4a increases with aging in many tissues of rodents and humans. It was also shown that INK4a/ARF deficient animals increase an age-related decline in T-cell responsiveness to CD3 and CD28, which is a hallmark of aging. Furthermore, neural stem cells from Bmi-1- deficient animals demonstrate increased INK4a/ARF expression and impaired regenerative potential. The phenotype; however, can be rescued by p16INK4a deficiency implying that while p16INK4a can potentially be used as a biomarker of physiologic, rather than chronologic age, it is also an effector of aging. The mechanism by which it does this is by limiting the self-renewal capacity of disparate tissues such as lymphoid organs, bone marrow, and the brain.  Regulation of INK4 expression Initially, it was thought that each INK4 family member was structurally redundant and equally potent. It was later found; however, that INK4 family members are differentially expressed during mouse development. The diversity in expression pattern indicates that the INK4 gene family may have cell lineage-specific or tissue-specific functions. Evidence has shown that INK4a/ARF expression increase at an early stage of tumorigenesis, but the precise stimuli relevant to cancer that induces the expression of the locus is unknown. Expression of p15INK4b does not correlate with p16INK4a in many normal rodent tissues. Induction and repression of p15INK4b; however, has been noted in response to a few signaling events such as RAS activation, that also induce INK4/ARF expression. RAS activation might lead to increased INK4/ARF expression potentially through ERK-mediated activation of Ets1/2 to induce p16INK4. A few repressors of INK4a/ARF/INK4b expression have been identified as well. T box proteins and the polycomb group have been shown to repress p16INK4a, p15INK4b, and ARF.

It was performed on 3 February 1611 at Whitehall Palace, and published in 1616. Love Freed from Ignorance and Folly proved to be the last masque in which Anne of Denmark, King James I's Queen, performed.  Background  During the previous six years, the English Court of King James I had established a pattern of staging a major (and expensive) masque in the Christmas season, often on Twelfth Night. James's queen, Anne of Denmark, was a prime mover is these entertainments, and repeatedly performed in them herself, as in the masques of Blackness (1605), Beauty (1608), and Queens (1609). 1611 saw a divergence from this pattern: the major masque of that season was Oberon, the Faery Prince, which starred Anne's and James's eldest son Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales. Anne got a masque of her own a month later, though it was a more modest affair than previous events; while the bills for earlier masques regularly ran into the thousands of pounds, the total for Love Freed from Ignorance and Folly was only £719.Michael Leapman, Inigo: The Troubled Life of Inigo Jones, Architect of the English Renaissance, London, Headline Book Pyblishing, 2003; p. 83. (Anne's masque had originally been scheduled for December 1610, and then for Twelfth Night, 6 January 1611; it was postponed twice because of delays in the arrival of the French ambassador, in the wake of the assassination of Henri IV.)John Leeds Barroll, Anne of Denmark, Queen of England: A Cultural Biography, Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania Press, 2001; pp. 127-8. The show The masque featured a dozen primary masquers: Anne's ladies in waiting as Daughters of the Morn, with Anne herself as the Queen of the Orient. The anti-masque correspondingly featured twelve Follies or \\"she- fools.\\" The masque begins with a long conversation between Cupid and a Sphinx; the conceit is that the Sphinx has captured \\"Love,\\" who must in turn be liberated from this captivity -- hence the title. (Cupid's nakedness was simulated with a flesh-colored satin costume.) Cupid is freed by the priests of the Muses, who clue the god to the correct answers to the Sphinx's riddles (which are \\"Britain\\" and \\"King James\\"). The Queen and Daughters of the Morn also must be released from the Sphinx's imprisonment. Once they are released they appear in a cloud in the sky above their former prison. Fees Both Jonson and Jones received their standard fee of £40 for the masque, though a \\"dancing master\\" Nicholas Confesse who taught the ladies their choreography was paid £50, and his assistant Jacques Bochan got £20. Ferrabosco received £20, and musical assistants Robert Johnson and Thomas Lupo earned £5 for arranging the songs for lutes and violins. The five boys who played the Sphinx, Cupid, and the Graces got £2 apiece, but the twelve actors (male) who played the she-fools got only £1 each.E. K.

The first tropical depression and second tropical cyclone of the 1992 Atlantic hurricane season, the depression developed on June 25 from a tropical wave. Located in an environment of strong wind shear, much of the convection in the system was located well to the southeast of the poorly defined center of circulation. The depression moved northeastward and made landfall near Tampa, Florida on June 26 shortly before dissipating over land. The depression, in combination with an upper-level trough to its west, produced heavy rainfall to the east of its path, peaking at 33.43 inches (849 mm) in Cuba and 25 inches (635 mm) in Florida. In Cuba, the rainfall destroyed hundreds of homes and caused two fatalities. In Florida, particularly in Sarasota and Manatee counties, the rainfall caused severe flooding. 4,000 houses were affected, forcing thousands to evacuate. The flooding killed two in the state and was indirectly responsible for a traffic casualty. Damage in Florida totaled over $2.6 million (1992 USD, $4 million 2009 USD).  Meteorological history  A weak tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on June 12. It tracked westward across the tropical Atlantic Ocean with minimal convection, and subsequent to moving through the southern Windward Islands it crossed northern Central America. Convection increased on June 20 as the wave entered the southwestern Caribbean. Under the influence of southeasterly flow from developing Hurricane Celia in the eastern Pacific Ocean and the south-southwesterly flow from a mid- to upper-level trough over the Gulf of Mexico, the area of disturbed weather tracked generally north- northwestward through the Caribbean Sea while spreading across Cuba and southern Florida. On June 24, a mid-level circulation developed near the Yucatán Channel, and shortly thereafter satellite image loops indicated deep convection with some cyclonic rotation near the western tip of Cuba. A reconnaissance aircraft flight was dispatched late on June 24 into the system to determine if it developed into a tropical cyclone, though the flight did not observe evidence of a closed low-level circulation. Subsequent to the flight, satellite imagery indicated a low-level circulation was forming, and on June 25 ship and buoy data confirmed the system developed into Tropical Depression One while located about 235 miles (375 km) west-southwest of Key West, Florida. Operationally, the National Hurricane Center incorrectly classified the system as Tropical Depression Two due to an earlier subtropical storm. Upon becoming a tropical cyclone, the depression was poorly organized, with much of the convection located well to the southeast of the broad center due to strong upper-level wind shear. The shearing environment was caused by a trough in the Gulf of Mexico and from the outflow from Pacific Hurricane Celia. This was reflected in forecasts, with the National Hurricane Center predicting no significant change in intensity or structure. The depression moved northward before turning to the northeast, and on June 26 the poorly organized system made landfall just north of Tampa, Florida. The low-level circulation dissipated while crossing the Florida peninsula, with the remnants continuing northeastward before being absorbed by a large extratropical cyclone over the western Atlantic.  Impact  Rainfall summary for the tropical depression The tropical depression, in combination with the upper- level trough to its west, produced moderate precipitation across Cuba, peaking at . This is the fifth highest known rainfall total from a tropical cyclone in the country. The rainfall primarily affected the provinces of Pinar del Río, Matanzas, and Havana. Two Cuban citizens were killed by the rainfall, with an Arab student reported missing and presumed drowned. The deluge damaged or destroyed hundreds of houses in Pinar del Río and Havana provinces. In Florida, the depression produced moderate winds near the coast, peaking at in Naples. As in Cuba, the system dropped torrential rainfall, peaking at at Arcadia Tower. Large portions of the state reported totals in excess of from the depression, with much of Sarasota County receiving over of rain. The rainfall was classified as a 100-year flood in Sarasota and Manatee counties, where flooding reached deep in some locations. Officials in Manatee County declared a state of emergency in response to the flooding. There, about 3,000 people were forced to evacuate their homes due to the flooding, some of whom left by boat. The flooding damaged about 50 houses in and around Oneco. Due to the evacuations, no injuries were reported. The reservoir in Manatee County rose to over , above normal, which resulted in officials opening floodgates to prevent flooding. Tropical Depression One shortly before dissipating In Sarasota County, the flooding closed several roads and led to many overflown creeks and rivers, including the Horse Creek which crested at above flood level. Damage to roads and bridges totaled about $1 million. Due to the flat landscape of the region, the flooding persisted for several days. The depression spawned a tornado in a mobile home park in Nokomis, destroying the roofs of five homes and causing leaks in twelve others. Throughout the area, the passage of the depression left about 45,000 customers without power, primarily due to gusty winds. The outages were fairly short-lived due to power companies calling in extra workers to restore the power. Moderate winds toppled a construction crane at the northern end of the Sunshine Skyway Bridge, closing the bridge for 35 minutes before the crane was removed. In Pinellas County, a man hydroplaned while driving along a flooded roadway; he crashed into a concrete pole and was killed. Severe crop damage to orange trees was reported in association with the flooding. Damage from the depression totaled over $2.6 million (1992 USD, $4 million 2008 USD), with about 4,000 houses affected by the flooding and an additional 70 destroyed. Two people were killed in Florida. On August 14, about six weeks after the flooding, President George H. W. Bush declared a major disaster area for Charlotte, DeSoto, Manatee, and Sarasota counties. The declaration allowed for the use of federal funding to assist in the aftermath of the system.

For populations that are symmetric about one median, such as the (Gaussian) normal distribution or the Student t-distribution, the Hodges–Lehmann estimator is a consistent and median-unbiased estimate of the population median. For non-symmetric populations, the Hodges–Lehmann estimator estimates the \\"pseudo–median\\", which is closely related to the population median. The Hodges–Lehmann estimator was proposed originally for estimating the location parameter of one-dimensional populations, but it has been used for many more purposes. It has been used to estimate the differences between the members of two populations. It has been generalized from univariate populations to multivariate populations, which produce samples of vectors. It is based on the Wilcoxon signed-rank statistic. In statistical theory, it was an early example of a rank-based estimator, an important class of estimators both in nonparametric statistics and in robust statistics. The Hodges–Lehmann estimator was proposed in 1963 independently by Pranab Kumar Sen and by Joseph Hodges and Erich Lehmann, and so it is also called the \\"Hodges–Lehmann–Sen estimator\\". Definition In the simplest case, the \\"Hodges–Lehmann\\" statistic estimates the location parameter for a univariate population.Dodge, Y. (2003) The Oxford Dictionary of Statistical Terms, OUP. Entry for \\"Hodges-Lehmann one-samaple estimator\\"Hodges & Lehmann (1963) Its computation can be described quickly. For a dataset with n measurements, the set of all possible one- or two-element subsets of it has n(n + 1)/2 elements. For each such subset, the mean is computed; finally, the median of these n(n + 1)/2 averages is defined to be the Hodges–Lehmann estimator of location. The Hodges–Lehmann statistic also estimates the difference between two populations. For two sets of data with m and n observations, the set of two-element sets made of them is their Cartesian product, which contains m × n pairs of points (one from each set); each such pair defines one difference of values. The Hodges–Lehmann statistic is the median of the m × n differences.Everitt (2002) Entry for \\"Hodges-Lehmann estimator\\" Estimating the population median of a symmetric population For a population that is symmetric, the Hodges–Lehmann statistic estimates the population's median. It is a robust statistic that has a breakdown point of 0.29, which means that the statistic remains bounded even if nearly 30 percent of the data have been contaminated. This robustness is an important advantage over the sample mean, which has a zero breakdown point, being proportional to any single observation and so liable to being misled by even one outlier. The sample median is even more robust, having a breakdown point of 0.50.Myles Hollander. Douglas A. Wolfe. Nonparametric statistical methods. 2nd ed. John Wiley. The Hodges–Lehmann estimator is much better than the sample mean when estimating mixtures of normal distributions, also.Jureckova Sen. Robust Statistical Procedures. For symmetric distributions, the Hodges–Lehmann statistic has greater efficiency than does the sample median. For the normal distribution, the Hodges-Lehmann statistic is nearly as efficient as the sample mean. For the Cauchy distribution (Student t-distribution with one degree of freedom), the Hodges-Lehmann is infinitely more efficient than the sample mean, which is not a consistent estimator of the median. For non- symmetric populations, the Hodges-Lehmann statistic estimates the population's \\"pseudo-median\\", a location parameter that is closely related to the median. The difference between the median and pseudo-median is relatively small, and so this distinction is neglected in elementary discussions. Like the spatial median, the pseudo–median is well defined for all distributions of random variables having dimension two or greater; for one-dimensional distributions, there exists some pseudo–median, which need not be unique, however. Like the median, the pseudo–median is defined for even heavy–tailed distributions that lack any (finite) mean. The one-sample Hodges–Lehmann statistic need not estimate any population mean, which for many distributions does not exist. The two-sample Hodges–Lehmann estimator need not estimate the difference of two means or the difference of two (pseudo-)medians; rather, it estimates the differences between the population of the paired random–variables drawn respectively from the populations.

Biography Beale was born in San Francisco to Mary Engle Edwards and Edward Fitzgerald Beale; his siblings were Mary (1852–1925), who married Russian diplomat George Bakhmeteff, and Emily (1854–1912), who married John Roll McLean. He was named for his great-grandfather Commodore Thomas Truxtun. His maternal grandfather was U.S. Representative Samuel Edwards. In 1874 he graduated from the Pennsylvania Military College, and four years later, after studying law at Columbia University, was admitted to the bar. From 1876 to 1877 Beale was secretary to his father the US Ambassador to Austria-Hungary in Vienna. Instead of practicing law, he became manager of his father's Tejon Ranch in California, where he remained for 13 years. In 1891 he was appointed by President Harrison United States Minister to Persia, and a year later, Minister (afterward Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary) to Greece, Romania, and Serbia, making him ambassador to three countries at once. The years 1894-96 he devoted to travel in Siberia, Central Asia, and Chinese Turkestan. Many articles on international questions were contributed by him to reviews and magazines. On the death of his father in 1893, Beale inherited the Tejon Ranch. In 1894 he married his first wife, Harriet Blaine of Maine (the daughter of James G. Blaine), and together they had a son, Walker Blaine Beale (1896 - September 18, 1918), a Lieutenant in the United States Army who was killed in action in France in World War I. After divorcing Blaine, Beale returned to California and began a law practice. On the death of his mother in 1903 he inherited Decatur House in Washington, D.C. In the same year, on April 23, he married his second wife, Marie Oge of San Rafael, California in New York City. The marriage took place in New York City in order to avoid what a newspaper called \\"notoriety due to the shooting last year in San Francisco.\\" The couple initially divided their time between Washington and California but settled permanently at Decatur House following Beale's decision in 1912 to sell Tejon Ranch to a syndicate of investors headed by Harry Chandler and Moses Sherman. Truxtun Beale spent his last years assembling his father's papers for an official biography and writing about foreign affairs. He died at his country home near Annapolis, Maryland and is buried in Bruton Parish Churchyard, Williamsburg, Virginia.

On 30 March 2011, Maguire was appointed to Government Whip in the O'Farrell-Stoner Liberal/National coalition government; he had been Opposition Whip for the Coalition since 2003. On 13 July 2018, after admitting at a corruption inquiry that he sought payment over a property deal, Maguire resigned from the Liberal Party and resigned from Parliament on 3 August. Between 2015 and August 2020, Maguire had a close personal relationship with Gladys Berejiklian, who became Premier of New South Wales during that time. Early years and background Maguire has an extensive involvement with local community organisations. He was married to Maureen Maguire and has two children. Prior to his election to parliament, Maguire worked as a local store proprietor and franchisee. Maguire was previously an advisor to the China Council for the Promotion of Peaceful Reunification of China. Political career Maguire was elected to represent Wagga Wagga in 1999 following the retirement of long-standing member, Joe Schipp. Maguire held the seat comfortably whilst in opposition. In 2003, he was elected Opposition Whip and, after the 2011 state election, became Government Whip. At the 2011 state election, Maguire was challenged by Dr Joe McGirr, a local doctor and Director of the Emergency Department at Wagga Wagga Base Hospital. Maguire suffered a swing against the Liberal Party of 5.5 points, although won the seat comfortably with 52.5 per cent of the two-party vote. In July 2018, Maguire was drawn into an inquiry (Operation Dasha) by the NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) regarding possible corruption involving the former Canterbury Council, through his association with former councillor Michael Hawatt. It was alleged that Maguire had acted on behalf of a \\"mega big\\" Chinese client, asking for help in buying into development-approved projects, in return for a commission from the developer for both himself and Hawatt. As a consequence, Maguire resigned from the Liberal Party, and from his roles Parliamentary Secretary for the Centenary of ANZAC, Counter Terrorism, Corrections and Veterans. After initially refusing to resign from Parliament, he announced he would do so before its next sitting. Maguire tendered his resignation to the Speaker of the Legislative of Assembly on the afternoon of 3 August 2018. At the ensuing by-election held on 3 September, the Liberals lost almost half of their primary vote from 2015, allowing independent Joe McGirr to end the Liberals' 61-year hold on Wagga Wagga. The ICAC, during the course of Operation Dasha, intercepted a series of telephone calls that resulted in a separate inquiry (Operation Keppel) into the conduct of Maguire. Specifically, the ICAC sought to inquire whether, between 2012 and 2018, Maguire engaged in conduct that involved a breach of public trust by using his public office, involving his duties as a Member of Parliament, as a Parliamentary Secretary, and as Chair of the NSW Parliament Asia Pacific Friendship Group to improperly gain a benefit for himself and/or entities close to him. Appearing before the ICAC on 14 October 2020, Maguire admitted that he used his position as an Member of Parliament and as a Parliamentary Secretary to make money for himself and his associates. Appearing before the same ICAC inquiry, Gladys Berejiklian, the Premier of New South Wales, agreed that she had been in a \\"close personal relationship\\" with Maguire from 2015 until August 2020. Operation Keppel is ongoing.

He made the first nautical chart of the Delaware River and Delaware Bay, and established the first merchant packet line between London and Philadelphia. Early years Fisher was born in Sussex County, Delaware, into a Quaker family with historic roots, growing up in Lewes, Delaware. His father, Thomas Fisher (1669–1713), and mother, Margery Maud (1671–1770), were both Quakers, as were his grandparents. Margery Maud was a stepdaughter of Dr. Thomas Wynne. His grandfather, John Fisher, came to America aboard the \\"Welcome\\" with William Penn. Fisher was enterprising, and taught himself mathematics and mechanics. He married (July 27, 1733) a neighbor's daughter, Sarah Rowland, the granddaughter of Mary Harworth, an eloquent Friends minister who had also arrived on the \\"Welcome\\". Establishing a business Fisher settled in Lewes, Delaware, near Cape Henlopen, regularly attending Quaker Meeting. He learned to make hats from animal skins, started a hat-making business, and established an active trade with the local Indians in pelts of beaver and other small animals. He developed a transatlantic trade and sold many pelts to customers in England. In Lewes he opened a large inn and country store, which was frequented by many pilots and ship captains because Lewes was the first port at the mouth of Delaware Bay and a good location to learn about the channel to Philadelphia. Fisher gave the pilots advice about how to navigate Delaware Bay, which was notorious for its many shoals. He was appointed by Thomas Penn to be Deputy Surveyor General of Delaware. Family farm Fisher's father Thomas owned a property that included a farm, and another property at Cool Spring, west of Lewes, that included a farm house constructed in the Dutch style with a gambrel roof. When his father died in 1713, Fisher inherited the properties, ran them profitably for two decades, and in 1736 sold the Cool Spring property to Rev. James Martin, a pastor of nearby Presbyterian churches, whose descendants held the property for two centuries. In 1980, the Fisher-Martin house was moved to downtown Lewes, where it currently houses the Chamber of Commerce information center. Move to Philadelphia In 1746, Fisher sold his store and house in Lewes and moved with his wife and six children to Philadelphia, at first settling in a house on the north side of Walnut St above Front St. Later he built a house at 110 S. Front St. and moved his family there. He had owned slaves on the family farm outside of Lewes and sold them before the move, but later repurchased them and gave them and their descendants their freedom. Fisher also purchased a country estate north of the city overlooking the Schuylkill River from the east, and built a house there in 1753 called \\"The Cliffs\\", after his family's ancestral home in Yorkshire, England. The family often stayed at The Cliffs in the summer, enjoying the nearby river. Mercantile business Fisher built a warehouse in downtown Philadelphia at the back of the lot at 110 S. Front St where his house stood, and established there a prosperous mercantile business, \\"Joshua Fisher & Sons\\" (1762–1783), selling virtually every type of object. Soon after, Fisher established the first packet line of ships to sail regularly between Philadelphia and London, two of the largest cities in the British Empire. Customers were able to order items such as porcelain, silverware, brass pulls for dressers, and every other imaginable type of merchandise from a detailed catalog, and receive their goods within weeks. The business did not advertise much in the local newspapers because it was mainly a wholesale supplier to retail stores. Fisher's descendants still possess well-built Windsor chairs from the packet line. Map of Delaware Bay 1776 Map of Delaware Bay by Joshua Fisher Fisher continued his interest in the navigation of the Delaware Bay, and at night studied navigation. He was encouraged in this endeavor by the pilots and ship captains who continued to need accurate information about the shoals and channels of the bay. Over the course of 20 years Fisher developed a detailed map of the Delaware Bay with help from his brother-in- law, Samuel Rowland, and teacher Thomas Godfrey. The chart was very accurate for the day, showing observations of the exact latitude and longitude, and soundings, information about harbors, stream inlets, shoals, and ship channels. The chart was engraved by James Turner, funded by a group of local merchants and ship owners, and printed in 1756 in Philadelphia by printer John Davis. Fisher was ordered not to publish the map by the Governor, Robert Hunter Morris, because a war appeared likely with France and he was concerned that the map might fall into enemy hands. Fisher sent out copies of the map anyway and explained that the map did not show the full way to Philadelphia, and the complexity of the navigation to Philadelphia would deter the enemy. The map was re-engraved in Philadelphia in 1775, duplicated and published in London in 1776, and widely sold and distributed. It remained the standard map for navigation to Philadelphia for almost a century. Revolutionary War and family During the Revolution, much of Fisher's inventory of merchandise was commandeered by the military to support the revolutionary cause, but Fisher was not fully reimbursed for it. In 1779 his son Thomas and a slave worker were taken hostage from Fisher's farm in lower Delaware by the British, and Fisher was obliged to pay a ransom of 100 bullocks. As many Quakers did during the Revolution, he maintained a neutral position with respect to the fledgling country's conflicts, and he and his family suffered as a consequence. In 1777 Fisher's sons were ordered by the authorities to produce their firm's business records but they refused, and since they were Quakers they refused to swear an oath of allegiance. As a consequence sons Thomas, Samuel, Meirs were exiled to Winchester, Virginia along with several other Quakers, and kept under house arrest for a year. Although they were treated somewhat harshly they survived without severe illness, but their brother-in-law Thomas Gilpin and John Hunt died.Gummere, Amelia Mott (1922), The journal and essays of John Woolman, New York: The Macmillan Company, p.511 After evacuation of the British, the group of Quakers were eventually pardoned and allowed to return to Philadelphia by order of George Washington and the Congress. Fisher's son Samuel continued to show opposition to the revolutionary cause, and in 1779 he and was arrested on the charge of being a Tory on the basis of a letter he sent to his brother Jabez Maud on a ship unable to land in New York Harbor. Samuel exacerbated the situation by not recognizing the authority of the court and was sent to jail for 2 years. Fisher was by then too ill to be taken from his home and the charges against him were dropped. Fisher's sons continued the mercantile business and son Samuel continued the packet line to London, capturing business with catalogs of textiles and manufactured items, and the family continued to be prosperous. Fisher's great-grandson was Joseph Wharton, a prominent industrialist who founded the Wharton School of Business.

Biography Myriam grew up in a home with many brothers and sisters. Since she was a child, she dreamed of becoming a singer. Her musical career began in Monterrey with musical groups such as Obsesión, Conspiración, Ébano, Liberación and Compass. In 2002, she was selected for the Mexican musical reality TV show La Academia. During this show she sang \\"Como la Flor\\", \\"Mudanzas\\", \\"De mi enamorate\\", \\"Él me mintió\\" and other songs. Her charm and personality, as well as her great interpretative talent, propelled her to become one of the most popular persons in the reality show. After 5 months on the show, she was announced the winner at the Season Finale in the Auditorio Nacional in Mexico City. Myriam signed to EMI Music for 5 years or 5 albums. A week after winning La Academia, EMI released her first album, a compilation of the themes that Myriam sang in the show. It sold 30 copies within two months, not topping the Mexican charts and not being the first ex-student from La Academia to sell 35 albums worldwide; Her second album, Una Mujer, was led by the single \\"Sin Ti No Hay Nada\\". This album also included a song written by Soraya titled \\"Como Seria\\" which Myriam later released as a single. The album sold 20 copies. At this time, TV Azteca launched their first Desafio de Estrellas. Myriam ended up winning third place, coming behind Yahir (1st place) and Nadia (2nd place). After the show was over, a special edition of her album was released with studio versions of several of the songs she performed on Desafio de Estrellas, along with two unreleased songs, including \\"Amor Secreto\\", which was later recorded by Paulina Rubio for her album Pau Latina; this album did poorly. \\"Hasta El Limite\\" was the first single from this album, and was Myriam's most successful single. This album included songs written by Leonel from the duo Sin Bandera, from the Italian Tiziano Ferro, and also has a song composed by Estrella and Myriam, \\"Porque Soy Mujer\\", which was the second single. Months later the album reached 43 albums worldwide. A year later EMI released a fourth album, a mix of pop, ballads and Tex-Mex. The first single was \\"Vete de Aqui\\", which also was the name of the album. \\"Traicionera\\", \\"Fuego y Pasion\\" [Fogo & Paxiao], \\"Negra Pena\\" and \\"Lo Que Siento Es Amor\\" were also singles. The album sold 15 copies mostly to her family. Myriam returned in 2007 with a tribute album to Ana Gabriel, Simplemente Amigos (also the name of the first single), which did not enter the top 10 in the Mexican charts. The album only reached 87 albums sold . The second single was \\"Mar & Arena\\". EMI released a greatest hits album in August 2007 entitled The Best Of... Myriam, which includes all her singles plus a bonus disc that has the best songs that Myriam sang during La Academia. All the songs were digitally remastered. Myriam has received an award from EMI, \\"The Multiplatinum Range\\", for the high sales of her albums. This award was also awarded to RBD and Robbie Williams. On June 2, 2008 Myriam release a new album, Cambio de Piel, which she said was her best album so far. It is a pop album with notable composers such as Mario Domm and Reyli Barba. Stores in Mexico City, Veracruz, Monterrey and Guadalajara ran out of CDs on the first day of sale only because 210 albums were distributed in the country. On September 7, 2008 Myriam first presented her show with Kika Edgar in the \\"Teatro Metropolitan\\". In 2008, the composer Armando Manzanero choose her to be part of his new album, Las Mujeres de Manzanero, where Myriam sang \\"Regresa a Mi\\" and, in 2009, went on tour with the Mexican composer and his cast of notable female artists. In 2009, Myriam also participated in El Gran Desafio De Estrellas, a reality show competition produced by TV Azteca, where she won 2nd place in the final. During the last episode of this program Myriam made clear her desire to leave TV Azteca. Throughout 2010, Myriam performed in private concerts around the Mexican Republic, and made appearances on Multimedios Television, with events such as \\"El Corazon Mas Grande\\" and \\"Unidos Somos Nuevo León\\" (the latter of these an effort relief after a devastating weather event in Nuevo León, Mexico). In early 2011, Myriam released her 7th full-length album titled Regio Corazon, Alma Mexicana, which placed in Mexico's Top 100 list in Mexico for its first few weeks in the market. Promotion of the album was focused mainly in Monterrey and Mexico City, although Myriam presented herself in television programs, concert events, and radio stations throughout all of Mexico, as well as giving interviews to local (and non local) news. In late April and May, 2011, Myriam joined the musical production Jesucristo Superestrella (Jesus Christ Superstar), starring Mexican actor Mauricio Martinez as Jesus, where she played the role of Mary Magdalene while pregnant. Although the season did not last long, the musical was considered to be a hit. Currently Myriam is currently promoting her new album Regio Corazon, Alma Mexicana (released in February 2011) which contains grupero, banda, mariachi and norteno music. She also recorded a duet with Jorge \\"Coque\\" Muniz for his CD Emociones which is called \\"La Pareja Ideal\\", which Marco Antonio Solís and Marisela made famous some years ago. Myriam announced on March 14, 2011 through a press release and through her Twitter that she was pregnant. She also mentioned that she would still continue promoting her album Regio Corazon, Alma Mexicana. A couple of months later, in July 2011, Myriam announced that she had given birth to her firstborn son, Frank Alejandro. Myriam has made known through Twitter that she will soon be back in the music world with a new album, which she made known will be tentatively called Irracional.

The Moon's orbit is around 9 times larger (in radius and length) than geostationary orbit.Approximately 8.6 times when the moon is nearest (363 104 km ÷ 42 164 km) to 9.6 times when the moon is farthest (405 696 km ÷ 42 164 km). Various Earth orbits to scale; innermost, the red dotted line represents the orbit of the International Space Station (ISS); cyan represents low Earth orbit, yellow represents medium Earth orbit, and the black dashed line represents geosynchronous orbit. The green dashed line represents the orbit of Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites. The following is a list of types of orbits: Centric classifications * Galactocentric orbit : An orbit about the center of a galaxy. The Sun follows this type of orbit about the galactic center of the Milky Way. * Heliocentric orbit: An orbit around the Sun. In the Solar System, all planets, comets, and asteroids are in such orbits, as are many artificial satellites and pieces of space debris. Moons by contrast are not in a heliocentric orbit but rather orbit their parent object. * Geocentric orbit: An orbit around the planet Earth, such as that of the Moon or of artificial satellites. * Lunar orbit (also selenocentric orbit): An orbit around Earth's Moon. * Areocentric orbit: An orbit around the planet Mars, such as that of its moons or artificial satellites. For orbits centered about planets other than Earth and Mars, the orbit names incorporating Greek terminology is less commonly used * Mercury orbit (Hermocentric or hermiocentric): An orbit around the planet Mercury. * Venus orbit (Aphrodiocentric or cytheriocentric): An orbit around the planet Venus. * Jupiter orbit (Jovicentric or zenocentric): An orbit around the planet Jupiter. * Saturn orbit (Kronocentric or saturnocentric): An orbit around the planet Saturn. * Uranus orbit (Oranocentric): An orbit around the planet Uranus. * Neptune orbit (Poseidocentric): An orbit around the planet Neptune. Altitude classifications for geocentric orbits * Low Earth orbit (LEO): geocentric orbits with altitudes below ., pages 37–38 (6–1,6–2); figure 6-1. * Medium Earth orbit (MEO): geocentric orbits ranging in altitude from to just below geosynchronous orbit at . Also known as an intermediate circular orbit. These are \\"most commonly at , or , with an orbital period of 12 hours.\\" * Geosynchronous orbit (GSO) and geostationary orbit (GEO) are orbits around Earth matching Earth's sidereal rotation period. Although terms are often used interchangeably, technically a geosynchronous orbit matches the Earth's rotational period, but the definition does not require it to have zero orbital inclination to the equator, and thus is not stationary above a given point on the equator, but may oscillate north and south during the course of a day. Thus, a geostationary orbit is defined as a geosynchronous orbit at zero inclination. Geosynchronous (and geostationary) orbits have a semi-major axis of . This works out to an altitude of . Both complete one full orbit of Earth per sidereal day (relative to the stars, not the Sun). * High Earth orbit: geocentric orbits above the altitude of geosynchronous orbit (). Inclination classifications * Inclined orbit: An orbit whose inclination in reference to the equatorial plane is not 0. **Polar orbit: An orbit that passes above or nearly above both poles of the planet on each revolution. Therefore, it has an inclination of (or very close to) either 90 degrees or −90 degrees. ** Polar Sun-synchronous orbit (SSO): A nearly polar orbit that passes the equator at the same local solar time on every pass. Useful for image-taking satellites because shadows will be the same on every pass. * Non-inclined orbit: An orbit whose inclination is equal to zero with respect to some plane of reference. ** Ecliptic orbit: A non-inclined orbit with respect to the ecliptic. ** Equatorial orbit: A non-inclined orbit with respect to the equator. * Near equatorial orbit: An orbit whose inclination with respect to the equatorial plane is nearly zero. This orbit allows for rapid revisit times (for a single orbiting spacecraft) of near equatorial ground sites. Directional classifications * Prograde orbit: An orbit that is in the same direction as the rotation of the primary (i.e. east on Earth). By convention, the inclination of a Prograde orbit is specified as an angle less than 90°. * Retrograde orbit: An orbit counter to the direction of rotation of the primary. By convention, retrograde orbits are specified with an inclination angle of more than 90°. Apart from those in Sun-synchronous orbit, few satellites are launched into retrograde orbit on Earth because the quantity of fuel required to launch them is greater than for a prograde orbit. This is because when the rocket starts out on the ground, it already has an eastward component of velocity equal to the rotational velocity of the planet at its launch latitude. Eccentricity classifications There are two types of orbits: closed (periodic) orbits, and open (escape) orbits. Circular and elliptical orbits are closed. Parabolic and hyperbolic orbits are open. Radial orbits can be either open or closed. * Circular orbit: An orbit that has an eccentricity of 0 and whose path traces a circle. * Elliptic orbit: An orbit with an eccentricity greater than 0 and less than 1 whose orbit traces the path of an ellipse. ** Geostationary or geosynchronous transfer orbit (GTO): An elliptic orbit where the perigee is at the altitude of a low Earth orbit (LEO) and the apogee at the altitude of a geostationary orbit. ** Hohmann transfer orbit: An orbital maneuver that moves a spacecraft from one circular orbit to another using two engine impulses. This maneuver was named after Walter Hohmann. ** Ballistic capture orbit: a lower-energy orbit than a Hohmann transfer orbit, a spacecraft moving at a lower orbital velocity than the target celestial body is inserted into a similar orbit, allowing the planet or moon to move toward it and gravitationally snag it into orbit around the celestial body. ** Coelliptic orbit: A relative reference for two spacecraft—or more generally, satellites—in orbit in the same plane. \\"Coelliptic orbits can be defined as two orbits that are coplanar and confocal. A property of coelliptic orbits is that the difference in magnitude between aligned radius vectors is nearly the same, regardless of where within the orbits they are positioned. For this and other reasons, coelliptic orbits are useful in [spacecraft] rendezvous\\". * Parabolic orbit: An orbit with the eccentricity equal to 1. Such an orbit also has a velocity equal to the escape velocity and therefore will escape the gravitational pull of the planet. If the speed of a parabolic orbit is increased it will become a hyperbolic orbit. ** Escape orbit: A parabolic orbit where the object has escape velocity and is moving directly away from the planet. ** Capture orbit: A parabolic orbit where the object has escape velocity and is moving directly toward the planet. * Hyperbolic orbit: An orbit with the eccentricity greater than 1. Such an orbit also has a velocity in excess of the escape velocity and as such, will escape the gravitational pull of the planet and continue to travel infinitely until it is acted upon by another body with sufficient gravitational force. * Radial orbit: An orbit with zero angular momentum and eccentricity equal to 1. The two objects move directly towards or away from each other in a straight- line. ** Radial elliptic orbit: A closed elliptic orbit where the object is moving at less than the escape velocity. This is an elliptic orbit with semi- minor axis = 0 and eccentricity = 1. Although the eccentricity is 1, this is not a parabolic orbit. ** Radial parabolic orbit: An open parabolic orbit where the object is moving at the escape velocity. ** Radial hyperbolic orbit: An open hyperbolic orbit where the object is moving at greater than the escape velocity. This is a hyperbolic orbit with semi-minor axis = 0 and eccentricity = 1. Although the eccentricity is 1, this is not a parabolic orbit. Synchronicity classifications Geostationary orbit as seen from the north celestial pole. To an observer on the rotating Earth, the red and yellow satellites appear stationary in the sky above Singapore and Africa respectively. * Synchronous orbit: An orbit whose period is a rational multiple of the average rotational period of the body being orbited and in the same direction of rotation as that body. This means the track of the satellite, as seen from the central body, will repeat exactly after a fixed number of orbits. In practice, only 1:1 ratio (geosynchronous) and 1:2 ratios (semi-synchronous) are common. ** Geosynchronous orbit (GSO): An orbit around the Earth with a period equal to one sidereal day, which is Earth's average rotational period of 23 hours, 56 minutes, 4.091 seconds. For a nearly circular orbit, this implies an altitude of approximately . The orbit's inclination and eccentricity may not necessarily be zero. If both the inclination and eccentricity are zero, then the satellite will appear stationary from the ground. If not, then each day the satellite traces out an analemma (i.e. a \\"figure-eight\\") in the sky, as seen from the ground. When the orbit is circular and the rotational period has zero inclination, the orbit is considered to also be geostationary. Also known as a Clarke orbit after the writer Arthur C. Clarke. *** Geostationary orbit (GEO): A circular geosynchronous orbit with an inclination of zero. To an observer on the ground this satellite appears as a fixed point in the sky. \\"All geostationary orbits must be geosynchronous, but not all geosynchronous orbits are geostationary.\\" *** Tundra orbit: A synchronous but highly elliptic orbit with significant inclination (typically close to 63.4°) and orbital period of one sidereal day (23 hours, 56 minutes for the Earth). Such a satellite spends most of its time over a designated area of the planet. The particular inclination keeps the perigee shift small.This answer explains why such inclination keeps apsidial drift small: https://space.stackexchange.com/a/24256/6834 ** Areosynchronous orbit (ASO): A synchronous orbit around the planet Mars with an orbital period equal in length to Mars' sidereal day, 24.6229 hours. *** Areostationary orbit (AEO): A circular areosynchronous orbit on the equatorial plane and about 17,000 km (10,557 miles) above the surface of Mars. To an observer on Mars this satellite would appear as a fixed point in the sky. * Subsynchronous orbit: A drift orbit close below GSO/GEO. ** Semi-synchronous orbit: An orbit with an orbital period equal to half of the average rotational period of the body being orbited and in the same direction of rotation as that body. For Earth this means a period of just under 12 hours at an altitude of approximately 20,200 km (12,544.2 miles) if the orbit is circular. *** Molniya orbit: A semi-synchronous variation of a Tundra orbit. For Earth this means an orbital period of just under 12 hours. Such a satellite spends most of its time over two designated areas of the planet. An inclination of 63.4° is normally used to keep the perigee shift small. * Supersynchronous orbit: Any orbit in which the orbital period of a satellite or celestial body is greater than the rotational period of the body which contains the barycenter of the orbit. Orbits in galaxies or galaxy models * Box orbit: An orbit in a triaxial elliptical galaxy that fills in a roughly box-shaped region. * Pyramid orbit: An orbit near a massive black hole at the center of a triaxial galaxy.Merritt and Vasilev, ORBITS AROUND BLACK HOLES IN TRIAXIAL NUCLEI\\", The Astrophysical Journal 726(2), 61 (2011). The orbit can be described as a Keplerian ellipse that precesses about the black hole in two orthogonal directions, due to torques from the triaxial galaxy. The eccentricity of the ellipse reaches unity at the four corners of the pyramid, allowing the star on the orbit to come very close to the black hole. * Tube orbit: An orbit near a massive black hole at the center of an axisymmetric galaxy. Similar to a pyramid orbit, except that one component of the orbital angular momentum is conserved; as a result, the eccentricity never reaches unity. Special classifications * Sun-synchronous orbit: An orbit which combines altitude and inclination in such a way that the satellite passes over any given point of the planets's surface at the same local solar time. Such an orbit can place a satellite in constant sunlight and is useful for imaging, spy, and weather satellites. * Frozen orbit: An orbit in which natural drifting due to the central body's shape has been minimized by careful selection of the orbital parameters. * Orbit of the Moon: The orbital characteristics of the Moon. Average altitude of 384,403 kilometres (238,857 mi), elliptical-inclined orbit. * Beyond-low Earth orbit (BLEO) and beyond Earth orbit (BEO) are a broad class of orbits that are energetically farther out than low Earth orbit or require an insertion into a heliocentric orbit as part of a journey that may require multiple orbital insertions, respectively. * Near-rectilinear halo orbit (NRHO): an orbit currently planned in cislunar space, as a selenocentric orbit that will serve as a staging area for future missions.

European Space Agency, Published by PhysOrg. 19 July 2019.Halo orbit selected for Gateway space station. David Szondy, New Atlas. 18 July 2019. * Distant retrograde orbit (DRO): A stable circular retrograde orbit (usually referring to Lunar Distant Retrograde Orbit). Stability means that satellites in DRO do not need to use station keeping propellant to stay in orbit. The lunar DRO is a high lunar orbit with a radius of approximately 61,500 km. This was proposed in 2017 as a possible Gateway orbit, outside EM L1 and L2. *Decaying orbit: A decaying orbit is an orbit at a low altitude that decreases over time due atmospheric resistance. Used to dispose of dying artificial satellites or to aerobrake an interplanetary spacecraft. * Earth- trailing orbit, a heliocentric orbit that is placed such that the satellite will initially follow Earth but at a somewhat slower orbital angular speed, such that it moves further behind year by year. This orbit was used on the Spitzer space telescope in order to drastically reduce the heat load from the warm Earth from a more typical geocentric orbit used for space telescopes. * Graveyard orbit (or disposal, junk orbit) : An orbit that satellites are moved into at the end of their operation. For geostationary satellites a few hundred kilometers above geosynchronous orbit. * Parking orbit, a temporary orbit. * Transfer orbit, an orbit used during an orbital maneuver from one orbit to another. * Repeat Orbit: An orbit where the ground track of the satellite repeats after a period of time.  Pseudo-orbit classifications  A diagram showing the five Lagrangian points in a two-body system with one body far more massive than the other (e.g. the Sun and the Earth). In such a system, – are situated slightly outside of the secondary's orbit despite their appearance in this small scale diagram. * Horseshoe orbit: An orbit that appears to a ground observer to be orbiting a certain planet but is actually in co-orbit with the planet. See asteroids 3753 Cruithne and 2002 AA29. * Lunar transfer orbit (LTO) (accomplished with trans-lunar injection, TLI) * Mars transfer orbit (MTO) also known as trans-Mars injection (TMI) orbit * Halo orbits and Lissajous orbits: These are orbits around a Lagrangian point. Lagrange points are shown in the adjacent diagram, and orbits near these points allow a spacecraft to stay in constant relative position with very little use of fuel. Orbits around the point are used by spacecraft that want a constant view of the Sun, such as the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory. Orbits around are used by missions that always want both Earth and the Sun behind them. This enables a single shield to block radiation from both Earth and the Sun, allowing passive cooling of sensitive instruments. Examples include the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe and the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope. L1, L2, and L3 are unstable orbits[6], meaning that small perturbations will cause the orbiting craft to drift out of the orbit without periodic corrections. * P/2 orbit, a highly-stable 2:1 lunar resonant orbit, that was first used with the spacecraft TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) in 2018.

The name is derived from the Cree word for \\"meeting of the currents\\". The town's main economy is based on mineral mining, mainly gold mining, with some tourism. History Matachewan began as a trading post of the Hudson's Bay Company, called Fort Matachewan, located about north of the present town site. It consisted only of a large depot and stores, with a church added later on. The local First Nations, who traded their furs here, would camp along the Montreal River but not settle permanently. Jack Davidson discovered gold in 1916 and teamed up with Weldy Young in 1930 to start the Young Davidson Mines. Sam Otisse staked a claim next to Davidson in 1917, which became the Matachewan Consolidated Mines. Alex Mosher staked claims which became the Ashley Gold Mine (1932-1936). The impetus to the town's growth came in the 1920s when mineral deposits, such as gold, copper, and molybdenite, were found in the area. From then on it experienced boom and bust cycles of typical mining towns, depending on the swings in commodity prices, but its economy has gradually shifted to forestry and tourism. In January 1976, the Improvement District of Matachewan was formed, and in 1995, it was incorporated as a township. The Otisse Lake overflowed into mine tailings on 17 Oct. 1990, and 170,000 cubic metres of mine slimes entered the Matachewan River. In 2006, a medivac helipad was built to help accommodate the possibility of injuries that may occur at the Young- Davidson mine site. In 2008, an old and worn out wooden bridge over the Montreal River which was built in 1937 was replaced with a new steel-concrete reinforced structure for safety reasons regarding the heavy traffic to/from the mine. Geology Matachewan is on the southwest portion of the Abitibi greenstone belt and within the Abitibi gold belt. Between 1933 and 1957, the Young-Davidson Mine and the Matachewan Consolidated Mine produced 9.6 million tonnes of ore containing 3.1 grams of gold per ton and 0.93 grams per ton of silver. Between 1979 and 1980, Pamour Porcupine Mines Limited open-pit mining produced 18,000 tonnes of ore containing more than 3.4 grams per ton of gold.

Joseph Smith biography  Vogel was awarded the Best Book award in September 2004 by the John Whitmer Historical Association and the Turner-Bergera Best Biography award by the Mormon History Association in May 2005 for his biography Joseph Smith: The Making of a Prophet.\\"JWHA Awards\\" \\"MHA 2005 Award Winners\\" Vogel argues in the biography that Joseph Smith was a pious fraud—that Smith essentially invented his religious claims for what he believed were noble, faith-promoting purposes. Vogel identifies the roots of the pious fraud in the conflict between members of the Smith family, who were divided between the skepticism and universalism of Joseph Smith, Sr., and the more mainstream Protestant faith of Lucy Mack Smith. Vogel interweaves the history of Joseph Smith with interpretation of the Book of Mormon, which is read as springing from the young man's psychology and experiences.  Reception  Vogel's scholarship on the topic has been debated by Mormon apologists and scholars who have stated that he is critical of Mormon faith claims.\\"Dan Vogel's Family Romance and the Book of Mormon as Smith Family Allegory\\" He has also been criticized by ex-Mormons and anti-Mormons for not being sufficiently critical of Joseph Smith. Larry Morris praised his efforts to produce the multi-volume Early Mormon Documents. Many of Vogel's books have been critically reviewed by members of FARMS, a Mormon apologetics institute. For example, in 1991, Mormon religion professor and FARMS scholar Stephen E. Robinson suggested that Vogel's arguments closely resemble those of Korihor, an atheist polemicist in the Book of Mormon.Stephen E.

If activated to federal service, the Wing is gained by the United States Air Force Air Mobility Command. Mission The 161st Air Refueling Wing principal mission is air refueling. The wing enhances the Air Force's capability to accomplish its primary missions of Global Reach and Global Power. It also provides aerial refueling support to Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps aircraft as well as aircraft of allied nations. The wing is also capable of transporting litter and ambulatory patients using patient support pallets during aeromedical evacuations. Units The 161st Air Refueling Wing consists of the following units: * 161st Operations Group : 197th Air Refueling Squadron * 161st Mission Support Group * 161st Maintenance Group * 161st Medical Group History On 2 October 1957, the Arizona Air National Guard 197th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron was authorized to expand to a group level, and the 161st Fighter-Interceptor Group was established by the National Guard Bureau. The 197th FIS becoming the group's flying squadron. Other squadrons assigned into the group were the 161st Headquarters, 161st Material Squadron (Maintenance), 161st Combat Support Squadron, and the 161st USAF Dispensary. The new Group was assigned to the 34th Air Division, Air Defense Command, In 1958 the Group received from ADC the all-weather/day-night F-86L Sabre Interceptor aircraft, and in 1960, the 197th was one of three selected ANG units to receive F-104A Starfighter interceptors from the ADC active-duty interceptor forces. The Copperheads, as a result of the national recognition as one of the best air defense units in the US, were chosen to fly the new high performance jet fighter. The 161st FIG was called into active service in November 1961 as the construction of the infamous \\"Berlin Wall\\" pushed the world to the brink of war. Within a month after mobilization, 750 personnel and 22 187th FIS F-104 aircraft were in place at Ramstein Air Base, West Germany as the unit took up flying daily air defense patrols at the edge of the Iron Curtain. With world tension easing, the squadron returned home in August 1962. Transport mission With the return to Arizona, the unit was reassigned from ADC to the Military Air Transport Service (MATS) in October 1962. The Mach-2 Starfighters were exchanged for large, 4-engined C-97G Stratofreighters with a mission of worldwide transport of personnel, supplies and equipment. The 197th Air Transport Squadron (later Military Airlift Squadron) flew missions to the Caribbean, Europe, Japan, South Vietnam, Thailand and Australia. During the height of the Vietnam War, the squadron routinely flew trans-Pacific medical evacuation missions from hospitals in South Vietnam, Japan, and the Philippines of wounded servicemen and women to the United States, being designated as an Aeromedical Transport Squadron. In 1969 the Military Airlift Squadron designation was returned and the unit again flew scheduled transport missions for Military Airlift Command (MAC). Air Refueling In 1972, military requirements resulted in a change in mission when the group was reassigned from MAC transport duties to the Strategic Air Command (SAC). Under SAC the group became an Air Refueling unit, beginning with the air refueling version of the C-97 transport, the KC-97 Stratotanker. Familiarity with the aircraft led to a smooth transition from MAC to the new refueling mission. In 1977, SAC announced that Air National Guard refueling units would begin to upgrade to the KC-135 Stratotanker. The 197th Air Refueling Squadron has been flying the KC-135 for the past 35 years. A 161st ARG KC-135A with two Hawaii ANG F-4Cs in 1979 During the 1991 Gulf War, Air National Guard tanker units were quickly called into action. An around-the- clock airlift began to support the buildup to the conflict, Operation Desert Shield. Tankers and crews from the 161st were some of the first to arrive in Saudi Arabia. Elements of the 197th ARS were assigned to the 1709th Air Refueling Wing (Provisional), flying from King Abdul Aziz Air Base, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. From the start and for the duration, tankers servicing the conflict left Phoenix weekly, loaded with maintenance and support technicians who worked in the Saudi Arabian desert up to 45 days, and in some cases more. As the allies prepared to move against Iraq, aircraft crews, maintenance personnel, medics, fire fighters, security forces and food service technicians were dispatched to bases in Europe and the United States. Before the war in the Persian Gulf was concluded more than two-thirds of the force assigned to the 161st Air Refueling Group had served on active duty in some capacity to support the Middle East effort. In 1994, 1995 and 1997 the unit deployed to Pisa, Italy where our tankers supported NATO operations in Bosnia. 1997 also saw the 161st facing challenges in the United Arab Emirates. The unit was vital to the success of Operation Deny Flight and Operation Southern Watch. 1 October 1995, marked another key change in the unit's long history. The 161st Air Refueling Group was redesignated as the 161st Air Refueling Wing under the USAF Air Mobility Command (AMC). 1996 saw the Copperheads turn 50 years old. The unit celebrated with year-round contests and a 50th Anniversary Celebration in December. The 161st sent about 130 personnel to Operation Northern Watch early in 1999. Based at Incirlik Air Base, Turkey, the unit supported flight operations within the northern no-fly zone over Iraq. Early in the second quarter of 1999, 161st Copperheads were quickly pressed into service over Kosovo for Operation Allied Force. Nearly 200 unit airmen served on active duty for about two months, flying 125 missions to offload almost 2.5 million gallons of fuel. The airmen returned to Phoenix in late June 1999. Although not directly called as a unit the \\"Copperheads\\" played a vital role in support units during Operation Enduring Freedom in 2003. Many Security Forces saw duty overseas directly supporting bases while maintenance and operations personnel were called to support the ongoing operations. In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD (the Department of Defense) recommended the distribution of the 117th Air Refueling Wing's KC-135R aircraft from Birmingham International Airport Air Guard Station (AGS), Alabama and the 161st Air Refueling Wing, Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport AGS (two aircraft) and two other bases. Phoenix Sky Harbor (37) scored higher than Birmingham (63) in military value for the tanker mission. This recommendation would take advantage of available capacity at Phoenix by increasing the air refueling squadron size from eight to ten aircraft, increasing the wing's overall capability. It would also capitalize on the favorable recruiting environment of the greater Phoenix region that could sustain this increased squadron size.

History Oldest surviving building in Darwin Dragon (artist:Techy Masero) The gardens were established on their present site in 1886; this was the third attempt by European settlers of Darwin to establish a site where plants of economic importance could be tested for their suitability in the tropics. Initially the collection of the gardens was focused on economic gardening and the ornamental plantings. The gardens were severely damaged during Cyclone Tracy in 1974, 89% of all plants were lost. Restoration after the cyclone was led by George Brown, who had worked at the gardens since 1969 and served as curator from 1971 to 1990, and who was Lord Mayor of Darwin from 1992 until 2002. The gardens were renamed in 2002 to recognise George Brown's contribution and 32 years service to the development of the gardens. Fountain In 2000 Darwin's historic former Wesleyan Methodist church was moved from Knuckey Street and reconstructed at the Gardens. It is the oldest surviving building in Darwin. Today, the old church building houses Eva's Botanical Gardens Cafe. Collections The gardens contain a major collection of Northern Australian monsoon flora; these include communities like mangroves, monsoon vine thicket, Tiwi Islands wet forest and those found on the Arnhem Land escarpment. The gardens also has a large collection of native and introduced tropical plants including cycads, palms, Adansonia, gingers and heliconias.

California, 549 U.S. 270 (2007), held that the rule first announced in Apprendi v. New Jersey, , applies to California's Determinate Sentencing Law. In California, a judge may choose one of three sentences for a crime--a low, middle, or high term. There must exist specific aggravating factors about the crime before a judge may impose the high term. Under the Apprendi rule, as explained in Blakely v. Washington, , any fact that increases the punishment above that which the judge may impose without that fact must be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. In People v. Black, the California Supreme Court rejected the argument that under Blakely, the jury must find the additional facts necessary for the judge to impose the high term under the DSL. In Cunningham, the U.S. Supreme Court overruled Black, ruling that Blakely applies to California's determinate sentencing scheme. Facts After a jury trial, Cunningham was convicted of continuous sexual abuse of a child in Contra Costa County Superior Court, California. Under California's Determinate Sentencing Law (DSL), the authorized sentences for this crime are either 6, 12, or 16 years. Under the DSL, the judge must conclude first, that there are aggravating facts, and second, that the aggravating facts outweigh any mitigating factors, before imposing the high term. In this case, at a post-trial hearing, the judge found by a preponderance of the evidence that Cunningham's victim was particularly vulnerable and that his conduct was violent, making him a danger to the community. The judge then concluded that this aggravating evidence outweighed the fact that Cunningham had no criminal history, and sentenced Cunningham to the high term of 16 years. The California Court of Appeal affirmed. The California Supreme Court denied review because it had recently held, in People v. Black, that the DSL was constitutional under Blakely v. Washington. Cunningham asked the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case, and it agreed to do so. California's Determinate Sentencing Law The primary development in sentencing law that gave rise to this case was the shift away from indeterminate sentencing and toward determinate sentencing. Under an indeterminate sentencing scheme, statutory law provides for a wide range of authorized sentences, such as \\"five years to life\\" for burglary. The power to determine the length of time a criminal actually spends in prison rests with a parole board or other prison officials, rather than with the courts. In the 1970s, California replaced its indeterminate sentencing system with a determinate sentencing scheme. In a determinate sentencing scheme, statutory law fixes authorized sentences of discrete lengths, and requires courts rather than prison officials to justify which of those discrete sentences is appropriate in any given case. California enacted its Determinate Sentencing Law (DSL) in 1977, in the hopes of achieving greater uniformity in sentencing and ensuring that punishment was proportional to crimes. For most crimes, the DSL specifies three authorized sentences--a low term, a middle term, and a high term. The trial judge was required to impose the middle term unless there were aggravating or mitigating circumstances--facts found by the trial judge to exist by a preponderance of the evidence and which must be placed on the record in open court. A group of California judges had come up with a nonexhaustive list of aggravating and mitigating factors; judges were also free to rely on any fact reasonably related to the crime. The DSL also forbade judges to rely on any fact that was already an element of the crime in order to impose the high term. Majority opinion In Apprendi v. New Jersey, the Court ruled that any fact that increases a defendant's punishment above the statutory maximum punishment must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. In Blakely v. Washington, the Court ruled that, for purposes of the Apprendi rule, the \\"statutory maximum\\" is the greatest sentence the judge may impose based solely on the facts found by the jury. Blakely and United States v. Booker, for example, involved sentencing schemes in which the judge was required to impose a sentence within a range determined both by the crime of conviction and additional facts. In those schemes, if the judge chose a sentence above that range, or chose one from a higher range, the facts that allowed the judge to do so had to be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Under California's DSL, the middle term is the \\"statutory maximum\\" sentence for Blakely purposes. The DSL required judges to impose the middle term unless aggravating factors were found to exist, and those aggravating factors by definition did not include any element of the crime. Thus, the maximum sentence the judge could impose based solely on the jury's findings was the middle term, not the high term. Nevertheless, in People v. Black, the California Supreme Court held that the DSL survived Blakely intact because the DSL merely set forth a sentencing range within which the judge was allowed to exercise his traditional discretion to impose an appropriate sentence. The Black court concluded that the DSL was merely a legislative attempt to provide guidance to trial courts in selecting appropriate aggravating factors on which to base a high-term sentence. But this does not justify \\"shield[ing] a sentencing system from the force of\\" Blakely. The Black court also reasoned that the DSL did not violate Blakely because, overall, it reduced sentences vis-à-vis the indeterminate sentencing scheme. Furthermore, the Black court noted that under California law, sentencing enhancement, which are distinct from aggravating factors, did have to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. These two differences, it reasoned, meant that the DSL survived Blakely. But Apprendi set forth a bright-line rule that did not tolerate \\"trivial\\" incursions in the name of preserving the \\"basic\\" jury-trial right of the criminal defendant. Nor could the DSL survive because it was functionally indistinguishable from the post-Booker sentencing scheme in place for federal crimes. Just as federal judges have discretion to impose a \\"reasonable\\" sentence by referring to a set of broad criteria, the Black court reasoned, California trial judges have broad discretion to impose a sentence within a predetermined range. But this characterization of the DSL was not accurate, for California had adopted \\"sentencing triads, three fixed sentences with no ranges between them. Cunningham's sentencing judge had no discretion to select a sentence within the range of 6 to 16 years. Her instruction was to select 12 years, nothing less and nothing more, unless she found facts allowing the imposition of a sentence of 6 or 16 years. Factfinding to elevate a sentence from 12 to 16 years, our decisions make plain, falls within the province of the jury employing a beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard, not the bailiwick of a judge determining where the preponderance of the evidence lies.\\" The \\"reasonableness\\" standard operates within the Sixth Amendment constraint, not as a substitute for it. It was up to California to tailor its sentencing scheme to conform with the Court's decision, just as other states had conformed their sentencing schemes to conform with Apprendi and Blakely. Some states allow the jury to make the necessary findings during trial; others do so in a post-trial sentencing hearing; still others \\"have chosen to permit judges genuinely to exercise broad discretion within a statutory range, which, everyone agrees, encounters no Sixth Amendment shoal.\\" Dissenting opinion Justice Alito saw no difference between the DSL and the post-Booker sentencing scheme in place for the federal courts. \\"Both sentencing schemes grant trial judges considerable discretion in sentencing; both subject the exercise of that discretion to appellate review for \\"reasonableness;\\" and both--the California law explicitly, and the federal scheme implicitly--require a sentencing judge to find some factor to justify a sentence above the minimum that could be imposed based solely on the jury's verdict.\\" If the post-Booker scheme had won the approval of a majority of the Court, why should the DSL not also garner such a majority? Alito pointed out that all members of the Court agreed that the indeterminate sentencing scheme in place for federal crimes would satisfy the Blakely rule, and that a purely advisory Guidelines system would do so as well. The characteristic that persuaded a majority of the Court to approve the current federal sentencing scheme, consisting of sentencing guidelines ranges from which trial judges were permitted to depart, was the fact that all sentences were subject to appellate review for \\"reasonableness.\\" All of these systems require trial judges to make factual findings on some level of generality. Under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, these findings were somewhat specific; under the indeterminate sentencing scheme, they were not. Yet in both schemes the judge makes findings that allow them to impose an appropriate sentence. Similarly, the DSL afforded California trial judges sentencing discretion with respect to the \\"general objectives of sentencing,\\" which included protecting society, punishment, encouraging the defendant to lead a law-abiding life, deterring the defendant from committing other crimes and deterring others from committing crimes at all, incapacitating the defendant during his incarceration, providing restitution to victims, and promoting uniformity in overall sentences. The sentencing decisions of California trial judges, just as those of federal trial judges, were subject to review for \\"reasonableness.\\" In light of these similarities, Alito concluded that the majority's reasoning was flawed. A California trial judge's decision to impose a high-term sentence was not necessarily a fact-based decision; it could be entirely policy-based, and policy-based decisions have always been left to judges. Because the decision to impose a high-term sentence was not based on facts, the Apprendi rule did not apply to it. Even if they were, Alito felt that \\"reasonableness\\" review was a sufficient constraint on the power of trial judges to choose sentences within prescribed ranges. Some sentences, after all, will be found to be unreasonable, and hence unconstitutional, because they will not be sufficiently supported by appropriate facts. If the remedial majority in Booker approved this scheme for the federal system, it should also pass constitutional muster when used in California.  Effect of the decision  Seventh Circuit Chief Judge Frank H. Easterbrook noted in an opinion that an argument that since Cunningham's decision, \\"district judges no longer may find facts that affect federal sentences ... has become popular.\\" The Seventh Circuit rejected that argument: :Cunningham holds that California’s determinate sentencing law violates the sixth amendment, as understood in [Apprendi, Blakely and Booker], by granting the judge rather than the jury the power to find facts that raise the maximum lawful sentence. [It is] contend[ed] that Cunningham applies to the federal Sentencing Guidelines as well as to California’s system. ... [However,] Booker solved th[e] [federal sentencing guidelines'] constitutional problem by making the Guidelines advisory. Given that adjustment, findings of fact under the Guidelines no longer determine statutory maximum sentences. Cunningham therefore has no effect on post-Booker federal practice[,] [insofar as] District judges remain free, as the remedial portion of Booker instructs, to make findings of fact that influence sentences, provided that the sentence is constrained by the maximum set by statute for each crime.

California"},{"id":"9622517","text":"Goesaert v. Cleary, 335 U.S. 464 (1948), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court upheld a Michigan law, which prohibited women from being licensed as a bartender in all cities having a population of 50,000 or more unless their father or husband owned the establishment.. Valentine Goesaert, the plaintiff in the case, challenged the law on the ground that it infringed on the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. Speaking for the majority, Justice Felix Frankfurter affirmed the judgment of the Detroit district court and upheld the constitutionality of the state law. The state argued that since the profession of bartending could potentially lead to moral and social problems for women, it was within the state's power to bar them from working as bartenders. Only when the owner of the bar was a sufficiently close relative to the women bartender could it be guaranteed that such immorality would not be present. The decision was subsequently overruled by Craig v. Boren..  Background  As part of the Michigan system for controlling the sale of liquor, bartenders were required in all cities having a population of 50,000 or more, but no female would be so licensed unless \\"the wife or daughter of the male owner\\" of a licensed liquor establishment, under Section 19a of Act 133 of the Public Acts of Michigan 1945, Mich.Stat.Ann. 18,990(1). Valentine Goesaert was the owner of a bar in the city of Dearborn, Michigan. According to Michigan law, she was not allowed to be the owner of a bar since the population in Dearborn exceeded 50,000. On November 20, 1947, Goesaert and her daughter challenged the Michigan law at the district court of Detroit before Circuit Judge Simons and District Judges Levin and Picard. The women were represented by attorney Anne R. Davidow. They argued that the law denied them equal protection of the laws and deprived them of their property without due process of law. The main arguments brought forth by Goesaert were as follows: # An arbitrary standard of 50,000 was set as the population of any city to come under the act. # Women owners of bars were discriminated against. # Women bartenders were discriminated against. # There was a discrimination between daughters of male and female owners. # There was a discrimination between waitresses and female bartenders. Judges Levin and Simons ruled in favor of Cleary et al., denying all of the plaintiffs' claims: \\"the power of the Legislature to make special provisions for the protection of women is not denied.\\" On the other hand, Picard dissented, citing two reasons. First, he thought that the law violated Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment because it discriminated between persons similarly situated, denied plaintiffs equal protection of the laws, and was \\"palpably arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable, and not based on facts that can reasonably be conceived.\\" Second, the plaintiffs should be permitted to present evidence before the court acted on the interlocutory injunction.  Decision  After losing in the District Court, Goesaert appealed to the Supreme Court. The women were once again represented by Anne R. Davidow. Edmund E. Shepherd represented the appellees, Cleary et al. Goesaert et al. once again presented their arguments against the law by focusing on the claim that Michigan could not restrict females from being barmaids and at the same time make an exception, in favor of the wives and daughters of the owners of liquor establishments. Justice Frankfurter delivered the opinion of the court, which upheld the Michigan law. He first cited the historic tradition of the regulation of liquor traffic, which forbid all women from working behind a bar. Although he pointed out that women had begun to \\"achieve the virtues that men have long claimed as their prerogatives,\\" the Constitution \\"does not require legislatures to reflect sociological insight, or shifting social standards.\\"Goesaert, 335 U.S. at 466. He went on to explain that the Constitution does not require situations which are different in fact or opinion to be treated in law as if they were the same by citing Tigner v. State of Texas.. Since the ownership of a bar by a barmaid's husband or father minimized hazards of social and moral problems that would otherwise be present for women, the legislature needed not go to the full length of prohibition with the appearance of two distinct groups of women. In the name of protecting women from moral and social dangers in the bar, the law was upheld by the majority. Justice Rutledge authored a dissenting opinion, which was joined by Justices Douglas and Murphy. They argued that the law arbitrarily discriminated between male and female owners of liquor establishments. Justice Rutledge presented the opinion by saying, \\"This inevitable result of the classification belies the assumption that the statute was motivated by a legislative solicitude for the moral and physical well-being of women who, but for the law, would be employed as barmaids. Since there could be no other conceivable justification for such discrimination against women owners of liquor establishments, the statute should be held invalid as a denial of equal protection.\\"Goesaert, 335 U.S. at 468 (Rutledge, J., dissenting).  Aftermath  Although the Michigan law was deemed discriminatory towards women, the case made a precedent for the Supreme Court to look more closely at legislature with discrimination based on gender. In his argument, Frankfurter relied on the rational basis test for equal protection legislation. With the test, the court asked \\"whether it is reasonable for state purposes to treat two classes of people differently.\\" The key was that as long as the court declared that the state had a justifiable reason to enact a law, the law would be held. By applying the rational basis test to the question of equality in gender-based legislation, Frankfurter opened the door to further state legislation that distinguished between the genders. Afterward, there were many cases that used his criteria to uphold laws that made distinctions between gender. By the 1970s, however, attitudes began to shift. The Supreme Court found an Idaho law to be unconstitutional for on its discrimination against women in Reed v. Reed, when the court struck down a law that preferred men over women for appointments as administrators of estates.. That was a dramatic change to the Supreme Court's approach to the application of equality for men and women.

Throughout the middle to later Edo period, Komine Castle was home to the Abe clan, daimyō of Shirakawa Domain. It was also referred to as or simply . The castle is one of the 100 Fine Castles of Japan, and in 2007 was designated a National Historic Site. It should not be confused with the older Shirakawa Castle also located in Shirakawa, Fukushima, also known as or . The castle grounds are also a noted venue for viewing sakura in spring. Layout Komine Castle is located on a long and narrow hill extending 500 meters from east to west, located on a bend of the Abukuma River, which forms part of the natural defenses of the site. The Shirakawa area and the Abukuma River is the on the main route between the Kantō region and northern Japan, the Ōshū Kaidō, and control of this area was of great strategic importance. The ancient Shirakawa Barrier was once located nearby. The inner bailey is at end of this hill separated into two layers of enclosures, protected by tall stone walls. At the northeastern corner, was a three-story yagura which substituted for a true tenshu. Along the north and west lines were huge earthen ramparts using portions of the original terrain. South of the inner bailey, protected by a wide water moat, was a secondary enclosure approximately 200 x 100 meters which contained the residence of the lord. There were a number of enclosures outside this core area, forming secondary fortifications. The east side of the castle was further protected by outer barrier. History=Early history The construction of Komine Castle began in 1340 by Yūki Chikatomo, is a small hilltop fortification with earthen palisades. After the fall of the Satake clan in 1589, the Yūki allied with the Date clan to the north, but were dispossessed in 1590 by Toyotomi Hideyoshi. The Yūki survived as retainers to the Date, and their territory became part of the holdings of Aizu Domain under the Gamō clan. Under the Gamō, Shirakawa Castle was modernized with stone walls. The castle was held by the Gamo until 1627. Edo period After the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate, Niwa Nagashige was transferred from Tanagura Domain to become daimyō of the newly created 100,000 koku Shirakawa Domain in 1627 and completely rebuilt and expanded Komine Castle between 1628 and 1632. During the remainder of the Edo period, the castle passed through the hands of seven daimyō clans with a total of 21 daimyō (the Niwa, Sakaibara, Honda, three branches of the Matsudaira clan and finally the Abe clan) before reverting to direct control of the Tokugawa shogunate in 1866, on the eve of the Boshin War. During this period the most famous ruler of Shirakawa was Matsudaira Sadanobu (1759-1829). Bakumatsu to modern era During the Boshin War, Shirakawa was a stronghold of the pro-Tokugawa Ōuetsu Reppan Dōmei and came under attack during the Battle of Aizu by the pro-imperial army of the Satchō Alliance. Although the invading army was outnumbered, it had superior artillery, and Komine Castle had been designed primarily to defend against attacks from the north, so its southern approached were more lightly fortified. The castle fell to the Meiji government on May 1, 1868. Many of the structures of the castle were destroyed during the battle, and much of what remained, including a large section of its stone walls, were later pulled down following the abolition of the han system. The site was transformed into a public park. In 1991, a three-story tenshu was reconstructed on the foundations of the original tenshu, and in 1994 one of the gates was restored. These structures (along with some of the stonework and the moats) suffered significant damage during the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake.

The film was released on January 18, 2008. Plot Two dumb blondes, Dee Twiddle (Pamela Anderson) and Dawn St. Dom (Denise Richards), meet each other at their first lesson in flight school. Dee is a professional dancer who has breast implants and a gassy pet turtle named Virgil. Dawn is a former secretary who has tried to be a dancer. After meeting with each other in flight school, they take off in their plane without the instructor. When they notice that it's their first lesson, the blondes panic and crash into a golf course. The blondes survive the crash with no injuries. The blondes eventually become friends and they notice that they have been neighbors for nearly a year. Dee decides to help Dawn get a dancing gig at the Beaver Patch Lounge. Meanwhile, the Vancouver Italian Mafia decides to whack Lou Rimoli, a former mafia member and current informant, who is running the Beaver Patch Lounge. Rimoli is being protected by two agents. The Godfather of the mob sends two female assassins, Cat (Emmanuelle Vaugier) and Kit (Meghan Ory) to whack Rimoli. The assassins succeed. However, Rimoli is murdered right before Dee and Dawn's audition. The Mobsters, Leo (Kevin Farley) and Swan (John Farley) were supposed to monitor what was happening, after seeing Dee and Dawn run from the club, they mistake the blondes for being the infamous assassins Cat and Kit.

Hazzard is a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly representing Wakehurst for the Liberal Party since 1991. Hazzard has previously served as the Minister for Planning and Infrastructure and the Minister Assisting the Premier on Infrastructure NSW in the O'Farrell government between 2011 and 2014; as the Attorney General of New South Wales and the Minister for Justice between 2014 and 2015 in the first Baird ministry; and as the Minister for Family and Community Services and the Minister for Social Housing between April 2015 and January 2017 in the second Baird government. Background and early career Hazzard was educated at Manly Boys' High School (now Manly Selective Campus), Macquarie University where he gained a Bachelor of Arts (Science) and a Diploma of Education, the University of New South Wales where he graduated Bachelor of Laws, and the University of Sydney where he graduated Master of Laws. Hazzard was then employed as a science teacher (1974–1977) before being admitted as a solicitor in 1977. He was a partner in a Manly law firm from 1981 to 1996. Political career In 1983, Hazzard joined the Liberal Party and quickly rose through the ranks, becoming regional president and a member of the state executive from 1985 to 1986. Hazzard was pre-selected as Liberal Party candidate for Wakehurst in April 1991, ahead of the sitting Liberal Party member John Booth. He was elected to NSW Legislative Assembly in 1991 and sat in the backbench during the Greiner and Fahey governments. Hazzard played a role in the 'Metherell affair', involving the neighbouring Member for Davidson, Terry Metherell, who upon his resignation from the Liberal Party had expressed to Hazzard his interest in one of the Directorships at the new Environmental Protection Authority. Hazzard discussed this with Premier Greiner and the Minister for the Environment, Tim Moore, at Greiner's residence in February 1992. Greiner and Hazzard then discussed the matter with Metherell while in Parliament ten days later. The government subsequently created the job for Metherell, which he accepted, effectively engineering a vacancy in a seat that the Liberal Party would recover at a by-election. At the May 1992 by-election the Labor Party did not nominate a candidate, and a field of Independents and minor parties reduced the Liberal vote by 16 points (14 points after preferences), nevertheless won by Liberal candidate Andrew Humpherson. NSW Opposition After the Labor Party won the 1995 election, Hazzard was appointed to the Opposition frontbench and held various shadow portfolios. Under Opposition Leader Peter Collins, Hazzard was Shadow Minister for Corrective and Emergency Services (1995–96), Environment (1996–1997), Aboriginal Affairs (1996–2007), and Sport and Recreation (1997–99) Under Kerry Chikarovski he was Shadow Minister for Housing (1999–2000), Corrective Services (1999–2000), Disability Services and Ageing (2000–03), and Community Services (2000–03). Under John Brogden he was Shadow Minister for Energy and Utilities (2003–05), Science and Medical Research (2003–05), Youth (2005), and Community Services (2005). Under Peter Debnam and Barry O'Farrell he was Shadow Minister for Education (2005–07) and was made Shadow Minister for Redfern Waterloo (2007–08). He was also appointed Shadow Minister for Planning (2008–11) and Shadow Minister for Infrastructure (2008–11). Between 2007 and 2011 Hazzard criticised the State Labor Government's move to take planning powers away from Local government and handing them to government-appointed planning panels and their attitudes towards development of heritage areas. NSW Government In April 2011 Hazzard was appointed Minister for Planning and Infrastructure and Minister Assisting the Premier on Infrastructure NSW. He also served as Leader of the Legislative Assembly from April 2011 to April 2014. Due to the resignation of Barry O'Farrell as Premier, and the subsequent ministerial reshuffle by Mike Baird, the new Liberal Leader, in April 2014 Hazzard was sworn in as the Attorney General and as the Minister for Justice; and lost the portfolio of Planning and Infrastructure. In April 2015, following the 2015 state election, Hazzard was sworn in as the Minister for Family and Community Services and the Minister for Social Housing in the second Baird ministry. Following the resignation of Baird as Premier, Gladys Berejiklian was elected as Liberal leader and sworn in as Premier. The Berejiklian ministry was subsequently formed with Hazzard sworn in as the Minister for Health and the Minister for Medical Research with effect from 30 January 2017. Following the 2019 state election the two portfolios were merged as the Minister for Health and Medical Research. Personal life Hazzard has two adult sons.

The building contains the Nobu Hotel Miami Beach. It was designed by Morris Lapidus in the Miami Modern style, and was completed in 1955–56. Renovated in 2008, the hotel has 621 guest rooms, including 96 suites. It was built on the site of the Warner Estate following litigation over development rights to the site and to the neighboring Firestone Estate, which became the Fontainebleau Hotel. Design Morris Lapidus designed the Eden Roc for a site immediately to the north of his Fontainebleau Miami Beach hotel built in 1954. The hotel was designed for Harry Mufson, who was a then-estranged former partner of Fontainebleau owner, Ben Novack, who together had previously created another Miami Beach landmark hotel (the design of which Lapidus did not initiate, grant completed) located about a half-mile to the south, the Sans Souci (which opened in 1949). The Eden Roc site had previously been the Warner Estate, owned by Albert Warner of the Warner Brothers. Mufson told Lapidus \\"I don't want any of the French stuff you used at the Fontainebleau. That's for kids.\\" Novack was infuriated at both Lapidus and Mufson for building the Eden Roc, then considered one of the most elegant and luxurious hotels of its time, and retaliated in 1961 by building a blank 14-story North Tower as a \\"spite wall\\" on the Fontainebleau property to shade the Eden Roc's pool. All rooms faced south, and the side facing the Eden Roc consisted of an unpainted and unsightly \\"eye sore,\\" in which the sole window, an oceanside penthouse on the north side, belonged to Novack, which he created for the purpose of \\"keeping an eye on\\" Harry and his guests at the Eden Roc. Mufson sued Novack in what would become one of the most acrimonious, personal legal architectural battles in Miami Beach history. personal, Mufson family archives (Richard Mufson) and the book, \\"The Eden Roc Story\\";Shulman, Robinson, Donnelly, p. 318 Hotel crest and sign At the Eden Roc, Lapidus avoided the sweeping curves of the Fontainebleau, choosing instead a more formal composition reminiscent of earlier Miami Beach hotels. The hotel is surmounted by a large finned enclosure bearing the hotel's signs. An addition on the south side of the Eden Roc property was built to cover the spite wall and new pools were built in unshaded locations. The hotel was named after the Eden Roc pavilion at the Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc in Antibes, France. The hotel housed the Cafe Pompei, a supper club that offered entertainment with dinner. The Mona Lisa Room was an intimate formal dining room, and Harry's American Bar was the hotel's nightclub (not named after the hotel owner, Harry Mufson, but rather a famous bar – considered by many an institution – in Venice, Italy, and a name Morris Lapidus borrowed for the storied nightclub within the Eden Roc). Recent history The hotel was restored in 1997 by architects Spillis Candela and Partners, and expanded in 2006. Marriott International began operating the hotel in 2005 under its Renaissance Hotels & Resorts brand as the Eden Roc Renaissance Miami Beach, under a fifty-year contract.

It was intended to be an intermediate trainer employed for pilot training between the de Havilland Tiger Moth primary trainer and the North American Harvard advanced trainer. Although it served with the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan, the Fort was redundant and was used to train wireless (radio) operators and had a relatively short operational career. Design and development The Fort was originally designed as an advanced flying trainer and in 1940 orders were placed for 200 to be built for the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. The Fleet 60 was designed as a monoplane with a low elliptical wing and a raised rear cockpit. An unusual feature was the fixed undercarriage. Although fixed, the undercarriage was fitted with a retractable fairing. This feature was intended to familiarize student pilots with an undercarriage retraction mechanism but without causing external damage by a forgetful student. Production was delayed, however, as the first Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) model was not flying until 18 April 1941. The availability of the Fairchild Cornell, and a change in what constituted an \\"advanced\\" trainer, led to the contract's being sharply cut back, and only 101 Forts were ultimately delivered to the RCAF between June 1941 and June 1942. Operational history Fleet 60K Fort at the Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum, Hamilton, Ontario Initially, the RCAF did not want to order the Model 60K, and their concerns proved valid. Pilot trainees found the Fort relatively easy to master, thereby making it unsuitable for transition to combat aircraft (e.g., Hawker Hurricane). Also, the RCAF decided that pilots who had soloed in Fleet Finches and de Havilland Tiger Moths could proceed to Harvards without training on Forts. The Forts were then used to train wireless operators at No. 2 Wireless School, Calgary and No. 3 Wireless School, Winnipeg. Two models were built, one having a Jacobs engine and the other having a Jacobs. The more powerful engine gave the revised Fort a top speed of and the cruising speed . It then climbed at per minute and had a range of . Loaded weight was slightly increased to . The last Forts saw active service in 1944 and they were phased out of use by 1945; the last Model 60K was retired in 1946.

The story centres on various realms, legions, heroes, knights, and sorcerers, while intermingling love and romance within battles between good and evil. Overview At first the story is that of a general of a legion at war with a neighbouring realm. As the story unwraps the reader learns of the frightening, emotional, and yet all too exciting life of Wyl Thirsk. Throughout the series a twist of magical elements is introduced and guides the life of the main character.  Charts and Maps  *Wyl Thirsk’s Transformations: The Quickening trilogy gets its name from a curse that is bestowed on the main character. Myrren, the last living witch, possesses a power that she gives to Wyl as he witnesses her death. As Wyl is the only person kind to her, she tells him that she will give him a \\"gift\\" that will avenge her and grant him power. This power is said to prevent Wyl from dying, while instead causing him to take on the body of his murderers until he has become who he was destined to be. *Inside of every book cover there is an overview map of the kingdoms.  Theme/Analysis  Many times during the novels the reader can interpret a situation or conversation as having more than a surface meaning. In her own words, McIntosh's style is summed up thus: > \\"My leading characters are usually thrown into torrid circumstances, needing > to live by their wits, and I need them making very human errors of judgment > now and then. It steps up the tension and gives the reader good reason to go > back for more to find out how these characters, that they're now helplessly > involved with, solve their dilemmas. By making my characters experience lots > of emotions, lots of hurdles, forcing them to essentially dig themselves out > of horrendous situations by their own cunning and intelligence, it stops > them being fantastical characters of magic and allows the reader to relate > very strongly with them. Magic is increasingly my backdrop to a story rather > than having individual characters wielding it too much or too often.\\" Works in the series=Myrren's Gift (2003) All Wyl Thirsk ever wanted was for his family to be happy, to be loyal to his monarch, King Magnus, as his father was and, most importantly, to follow in the footsteps of his father, Fergys Thirsk.

Founded as a company in 1886, the company traded under the name of Silver Spring Mineral Water Company until it changed ownership in 2009; it was subsequently sold by Privet Capital in 2010. The new entity in turn hit trouble in 2012 and was liquidated in early 2013. It produced the drink brands Perfectly Clear and Rola Cola along with own label brands for supermarket chains. History The Silver Spring Mineral Water Company was founded in Folkestone in 1888 as a carbonated soft drinks manufacturer. Originally located at Grace Hill, Folkestone, towards the end of the 1890s the company expanded and moved to larger premises in Foord Rd. In 1946 Silver Spring bought and merged with another local firm, the Harris of Hythe Company. Further consolidation of the local market came in 1969 when Silver Spring took over Star Mineral of Whitstable. In 1970 it moved again to a new facility on the Park Farm Estate. During the following decade it created the Rola Cola and Spring Up brands. The company became the first company in Great Britain to begin production of P.E.T. 2-litre bottles in 1982, and shortly after commenced own label production for the supermarkets. On 6 May 1995, the company introduced the Perfectly Clear brand of flavoured mineral water. Within two years Perfectly Clear became the 4th best selling carbonated drink in the UK. In 2008 the company was reported as producing more than 250m bottles of drinks per year. Despite the success of Perfectly Clear, the family-owned company was entered into administration on 16 September 2009 by Deloitte LLP. The company's assets were subsequently purchased by venture capital firm Privet Capital and renamed as Silver Spring Soft Drinks Company Ltd, which continued the sale of the Silver Spring products. Silver Spring Soft Drinks Company Ltd in turn entered administration in October 2012, with production ceasing in December 2012 ahead of the company being finally wound up. Drinks company CBL Drinks acquired Silver Spring's former brands in 2013.http://www.morningadvertiser.co.uk/Drinks/Beer/Perfectly- Clear-1870s-mixers Products Silver Spring products were commonplace throughout Kent, and many (including its 'Perfectly Clear' flavoured water range) were distributed nationwide. Certain lines were, however, distributed only in Kent, thus the company had a very local feel to it. Although many of its products were generic in nature (cola, mineral water, etc.) it produced one line which is believed to be unique, the soft drink Bing, which was widely drunk in Kent. The company's lemonade was known by the distinctive product title Spring Up. Silver Spring had been operating from Folkestone since 1870, and as a Company since 1886, and remained independent until its final years. It retained many traditional features, for example, manufacturing its own bottles, both glass and plastic, and claimed to have the United Kingdom's last glass drinks bottle manufacturing plant. In 2007, Silver Spring took over production of Virgin Cola.

The history of Georgetown University spans nearly four hundred years, from the early European settlement of America to the present day. Georgetown University has grown with both its city, Washington, D.C., and the United States, each of which date their founding to the period from 1788 to 1790. Georgetown's origins are in the establishment of the Maryland colony in the seventeenth-century. Bishop John Carroll established the school at its present location by the Potomac River after the American Revolution allowed for free religious practice. The role of the Society of Jesus in the school's operation has evolved from that of founders and financiers to faculty and advisers. Their focus on liberal studies and religious pluralism have helped to give the school its identity. Georgetown was also affected by its times, including the American Civil War, which disrupted the growing school and significantly changed its student body. University presidents like Patrick Francis Healy modernized the institution into an active research university with several graduate and undergraduate schools, and oversaw the expansion of educational opportunities on campus, around the city, and abroad. Founding alt=An arched stone doorway with five carved seals above it. The history of Georgetown University traces back to two formative events, in 1634 and 1789. Until 1851, the school used 1788, the start of construction on the Old South building, as its founding date. In that year a copy-edit in the college catalog began mislabeling the construction as beginning in 1789. This was discovered in preparation for the centennial celebration in 1889, at which point rather than correct the annual, the date of Georgetown's foundation was fixed to the date January 23, 1789. First establishments On November 22, 1633 Jesuits Andrew White, John Altham Gravenor, and Thomas Gervase set sail on The Ark for British North America under the leadership and financing of the Lord Baltimore, Leonard Calvert. Their landing on March 25, 1634 on St. Clement's Island marks the birth of the Maryland colony, this anniversary now celebrated as Maryland Day. These Jesuits were joined in 1637 by Thomas Copley and Ferdinand Poulton, together establishing near St. Mary's City some means of Christian education for the indigenous Yaocomico people. Inquiring about patronage for their school, Poulton wrote to Vincenzo Carafa, the Superior General of the Society of Jesus in Rome under Pope Urban VIII, who on September 15, 1640 approved the institution of a school in principle. That year they moved to a permanent building at Calverton Manor on in the Wicomico River. This early establishment was burnt in 1645 as part of the English Civil War, and the remaining Jesuits were brought to trial in England. The new Protestant administration had their school outlawed, though it was functioning by 1648, when Thomas Copley managed to return there. Newtown Manor, also known as \\"Bretton's Neck\\", near modern- day Leonardtown, Maryland, become available to the Jesuits in 1677. This house served as the Jesuit schoolhouse until 1704 when its existence was alerted to British authorities. The school afterward conducted itself periodically and in secrecy at the new Jesuit colony of Bohemia Manor. John Carroll attended this school from 1745 until 1748. Carroll then left for studies in Europe. He joined the Jesuits in 1753, and was ordained in 1769, but in 1774 Pope Clement XIV ordered the suppression of the Jesuit order, forcing Carroll to return to Maryland. This put Carroll in the right place at the right time, when the American Revolution pushed out the English administration, opening up new possibilities for scholastic expansion. Georgetown Heights alt=A painting of an elderly, balding, priest wearing a gray robe and a large cross necklace sits, facing left, in front of a brown curtain and bookshelf. After returning in 1774 to live on the Rock Creek in Maryland, Carroll established Saint John the Evangelist Church, in Silver Spring, Maryland. In 1776, his cousin, Charles Carroll, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, invited John to join him, Samuel Chase, and Benjamin Franklin in traveling to Quebec and attempt to persuade the French Canadian population to join the revolution. The mission was unsuccessful, but John Carroll's association with Benjamin Franklin proved useful. In 1784, Franklin, as ambassador to France, recommended Carroll to the papal nuncio in Paris as the head of the Catholic Church in America, and on June 9, 1784 Carroll was anointed Superior of Missions in the United States of North America. On November 6, 1789 Carroll's authority was confirmed after being elected by the clergy as the first Bishop of Baltimore. Beginning in 1783, Carroll convened meetings of area clergy, mostly ex-Jesuits, at Sacred Heart Church in White Marsh, outside Annapolis, Maryland. This body, known as the General Chapters, resolved on November 13, 1786, that \\"a school be erected for the education of youth\\" and that the location for the school would be in Georgetown. The site was influenced by Carroll's experience with Jesuit colleges in Europe, which were located in urban centers. Port towns were used by Jesuits because of their missionary focus. By March 1787, they formed a fund raising committee, and Carroll solicited formal proposals for an \\"academy, at George-town, Patowmack-River, Maryland.\\" The District of Columbia's borders wouldn't be defined until the passage and implementation of the Residence Act in 1790. Georgetown Academy On April 24, 1787, Georgetown landowner John Threlkeld donated a plot of land to Carroll, which was ultimately where he founded Holy Trinity Church. In April 1788, construction began at a larger neighboring plot on Georgetown's first building, later called \\"Old South\\", leading Carroll to write \\"We shall begin the building of our Academy this summer. On this Academy are built all my hopes of permanency and success of our holy religion in the United States.\\" On January 23, 1789, John Carroll, Robert Molyneux and John Ashton completed the purchase from Threlkeld and William Deakins, Jr. for \\"seventy five pounds current money\\" of the acre and a half on which construction had already started. This land became the core of Georgetown's campus. As a result, the University celebrates this date as its founding. Carroll had difficulty filling the position of president of the Academy, with many candidates declining the job before Robert Plunkett first took the office in 1791, though he only served 18 months. He oversaw the division of the Academy into \\"college\\", \\"preparatory\\", and \\"elementary\\", with the youngest starting at age eight. Jean-Edouard de Mondésir became the first teacher in late October 1791, and the first student, William Gaston, was enrolled on November 22, 1791. Classes commenced on January 2, 1792, with around 69 students attending in its first year. Georgetown's second building, Old North, which survives to this day, began construction in 1794. At three times the size of Old South, it greatly increased the number of classrooms and sleeping space on campus. Upon the building's completion under President Rev. William Matthews, George Washington visited and spoke from the porch, a position since reserved for U.S. Presidents. Early growth Archbishop alt=A painting of a priest with thin brown hair facing his left in front of a parted curtain that reveals a series of buildings in the background. In its early years, Georgetown suffered from considerable financial strain, relying on private sources of funding and the limited profits from local farms that had been donated to the Jesuits by wealthy landowners. Some of these farms included African slaves. By September 1792, tuition had to be increased for the first time. In 1796, Louis William Valentine Dubourg arrived and became president. Dubourg brought with him a collection of books from his own collection and others from St. Mary's Seminary, the Baltimore Society of Saint-Sulpice, and these books formed the nucleus of Georgetown's library. On January 1, 1798, Dubourg released the first prospectus to advertise the college abroad, but also drove the school into debt by hiring numerous new faculty, including fencing teachers, and by buying silver and a school piano. The first board of directors organized in 1797, and quickly became antagonized with Dubourg because of his spending and preference for French faculty, particularly during the Quasi-War. The board forced him to resign in December 1798. Beginning in 1798, Leonard Neale and his brother Francis Neale oversaw the growth of the university as presidents for a combined eleven years. At Carroll's request, Neale was also appointed coadjutor bishop by Pope Pius VI in 1800. In 1799 Neale invited three sisters of the Order of the Visitation of Holy Mary to open a monastery at Georgetown. On June 24, 1799, the young Georgetown Visitation Monastery under Mother Teresa Lalor began a Saturday school for young women. This developed into an academy, now Georgetown Visitation Preparatory School, in 1802. Leonard Neale remained as president of Georgetown until 1806 when he was succeeded by Robert Molyneux, who died in 1808. Leonard Neale's brother, Francis Neale, then became president of Georgetown College in 1809. alt=A black and white drawing of two colonial style buildings, one two stories, the other three, perched on a hill. When the suppression of the Society of Jesus in Maryland ended in 1805, several former Jesuits rejoined, including Leonard Neale, and Carroll commenced a series of agreements to ensure Jesuit involvement in the school. Carroll however never rejoined the Society. In 1806 the school began a novitiate for Jesuit recruits moving from Russia, which had harbored the Society during the suppression. Carroll didn't seek civil recognition for Georgetown until after the suppression of the international Society ended in 1814. Instead of a state charter, he went to the federal government, then directly in charge of the District of Columbia. William Gaston, now a Congressman, sponsored the legislation for a congressional charter, which passed the Thirteenth Congress and Georgetown received the first federal university charter on March 1, 1815, signed into law by President James Madison. This allowed Georgetown to grant academic degrees, and the college's first two recipients, a pair of brothers from New York City named Charles and George Dinnies, were awarded the degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1817. Graduate degrees were first awarded in 1821, and other Jesuit schools conferred degrees under Georgetown's charter for many years afterward. In 1833, the Holy See empowered Georgetown to confer degrees in philosophy and theology. Founder John Carroll died December 3, 1815, at age eighty, and in his will he left Georgetown four-hundred pounds sterling, which marked the beginning of Georgetown's endowment. In 1830, construction of an infirmary in the new Gervase Building brought the first hospital beds to Georgetown. In 1838, school presidents Thomas F. Mulledy and William McSherry organized the sale of 272 slaves from a Jesuit-owned tobacco plantation in Maryland to a plantation in Maringouin, Louisiana, and funds from that sale were used to repay debts from recent school expansion. Upon completion of the sale, the holding of slaves by the Maryland Jesuits came to an end. Mulledy was later disciplined in Rome by the Jesuit Society for ignoring their order to keep families of slaves intact. The slaves were shipped to the Deep South in the domestic slave trade, sold primarily to two sugar cane plantations. Some of the money was also used to found two Catholic high schools in New York City and Philadelphia, as the Jesuits saw a demand for urban ministry to serve the increasing number of immigrants from Europe, including Catholics from Ireland.Kathryn Brand, \\"The Jesuits' Slaves\\", The Georgetown Voice, 8 February 2007, accessed 25 April 2016 On June 10, 1844, the growing school was reincorporated by Congress under the name The President and Directors of Georgetown College. Georgetown's Observatory, completed in 1844, was used in 1846 to determine the latitude and longitude of Washington, D.C., which was the first such calculation for the nation's capital. In 1849, four Catholic doctors frustrated with what they felt were discriminatory practices at neighboring Columbian College petitioned Georgetown President James Ryder to found a medical program. A building for this purpose was purchased at 12th and F Streets, and the School of Medicine was founded in 1850, holding its first classes the following year. Early student life alt=A line graph of years from 1791 to 1888 with three subjects, the first in blue representing the Academy and College rises up from 69 in 1791 to 333 at its peak in 1857 followed by sudden drop and leveling around 200. The second, in red, represents the Medical School and begins in 1851 quickly peaking at 127 and then falling again while the third, in yellow, represents the law school which begins in 1871 and steadily rises to 168. From its beginning, Georgetown was not intended to be exclusively Catholic, and over its first ten years, nearly one-fifth of students were Protestant. A fifth of students were also from the Caribbean. By 1830, Jewish students were known to be attending. European immigrants and Napoleonic War refugees also made up significant parts of the early student body. School rules were harshly enforced. Leonard Neale, a strict moralist, regulated students' movements such that founder John Carrol accused him of running Georgetown \\"on the principles of a convent.\\" There were three student organized rebellions against the Georgetown administration in the antebellum period. The most notable of these occurred in January 1850, against the administration of James A. Ryder over the school food. Students damaged the dormitories and took charge of a local hotel. The first student society, the Sodality of Our Lady, was founded in 1810 as a religious devotional group. A strict revision of school rules in 1829 forbade personal conversations or particular associations. Despite this the Philodemic Society was founded in 1830 as the school's debating and literary society, the oldest of its kind in America and the oldest secular group at Georgetown. Other debating societies were founded in its model, or in opposition to it in later years, such as the short lived Philisorian Society and the Philonomosian Society, which lasted from 1839 until 1935. The College Cadets were officially organized in 1836, becoming the oldest military unit native to the District of Columbia. The Dramatic Association of Georgetown College, renamed the Mask and Bauble Dramatic Society after World War I, was founded in 1852, and is itself the oldest surviving student dramatic society in America. The first Christmas tree was introduced to campus in December 1857. The Civil War alt=Eleven soldiers idly lining the shore of a river. On the opposite bank, connected by a bridge, are short buildings along the river and on top of a hill. The Civil War was an important and tragic time for the University. Beginning on December 11, 1859 the Philodemic Society debated whether or not the southern states should secede. The debate lasted weeks, and after the Society affirmed secession, a brawl ensued, and debates were canceled for the rest of 1860. Fist fights on campus between northern and southern students soon became common. Beginning in 1861, many students left their studies to join the war. 925 students ultimately enlisted with the Confederate Army and 216 with the Union Army; between them 106 died in the war. Enrollment dropped from 313 students in 1859 to only 17 late in 1861. By 1862, Georgetown only had 120 total students, about ten percent of what it was just a few years earlier. Only seven students graduated in 1869, down from over 300 a decade prior. Responding to lack of adequate hospital beds and housing for soldiers needed to protect the District, the Union commandeered University buildings, and by the time of President Abraham Lincoln's May 1861 visit to campus, 1,400 Union Army troops were stationed in temporary quarters there. Of these 1,300 were from the 69th Infantry Regiment, which established itself in Maguire Hall from May 4, 1861 to June when the unit was replaced by the 79th New York Volunteer Infantry. The occupation ended in July when the unit left to fight in the First Battle of Bull Run, but the university remained home to soldiers as an infirmary for the remainder of the war. Student alt=A young man looking sour and facing right. He is dressed in a jacket, bow tie, and wide-brimmed hat, and his shirt is partially unbuttoned. Georgetown would later be connected to the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. Several of John Wilkes Booth's conspirators had associations to Georgetown: David Herold, who accompanied Booth in his escape, attended the school between 1855 and 1858 and received a certificate in pharmacology in 1860, while Samuel Arnold, who conspired with Booth to kidnap Lincoln, attended in the mid-1840s, and Dr. Samuel Mudd, who set Booth's broken ankle following the assassination, studied medicine between 1851 and 1854. Charles H. Liebermann, one of the founders of the medical school, was among the doctors who treated Lincoln the night he died. The war drastically changed Georgetown, making it both more northern and more Catholic. Increasingly larger percentages of the student body came from northern cities, more populated with Catholic immigrants, while the student body had been primarily southern before the war. This dynamic is expressed in Georgetown's official school colors. In 1876, Georgetown College Boat Club, the school's rowing team, adopted blue, from the uniform of the Union Army, and gray, from the uniforms of the Confederate States military forces, as their team colors in order to signify the peaceful unity between students from the North and those from the South. Students at Georgetown Visitation wove the first blue and gray uniforms for the team. Georgetown's motto Utraque Unum, \\"both into one,\\" though used before the war, helped capture the unity spirit. Expansion The University in 1874 In 1874, Patrick Francis Healy became president of Georgetown University, becoming the first African American president of a predominantly white university. Healy's influence on Georgetown was so far-reaching that he is often referred to as the school's \\"second founder.\\" He modernized the curriculum by requiring courses in the sciences, particularly chemistry and physics. Healy and his successors sought to bind the professional schools into a university, and concentrate on higher education. The most visible result of Healy's presidency was the construction of a large building begun in 1877 and first used in 1881, later named Healy Hall in his honor. alt=The upper-body of a middle-aged male looking slightly to his right. He wears the black robe and white collar of a Catholic priest A school of law was approved by the Board of Directors in March 1870, and graduated its first students in 1872. In 1884 the \\"Law Department\\" moved to 6th and F Streets, N.W., not far from the Medical School, and then again in 1891 to 506 E Street, N.W. In 1870, Georgetown raised the raise the minimum age of enrollment at Georgetown Preparatory School from eight to twelve. This was raised again in 1894 to thirteen. As part of the focus on higher education, Georgetown Preparatory School relocated from campus in 1919 to nearby North Bethesda, Maryland, and fully separated from the University in 1927. Georgetown Visitation Preparatory School has remained attached to the university campus, and while independently run, the two occasionally share facilities. Georgetown Law moved to 506 E Street in 1891, and the sign from this building is preserved at the law school's current campus on Capitol Hill.alt=A rectangular, Victorian-style brick building with several trees and three cars from circa 1920 in front Numerous new schools were founded during the twentieth century. The School of Foreign Service (SFS) was founded in 1919 by Edmund A. Walsh to prepare students for leadership in foreign commerce and diplomacy. Following World War I, the U.S. Army created the Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) and the Georgetown Corps of Cadets was reorganized into the Hoya Battalion. The Institute of Languages and Linguistics (ILL - later renamed School of Languages and Linguistics - SLL) was organized in 1949 and the School of Business was created out of the SFS in 1957. New developments also came to School of Medicine. In 1898, Georgetown University Hospital was first established on campus. Georgetown obtained the Washington Dental College in 1901, and integrated it with the medical school. In 1903, Georgetown University began an undergraduate medical program with the School of Nursing. A new Medical-Dental Building on Reservoir Road was completed in 1930 and classes then moved to the main campus. In 1951 the School of Dentistry separated from the School of Medicine as an independent unit of Georgetown University.] On October 4, 1966, Congress passed a bill that recognized the school's name as \\"Georgetown University\\" for the first time. The 1844 bill in effect until then had referred only to \\"Georgetown College\\", which at that point was known as the College of Arts and Sciences and was just one branch of the university. In 1970 Lauinger Library was also completed, bringing space for a rapidly growing library collection. In 1971, following the completion of the Bernard P. McDonough Hall, the law school moved to its present location at 1st and F Streets at 600 New Jersey Avenue. Across borders John Thompson and Patrick Ewing meet with Ronald Reagan after winning the 1984 National Championship.alt=Two tall African-American men, one in a suit, one in a gray basketball uniform, stand behind a shorter elderly white male in an ornate room, with each man holding a basketball. The 1960s saw major changes in administration as well as in the student body. Female students have been admitted to the School of Medicine since 1880, to the School of Nursing since its founding, to the Graduate School since 1943, and to the School of Foreign Service since 1944. While most of the university was made available to women on a limited basis by 1952, it wasn't until the College of Arts and Sciences welcomed its first female students in the 1969–1970 academic year that Georgetown became fully coeducational. Freshmen hazing rituals, long tolerated by the administration, were banned in 1962 after one student brought suit against the school for injuries he sustained. President Lawrence C. Gorman phased out restrictions on attendance by African Americans, and Samuel Halsey Jr. became the first black undergraduate in 1950. The Black Student Alliance was formed in 1968, and in 1969 Georgetown named the first black member of the Board of Directors since Patrick Francis Healy. Modern Georgetown is largely a product of substantial changes during the 1980s. In 1982, the School of Foreign Service moved into its new home in the Edward B. Bunn S.J. Intercultural Center. The 1984 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament championship by Georgetown's men's basketball team helped make Georgetown University a household name with stars such as Patrick Ewing and Dikembe Mutombo under Coach John Thompson. Georgetown ended its bicentennial year of 1989 by electing Leo J. O'Donovan as president. He subsequently launched the Third Century Campaign to build the school's endowment. In December 2003, Georgetown completed the campaign, joining twenty other universities worldwide to raise at least in a single fund drive. The campaign supported financial aid, academic chair endowment, and new capital projects. In 1987, the University decided to close the School of Dentistry following the class of 1990 for financial reasons, as the number of dental students dropped nationwide. Supplies and equipment from the school were sent to Pontifical Xavierian University in Bogotá, Colombia.] In 1994, the School of Languages and Linguistics was folded into the College, and is now the Faculty of Languages and Linguistics. On October 7, 1998, the School of Business was renamed the McDonough School of Business in honor of alumnus Robert Emmett McDonough and in 2009, it moved into the newly constructed Rafik B. Hariri Building. In 1999 the School of Nursing added three other health related majors and appended its name to become the School of Nursing and Health Studies. alt=A balding white male seated behind a microphone wearing a typical suit and red tie.

DeGioia has continued its financial modernization and has sought to \\"expand opportunities for intercultural and interreligious dialogue.\\" In October 2002, Georgetown University began studying the feasibility of opening a campus of the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service in Qatar, when the non-profit Qatar Foundation first proposed the idea. The School of Foreign Service in Qatar opened in 2005 along with four other U.S. universities in the Education City development. That same year, Georgetown began hosting a two- week workshop at Fudan University's School of International Relations and Public Affairs in Shanghai, China. This later developed into a more formal connection when Georgetown opened a liaison office at Fudan on January 12, 2008 to further collaboration. DeGioia also founded the annual Building Bridges Seminar in 2001, which brings global religious leaders together, and is part Georgetown's effort to promote religious pluralism. In 1974, Woodstock College was refounded as the Woodstock Theological Center on Georgetown's campus. The Center for Contemporary Arab Studies was opened on September 3, 1975 with grants from Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and Mobil Oil. In 1993 the Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding was opened and after a $20 million grant from Saudi Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal in 2005, the center was renamed the \\"Prince Alwaleed Center for Muslim–Christian Understanding\\". The Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs was begun as an initiative in 2004, and after a grant from William R. Berkley, was launched as an independent organization in 2006. Additionally, The Center for International and Regional Studies opened in 2005 at the new Qatar campus. Fictional depictions The \\"alt=A long steep staircase with a stone wall on the left and a painted red brick wall on the right. Georgetown, as a major world university, has been featured in many media over the years. The most prominent example is the 1971 horror novel, The Exorcist, written by William Peter Blatty, who received an English degree from Georgetown in 1950. The novel is loosely based on a series of 1949 exorcisms conducted on a fourteen- year-old boy at Georgetown University Hospital, nearby Maryland, and in St. Louis, Missouri. In 1973, Blatty's bestselling novel was made into a film, also titled The Exorcist. Like the novel, the film was set at Georgetown and filmed on campus during the fall semester in 1972. The climatic scene uses a steep staircase between Prospect Street and Canal Road, previously know popularly as the \\"Hitchcock Steps\\" for their spooky appeal. However, since the film's release they have been called the \\"Exorcist steps.\\" The 1985 \\"Brat Pack\\" film St. Elmo's Fire also revolved around a group of students who had just graduated from Georgetown. The bar that much of the film takes place in is based on The Tombs, a bar and restaurant known for its large student clientele and rowing decòr, located one block from Georgetown's front gates in a historic university owned house. Georgetown denied the producers the rights to film on campus, so parts of the film were shot at the nearby University of Maryland, College Park. Additionally, Georgetown University has been a destination for characters in films such as Above the Rim, Save the Last Dance, Election, and The Girl Next Door, as well as television shows such as The Sopranos and The West Wing, which also filmed scenes on campus. The film Memento was written by Jonathan Nolan, a Georgetown alumnus, and the main character's nemesis, John G., is said to be named after John Glavin, a full professor of Victorian literature and screenwriting in Georgetown's Department of English.

Before that he was mayor since 1996 of Chicoutimi, which since amalgamation in the province is the major borough of the new city.Catherine Delisle, \\"Jean Tremblay élu maire : Le règne d'Ulric Blackburn prend fin après seize ans\\", Le Quotidien, 3 November 1997, p. 3Denis Bouchard, \\"Une victoire de tous les citoyens\\", Le Quotidien, 26 November 2001, p. 4 Tremblay is from the Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean region of Quebec. He is a notary by profession and a businessman. After the municipal reorganizations in Quebec, on 1 January 2002 he became the first magistrate of the new city of Saguenay. The popular mayor had his mandate renewed in the elections of November 2005,\\"Jean Tremblay vainqueur\\", Le Quotidien, 7 November 2005, p. 1 receiving 72% of the vote, and again in November 2009 with 78% support, described as a \\"dazzling victory.\\"Sylvain Dufour, \\"Victoire éclatante pour Jean Tremblay\\", Le Quotidien, 1 November 2009. In the election of 2013, he received 63% of the vote. Tremblay has worked to promote the economy of Saguenay, initiating actions to attract more cruise ships, as well as support development of the city and industries. He worked to recover taxes owed by private hydroelectric plants within the city, as they were exploiting a city resource. In 2008 he was the first mayor of a major Quebec city to implement a new form of municipal management called « Gestion par activités » (City Stat Performance Strategy). He established the position of city ombudsman to serve residents. His administration initiated what was the city's first interactive website on the Internet, to improve communication and services for residents. In addition, the mayor's office makes use of social media such as Facebook and Twitter for communication. While introducing technological innovation, Tremblay has been culturally conservative. He continued his practice of saying a prayer before city council meetings. The Commission on Human Rights ruled this violated freedom of conscience and religion after citizen complaints. The case was ultimately heard by the Canadian Supreme Court. In Mouvement laïque québécois v Saguenay (City) (2015), the court ruled that the prayers before city council meetings were unconstitutional, as the state had an obligation to be neutral, and ordered the city to end them and to pay damages. Biography Jean Tremblay was born in 1948 in Chicoutimi and attended local schools. He obtained a law degree from Université Laval in 1974. He received his diploma in notary law from the same university and became a member of the Chamber of Notaries of Quebec in 1975. He became a practicing notary in Chicoutimi in 1975. In 1979, he became partner in a St-Hubert restaurant in Chicoutimi. He was also the majority shareholder in a real estate company from 1979 to 1997. He taught in the Department of Administrative Sciences University of Quebec at Chicoutimi during the 1980-1981 school year. Municipal mayor  With a wide network, Tremblay decided to enter politics and was elected in 1996 as mayor of the city of Chicoutimi, serving from 1997 to 2001. Tremblay strongly supported the 21st-century merger of seven municipalities (Chicoutimi, Jonquière, La Baie, Laterrière, a portion of the territory of Canton-Tremblay, Lac Kénogami and Shipshaw) into a new city, later named Saguenay. His office issued the document entitled Le courage de changer les choses (The Courage to Change Things), to explain the benefits of creating the new city of Saguenay through improved administration and cost savings, and gained the support of regional voters for the measure. Following the municipal reorganizations in Quebec, on November 25, 2001 Tremblay was elected mayor of the new city of Saguenay, which incorporated Chicoutimi and several other jurisdictions. In 2002, Trembly founded Promotion Saguenay, to help develop the regional economy by stressing the area's strengths. The same year he became a member of the Union of Quebec Municipalities (UMQ). He has sat on the executive committee from 2004. In early 2002, he held a referendum on the name of the new city. On April 12, 13 and 14, citizens chose between two proposed names, Chicoutimi and Saguenay. Saguenay received 35,810 votes (52.23%) to Chicoutimi's 32,399 votes (47.26%) and became the official name.Isabelle Labrie, \\"Nom de la future ville: Saguenay l'emporte de justesse\\", Le Quotidien, 15 April 2002, p. 3 In 2004, Tremblay established the position of city ombudsman, as a central point for citizens seeking redress. In 2005, he launched a case against multinationals to recover payment of taxes on private hydroelectric dams on the territory of the city. In 2006, he reaffirmed his support for reciting a Catholic prayer before City Council meetings. This became a highly controversial issue (see section below).\\"Saguenay mayor defends Catholicism at accommodation hearings\\", CBC, 21 September 2007 In 2007, Tremblay began promoting a port of call for cruise ships in the borough of La Baie. This has led to an increase of cruise ships and associated tourist business. [archive] In April 2009, the polling firm Influence Communication, hired by Le Journal de Quebec, published a study on the media weight of 11 mayors in Quebec. On this list, Jean Tremblay ranked third after Régis Labeaume, Mayor of Quebec; and Gérald Tremblay, Mayor of Montreal. Among the 11 mayors included in the survey, he received 7.5% of the local, national and international media coverage. 32% of this coverage concerned the regional economy and related issues, and 26% concerned the controversy over prayer and religious symbols at public meetings and facilities. Tremblay was the first mayor of a major Quebec city to implement a new form of municipal management called « Gestion par activités » (City Stat Performance Strategy).François Bourque, « Le modèle de Saguenay », Le Soleil, 29 mars 2008, p. 2 The implementation of this new model has enabled Saguenay to make substantial cost savings and improve the efficiency of municipal services. He has presented this strategy on many occasions to other municipalities.Stéphane Bégin, « Des sourires approbateurs de ses pairs », dans Le Quotidien, 26 avril 2008, p. 3 In November 2009, Mayor Tremblay and the City of Saguenay were fined over half a million dollars by the superior court of Quebec, to be paid to Bertrand Girard, the former general manager of the city, for 'wrongful dismissal' by Tremblay. Judge Yves Alain criticized Mayor Tremblay and said his testimony was rife with \\"hesitations and contradictions;\\" he said certain parts were \\"pure science fiction\\". Judge Alain said none of the reasons given by the mayor for his decision to fire Girard was valid; in his opinion the mayor was trying to hide a personal animosity toward Girard. In October 2010, the regional Saguenay- Lac-Saint-Jean of the Federation of Professional Journalists of Québec published a black fileSection régionale de la FPJQ, « Dossier noir de l'information municipale au Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean [archive] », Fédération professionnelle des journalistes du Québec, 14 octobre 2010 on the municipal information in Saguenay. The eight journalists from different media reported intimidation in their trying to collect data and alleged that records were altered; they said that the city administration and Mayor Tremblay threatened the freedom of the press.\\"Information municipale — Un dossier noir dénonce Jean Tremblay\\" [archive] sur http://www.radio-canada.ca [archive], Société Radio-Canada, 15 October 2010 The next day, the mayor said, \\"The black file, it does not bother me too much.

Since October 2012 Mayor Tremblay has been on Twitter. =Prayer of the City Council= In September 2006, Christian Joncas and Alain Simoneau, activists from the Mouvement laïque québécois (MLQ) and the Coalition of Citizens of Saguenay, filed a complaint with the Commission on Human Rights and Youth Rights (CDPDJ) against Mayor Jean Tremblay for reciting a short prayer at the beginning of each Saguenay City Council meeting. Tremblay had practiced this tradition as mayor of Chicoutimi. The municipal prayer reads: > \\"Almighty God, we thank you for the great blessings which You have given to > Saguenay and its citizens, including freedom, opportunities for development > and peace. Guide us in our deliberations as members of City Council and help > us to be well aware of our duties and responsibilities.

It was gathering information on how cultural, ethnic and religious minorities are and should be accommodated in the province under existing law. His paper defended the traditional place of the Catholic religion in public life in Quebec, where 95% of the people identify as Catholic. Community participation in church life has declined. This paper, published online in Les Classiques des sciences sociales, generated controversy.François St-Gelais, \\"Les gens s'arrachent le mémoire! : Jean Tremblay à la commission Bouchard-Taylor\\", Le Quotidien, 26 September 2007 texte intégral [archive] On May 15, 2008, the CDPDJ (Commission on Human Rights) ruled that the prayers at Saguenay City Council meetings violated provisions for freedom of conscience and religion in Quebec and Canadian society. With the support of the City Council, the mayor continued his practice. In August 2008, supported by the MLQ, Alain Simoneau filed a civil suit, claiming $100,000 in damages and fees for extrajudicial rights abuses and violation of freedom of religion and conscience. Simoneau asked that the city stop the practice of prayers at city meetings, and that it remove religious symbols in municipal spaces: a statue of the Sacred Heart in a public room used by the Chicoutimi district, and a crucifix from the boardroom of the Bay district.\\"Avis au Procureur général du Québec\\" [archive] sur http://www.alarielegault.ca [archive], 27 novembre 2008 In February 2011, the Court of Human Rights ordered Jean Tremblay and city of Saguenay to stop the prayer, to remove the religious symbols from the public rooms of city facilities, and to pay 30 000 CAD as damages to Simoneau.\\"Droits de la personne -Plus de prière au conseil municipal de Saguenay\\" [archive] sur http://www.radio-canada.ca [archive], Société Radio-Canada, 14 février 2011 The mayor said he intended to appeal the ruling, and with the city council launched a fundraising campaign for donations to take the case to the Canadian Supreme Court.\\"Vous voulez faire un don dans le dossier du procès de la prière à Saguenay\\" [archive] sur http://www.ville.saguenay.qc.ca [archive], 2011Jeanne Corriveau, « Prière au conseil municipal — Saguenay en appel [archive] », Le Devoir, 23 février 2011 This case was covered nationally, and the mayor attracted wide media coverage.

[archive] Tremblay argued that the prayer was part of the Catholic heritage of Quebec. On April 12, 2015 the Supreme Court ruled unanimously in Mouvement laïque québécois v Saguenay (City) against Tremblay and the city, saying recitation of the prayer at the municipal meeting was unconstitutional because of freedom of conscience and religion. It said the state had an obligation to be neutral, and \\"This neutrality requires that the state neither favour nor hinder any particular belief, and the same holds true for non-belief. It requires that the state abstain from taking any position and thus avoid adhering to a particular belief.\\"\\"Prayers at Quebec city council meetings violate constitutional rights: Supreme Court\\", National Post, 15 April 2015, accessed 17 October 2015 It did not address the religious symbols, as it said the Tribunal had not ruled on this, and the Appeals Court was in error to make a ruling about their use.SCC, Mouvement laïque québécois v Saguenay (City) (2015), par. 53SCC, Mouvement laïque québécois, par. 61 Media relations Tremblay has frequently appeared on regional television stations and provincial governments.

The term comes from hālau, literally, \\"long house, as for canoes or hula instruction\\"; \\"meeting house\\", and hula, a Polynesian dance form of the Hawaiian Islands. Today, a hālau hula is commonly known as a school or formal institution for hula where the primary responsibility of the people within the hālau is to perpetuate the cultural practice of hula. Description There is great variation between hālau. Some focus primarily on ancient styles of hula, others on modern styles, and some study both. Some hālau continue to preserve very strict kapu, sacred protocols, while others are noa, or free of kapu. The styles of hula taught in different hālau also can vary greatly. Styles are passed down from kumu to haumāna, and knowledgeable students of hula can tell which hula lineage is represented by watching the dancer's presentation.  Physical space  Traditionally, a hālau was constructed as a sacred space and dedicated to the god Laka. Although Hawaiians had many gods, within a hālau Laka was important as evidenced by the kuahu, or altar, which stood in the hālau space and required constant care. The kuahu was adorned with greenery in honor of the Gods, song-offerings and pule, or prayers, were also offered to this sacred dwelling space within the hālau. The location of hālau today vary widely, from the kumu's home to community centers, to the lawns of parks. Hālau hula can be found wherever there is space and a company or troupe of hula students. Internal structure The internal structure of a hālau hula can vary quite a bit, generally these are led by a kumu hula, or master teacher, whose position is roughly equivalent to that of a headmaster.The kumu is responsible for maintaining the integrity of the style and traditions handed down to them by their kumu, during their hula training. Their kuleana, or responsibility, is therefore to uphold the training and discipline of their haumāna through a perpetuation of their hālau traditions.The kumu is also responsible for the spiritual integrity of the hālau, and is responsible for instructing students in the proper care and protocol of the hālau, which includes their physical well-being by teaching good exercise, dietary, and hygienic practices. Within a hālau there are typically two classes of performers. The ʻōlapa, or dancers, who, like the ʻōlapa tree (or cheirodendron trigynum) dance with agility and bend gracefully alikened to the motion of the leaves of the ʻōlapa. Along with the hoʻopaʻa, or steadfast class of performers. The hoʻopaʻa are responsible for instrumentation and typically chant and dance with their instruments while sitting or kneeling, accompanying the ʻōlapa dancers. Typically, this role was for students with more experience and maturity. The poopuaa, or head student, is often the kumu's protégé, and under the direction of the kumu oversees the protocol and rituals of the hālau. The alakai or \\"guides\\" act as teaching assistants, with the more advanced effectively being student teachers. Alakai often will assist less experienced haumāna with their lessons, and coach them with the more difficult steps and moves. Kōkua or helpers assist in a variety of areas, from lei making, to helping other haumāna dress, making phone calls, fund raising, and helping alakai coach less experienced students. Haumāna, the students, range in age from toddlers to senior citizens. History Prior to European contact, the Hawaiian language had no word for \\"school\\", as the concept of a specialized place of instruction did not exist in Hawai\`i prior to the arrival of Christian missionaries. Education came from parents, aunts, uncles, and elders, while children who showed promise in a specialized art or craft would be apprenticed to a master and work in the latter's hālau. In ancient times, students joining a hālau hula would be dedicated solely to the study of hula for the duration of their training. Their families would provide maintenance for the support of the hālau. Hālau hula training was strict, with haumāna put on kapu or rules and codes of conduct which banned the cutting of hair and the practicing of any kind of sexual activity. Today, students have set hours for study at the hālau, and often pay monthly dues to help the kumu with support and maintenance. Present-day hālau hula each have their own set of rules for their haumāna, with many still enforcing the traditional rule of not cutting one's hair. Each year, the distinctive styles of each hālau can be seen at the Merrie Monarch Festival held in Hilo. Hālau are judged on individual (Ms. Aloha Hula) and group performances in categories for kāne (men) and wāhine (women). Winners are recognized for their performances of kahiko (traditional), ʻauana (contemporary) and an Overall Festival Winner is recognized. Curriculum Four basic steps are commonly used in all hālau hula, and each of the steps has many variants. All of the basic steps in hula require the shoulders to remain steady and both knees to be in a bent position at all times. *Kaholo or travel step – usually consists of four beats. This step is probably one of the most common, especially for beginning students of hula, when a mele or song is danced. The kaholo is often the dance step used during the \\"vamp,\\" musical measures between the verses of songs. *Hela – a step occupying a one beat count and requires one to point out one foot at a time in front of one's body. The foot slides forward just above, and parallel to, the ground in a graceful point. *Uwehe – this is done by lifting and setting back one foot then elevating both heels and pushing the knees forward rapidly.

USSF began the U.S. Cup in 1992 and it was played annually until 2000, except for the World Cup years of 1994 and 1998. The cup used a round-robin format in which the team with the highest number of points took the title. The four teams included the host United States, along with Mexico, Colombia and Nigeria. This was the first year that these three invited teams participated in a U.S. Cup. The U.S. won the title for the second time this year. June 11: US vs. Nigeria Both teams had new coaches coming into the game. While the Nigerians had performed well at the 1994 World Cup, it was missing many of its top players from that competition while the U.S. had most of its veteran core intact. Alexi Lalas, one of the vocal leaders of the U.S. team, arrived just hours before the game after a trans-Atlantic flight from Italy. He made the last minute trip in order to play in his club side’s vital win to avoid relegation. The Nigerians showed well early, going on the attack from the opening whistle. In the 8th minute, Jay-Jay Okocha ran unmarked across the top of the box with the ball, shooting into the goal. While John Harkes countered with a long range shot of his own, the Nigerians continued to run at a shaky U.S. defense. In the 19th minute, U.S. defender Mike Burns attempted to clear shot a cross, but instead put it into the path of Taiwo Wasui to score from 8 yards. Burns redeemed himself when Marcelo Balboa, earning his 100th cap in this game, headed in a goal off his free kick just before the half. In the second half, the U.S. defense gradually came to grips with the Nigerian offense, while the U.S. began to exploit seams in the Nigerian defense. Several U.S. players wasted good opportunities until Cobi Jones scored off an Earnie Stewart feed in the 87th minute. The Nigerians continued to press for the tying goal and almost had it, but Lalas cleared a shot off the goal line.

The Auckland shag is a colonial nester, building sizeable nests of, among other items, grass, twigs and seaweed. The Auckland shag lays three pale blue-green eggs in November–February. The incubation period is 26–32 days. The Auckland shag is considered Vulnerable by the IUCN due to its small population size and restricted global range. Only around 2000 Auckland shags exist in their remote habitat. Some taxonomic authorities, including the International Ornithologists' Union, place this species in the genus Leucocarbo. Others place it in the genus Phalacrocorax. The binomial name of this bird commemorates the naturalist William Colenso.

The Selangor State Park (, also known as Taman Warisan Negeri Selangor) is a park located in Gombak District, Selangor, Malaysia. The 914.41 square kilometre park was gazetted on by the state on January 25, 2007. Upon its establishment, it became the second largest park in Peninsular Malaysia with the largest being the Taman Negara. It is over 108,000 hectares in size and is the third-largest park in Peninsular Malaysia. The area was gazetted in 2007 as a state park under the National Forestry Act Enactment 2005 of Selangor and is managed by the Forestry Department of Selangor. Role of the Park Selangor and the Federal Territories of Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya depend on the Park for their most basic needs of clean air, water and maintenance of the local climatic stability. The Park thus helps to guarantee the quality of life enjoyed by these communities. Protecting Water Resource The forests of Taman Negeri Selangor protect and are catchment for water contributing to the upper reaches of all major rivers in Selangor. These rivers are Sungai Bernam, Sungai Selangor, Sungai Klang and Sungai Langat. The Park area also feeds the five water-supply reservoirs that provide 98% of the water supply to Selangor, Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya. These dams are the Sungai Selangor, Batu, Klang Gates, Langat and Semenyih dams. Ecologically, Taman Negeri Selangor helps to maintain the biodiversity in the river basins and preserve the water quality of the rivers. Reducing Downstream Floods The forest cover of Taman Negeri Selangor provides the important ecological function of natural flood mitigation for Selangor, Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya. The forests absorb moisture through plant roots and sponge up large quantities of rainfall in their organically enriched soil system. Thus, the Park serves in water catchment and also as a natural buffer against flooding that is typically most felt in settlements and population centres farther downstream. The natural forest also helps to reduce soil erosion and sedimentation of the reservoirs. Protecting Steep Slopes The majority of the State Park is highland over 300 meters above sea level, with steep slopes greater than 25 degrees. This environmentally sensitive area is particularly vulnerable to soil erosion and landslides. The thick forest, together with the leaf litter and other organic debris, help reduce the direct impact of rain on the soil. The extensive root systems of natural vegetation hold the soil in place. A Centre for Eco-tourism, Research and Education The Park area provides many recreational opportunities, and it also caters to valuable educational and research activities. As one of the most accessible forest areas in Malaysia, the Park provides an invaluable retreat from the pressures of modern urban lifestyles (e.g. at Ampang Recreational Forest). The Park attracts activities of two major international research centres existing within or near its area, the University of Malaya Field Studies Centre in Hulu Gombak with its incredible forested backdrop, and the Forest Research Institute of Malaysia (FRIM) in Kepong. Biodiversity The Park area, rich in fauna and flora, is significant in maintaining existing levels of biodiversity resources. The wealth of the biodiversity of the Park also contributes to Malaysia’s classification as one of the mega-biodiversity countries in the world. Documented within the Park are: * much of some 3140 vascular plant species recorded for Selangor are now conserved * 114 mammal species have been documented * 355 bird species can be found * 104 freshwater fish species have been recorded * 202 reptilian and amphibian species occur The Klang Gates Quartz Ridge Resembling the back of a dragon, the Klang Gates Quartz Ridge is a world-class geological wonder and a key feature of the Selangor State Park. Made up entirely of white milky quartz, it is one of the longest quartz outcrops of its kind in the world, measuring about 14 km long above ground and up to 50 m wide at certain sections. This Ridge can be classified as a geotope, having outstanding geological value. The Ridge is estimated to be 170 million years old. It is located just outside the north- eastern part of Kuala Lumpur, stretching from Taman Seri Gombak to Kampung Kemensah. The Klang Gates Dam was built at a small natural opening (gap) separating the two main stretches of the Ridge, namely Bukit Batu Tabor in the west and Bukit Chondong in the east. Pressures on the Park The current alignment of the KL Outer Ring Road (KLORR) will have a tremendous impact on the Park, as the alignment of the highway is proposed to cut through to sections of the Park - the Klang Gates Quartz Ridge and the Ampang Forest Reserve. Some residents, community groups and NGOs have spoken out for the need to find a better solution to the KLORR. See also * Geography of Malaysia References * John, Elizabeth.

The 12-song set is described as \\"a rollercoaster ride of crunching guitars\\", pounding rhythms and funked out hip hop beats and rhymes. \\"This is essentially a guitar driven album that's made for the mosh pit. Simply put, it rocks harder!\\" says skinman Rudy about the new material. Malaysian fans would expect something different as Guitarist/Producer JD hinted, \\"We had to think strategically this time around and only release tracks that cater for a specific market so the Japanese/Asian and Malaysian editions will be different.\\" The Japanese edition of the album will be released throughout Asia as an import edition so fans will still be able to obtain both copies. Pop Shuvit walked away with the \\"Best Live Act\\" at the Malaysian English Top Ten Awards 2006. Freakshow Vol 1 : Tales of The Travelling Tunes Pop Shuvit recently released their fourth Studio Album, Freakshow Vol. 1: Tales of the Travelling Tunes with the first single of the album being, Freakshow which featured Dandee from Silksounds. . Marabahaya was from this album which is the 1st single from the Impak Maksima soundtrack. Marabahaya has received very high rotation on both hitz.fm & Fly FM and it is one of the crowds favourite. My Chemical Romance Asian Tour Pop Shuvit was the official opening act for My Chemical Romance on their Asian tour. Gerard Way was impressed after Pop Shuvit opened for them in Kuala Lumpur so MCR offered Pop Shuvit the opportunity to be their opening act for their five remaining shows. However Pop Shuvit had other commitments so they only accepted two. Project E.A.R. Pop Shuvit, together with Ahli Fiqir (Singapore), Saint Loco (Indonesia), Slapshock (Philippines), Silksounds and Thaitanium (Thailand), formed a supergroup called Project E.A.R. (East Asian Revolution), which made their debut in the 2008 MTV Asia Awards in Malaysia. MTV World Stage Live 2011 At the MTV World Stage Live in Malaysia 2011 that took place at I-City, Shah Alam, Pop Shuvit shared the stage with Kpop sensation, Beast, alternative rock band Neon Trees, and multiple MTV award- winning Thirty Seconds to Mars. Pop Shuvit kick-off the show with \\"Old Skool Rocka\\". Performing \\"Oh! Sizuka\\" as the second song and followed by \\"Running Away,\\" a new song from the new album Cherry Blossom Love Affair. Malaysian legend Man Bai then joined Pop Shuvit on stage for the first-ever live performance of \\"Seperti Syurgamu\\", another new song from the new album. Next, Project E.A.R. (East Asian Revolution) also came on the stage for \\"Mantera/Marabahaya\\" and the band wrapped up with lead singer Moots stage diving into the mosh pit.

The granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor is present on precursor cells in the bone marrow, and, in response to stimulation by G-CSF, initiates cell proliferation and differentiation into mature neutrophilic granulocytes and macrophages. The G-CSF-R is a transmembrane receptor that consists of an extracellular ligand- binding portion, a transmembrane domain, and the cytoplasmic portion that is responsible for signal transduction. GCSF-R ligand-binding is associated with dimerization of the receptor and signal transduction through proteins including Jak, Lyn, STAT, and Erk1/2.  Isoforms  The class IV isoform defective for both internalization and differentiation signaling.  Clinical significance  Mutations in this gene are a cause of Kostmann syndrome, also known as severe congenital neutropenia. Mutations in the intracellular part of this receptor are also associated with certain types of leukemia. In clinical medicine, there is a suggestion that use of GCSF should be avoided, at least in children and adolescents and perhaps adults, when G-CSFR isoform IV is overexpressed.

There is no single classification system that can describe all the many variations of nerve injury. In 1941, Seddon introduced a classification of nerve injuries based on three main types of nerve fiber injury and whether there is continuity of the nerve. Usually, however, (peripheral) nerve injury is classified in five stages, based on the extent of damage to both the nerve and the surrounding connective tissue, since supporting glial cells may be involved. Unlike in the central nervous system, neuroregeneration in the peripheral nervous system is possible. The processes that occur in peripheral regeneration can be divided into the following major events: Wallerian degeneration, axon regeneration/growth, and nerve reinnervation. The events that occur in peripheral regeneration occur with respect to the axis of the nerve injury. The proximal stump refers to the end of the injured neuron that is still attached to the neuron cell body; it is the part that regenerates. The distal stump refers to the end of the injured neuron that is still attached to the end of the axon; it is the part of the neuron that will degenerate but that remains in the area toward which the regenerating axon grows. The study of peripheral nerve injury began during the American Civil War and has greatly expanded to the point of using growth- promoting molecules. Types=Neurapraxia Nerve compression in neurapraxia 300px Neurapraxia is the least severe form of nerve injury, with complete recovery. In this case, the axon remains intact, but there is myelin damage causing an interruption in conduction of the impulse down the nerve fiber. Most commonly, this involves compression of the nerve or disruption to the blood supply (ischemia). There is a temporary loss of function which is reversible within hours to months of the injury (the average is 6–8 weeks). Wallerian degeneration does not occur, so recovery does not involve actual regeneration. There is frequently greater involvement of motor than sensory function with autonomic function being retained. In electrodiagnostic testing with nerve conduction studies, there is a normal compound motor action potential amplitude distal to the lesion at day 10, and this indicates a diagnosis of mild neurapraxia instead of axonotmesis or neurotmesis. Axonotmesis This is a more severe nerve injury with disruption of the neuronal axon, but with maintenance of the epineurium. This type of nerve damage may cause paralysis of the motor, sensory, and autonomic. Mainly seen in crush injury. If the force creating the nerve damage is removed in a timely fashion, the axon may regenerate, leading to recovery. Electrically, the nerve shows rapid and complete degeneration, with loss of voluntary motor units. Regeneration of the motor end plates will occur, as long as the endoneural tubules are intact. Axonotmesis involves the interruption of the axon and its covering of myelin but preservation of the connective tissue framework of the nerve (the encapsulating tissue, the epineurium and perineurium, are preserved). Because axonal continuity is lost, Wallerian degeneration occurs. Electromyography (EMG) performed 2 to 4 weeks later shows fibrillations and denervation potentials in musculature distal to the injury site. Loss in both motor and sensory spines is more complete with axonotmesis than with neurapraxia, and recovery occurs only through regenerations of the axons, a process requiring time. Axonotmesis is usually the result of a more severe crush or contusion than neurapraxia, but can also occur when the nerve is stretched (without damage to the epineurium). There is usually an element of retrograde proximal degeneration of the axon, and for regeneration to occur, this loss must first be overcome. The regeneration fibers must cross the injury site and regeneration through the proximal or retrograde area of degeneration may require several weeks. Then the neuritis tip progresses down the distal site, such as the wrist or hand. Proximal lesion may grow distally as fast as 2 to 3 mm per day and distal lesion as slowly as 1.5 mm per day. Regeneration occurs over weeks to years. Neurotmesis Neurotmesis is the most severe lesion with no potential of full recovery. It occurs on severe contusion, stretch, or laceration. The axon and encapsulating connective tissue lose their continuity. The last (extreme) degree of neurotmesis is transsection, but most neurotmetic injuries do not produce gross loss of continuity of the nerve but rather internal disruption of the architecture of the nerve sufficient to involve perineurium and endoneurium as well as axons and their covering. Denervation changes recorded by EMG are the same as those seen with axonotmetic injury. There is a complete loss of motor, sensory and autonomic function. If the nerve has been completely divided, axonal regeneration causes a neuroma to form in the proximal stump. For neurotmesis, it is better to use a new more complete classification called the Sunderland System. Overview of events in peripheral regeneration Wallerian degeneration is a process that occurs before nerve regeneration and can be described as a cleaning or clearing process that essentially prepares the distal stump for reinnervation. Schwann cells are glial cells in the peripheral nervous system that support neurons by forming myelin that encases nerves. During Wallerian degeneration Schwann cells and macrophages interact to remove debris, specifically myelin and the damaged axon, from the distal injury site. (medscape) Calcium has a role in the degeneration of the damage axon. Bands of Büngner are formed when un-innervated Schwann cells proliferate and the remaining connective tissue basement membrane forms endoneurial tubes. Bands of Büngner are important for guiding the regrowing axon. At the neuronal cell body, a process called chromatolysis occurs in which the nucleus migrates to the periphery of the cell body and the endoplasmic reticulum breaks up and disperses. Nerve damage causes the metabolic function of the cell to change from that of producing molecules for synaptic transmission to that of producing molecules for growth and repair. These factors include GAP-43, tubulin and actin. Chromatolysis is reversed when the cell is prepared for axon regeneration. Axon regeneration is characterized by the formation of a growth cone. The growth cone has the ability to produce a protease that digests any material or debris that remains in its path of regeneration toward the distal site. The growth cone responds to molecules produced by Schwann cells such as laminin and fibronectin.  Neuron-intrinsic changes  Immediately following injury, neurons undergo a large number of transcriptional and proteomic changes which switch the cell from a mature, synaptically active neuron to a synaptically silent, growth state. This process is dependent on new transcription, as blocking the ability of cells to transcribe new mRNA severely impairs regeneration. A number of signaling pathways have been shown to be turned on by axon injury and help to enable long distance regeneration including BMP, TGFβ, and MAPKs. Similarly, a growing number of transcription factors also boost the regenerative capacity of peripheral neurons including ASCL1, ATF3, CREB1, HIF1α, JUN, KLF6, KLF7, MYC, SMAD1, SMAD2, SMAD3, SOX11, SRF, STAT3, TP53, and XBP1. Several of these can also boost the regenerative capacity of CNS neurons, making them potential therapeutic targets for treating spinal cord injury and stroke. Role of Schwann cells Guillain–Barré syndrome – nerve damage Schwann cells are active in Wallerian degeneration. They not only have a role in phagocytosis of myelin, but they also have a role in recruitment of macrophages to continue the phagocytosis of myelin. The phagocytic role of Schwann cells has been investigated by studying the expression of molecules in Schwann cells that are typically specific to inflammatory macrophages. Expression of one such molecule MAC-2, a galactose-specific lectin, is observed in not only degenerating nerves that are macrophage-rich but also degenerating nerves that are macrophage-scarce and Schwann cell-rich. Furthermore, the effects of MAC-2 in degenerating nerves are associated with myelin phagocytosis. There was a positive correlation between the amount of MAC-2 expression and the extent of myelin phagocytosis. A deficiency in MAC-2 expression can even cause inhibition of myelin removal from injury sites. Schwann cells are active in demyelination of injured nerves before macrophages are even present at the site of nerve injury. Electron microscopy and immunohistochemical staining analysis of teased nerve fibers shows that before macrophages arrive at the injury site, myelin is fragmented and myelin debris and lipid droplets are found in the cytoplasm of Schwann cells, indicating phagocytic activity before macrophages arrive. Schwann cell activity includes recruitment of macrophages to the injury site. Monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1) plays a role in recruiting monocytes/macrophages. In tellurium-induced demylenation with no axon degeneration, nerve crush with axon degeneration, and nerve transection with axon degeneration an increase in MCP-1 mRNA expression followed by an increase in macrophage recruitment occurred. In addition varying levels of MCP-1 mRNA expression also had an effect. Increased MCP-1 mRNA levels correlated positively with an increase in macrophage recruitment. Furthermore, in situ hybridation determined that the cellular source of MCP-1 was Schwann cells. Schwann cells play an important role in not only producing neurotrophic factors such as nerve growth factor (NGF) and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), which promote growth, of both the damaged nerve and supporting Schwann cells, but also producing neurite promoting factors, which guide the growing axon, both of which are discussed below. Role of macrophages The primary role of macrophages in peripheral regeneration is demylenation during Wallerian degeneration. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that in tellurium demylenated, crushed, and cut nerves, expression of lysozyme, which is a marker for myelin phagocytosis, and of ED1, which is a marker for macrophages, occurred in the same region. Lysozyme was also investigated with respect to the temporal progression of myelin phagocytosis by macrophages in nerve injury. Northern blotting showed that peak lysozyme mRNA expression occurred at an appropriate time with respect to temporal models of myelin phagocytosis. Macrophages do not phagocytose all cellular debris at the nerve injury site; they are selective and will salvage certain factors. Macrophages produce apolipoprotein E which is involved in rescuing cholesterol in damaged nerves. In the same investigation, temporal levels of apolipoprotein E mRNA expression in the three models for demylenation and nerve damage were consistent with respect to models for cholesterol salvage in nerve injury. Macrophages play a role in salvaging cholesterol during nerve injury. Macrophages also play a role in inducing the proliferation of Schwann cells that occurs during Wallerian degeneration. Supernatant has been collected from medium in which macrophages are active in myelin phagocytosis where lysosomal processing of the myelin occurs within the macrophage. The supernatant contains a mitogenic factor, a mitosis promoting factor, that is characterized heat and trypsin sensitivity, both of which characterize it as a peptide. Treatment of Schwann cells with the collected supernatant shows that it is a mitogenic factor and thus plays an important role in the proliferation of Schwann cells. Macrophages are also involved in the secretion factors that promote nerve regeneration. Macrophages secrete not only interleukin-1, a cytokine that induces expression of nerve growth factor (NGF) in Schwann cells but also an interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra). Expression of IL-1ra in mice with transected sciatic nerves via implantation of a tube releasing IL-1ra showed the regrowth of fewer myelinated and unmyelinated axons. Macrophage secretion of interleukin-1 is involved in stimulation of nerve regeneration. Role of neurotrophic factors Several signaling pathways are upregulated following a nerve injury. Neurotrophic factors are those that promote survival and growth of neurons. A trophic factor can be described as a factor that is associated with providing nourishment to allow for growth. In general they are protein ligands for tyrosine kinase receptors; binding to the specific receptor yields autophosphorylation and subsequent phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on proteins that participate in further downstream signaling to activate proteins and genes involved in growth and proliferation. Neurotrophic factors act through retrograde transport in neurons, in which they are taken up by the growth cone of the injured neuron and transported back to the cell body. These neurotrophic factors have both autocrine and paracrine effects, as they promote growth of the damaged neurons as well as the adjacent Schwann cells. Nerve growth factor (NGF) typically has a low level of expression in nerves that are healthy and not growing or developing, but in response to nerve injury NGF expression increases in Schwann cells. This is a mechanism to increase growth and proliferation of Schwann cells at the distal stump in order to prepare for reception of the regenerating axon. NGF has not only a trophic role but also a tropic or guiding role. The Schwann cells that form the bands of Bungner at the distal injury site express NGF receptors as a guiding factor for the regenerating axon of the injured neuron. NGF bound to the receptors on Schwann cells provides the growing neurons that are contacted with a trophic factor to promote further growth and regeneration Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) typically has a high level of expression in Schwann cells associated with nerves that are healthy, but in response to nerve injury CNTF expression decreases in Schwann cells distal to the injury site and remains relatively low unless the injured axon begins to regrow. CNTF has numerous trophic roles in motor neurons in the peripheral nervous system including the prevention of atrophy of dennervated tissue and the prevention of degeneration and death of motor neurons after nerve injury. (frostick) In sciatic motor neurons both CNTF receptor mRNA expression and CNTF receptor is increased after injury for a prolonged time frame compared to the short time frame in the central nervous system suggesting a role for CNTF in nerve regeneration. Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) have been shown to increase the rate of peripheral nervous system axon regeneration. IGF-I and IGF-II mRNA levels are significantly increased distal to the site of crush injury in rat sciatic nerves. At the site of nerve repair, locally delivered IGF-I can significantly increase the rate of axon regeneration within a nerve graft and help expedite functional recovery of a paralyzed muscle. Role of neurite- promoting factors Neurite promoting factors include many extracellular matrix proteins produced by Schwann cells at the distal stump including fibronectin and laminin. Fibronectin are components of the basal lamina and promote neurite growth and adhesion of the growth cone to the basal lamina. In regenerating neural cells, neurite promoting factors play a role in adhesion of the axon and include neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) and N-cadherin. Nerve regeneration therapies Electrical stimulation can promote nerve regeneration. The positive effect of electrical stimulation on nerve regeneration is due to its molecular influence on the damaged neuron and Schwann cells. Electrical stimulation can directly accelerate the expression of cAMP both in neurons and Schwann cells. cAMP is a molecule that stimulates multiple signaling pathways that aid nerve regeneration by enhancing the expression of several neurotrophic factors. Electrical stimulation also results in the influx of calcium ion, which further triggers multiple regeneration pathways. The frequency of stimulation is an important factor in the success of both quality and quantity of axon regeneration as well as growth of the surrounding myelin and blood vessels that support the axon. Histological analysis and measurement of regeneration showed that low frequency stimulation had a more successful outcome than high frequency stimulation on regeneration of damaged sciatic nerves. Other studies have used both oscillating and non-oscillating direct current (DC) stimulation to regenerate mammalian peripheral nerves. Mammalian neurons preferentially orient and grow towards the cathode in DC electric fields. Surgery can be done in case a nerve has become cut or otherwise divided. Recovery of a nerve after surgical repair depends mainly on the age of the patient. Young children can recover close-to-normal nerve function. In contrast, a patient over 60 years old with a cut nerve in the hand would expect to recover only protective sensation, that is, the ability to distinguish hot/cold or sharp/dull. Many other factors also affect nerve recovery. The use of autologous nerve grafting procedures that involve redirection of regenerative donor nerve fibers into the graft conduit has been successful in restoring target muscle function. Localized delivery of soluble neurotrophic factors may help promote the rate of axon regeneration observed within these graft conduits. An expanding area of nerve regeneration research deals with the development of scaffolding and bio-conduits. Scaffolding developed from biomaterial would be useful in nerve regeneration if they successfully exhibit essentially the same role as the endoneurial tubes and Schwann cell do in guiding regrowing axons.  Prevention of intraneural injections  Methods to help prevent peripheral nerve injury include injection pressure monitoring. The presence of a high opening injection pressure (> 20 PSI) is a sensitive sign of intrafascicular/intraneural needle tip placement. Extrafascicular needle tip placement is associated with low pressures (< 20 PSI). Also, high pressure injection was associated with neurologic deficits and severe axonal damage after the block. Other methods of preventing peripheral nerve injury include electrical nerve stimulation and ultrasonography. Electrical stimulation with a motor response at < 0.2 mA only can occur with an intraneural/intrafasciular needle tip location.Gadsden. Neurologic Complications of Peripheral Nerve Blocks. NYSORA.

Alewife rapid transit station in Massachusetts. Bicycle parking typically requires a degree of security to prevent theft. The context for bike parking requires proper infrastructure and equipment (bike racks, bicycle locks etc.) for secure and convenient storage. Parking facilities include lockers, racks, manned or unmanned bicycle parking stations including automated facilities, covered areas, and legal arrangements for ad hoc parking alongside railings and other street furniture.  Overview  Hap- hazard bike parking gone wild. Without organized parking facilities, bike parking can easily become a problem in densely populated areas. The space needed to park a single automobile can accommodate nearly a dozen bicycles. Bicycle parking is an important part of a municipality's cycling infrastructure and as such is studied in the discipline of bicycle transportation engineering. When bicycle parking facilities are scarce or inadequate, nearby trees or parking meters are often used instead. Sections of existing car parks can often be retrofitted as cycle parking, offering advantages of location, cover, security, and parking for more people. In addition to car parking, town planning policies and regulations increasingly require provisions for bicycle parking in new developments. Many mass transit stations include bicycle parking in the form of bike racks or purpose-built bicycle parking stations to facilitate mixed-mode commuting. Secure bicycle parking is arguably a key factor that influences the decision to cycle.Lesson 17: Bicycle Parking and Storage , Federal Highway Administration University Course on Bicycle and Pedestrian Transportation Publication No. FHWA- HRT-05-133 July 2006 To be considered secure, parking facilities must be of a suitable design; allowing the bicycle to be locked via the frame (see bicycle parking rack). A readily observable location can also permit so-called passive security from passers-by. Weather protection is also desirable. As a rule, where cycling is encouraged as an alternative to motoring, efforts should be made to make bicycle parking more convenient and attractive to use than nearby car parking arrangements. This usually means providing a wide distribution of visible, clearly designated parking spots, close to the entrances of destinations being served. Storage rooms or bicycle lockers may also be provided. In some cases, large concentrations of bike parking may be more appropriate, sometimes being supervised and sometimes fee-based. Examples include bicycle parking stations at public transport interchanges such as railway, subway, tram, bus stations or ferry ports where they may be useful in mixed-mode commuting.Bicycle Access to Public Transportation: Learning from Abroad by Michael Replogle, Journal of the Institute for Transportation Engineers, December 1992 Conversely, where cycling is seen as an unwelcome or inappropriate activity, or there is a lack of knowledge about best practices, bicycle parking may simply not be provided or else placed at awkward, distant, and out-of-sight locations.Report: Ashcroft High School, Crawley Green Road. Discharge condition 3 (school travel plan), Report by: Development Control Manager, Luton Borough Council 14 July 2004 Cyclists may be expressly forbidden from parking their bicycles at the most convenient locations. In April 2007, the authorities at the University of California's Santa Barbara campus started confiscating bicycles parked at other than official bike racks.To Proceed With Impoundment of Bikes, by Benjamin Gottlieb Daily Nexus, University of California - Santa Barbara News, 20 April 2007 (Accessed 28 October 2007) Some property owners or municipal authorities display signage on fencing to discourage bicyclists from locking their bicycles.

Early life Carson was born in Montgomery, Fayette County on April 30, 1910. He was the son of Lawrence W. and Alice Montgomery Carson. He received a law degree from Washington and Lee University. Career Carson was named as Assistant Prosecuting Attorney for Fayette County, West Virginia in 1944. At roughly the same time, Carson became the chairman of the Fayette County Democratic Executive Committee. He resigned this position in 1948 to unsuccessfully run for the state's 11th Senate district, being defeated in the Democratic primary by J. Alfred Taylor, Jr.. In 1952, Carson won the race for Prosecuting Attorney for Fayette County, succeeding his former boss C.B. Vickers. Carson was elected to the West Virginia Senate in 1956. He was nominated again in 1960. As no one filed to stand in the Republican primary, the party executive committee chose John Gwinn to oppose Carson's reelection. However, Gwinn's certification was lost in the mail, and he was disqualified from the ballot. A write-in campaign for Gwinn only earned 5.2% of the vote, and Carson was re- elected. Incumbent Senate President Ralph J. Bean did not seek reelection in 1960, leaving his position open for a replacement. Candidates included Carson and the moderate Julius W. Singleton Jr. of Morgantown. With the support of incoming Governor W. W. Barron and organized labor groups, Carson earned so much support among Senate Democrats that Singleton was not able to place his name for nomination. He would win his seat again in 1964, with no Republican opposition on the ballot. Instead of running for a fourth term in the Senate, Carson opted to run for Attorney General. He was defeated in the Democratic primary by Chauncey H. Browning Jr. After losing, Carson practiced law privately in Fayette County. He was named the Clerk of the Senate for the 1972, 1973, and 1974 terms. He declined to seek the nomination for the 1975 session, citing health reasons.

He was a graduate of Bishop Donahue Memorial High School in McMechen and received a B.A. degree from West Liberty State College and a M.P.A. degree from the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs, Syracuse University. Tonkovich then served in the United States Army Infantry in Vietnam. Career Tonkovich was elected to the West Virginia House of Delegates in 1972 and 1974 and was then elected to the West Virginia Senate from the 2nd Senatorial District in 1979, the first senator from Marshall County elected to the office and was named one of the \\"Outstanding Young Men of America\\" in 1974, 1976 and 1977. Tonkovich was appointed Senate Majority Whip in 1981 and Senate Majority Leader in 1983. In 1984 he was elected again. While in the legislature, he served on many committees including Education, Health and Welfare committees and the Interim Committee on Penal Reform. He was also involved in the passage of the State Open Meetings Law and the Freedom of Information Act. He was also a member of the Democratic National Committee as well as the Congressional Senatorial Committee. Arrest and Conviction In September 1989, Tonkovich pled guilty to extorting $5,000 from a group that sought his support of casino gambling legislation in 1986. The proceeding was delayed when the judge said he was not sure that Tonkovich was guilty and gave him time to reconsider. Tonkovich still maintained he was guilty of extortion. Tonkovich's guilty plea to one count of a six-count indictment came after a federal jury heard five days of testimony during his extortion and racketeering trial. U.S. Attorney Michael Carey said prosecutors planned to dismiss the remaining charges.https://www.upi.com/Archives/1989/09/14/Tonkovich-pleads-guilty-to- extortion/1312621748800/ 'Your honor, I'd like to change my plea from not guilty to guilty,' Tonkovich told U.S. District Judge John Copenhaver. Throughout the trial, the defense had maintained that Tonkovich, 43, believed WVCC paid him the money for marketing work he was hired to perform. Copenhaver recessed the proceedings for 10 minutes to allow Tonkovich to confer with his lawyer, James Lees. Following the recess, Tonkovich said he believed WVCC paid him the money to gain influence over him and that he was guilty of extortion. Copenhaver delayed accepting Tonkovich's plea for several minutes Thursday, saying he was not convinced the former lawmaker was guilty of the extortion charge. Tonkovich signed a plea agreement with federal prosecutors in which he admitted extorting $5,000 from WVVC Inc. in February 1986. The judge also ordered Tonkovich to pay $4,800 in jury costs associated with the five-day trial within 30 days.https://www.upi.com/Archives/1989/09/14/Tonkovich-pleads- guilty-to-extortion/1312621748800/ In December 1989, Tonkovich was sentenced to five years in prison and fined $10,000 in federal court for extorting $5,000 from gambling interests.

Outside prisons, the organization collaborates with churches, para-church organizations, and local service providers to support families with loved ones behind bars and people affected by crime. Prison Fellowship staff and volunteers also help to prepare men and women to leave prison with a positive outlook—ready to succeed. In several prison facilities, mentorships are offered, life-skills training, marriage and parenting classes, and other programs that teach personal responsibility, the value of education and hard work, and care for people and their property, so that prisoners are prepared to thrive in their communities after release.https://www.prisonfellowship.org/ Tonkovich died at age 55; his body was discovered on February 10, 2002 at his Benwood area home by his son.

Burdette holds many state and national awards and records as he served at such young ages in various roles such as a former Democratic President of the West Virginia Senate from Wood County serving from 1989 to 1995. After serving as chief of staff for Governor Wise, Burdette ran The Burdette Group, a West Virginia- based government relations and lobbying company, until his appointment as secretary. Keith Burdette's political education began early. He was a volunteer for Jay Rockefeller’s campaign for governor in 1972 at the age of 16 and by 1976 was running for public office in his own right. Elected to the first of two terms in the West Virginia House of Delegates in 1978, he entered the House as one of its youngest members in history. In 1982, he was elected to the state senate at the age of 27 and quickly began a climb through the ranks. He served as a member of both the Senate Finance and Judiciary Committees during his first term and became the vice chairman and later the chairman of the Education Committee. During his second of three terms in the Senate, Burdette became Majority Leader and then in September 1989, was elected the 42nd president of the state senate and first in the line of gubernatorial succession at the historic age of only 34. Keith Burdette led efforts to reform the state's ethics laws; overhaul education funding and the Public Insurance Program. Working with Governor Caperton, he led the Senate through a series of financial reforms that rescued the state from near bankruptcy. In 1992, the United States Junior Chamber of Commerce recognized his leadership by naming him one of the Ten Outstanding Young Americans for the year. Days after the 2000 election, Governor-elect Bob Wise asked Keith Burdette to join his administration. He was a key player during the transition, assisting with the interviews and selection of countless members of the new administration. His official title as a member of the Governor's senior staff was senior assistant for policy and legislative relations, but he became the go-to guy for an endless list of administrative goals. Burdette directed a legislative agenda that saw major reforms to the medical liability; workers compensation; and coal hauling laws. He orchestrated Governor Wise's bold reforms to the state's video lottery laws which were both groundbreaking and financially lucrative for the state. The law ultimately allowed the funding of the PROMISE scholarship program in West Virginia. He was the administrative point man for the development of the state budget, assisting in the production of three balanced budgets without a major tax increase in spite of a significant national economic downturn. He also played a key role in the selection of appointments to a broad array of government posts including the Public Service Commission, the State Board of Education and a variety of other boards and commissions.

She has been portrayed by Kelley Menighan Hensley since July 1992. Ten years later, the actress received her first Daytime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress. The character briefly appeared on the CBS soap, The Young and the Restless, in March 2007, asking Amber Moore about information on her sister and biological daughter, Alison Stewart. Storylines Emily Stewart is the daughter of Dan and Susan Stewart. They divorced soon after she was born. She goes to live with her father, but after a custody battle between Dan and Susan, in which Dan won, she goes back and forth between them. Emily's life wasn't very stable; her mother was an alcoholic, and when she was 8 years old, her father died. Susan and Emily later left town, but Emily came back to Oakdale when she was 17. A very young Emily found herself falling in love with James Stenbeck, and she became pregnant. She had already decided she wanted nothing more to do with James. Therefore, she had a brief relationship with Holden Snyder, and she led him to believe that the baby was his, leading to him marrying her. They divorced soon after she miscarried her baby and Holden learned the truth. Later, Emily met Brock Lombard, who was a mobster. At this time, Emily offered a summer job to a young Paul Stenbeck, who was the son of Barbara Ryan. One night, after she and Brock had a big argument, Paul stopped by her house. She was upset about the argument, and without thinking, she and Paul made love. Paul was a virgin. He developed deep feelings for Emily, and when his father, James Stenbeck, found out about the situation, he was furious with Emily. Paul came by and heard the argument between his father and Emily. Trying to protect Emily, he grabbed a gun and shot his father. Soon after, Brock reformed from being a mobster. Emily told Brock about the incident with Paul and his father. Brock forgave Emily and planned to be with her forever when someone from the mob shot him. Brock was found dead. Emily's mother, Susan, wanted to have a baby but was unable to conceive. Emily offered to donate her eggs so Susan could undergo artificial insemination. The procedure was successful and Susan gave birth to a daughter, Alison, but it took a while for Emily to be comfortable with the idea that Alison was her sister, not her daughter. Emily met Diego Santana, but the affair was disastrous. She stumbled upon some information that led her to believe that he was a mobster making some bad deals. When Diego found out that she knew, he raped her. Devastated, Emily learned to move on. Sometime later, Diego was shot by Kirk Anderson on the day Diego was to marry Lily. Emily had several relationships that just didn't work out. She tried too hard to make it work, but in the end, she was left behind. Emily fell in love with Tom Hughes, who was married to Margo. Emily felt she could be a better wife and tried to break up his marriage to Margo. She was determined to destroy his marriage and believed that she could get Tom to love her. She later realized it could never be and decided to get on with her life, when she finally realized Tom didn't love her. She became pregnant with Tom's baby and gave birth to a son, Daniel Hughes. Although this affair put tension on Tom and Margo's marriage, they soon patched things up. Emily met Hal Munson. Hal's wife, Barbara, just left him for another man. His world was turned upside down. While dating, Emily went missing. After a long search, it was discovered that Emily, Carly Tenney, and Rose D'Angelo were all kidnapped and taken to another country where they were injected with a serum that would quickly speed up the aging process. Once rescued, the girls looked three times their age. Luckily, Hal and the police department found the man in charge and were able to convince him to give the girls a reverse serum. It worked, and their beautiful faces returned. Hal and Emily's relationship led to marriage. They were happy for a couple of years, but Hal was at the police station most of the time and Emily became lonely, which led to attractions to others, and finally, their marriage ended. Paul Ryan and Emily became involved in an intimate relationship. At one point, they were both locked up in jail for their involvement in switching Jennifer Munson's baby with Gwen Norbeck's. They decided to get married, and when Emily went to meet Paul to get married, he told her that he had changed his mind and she didn't need to be with someone like him. As he turned to walk away, Emily shot him. Thinking that she had killed him, she tried to get rid of the body. When Paul came back to Oakdale, he won Emily over by telling her that he forgave her. At this time, Emily kidnapped Dusty Donovan, and in order to find him, Paul decided to marry Emily hoping it would help him find out where Dusty was. Finally, Dusty was found and Emily had a breakdown and jumped off a cliff. Emily survived cause Paul saved get life, while in the hospital it was discovered she was pregnant with Paul's child. Instead of being sent to prison she was sent to an institution for help, she and Paul got a divorce. Before her due date, Emily got caught in a bad storm at the Snyder farm with Meg, who was seeing Paul at the time. She went into labor and there was no way to stop the baby from being born. Meg helped her deliver a little girl. Her daughter died shortly after being born; Paul and Emily named her Jennifer. During these dark times, Emily became a call girl for Cheri Love, believing she was worthless. Dusty Donovan found out about it and made her see the truth. She left prostitution. Around this time, she realized that Alison was in deep trouble. She was addicted to meth and was doing porn in Las Vegas. Emily and Dusty worked together to save Alison. They managed to get her back to Oakdale, off drugs and away from the porn career. Emily began to have serious feelings for Dusty but it took him a while to get past her past as a prostitute. When he finally did, Emily learned that he and Alison had had sympathy sex in Las Vegas. She was crushed and left town. Emily returned to Oakdale months later with Chris Hughes. They had a steamy relationship, but she wasn't in love with Chris, as she was only trying to get back at Dusty. Dusty and Chris butted heads from the moment he returns and on New Year's Eve, Emily couldn't deny her true feelings and had sex with Dusty in his car. She said it couldn't happen again and tried to keep the secret from Chris. Lily, who was having an affair with Dusty at the time, learned of Emily's prostitution soon after Dusty's death and outed Emily in an anonymous note left for Chris. He couldn't believe she had lied to him and ended their relationship. Emily tried to make things right with Chris but he wouldn't even talk to her. Because of the situation, Emily became a suspect in Dusty's shooting and subsequent death. It was later learned that Colonel Mayer shot him and that Evan Walsh IV had killed him with an injection to keep him from telling the truth about a research project at the hospital. Soon after this, Casey Hughes returned to town. He fell for Emily almost immediately but she tried to keep her distance from him. They wound up making love on a business trip to New York and from then on couldn't keep their hands off one another. Emily tried to end the relationship several times but couldn't. Margo found out about their relationship when she returned early from a weekend away. She threatened to kill Emily but Casey stepped between them. Margo, who found out about the prostitution too, outed Emily to Tom and Casey. Casey already knew and didn't care but Tom was flabbergasted. He threatened to take full custody of Daniel. Casey managed to get through to him and he dropped the case at the last second. Emily began to act strangely after a bottle of perfume was delivered to her office, but Casey didn't catch on.

She said she wanted an annulment but then retracted the statement when she was dosed with more perfume. She and Casey became deathly ill because of the perfume but Chris' antidote saved their lives. Their families finally began to accept Emily and Casey's relationship but Casey wanted more than Emily was ready to give. He was determined to have kids so she decided to have her tubes tied.

A Bochdalek hernia is a congenital abnormality in which an opening exists in the infant's diaphragm, allowing normally intra-abdominal organs (particularly the stomach and intestines) to enter into the thoracic cavity. In the majority of people, the affected lung will be deformed,Diaphragmatic Hernia. 2007. Children's Hospital of Wisconsin, Wisconsin. 3 Feb. 2007 and the resulting lung compression can be life- threatening. Bochdalek hernias occur more commonly on the posterior left side (85%, versus right side 15%). Bochdalek hernia are rare. This type of hernia was first described in 1754 by McCauley and subsequently studied and named after the Czech pathologist, Vincenz Alexander Bochdalek (1801–1883). Signs and symptoms=Children In normal Bochdalek hernia cases, the symptoms are often observable simultaneously with the baby's birth. A few of the symptoms of a Bochdalek Hernia include difficulty breathing, fast respiration and increased heart rate. Also, if the baby appears to have cyanosis (blue- tinted skin) this can also be a sign. Another way identify a baby with Bochdalek hernia, is to look at the chest immediately after birth. If the baby has a Bochdalek hernia it may appear that one side of the chest cavity is larger than the other and or the abdomen seems to be caved in. Adults Symptoms rarely develop in adults. If symptoms, do occur they may be vague and related to the gastrointestinal tract. This may include pain or signs of a bowel obstruction. Causes Most likely, Bochdalek hernias are formed throughout the growth process and organ construction during fetal development. During fetal development, the diaphragm is formed between the seventh and tenth week. Also, during this time, the esophagus, stomach, and intestines are formed. Therefore, a Bochdalek hernia forms either from malformation of the diaphragm, or the intestines become locked into the chest cavity during the construction of the diaphragm. Although these are some factors that contribute to a Bochdalek hernia, it does not take all variables into account. Bochdalek hernias, along with Morgagni hernias, are both multifactor conditions, meaning that there are many reasons and multiple variables that contribute to the malformations. For example, in each case there could be genetic and or environmental condition(s) that can add to the probability of this birth defect. Diagnosis One way to determine if a baby does in fact have a Bochdalek hernia, would be to have a pediatrician perform a physical on the infant. A chest x-ray can also be done to examine the abnormalities of not only the lungs but also the diaphragm and the intestine. In addition to these, a doctor can also take a blood test, drawing arterial blood to check and determine how well the baby is breathing and his or her ability to breathe. A chromosomal test (done by testing the blood) can also be performed to determine whether or not the problem was genetic. The doctors can also take an ultrasound of the heart (echocardiogram) to evaluate the health of the heart. Treatment=Children There are different pathways for treatment available. The first step in treatment includes the baby's admission into the NICU (Neonatal Intensive Care Unit). The preferred path of treatment for most Bochdalek Hernia is that babies who are admitted in the NICU, are placed on a mechanical ventilator to help breathing. Very rarely will the hernia be small enough that it is not noticed. It is more likely to be asymptomatic if it is on the right side of the chest. If the infant cannot be stabilized using medical treatments and mechanical ventilation, the alternate pathway involves putting the infants on a temporary heart/lung bypass machine, called ECMO, which stands for extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation. ECMO allows oxygen to be regulated into the blood and then pumps the blood throughout the entire body. Normally, this machine is used to stabilize the baby's condition. It is preferred to stabilize the infant prior to surgery, to minimize complications, if possible. The only treatment is surgery.Larrazábal, Natasha. Diaphragmatic Hernia, Left. 2003. Caracas-Venezuela. Diaphragmatic hernia. 6 Feb. 2007 . After the baby is stable and his or her state has improved, the diaphragm can be fixed and the misplaced organs can be relocated to their correct position. That is either done via primary repair where the remaining diaphragm is stretched to cover the hole, or an abdominal muscle is split so it can be used to stretch over the hole, and the last option is with a Gor-Tex patch, which has higher risks of later infection or re-herniation. Although these are various treatments for Bochdalek Hernias, it does not guarantee the baby will survive. Since the baby must go through some or all of the previous treatments, the baby's hospital stay is usually longer than that of a \\"normal\\" newborn. The average infants born with a Bochdalek Hernia stay in the hospital between 23.1 and 26.8 days. An infant needing to go on ECMO will have a longer stay and likely worse outcome than one who was stabilized without ECMO. Adults If the disorder is diagnosed in an adult and they remain without symptoms no specific treatment is required. In those who are symptomatic surgery may be carried out by an open or closed approach. Prognosis Bochdalek hernia can be a life-threatening condition. Approximately 85.3% of newborns born with a Bochdalek hernia are immediately high risk.Klein, Jaquier M. \\"Hospital Stays, Hospital Charges, and in-Hospital Deaths Among Infants with Selected Birth Defects --- United States, 2003.\\" CDC. 19 Jan. 2007. 3 Feb. 2007 . Infants born with a Bochdalek hernia have a \\"high mortality rate due to respiratory insufficiency\\".\\"Hernia.\\" Encarta. 2006. Microsoft Corporation. 8 Feb. 2007 <>. 2009-10-31. Between 25–60% of infants with a Bochdalek hernia die.Hekmatnia, Ali, and Kieran McHugh. \\"Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia.\\" EMedicine (2003). 8 Feb. 2007 . The lungs, diaphragm, and digestive system are all forming at the same time, so when a Bochdalek hernia permits the abdominal organs to invade the chest cavity rather than remain under the diaphragm in the correct position, it puts the infant in critical condition. These \\"foreign bodies\\" in the chest cavity compress the lungs, impairing their proper development and causing pulmonary hypoplasia.\\"Diaphragmatic Hernia.\\" HealthSystems. 24 Nov. 2006. UVA Health. 3 Feb. 2007. . Since the lungs of infants suffering from a Bochdalek hernia have fewer alveoli than normal lungs, Bochdalek hernias are life-threatening conditions due to respiratory distress. Like the lungs, the intestines may also have trouble developing correctly. If the intestines are trapped within the thoracic cavity, then the lungs and intestines may not be receiving the amount of blood they need to stay healthy and function properly. More individualized prognosis for infants depends on several factors, including where the infant is born, the amount of herniation into the thoracic cavity, whether the liver is in the thorax as well, and other malformations including heart defects.

Some families temporarily relocate to be at the CDH surgical center of choice. Epidemiology Bochdalek hernias make up about 0.17% to 6% of all diaphragmatic hernia cases when they appear spontaneously in adults and about one in every 2200 to 12,500 births every year.Jeffrey, Mark E., and Wilbur A. Gorodetsky. \\"Adult Bochdalek Hernia.\\" Medind. 10, Sept. 2004, accessed 3 Feb. 2007 . Babies who are born with a Bochdalek hernia are more than likely to have another birth defect caused by the hernia. About twenty percent of those children born with a Bochdalek hernia, also have a congenital heart defect. In addition, infants born with this condition may also have other abnormalities. \\"Between five and sixteen [percent of infants] have a chromosomal abnormality.\\" In most cases, left-sided hernias or Bochdalek hernias have a ratio of 3:2 of males to females. In other words, Bochdalek hernias are more common in men.

Nature in the Mazandaran region of Iran is distinct and varied sections with a mixture of coastal, plains, prairies, forests, and rainforests. The Mazandarani cuisine of coastal regions is very different from mountainous regions as people settled in the Alborz usually use the indigenous herbs and coastal people use the dishes of fish and Caspian (Mazani) rice with vegetables.  History  The Mazandaran Province is the east of the Gilan Province in Iran, the southern coast of the Caspian Sea is sometime referred to as the \\"fertile Caspian provinces\\". Citrus fruit, specifically orange crops are grown in this region and influence the cuisine. Historically in Iran, rice is a common food only in the Mazandaran and Gilan Provinces, which is prepared in this region in a kateh cooking style, unlike the typical polos/chelo found in other parts of Iran. Rice crops are grown in the sloping regions of the Alborz mountain range, part of which is in the Mazandaran Province. Seafood is a strong component for coastal Mazandarani cuisine and present in many meals. Persian caviar (ḵāvīar) is incorporated in dishes and often served with egg dishes (some of which are similar to a frittata or omelette). Between 1400 until 1870, the Mazandaran Province was the only place cultivating sugarcane, and it was sometimes eaten with bread and rice. Some local, wild herbs used in Mazandarani cuisine include: zolang, anarijeh, ouji, sersem. Outside of the Mazandaran Province, these local herbs are not known to many people. It's thought by some that certain local dishes and herbs could be used as health remedies for an illness and as a result, various scholars come yearly to Mazandaran province to research these wild, indigenous herbs and regional dishes. Stinging nettles are found throughout the province during springtime and a Mazandarani nettle soup is made from them, the nettles are said to have medicinal properties as a blood tonic and to improve hay fever. List of select northern Iranian dishes This is a list of northern Iranian regional dishes, primarily found in the Mazandaran, Gilan and Golestan provinces. Due to the landscape, seasons and native plants, these regions have similar traditional dishes but have a distinct culinary history from the other provinces in Iran. * Aghouze-Messeama * Dewpetti * Ispina-Saek * Khali Aush (Keahi-Esh, soup/stew) * Naz Khatun (Naz-Xatune) * Ispinej-Mearji * Keahi- Heali * Baghali ghatogh (bean stew) – typically made in Iran with a bean called \\"pacheh baghali\\" (Rashti fava beans), but outside of Iran this is made with either lima beans, kidney beans or fava beans.

Early life=Childhood Born in Appleton, Wisconsin to Glennon Bierk, and Doris Ruth Steenson; following his parents divorce Bierk moved with his mother to Lafayette, California.Canadian Art Database Bierk said of his childhood, \\"We were plunked into an upper middle class neighbourhood before divorce was common, and she [my mother] not only provided for me but also was my mother, father, teacher and friend. It was my uncle Spiros, though, who taught me - at an early age - what you might call the work ethic. I always worked, at least from the time I was in grade six or seven. Spiros owned a mayonnaise factory in San Francisco and I started working there, doing things like scraping the labels of returned mayonnaise bottles and scraping the mold from cheese - eight hour days in the summers from the time I was 12 or 13.\\" Early adulthood and education Bierk graduated from high school in 1962 and joined the National Guard. Initially he studied at California College of Arts & Crafts,, Bierk dropped out after a year and half, and as he described it, \\"...I took off, hitchhiked across the country, ended up in Florida, and then caught a boat to the Bahamas....I got a job as librarian at...Mary Star of the Sea School, a Catholic grammar school, where I persuaded Sister Mary Alice to let me teach art as well.\\" Upon his return to California, Bierk was admitted to Humboldt State University where he earned a bachelor of arts 1969, and a master of fine arts in 1970. Bierk's sister-in-law lived in Toronto, Canada, and in 1971 he immigrated there with his young family. Career=Immigration and teaching During the year that he lived in Toronto, Bierk immersed himself in the local cultural scene, which he described, \\"...I familiarized myself with the gallery scene...which struck me as vibrant, pioneering, and exploratory.\\" Bierk migrated to Peterborough, Ontario in 1972 to take up a teaching position at Kenner Collegiate Vocational Institute, and later at Fleming College. Artspace founding Along with poet, Dennis Tourbin, Bierk founded and directed Artspace between 1974 and 1987, which was one of Canada's earliest artist operated art centers. Critical reception and analysis In a June 2001 Art in America review, critic Jonathan Goodman wrote, \\"Bierk quotes from the past not so much to critique current art as to reinterpret a way of seeing that he associates with artists as disparate as Vermeer, Eakins, Ingres, Manet and Fantin-Latour....[Bierk] accomplishes this particularly well when he starkly juxtaposes two or three of his eclectic art-historical references within a single work.\\" Noting the work's \\"virtuoso\\" technical quality, Goodman also observes that Bierk's \\"marvelously romantic\\" landscape paintings are, unlike these referential paintings, invented images, rather than appropriated or copied from masterworks.Jonathan Goodman, Art in America, June 2001 Both Goodman's review and Bierk's 2002 New York Times obituary note that Bierk used framing to call attention, in a way that is pointedly \\"postmodern\\", to the historical disjunction between the evoked masterworks and the contemporary cultural environment: \\"He painted copies of works by artists like Vermeer or the Hudson River School painter Frederic Edwin Church, for example, and framed them within broad steel panels, setting up a tension between humanism and old masterly craft on the one hand, and Modernist abstraction and industrial fabrication on the other.\\" Public collections * Art Gallery of Greater Victoria, Victoria, British Columbia * Art Gallery of Peterborough, Peterborough, Ontario * The Robert McLaughlin Gallery, Oshawa, Ontariohttps://rmg.on.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Press-land-sea-air.pdf * Art Gallery of Windsor, Windsor, Ontario * Boca Raton Museum of Art, Boca Raton, Florida * Canadian Museum of Contemporary Photography, Ottawa, Ontario * The Dayton Art Institute, Dayton, Ohio * Evansville Museum of Arts and Science, Evansville, Indiana * Museum London, London, Ontario * Montgomery Museum of Fine Arts, Montgomery, Alabama * National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario * City of Peterborough, Ontario * Tom Thomson Art Gallery Owen Sound, Ontario Awards * 1991 Best Album Cover of the Year, RAW Magazine * 1980-81 Ontario Association of Art Galleries Poster Design, First Prize * 1980 Ontario Association of Art Galleries Catalogue Design, First Prize * 1979-80 Ontario Association of Art Galleries, Best Overall Gallery Image, First Prize * 1979 Ontario Association of Art Galleries, Newsletter Design, First Prize * Canada Council Artist-in-Residence, North Bay, Ontario * Royal Canadian Academy of Arts Personal life and death=Marriages and children Bierk became Canadian citizen in 1978.

Thereafter he held numerous posts within the civil service: police court in Kandy; police magistrate and commissioner of requests at Kalpitiya, Puttalam, Matara, Avissawella, Pasyala, Matale, Kalutara and Colombo; and district judge in Chilaw, Kegalle, Kalutara, Batticaloa and Kurunegala. Early on his career, Arunachalam's quality of work was noticed by Chief Justice John Budd Phear who recommended him to the Governor and Secretary of State. In 1887 Governor Arthur Hamilton-Gordon appointed Arunachalam acting Registrar-General and Fiscal of the Western Province, by passing 30 officers senior to Arunachalam. Fraud, corruption and inefficiency was endemic in the department and so Arunachalam successfully re-organised the department. He was appointed acting Commissioner of Requests in 1891 and Registrar-General in 1898. Arunachalam was entrusted with managing the 1901 census by being appointed Superintendent of Census in 1900. He started codifying Ceylon's law but only managed to produce the first volume of A Digest of the Civil Law of Ceylon. Arunachalam was an official member of the Legislative Council of Ceylon and a member of the Executive Council of Ceylon between 1912 and 1913. He retired from the civil service in 1913. Arunachalam's became interested in politics during his university days. He agitated for political reform whilst still working in the civil service. In retirement Arunachalam became involved in politics, founding the Ceylon National Association and the Ceylon Reform League, of which he was chairman, in 1917. He was one of the founders of the Ceylon National Congress (CNC) in 1919 and served as its first president from 1919 to 1920. Arunachalam left the CNC in 1921 following disputes about communal representation in the Legislative Council, which Arunachalam opposed, and the connivance of Sinhalese politicians which resulted in no Tamils being elected from Western Province at the 1921 legislative council election. He founded the Ceylon Tamil League in 1923. Arunachalam was knighted in 1914. In 1917 he became the first Ceylonese to be elected president of the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society. He founded the Senthamil Paripalana Sabai and was president of the Ceylon Saiva Paripalana Sabai. He and his wife founded the Sri Arunachaleswarar Temple at Mutwal. Arunachalam co-founded the Ceylon Social Services League in 1915 and served as its president. He was also involved in the fledgling trade union movement in Ceylon and founded Ceylon's first trade union, the Ceylon Workers' Welfare League, in 1919. He served as president of the Ceylon Workers' Federation from 1920 to 1921. Arunachalam led the campaign for a university in Ceylon and was known as the \\"father of the Ceylon University\\", having founded the Ceylon University Association in 1906. He died on 9 January 1924 in Madurai whilst on Hindu pilgrimage in southern India.

Career In 1996 he was chair- person of the advisory council producing the first national report on the state of Australia's environment. He is a patron of Sustainable Population Australia.Sustainable Population Australia - Aims and Objectives One of his principal interests is the way policy decisions influence use of science and technology, especially in the fields of energy and environment. He wrote for 13 years a regular column for New Scientist and also writes for several other publications, as well as contributing frequently to electronic media programs. Lowe was a member of the Australian Radiation Health and Safety Advisory Council from 2002 to 2014 and a former member or chair of many other bodies advising all three levels of government in Australia.

He is currently Emeritus Professor of Science, Technology and Society and former Head of the School of Science at Griffith University. He is also an adjunct professor at Sunshine Coast University and Flinders University.  Energy advocacy  Lowe sees the nuclear power option for electricity generation as being risky and unworkable. He says nuclear power installations peaked last century and in the past 20 years, retirements, cancellations and deferments have outnumbered new reactor construction. Lowe says nuclear power is too expensive, with insurmountable problems associated with waste disposal and weapons proliferation. It is also not a fast enough response to address climate change. Lowe advocates for renewable energy which he claims is \\"quicker, less expensive and less dangerous than nuclear\\". Awards Lowe was made an Officer of the Order of Australia in 2001 for services to science, technology, and the environment. In 2002 he was awarded a Centenary Medal for contributions to environmental science and won the Eureka Prize for promotion of science.

P-P plots are vastly used to evaluate the skewness of a distribution. The Q–Q plot is more widely used, but they are both referred to as \\"the\\" probability plot, and are potentially confused.  Definition  A P–P plot plots two cumulative distribution functions (cdfs) against each other:Nonparametric statistical inference by Jean Dickinson Gibbons, Subhabrata Chakraborti, 4th Edition, CRC Press, 2003, , p. 145 given two probability distributions, with cdfs \\"F\\" and \\"G\\", it plots (F(z),G(z)) as z ranges from -\\\\infty to \\\\infty. As a cdf has range [0,1], the domain of this parametric graph is (-\\\\infty,\\\\infty) and the range is the unit square [0,1]\\\\times [0,1]. Thus for input z the output is the pair of numbers giving what percentage of f and what percentage of g fall at or below z. The comparison line is the 45° line from (0,0) to (1,1) – the distributions are equal if and only if the plot falls on this line – any deviation indicates a difference between the distributions.  Example  As an example, if the two distributions do not overlap, say F is below G, then the P–P plot will move from left to right along the bottom of the square – as z moves through the support of F, the cdf of F goes from 0 to 1, while the cdf of G stays at 0 – and then moves up the right side of the square – the cdf of F is now 1, as all points of F lie below all points of G, and now the cdf of G moves from 0 to 1 as z moves through the support of G. (need a graph for this paragraph)  Use  As the above example illustrates, if two distributions are separated in space, the P–P plot will give very little data – it is only useful for comparing probability distributions that have nearby or equal location. Notably, it will pass through the point (1/2, 1/2) if and only if the two distributions have the same median. P–P plots are sometimes limited to comparisons between two samples, rather than comparison of a sample to a theoretical model distribution.Testing for Normality, by Henry C. Thode, CRC Press, 2002, , Section 2.2.3, Percent–percent plots, p. 23 However, they are of general use, particularly where observations are not all modelled with the same distribution. However, it has found some use in comparing a sample distribution from a known theoretical distribution: given n samples, plotting the continuous theoretical cdf against the empirical cdf would yield a stairstep (a step as z hits a sample), and would hit the top of the square when the last data point was hit. Instead one only plots points, plotting the observed kth observed points (in order: formally the observed kth order statistic) against the k/(n + 1) quantile of the theoretical distribution. This choice of \\"plotting position\\" (choice of quantile of the theoretical distribution) has occasioned less controversy than the choice for Q–Q plots. The resulting goodness of fit of the 45° line gives a measure of the difference between a sample set and the theoretical distribution. A P–P plot can be used as a graphical adjunct to a tests of the fit of probability distributions,Michael J.R. (1983) \\"The stabilized probability plot\\". Biometrika, 70(1), 11-17\\\\. Shorack, G.R., Wellner, J.A (1986) Empirical Processes with Applications to Statistics, Wiley. p248-250 with additional lines being included on the plot to indicate either specific acceptance regions or the range of expected departure from the 1:1 line. An improved version of the P–P plot, called the SP or S–P plot, is available, which makes use of a variance-stabilizing transformation to create a plot on which the variations about the 1:1 line should be the same at all locations.

The highlands are made up of a series of high valleys enclosed by mountains. The local name for the region is Altos, meaning \\"highlands\\", which includes the northern declivity of the Sierra Madre. The mean elevation is greatest in the west (Altos of Quezaltenango) and least in the east (Altos of Guatemala). A few of the streams of the Pacific slope actually rise in the highlands, and force a way through the Sierra Madre at the bottom of deep ravines. One large river, the Chixoy or Salinas River, escapes northwards towards the Gulf of Mexico. The relief of the mountainous country which lies north of the Highlands and drains into the Atlantic is varied by innumerable terraces, ridges and underfalls; but its general configuration is compared by E. Reclus with the appearance of \\"a stormy sea breaking into parallel billows\\".Universal Geography, ed. E. G. Ravenstein, div. xxxiii., p. 212 The parallel ranges extend east and west with a slight southerly curve towards their centres. A range called the Sierra de Chamá, which, however, changes its name frequently from place to place, strikes eastward towards Belize, and is connected by low hills with the Cockscomb Mountains; another similar range, the Sierra de Santa Cruz, continues east to Cape Cocoli between the Polochic and the Sarstoon; and a third, the Sierra de las Minas or, in its eastern portion, Sierra del Mico, stretches between the Polochic and the Motagua rivers. Between Honduras and Guatemala, the frontier is formed by the Sierra de Merendón. In addition to the streams which break through to the Pacific, a number of larger streams which drain to the Gulf of Mexico or the Caribbean Sea have their sources in the highlands. The Motagua River, whose principal head stream is called the Rio Grande, has a course of about 250 miles, and is navigable to within 90 miles of Guatemala City, which is situated on one of its confluents, the Rio de las Vacas. It empties in the Gulf of Honduras, an arm of the Caribbean. Of similar importance is the Polochic River, which is about 180 miles in length, and navigable about 20 miles above the river-port of Telemán. A vast number of streams, among which are the Chixoy, Lacantún, and Ixcán, unite to form the Usumacinta River, which passes along the Mexican frontier, and flowing on through Chiapas and Tabasco, falls into the Bay of Campeche. The Grijalva and its tributaries the Cuilco and San Miguel rivers drain west into the Chiapas Depression, and from there into the Gulf of Mexico. Lake Atitlan is a land- locked basin encompassed with lofty mountains. About 9 miles south of Guatemala City lies Lake Amatitlan with the town Amatitlán. The highlands have a long occupational history, with many Maya archaeological sites that include Zaculeu, Kaminaljuyu, Iximché, Mixco Viejo, Q'umarkaj, San Mateo Ixtatán, Chitinamit and many more. Climate Tropical savanna climates have monthly mean temperature above 18 °C (64 °F) in every month of the year and typically a pronounced dry season, with the driest month having precipitation less than 60mm (2.36 in) of precipitation.

Career Adams' mother was from Kingston and his father from St. Vincent; the two met while working in Curaçao. Adams' first break in the music business came as a teenager, when he appeared as a singer in a vocal group on Radio Jamaica's Opportunity Knocks show hosted by Vere Johns. Later performing on the same show as a solo singer which led to appearances on cabaret shows and performances in Kingston and St. Andrews at weekends. Adams' older sister Yvonne was also a popular singer and he was spotted by Clement \\"Coxsone\\" Dodd while rehearsing a song that she had written called \\"Wonder Thirst\\". Coxsone took him into the Federal Recording Studio to record the track in 1960. Although not officially released as a single at the time, the song became a popular dub plate on sound systems, and the title of the song became his nickname. Adams formed a duo, Ken and Glen, with Ken Boothe and they came second place in the 1966 Festival Song Competition with \\"I Remember\\". The duo also backed Stranger Cole on his number one single \\"Uno Dos Tres\\". He co-founded The Heptones before moving on to The Pioneers, appearing on the latter's \\"Shake It Up\\" and \\"Good Nanny\\". While continuing to earn a living as a tailor, he moved on to work with Duke Reid's Treasure Isle set-up as an informal musical director, introducing singers such as Joe White to Reid. Adams also worked with Bunny Lee from around 1967 as a solo singer, backing singer and A&R; man, in exchange for studio time. At a recording session in October 1968, when several musicians failed to turn up due to a dispute about payment for a previous session, Adams was asked to play piano, despite not being proficient on the instrument. Unhappy with the results, he switched instruments with organist Lloyd Charmers (although he had never played the organ before). He played organ on eight tracks in that session, which included Lester Sterling's \\"Bangarang\\" and Slim Smith's \\"Everybody Needs Love\\" and he has stuck with the instrument ever since, becoming a regular session player. Along with other musicians such as the Barrett brothers (Aston and Carlton), he performed in sessions for a range of producers under a variety of group names notably The Hippy Boys for Bunny Lee, where Adams did some of his most memorable work accompanying Slim Smith, The Reggae Boys and The Upsetters for Lee \\"Scratch\\" Perry. Adams also worked for Herman Chin Loy, where he was one of a number of keyboard players to record under the name Augustus Pablo, before Horace Swaby adopted that identity. Perry and The Upsetters toured the United Kingdom to capitalise on the success of Perry's hit \\"Return of Django\\" (and the less successful follow-up, \\"Live Injection\\"); returning to Jamaica in 1970. As part of The Upsetters, Adams backed The Wailers during their spell with Perry and Adams did much of the arranging and composed the song \\"Mr. Brown\\". The lyrics were inspired by a local tale about a duppy who was supposedly seen speeding around on a three-wheeled coffin with two \\"John Crows\\" (buzzards) on top, one of which would ask for \\"Mr. Brown\\". Adams was due to record the track himself but Perry suggested that the Wailers record it, with Peter Tosh and Adams adding spooky organ riffs. Adams regularly introduced this song at his concerts with the statement: \\"I wrote this song for Bob Marley\\". When The Wailers parted company with Perry in 1971 taking The Upsetter's rhythm section with them, Adams remained with Perry. During this period he had also started to split his time between Jamaica and the United States. In the United States he set up his own Capo record label and put together a new band, the Blue Grass Experience. He eventually moved to Brooklyn permanently in 1975, where he became more involved in producing and also worked for Brad Osbourne's Clocktower and Lloyd Barnes' Bullwackie labels and played with The Realistics band. In the late 1970s, Adams expanded into R&B; and Rap production, working with hip hop artist T Ski Valley. He also worked with Shaggy and remixed and re-voiced an album of partly Upsetters material in 1996, released by Heartbeat Records as Upsetters a Go Go. After many years in the studio, Adams returned to live performance in the 2000s, touring the USA and Europe with The Slackers and also playing occasional NYC shows with the Jammyland All-Stars. Adams owned his own recording studio and in his later years produced artists such as Susan Cadogan and Keith Rowe, half of the vocal duo Keith & Tex from Jamaica. Glen Adams died on 17 December 2010 at the University Hospital of the West Indies after falling ill while visiting Jamaica.

The Dictionary of National Biography says of the masque, \\"This vindication of love from wealth is a defense of the court revels against the strictures of the puritan city.\\" Compared to Jonson's previous masques for the Stuart Court, Love Restored was unusual in several respects. Love Restored could be called a \\"budget\\" masque, in that its total bill was only in the hundreds of pounds rather than the thousands; specifically, it cost only £280.Michael Leapman, Inigo: The Troubled Life of Inigo Jones, Architect of the English Renaissance, London, Headline Book Publishing, 2003; p. 125. In this it was different from Jonson's earlier masques like The Masque of Blackness and others, though similar to the immediately preceding masque, Love Freed from Ignorance and Folly. Even more unusually, Love Restored was staged without the participation of Inigo Jones, who had designed the costumes, sets, and stage effects of the prior masques. Aristocratic amateurs of the Court danced ten roles, personifications of Honour, Courtesy, Valour, etc.E. K. Chambers, The Elizabethan Stage, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1923; Vol. 3, p. 387.

The masque is dominated by a long conversation among Robin Goodfellow and other mythical figures. \\"Masquerado,\\" the presenter, apologizes for the lack of music and the generally meager values of the presentation. Plutus, the god of wealth, is pretending to be Cupid, and Robin exposes him and offers to lead Masquerado to the real god. Robin also narrates the difficulties he had in gaining entry to the masque -- he had to \\"go through more than forty disguises\\" in his attempt to get in -- a passage that has been taken to indicate the tactics that people actually employed to gain entry to masque performances in the era.Leapman, p. 69 The text of the masque was published in the first folio collection of Jonson's works in 1616, and was reprinted in the second folio of 1640 and in later collections.

In 1918, a proposal was made to build another line to coal interests around Ohai, and the construction of this line was fiercely opposed by the Nightcaps Coal Company, fearing a loss of business. However, construction was approved in July 1919 with a deviation through Morley Village, considered part of Nightcaps. The first section of the line, including the part serving Morley Village, opened on 1 September 1920.

In addition, Mack hosted the syndicated radio show Country Crossroads, heard on more than 800 stations across the country, and a similar cable television show on FamilyNet. He also hosted the Overdrive Top Ten Countdown, a weekly one-hour country music countdown geared toward truckers, in syndication. Mack left WBAP to join XM Satellite Radio on its Open Road channel (XM 171). Two of the other main personalities on Open Road, Dave Nemo and Dale \\"The Truckin' Bozo\\" Sommers, were Mack's primary competitors before all three left their AM radio stations to join XM. Mack's radio program was heard weekdays on XM channel 13 from 12 Noon to 3 PM Eastern, and rebroadcast from Midnight to 3 AM Eastern. On April 29, 2011, Mack announced that Sirius/XM had terminated his contract to make room for a merger of two of the channels The Roadhouse and Willie's Place into one channel and that this was his final show. Mack was succeeded on his WBAP show by Eric Harley, and the show has since been renamed the Midnight Radio Network. In the country music industry, Mack was also a songwriter. His best- known song is \\"Blue,\\" one of LeAnn Rimes' biggest hits. The song won Mack the Grammy Award for Best Country Song in 1997. Mack also wrote \\"Drinking Champagne,\\" which has been recorded by numerous artists. The song was a hit for Cal Smith in 1968, and again for George Strait in 1990 on his album Livin' It Up. Some of his other songs have been recorded by Dean Martin, Ray Price, Jerry Lee Lewis and George Jones. In 2000, Mack won the media category award given by the Grand Ole Opry. He was named to the Texas Country Music Hall of Fame in 1999, and the Country Music DJ and Radio Hall of Fame in 1982. Bill Mack lived in Fort Worth, Texas, with his wife, Cynthia. They had three children - Misty Dawn, Billy Mack III, and Sunday Renee. They had several grandchildren. Bill Mack had a daughter named Debbie from a previous marriage. Bill Mack Smith III (\\"Billy\\") has followed in his father's footsteps and has his own radio show with 92.1 Hank FM in Fort Worth, Texas. Mack died on July 31, 2020. According to his family he had been diagnosed with COVID-19 two days prior.

Exhibits focus on the food's history, its many historical and regional varieties, and its importance to Korean culture and cuisine. The museum collects data and statistics on kimchi and regularly offers activities for visitors, such as demonstrations of the kimchi-making process, kimchi tastings, and cooking classes. The Kimchi Field Museum was Korea's first food museum. In 2015, it was selected by CNN as one of the world's best food museums. General information The Kimchi Field Museum was established in 1986, and is located in the Jongno District of Seoul, South Korea. The museum was reopened at Insa-dong, Jongno District, Seoul, Korea on April 21, 2015. History The Kimchi Field Museum was originally established in 1986 in Pil-dong, Jung-gu. From 1987, the museum was managed by Pulmuone Inc., one of the largest food production companies in Korea. In 1988, the museum was moved to the COEX (Convention and Exhibition Center) in connection with the Summer Olympic Games held in Seoul, South Korea.Museum Kimchikan, English intro. In 2000, the museum was renovated so as to expand and improve its facilities for visitors in anticipation of the third Asia–Europe Meeting in Seoul, designed to deepen political, economic, and cultural relationships between its 41 member countries. Permanent exhibition Various kimchi The first part of the museum has three sections covering the long history of kimchi, including a detailed timeline for visitors. * The Exhibition of Ancient Books on the History of Kimchi * Kimchi Trends throughout Korean History * How hot peppers became a kimchi ingredient The second branch of the Kimchi Field Museum consists of displays on the process of kimchi making, as well as short documentaries which play at regular intervals. Here, visitors can view models of 80 different kinds of kimchi and compare recipes (with a picture and description for each). In addition, there is information about what kinds of spices people have used before they adopted red peppers from Japan and Korea. Another section illustrates the regional varieties of kimchi by geographic district. The museum provides detailed explanations of the process of making kimchi, with a diorama for each step. There is also one section in which people can view the typical environment in which kimchi would be made, including the historic pottery forms used for the fermentation and storage processes. There are two photo zones where people can take pictures of kimchi, a display on the nutritional benefits of kimchi, and compare it with other kinds of fermented vegetables around the world. Guests are also welcome to visit an area where they can observe the Lactobacillus bacteria in kimchi through a microscope. The museum also displays a large world map with countries to which Kimchi is exported. A tasting room is open for visitors to test two different kinds of kimchi each month. The final section of the museum consists of a resource room, where people can read books about kimchi and other traditional foods of Korea. Visitors can access kimchi-related articles and movies in the resource room.

The Palazzo della Consulta (built 1732-1735) is a late Baroque palace in central Rome, Italy, that since 1955 houses the Constitutional Court of the Italian Republic. It sits across the Piazza del Quirinale from the official residence of the President of the Italian Republic, the Quirinal Palace. History Prior to the 17th century, a palace had been erected for the Cardinal Ferrero during the reign of Pope Sixtus V. The Pope Clement XII (Corsini) commissioned the present palace from Ferdinando Fuga, and it was completed in 1737 to house the secretariat of the Sacra Congregazione della Consulta (which served as the main council of state of the Papal states and tribunal) as well as the Segnatura dei Brevi, as well as two corps of Papal Guard units. From 1798 to 1814, the palace was used as the Prefecture of Rome. In 1849, during the Roman Republic, it was the home of the ruling Triumvirate. After the annexation of the Papal States to the Kingdom of Italy, from 1871 to 1874, Prince Umberto I and his wife Margherita of Savoy lived here. From 1874 to 1922, it housed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and from 1924 to 1953 it housed the Ministry of Colonies. In 1955, it became the home of the Constitutional Court of Italy. Fuga ordered the two- storey facade with a piano nobile whose windows have low arched heads set in fielded panels, over a ground floor with low mezzanine. On the lower story the panels have channeled rustication and rusticated quoins at the corners. Pilasters are applied only to the central three-bay block, which barely projects, and to the corners. The roof-line of the facade is topped by a large coat of arms of the Corsini pope, and is similar to the one of Fontana di Trevi. Lower down, at the entrance, a King of Italy installed his coat of arms. The interiors have undergone a series of fresco decorations over the centuries. The initial 18th-century frescoes by Antonio Bicchierai and Giovanni Domenico Piastrini, are nearly vanished except for a few allegorical figures in the apartments of the Cardinals. In 1787, the new Cardinale dei Brevi, Cardinal Romoaldo Braschi-Onesti, had the palaced redecorated by Bernardino Nocchi, which was also nearly lost except for frescoes on the Myth of Proserpine in the \\"Salone Pompeiano\\" and decoration in the ceiling of the \\"Studio dei Giudici\\" depicting charity and the four virtues.

The conflict began on May 17, 1980. It is estimated that there have been nearly 70,000 deaths, making it the bloodiest war in Peruvian history, since the European colonization of the country. The high death toll includes many civilian casualties, due to deliberate targeting by many factions. Since 2000, the number of deaths has dropped significantly and recently the conflict has become dormant. There were low-level resurgences of violence in 2002 and 2014 when conflict erupted between the Peruvian Army and Guerrilla remnants in the VRAEM region. The conflict has lasted for over 40 years, making it the second longest internal conflict in the history of Latin America, after the Colombian armed conflict. Background Prior to the conflict, Peru had undergone a series of coups with frequent switches between political parties and ideologies. On October 2, 1968, General Juan Velasco Alvarado staged a military coup and became Peru's 56th president under the administration of the Revolutionary Government of the Armed Forces, left-leaning military dictatorship. Following a period of widespread poverty and unemployment, Velasco himself was overthrown in a bloodless military coup on August 29, 1975. He was replaced by Francisco Morales Bermúdez as the new President of Peru. Morales announced that his rule would provide a \\"Second Phase\\" to the previous administration, which would bring political and economic reforms. However, he was unsuccessful in delivering these promises, and in 1978, a Constitutional Assembly was created to replace Peru's 1933 Constitution. Morales then proclaimed that national elections would be held by 1980. Elections were held for the Constituent Assembly on June 18, 1978, whilst martial law was imposed on January 6, 1979. The Assembly approved the new constitution in July 1979. On May 18, 1980, Fernando Belaúnde Terry was elected president. Between February 1966 and July 1980 approximately 500 people died of political violence. Many affiliated with Peru's Communist Party had opposed the creation of the new constitution and formed the extremist organization known as the PCP. This ultimately led to the emergence of internal conflict, with the first attacks taking place a day before the elections. Despite this, national elections continued and Fernando Belaúnde Terry was elected as the 58th President of Peru in 1980. Terry had already served as the country's 55th president prior to Velasco's coup in 1968.  Communist Party of Peru During the governments of Velasco and Morales, Communist Party of Peru had been organized as a Maoist political group formed in 1970 by Abimael Guzmán, a communist professor of philosophy at the San Cristóbal of Huamanga University. Guzmán had been inspired by the Chinese Cultural Revolution which he had witnessed first-hand during a trip to China. PCP members engaged in street fights with members of other political groups and painted graffiti encouraging an \\"armed struggle\\" against the Peruvian state. In June 1979, demonstrations for free education were severely repressed by the army: 18 people were killed according to official figures, but non- governmental estimates suggest several dozen deaths. This event led to a radicalization of political protests in the countryside and the outbreak of the PCP's terrorist actions.Luis Rossell, Rupay: historias gráficas de la violencia en el Perú, 1980-1984, 2008  Timeline = Outbreak of hostilities (1980-1982)  When Peru's military government allowed elections for the first time in 1980, the Communist Party of Peru was one of the few leftist political groups that declined to take part. They opted instead to launch guerrilla warfare actions against the state in the province of Ayacucho. On May 17, 1980—the eve of the presidential elections—members of the PCP burned ballot boxes in the town of Chuschi, Ayacucho. The perpetrators were quickly caught and additional ballots were brought in to replace the burned ballots; the elections proceeded without any further incidents. The incident received very little attention in the Peruvian press.The Shining Path: A History of the Millenarian War in Peru. p. 17. Gorriti, Gustavo trans. Robin Kirk, The University of North Carolina Press: Chapel Hill and London, 1999 (). The PCP opted to fight in the manner advocated by Mao Zedong. They would open up \\"guerrilla zones\\" in which their guerrillas could operate and drive government forces out of these zones to create \\"liberated zones\\". These zones would then be used to support new guerrilla zones until the entire country was essentially a unified \\"liberated zone\\". There is some disagreement among scholars about the extent of Maoist influence on the PCP, but the majority of scholars consider the PCP to be a violent Maoist organization. One of the factors contributing to support for this view among scholars is that PCP's economic and political base were located primarily in rural areas and they sought to build up their influence in these areas.Jonathan R. White. Terrorism and Homeland Security, p240. On December 3, 1982, the Communist Party of Peru officially formed an armed wing known as the \\"People's Guerrilla Army\\". The Peruvian guerrillas were peculiar in that they had a high proportion of women, 50 per cent of the combatants and 40 per cent of the commanders were women.Género y conflicto armado en el Perú, Sous la direction d’Anouk Guiné et de Maritza Felices-Luna = Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement = 180px In 1982, the Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) launched its own guerrilla against the Peruvian state. The group had been formed by remnants of the Movement of the Revolutionary Left and identified with Castroite guerrilla movements in other parts of Latin America. The MRTA used techniques that were more traditional to Latin American leftist organizations, like wearing uniforms, claiming to fight for true democracy, and accusations of human rights abuses by the state; in contrast, the PCP did not wear uniforms and did not care for electoral processes, instead seeking democracy for the people. During the conflict, the MRTA and the PCP engaged in combat with each other. The MRTA only played a small part in the overall conflict, being declared by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to have been responsible for 1.5 percent of casualties accumulated throughout the conflict. At its height, the MRTA was believed to have consisted of only a few hundred members.La Comisión de la Verdad y Reconciliación. Final Report. \\"General Conclusions.\\" Available online. Accessed February 3, 2007.  Government response (1981)  Gradually, the PCP committed more and more violent attacks on the National Police of Peru until the Lima-based government could no longer ignore the growing crisis. In 1981, President Fernando Belaúnde Terry declared a state of emergency and ordered that the Peruvian Armed Forces fight Shining Path. Constitutional rights were suspended for 60 days in the Huamanga, Huanta, Cangallo, La Mar, and the Víctor Fajardo Provinces. Later, the Armed Forces created the Ayacucho Emergency Zone, where military law superseded civilian law. The military committed many human right violations in the area where it had political control, including the infamous Accomarca massacre. Scores of peasant farmers were massacred by the armed forces.BBC News. \\"Peruvians seek relatives in mass grave.\\" June 12, 2008. Available online. Retrieved June 12, 2008. A special US-trained \\"counter terrorist\\" police battalion is known as the \\"Sinchis\\" became notorious in the 1980s for their violations of human rights.Palmer, David Scott (2007). The revolutionary terrorism of Peru's Shining Path. In Martha Crenshaw, Ed. Terrorism in Context. University Park, PA: Pennsylvania State University Press. The PCP's reaction to the Peruvian government's use of the military in the conflict was to increase violent warfare in the countryside. Shining Path attacked police officers, soldiers, and civilians that it considered being \\"class enemies\\", often using gruesome methods of killing their victims. These killings, along with Shining Path's disrespect for the culture of indigenous peasants, turned many civilians in the Sierra away from the group.  PCP massacres (1982-1989)  Faced with a hostile population, Shining Path's guerrilla campaigns began to falter. In some areas, fearful, well-off peasants formed anti-Shining Path patrols called rondas. They were generally poorly equipped despite donations of guns from the armed forces. Nevertheless, Shining Path guerrillas were attacked by the rondas. The first reported attack was near Huata in January 1983, where some rondas killed 13 guerrillas. In February in Sacsamarca, rondas stabbed and killed the Shining Path commanders of that area. In March 1983, rondas brutally killed Olegario Curitomay, one of the commanders of the town of Lucanamarca. They took him to the town square, stoned him, stabbed him, set him on fire, and finally shot him.La Comisión de la Verdad y Reconciliación. \\"La Masacre de Lucanamarca (1983).\\" August 28, 2003.

Administration of Alberto Fujimori (1990–2000) and decline Under the administration of Alberto Fujimori the state started its widespread use of intelligence agencies in its fight against Shining Path. Some atrocities were committed by the National Intelligence Service, notably the La Cantuta massacre, the Barrios Altos massacre and the Santa massacre. On April 5, 1992, Fujimori dissolved the Congress of Peru and abolished the Constitution, initiating the Peruvian Constitutional Crisis of 1992. The reason for these actions was that Congress was slow to pass anti- terrorism legislation. Fujimori set up military courts to try suspected members of the Shining Path and MRTA and ordered that an \\"iron fist\\" approach be used. Fujimori also announced that Peru would no longer be under the jurisdiction of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. As Shining Path began to lose ground in the Andes to the Peruvian state and the rondas, it decided to speed up its overall strategic plan. Shining Path declared that it had reached \\"strategic equilibrium\\" and was ready to begin its final assault on the cities of Peru. In 1992, Shining Path set off a powerful bomb in the Miraflores District of Lima in what became known as the Tarata bombing. This was part of a larger bombing campaign to follow suit in Lima. On September 12, 1992, Peruvian police captured Guzmán and several Shining Path leaders in an apartment above a dance studio in the Surquillo district of Lima. The police had been monitoring the apartment, as a number of suspected Shining Path militants had visited it. An inspection of the garbage of the apartment produced empty tubes of a skin cream used to treat psoriasis, a condition that Guzmán was known to have. Shortly after the raid that captured Guzmán, most of the remaining Shining Path leadership fell as well.Rochlin, James F. Vanguard Revolutionaries in Latin America: Peru, Colombia, Mexico. p. 71. Lynne Rienner Publishers: Boulder and London, 2003. (). At the same time, Shining Path suffered embarrassing military defeats to peasant self-defense organizations – supposedly its social base – and the organization fractured into splinter groups. Guzmán's role as the leader of Shining Path was taken over by Óscar Ramírez, who himself was captured by Peruvian authorities in 1999. After Ramírez's capture, the group splintered, guerrilla activity diminished sharply and previous conditions returned to the areas where the Shining Path had been active.Rochlin, James F. Vanguard Revolutionaries in Latin America: Peru, Colombia, Mexico. pp. 71–72. Lynne Rienner Publishers: Boulder and London, 2003. (). Some Shining Path and MRTA remnants managed to stage minor scale attacks, such as the January 1993 wave of attacks and political assassinations that occurred in the run-up to the municipal elections, which also targeted US interests; these included the bombing of two Coca-Cola plants on January 22 (by Shining Path); the RPG attack against the USIS Binational Center on January 16; the bombing of a KFC restaurant on January 21 (both by the MRTA) and the car-bombing of the Peruvian headquarters of IBM on January 28 (by Shining Path).United States Department of State On July 27, 1993, Shining Path militants drove a car bomb into the US Embassy in Lima, which left extensive damage on the complex (worth some US$250,000) and nearby buildings. Shining Path was confined to their former headquarters in the Peruvian jungle and continued smaller attacks against the military, like the one that occurred on October 2, 1999, when a Peruvian Army helicopter was shot down by SP guerrillas near Satipo (killing 5) and stealing a PKM machine gun which was reportedly used in another attack against an Mi-17 in July 2003. Despite Shining Path being mostly defeated, more than 25% of Peru's national territory remained under a state of emergency until early 2000. Truth and Reconciliation Commission Alberto Fujimori resigned the Presidency in 2000, but Congress declared him \\"morally unfit\\", installing the opposite congress member Valentín Paniagua into office. He rescinded Fujimori's announcement that Peru would leave the Inter-American Court of Human Rights and established a Truth and Reconciliation Commission (CVR) to investigate the conflict. The commission was headed by the President of Catholic University Salomón Lerner Febres.

According to a summary of the report by Human Rights Watch, \\"Shining Path... killed about half the victims, and roughly one- third died at the hands of government security forces...

During World War II, he became chief of staff of the Home Army (ZWZ, Armia Krajowa; July 1941 – October 1944) and its deputy commander (July 1943 – October 1944). Early life and education Tadeusz Pełczyński was the son of Ksawery Pełczyński, a Sanniki sugar-mill technician, and Maria, née Liczbińska, a teacher, and was a great-grandson of Michał Pełczyński, a general in the Army of Congress Poland. Pełczyński began school in Łęczyca. In 1905 he participated in a school strike connected with Polish efforts to win independence from the Russian Empire. He continued his schooling in Warsaw at the Gen. Paweł Chrzanowski Gymnasium. In 1911 he began medical studies at Kraków University. As a medical student he was a member of the patriotic- gymnastic Sokół organisation and of the \\"Zet\\" Polish Youth Association (Związek Młodzieży Polskiej \\"Zet\\").Charaszkiewicz, p. 68. He completed a military course conducted by Zygmunt Zieliński, a future Polish Army generał broni (lieutenant general). Marriage and family In 1923 Pełczyński married Wanda Filipowska, with whom he had a daughter, Maria, and a son, Krzysztof (Christopher, born 1924, who died during the Warsaw Uprising on 17 August 1944, of wounds sustained on 1 August, the first day of the Uprising). World War I Second lieutenant (Podporucznik) Tadeusz Pełczyński, ca. 1916 The outbreak of World War I in August 1914 found Pełczyński on vacation near Włocławek. After the area had been occupied by the Germans, he was mobilised by them to work as a medic at a Russian-prisoner-of-war camp. After his release from German service, in June 1915 he joined the Polish Legions. He served as an officer in the 6th Legions Infantry Regiment (6 Pułk Piechoty Legionów) and commanded a platoon and a company. In July 1917, following the Oath Crisis, he was interned at a camp in Beniaminów. In March 1918, after release from internment, he took up work at a social-services agency (Rada Główna Opiekuńcza) while continuing his involvement with \\"Zet.\\" Interwar period In November 1918 Pełczyński was accepted into the Polish Army and placed in command of a company, then a battalion, of the 6th Legions' Infantry Regiment. In March 1920 he was transferred to the Infantry Officer-Cadet School (Szkoła Podchorążych Piechoty) in Warsaw as a company commander, then a battalion commander. From September 1921 to September 1923 he attended the War College (Wyższa Szkoła Wojenna) in Warsaw. After graduating with a General Staff officer's diploma, he returned to the Infantry Officer-Cadet School as a battalion commander. In July 1924 he was posted to the Office of the Inner War Council (Ścisła Rada Wojenna). In May 1927 he began service in the Second Department of Polish General Staff (the intelligence section) as chief of the Information Department (Wydział Ewidencyjny). In January 1929 he was appointed chief of Section II. From March 1932 to September 1935 he commanded the 5th Legions' Infantry Regiment (5 Pułk Piechoty Legionów) in Wilno (it was part of the elite 1st Legions Infantry Division), then returned to again head Section II. As chief of the Second Department of Polish General Staff, Pełczyński, like his predecessor Colonel Tadeusz Schaetzel and like deputy chief Lt. Col. Józef Englicht, was very supportive of Marshal Józef Piłsudski's Promethean project, aimed at liberating the non-Russian peoples of the Soviet Union.Andrzej Grzywacz et al., introduction to Zbiór dokumentów ppłk. Edmunda Charaszkiewicza (A Collection of Documents by Lt. Col. Edmund Charaszkiewicz), p. 15. Pełczyński was the longest-serving prewar chief of the Second Department (1929–32, and 1935 – January 1939). In January 1939 he was relieved of this post and placed in command of the 19th Infantry Division (19 Dywizja Piechoty), stationed in Wilno. His tenure as chief of Section II had reportedly been ended by his wife Wanda's political activities against Marshal Edward Śmigły-Rydz and General Felicjan Sławoj-Składkowski. World War II Tadeusz Pełczyński, ca. 1945 Pełczyński may have made his greatest contribution to Allied victory in World War II well before the opening of hostilities, when he proposed giving Polish knowledge of the German Enigma machine to the French and British. According to Colonel Stefan Mayer, \\"From Gen. Pełczyński, now resident in Great Britain, I know that... he suggested [to the chief of the Polish General Staff, General Wacław Stachiewicz] that in case of [impending] war the Enigma secret... be used as our Polish contribution to the common... defence and divulged to our future allies. [Pełczyński] repeated [this] to Col. Józef Smoleński when in [the] first days of January 1939 [Smoleński] replaced [him] as... head of [Section II]. That was the basis of [Lt. Col. Langer]'s instructions... when he... represent[ed] the Polish side at the [Paris] conference... in January 1939 and then in Warsaw in July 1939.Władysław Kozaczuk, Enigma, p. 64. The Poles' gift, to their British and French allies, of Enigma decryption at Warsaw on 26 July 1939, just five weeks before the outbreak of the war, came not a moment too soon, as it laid the foundations for later British cryptographic breakthroughs that produced the Ultra intelligence that was a key factor during the war. Former Bletchley Park mathematician-cryptologist Gordon Welchman later wrote: \\"Ultra] would never have gotten off the ground if we had not learned from the Poles, in the nick of time, the details both of the German military... Enigma machine, and of the operating procedures that were in use.\\"Gordon Welchman, The Hut Six Story, p. 289. After the outbreak of war, from 5 September 1939, Pełczyński commanded a force in the rears of the invading German Wehrmacht. After the conclusion of the September Campaign, he went to Warsaw to take up underground work with the Service for Polish Victory (Służba Zwycięstwu Polski), then with the Union for Armed Resistance (Związek Walki Zbrojnej, or ZWZ) and the Home Army (Armia Krajowa, or AK). From July 1940 to April 1941 he commanded the Lublin ZWZ district. As the local Gestapo were closing in, he returned to Warsaw and accepted the post of chief of staff of ZWZ (July 1941). From July 1943, he was also Home Army deputy commander. In November 1943, he was promoted to major general (generał brygady). He commanded sabotage operations carried out by Kedyw units against the German war machine (including disruption of several rail lines). He took part in the decision to begin the Warsaw uprising. Five weeks into the Warsaw Uprising, on 4 September 1944, Pełczyński was gravely wounded when the PKO savings-bank building on Świętokrzyska Street was bombed, and as a result he could no longer carry on the duties of Home Army chief of staff. After the suppression of the Uprising, Pełczyński was imprisoned by the Germans at the Langwasser camp, then at Colditz. Later years Following his liberation by the Allies in 1945, he made his way to London in England.

Crucifixion by Ciro Ferri. Santa Maria dell'Orazione e Morte (Saint Mary of the Prayer and Death) is a church in central Rome, Italy. It lies on Via Giulia between the Tiber and the Palazzo Farnese. First built in 1575, the church was completely rebuilt by Ferdinando Fuga in 1733 using an elliptical plan. Inside may be seen frescoes of St. Anthony Abbot and St. Paul of Thebes by Giovanni Lanfranco; these were removed and transferred to this church from a now-lost structure built by Odoardo Farnese. In the first chapel at the right is a Mystical marriage of Saint Catherine; in the main chapel is a Crucifixion altarpiece (1680) by Ciro Ferri. In the second chapel to the left is St Giuliana Falconieri Receives the Habit From St. Filippo Benizi (1740) by Pier Leone Ghezzi. In the first chapel to the left features an altarpiece of the Rest on the Flight to Egypt painted by Lorenzo Masucci. thumb Additionally, the church houses a chamber decorated with human bones; a large number of skulls, candelabras constructed of bones, and a large cross adorned with skulls are among the room's adornments. This chamber is located through a door to the left of the main altar and is rarely open to visitors. Detail of human bones chandelier in chamber of Santa Maria dell'Orazione e Morte Santa Maria was built by a confraternity that assumed responsibility for interring abandoned corpses in Rome. It is remarkable for the depictions of laureled skulls over the façade entrance and other death imagery. In this it has some of the morbid encrustations also seen in the Roman church of the Capuchins. Its charity was, and still is, supported by the Arciconfraternita di Santa Maria dell'Orazione e Morte, a purgatorial society dating to the 1560s. Burials were performed in their cemetery, once sited on the banks of the Tiber adjacent to the church. Architect Fuga and San Carlo Borromeo were members of the fraternity.

Founded in 1949 it predominantly serves the areas of Birkenhead, Beach Haven, Birkdale, Kauri Park, Chelsea, and Birkenhead East, a population of about 26,000, including six primary schools, two intermediate schools, and two colleges.Fisher, Muriel and Hilder, Wenman. (1969). Birkenhead: the kauri suburb, Birkenhead: Birkenhead Borough Council, p. 101.Statistics New Zealand. (2006). Community Profiles accessed Feb 2007. Typical of medium-sized public libraries in New Zealand, it is able to provide an extensive range of modern library resources and services through its integration into a wider urban network, and through its association with the National Library, while retaining its own distinct, local connections such as the Archives Collection of the Chelsea Sugar Refinery. The library was the first public library to be founded in North Shore City, the first to offer dial-up access to the New Zealand Bibliographic Network, and a leading proponent of full weekend services. For four years the library was located in temporary quarters in the Birkenhead Leisure Centre, while a dispute over the location and design of its proposed new building was resolved. On 17 December 2009, a new Birkenhead Library and Civic Centre was opened on the site of the former library.  History  The history of Birkenhead Public Library is characterized by four transformations which occurred at approximately twenty-year intervals since its founding in 1949. Three of these transformations involved new buildings, while the other involved amalgamation into the wider North Shore Libraries system. There was also an unexpectedly long interim period when the library was based at the Leisure Centre.  Founding of the library  At the turn of the twentieth century, apart from \\"subscription libraries\\" the only library in Birkenhead was run by the Zion Hill Methodist Church. In 1901, the Birkenhead Borough Council resolved that its legal and finance committee should consider building a public one, but little eventuated.Fisher, Muriel and Hilder, Wenman. (1969). Birkenhead: the kauri suburb, Birkenhead: Birkenhead Borough Council, p. 102.Haddon, Kathy. (1993). Birkenhead: the way we were, Birkenhead: North Shore City Council, p. 45. A subsidy of £100 was sought from the government in 1904 for a building \\"not to exceed a total of £600\\". However, it was not until 1949 that the Free Birkenhead Public Library was established in the basement of the Council Chambers, opening on 14 November. It was a modest beginning, bolstered by support from the National Library. There was an initial budget of £500 (about $35,984 in 1st Quarter of 2017).Reserve Bank of New Zealand Inflation Calculator The library began with a collection of around 1500 items, \\"swelled by about another twenty books a month.\\"\\"The last word in library service,\\" North Shore Times Advertiser, 26 Apr 1968, p. 6.Reed, Kim. \\"Reserve zone change on the books,\\" North Shore Times, 29 Sep 2005, p. 3.

Birkenhead: the kauri suburb, Birkenhead: Birkenhead Borough Council, p. 101. Nora Bourke, the chairman of the Library Committee, felt the existing building was limited and, with mayor Cyril Crocombe, began making plans for a much larger building. This was to be built on the Civic Reserve, on which a World War One memorial has stood since 1927. On 20 April 1968, the new building was officially opened by the Governor General Arthur Porritt.\\"New page in Birkenhead history,\\" North Shore Times Advertiser, 26 April 1968, p. 4Christie, Colleen.

For the next 37 years, until 2005, this was the location of the Birkenhead Public Library, and in 1979 the reserve was renamed Nell Fisher Reserve after the first librarian, Eleanor \\"Nell\\" Fisher.  Amalgamation  North Shore Libraries at amalgamation. The 1980s saw an increase in the depth and variety of services offered. A Bedford vanGraham, Rata. (1992). Birkenhead Library: A history, Birkenhead: North Shore Libraries, pp. 1-2. was used to start a mobile library service in 1982, and the library began opening on Saturdays in 1983. In 1986, children’s multimedia items were offered for the first time, and the New Zealand Bibliographic Network link was established. Soon after, compact discs were made available, while in 1987 the library began opening on Sundays. So service was now provided over the entire week, a first in New Zealand.Graham, Rata. (1992).

Borrowers were now directly registered onto the computer, and a new computer management system went live, \\"the most sophisticated...in the world.\\"Graham, Rata. (1992). Birkenhead Library: A history, Birkenhead: North Shore Libraries, p. 4.

Welcome to the self-issue machine. First introduced to Birkenhead Library in 1995, this is a later version. However, perhaps the most significant event of the eighties was amalgamation of the Birkenhead and Northcote Boroughs, and the subsequent merging of the local libraries into the North Shore Libraries system in 1989 (pictured).Norsburgh, Megan. \\"Supercity swears in its mayors and councillors,\\" North Shore Times Advertiser, 31 Oct 1989, p. 3. Staff were redeployed and regional development was initiated. A new division, Technical Services, became fully operational at Takapuna. A Children’s Services Co- ordinator was appointed, and the computer management system established the year before was improved to allow universal access to the six libraries’ holdings.Graham, Rata.

This convergence has continued to this day with the advent of the \\"eLGAR\\" conglomerate, the Libraries of the Greater Auckland Region.The eLGAR website is simply the grouping of all the constituents catalogues. However, in December 2007 they started the eLGAR Blog which aims to be more informative.

On 1 May 2000, a time capsule was buried out in front of the library, by the Birkenhead war memorial. It contained various items such as maps, driver's licences, shopping receipts, and old library cards from the 1960s and 1970s. Blessed by a kaumatua from Awataha Marae it was planned to be dug up in one hundred years. On the plaque are quoted the opening two lines from T. S. Eliot's poem Burnt Norton.

Over 500 people a day were entering the library and new members were growing at a rate of 150 per month. Finding room to add new material to the existing stock of some 67,500 items was becoming increasingly difficult.\\"Library list of woes make sad reading,\\" North Shore Times Advertiser, 10 Jun 2003, p. 1. Another factor driving the need for change was the absence of enough space for community groups, such as primary schools and students, bookclubs,\\"Booktalk group,\\" North Shore Times Advertiser, 20 May 2003. and author events.\\"Handbooks presented to librarian,\\" North Shore Times Advertiser, 14 May 2003. By the end of the 1990s some sort of addition to the library or a rebuild was being actively considered. In 2005, in preparation for building works on the same site, the library was shifted to a converted basketball court in the Birkenhead Leisure Centre in Mahara Avenue (pictured). Other alternative sites had been considered, but most were found to be either inappropriate or too expensive.Report of a meeting: Community Services & Parks Committee , North Shore City Council, 9 September 2004.

In fact only 50% to 60% of the library's own stock could be accommodated. $175,000 was budgeted for the fitout of the basketball court,Report of a meeting: Community Services & Parks Committee , North Shore City Council, 14 April 2005. and included such things as improved lighting, car park access, and funding for a passenger lift to allow for disabled patrons.Report of a meeting: Community Services & Parks Committee , North Shore City Council, 30 November 2004.Birkenhead Library webpage, North Shore Libraries.

This location was meant to be a transitional arrangement while the new building was being constructed. However, the library remained at this temporary location for four years.See Controversy over the new building  The current library  One of several Council signs around the Nell Fisher reserve. Note also, the artist's impression of the first version of the new library. Brendan Rawson, from the Architecture Office The Architecture Office - Home in Ponsonby, was retained in 2004 to design a building that would create the much needed public space; and in addition, reflect the heritage of the area.This is the first recorded meeting. Report of a meeting: Community Services & Parks Committee , North Shore City Council, 12, 13, 24 Aug 2004. Initial concepts took advantage of the considerable potential for views, and incorporated extensive additional landscaping, from more trees to poppies.'Report of a meeting: Community Services & Parks Committee , North Shore City Council, 30 November 2004. The first completed design, (pictured), evoked the kauri that were once endemic to the region. Shadow-patterns of branches etched on the windows were reminiscent of the trees in the reserve, one of which was itself a kauri, planted in 1987 to commemorate environmentalist Bill Fisher. There was also to be a cafe on the second floor and a drive-thru at basement level for dropping off returns. This version was planned to be two metres higher than the previous building, with 1200 m2 of floorspace set aside for the library. Put out to public scrutiny there was some negative feedback. Peter White, a local resident, was critical of the design, calling the building \\"strange...full of different angles.\\" Community board member Tony Holman wanted more thought put into the heritage aspects, though he did not specify any details. The Friends of the Library, on the other hand, were unanimous in their praise. Another important aspect of the design was that it would also be a sustainable building. This commitment to the environment was an increasingly significant part of North Shore City Council's approach to urban development, especially through the Resource Management Act and the Treaty of Waitangi.North Shore City Council. \\"About North Shore City Council\\" , North Shore City Council, undated.

The library design incorporated several notable features, including the maximisation of natural light, the use of recyclable material, including reuse of grey water, and a natural ventilation and cooling system to limit energy costs. After the Environment Court decision (see below) this design underwent some modification, but the library opened on 17 December 2009 with a formal opening ceremony in February 2010.  Controversy over the new building  In preparation for a new community library complex the old Birkenhead Library was demolished in May 2005. The library service was temporarily relocated to a basketball court in the Birkenhead Leisure Centre. It was expected to be there for eighteen months. However, the project was then delayed for several years; and was not completed until December 2009.  Cost of delays  View from Birkenhead Library site. The library building is sited further forward, approximately on the brown patch of mown grass. Proposed levels would have given public access to even more expansive views encompassing the Hauraki Gulf, Sky Tower, and Mt Eden, etc. The initial focus of the library project was on upgrading the existing building. When the second floor was built on top of the library in the early 1970s, it initially housed the Council Area Office,White & White Ltd. North Shore City Council Birkenhead building feasibility study. Tauranga: White & White Ltd, 2000, p. 4. though it was conceived even then that it would eventually be used as library space.Christie, Colleen. (1988). Back then: oral history interviews from the Birkenhead Public Library collection, Birkenhead: Birkenhead City Council, vol 3, p. 25. However, investigations in 1999 by engineers revealed that the second level floor was too weak to support the weight of books without significant strengthening, which would be expensive to undertake. As well, the existing building was showing increasing signs of deterioration, most significantly a leaking ceiling. While it could be repaired, long-term maintenance would negate the short-term cost advantage of doing so. Thus, the option of a completely new building was brought under consideration.Le Bas, Natalie. \\"Manager supports new library for Birkenhead,\\" North Shore Times Advertiser, 28 Mar 2002, p. 28; In 2000, a feasibility study considered four options: demolition, refurbishment, ground floor extensions, or extensions to both levels. Demolition and reconstruction was estimated at $3.3 million, cheaper than extending both floors at $3.7m, though nearly twice the cost of refurbishment. The study noted that the site comprised five lots whose exact boundaries were unclear. It also acknowledged the demolition and reconstruction option would require a land use consent application, as the new building would exceed height and coverage restrictions.White & White Ltd. North Shore City Council Birkenhead building feasibility study. Tauranga: White & White Ltd, 2000, p. 3. In March 2002, City Librarian Geoff Chamberlain presented the study in a report to the council, with the first option being the preferred choice by the library services. It would increase the size of the building to 1600 m2, 1200 m2 of which would be devoted to the library itself, with the additional space being used for the Council Area Office and the Citizens Advice Bureau.Le Bas, Natalie. \\"Manager supports new library for Birkenhead,\\" North Shore Times Advertiser, 28 Mar 2002, p. 28. A year later, in June 2003, demolition and reconstruction was the confirmed preference. Costs were projected for the next year's draft annual plan. This included $100,000 in the first year for design and planning, $900,000 in the next, and $4.5 million for the building itself.\\"A new library on the books,\\" North Shore Times Advertiser, 19 Jun 2003, p. 1.

The project was then delayed, requiring a change to the district plan (see below). In late 2005, the Council Community Services General Manager, Loretta Burnett, stated: \\"There will be additional costs associated with a plan change but they are modest in comparison.\\" However, subsequent further delays lifted the cost to the region of $9.25 to $9.5 million as of the end of 2007, with a budget shortfall of $2.75 million.Report of a meeting of the Community Services & Parks Committee , North Shore City Council, 27, 28 Nov & 13 Dec 2007.  Resource consent issue  Footprint of the first version of the new library (blue line), in comparison to the old library and Plunket Society building. The North Shore City Council had lodged a resource consent application for the new building in December 2004, but did not wait for it to be confirmed before demolishing the existing building in May–June the next year. According to a 2006 examination of the project management, Council assumed there was little risk of the application being declined.White, Jean. \\"Report criticises library process,\\" North Shore Times, 16 Mar 2006, p. 3. However, an amended Council report by planner Ian Jefferis revealed that the building was to occupy 15% more of the reserve than expected (pictured).Reed, Kim. \\"Fears that Council breaching own rules,\\" North Shore Times, 30 Jun 2005, p. 1. Speaking after his appeal in 2007, Bill Abrahams, owner of Rawene Chambers located opposite the library site (pictured below), said that this lack of a consent was \\"the crux of the matter.\\" Some residents claimed they had not been properly consulted. Abrahams felt he should've been consulted because the design blocked his views. The Council disputed that there had been no consultation. The Strategic projects manager, Simon Guillemin, pointed out that there had been a number of public meetings and press releases. He also said there had also been consultation with the Birkenhead Town Centre Association and the Friends of the Library. Yet in June, independent commissioners declined resource consent. Reasons cited included concern about the impact on the existing environment, traffic flow, and the building's proposed size, which violated the zoning requirements.Reed, Kim. \\"Library plans thrown out,'\\" North Shore Times, 12 Jul 2005, p. 1.

As Geoff Chamberlain, the City Librarian acknowledged, the original zoning on the site was historically complex, and never tidied up. In fact, it limited the coverage of any building to only 10% of the land; but the original building built in 1968 had covered 19.5%.Scott, Clyde. \\"Letter to editor: Leave reserve,\\" North Shore Times, 18 Aug 2005, p. 6.

In addition to issues with the new library itself, the Council's performance was questioned, concern was raised about the drop-off in existing library services, and the library project was linked to the ongoing redevelopment in the whole of the Birkenhead town centre.A background article to indicate the timeframe of the then current Highbury redevelopment, of which Birkenhead Library is a part: North Shore City Council, \\"Unlocking Highbury's potential\\" , 29 Aug 2003.

Prominent among those objecting were former television newsreader Judy Bailey, and property developer, Graham Milne. Milne, who had made proposals as far back as 1989, proffered a wide variety of alternative plans for a far more elaborate community centre. These involved road closures, adding new roads, and leasing or selling his land on 15 and 17 Rawene Road, or going into partnership using his buildings. There was, however, little support for his ideas.Willis, Liz. \\"Library objector presents own plan,\\" North Shore Times, 4 Oct 2005, p. 2Lynch, Haley. \\"Library debate hots up,\\" North Shore Times, 11 Oct 2005, p. 2 In October 2005, he sent an email to Community Services & Parks Committee claiming his proposals had been misrepresented.

Their decision acknowledged the significance of historical precedent. In other words, the fact that there had been a library on the site for over thirty years was \\"notable\\" with regards to the usage the land was now put to. Also important was the appropriateness of the site in comparison to other options. Previous reports in 2003 and 2005 had considered the existing site was the best choice, while the Highbury Centre Plan of 2006 indicated that there had been extensive close consultation with the community over two years, which in a general sense was pertinent to the usage of the contested land. The commissioners concurred, and the library site became formalised as part of a Special Purpose 9 zone, which allows for the continued operation of community facilities. They noted too, that it is this zoning which underlies other North Shore Libraries, such as the ones at Takapuna and Glenfield. The commissioners also reconfigured the Recreation 2 boundary, to cut through the middle plot. This was done to safeguard the treed area, and to ensure a better balance between the reserve and the building complex. They emphasised the need for integration, both physical and visual, between the two zones to encourage usage of the recreation area.

Joan Foggin and John Wilson were the first paid staff, while Eleanor Fisher, already working in the library became the first full-time staff member in 1952. She remained the in-charge librarian until her retirement nineteen years later. By 1955 there was a part-time library assistant as well; and soon a fulltime junior was being considered. Growth in library use and opening hours continued, so that by 1968 there were 3 fulltimers and a part-timer to help on Friday nights. Staffing peaked in 1986 with 11.5 full time equivalents, and was subsequently reduced to 8.67.Graham, Rata. Birkenhead library: a history, Birkenhead: North Shore Libraries, p. 8. This includes staff spread over seven days, and reflects the high preponderance of part-timers typical of the industry. The decrease in staff occurred despite the onset of Sunday openings and the increase in door-count and issues because, at least in part, amalgamation allowed the centralisation of many departments, such as cataloguing.Graham, Rata.

The temporary location in the Leisure Centre, offered two tables in the magazine-newspaper-computer area, along with a few sofa chairs. The Children's section also had some seating (pictured). But, after pressure from Cr Hartley the children's play equipment was cut back by more than half.

Mobile library = Origins  Located in central Highbury the library is about seven miles (11 km) distant from the more remote areas of Beach Haven and Birkdale. As a consequence, from the mid-1960s there was a persistent call to establish a more convenient branch location. Petitioned by residents the Borough Council considered the possibility of setting up something in the Beach Haven hall on a temporary basis, to see if it would take. They asked the then Chief Librarian Ann Clegg to prepare a report looking into the details.\\"Library\\", North Shore Times Advertiser, 29 November 1977, p. 5.

In fact, as part of the Takapuna City Council in 1977 it had been contracted to visit the outer Birkenhead area once a week. This was reminiscent of the Country Library van, a national service which used to visit Birkenhead Library itself several times a year during an earlier era.  Years of service  With its purchase Birkenhead greatly expanded the mobile service. Capable of stocking up to 2000 items the van now went out five days a week with a full range of items from adult fiction, to magazines, picture books and puzzles, constantly reinvigorated from the main library. As well, it provided a community noticeboard. The van stopped at a different place each day, generally staying between 10am and 4:30pm, closing only for lunch and tea- breaks.\\"Library help for Birkenhead people,\\" North Shore Times Advertiser, 13 May 1982, p. 5. This was a length of time commensurate with weekend services. Within a few years though the more common practice was adopted of spending less time at a greater variety of locations. Initially there were two staff to cope with the influx of registrations, but the sole position was quickly established with Cynthia McKenzie as Birkenhead's first Mobile Librarian.[Mobile], North Shore Times Advertiser, 10 Jun 1982, p. 3.

Usage statistics  Published statistics extend to 2000, with most detail being recorded for the 1990s when Annual Reports were written for each branch. These statistics give an indication of usage of the library by a variety of measures including membership, issues (yearly and monthly), door count, stock size and number of reference queries.North Shore Libraries. Annual reports: 1990-2000, Takapuna, North Shore City Council. Note, when a figure for a year is cited this refers to a financial year \\"as at 31 March or 30 June.\\" (See Annual Report 1990/1991). Monthly figures were also collated into semesters (4 month periods), then quarters (3 month periods).  Membership  No statistical correlation has been done with population growth, though the latter has been cited generally in connection with library usage. Also there has been some records of membership numbers in and of themselves, as well as a proportion of the total population. So, for example, in 1971 there were 8,752 members of a borough population of 15,825. That this meant over half the population were members was duly noted.\\"Library in demand,\\" North Shore Times Advertiser, 15 Jun 1971, p. 22. However, by 1992 the population had increased to 31,860, while membership had only risen to 13,162. By 2003 there were 150 new registrations a month. Annual issues at Birkenhead Library 1950-2000.  Issues  From the library's inception issues have risen steadily with minor fluctuations, from a little over 8,000 items in 1950 to over 300,000 at the turn of the century (pictured). To date the peak recorded year of the published data has been 1998. In 1957 when issues dropped for the first time, this was attributed to the opening of the Northcote Library.\\"Decline in library book issues,\\" North Shore Times, 21 Nov 1956, p. 1. Similarly, while the Civic Reserve building was being constructed the library was relocated to a temporary shop site and the subsequent fall off in 1968 was attributed to this.\\"Fewer books issued at Birkenhead,\\" North Shore Times Advertiser, 22 Feb 1968, p. 8. Other trends visible from the graph include a dip in the 1970s and a rise in the 1990s. Data on the impact of the shift to the Leisure Centre has not been made publicly available yet. Over its decade of existence the Birkenhead Mobile Library issued nearly 15,000 items a year. At one point, 1984, 24,128 items, equivalent to more than 10% of the building's issue; though on average about half that. On the other hand, Birkenhead as a subset of the whole North Shore Libraries system, has averaged 16% of the total issues.Figures derived from tables in North Shore Libraries.

A left-handed bowler, and useful lower-order batsman, Willsher played first-class cricket for Kent County Cricket Club between 1850 and 1875. He took over 1,300 first-class wickets, despite only having one lung. He led a tour of Canada and the United States in 1868, and after retiring from his playing career became an umpire (cricket). Career=Early years Willsher was born at Little Halden Farm, in Rolvenden, Kent. His older brother, senior by over ten years, William Willsher, would go on to have an inauspicious career with Kent three years before Edgar's own debut when, in 1847, he appeared in one first-class match, scoring a pair at number eleven and not bowling. Edgar Willsher made his own debut on 11 July 1850 at the Kennington Oval against Surrey. He took four wickets in Surrey's first innings, but was not required to bat again as Kent were dismissed successively for 52 and 84 when following on after Surrey's 248. Willsher waited over a year for his next game, against the All England Eleven on 24 July 1851. This time Kent secured a draw, with Willsher taking four wickets in a match truncated by rain. He played only one other game in 1851, finishing the season with only eleven wickets though they were taken at an economical 17.50 runs per wicket. He gradually became a more regular feature of the Kent side from 1853, with thirty-nine appearances over the next four years. He took thirty- two wickets in 1854, including a then career-best 7/22. He then passed fifty wickets in the season for the first time during the 1856 season, taking 66 in total at 10.76 runs per wicket from only eight games. This included four ten- wicket match hauls. He then bettered his efforts with 71 wickets from ten games in 1857, though could only take 29 scalps in 1858 playing only six games. Seventy-nine wickets in 1859, and one better in 1860 established Willsher as a key bowler for Kent, as he regularly featured in their starting XI with fourteen games in each season. The 1860 season also saw his career- best innings figures of 8/16, as well as his first noted successes with the bat, scoring his maiden half century, one of four for the season. Fifteen more games in 1861 yielded another career-best 87 wickets in the season, and his second eight-wicket haul. Overarm bowling By the early 1860s, roundarm had replaced underarm as the standard form of bowling but overarm was still illegal, even though it was in use. Laws were modified in 1845 in an attempt to limit the ever increasing height of the bowler's arm. On 26 August 1862 at The Oval, Willsher became the first cricketer to be no-balled for bowling overarm. Playing for an England XI against Surrey he was called six times by umpire John Lillywhite for delivering the ball with his hand above his shoulder. Willsher left the field with eight of his professional colleagues (the two amateurs in the England team remained on the field) and play was abandoned for the rest of the day. When Lillywhite refused to accept the legality of Willsher's action, he was replaced as umpire so that the game could continue. Willsher went on to take 6 for 49. As a result of this incident, which may well have been planned in advance to force the issue, the laws were changed and overarm was legalised from the beginning of the 1864 season. Meanwhile, the 1863 season saw another 80 wickets for Willsher, as well as 494 runs with the bat, including three half-centuries. The runs scored during the season, and his highest score of 89, would remain his career best. Later career 1864 saw more success for Willsher in the County Championship with 79 more wickets at 13.84 runs each, though he failed to pass 50 with the bat. Though he then struggled with only 47 wickets in 1865, he remained consistent with 52 scalps in 1866 and 51 more in the following season, though again failing with the bat with a best over both years of 46. The 1868 season, however was the best of Willsher’s career with the ball, taking in a hot and dry summer 113 wickets at only 9.98 runs per wicket, the second occasion - and one of only three in his entire career - where Willsher’s season average was under 10.00.This was last achieved by a regular bowler when Alfred Shaw in 1880 took 186 wickets for 1589 runs This included twelve five-wicket hauls, and six ten-wicket hauls, both career-best performances. Though once again struggling with the bat, scoring 246 runs at 10.69, Willsher’s 113 wickets was second in the list of wicket-takers for the 1868 season, behind only future Test player James Southerton, and Willsher's average easily out-performed Southerton's 13.76. Willsher enjoyed successes in 1869 and 1870, with 64 and 84 wickets respectively, and took 70 more wickets in 1871; however Willsher, by then forty-two years of age, began to enjoy fewer returns for his bowling. From 1872 until retirement in 1875 he never bettered 35 wickets in a season, though he averages remained strong and his five-wicket hauls consistent. His appearances for Kent began to diminish, and in 1874 he played only seven matches, not passing fifty with the bat after 1869, and taking only two ten-wicket hauls in his final four seasons compared to thirteen in the proceeding four. Willsher played only two games in the 1875 season. The first, on 17 June against Hampshire, saw Willsher take four wickets in a convincing Kent innings victory, It was his final appearance for his county. In the last game of his first-class career on 19 August between two invitation XI's representing the North and South of the country, Willsher, playing alongside WG Grace, made only one run and was not called on to bowl.

Sommers hosted the overnight show from Cincinnati, Ohio-based clear-channel station WLW from 1984 to 2004, and it was carried by a small network of similarly high-powered stations across the United States. Sommers discontinued playing music on his nightly show, focusing on general and truck news, and talk from his listeners. Sommers announced his retirement from radio in 2004, but XM Satellite Radio was successful in getting him to do an afternoon truck show, which aired on Sirius Satellite Radio and XM from 4 PM to 7 PM Eastern time. Sommers retired from XM/Sirius on June 21, 2012, only to return for the last time on July 16, 2012. Biography=History Born Glen Council in Humboldt, Tennessee, Sommers moved to Cincinnati with his family at the age of 15. The next year (1959), be began working for WAEF. Sommers worked for other local radio stations in Cincinnati, as well as in Evansville, Indianapolis, Seattle, San Diego, Miami, and Kansas City, before settling back at WLW in 1984. His nickname \\"The Truckin' Bozo\\" reportedly came from his former boss at WLW, Randy Michaels. During a station remodeling, Michaels saw Sommers kick a wall. Unfortunately, its supports had been removed and it came crashing down across a desk, prompting Michaels to call Sommers “a bozo.” Sommers retired from WLW in 2003 but shortly thereafter assumed work at XM, joining the Open Road channel in a daytime slot. Sommers would remain with the channel through its merger with Sirius's Road Dog Trucking channel up until shortly before his death. Catching a robber \\"The Bozo\\" made national headlines when he helped to catch a robber at a convenience store in Camilla, Georgia. Sommers was talking live on the air with regular caller Linda Driskill, known as \\"Mississippi Lady\\" to listeners, when he heard Driskill admonish someone not to come behind her counter. She then hung up the phone. Sommers was concerned for her safety, so he called the Camilla police (who knew Driskill from Sommers' show). The police responded to Driskill's store and quickly apprehended the robber. Comments on Mexicans Sommers has raised some controversy among Mexican truckers for his apparent negative comments on the radio regarding cross-border trucking. He was often heard supporting bans on Mexican trucks in the United States. Family and health Sommers was married to Sharon \\"Lumpy\\" Cox Sommers for 35 years. Sharon ran a travel agency until May 2004 and retired from the travel business. She died Aug. 10, 2016, at her home in Mason, Ohio. \\"Sharon 'Lumpy' Sommers dies unexpectedly\\" Land Line Magazine, Aug. 11, 2016.Dale and Sharon spent approximately nine months a year in Florida and the summer months in Cincinnati. Sommers had a studio in his Florida home and also in his Cincinnati home so he could continue working from both locations. Sommers is survived by his sons Steve Sommers (born c. 1965; host of America's Trucking Network), media executive Sean Compton, David Sommers (who runs the travel business founded by his mother), Kevin Sommers, and Jason Sommers, stepson Brian Mitchell, and his daughter, Krissie Sommers Kastle who currently resides in Indiana. He had 19 grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. In later years, Sommers was diagnosed with Addison's disease and insulin-dependent diabetes, which factored into his retirement from terrestrial radio. Despite his health difficulties, he maintained his satellite radio show until shortly before his death. Death On the morning of August 24, 2012, Sommers died in a hospice facility near his home in Hernando, Florida at the age of 68.

Banal nationalism refers to the everyday representations of the nation which build a shared sense of national belonging amongst humans, a sense of tribalism through national identity. The term is derived from English academic, Michael Billig's 1995 book of the same name and is intended to be understood critically. Billig's book has been described as 'the fourth most cited work on nationalism ever published'. Michael Skey and Marco Antonsich, Everyday Nationhood: theorising culture, identity and belonging after Banal Nationalism. 2017, London: Palgrave Macmillan, p. 1. Billig devised the concept of 'banal nationalism' to highlight the routine and often unnoticed ways that established nation-states are reproduced from day to day. The concept has been highly influential, particularly within the discipline of political geography, with continued academic interest since the book's publication in the 1995. Today the term is used primarily in academic discussion of identity formation, geopolitics, and the nature of nationalism in contemporary political culture. Sophie Duchesne 'Who's afraid of Banal Nationalism', Nations and Nationalism, 2018, 24, 841-856. Examples of banal nationalism include the use of flags in everyday contexts, sporting events, national songs, symbols on money, popular expressions and turns of phrase, patriotic clubs, the use of implied togetherness in the national press, for example, the use of terms such as the prime minister, the weather, our team, and divisions into \\"domestic\\" and \\"international\\" news. Many of these symbols are most effective because of their constant repetition, and almost subliminal nature. Banal nationalism is often created via state institutions such as schools. Michael Billig's primary purpose in coining the term was to clearly differentiate everyday, endemic nationalism from extremist variants. He argued that the academic and journalistic focus on extreme nationalists, independence movements, and xenophobes in the 1980s and 1990s obscured the strength of contemporary nationalism, by implying that nationalism was a fringe ideology rather than a dominant theme in contemporary political culture. Billig noted the almost unspoken assumption of the utmost importance of the nation in political discourse of the time, for example in the calls to protect Kuwait during the 1991 Gulf War, or the Falkland Islands in 1982. He argues that the \\"hidden\\" nature of modern nationalism makes it a very powerful ideology, partially because it remains largely unexamined and unchallenged, yet remains the basis for powerful political movements, and most political violence in the world today. Banal nationalism should not be thought of as a weak form of nationalism, but the basis for \\"dangerous nationalisms\\" However, in earlier times calls to the \\"nation\\" were not as important, when religion, monarchy or family might have been invoked more successfully to mobilize action. He also uses the concept to dispute post-modernist claims that the nation-state is in decline, noting particularly the continued hegemonic power of American nationalism.

The airport is from the town centre. The airport opened on the 15 July 2004, and is capable of handling 250,000 passengers per year. It is able to handle large turboprop aircraft such as the Fokker F50 and the ATR 72-500. In 2008, the airport handled 49,181 passengers, 2,112 aircraft movements and of cargo. History The old Limbang STOL (Short Take Off and Landing) airfield was built in 1963 by the British Army for use during the confrontation between Malaysia and Indonesia. Situated beside Mas Hill (Bukit Mas), about from the town of Limbang. The old airfield did not meet the safety requirements of ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization). Furthermore, the old airfield was surrounded by mountains and the approach path was covered by tall vegetation such as trees, combined with the relatively high ground. This makes it particularly hazardous and difficult for civilian aircraft to operate safely into and out of the airfield. In 1978, a consultant firm was appointed to select a new site for a completely new airport and thus proceeded with the Master Plan Study regarding the layout of the new airport. The development plan of the new airport back then is to accommodate the Fokker F27 turboprop aircraft operation in the beginning and thereafter Boeing 737-200 jet aircraft operation. After lengthy delays, the new Limbang Airport project started in the year 2000 and was completed in only four years. The airport was officially opened on 7 April 2004, and full operational use followed on 15 April 2004. The new runway is long and is well suited to accommodate de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter, Fokker 50 and ATR 72-500 turboprop aircraft. The new airport is located about north west of the town of Limbang. Currently, Malaysia Airlines' subsidiary MASWings operates into and out of the airport. Other operators include Medevac and logging helicopters, and private turboprop powered aircraft.

To date, he has written more than 100 plays that have been staged all over the world, including Singapore, Melbourne, Glasgow, Birmingham, Cairo and London. Sharma has a BA from the National University of Singapore as well as an MA in Playwriting from the University of Birmingham, obtained in 1994 on a Shell-NAC Scholarship. He has also been awarded fellowships and grants by the British Council and the United States Information Service, and was conferred the Young Artist Award in 1997. His play, Still Building, was awarded a Merit Singapore Literature Prize in 1993 while Off Centre was selected by the Ministry of Education as a Literature text for 'N’ and 'O’ levels, and republished by The Necessary Stage in 2006. In 2014, Sharma was awarded the prestigious S.E.A. Write Award. In 2015, he was awarded the Cultural Medallion. In August 2007, a new volume of Interlogue: Studies in Singapore Literature, was published with a focus on the works of Haresh Sharma. Interlogue is a series published by Ethos Books and edited by A/P Kirpal Singh that aims to bring critical focus on the works of Singapore writers in English. Previous editions of the series included one each on fiction, poetry, drama and interviews with local writers, as well as one dedicated volume on Singapore playwright Robert Yeo. The publication, written by Prof David Birch and edited by A/P Kirpal Singh, was an extensive investigation into Sharma's development as a writer; the themes and issues he grapples with; as well as his vision and practice of theatre within and outside his work at The Necessary Stage. While Interlogue itself was not published by The Necessary Stage, the company assisted with the provision of archival material for Prof Birch's research. In 2010, The Necessary Stage published a new anthology of Haresh's plays entitled Trilogy, including the scripts and production notes of three award-winning works, Fundamentally Happy, Good People and Gemuk Girls. The script of Those Who Can't, Teach, which was restaged as part of the 2010 Singapore Arts Festival, was published by Epigram Books. In 2011, a collection of early short plays by Haresh Sharma entitled Shorts I was published by The Necessary Stage. In 2012, two collections of Sharma's scripts were published, one entitled Shorts 2, and the other entitled Plays for Schools. This was followed by the publication of a new collection of Sharma's plays on medical-related issues entitled Don't Forget to Remember Me in 2013, launched at the Singapore Writers Festival. In 2014, Sharma's play Best Of (staged four times to rave reviews in Singapore and Malaysia) and Eclipse (staged in both Singapore and Scotland) were published. Haresh Sharma also wrote the lyrics to Singapore's National Day Parade 2011's withdrawn \\"Fun Pack Song\\", which modified the lyrics of Lady Gaga's 'Bad Romance' to widespread criticism. In 2015, Fundamentally Happy was selected by The Business Times as one of the \\"finest plays in 50 years\\" alongside productions by Goh Poh Seng, Michael Chiang and Alfian Sa'at and others. Biography=Early life Born in Singapore, Sharma attended Tanjong Katong Secondary School, Temasek Junior College, as well as the National University of Singapore(Nus), where he majored in English Language and Literature. It was also at the National University of Singapore in 1987 where he met Alvin Tan, then a fellow undergraduate and founder of The Necessary Stage. He soon became involved in productions – first doing backstage, publicity, sound, and the occasional acting – then eventually moving on to scriptwriting when one of his plays won the NUS-Shell Short Play Competition in 1988.

He may have been related to the Christiana Benin who married into the Lundie family of Fife. Career Hugh chose an ecclesiastical career and by 1266, if not before, he was Chancellor of the diocese of Aberdeen.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 12. His career moved forward further in the early 1270s when, after the death of the previous bishop, the chapter and dean of Aberdeen elected him as the new Bishop of Aberdeen. The decree of election was relayed to the pope by Hugh's proctors Thomas de Benin, a likely brother or relative of Hugh and his successor as Chancellor, and Roger de Castello.Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, pp. 106-7; Keith, Historical Catalogue, p. 108; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 12.

Shortly after his return to Scotland he was made arbiter of a dispute about tithes between the clergy and the laity of the kingdom, and in a provincial council held at Perth was successful in effecting an arrangement of the difference. Bishop Hugh was one of the bishops of Scotland attending the Council of Lyons in 1274.Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, p. 107; Summerson, \\"Bennum, Hugh of (d. 1281/2)\\". Hugh was a trusted figure with both Pope Gregory and Pope Nicholas III, and was appointed several times to judge for the Pope the fitness of different Scottish bishops-elect.Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, p. 107. He was one of the most active of contemporary Scottish bishops, heading a provincial council at Perth, enjoying a good relationship with the Earl of Buchan, Alexander Comyn, and commencing new work on St Machar's Cathedral. He died early in 1282 on an island in lacus de Gowlis (Loch Goul, now called Bishops Loch) in the parish of New Machar), where the bishops had their lodging before the canonry was erected. According to Boethius, the bishop died of the cold (catarrho exundate subito interiit), according to another account he choked (suffocatus fuit), and still another by an ambush or to some other kind of treachery (insidiis occubuit).Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, pp. 107-8; Summerson, \\"Bennum, Hugh of (d. 1281/2)\\"; it may be the loch now called Bishop's Loch, see Dowden and also Keith, Historical Catalogue, p. 108.

Anding attended elementary and high school at the Ateneo de Manila University, before moving to the University of Arizona and then Arizona State University for his tertiary education. He graduated with a B.A. in Fine Arts and, not long after, attained his M.A. from Far Eastern University back in the Philippines.Panitikan.com He has since received honorary doctorates from Tokyo University, Baguio's St. Louis University, Polytechnic University of the Philippines, and the Ateneo de Manila University. Roces was a captain in the Marking’s Guerilla during World War II and a columnist in Philippine dailies such as the Manila Chronicle and the Manila Times. He was previously President of the Manila Bulletin and of the CAP College Foundation. In 2001, Roces was appointed as Chairman of the Movie and Television Review and Classification Board (MTRCB).

Literary works During his freshman year in the University of Arizona, Roces won Best Short Story for We Filipinos are Mild Drinkers. Another of his stories, My Brother’s Peculiar Chicken, was listed as Martha Foley’s Best American Stories among the most distinctive for years 1948 and 1951. Roces did not only focus on short stories alone, as he also published books such as Of Cocks and Kites (1959), Fiesta (1980), and Something to Crow About (2005). Of Cocks and Kites earned him the reputation as the country's best writer of humorous stories. It also contained the widely anthologized piece “My Brother’s Peculiar Chicken”. Fiesta, is a book of essays, featuring folk festivals such as Ermita's Bota Flores, Aklan's Ati-atihan, and Naga's Peñafrancia. Something to Crow About, on the other hand, is a collection of Roces’ short stories.

Green Spot is one of the few remaining bonded Irish whiskeys. Along with Mitchell's two older offerings, Yellow Spot and Red Spot, it is one of only three whiskeys specifically produced for and sold by an independent wine merchant in Ireland.  History  In 1805, William Mitchell established a bakery and confectionery business on Dublin's Grafton Street. In 1887, the business expanded into the wine and spirit trade at a location on nearby Kildare Street. At the time, it was common practice in Ireland for merchants to purchase distillate in bulk from whiskey distilleries and then mature it themselves in their own casks in bonded warehouses. The merchants had ample supplies of casks due to the importation of wine and fortified wines such as port and sherry. Therefore, it was a natural progression for Mitchell & Son to enter the bonded whiskey trade. Using distillate obtained from Jameson's nearby Bow Street Distillery, Mitchell & Son matured whiskey in a mix of casks that had been used to hold both dark and light sherries in their cellars under Fitzwilliam Lane in Dublin. For the first five years of maturation, half of the whiskey was aged in casks that had previously held Oloroso and other darker sherries, with the other half aged in casks that had held lighter finos. This combination prevented the darker wines from overpowering the whiskey. After five years, whiskeys from the respective light and dark sherry casks were then vatted together and allowed to mature for an additional five years in neutral oak. Mitchell & Son's whiskey was originally marketed as \\"Pat Whisky\\", with the labels featuring the logo of a man on a green background. However, in 1933, it was rebranded as \\"John Jameson & Son 10 Year Old Green Seal\\" and later became known simply as Green Spot. Mitchell & Son sold a range of whiskeys under the \\"Spot\\" brand. The name itself originated from Mitchell's practice of marking casks of different ages with a spot of colored paint. There was a 7-year-old Blue Spot, a 12-year-old Yellow Spot, and a 15-year-old Red Spot. However, it was the 10-year-old Green Spot that emerged as the company's most popular whiskey, and it was the only Spot whiskey to remain in continuous production until the present. Although it relaunched in 2012, Yellow Spot ceased bottling for decades in the late 1950s. According to posts on the Irish Whiskey Club's Facebook page in August 2018, Red Spot was re- introduced to the lineup in November 2018, again based on old family recipes from before it was discontinued 50 years prior. In 1971, Irish Distillers closed its Dublin distilleries (including Bow Street) and consolidated production in Midleton. As a result, the makeup of the whiskey was altered for the first time in known history. This change, coupled with low stocks of maturing whiskey, led Mitchell & Son to make an agreement with Irish Distillers to mature the whiskey onsite in Irish Distillers' own casks, with Mitchell & Son having sole rights to market, sell, and develop the whiskey.  Current production  Modern Green Spot is slightly younger than the original. Previously a 10-year-old whiskey, it is now a non-age statement whiskey, made from a blend of 7-10-year-old single pot still whiskeys that have matured in a combination of new and refill bourbon casks and sherry casks. Because Green Spot is produced in limited quantities (only 12,000 bottles per year) and was historically mainly sold through Mitchell's & Son's Dublin shop, it was previously difficult to obtain outside of Ireland. However, in recent years, distribution of Green Spot has become more widespread. For instance, it was launched in the United States for the first time in 2014 and is now available in retailers across France. In recent years, three special bottlings of Green Spot have been released: * Green Spot 10 Year Old, 40% ABV, batch of 1,000 bottles released to celebrate Mitchell & Son's 200th year in existence * Green Spot Château Léoville Barton, 46% ABV, regular Green Spot matured in sherry and bourbon casks but finished for up to 18 months in oaken Bordeaux wine casks from the Irish-owned Château Léoville-Barton * Green Spot Château Montelena, 46% ABV, matured in traditional sherry and bourbon casks and then finished for 12 months in French Oak Zinfandel wine casks from Château Montelena in the Napa Valley  Yellow Spot  Yellow Spot Whiskey In May 2012, Mitchell & Son re-introduced the Yellow Spot variant based on information in company archives. Bottling of Yellow Spot had previously ceased in the 1950s, but information in original company journals and ledgers allowed Mitchell & Son to determine the original Yellow Spot was a blend of 12-year- old pot still whiskeys that were matured in a combination of Malaga wine casks (which impart a slightly sweet taste), bourbon barrels, and sherry butts. Although Malaga-matured Irish pot still whiskey is a rarity in modern production, when Mitchell & Son checked Irish Distillers' inventory, it found a supply of 12-year-old Malaga-matured pot still whiskey. This allowed Mitchell & Son to re-launch Yellow Spot using the same style of whiskey that was contained in the original. When Mitchell & Son initially relaunched Yellow Spot, the plan was to produce limited batches of 500 cases per annum.  Red Spot  Red Spot was re-introduced to the lineup in November 2018, again based on old family recipes from before it was discontinued 50 years prior. This bottling is aged in bourbon barrels and sherry butts much like the other Spot Whiskeys, but with the addition of Marsala wine casks as well for a total of at least 15 years.http://www.spotwhiskey.com/en-EN/the-whiskeys/redspot  Accolades  Green Spot has received high scores at several international spirit ratings competitions. * Ultimate Spirits Challenge 2017 - 89 points. * International Spirits Challenge 2016 - Silver Award. * Beverage Tasting Institute 2016 - 91 points. * Ultimate Spirit Challenge 2016 - 95 points. * Green Spot Château Léoville Barton was awarded \\"Best single pot still whiskey\\" at the 2016 World Whiskies Awards. Notability The \\"Spot\\" range of whiskeys are amongst a handful of single pot still whiskeys in existence today, with Green Spot being the only one to have remained in continuous production since the early 1900s (Redbreast, the other long established Irish single pot still whiskey, briefly ceased production in the 1980s). Although once the most popular style of whiskey consumed in the world, pot still whiskey fell out of favor in the 20th century, due in part to the rise of cheaper, less intense blended whiskeys. As a result of declining demand, most Irish whiskeys were either reformulated as blends or discontinued. Single pot still whiskeys, which are historically unique to Ireland, are similar to single malts in that they are produced solely from pot still distillate. However, in contrast to malts that only use malted barley in the mash, single pot still whiskeys are produced from a mixed mash that contains both malted and unmalted barley.

At the helm He was elected to the West Bengal state assembly in 1967 and was minister, in charge of cottage and small-scale industries. However, he was really a party organization man. Majumdar rose sharply within the party. He was a member of the district secretariat in Howrah in 1968, a member of the state committee in 1982, general secretary of state unit of CITU in 1991 and finally general secretary at the national level in 2003. He was a member of the Rajya Sabha. As a CITU leader, he visited many countries, including the UK, Switzerland, Malaysia, France, Austria, North Korea, China and the then USSR. His opinions Speaking during the CPM central committee’s session at Kolkata in January 2007, which discussed land policy, Majumdar emphasized, \\"That policy only speaks of land for Special economic zones (SEZs). The party has so far not taken any decision on how to deal with land acquisition for other industries,’’ Majumdar had strong views on foreign direct investment (FDI). Stating that allowing FDI in the country is compromising India's own \\"self reliance\\", he said, \\"No country can develop on the basis of foreign investment alone.\\" He pointed out that an assessment should be made as to whether foreign investment is indeed beneficial to the country - in terms of employment and money generated - or just another way of international companies filling their deep pockets. On the eve of his joining the Rajya Sabha, he was asked whether it would send wrong signals to the industry, Majumdar said, \\"We are not here to liquidate industries. If our industrialists are sincere on growth, they need not get scared. In fact, this is a common phenomenon in advanced countries.\\" References Bengali politicians Politicians from Kolkata People from Dhaka District Majumdar.

It was aired on March 21, 2007, on ABC. The episode was written by Drew Goddard and Jeff Pinkner and directed by Jack Bender. The character of John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) is featured in the episode's flashbacks. Plot=Flashbacks After being abandoned by his girlfriend, Locke is suffering from depression and becomes a recluse. One day, a young man, Peter Talbot (Patrick J. Adams), comes to his door, and reveals Locke's father, con man Anthony Cooper (Kevin Tighe), is trying to marry his mother under a false name. Locke later goes to a florist shop where his father goes with Peter's mother. Knowing Cooper only wants to marry the woman to take her money, Locke confronts him and warns Cooper to call off the wedding and end it or he will tell the woman the truth. Cooper reluctantly agrees. Later, Locke is approached by two detectives, who tell him Peter is dead. Realizing that Peter's death was staged by Cooper, Locke goes to Cooper's condo and confronts him, but Cooper denies any involvement. He says Peter's mother was devastated and called off the wedding, and assures Locke that he can call Peter's mother himself if he wants proof. Locke picks up the phone to call her when Cooper suddenly charges him and shoves him through the window. Locke plummets eight stories to the ground, but survives. As Locke lies in a hospital bed, the two detectives inform him that his father has fled to Mexico and has now disappeared. They leave as a physiotherapist lifts Locke out of bed and places him in his wheelchair for the first time. On the Island Outside the Others' compound, Locke, Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews), Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) and Danielle Rousseau (Mira Furlan) are shocked to see Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) interacting familiarly with the Others, and Kate insists that the Others have done something to him. As Rousseau slips away, they sneak into the compound. Kate enters Jack's house and despite her insistence that she will not leave without him, he refuses to go. The door bursts open and two armed Others apprehend her, bringing along a struggling Sayid. Meanwhile, Locke enters the house of Ben Linus (Michael Emerson). Locke wakes Ben and threatens him, demanding he reveal the location of the submarine. They are interrupted — first by Ben's teenage daughter Alex (Tania Raymonde), whom Locke grabs and hides with in the closet, and then by Tom (M.C. Gainey) and an unseen Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell), who tells Ben that they captured Kate and Sayid trying to rescue Jack. Ben tells Tom to separate the two and interrogate them, and instructs Richard to bring him \\"the man from Tallahassee.\\" After the two leave, Locke asks Alex to get Sayid's pack, and Ben concludes he is doing so to destroy the Others' submarine. Jack visits the imprisoned Kate to tell her that he made a deal with the Others to let him go home. Alex gets Sayid's pack from him. As she leads Locke to the submarine — not knowing her mother is watching her from the bushes — Alex tells Locke that Ben is manipulating him, because he manipulates everyone. After Jack confronts Ben, demanding his friends be released after he leaves the island, Jack and Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) are escorted to the dock. They run into Locke as he is walking back up the dock. Jack asks what he's doing there; Locke simply replies \\"I'm sorry\\" as the submarine explodes behind him. Later, Locke is locked in a room in the DHARMA barracks. Ben and Richard open the door, and Locke reveals that he knows Ben wanted him to blow up the sub. Ben reveals that he wanted to find a way to keep Jack from leaving the island, but did not know how to; Locke had solved this problem. Ben and Richard lead Locke down a hallway, and Ben tells him that, for whatever reason, Locke is \\"in communion\\" with the island, and that makes him \\"very, very important.\\" Ben then takes Locke to a room where his father, Anthony Cooper (Kevin Tighe), is being held captive. Production Exposé can be heard on the TV Locke watches in his apartment. During the last flashback, you can see Anthony Cooper serving a bottle of MacCutcheon 60 Whisky to Locke, the same type used by Mr. Widmore (Penelope's father) and Desmond, Charlie and Hurley in 'Flashes Before Your Eyes', and Sayid in 'He's Our You' For the scene where Locke is thrown out the window, the footage of Terry O'Quinn ended when Locke is behind a pillar. Afterwards it is a stunt double, who also crashed through a fake window. The aerial scene of Locke falling had the same double falling attached to a harness in front of a bluescreen. The submarine was mostly a prop made of painted styrofoam over a steel structure, but its interior was shot inside the SS-287 at the USS Arizona Memorial. Awards Terry O'Quinn submitted this episode for consideration for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for the 59th Primetime Emmy Awards, an award he would go on to win. It was also sent for consideration for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series.

Like a weed, a cult is something that is growing in the wrong place. We would want to ask 'wrong' for who, and whether it might sometimes be right for us. We have no desire to line up with the psychological establishment to rule out of the debate those who offer something valuable to anti-racist, feminist or working-class practice.\\"  The report and the FBI  The report also figured in a 1993 lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York by Fulani and Newman against the FBI and Janet Reno.Federal Lawsuit , filed in the United States District Court, Southern District of New York, New Alliance Party, Fred Newman, Lenora Fulani, Rafael Mendez, v.

In her ruling on the case, Federal judge Constance Baker Motley ruled that the \\"political cult\\" charge \\"could not be directly traced to the 1988 FBI investigation\\", and that \\"any stigmatization which NAP suffers could be traced to a myriad of statements and publications made by private individuals and organizations, many of which preceded the FBI investigation.New Alliance Party vs. Federal Bureau of Investigation, 93 CIV 3490 (1993) Berlet, while upholding the charge of cultism, was critical of the FBI, noting that FBI characterizations were \\"not a protection of civil liberties but a smear of a group.\\" Washington City Paper reporter Kelvyn Anderson wrote at the time that the FBI investigation \\"sends a chilling political message: Groups outside of the political norm operate at their own risk and should expect state-sanctioned surveillance and intrusion into their affairs.\\"Anderson, Kelvyn.

It is a country music formatted station owned by iHeartMedia, Inc.. History KKSY-FM signed on February 27, 1963, as WMT-FM at 96.5 FM with an easy listening, jazz and classical music format. There were 90-minute classical music segments in the morning and evening with regular programs of jazz and music from Broadway musicals. Some of those early announcers were Keith Webster, Bill Dutcher, Don John Ross, Bill Grubbe, and Jim Wicks as well as other WMT announcers who took the helm of hosting on FM. In the early days, programming was totally separate from WMT radio but in the late 1960s, WMT-FM started simulcasting the 15-minute newscasts of WMT AM 600 several times a day. In the 1970s, it became a full-time \\"beautiful music\\" station before adopting an adult contemporary format in the early 1980s in an era when many beautiful music stations went to a soft rock or more contemporary format. WMT-FM's studios have been located at Broadcast Park on Collins Road in Cedar Rapids, along with its AM sister station WMT and TV station KGAN (the former WMT-TV), since it signed on. Until the 1970s, the studios of WMT radio was located on the fifth floor of the historic Paramount Theater building in downtown Cedar Rapids. It was one of the few stations with a callsign beginning with W located west of the Mississippi River. The station was known for their \\"time warp weekends\\" and long-standing tradition of being heavily involved in the Cedar Rapids community. The station hosts \\"Uptown Friday Nights\\" every Friday night in downtown Cedar Rapids. The station often joins up with WMT for special promotional events, and simulcasts during severe weather conditions. WMT-FM ended its longtime hot adult contemporary format on December 27, 2011, when Clear Channel transferred the country format from KKSY (95.7 FM); after a temporary simulcast period, 95.7 FM began to simulcast WMT on January 2, 2012 and eventually took the KWMG call letters on January 17, 2012.

Early life Arnesen grew up in Bærum, Norway on the outskirts of Oslo where at an early age, her parents immersed her in their passions: cross-country skiing and polar history. At an early age, Arnesen acquired her taste for the great wide open spaces while spending winters and Easter holidays in the Norwegian mountains.. Her love of athletics and the outdoors eventually led Arnesen to compete in orienteering and cross-country skiing, as well as to coach high school students in advanced-level cross-country skiing. At the age of 9, Liv read about Roald Amundsen’s expedition to the South Pole.

Roosevelt (FDR), during the Great Depression. The UP tax was a revenue program for FDR's New Deal. The act was controversial even within FDR's United States Treasury Department, as some economists such as Alfred G. Buehler thought that it would harm the ability of business to put capital towards company growth. In particular, Buehler reasoned that the UP tax would hit small business especially hard, as smaller businesses have fewer options in raising capital than large ones, usually by keeping a percentage of their profits for re-investment back into the business. The UP Tax was part of FDR's \\"Second New Deal\\". The bill established the principle that retained corporate earnings could be taxed. The idea was to force businesses to distribute profits in dividend and wages, instead of saving or reinvesting them. In the end, Congress watered down the bill, setting the tax rates at 7 to 27% and largely exempting small enterprises.David M. Kennedy, Freedom From Fear, The American People in Depression and War 1929 – 1945, Oxford University Press, 1999, , p. 280 Conservative critics of the New Deal considered this a burden on business growth. Facing widespread and fierce criticism, the tax was reduced to 2½ percent in 1938 and completely eliminated in 1939.Benjamin Graham. Security Analysis: The Classic 1940 Edition.

The intrepid field researcher explored Wyoming's countryside for most of her adult life, seeking to document a fast-disappearing frontier. Grace Raymond Hebard (July 2, 1861 – October 1936) gained prominence as a Wyoming historian, suffragist, pioneering scholar, prolific writer, political economist and noted University of Wyoming educator. Hebard's standing as a historian in part rose from her years trekking Wyoming's high plains and mountains seeking first-hand accounts of Wyoming's early pioneers. Today her books on Wyoming history are sometimes challenged due to Hebard's tendency to romanticize the Old West, spurring questions regarding accuracy of her research findings. In particular, her conclusion after decades of field research that Sacajawea (participant in the Lewis and Clark Expedition) was buried in Wyoming's Wind River Indian Reservation is called into question.\\"Sacajawea legend may not be correct,\\" by Sandy Mickelson. The Messenger; Fort Dodge, Iowa. The reporter recounts the findings from \\"Also Called Sacajawea: Chief Woman's Stolen Identity,\\" by Thomas H. Johnson. Johnson argues that Hebard had the wrong woman when she relied upon oral history that an old woman who died and is buried on the Wyoming Wind River Reservation was Sacajawea, the Shoshone woman who participated in the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Other research claims that instead, Sacajawea is buried at Fort Manuel on South Dakota's Standing Rock Indian Reservation. Hebard also served as the first female on the University of Wyoming Board of Trustees, where she exercised authority over the university finances, its president, and faculty.\\"Wyoming University: The First 100 Years, 1886-1986,\\" by Deborah Hardy. University of Wyoming, 1986. Her University of Wyoming role extended to establishing the university's first library. Moreover, Hebard served as a professor for 28 years. Hebard was also the first woman admitted to the Wyoming State Bar Association (1898);American Women Historians, 1700s - 1990s; by Jennifer Scanlon, Shaaron admitted to practice before the Wyoming Supreme Court (1914); and appointed by her peers as vice president of the National Society of Women Lawyers. She was active in Wyoming political life, giving speeches, organizing historical associations, conducting citizenship classes for immigrants, participating in the local and national suffragist movement, lobbying for child-welfare laws, serving as a Red Cross volunteer, and selling war bonds during World War I. Background Alice Louise Reynolds, Amy Brown Lyman, Grace Raymond Hebard, Mrs. Weston Vernon, Ruth Moench Bell Susa Young Gates Grace Hebard was born in the Mississippi river town of Clinton, Iowa, on July 2, 1861, to Rev. George Diah Alonzo Hebard (1831–1870) and Margaret E. Dominick Hebard (Marven). Her family soon moved to Iowa City where her father, a missionary and a later territorial legislator, built a new Presbyterian church. Hebard took her B.S. in what is now civil engineering at the University of Iowa in 1882. She was a member of Pi Beta Phi Women's Fraternity. Hebard became the first woman to \\"be graduated from the Civil Engineering Dep(artment) of the University,\\" according to documents at the University of Iowa Library. In later years, Hebard reflected in a 1928 letter to a colleague on her singular experience as a female engineering student: \\"I met with many discouragements and many sneers and much opposition to my enrolling in the scientific course, which was then entirely a man's college. ... All kinds of discouraging predictions were made that I would fail, that it was impossible or a woman to do the kind of work I was undertaking.\\"\\"Grace Raymond Hebard: The Independent and Feminine Life; 1861-1936,\\" by Virginia Scharff. From \\"Lone Voyagers: Academic Women in Coeducational Universities. 1870 - 1937.\\" Edited by Geraldine Joncich Clifford. The Feminist Press at the City University of New York. New York 1989. Scharff's claim that Hebard's historical accounts were short on hard evidence is contradicted by the record that shows that Hebard conducted extensive field research and gathered and transcribed oral history for her book on Sacajawea. Hebard's body of evidence also includes citations gleaned from conducting international archive searches. Hebard later resumed her studies by correspondence and earned an M.A. from the University of Iowa in 1885. Finally, again by correspondence, she received her Ph.D. in political science from Illinois Wesleyan University in 1893. Hebard made her way west in 1882 to Cheyenne, eight years before Wyoming became a state in 1890. Hebard arrived at the future capital city in the company of her mother and brothers; Fred, Lockwood, and her sister, Alice. She became part of the social scene with other young people at the newly constructed Cheyenne Club, where cattle barons, often wealthy Europeans, held sway over Cheyenne. Yet general violence and roughness were still common. Rowdy cowhands wearing guns in the saloons and prostitutes openly plying their trade in brothels made for a sometimes raucous downtown.\\"The Wyoming Lynching of Cattle Kate: 1889,\\" by George W. Hufsmith. High Plains Press, Glendo, Wyo.; 1993. Citizens were known to hand out their own form of retribution, however, if things got out of hand. For example, in 1883 a crowd lynched an accused murderer, leaving him hanging from a Cheyenne telephone pole. Hebard's college education distinguished her from such local citizens. The young engineer found work at the surveyor general's office, where she served as the only female draftsman in the city, according to the University of Wyoming archives. Hebard rose to the position of deputy state engineer, reporting at first to Elwood Mead. Mead made his mark drafting Wyoming Territory water laws and later as head of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation.\\"Twenty Thousand Roads,\\" by Virginia Scharff. University of California Press, 2003. Yet engineering was not to be Hebard's calling. Instead, after nine years in Cheyenne, she left her family and ventured 50 miles west across a boulder-strewn mountain range to the railroad town of Laramie. This small town in Southeastern Wyoming, which began as a tent city mid-1860s, was home to a fledgling university when Hebard arrived in 1891. Laramie's scruffy prairie campus became the locale from which Hebard launched a storied career in higher education, devoting more than 45 years (1891–1936) to the University of Wyoming. University trustee The University of Wyoming in 1908, some 17 years after Hebard's arrival, remained an isolated campus adjoining the prairie on the eastern edge of Laramie. In 1891 Grace Hebard parlayed the recommendation of Republican U.S. Senator Joseph M. Carey of Cheyenne, whom she had known since childhood into an appointment by acting Governor Amos Barber as a salaried secretary to and member of the University of Wyoming Board of Trustees. The 30-year-old woman found herself in uncharted territory as she navigated the male-dominated world of university governance. She soon learned that her administrative journey through the halls of higher education would not be without hazards. Yet from the beginning, Hebard wielded her position as trustee with considerable force, serving until 1903 but continuing as secretary until 1908. Hebard dominated the university administration for 17 years, exercising \\"all pervasive\\" influence. She administered from a position of strength, ranging from setting university policy to managing its finances. Hebard directed the university's finances with near independence, excluding an annual review, from any administrative oversight of the daily expenditures she authorized. Hebard later remarked that \\"The Trustees gave me a great deal of power, and I used it.\\" The university struggled financially during the recession years of the mid-1890s. The six high schools in sparsely-populated Wyoming in 1894 could muster but eight graduates from which the university could seek to enroll freshman students. The under-funded university relied upon federal research grants to its Agricultural Experiment Station. The president of the board of trustees, with Hebard as secretary, chaired this important arm of the university. Hebard consolidated her position with the Agricultural Experiment Station, as she had with the trustees, into one of decision-making authority. The influence that Hebard exercised over the university finances, its president, and faculty was considerable. Rumors emerged that conflict with Hebard and her oversight of faculty appointments prompted President A. A. Johnson to resign. Her \\"iron rule\\" of campus invariably revolved around her authority over finances, including expenditures of federal grants. Questions about the use and perhaps misuse of federal funds arose, sparking increased scrutiny of the board of trustees, all of whom were Republicans. Democratic furor at the \\"Republican regime\\" played out in the local newspapers where 1907 charges of graft and partisan awarding of university printing contracts and improper expenditures of federal grants brought fierce criticism of Hebard's authority and domination, according to university historian Deborah Hardy. The state's Democratic press piled on. One sharply worded account claimed: \\"It's a standing remark in Laramie that no professor or employee of the institution can hold his job without being branded 'OK' by Miss Secretary Hebard, and whenever she decrees it the president's head will fall in the basket.\\" Yet despite the uproar, a governor-appointed investigative commission found \\"that there had been no interference by Miss Hebard.\\" Nonetheless, still under attack from the press and internally at the university, Hebard resigned as secretary to the trustees. The end of Hebard's university administrative career in 1908 marked the beginning a rich phase in her teaching, writing, and field research. In 1908, the same university board which had been under the harsh spotlight of public criticism during Hebard's tenure as trustee appointed her as full professor. Hebard held the post until she died 28 years later. Author Grace Hebard continued breaking new ground when she became the university's first librarian. Hebard assumed the role of librarian, without pay, beginning in 1894. She established a library from some \\"sacks of books\\" that she found in a small locked room at the university. Hebard received appointment as the university's first official librarian in 1908. Hebard continued serving as librarian until 1919. The catalogued collection of books had grown to 42,000 volumes by the end of her tenure. Hebard launched her formal career as a classroom teacher when she received an appointment in 1906 as the university's head of the Department of Political Economy. Hebard extended her academic activities to include serving on an advisory board for the Wyoming Historical Association. This affiliation helped point her towards her new research pursuit, spearheading trail marking in Wyoming for the Oregon Trail and other pioneer routes. Hebard's work included mapping old trails in Wyoming, particularly the Oregon Trail. However, she contributed more than cartography. Hebard began collecting historical documents and other materials regarding Wyoming history. Moreover, she traveled the state, seeking interviews with Old West pioneers and spent several summers among the Shoshone Indians of Wyoming. Prior to her death in 1936, Hebard bequeathed her collection to the University of Wyoming. Her papers characteristically included her own maps, publications, field books, and writings. Her often romanticized view of the Old West shaped the books that she wrote on Wyoming history. Hebard's published works include: *The Government of Wyoming (1904), *The Pathbreakers from River to Ocean (1911), *The Bozeman Trail (1922), co- author with E.A. Brinninstool (collaboration done entirely via correspondence) *Washakie (1930), *Sacajawea (1933) Illness and ultimately her death ended progress on what would have been Hebard's final book, an account of the Pony Express. Famed frontiersman and expeditionary photographer William Henry Jackson collaborated with Hebard as an illustrator in 1933 and 1934. He provided water colors and sketches for her unpublished manuscript.\\"Oregon Trailways,\\" by Randy C. Bunney. Thesis (M.A.)--University of Wyoming, 1993. Location: Coe Library.

Mythmaker The U.S. Census Bureau declared the western frontier closed in 1890, eight years after Grace Hebard's arrival in Cheyenne at 21 years of age. Yet for Grace Hebard, the grand sweep of the mythic West stretched wide open to interpretation, resulting in Hebard placing her research subjects in a \\"highly romanticized\\" West. Critics such as author Mike Mackey assert that \\"Hebard's 'histories' have resulted in many interpretations in Wyoming of past events which never took place, but are now believed by many in the state to be facts.\\" He adds that \\"Often when the facts did not support her thesis, Hebard made up her own 'facts.'\\" In particular, Hebard's 30 years of research which lead to the 1933 biography of the Shoshone woman who accompanied the Lewis and Clark Expedition is called into question by critics. Hebard presents a stout- hearted woman in a biography that is \\"undeniably long on romance and short on hard evidence, suffering from a sentimentalization of Indian culture\\". Hebard crafts a picture of Sacajawea as a restless spirit who wandered to Canada, Washington State, California, Arizona, Wyoming, and beyond. A person, according to testimony gathered by Hebard, so revered by the Whites that she rode stagecoaches for free and who \\"rendered great service both in urging the Shoshones to learn to farm ... and that the buffalo and other game animals would soon be gone.\\"\\"Sacajawea. A guide and interpreter of the Lewis and Clark expedition, with an account of the travels of Toussaint Charbonneau, and of Jean Baptiste, the expedition papoose,\\" by Grace Raymond Hebard. The Arthur H. Clark Company, 1933. If Sacajawea appears as a grand figure in Hebard's writings, so do Sacajawea's descendants. Consider for instance the heroic imagery Hebard uses in \\"Sacajawea\\" when she describes 90-year-old Maggie Bazil Large, whom Hebard contends was the granddaughter of Sacajawea. Hebard, without citing a source, recounts when Large reportedly attended the funeral of a person who was, according to Hebard, another descendant of Sacajawea. Hebard describes Large as a woman who \\"exhibited great energy in an emergency\\" when the ropes used to lower a coffin became fouled. Hebard further expands on the actions of the valiant Large: \\"An ancient, white-haired woman sprang forward, took the ropes in her own hands, and, bracing herself, successfully lowered the box to its resting place with a dexterity that challenged the skill of the young men present. She seems to have possessed something of the alertness, power to do, and energy of her grandmother [Sacajawea]. Hebard reveals the lens through which she viewed the subject of her research during a 1915 visit to Sacajawea's reported grave in isolated Central Wyoming: \\"In August, 1915, the author made a pilgrimage to the cemetery of the Wind river reservation for the purpose of paying humble tribute to Sacajawea. ... A well- beaten path from the wooden stile to Sacjawea's grave makes no guide post necessary. Annually thousands of people journey to this last resting place... .\\" In retrospect, Hebard's reputation as a historian is diminished by her reliance upon unsubstantiated oral histories she gathered from Native Americans as she \\"prosecuted her search for authentic historical material which would enable her to rescue Sacajawea from the semi-oblivion into which her name had fallen, and give to her legitimate place in the history of the great northwest.\\" However, the claim continues today that Hebard's research placing Sacajawea at the Wyoming Indian Reservation was largely one of mistaken identity. Nonetheless, Hebard stood firm regarding her Sacajawea findings. She held to her viewpoint that she had demonstrated, \\"beyond a question of doubt\\", the true identify of Sacajawea. Hebard had a final piece of evidence to present. About one year before her death in 1936 Hebard revealed a \\"secret\\" to her protégé Agnes Wright Spring that she asked Wright not to reveal until after Hebard's death. Hebard shared that the Indians had given her a name while doing research on the Wind River Indian Reservation. The Indians, Hebard said, had named her Zont-Tumah-Two-Wiper-Hinze, meaning: the good white woman, the woman with one tongue. \\"They [the Indians] felt, she said, that she was telling the truth about their Indian ancestor.\\" Hebard is still an important figure, according to historian Phil Roberts, despite shortcomings in her research. Roberts notes that Hebard \\"was conscious of the need to chronicle the history of Wyoming while many of the actors were still alive. Unfortunately, she was constrained by the same problems faced by today's historians. Without dependable source materials, one can make false assumptions that may not reflect the historical record.\\" Trail trekker The Wyoming Oregon Trail Commission, in close association with Grace Hebard and H.G. Nickerson, placed at least 31 markers throughout Wyoming between 1913–1915.Grace Hebard had a passion for marking, preserving, and commemorating the quickly disappearing frontier. She helped found organizations such as the Wyoming Oregon Trail Commission and participated in Wyoming Historical Association and the state chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution. As state historian for the D.A.R., she helped erect and dedicate historic markers in elaborate unveiling ceremonies at sites throughout Wyoming. Locations included iconic Oregon Trail landmarks, such as Fort Laramie and Independence Rock; as well as less known sites on the Bozeman Trail and the Pony Express route. Hebard was a tumbleweed of activity. Summers often found her bouncing along Wyoming's sagebrush rangeland, sometimes by horse and wagon and later by automobile, searching for Oregon Trail ruts or seeking to locate yet another historic site or pioneer to corner for an interview. Only after the High Plain's long winter had retreated would conditions become favorable for Hebard's expeditions. Although the record shows that she sometimes strapped on snowshoes to continue her explorations in the winter. But even summer treks presented difficulties. Thunder boomers easily turned the primitive tracks that then served as roads into impassable quagmires of Wyoming mud. Summer rains producing axle-deep mud were but part of the problem. She noted while marking the Oregon Trail in Western Wyoming with Civil War veteran and former bullwhacker H.G. Nickerson that she traveled: \\"...with a team [of horses] about 800 miles, consuming the warm months of the summer of 1913 and 1914, with much inconvenience and hardship, owing to the frequent rains storms, and often high winds, deep dust and the mosquitoes, the insects often driving us from the streams out in the hills or plains to camp, making camping in the open country very disagreeable.\\"\\"Marking the Oregon Trail, the Bozeman Road and Historic Places in Wyoming 1908-1920,\\" by Grace Raymond Hebard. Published by the Daughters of the American Revolution of Wyoming, no date. Hebard particularly recognized the efforts of Nickerson in Wyoming trail marking. Nickerson, who had lived in the South Pass area since 1868, by Victoria Lamont. Undated. Nickerson was a member of Wyoming's second territorial legislature. He ran against and lost to the author of Wyoming's suffrage amendment, William H. Bright, a saloon-keeper and miner. later became president of the Oregon Trail Commission of Wyoming. Hebard saluted his work locating and marking old western trails during a period of eight years noting that: \\"Here and there Captain Nickerson has placed stones, boulders and slabs of native material on which he, in the open, has carved with his chisels and mallet inscriptions and notations. Trail marking naturally often included remote locations. Yet Wyoming's isolated rangeland and mountain passes did not prevent trail boosters such as Hebard and the Daughters of the American Revolution from staging formal unveiling ceremonies with a pageantry of music and \\"religious, patriotic and historical exercises, prayer, national songs and addresses.\\" Stone markers placed by Nickerson, Ezra Meeker, Hebard, and others (some weighing several tons) are still found throughout Wyoming and are monuments to the state's early historic preservation efforts. Americanization Of all Grace Hebard's accomplishments, she reportedly valued her Americanization work as \\"perhaps most precious.\\" Scholar Frank Van Nuys notes that a Wyoming News testimonial expressed in 1935 that Dr. Hebard's \\"certificates of preparation for naturalization were accepted by the United States District Court in lieu of examinations for citizenship.\\" Van Nuys goes on to note: \\"That sort of clout suggests that Grace Hebard's Americanization enterprise beginning in 1916 deserves some scrutiny. While the evidence of her work is fragmentary, it nonetheless places Hebard within an essentially progressive tradition of qualified optimism about immigrants' ability to assimilate to Anglo-American cultural norms. by Frank Van Nuys. Undated. Hebard's indoctrination of new Americans came on the heels of the greatest wave of migrants to every enter the country.\\"American Realities: Historical Episodes from Reconstruction to the Present,\\" by J William T Youngs. Little, Brown and Company. Boston and Toronto 1987. Millions of new immigrants from Eastern and Southern Europe entered the United States, mostly through Ellis Island, from 1880 to 1915. New Americans, with their new languages, foods, and customs were not always welcome. One of the early targets where the Chinese who were locked out from immigrating to the U. S. by the Chinese Seclusion Act. This federal act passed in 1882 coincided with Hebard's arrival in Cheyenne. Hebard's progressive work with immigrants in Laramie would have been in stark contrast to the national tension between residents and immigrants. Such tension spurred the National Origins Act of 1924, which favored Northern European immigrants, but restricted East European Jews. Hebard's view of immigration from the High Plains of Wyoming would have been shaped by news that reached her while living in Cheyenne. On September 2, 1885, rioters killed at least 28 Chinese miners and wounded 15 in a violent labor dispute, since dubbed the \\"Rock Springs Massacre.\\" In Rock Springs (about 155 miles west of Cheyenne) the local newspaper endorsed the outcome of the riot, while other Wyoming newspapers, limited support to sympathy for the causes of the white miners.\\"History of Wyoming,\\" by T.A. Larson. Pg. 141–144. Hebard's activism placed her against the prevailing social and political winds that swept through Wyoming and the nation. The way Hebard lived her feminist life, including her deep relationship with fellow Professor Agnes M. Wergeland, spoke volumes about her worldview. Wergeland, like Hebard a feminist, was a trail breaker in her own right. The Norwegian immigrant was the first woman from her country to earn a Ph.D. Wergeland, who became a U.S. citizen in 1902, found in Hebard an ideal tutor for Americanization. Hebard noted: \\"Dr. Wergeland had never had a realistic conception of what absolute suffrage for women meant until she came to Wyoming, where women are not restricted in their right to vote in any way.\\" Suffragist National suffragists heralded Wyoming when on Dec. 10, 1869, territorial Gov. John A. Campbell signed the suffrage act into law. Suffragists were not so celebratory two years later when legislators seeking to repeal women's enfranchisement failed by a single vote, according to historian Phil Roberts. Roberts cites the late T.A. Larson's research that found suffrage detractors feared women voters would seek Sunday closing of saloons.accessdate=2008-08-15 work= Department of History, University of Wyoming Yet, Hebard in a 1920 interview with the New York Tribune failed to account for opposition to women's suffrage in Wyoming, noting: \\"I never before saw an anti-suffragist. You know, out in Wyoming we have had woman suffrage for fifty years, and there is no such thing as an anti-suffrage man in our state -- much less a woman.\\" Yet it was because of such anti-suffragists that Esther Hobart Morris made history for women in Wyoming in 1870 when she received an appointment as the nation's first female justice of the peace.accessdate=2009-02-04 work=Made in Wyoming, Our Legacy of Success. This educational website contains a variety of profiles of notable Wyoming residents. Morris' historic posting in South Pass City, a mining town in Central Wyoming, followed the previous justice resigning in protest of Wyoming's suffrage legislation. Hebard spent many years advancing a claim that can be traced back to her trail marking companion H.G. Nickerson that Morris was an instigator and co-author of that legislation. That claim is considered false by some recent researchers. Hebard and Nickerson erected a rock cairn monument in 1920 near Morris' South Pass City cabin as a crude memorial. A granite marker latter replaced the cairn with an inscription identifying Morris as co-author of Wyoming's suffrage bill. The Wyoming Division of State Park's and Historic Sites has tried to correct the record noting that \\"recent studies indicate that [William H.]Bright was the only author of the suffrage bill.\\"\\"Lies Across America: What our historic sites get wrong\\" by James W. Loewen. Simon and Schuster.2007. . Author Virginia Scharff reads more than imperfect history into Hebard's statements concerning Morris. Scharff sees Hebard's portrayal of Morris as a suffragist as being rendered \\"in her [Hebard's] own image.\\" Being the first of western territories or states to adopt women's suffrage placed Wyoming in the national spotlight. National suffragists in subsequent years found a potent symbol in Wyoming enfranchising women as states voted on the Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution granting suffrage to women. Carrie Chapman Catt, who was president of the National American Woman Suffrage Association, incorrectly claimed that Wyoming \\"gave so much evidence of positive good to the community arising from the votes of women that she became the direct cause of the establishment of woman suffrage in all of the surrounding states.\\" Larson challenged such broad generalization noting that there is \\"no short, simple, all-encompassing explanation for the West's priority in woman suffrage.\\" If support for social justice as the national suffragists claimed did not fully explain Wyoming's lead role in suffrage, what did? One factor was the prospect of free advertising that lawmakers expected to arise following the passage of the territorial suffrage bill, according to Larson. The reasoning ran that the national attention would attract settlers, especially women.\\"Origins of Women's Suffrage, by T.A. Larson.\\" \\"Essays in Western History in honor of T.A. Larson,\\" edited by Roger Daniels. University of Wyoming Publications. Laramie 1971. The record is unclear if Wyoming territorial adoption of suffrage influenced Hebard's decision to migrate to Wyoming in 1882. Just as suffragist found an ideal symbol in Wyoming for their campaign, so too did Catt and others laud the feminist role of Hebard. Suffragists were eager to \\"hold her up as an example of the finest type of American womanhood,\\" according to former Wyoming state historian Agnes Wright Spring. The fact that Hebard as a pathbreaker for women just happened to live in Laramie bolstered the credentials for her as a role model. For Laramie was home to the nation's first vote cast by a woman and where women first sat on a jury.\\"Women of the West,\\" by Dorothy Gray. University of Nebraska Press. Lincoln Nebraska. Both historic events took place in 1870, before Hebard had finished her studies in Iowa. Yet Hebard established her own standing as a suffragist when she petitioned the Wyoming constitutional convention to adopt a suffrage clause in advance of Wyoming entering the Union July 10, 1890. Moreover, national suffragists tapped Hebard to participate in the National American Woman Suffrage Association and later as a member of the Suffrage Emergency Brigade. The latter group lobbied Connecticut's governor for the state's legislature to become the 36th state to ratify the 19th Amendment. Subsequently, Hebard was among the select few who spoke at the 1920 suffragist celebration in Chicago following passage of the Nineteenth Amendment. Hebard's association with national suffragist leader Catt allowed Hebard to achieve an \\"academic coup d'etat\\" in 1921. Hebard teamed up with Professor June Downey to convince faculty members to award the University of Wyoming's first honorary degree to Carrie Chapman Catt. Catt came to Laramie to receive the university honor and to present the baccalaureate address. The imagery of Catt appearing in Laramie where women voters and jurists made history would not have been lost on the suffragists. In addition, Catt was at the forefront of a one-year anniversary celebration of the 19th Amendment later that summer in New York City. Catt, following the suffrage victory, turned her focus to the newly established League of Women Voters. Hebard telegraphed Catt at the headquarters of the National American Woman Suffrage Association: \\"Congratulations to you on this the first anniversary of the birth of national suffrage. I thank you for the Tennessee touchdown which scored victory.\\" Tennessee was the 36th state to pass the amendment, thus providing the needed number for national adoption of the suffrage amendment. Final days The Doctors' Inn Grace Hebard retired from teaching in 1931. Yet she continued to research and collect historical material in her Laramie home, known to students and colleagues as \\"The Doctors Inn\\". Hebard lived in this house that she had built with her friend, Agnes Wergeland, who died in 1914. Grace's sister Alice Marvin Hebard then lived there until her death in 1928. Hebard died in October 1936 at the age of 75. \\"To the time of death, she was a dominant -- and perhaps domineering -- figure on campus.\\" The University of Wyoming held a memorial program in her honor later that month. The influence and impact of Hebard's life in part can be measured by the attendees at her funeral and contributors to the 50-page \\"In Memoriam\\" program published by her fellow faculty. The memorial service had the trappings of a state funeral featuring testimonials from: *Mr. and Mrs. Bryant Butler Brooks, former Wyoming governor *Robert D. Carey, United States senator and former Wyoming governor *Carrie Chapman Catt, president of the National American Woman Suffrage Association and former president of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance *Frank Pierrepont Graves, president of the University of the State of New York; third University of Wyoming president *W. H. Jackson, pioneer photographer and former member of Hayden Geological Survey *Agnes Wright Spring, former Wyoming State Historian. Colorado State Historian. The written tributes and eulogies following Hebard's death that colleagues, students, and friends delivered were added to Hebard's personal papers. Those papers are part of an extensive collection of documents that still bear Hebard's name today. The collection includes an almost terse tribute by Carrie Chapman Catt that overlooks Hebard's contributions to national suffragism for women: \\"I shall miss Dr. Hebard more than words can say. My sympathy is extended to the University and all the Wyoming friends. She lived a great life.\\" Other contributors to the memorial program characteristically presented Hebard as a multi-faceted, action-driven feminist with a penchant for history and trail marking. Furthermore, Hebard garnered recognition as the first woman admitted to the Wyoming State Bar Association (1898) followed by her being admitted to practice before the Wyoming Supreme Court (1914). Hebard's peers also recognized her involvement in a variety of civic and public affairs, such as supporting American troops in World War I by selling war bonds and planting Victory Gardens. Moreover, she successfully spearheaded passage of a 1923 Wyoming child labor law. Youth, particularly University of Wyoming students, played a special role in Hebard's career, as noted by testimonials from fellow students, faculty, and citizens. The memorial service program included a statement by university President Crane, \\"Above all she was a friend to generations of students.\\" Similarly, an October 12, 1936, editorial in the student newspaper, the Branding Iron, noted: \\"In the death of Dr. Grace Raymond Hebard the students of the University have lost a friend.\\" Hebard furthered her legacy with students by funding a number of scholarships, including: *The Agnes Mathilde Wergeland Memorial History Scholarship *The Alice Marven Hebard Memorial Fund *Hebard Map Scholarship Fund Hebard and Wergeland plot in Greenhill Cemetery The intrepid Hebard is buried across the street from campus at the Greenhill Cemetery in Laramie in a plot near her sister and teacher, Alice, and Wergeland. A plaque memorializing Hebard is mounted on the famed Oregon Trail icon, Independence Rock; located in barren central Wyoming, about 50 miles southwest of Casper.

Postal administration The postcode area originated in 1857 as the SE district. In 1868 it gained some of the area of the short- lived S district, with the rest going to SW. It was divided into numbered districts in 1917, by giving the district closest to London that hosted the head office the suffix \\"1\\" and all others alphabetically based on a locally important parish, chapelry, topological or built environment feature administering or close to the local distribution office. SE28 is a late addition carved out of the existing districts SE2 and SE18 to reflect the building up of a new London district in what had been the meadows and marshes by the tidal Thames in the parish of Plumstead: Thamesmead. Unlike SW, where a consecutive 50%, there ten, districts can more officially be traced into two alphabetical groups excluding SW1, SE has always technically followed the norm in that SE1 is the only head district. However SE19 was drawn up to serve the key distribution office serving Norwood after a complete alphabetical series so that those surrounding it and SE21 (Dulwich): SE20 and SE22 to SE27 are strictly alphabetical afresh (Anerley to West Norwood) but it has never technically been a \\"head district\\".

An Australian international representative goal-kicking , he played his club football for the South Sydney Rabbitohs, with whom he won back-to-back premierships in 1950-51. Club career Whacka Graves scores the first of his four tries in the 1951 Grand Final. Known as \\"Whacka\\", Graves commenced his footballing in Newcastle, New South Wales and came to the attention of Sydney talent scouts when he scored two tries in his international debut representing Newcastle against a touring British side in 1946. Graves joined South Sydney in 1947 and after only four first grade games was selected for New South Wales. He formed a strong backline pairing with Clive Churchill and was victorious in Grand Finals with Souths in 1950 (scoring two tries) and in 1951 (scoring four tries). Graves was appointed captain-coach of Cootamundra in 1954. The team won the Group 9 premiership. Representative career He debuted for Australia against New Zealand in the 1st Test of 1948, played in the rest of that series and then toured Great Britain with the 1948 Kangaroos. He played in two Tests and twenty Tour games returning as the side's top scorer with 16 tries and 35 goals for 188 points. He represented for Australia in seven Test matches (3 Great Britain, 3 New Zealand and 1 France) between 1948 and 1951. He was selected to represent Sydney against France during their 1951 tour of Australasia in a match that ended in a 19-all draw.

Scottish botanist Robert Brown described the species in 1810, and seven subspecies are recognised. One subspecies, G. j. juniperina, is restricted to Western Sydney and environs and is threatened by loss of habitat and housing development. A small prickly leaved shrub between 0.2 and 3 m (8 in to 10 ft) high, G. juniperina grows generally on clay-based or alluvial soils in eucalypt woodland. The flower heads, known as inflorescences, appear from winter to early summer and are red, orange or yellow. Birds visit and pollinate the flowers. Grevillea juniperina plants are killed by bushfire, regenerating afterwards from seed. Grevillea juniperina adapts readily to cultivation and has been important in horticulture as it is the parent of many popular garden hybrids. Description Grevillea juniperina has a spreading or erect habit (growth form) and it grows to between 0.2 and 3 m (8 in to 10 ft) in height. The branchlets are thick and sturdy. The prickly leaves are generally stiff, and are long and wide. They are crowded along the stems. Flowering occurs throughout the year, peaking between mid winter and early summer, though varies between the different subspecies. Subspecies allojohnsonii flowers from September to February, subspecies trinervis flowers from August to December, and subspecies juniperina, amphitricha, sulphurea, villosa and fortis flower in August and September. The spider-flower arrangement of the inflorescence has several individual flowers emerging from a central rounded flower head—reminiscent of the legs of a spider. The flowers are red, pink, orange, yellow or greenish, and are mostly terminal—arising on the ends of stems—though they occasionally arise from axillary buds. They are long. The perianth is finely furred on the outside, while the pistil is smooth; it is long. Flowering is followed by the development of seed pods, each capsule is long, and releases one or two seeds when ripe. The narrow oval seed is and wide, with a swelling at the apex and a short wing. Both surfaces are covered with tiny hairs. Similar species include the Wingello grevillea (Grevillea molyneuxii), which can be distinguished by its prominent midvein on the leaf undersurface, and the red spider-flower (G. speciosa), which has wider leaves with lateral veins and longer pistil. Taxonomy Low spreading habit of a form growing in alt=Low spreading shrub The type specimen for this species was collected from the Port Jackson area (Sydney district) and was described by botanist Robert Brown in 1810, who gave it the specific epithet juniperina which alludes to its juniper-like foliage. Likewise it is commonly known as juniper- or juniper-leaf grevillea, as well as prickly spider-flower. The lectotype was selected by Don MacGillivray in 1993 from a collection by George Caley in 1803 11 km (7 mi) northwest of Prospect in what is now Sydney's outer western suburbs. Brown placed it in the series Lissostylis in his 1810 work Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen. English botanist and explorer Allan Cunningham collected what he called Grevillea sulphurea in 1822 near Coxs River in the Bathurst area, where it grew alongside G. rosmarinifolia and G. arenaria subspecies canescens. This was later synonymised with G. juniperina, before being recognised as a distinct subspecies. George Bentham placed G. juniperina in Section Lissostylis in his 1870 Flora Australiensis. This section has become the Linearifolia group of 45 species of shrub in southeastern Australia. Within this group, G. juniperina is classified in the Speciosa subgroup, five species of bird-pollinated grevilleas found in eastern Australia. The others are G. molyneuxii, G. dimorpha, G. oleoides and G. speciosa. There are seven subspecies of Grevillea juniperina, six of which have been recognised or described by Bob Makinson of the New South Wales Herbarium in 2000: *G. juniperina subsp. allojohnsonii Makinson – is found on the Northern Tablelands and North West Slopes in northern New South Wales, from Walcha north to Tenterfield and Stanhope and Girraween National Park in southern Queensland. It is a prostrate shrub to 30 cm (12 in) high with red flowers. *G. juniperina subsp. amphitricha Makinson – is a prostrate or spreading shrub with yellow or orange flowers that grows to tall and 3 m (10 ft) wide. It is found between Braidwood and Nerriga in the Shoalhaven River catchment on the Southern Tablelands. *G. juniperina subsp. fortis Makinson – is a vigorous red-flowered shrub growing to 1–3 m (3–10 ft) tall that is found on rocky hills and slopes near watercourses—specifically along Ginninderra Creek, the lower reaches of the Molonglo and Cotter Rivers, and the Murrumbidgee River from Pine Island downstream to where it is joined by the Molonglo River—mostly within the Australian Capital Territory. *G. juniperina subsp. juniperina – is endemic to Western Sydney, restricted to clay soils from Blacktown west to Penrith and Marsden Park and north to Pitt Town. It is listed as a vulnerable species on Schedule 2 of the Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995 in New South Wales. Its habitat is threatened by housing development, road upgrading, inappropriate fire regimes, weed invasion, rubbish dumping and trampling either by people or cars. It grows as a spreading shrub that is 0.5–1.5 m (1.5–5 ft) high. *G. juniperina subsp. sulphurea (A.Cunn.) Makinson (formerly var. trinervata) – is a shrub up to 2 m (7 ft) high that grows on alluvial soils and along riverbanks. It is found in the catchments of the Coxs, Kowmung, Wollondilly and Shoalhaven Rivers in the Central and Southern Tablelands, from Tallong to Berrima, as well as Lidsdale to Jenolan State Forest in the southwestern Blue Mountains. It hybridises with G. juniperina subsp. trinervis in the southern and western Blue Mountains. *G. juniperina subsp. trinervis (R.Br.) Makinson (formerly Grevillea trinervis) – is a prickly shrub with a spreading or prostrate habit ranging from 0.5 to 1.2, or rarely 2, m (20 in–7 ft) high and yellow, orange or red flowers. It is found in the western Blue Mountains. *G. juniperina subsp. villosa Makinson – is an upright red- or yellow-flowered shrub up to 2 m (7 ft) high found along watercourses in eucalypt forest east and northeast of Braidwood, as well as Currockbilly in southeastern New South Wales. Distribution and habitat Unlike other Proteaceae generally not found on clay soils, Grevillea juniperina subsp. juniperina is found in Cumberland Plain and Castlereagh Woodland communities on clay-loam soils, growing alongside such species as forest redgum (Eucalyptus tereticornis), mugga ironbark (E. sideroxylon), thin-leaved stringybark (E. eugenioides), broad-leaved red ironbark (E. fibrosa), grey box (E. moluccana), white feather honeymyrtle (Melaleuca decora), boxthorn (Bursaria spinosa), sickle wattle (Acacia falcata) and Dillwynia tenuifolia. Grevillea juniperina subsp. sulphurea is found on gravelly alluvial soil alongside Leptospermum species, and G. juniperina subsp. trinervis is found on alluvial soil with poor drainage in woodland or along riverbanks in association with snow gum (Eucalyptus pauciflora), mountain gum (E. dalrympleana), Dillwynia retorta and river lomatia (Lomatia myricoides). The annual rainfall in regions where G. juniperina grows is 600 to 800 mm (24–32 in). Ecology Killed by bushfire, Grevillea juniperina regenerates afterwards by seeds that germinate after lying dormant in the soil, stimulated by exposure to heat and smoke. Plants over 1 m (3 ft) high produce more seed. Intervals of 10 to 15 years between fires are thought to be most beneficial for the species' survival, as this allows seed numbers to build up in the soil over time. Grevillea juniperina can also colonise disturbed areas, though overgrowth of Bursaria spinosa can negatively impact its spread. Grevillea juniperina is pollinated by birds, with bees also recorded visiting flowers. The leaves are food for caterpillars of the cyprotus blue (Candalides cyprotus). A springtail species of Australian origin—Calvatomina superba—was found on Grevillea juniperina cultivated at the Lost Gardens of Heligan in Cornwall. Cultivation alt=orange-yellow flower closeup alt=red flower closeup alt=pink flower closeup alt=pink flower closeup Allan Cunningham sent seed of G. juniperina to England in 1820; it was grown there the following year. Baron Charles von Hügel grew the species in Vienna in 1831. It has been grown outdoors in southern England, particularly G. juniperina subspecies sulphurea. Grevillea juniperina adapts easily to cultivation and grows in a wide range of soils and aspects in locations with good drainage. Long-flowering, it attracts birds such as honeyeaters with its nectar. The prickly dense foliage is also a good nesting site and shelter, particularly for smaller birds, such as finches. Many forms and hybrids have been commercially propagated and sold, some having more horticultural appeal than others. Low winter temperatures promote more prolific flowering and pruning promotes dense foliage. Plants are readily propagated by cuttings or seed, although propagation by cuttings is required to ensure the new plants have the same characteristics of the parent. Direct contact with the plant may cause a skin rash. Many cultivars have been selected for horticultural use, either selected forms or hybrids with other Grevillea species. One prominent early breeder was Leo Hodge of W Tree, Victoria. Hodge became interested in breeding grevilleas after finding seedlings in his garden. His first trials involved crossing G. juniperina with G. victoriae, producing G. 'Poorinda Queen', which was the first to flower, followed by G. 'Poorinda Constance', G. 'Poorinda Leane' and G. 'Poorinda Pink Coral' respectively, all in 1952. Cultivars include: *'Allyn Radiance' – derived from a prostrate orange and prostrate red forms of G. juniperina. *'Audrey' – G. juniperina crossed with G. victoriae. Bred in 1957 by George Althofer, who named it after his wife. It grows to 2 m (7 ft) high and wide and produces orange-red flowers over many months. It is popular in South Africa and the USA. *'Canberra Gem' – G. juniperina crossed with G. rosmarinifolia. Registered with the Australian Cultivar Registration Authority in 1976. *'Canterbury Gold' – prostrate yellow form of G. juniperina crossed with Grevillea parvula. *'Goldfever' – G. juniperina crossed with Grevillea rhyolitica. *'H22' (Gold Cluster) – a dense growing prostrate selection with yellow flowers. *'Lunar Light' – a low- growing form with variegated leaves and orange-pink flowers. It is suitable for rockeries. *'Molonglo' – a form with a low–spreading habit and larger orange flowers with red styles. It was bred by Rudolph Willing of Australian National University in 1964, from two disparate forms of juniperina, an erect red-flowered form from around Canberra and a yellow-flowered spreading prostrate form from the western slopes of the Budawang Range in 1964. It is named after the Molonglo River. *'New Blood' – a compact red-flowered shrub resulting from a cross of 'Molonglo' cultivar with G. rhyolitica. *'Old Gold' – a low spreading shrub with yellow new growth, lobed leaves and greyish- yellow flowers with pink styles. It is derived from G. juniperina crossed with Grevillea ilicifolia. *'Orange Box' – G. juniperina crossed with G. victoriae. *'Pink Lady' – G. juniperina crossed with G. rosmarinifolia. Bred by Stan Kirby of Queanbeyan, it was grown widely in the early 1970s. A shrub to 60 cm (2 ft) high and 3 m (10 ft) wide with pale pink flowers. *'Poorinda Adorning' – a seedling that grew in Hodge's garden, registered in 1978. The original plant grew in 1965. *'Poorinda Annette' – a cross with the small-flowered form of Grevillea alpina. *'Poorinda Beauty' – a cross with Grevillea alpina. *'Poorinda Belinda' – a cross with a hybrid of the yellow flower form of Grevillea obtusiflora and Grevillea alpina. *'Poorinda Constance' – a cross with Grevillea victoriae. *'Poorinda Jeanie' – a red-flowering shrub that grows up to 2 m (7 ft) high. It is derived from a cross with Grevillea alpina. *'Poorinda Leane' – a cross with G. victoriae. It is a spreading shrub to 4 m (13 ft) high with buff or apricot flowers. *'Poorinda Pink Coral' – a cross with G. victoriae, named for the colour of its flowers. *'Poorinda Queen' – derived from a cross with a yellow-flowered form of Grevillea victoriae. It has apricot-pink flowers. *'Poorinda Refrain' – a cross with Grevillea floribunda. *'Poorinda Rachel' – a 1 m (3 ft) high hybrid cross with Grevillea alpina, which has buff-cerise flowers, and was developed in 1965–66. *'Poorinda Rosalie' – a taller rose-red flowered hybrid with G. victoriae, developed in 1967–68. *'Poorinda Signet' – a cross with Grevillea lanigera. *× semperflorens – a hybrid of English origin derived from a cross of Grevillea juniperina var. sulphurea with Grevillea thelemanniana.

Waha, church tower St-Etienne Dedicatory stone commemorating the consecration of St. Stephen's church by Theodwin of Liège on June 20, 1050  Etymology  The name \\"Waha\\" comes from the Celtic proper name \\"Wachart\\". The Latin name of the location was \\"Wachardi mansus\\", meaning \\"Wachart's dwelling\\".  History  Waha in the 10th century belonged to the territory of count Immon. The first church was built only 100 meters from the present church and was dedicated to Saint Martin of Tours. In 1050 the present church of Saint Étienne was dedicated by Theodwin, prince-bishop of Liège. The collegiate chapter of Saint Étienne was dissolved during the time of the French First Republic.  Art historical significance  The church of Saint Étienne in Waha is one of the oldest Romanesque churches in Belgium. The nave of the church is only four arches long. The choir has a rectangular shape and is unvaulted. It is also lower than the nave ceiling, which is not uncommon in early Mosan architecture. The westwork tower is slightly younger than the rest of the church. In 1956-1957 the church underwent major restoration work as well as art historical investigation. It was then that the dedication stone from 1050 was found. There are also some sculptures by the Master of Waha in the church. The church's greatest treasure is the reliquary shrine of Saint Étienne.

It is an essential performance practice, and is used often in vocal and instrumental music. On the veena, sitar, sarangi and other plucked stringed instruments, it is usually done by pushing the strings across the frets to vary their effective length and tension; compare portamento and finger vibrato. This can be done on wind instruments like the bansuri by using the fingers to cover the holes in a manner that the changes between discrete pitches are imperceptible. It is considered a sort of alankar, or ornament. Meend is an important part of any classical performance; however, it is a technique not possible on a hand- held harmonium often used in musical concerts (or on the santoor). For this reason, traditionalists singing khyal prefer an accompaniment on an instrument such as a sarangi that can perform meend.

The demands are influenced by both external and internal factors and are balanced by the creation of purchase order requests to keep supplies at a reasonable or prescribed level. Stock management is important for every other business enterprise. Retail supply chain Stock management in the retail supply chain follows the following sequence: # Request for new stock from stores to head office, # Head office issues purchase orders to the vendor, # Vendor ships the goods, # Warehouse receives the goods, # Warehouse stores and distributes to the stores, # Shops and/or consumers (e.g. wholesale shops) receive the goods, # Goods are sold to customers at the shops. The management of the inventory in the supply chain involves managing the physical quantities as well as the costing of the goods as it flows through the supply chain. In managing the cost prices of the goods throughout the supply chain, several costing methods are employed: # Retail method # Weighted Average Price method # FIFO (First In First Out) method # LIFO (Last In First Out) method # LPP (Last Purchase Price) method # BNM (Bottle neck method) The calculation can be done for different periods. If the calculation is done on a monthly basis, then it is referred to the periodic method. In this method, the available stock is calculated by: ADD Stock at beginning of period ADD Stock purchased during the period AVERAGE total cost by total qty to arrive at the Average Cost of Goods for the period. This Average Cost Price is applied to all movements and adjustments in that period. Ending stock in qty is arrived at by Applying all the changes in qty to the Available balance. Multiplying the stock balance in qty by the Average cost gives the Stock cost at the end of the period. Using the perpetual method, the calculation is done upon every purchase transaction. Thus, the calculation is the same based on the periodic calculation whether by period (periodic) or by transaction (perpetual). The only difference is the 'periodicity' or scope of the calculation.  Periodic is done monthly  Perpetual is done for the duration of the purchase until the next purchase In practice, the daily averaging has been used to closely approximate the perpetual method. 6\\\\. Bottle neck method ( depends on proper planning support) Software applications SaaS inventory management software is a tool to help efficiently manage stock. While the capabilities of applications vary, most inventory management applications give organizations a structured method of accounting for all incoming and outgoing inventory within their facilities. Organizations may save costs associated with manual inventory counts, administrative errors and reductions in inventory stock-outs. Often tracking stock just through sales and returns is not enough for retailers and does not meet the demands of customers multichannel expectations. Customers expect retailers to have real-time knowledge of stock availability. This can be a challenge for retailers who may have on-line as well as bricks and mortar outlets. A good stock management system will be able to list all stock options with a size colour matrix as well as give live reports on best or worst sellers, supply chain and sales staff. Many large organizations use sophisticated ERP systems such as Oracle EBS and SAP for stock management.SAP, Fine tune inventory management and optimise service – with powerful software from SAP, accessed 8 October 2018 Inventory modules in these ERP systems provide many of the options needed to manage inventory. The stock size needs to correspond to the amount of products which are sold. If the stock is too large (especially with perishable goods as fruit, vegetables, ...) there is a risk of financial losses as some of the stock may spoil while sitting in the store. To reduce this risk (and keep financial losses as small as possible), there is hence benefit in precisely recording the weekly purchases of the shop's customers. This can be done through purchases tracking per individual shopper.How supermarkets get your data – and what they do with itWhen AI meets your shopping experience it knows what you buy – and what you ought to buy12 Sneaky Ways That Big Retailers Track Your Every Move Business models Just-in-time Inventory (JIT), Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) and Customer Managed Inventory (CMI) are a few of the popular models being employed by organizations looking to have greater stock management control. JIT is a model that attempts to replenish inventory for organizations when the inventory is required. The model attempts to avoid excess inventory and its associated costs. As a result, companies receive inventory only when the need for more stock is approaching. VMI(vendor managed inventory) and (co-managed inventory) are two business models that adhere to the JIT inventory principles. VMI gives the vendor in a vendor/customer relationship the ability to monitor, plan and control inventory for their customers. Customers relinquish the order making responsibilities in exchange for timely inventory replenishment that increases organizational efficiency. CMIallows the customer to order and control their inventory from their vendors/suppliers. Both VMI and CMI benefit the vendor as well as the customer. Vendors see a significant increase in sales due to increased inventory turns and cost savings realized by their customers, while customers realize similar benefits.

Derived from the older plucked tambur, it has a long, fretted neck and a round metal or wooden soundbox which is often covered on the front with a skin or acrylic head similar to that of a banjo. The instrument is held vertically, with the soundbox resting in the player's lap or between the calves. The bow is grasped sideways, with the little, ring and middle fingers pressing on the horsehairs, while the thumb and index fingers hold the rightmost wooden edge of the bow. The leftmost strings of the instrument unite into a single course to form a doubled-string which is tuned to a unison that is lifted slightly from the bridge. This is where all melodic playing takes place. The rest are sympathetic strings numbering from 4 to 6 which are tuned to the octave, fifth and/or fourth of the main doubled-string. Due to the special nature of the instrument, the neck behaves as though it was unfretted despite the ordinary placement of numerous frets (anywhere from 24 to 34 or more to the octave). That is to say, the fingers can press down on unfretted parts of the neck to achieve the same effect as stopping the frets. This allows the glissandi and portamenti to be executed flawlessly which constitute the primary characteristics of yaylı tambur. Moreover, the frets can be moved about depending on the tastes and choices of the player to achieve correct intonation of a given makam. Dr. Ozan Yarman has proposed an alternate 24-tone tuning and fretting for the tanbur that he has applied to his own instrument, which replaces the Arel-Ezgi-Uzdilek tone-system in use for Turkish Art music while also relying on the same array of accustomed microtonal accidentals to notate.

Hayek has admitted that some Rotana artists, such as singer Elissa, get more attention from the record company executives than the rest. She was also very disappointed with the promotional efforts made for Ta'ala Albi, and the low sales figures – compared to Katabtillak – in both Egypt and the Persian Gulf region. She also showed very disappointment in Rotana for claiming that they were not able to secure her a performance at the 2007 Hala Febrayer Festival in Kuwait, and later that year she eventually resigned from her contract with Rotana.

He served as the Chief Medical Examiner of Broward County, Florida for seventeen years, during which time he conducted autopsies on a number of famous individuals, including Anna Nicole Smith. Prior to his appointment to that position, he served as Allegheny County's Coroner serving metro Pittsburgh. Early life and professional career Perper was born in Bacău, Romania and he escaped the Nazis during World War II and, following the war, the Russians. At the age of 18, moved to Israel, graduating from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem Faculty of Medicine (medical school) in 1960 and Faculty of Law (law school) in 1966. In 1969, he finished post graduate studies in forensic pathology at Johns Hopkins University. He served as Associate Medical Examiner, Senior Research Fellow and then Chief Medical Examiner in Baltimore, Maryland from 1969 to 1971. Between 1971 and 1994, while living in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Perper was a toxicologist and then Chief Forensic Pathologist in the Allegheny County Coroner's Office (now called the Medical Examiner's Office), serving under Cyril Wecht. Allegheny County Coroner In 1980, Wecht was elected to the Allegheny County Board of Commissioners. Wecht did not resign as Coroner until January 9, two days after his swearing-in as Commissioner, as the law did not prohibit him from holding both the offices of Coroner and Commissioner. He resigned under pressure from a variety of sources, including his predecessor as coroner, Ralph Stalter, a Republican, and the administration of Governor Dick Thornburgh, also a Republican. Wecht initially recommended that Perper succeed him, and indeed Perper held the title of Acting Coroner until Thornburgh appointed Sanford Edburg to succeed Wecht. While Perper initially rejected the appointment as unconstitutional, the State Supreme Court upheld Thornburgh's right to appoint Edberg, who duly took over the office of Coroner on March 2, 1981. The transition was not met without a brief physical altercation between the two men. Perper would return to the Coroner's office in January 1982, after he defeated Edberg in the fall 1981 general election. Los Angeles County Medical Examiner appointment In February 1991, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously to name Perper the County's new Chief Medical Examiner. While Perper initially accepted the posting, he backed-out of the job two months before he was to begin his duties. Perper cited a variety of reasons behind his decision, including the economic-media reports indicated Perper and his wife, a real estate agent, believed they could not afford the kind of home to which they had become accustomed-and the emotional-Perper's wife also did not want to leave behind the couple's friends. He would therefore remain Allegheny County Coroner for another three years. Broward County Chief Medical Examiner Perper did resign as Allegheny County Coroner in 1994, after he was appointed Chief Medical Examiner of Broward County, Florida by Governor Lawton Chiles. Notable autopsiesKrissy Taylor= Perper performed the autopsy on Krissy Taylor, the 17-year-old model who died of bronchial asthma in 1995, after collapsing in her parents' home. Krissy was the younger sister of model Niki Taylor. =Steve Bechler= Perper performed the autopsy of Steve Bechler after the pitcher's death on February 17, 2003. According to Perper: \\"It is my professional opinion that the toxicity of ephedra played a significant role in the death of Mr. Bechler, although it's impossible to define mathematically the contribution of each one of the factors in his unfortunate death due to heatstroke.\\" During the investigation Perper interviewed Bechler's family. He found that Bechler was overweight, out of shape, was not yet accustomed to the warm and humid weather in South Florida, was on a primarily liquid or semi-liquid diet, did not feel well or eat the night before he collapsed and had high blood pressure, was using Xenadrine and had abnormal liver functions. =Anna Nicole Smith= Perper oversaw as Gertrude M. Juste and Stephen Cina examined and autopsied the body of Anna Nicole Smith in 2007. He also had significant involvement in the hearing deciding the fate of her body and has made numerous TV appearances on Nancy Grace and various other shows in relation to this. Perper revealed his findings that Smith's death was due to an accidental lethal combination of therapeutic levels of 3 benzodiazepines and chloral hydrate. Chloral hydrate was believed to be the major contributing factor. An infection in her left buttock was also a contributory factor. After reviewing evidence in collaboration with legal authorities, he judged the death \\"accidental\\" and not suicide or homicide, or death by natural causes. Retirement In September 2011, Governor Rick Scott announced he would not reappoint Perper to another three-year term as Chief Medical Examiner. Perper expressed surprise at the decision, and subsequently announced his intention to resign at the end of October of that year, and enter retirement.

In many cases, the ragas contain the same swaras (notes), then the pakad also contains information about gayaki or chalan (the way the notes are to be ordered and played/sung). Usually, the pakad is formed from short convolutions of the arohana and avarohana, while in some cases it is quite different from them.

Excessive stock is also associated with loss of revenue owing to additional capital bound with the purchase or simply storage space taken. Excessive stock can result from over delivery from a supplier or from poor ordering and management of stock by a buyer for the stock. Overstock also known as seasonal overstock, consists of first quality overstock that must be sold. At the end of a selling season, all designated merchandise is removed from the selling floor, boxed and sold to liquidation companies (e.g., all winter coats are removed from the selling floor mid-spring to make room in the stores for swimwear). When referring to overstock merchandise in the form of consumer goods in a retail operation, the term refers to goods that have never been purchased by a customer but that are considered excessive stock from shelves and/or warehouses. Excessive stock is typically discarded of in the following ways: returned to the manufacturer or original distributor; liquidated to companies that then resell it on the secondary wholesale or retail market; sold at an extreme discount to existing customers; or sold to salvage companies which then process metals and components of value. Economic implication The initial damage caused by excessive stock is an early exhaustion of cash flow, which leads to the subsequent loss of disposable capital available for investing. With perishable supplies, excessive stock can cause the loss of millions of currency units as the product's freshness may deteriorate to such an extent that it cannot be sold, as is the case with dairy products, fresh baked goods, flowers, produce, fish, and meat. It is also true of consumables such as oil, gasoline, paints, and medications. Time-sensitive items such as periodical literature are similarly at risk.

The first prahara of the day begins at sunrise, and the fourth prahara of the day ends at sunset. A second round of four praharas unfolds during the night, between sunset and sunrise. The traditional system of praharas overlaps with the traditional system of muhurtas also, which is based on precise astronomical calculations. Thus, the day can be regarded as divided into eight praharas (of three hours each) or thirty muhurtas (of 48 minutes each). In both systems, the day commences with sunrise. The timing of the two systems coincides only at sunrise and sunset (four praharas coincide with fifteen muhurtas at the twelve-hour, or 720-minute, point). History In the ancient Puranas we see the day divided into eight praharas: four for the day and four for the night.Bhagavata Purana (also known as Srimad Bhagavatam) 3.11.10 The concept still prevails today in India, particularly in connection with the performance of Indian classical music (see below). Timing The first prahara is commonly placed at sunrise, although some sources place it at the brahma- muhurta, a period of time before sunrise (around 4.30 amwhen Venus can be sighted).Indic astronomical calculations identify the brahma-muhurta as the penultimate muhurta before dawn (in other words, the first of two muhurtas, or periods of 48 minutes, before dawn). If sunrise is at 6 am, the brahma-muhurta starts 96 minutes earlier, at 4:24 am. (The traditional calculations are available through GCal, computer software developed by the ISKCON GBC for the purposes of calculating the Vaishnava calendar, now available online and as iTunes app). See also Āgama-kosha, vol 4, by Saligrama Krishna, Ramachandra Rao, Rama R. Rao, Kalpatharu Research Academy, 1991. Other secondary sources speak of the brahma-muhurta as the antepenultimate muhurta before dawn (in other words, the first of three muhurtas before dawn). Assuming a 6 am sunrise, this would place the start of the brahma-muhurta at 3:36 am; see Gaya Charan Tripathi, \\"Communication with God: The Daily Puja Ceremony in the Jagannatha Temple\\" and Times of India. Yet other sources conflate the two accounts: they claim that the \\"brahma-muhurta\\" begins two muhurtas before dawn (i.e., 4:24), but say that it begins at 3:36 am (which would be three muhurtas before dawn); see the ISKCON program for morning sadhana. The precession of the equinoxes may complicate things yet further; see e.g. the discussion of Muhurta: yearly calibration. The concept of prahar originated where the lengths of the day and night were based on actual, observable sunrise and sunset. The four praharas of the day start at sunrise, and the four praharas of the night at sunset. If the location is near the equator, where day and night are the same length year round, the praharas of the day and the praharas of the night will be of equal length (three hours each). In other regions, where the relative length of day and night varies according to the season, the praharas of the day will be longer or shorter than the praharas of the night. Contemporary discussions of prahara often use 6:00 am (the time of sunrise at the equator and at the equinoxes) as a theoretical fixed point of reference for mapping out the praharas at three-hour intervals (6-9, 9-12, etc.). This scheme is a useful pedagogical tool and an efficient way of applying the concept of prahara in a technological \\"clock\\" culture. However, it's important to realize that this rigid schema most likely does not capture the original application of prahara. In a traditional, non-technological culture, the length of day and night are based on observable sunrise and sunset. The day, which starts at sunrise and ends at sunset, is divided into four praharas of equal length; and, the night, which starts at sunset and ends at sunrise, is also divided into four equal watches. During the summer, when the days are longer than the nights, the praharas of the day will be longer than the praharas of the night, and vice versa during the winter.Some scholars correctly infer that in seasons (and regions) where days and nights are unequal in length, the praharas expand and contract in length. See Duncan Forbes' early comment on the pahar (= prahar) in Northern India: \\"The first pahar of the day began at sunrise, and of the night at sunset; and since the time from sunrise to noon made exactly two pahars, it follows that in the north of India the pahar must have varied from three and a-half hours about the summer solstice, to two and a-half in winter, the pahars of the night varying inversely.\\" (Duncan Forbes, LL.D, transl. Bāgh O Bahār; or Tales of the Four Derwishes, by Mīr Amman of Dihli. London: W. H. Allen & Co. 1882, (p. 23, note 1). What we are encountering here is a difference between modern cultures that rely on clock time, and traditional cultures where the length of a day is observed in the sky, from sunset to sundown. The question of how to handle the praharas when days and nights are unequal in length is critical for timing the performance of ragas, since each raga is ideally performed during a certain prahara. Indian classical music Some ragas of the Indian classical music are prescribed to be performed at a particular prahara to maximize their aesthetic effects (see samay). Perhaps the earliest mention of the relation between raga and time is Narada's Sangita Makaranda, written sometime between the 7th and 11th century, which warns musicians against playing ragas at the incorrect time of day.Walter Kaufmann, The Ragas of North India, Calcutta: Oxford (1968) Pandit V.N. Bhatkhande (1860-1936), who formulated the modern system of Indian musical thāt, states that the correct time (or prahara) to play a raga has a relation to its thāt, or scale.For Bhatkande's assignation of ragas to praharas, see Anthony Peter Westbrook, \\"Testing the Time Theory,\\" Hinduism Today, February 2000. But note, contrary to Westbrook's assertion, that the concept of praharas existed long before Bhatkande made use of them in the 19th century; see, for example, the numerous references in the 16th century scripture Caitanya Caritamrta.  Modern etymology and usage  The word commonly used in India, Pakistan, Nepal is prahar (Hindi/Nepali प्रहर, Urduپہر), more commonly pronounced paher or peher and in West Bengal and Bangladesh is prohor (Bengali প্রহর) in Marathi it is pronounced as Prahar (प्रहर). In Hindi and Urdu the word for \\"afternoon\\" is dopahar (= two prahars).Henry M. Hoenigswald, Spoken Hindustani, vol. 2, p. 403. Henry Holt (1945) In Bengali the corresponding word is dwi-prohor or more commonly dupur.It's known as Paar in, Konkani,where First Prahara is known as Faantya Paar(from Sanskrit, प्रातः प्रहर), and afternoon is known as Donpaar.
