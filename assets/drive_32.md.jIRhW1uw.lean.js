Cologne, Neuss, D√ºsseldorf and Duisburg lie on the Rhine while Minden lies on the Weser. Until the timetable change in December 2016, this services was called the Westfalen-Express and ended in D√ºsseldorf Hauptbahnhof. History  Until the timetable revision of 2002, the NRW-Express (RE 1) operated with five, and sometimes up to eight, double-deck carriages from Aachen to Bielefeld. In 2002 services were extended to Minden and at the same time the service was split into two routes. The Westfalen-Express was established, taking over the Hamm‚ÄìBielefeld‚ÄìMinden section and extending to D√ºsseldorf. This change was intended in particular to improve the timeliness of the entire service. A service called line RE 6a was put into operation as a pre-operation for the Rhein-Ruhr-Express on 13 December 2015. For the first time, D√ºsseldorf Hauptbahnhof was regularly connected with Cologne/Bonn Airport, serving on the way Neuss Hauptbahnhof, Dormagen, Cologne Hauptbahnhof, with some services also stopping in K√∂ln Messe/Deutz in the peak. This interim line was scheduled to be operated with double sets of class 425 EMUs. The reason for the temporary separation of RE 6 and RE 6a was the lack of emergency brake connections between the double-deck cars used on line RE 6 (Minden‚ÄìD√ºsseldorf), which were not allowed to run through the Cologne Airport loop. At the change of timetable in December 2016, the rolling stock was replaced by retrofitted double-decker trains, the RE 6 was extended to Cologne/Bonn Airport and the line RE 6a service was discontinued. The RE 6 services has been named the Rhein-Weser-Express since its extension. Route  The Rhein-Weser-Express runs on a total of four railway lines: *all of the Hamm‚ÄìMinden line (which carries all forms of regional and long-distance passenger services and freight traffic over a four-track route.) *all of the Dortmund‚ÄìHamm (which carries all forms of regional and long-distance passenger services) *all of the Dortmund-Duisburg line (on the long-distance tracks, which carry all regional and long-distance services), *the Cologne‚ÄìDuisburg line between Duisburg and D√ºsseldorf. In this four to six track section the Rhein-Weser-Express uses the S-Bahn tracks or the so-called local tracks where they exist, along with the Rhein-Haard-Express (RE 2) and the Rhein-Emscher- Express (RE 3), the Rhein-Hellweg-Express (RE 11) and the Rhein-IJssel-Express (RE 19). Only the NRW-Express (RE 1) and the Rhein-Express (RE 5) use the long-distance tracks. * the M√∂nchengladbach‚ÄìD√ºsseldorf railway between D√ºsseldorf and Neuss (together with other regional services), * the Lower Left Rhine Railway between Neuss and Cologne (together with other regional and S-Bahn services and freight trains). * the Hohenzollern Bridge between Cologne Hbf and K√∂ln Messe/Deutz (together with all regional and long-distance trains), * the Sieg Railway between K√∂ln Messe/Deutz and the Cologne Airport Northwest junction (together with all regional and long-distance trains), * the Cologne Airport loop to Cologne/Bonn Airport (together with all S-Bahn, regional and long-distance trains). Like the Rhein-Emscher-Express, the Rhein- Weser-Express runs for a large part of its route of the trunk line of the Cologne-Minden Railway Company (, CME). Between Dortmund and Duisburg, however, it uses the more developed and more centrally located route through the Ruhr built by the Bergisch-M√§rkische Railway Company (Bergisch-M√§rkische Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft, BME). Rail services  Since the timetable change in December 2010, the Rhein-Weser-Express has run during the day at hourly intervals from Minden to D√ºsseldorf (extending to Cologne/Bonn Airport since December 2016), over the whole route between 0700 and 2200. Until the timetable change in December 2010 some services in the off-peak lengths turned around in Dortmund, Bielefeld or Hamm. Frequencies are increased by other services: the NRW-Express also runs between Hamm and Cologne and the Rhein- Hellweg-Express (RE 11) runs between Hamm and D√ºsseldorf, the Ems-B√∂rde-Bahn (RB 69) runs between Bielefeld and Hamm, the Weser-Leine-Express (RE 70) and the Porta-Express (RE 78) run between Bielefeld and Minden. Large sections of the RE 6 proceeds parallel with S-Bahn lines and it has some of the character of a fast S-Bahn service and is perceived by passengers accordingly. The service is operated by DB Regio NRW, using push‚Äìpull trains of five double- deck carriages, mostly hauled by class 146.0 locomotives. Class 111 electric locomotives are regularly substituted on the route. The maximum speed of 160 km/h can be reached on long sections. The average speed is 84.5 km/h. Some services are operated with class 425 electric multiple units. The Rhein-Weser- Express is linked with the rest of the transport network in North Rhine- Westphalia and Lower Saxony in Cologne, D√ºsseldorf, Duisburg, Essen, Dortmund, Hamm, Bielefeld, Herford, L√∂hne and Minden. Tenders of the route Four public transport associations are involved in the operation of the Rhein- Weser-Express: the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr (transport association of the Rhine-Ruhr, VRR, the Verkehrsgemeinschaft Ruhr-Lippe (transport community of Westphalia-Lippe), Zweckverband SPNV M√ºnsterland (regional rail transport association of M√ºnsterland, ZVM) and Verkehrsverbund OstWestfalenLippe (transport association of East Westphalia-Lippe, VVOWL). The \\"large traffic\\" contract (gro√üe Verkehrsvertrag) that covers the route between Dortmund and D√ºsseldorf was terminated by the VRR on 12 June 2008 without notice, since then DB has operated this branch under direction. On 19 December 2008 the Administrative Court of Gelsenkirchen ruled that the termination of the \\"large traffic\\" contract had been unlawful. The North Rhine-Westphalian authorities submitted a joint tendering schedule, according to which the RE 6 line was to be tendered together with the RE 5 Rhein-Express. Operation for the RE 6 was to commence on 11 December 2016. Within the framework of the so-called \\"Rhein- Ruhr-Express\\" interim contract, services are being provided by DB Regio from December 2016 until the start-up of the Rhine-Ruhr Express services.

He was the son of Thomas Ewin, formerly a grocer, and latterly a brewer in partnership with one Sparks of St. Sepulchre's, Cambridge, by a daughter of a coal merchant named Howell of St. Clement's in the same town. Education and early career He was educated at St. John's College, Cambridge, taking the degrees of B.A. 1753, M.A. 1756, and LL.D. 11 June 1766. He is said to have received a diploma of LL.D. from the University of Edinburgh in or about 1778, but his name does not occur in the Catalogue of Graduates, 1858. On the death of his father he inherited his share of the brewing business and a handsome fortune, which he largely increased by private usury. He was placed on the Commission of the Peace for the town and county of Cambridge. In 1769 he joined his old college tutor, Dr. William Samuel Powell, in opposing the act for better paving, lighting, and watching the town, by which the design was hindered for a time. William Cole wrote: :\\"Being much of his father's turn, busy and meddling in other people's concerns, got the ill will of most persons in the town and university. ‚Ä¶The gownsmen bore him a particular grudge for interfering much in their affairs. ‚Ä¶ They often broke the doctor's windows, as they said he had been caught listening on their staircases and doors. ‚Ä¶ Dr. Ewin, as did his father, squinted very much, hence his nickname of \\"Dr. Squintum\\" The \\"usurious affair\\" In January 1777 a report was current at Cambridge that he had been detected in lending money at an enormous interest in 1775 and 1776 to a scholar of Trinity College named William Bird, then a minor, and without a father, whom he had also caused to be imprisoned in a sponging-house. The sum advanced was ¬£750, for which he took notes to the amount of ¬£1,090. This \\"usurious affair\\", as Cole terms it, came to light at a very unlucky time, for he had been promised the chancellorship of the Diocese of Ely, which fell vacant in the following May. Eighteen months, however, were allowed to elapse before the university took action. The trial came on in the Vice-Chancellor's court 14 October 1778, when Ewin made but a sorry defence. On 21 October, he was sentenced to be suspended from all degrees taken, or to be taken, and expelled from the university. The delegates on his appeal confirmed the suspension, but revoked the expulsion. He thereupon applied to the court of king's bench for a mandamus to restore him to his degrees. The court after full argument awarded the writ in June 1779, on the ground that there being no express statute of the university forbidding usury or the lending of money to minors, the Vice-Chancellor's court had no jurisdiction in the case. Lord Mansfield, however, censured Ewin's conduct in the strongest terms, stigmatised him as \\"a corrupter of youth and an usurer\\", and suggested that a statute to meet such cases in future should be passed, and that he might be struck out of the Commission of the Peace. On 20 October 1779 he was restored to his degree of LL.D., but was put out of the county commission in 1781. Later career Eventually he fixed himself at Brentford, Middlesex, where \\"his strict attention to the administration of parochial concerns, quick to discern and severe to condemn every species of idleness and imposition, created him many enemies, particularly among the lower orders of people\\" (Gent. Mag. vol. lxxiv. pt. ii. p. 1174). He died at Brentford Butts on 29 Dec. 1804, aged 73, and was buried in the chapel of New Brentford, where a monument by Flaxman records his many virtues (Lysons, Environs of London, Supplement, p. 103). He was supposed to have left property amounting to over ¬£100,000. Portraits No portrait of Ewin is known to be extant, but there is a print dated 1773 representing Mr. Stanley, grandson of the Earl of Derby, spitting in his face, for which affront the doctor prosecuted him. He was the subject of many effusions of undergraduate hate in both Latin and English, some of which were printed and hawked by ballad mongers about the town. Two are given by Cole.

There are two main classes of FGE, aerobic and anaerobic. FGE activates sulfatases, which are essential for the degradation of sulfate esters. The catalytic activity of sulfatases is dependent upon a formylglycine (sometimes called oxoalanine) residue in the active site. Aerobic The aerobic enzyme has a structure homologous to the complex alpha/beta topology found in the gene product of human sulfatase- modifying factor 1 (SUMF1). Aerobic FGE converts a cysteine residue in the highly conserved consensus sequence CXPXR to fGly. To do so, FGE ‚Äúactivates‚Äù its target by utilizing mononuclear copper. The substrate first binds to copper, increasing reactivity of the substrate-copper complex with oxygen. Activation is then accomplished through oxidation of a cysteine residue in the substrate-copper complex. Due to the nature of this reaction, FGE is termed a ‚Äúcopper-dependent metalloenzyme. left Anaerobic The most well-studied anaerobic FGE is the bacterial AtsB, an iron-sulfur cluster containing enzyme present in Klebsiella pneumoniae, that is able to convert either cysteine or serine to fGly with a distinctly different mechanism than the aerobic form. While AtsB can convert either, its activity increases four fold when in the presence of cysteine over serine. AtsB is 48% similar to an enzyme present in Clostridium perfringens. Both enzymes possess the Cx3Cx2C motif unique to the radical S-adenosyl methionine superfamily and are able to use a reduction reaction to cleave S-adenosyl methionine. These two enzymes fall into a larger group called the anaerobic Sulfatase Maturing Enzymes, which are able to convert cysteine into fGly without the use of oxygen. Protein domain In molecular biology, \\"formylglycine-generating enzyme\\" (sometimes annotated as formylglycine-generating sulfatase enzyme) is the name of the FGE protein domain, whether or not the protein is catalytically active. Both prokaryotic and eukaryotic homologs of FGE possess highly conserved active sites ‚Äî including the catalytic cysteine residues required for enzymatic function. Activation of molecular oxygen is thought to be carried out by conserved residues close to the FGE catalytic site in aerobic organisms. The catalytic cysteine residues are involved in a thiol-cysteine exchange leading to the ultimate production of fGly. Disease states In humans, mutations in SUMF1 result in defects in FGE, which in turn causes the impairment of sulfatases. The result is a disease called multiple sulfatase deficiency (MSD), in which the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans or sulfolipids can cause early infant death. This disease can be further differentiated into neonatal, late infantile, and juvenile, with neonatal being the most severe. Common symptoms include ichthyosis, hypotonia, skeletal abnormalities, and overall cognitive decline. In 2017 Weidner et. al., found an association with SUMF1 expression and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) development. As of January 2020, there were more than 100 reported cases worldwide cases of MSD. Known substrates for SUMF1 are: N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase (GALNS), arylsulfatase A (ARSA), steroid sulfatase (STS) and arylsulfatase E (ARSE); all molecules that contain cysteine.

Education  Todd grew up watching the Apollo launches from his beachfront hometown of Cocoa Beach, Florida, where his father was also employed in the space program. It was there, at a young age, that he was immersed in and captivated by both sea and space environments. Todd graduated from the University of Houston with a degree in geology in 1982. He has worked in several underwater habitats, piloted many submersibles, and has conducted myriad expeditions on the parallels between living and working in outer space and \\"inner space\\".

Mail Art: An Annotated Bibliography, Metuchen, 1991 Bleus was the first artist who systematically used scents in plastic arts. In 1978 he wrote the olfactory manifesto The Thrill of Working with Odours in which he deplores the lack of interest in scents in the visual arts. Manifesto 'The Thrill of Working with Odours' 1978 Since then he showed smell paintings, mailed perfumed objects and made aromatic installations; he also created spray performances where he sprayed a mist of fragrance over the audience.Hermans, Ivan.

Together with Charles Fran√ßois he was a pioneer using a computer connected to a modem for artistic communication (in 1989). He also applied reproduction media such as Microfilm, CD-ROM and DVD-ROM for artistic reasons. Performance works One of his performance works from the 1980s was documented in the artists' periodical Force Mental. The performance took place in the venue Il Ventuno in Hasselt, and is described as follows: \\"Guy Bleus wears a costume made of official stamps of 1/2fr. He cuts his moustache into a Hitler-moustache. Against the wall he hangs photocopies of Hitler's head. Enlargements whereby the moustache is growing bigger (till A3 format). Bleus sticks then stamps, the same as of which his costume is made of and stamps them with his number-stamp: 42.292. Then he sticks a naked girl full with stamps of 1/2fr and stamps them with the number stamp. Finally he cuts off his Hitler-moustache and breaks a mirror.\\"Force Mental, nr. 14, Dec. 1986, p. 507 Another fascinating performance of Bleus is called 'Value Shredder' (1982, Brussels, Gallery Entr'Act). Bleus took hundreds of real 50 Belgian franc banknotes and made a suit out of them. Wearing this suit he began his performance. He gave the audience plastic raincoats to put on and asked them to hand over their identity cards. He put the cards into a paper shredder, then tore up Mein Kampf and threw the pages into the shredder too. When everything was completely shredded he blew odours and flour over the public with a fan. Finally, he removed his suit and set it on fire. After the performance the public received an identity card from planet Mars. A life-size photo of Bleus's money suit is part of the art collection of the National Bank of Belgium (NBB).Verhaeren, Nele.

It has five divisions: EDiS Building Systems, EDiS, Asset Management Alliance, EDiS Development, and EDiS Interiors. Originally formed in 1908, as a stonemason contractor, EDiS is considered one of the first construction management firms in Delaware. History  As master stonemasons, Ernesto DiSabatino and his sons stayed busy with tunnel projects in the Abruzzo region of Italy. In 1905, Ernesto and his eldest two sons, Arthur and Clarence were constructing the Simplon Tunnel in the Alps along the Switzerland border. After failing his army physical because of a misdiagnosis of tuberculosis, Arthur along with brother Clarence encouraged their father Ernesto to emigrate to America as new opportunities for a better life were available. With initial hesitation, Ernesto agreed that immigration to America was best for the family. The family had a sponsor in Little Italy, Wilmington, Luigi Pedicone, and when the DiSabatino family arrived in 1906 they immediately picked up work as stonemasons. At that time bricklayers earned $3 for 1,000 bricks laid. Ernesto and sons Arthur and Clarence worked 12 hours a day, six days a week as master stonemasons. By January 1907, the remaining family emigrated to Wilmington, Delaware, including wife Angela Dea and the remaining DiSabatino children. Ernesto settled quickly and within 15 months of his arrival established Ernest DiSabatino and Sons in 1908. Originally started as a masonry contracting company-quality construction by skilled tradesmen became the principals for EDiS. In 1917, the company moved to their first office at 415 Lincoln Street and through hard work became a leader in the construction field and the community. One of the best known projects at this time was St. Anthony of Padua Church, a Little Italy landmark which was completed in 1926. Ernesto DiSabatino later received the Papal Cross of Honor Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice in honor of his work in starting the parish and erecting the church. Around the same time was the completion of St. Francis Hospital in 1925, the hospital was located in Little Italy, the area where Ernesto originally settled. After the death of Ernesto in 1932 at the age of 67, the business was left in the hands of his four sons, Arthur, Clarence, Dominick and Paul. War era With the third generation of the company serving in the war, this time period is considered to be one of the most challenging times in the company‚Äôs history. Eugene DiSabatino, an engineer, worked on the Manhattan Project that produced the nuclear bomb. During World War II, the company helped major corporations convert their factories for wartime production while also assisting the government with defense and housing projects. Post-war era The Baby Boomer generation proved to be a success in the eyes of top management as EDiS was commissioned to build numerous schools for the growing children population in Delaware. Even today, education remains a large market for EDiS. The DuPont family became a customer for EDiS with the construction of the Nemours building and the Edgemoor Plant in the late 1930s. November 14, 1963 marked the dedication for the Delaware Service plaza, a project EDiS managed. On hand for the dedication was President John F. Kennedy; it was his last public statement on a public works project as his assassination was a week later. 2000s The developments of the Wilmington Riverfront lead to the construction and renovation of many prominent buildings on the Christina River. Notable projects such as the Riverfront Market, ING Direct and Harry‚Äôs Seafood Grill are all EDiS star projects. Another notable project completed in 2002 was the New Castle County Courthouse. The company built the $137 million, 572,000 sq. ft., 14 story building over 3-1/2 years and serves as a landmark in the Wilmington skyline. In 2009, EDiS partnered with Peninsula Compost to develop the Wilmington Organic Recycling Center; the first high volume, consistently viable and logistically feasible opportunity to divert food waste for the purpose of recycling in the Mid Atlantic region.

She played a significant role in the Double-Cross System, particularly by deceiving the Germans about the location of the D-Day landings. Early life Sergueiew was born in Saint Petersburg, Russia (niece of General Yevgeny Miller–°–æ–±–∞—á—å–µ —Å–µ—Ä–¥—Ü–µ –∏ –¥–≤–æ–π–Ω–æ–π –æ–±–º–∞–Ω), but her family fled to France following the Russian Revolution in 1917. She was educated in Paris, and trained as a journalist, being fluent in English, French and German. During the mid-1930s she travelled extensively throughout Germany, and once interviewed Hermann G√∂ring. WWII An attempt was made to recruit her by the German intelligence service in 1937, but she refused. However, after the fall of France she agreed to work for the Abwehr. Her case officer, Major Emil Kliemann, trained her in intelligence gathering and communications techniques, and in 1943 she travelled to Spain, taking her beloved dog Frisson with her. Sergueiew promptly contacted the MI5 representative in Madrid and reported herself as a German spy and offered to work for British Intelligence. She was accepted, and travelled to England. Unfortunately British quarantine regulations meant that Frisson was left behind at Gibraltar. Sergueiew was given the code-name \\"Treasure\\" and handled by MI5 officer Mary Sherer. \\"Treasure\\" turned out to be an effective agent, but was also described as \\"exceptionally temperamental and troublesome\\". She revealed her role as a double agent to her American boyfriend, and threatened to quit unless MI5 arranged for her dog to be brought from Spain. Matters came to a head in May 1944 when \\"Treasure\\" learned that Frisson had died. She informed MI5 that she had a secret signal, which would indicate to Kliemann that she was under British control, and threatened to use it in revenge for the death of her dog. After a tumultuous meeting with Colonel T. A. Robertson, head of the section responsible for control of the Double Cross agents, she eventually revealed the secret code. \\"Treasure\\" continued to work for MI5, sending the Germans false information until a week after D-Day, when she was informed that her services were no longer required. However, MI5 continued transmitting messages from her for another five months. Perhaps the most important part of her work was that her long messages were re-encrypted in the German Enigma machines. This provided Bletchley Park with excellent cribs for the Cryptanalysis of the Enigma used by other Abwehr networks. Sergueiew returned to France in late 1944, where she served in the French Women's Army Service. Later life After the war she wrote a revealing memoir, describing her former MI5 employers as \\"gangsters\\". Her memoirs, entitled Secret Service Rendered, were eventually published in 1968. While she was serving as a Russian language interpreter for Major John Barton Collings, the two fell in love and were married in Paris in 1946. At that time Collings was serving as the Military Governor of Erfurt, Germany, with responsibility for relocating the survivors of nearby Buchenwald, many of whom were Russians. Later they moved to Solon Township, MI, where Nathalie died on 17 May 1950 from kidney failure.Obituary ‚Äì http://www.reynolds- jonkhoff.com/obituaries/John-Collings/#!/Obituary References 1912 births 1950 deaths Abwehr Double-Cross System French people of Russian descent People from Saint Petersburg Imperial Russian emigrants to France Imperial Russian emigrants to the United States World War II spies for Germany World War II spies for the United Kingdom ","title":"Nathalie Sergueiew"},{"id":"32753752","text":"Sir Reader William Bullard (5 December 1885 ‚Äì 24 May 1976) was a British diplomat and author.

They were concerned about the influence of Fazlollah Zahedi, the general in charge of the Persian forces in the Isfahan area, who, their intelligence told them, was stockpiling grain, liaising with German agents, and preparing an uprising. Baillon and Bullard asked Maclean to remove Zahidi alive and without creating a fuss, and so he did so. (Zahedi spent the rest of the war in British Palestine; five years later he was back in charge of the military of southern Persia, by 1953 he was prime minister.) In 1951, Bullard became Director of the Institute of Colonial Studies in Oxford. In 1953, he became a member of the governing body of School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), University of London.

Towards the end of his life he lived in Plantation Road, North Oxford. Bullard's papers have been archived by St Antony's College, Oxford. He was on the governing body of Abingdon School from 1951-1955. Works Bullard published a number of books, including Britain and the Middle East (Hutchinson, 1951) and his autobiography The Camels Must Go: An Autobiography (Faber, 1961).

He served as vice rector of Mountain View, California, and established the Catholic parish of Kwun Tong, Hong Kong, and the local Catholic school whose buildings hosted the parish church. Early life Krumpelmann was born on January 30, 1909 in Saint Paul, Minnesota. He graduated from St. Thomas Military Academy in St. Paul in 1926, with training in electrical and mechanical engineering, then entered University of Minnesota in 1927. He stayed in University of Minnesota for only three years and went to work. In January 1931, he began his studies at the Nazareth Hall Seminary. Subsequently, he entered Maryknoll on August 1, 1934, and studied at The Venard, Bedford, and Maryknoll Seminary. He was ordained to priesthood on June 22, 1941. Until his studies away from St Paul, he had been a parishioner in the Church of St Mark. Missionary Servicemen's Guide's Association at Fenwick Pier in Hong Kong Fenwick Pier in Hong Kong Servicemen's Guide at Fenwick Pier in Hong Kong, where Fr Krumpelmann served as chaplain =Diocese of Kongmoon= Together with Fathers Warren Brennan, Winkels, and Sibert, Krumpelmann arrived in Hong Kong on October 15, 1941 aboard the Pan-Am Clipper from Manila. He was immediately sent to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Jiangmen in the city of Kongmoon. He stayed in China throughout the Second World War. Among the many missionary work, medical care is an important category of aid the Maryknoll Fathers provided to those in need. This was no exception in China, and medical aid was part of Krumpelmann's job and a tool for his preaching. Krumpelmann was much praised for his ability to offer medical assistance when there was no medical practitioner available on the spot to help. Jean-Paul Wiest recorded that ‚ÄúFr Krumplemann went on a mission trip 50 miles up the road and the barber of the town said to him, ‚ÄòMy son has gone crazy, he is only 15 years old. We have got him tied up.‚Äô So Fr Krumpelmann gave the kid one grain of santonin with one grain of calomel which was a purgative. In three or four days the child was all cured. Of course the father was delighted and the story went around the village and the neighbourhood, and the promotion of that accidental cure was worth hundreds of hours of preaching.‚Äù =Vice Rector of Mountain View= Shortly after the war ended, Krumpelmann suffered from tuberculosis, and had to return to the United States in April 1947. He continued to serve as a Maryknoll priest after his return to the States, and was Vice Rector at Mountain View between 1949 and 1958. =Founding the parish of Kwun Tong= In 1958, Krumpelmann was assigned by the Maryknoll to Hong Kong. After having seen Kowloontsai (now Tai Hang Tung) transformed into a thriving, well- established, active Parish and Centre, Bishop Frederick A. Donaghy, Maryknoll‚Äôs Regional Superior of Hong Kong and Taiwan, asked Fr Peter Alphonsus Reilly and Fr Krumpelmann in 1959 to found a new parish in the then government planned satellite industrial town, Kwun Tong. They rented a room on in the then new Housing Society public housing on Ngau Tau Kok Road called Garden Estate, organized catechists and catechumenates, and obtained government approval for a new clinic. For two years, Fr Reilly and Fr Krumpelmann lived in a cramped single, tiny room adjacent to the clinic in the first housing estate on Ngau Tau Kok Road and so developed a strong bond of friendship, respect and mutual understanding with the residents of the apartment blocks. This eventually turned into St John the Baptist Parish of Kwun Tong in June 1962. In 1959 Fr Krumplemann, aware of the demand for medical service in the poor neighbourhood, asked for assistance of the Maryknoll Sisters in running a clinic in the Kwun Tong area. He hoped the Sisters‚Äô clinic would replace the existing one managed by the Fr Reilly and himself. In Nov 1959, Sister Monica Marie Boyle and Sister Helen Kenny opened the clinic in Room number 1, first floor of Orchid House. The local Precious Blood Sisters once helped them with their initial needs. While the Hong Kong Government had planned to erect factories and housing for 300,000 people in that area, the government requested the clinic to provide emergency treatment to injured workers in factory accidents. In 1960, the clinic moved to Lily House. The address was Catholic Mission Clinic, Maryknoll Sisters, Ground Floor, Lily House, 293 Ngau Tau Kok Road. As more people moved into Kwun Tong, the problems Fr Krumpelmann faced increased. One of the key problems was education for the children. Solace and comfort sprang from plans for the building of a large 24-classroom school with living quarters on Yee On Street. Within two years, all formalities with the Hong Kong Government, the Education Department, the Crown Land, the designers and the contractors were completed, thus Fr Krumplemann founded St John the Baptist School (morning session of the school became St John the Baptist Catholic Primary School in Kowloon Bay) together with Fr Reilly in Kwun Tong. Shortly before the present building of St John the Baptist Church at the junction of Yee On Street and Tung Ming Street was completed, the chapel in Orchid House was temporarily moved to 1/F of Hing Tat Mansion, 336-351 Yee On Street. St John the Baptist Parish initially covered all of Kwun Tong, and was subdivided into three parishes in 1967. Both the parish and the school were established to meet demands caused by the rapid population growth of Kwun Tong in the 1950s and 1960s. =Later service in Hong Kong= Kai Liu is a resettlement estate in Kwun Tong in Kowloon, Hong Kong about fifteen-minute walk from St John the Baptist School, The Maryknoll Fathers negotiated with the government for the entire ground floor and two wings of Block 18 and launched various programmes immediately. Fr Krumpelmann, assembled and built a huge bread baking unit, that he had obtained from an aircraft carrier about to be scrapped. Fr Krumpelmann also built a complicated noodle making machine. Thousands of people weekly received bread and noodles. A clinic, well equipped with a mountain of medicine obtained by Fr Krumpelmann was opened and managed with superior efficiency. A sewing, tailoring and dress-making school with sewing machines was opened to hundreds of eager female youngsters. Fashion shows were staged long before the modern trend in leading hotels. Relief programmes were carried out with regularity and order. A large nursery for children of working parents was equipped, opened and managed by the Maryknoll Sisters who were working with zealous cooperation in all parochial welfare and educational programmes. The Maryknoll Sisters also opened in schools in Kai Liu, called Holy Spirit School and Our Lady of China Primary School. Kai Liu has been re-developed and is today called Tsui Ping Estate. Between 1966 and 1975, Krumpelmann worked as Auxiliary Chaplain in the Servicemen's Guides' Association, an organisation which supported United States Navy servicemen in Hong Kong founded by Father George Gilligan and a committee of American businessmen in Fenwick Street Pier, Wanchai, Hong Kong in 1953. In a report he wrote to the Stanley House, headquarters of Maryknoll in Hong Kong, he reported that since 1965, 2488 American Navy ships had come to Hong Kong carrying well over a million servicemen. He had offered more than 1,000 Sunday Masses on the ships. Fr Krumpelmann became the last Maryknoll Father to serve the pier when he died in 1975; since then, an Irish Jesuit in Hong Kong has taken over. Death A monument in Maryknoll Secondary School in Hong Kong dedicated to Fr Krumpelmann and others who died for God In early 1975, Krumpelmann suffered from a blood clot in his left lung and returned to the U.S. on March 31. His condition improved in the following two months, but deteriorated suddenly in late June. He died shortly after his admission to Hennepin General Hospital (now Hennepin County Medical Center) in Minneapolis on June 23. Krumpelmann's body was transported to the Maryknoll headquarters in New York, and was buried in the Maryknoll Cemetery on June 26, 1975. According to the Maryknoll Hong Kong Chronicle that in November 1975, \\"the fruits of Fr Krumpelmann's efforts before his death, 62 tons of medical supplies, arrived on the USS Niagara Falls with the cooperation of Operation Hanclasp. The supplies were handed over to the St. Paul's Hospital Sisters in a simple ceremony on board the ship, with officials from the American Consulate and the US Navy present.\\" References External links * In Memoriam of Fr.

On February 28, 2003, McKinley participated in the world's first telerobotic-assisted surgery, conducted at two hospitals separated by 400 kilometres. He later served as an aquanaut on the joint NASA-NOAA NEEMO 7 underwater exploration mission in October 2004, where he and other aquanauts tested remote health care procedures with potential application for space travel. McKinley experienced problems with alcohol and faced legal difficulties beginning in 2009. He lost his hospital privileges in 2011 and died in 2013. Early life and education McKinley was born in Shelburne, Nova Scotia, Canada. He grew up in Eastern Canada, living in several different communities throughout the Maritimes. McKinley attended the University of New Brunswick where he obtained a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering, graduating with honors. Under a full National Science and Engineering Research Council postgraduate scholarship, he obtained a Master of Science in Biomedical Engineering from the University of New Brunswick, graduating with honors. He then attended the University of Toronto where he obtained his Medical Doctorate with honor standing. Following his MD, he entered the General Surgical Fellowship training program at the University of Toronto where he graduated as the class valedictorian. McKinley received numerous undergraduate and postgraduate scholarships including five National Science and Engineering Research Council grants. Medical career McKinley was formerly Faculty Staff at The Centre for Minimal Access Surgery (CMAS) at St. Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton in Hamilton, Ontario, and was an Assistant Professor at McMaster University in Hamilton. He was the North Bay program director of the University of Ottawa's Northern Ontario General Surgery Residency Program and developed a fellowship-training program in Advanced Laparoscopic Surgery in North Bay. McKinley sat on the Advanced Laparoscopic Surgery Committee of the Canadian Association of General Surgeons. After entering private practice in North Bay in 1999, McKinley's main interest was the development of an advanced laparoscopic surgery program at the North Bay General Hospital. He was recognized as an expert in the feasibility of advanced laparoscopic surgery in a community hospital setting. McKinley published numerous peer-reviewed articles. His interests included the fields of telementored surgery, robotic surgery, and telerobotic surgery. McKinley was experienced at integrating these technologies into clinical practice. On February 28, 2003, McKinley participated in the world's first telerobotic- assisted surgery conducted at two hospitals. Dr. Mehran Anvari, the founder of CMAS, used a telerobotic system at St. Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton to operate a camera and surgical tools in the operating room at North Bay General Hospital, almost 400 km away. Anvari's hand, wrist and finger movements were transmitted from Hamilton to North Bay to control the camera and instruments. McKinley positioned the instruments in North Bay and controlled the electrocautery energy source. The two doctors successfully completed a laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication surgery on a patient named Claudette Fortier. Aquanaut McKinley practicing a suturing technique inside the Aquarius habitat. In October 2004, McKinley, a recreational diver, became an aquanaut through his participation in the joint NASA-NOAA, NEEMO 7 (NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations) project, an exploration research mission held in Aquarius, the world's only undersea research laboratory. McKinley was the Canadian Space Agency's co-principal investigator for NEEMO 7, along with Mehran Anvari. During the mission, McKinley wrote: \\"It is difficult to explain what it is like living in an underwater habitat... when something passes by our windows, it is not a bird but rather a fish. And when we leave our home, we don't go for a walk but rather a swim. It must be as strange for the fish as it is for us!\\" During the NEEMO 7 mission, McKinley and the other aquanauts tested remote health care procedures on a patient simulator in cooperation with CMAS. From thousands of miles away at St. Joseph's Healthcare in Hamilton, Dr. Anvari and other doctors guided the aquanauts as they performed surgeries on a patient simulator. Doctors in Hamilton also remotely controlled robotic instruments to do the work. The techniques simulated during NEEMO 7 can be used in remote settings on Earth, and may one day be used to respond to emergencies on the International Space Station, the moon, or Mars. The procedures simulated during the mission included ultrasound diagnosis, abscess drainage and a kidney stone extraction. Legal troubles In April 2009, McKinley was arrested in North Bay, Ontario on assault charges. In September 2010 McKinley pleaded guilty to a criminal charge of drunk driving in Parry Sound, Ontario, on November 12, 2008. On April 8, 2009, McKinley was arrested in North Bay by detectives in the Investigative Section of the North Bay Police Service. He was charged with eight counts of assault, criminal harassment and uttering threats. On August 4, 2010, McKinley failed to stop for police on the highway between Parry Sound and Sudbury, Ontario. The Ontario Provincial Police called off their pursuit when McKinley, driving a Porsche, reached a speed of over 200 km/hour. He was arrested several hours later and spent three days in custody. McKinley pleaded guilty to a provincial offence for this incident in September 2010, at the same time he pleaded guilty to drunk driving, and agreed to pay nearly $10,000 in fines and a charitable donation. He was also placed on probation for a year. From August 20, 2010, to April 13, 2011, McKinley was suspended from practicing medicine by an executive committee with the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario. During this period McKinley, who was experiencing problems with alcohol, received treatment at the Homewood Health Centre in Guelph, Ontario, which specializes in addiction treatment. In January 2011, McKinley was arrested for violating a bail condition and obstructing justice by attempting to dissuade a witness from giving evidence. He later admitted to sending the witness two e-mails on January 8, 2011, threatening her with a public mischief charge and suggesting he would endanger her job by complaining to the organization overseeing her profession. He also urged her to make the Crown's office withdraw a complaint against him. However, the same month McKinley's assault charges were stayed by Superior Court Justice Paul Rivard because the district Crown's office had prejudiced his right to a fair trial. The Crown's office could not show it had responded to seven written requests from McKinley's lawyer to disclose evidence on the assault charges. In May 2011 he was placed on probation for obstructing justice. He also lost his hospital privileges in Ontario. Craig McKinley died suddenly on February 18, 2013.  Family  Craig McKinley was the son of Joseph Garland McKinley and Carol Ann Hartlen. McKinley was the brother of Michelle Dana McClare and James Andrew McKinley. He had two daughters with spouse Susan Hegge, Samantha Donna- Anne McKinley and Jessica Doris-Jean McKinley.

It is a Grade I listed building. The existing building dates mostly from the 13th‚Äì15th centuries, but notable survivals from the Anglo- Saxon period indicate a church has stood on this site since at least the 8th century AD. It was restored in 1820, then in 1870 by Sir Gilbert Scott. Description Anglo-Saxon coffin lid on the north wall The church is notable for its Anglo-Saxon carvings, and a large Anglo-Saxon coffin lid which was discovered under the chancel floor near the sanctuary in 1820. It is now mounted on the north wall of the nave. It appears to date from the second half of the 7th century. The church is also noted for containing an Anglo-Saxon carving of a lead miner, \\"T'owd Man\\", the oldest representation of a miner anywhere in the world. It was moved here in 1863 from Bonsall church for safe- keeping and has never been returned. The parishioners of Bonsall have had a replica carved for their church.The Matlock Mercury, 20 February 2002 The church also contains numerous early medieval and medieval carvings, many fragments of larger pieces, that have been grouped together and inserted for display in the transept walls. These include fragments of early medieval stone crosses and medieval grave slabs, figures of a wise man and shepherd, and the face of a bearded man. It is one of the few remaining churches in Britain which still performs the ancient custom of clipping the church. This takes place on the first Sunday after 8 September, the Sunday after the Feast of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The nave roof was replaced in 2020, following leaks which threatened to damage the church interior. A traditional topping off ceremony was held with the Bishop of Derby on 18 August 2020. Th' owd Man, the oldest known representation of a miner Memorials In the north aisle are the tombs of the Gell family. Sir Anthony Gell (d. 1583) has his statue on his tomb.

Following an open beta phase, the game was released for Microsoft Windows in October 2013. A version for Xbox One was released in August 2017, and a PlayStation 4 version was released in March 2019.  Gameplay  The player controls a single character from an overhead perspective and explores large outdoor areas and caves or dungeons, battling monsters and fulfilling quests from non-player characters (NPCs) to gain experience points and equipment. The game borrows heavily from the Diablo series, particularly Diablo II. All areas aside from the central encampments are randomly generated for increased re-playability. While all players on a single server can freely mingle in encampments, gameplay outside of encampments is highly instanced, providing every player or party with an isolated map to freely explore. Players can choose from seven available classes to play as (Duelist, Marauder, Ranger, Scion, Shadow, Templar and Witch). Each of these classes are aligned with one or two of the three core attributes: Strength, Dexterity, or Intelligence. The exception is the Scion, formerly a locked prestige class released in 2013, which is aligned with all three attributes. The different classes are not restricted from investing into skills not aligned with their core attributes, but will have easier access to skills that are aligned with their core attributes. Items are randomly generated from a wide variety of basic types and endowed with special properties and gem sockets. They come in different rarities with increasingly powerful properties. This makes a large part of gameplay dedicated to finding well-balanced and synergistic equipment. Skill gems can be placed in gem sockets of armor, weapons and some types of rings, giving them an active skill. As the character advances and levels up, the equipped skill gems also gain experience, allowing the skills themselves to level up and increase in potency. Active skills can be modified by items known as Support Gems. Depending upon the number of linked sockets the player possesses, a primary attack or skill can be modified with increased attack speed, faster projectiles, multiple projectiles, chaining hits, life leech, auto-cast spells on critical strike, and more. Given limits on the number of sockets, players must prioritize gem usage. All classes share the same selection of 1,325 passive skills, from which the player can choose one each time their character levels up, and as an occasional quest reward. These passive skills improve the core attributes and grant further enhancements such as increased Mana, Health, damage, defenses, regeneration, speed, and more. Each one of the characters start on a different position on the passive skill tree. The passive skill tree is arranged in a complex network starting in separate trunks for each class (aligned with the permutations of the three core attributes). The player must therefore not only focus on maximizing all modifiers related to his primary offense and defense, but must also take care to select the most efficient path through the passive skill tree. As of the 3.0 Fall of Oriath Release, the maximum possible number of passive skill points was 123 (99 from leveling and 24 from quest rewards). Each class also has access to an Ascendancy class, which grants much stronger, specialized bonuses. Each class has three Ascendancy classes to choose from, except for the Scion, who only has one Ascendancy class that combines the elements of all other Ascendancy classes. Up to 8 Ascendancy skill points can be assigned out of 12 or 14. Path of Exile is unusual among action role-playing games in that there is no in- game currency. The game's economy is based on bartering \\"currency items.\\" Unlike traditional game currencies, these items have their own inherent uses (such as upgrading an item's rarity level, rerolling affixes, or improving an item's quality) and thus provide their own money sinks to prevent inflation. Most of these items are used to modify and upgrade equipment, though some identify items, create portals to town or grant skill refund points. = Leagues = The game offers several alternate play modes. The following permanent leagues are available: * Standard ‚Äì The default gameplay league. Characters who die here respawn in the last city visited (with experience loss at higher levels). * Hardcore (HC) ‚Äì Characters cannot be resurrected but instead respawn back in the Standard league. This mode is analogous to permadeath in other games. * Solo Self Found (SSF) ‚Äì Characters cannot join a party with other players, and may not trade with other players. This type of gameplay forces characters to find or craft their own items. Current temporary (challenge) leagues: * The Heist league. Other leagues are usually designed for specific events. They have their own set of rules, item accessibility and aftermath. These rules widely vary depending on the league. For example, timed \\"Descent\\" league features another map set, new monster sets and rewards, but characters in this league are no longer available for playing after the league ends. \\"Turbo solo immolation\\" leagues, as another example, are running on the same maps as standard modes, but with much harder monsters, no partying, replacing physical damage with fire damage and monsters exploding on death‚Äîand return the survivors to Hardcore league (while dead characters resurrect in Standard). Racing leagues last between 30 minutes and 1 week. The permanent leagues have counterpart ladder leagues with different rulesets that last three months.  Setting  The game is set in a dark fantasy world. The player starts the game waking up on the shores of Wraeclast, a continent that once was the center of a mighty empire but is now a cursed land which serves as a penal colony for criminals and other unwanted individuals from the nearby Island of Oriath. Regardless of the reasons for their exile, the player must now face the unforgiving wilderness and its dangerous inhabitants amidst the crumbling ruins and bloody secrets of the Eternal Empire and the Vaal civilization that came before, and band together with other exiles to survive.  Development  Path of Exile began when a small group of action role- playing game enthusiasts became frustrated by the lack of new releases in the genre and decided to develop their own game. It was developed under the radar for three years before being publicly announced on 1 September 2010. In the time since then, Grinding Gear Games has published a number of development posts on their website ranging from screen shots of new classes, monsters, and skills to presentations of game play or technical aspects. Alpha started around June 2010, and ended when 0.9.0 was released in August 2011. Following a period under closed beta which players could pay to join, the developers started an open beta on 23 January 2013 which was free to play with purchasable microtransactions. The game was patched for release version 1.0.0 on 23 October 2013. On this date, it was also made available on Steam. The game continues to be updated with new content and fixes on roughly a monthly basis. = Expansions = Sacrifice of the Vaal (version 1.1) Path of Exiles first digital expansion, Sacrifice of the Vaal, was released on 5 March 2014. The expansion included new bosses, currency, areas, leagues, and PvP modes. Forsaken Masters (version 1.2) The second expansion, Forsaken Masters, was announced on 31 July 2014 and released on 20 August 2014 at 3pm Pacific. It comes with a host of new features, including crafting, recruitable NPCs called Masters (who remain at the player's hideout offering them daily training missions and specialized items), reworked passive skill tree, and customized personal hideouts. version 1.3 The version introduce new temporary leagues: Torment and Bloodlines to the game which later added as core mechanics. The patch also further improve PVP and introduces PVP master Leo. The Awakening (version 2.0) The Awakening,, entered closed beta on 20 April 2015. It includes the addition of a fourth Act containing new map tilesets, quests, and monsters. Other additions include new skills and items, passive skill tree sockets and jewels, item filters, two new challenge leagues, and game balance. The expansion also added an optional \\"Lockstep\\" mode in an effort to fix the desync network synchronization issues at the cost of latency. The Awakening expansion was released on 10 July 2015. version 2.1 The version introduced a new temporary league: Talisman to the game which later added as a core mechanic. Ascendancy (version 2.2) The Ascendancy expansion pack was released on 4 March 2016. Including more than the usual new items and skills, the expansion added several new skills and 19 new ascendancy classes. This expansion was also timed to be made live at the same time as the Perandus Challenge Leagues. The ascendancy classes are each tied to one of the base classes, with three ascendancy classes for each base class, except the Scion which only has one ascendancy class. Each of these new classes will contain its own unique ascendancy skill tree to advance. These new skill trees are much smaller than the base classes full-blown passive trees, but provide a unique specification to one's class not previously seen in the game. An example is the ascendant Necromancer skill tree, which would allow a witch's summoned minions to release chaos-damage explosions on death, increase the effect of auras, or increase spectres' health and damage. version 2.3 The version introduce new temporary leagues: Prophecy to the game which later added as a core mechanic. It also introduced the Endgame Labyrinth as well as other minor features. Atlas of Worlds (version 2.4) An expansion, titled Atlas of Worlds, was released on 2 September 2016. It introduced a new end-game, 30 new maps and 19 new bosses. version 2.5 and 2.6 Version 2.5 introduced new temporary league: Breach to the game which later added as a core mechanic. It also introduced other minor new features. In 2.6 the game did not have new features but a flash back league Legacy. Fall of Oriath (version 3.0) The Fall of Oriath expansion was released on 4 August 2017. The expansion adds six new acts and was the largest expansion released to date. The expansion replaced cruel and merciless difficulties with Acts V-X. A new Character Selection Screen was added. A help panel has been created for players to use as well as eight new Vaal side areas with new bosses. There is also a new passive skill tree planning system. There are three new skill gems and numerous support gems added as well. 24 new unique items have been added, five of them being designed by supporters of the game. The areas of the first five acts are revisited with changes to the environment that were the result of the players' actions. The Pantheon system has also been added, where a player can obtain interchangeable buffs from boss gods found in the new content. War for the Atlas (version 3.1 to 3.4) The War for the Atlas expansion was revealed on 16 November 2017, and released on 8 December 2017. It focused on overhauling the Atlas of Worlds, adding 32 new maps, as well as other new items. After War for the Atlas (which also introduced the Abyss mechanics), the leagues Bestiary, Incursion and the Delve had introduced new mechanics to the game. They became permanent mechanics in the Betrayal expansion. Betrayal (version 3.5) The Betrayal expansion and league was revealed on 13 November 2018, and was released on 7 December 2018. The Betrayal expansion offered a rework of in- game systems: the Master, crafting system as well as other content. Version 3.6 to 3.8 In February 2019, on top of the announcement of Synthesis league, it was announced that the Syndicate that was introduced in Betrayal league, had become permanent mechanics as well. The Synthesis league launched on 8 March 2019, which introduced new type of in-game loots called fractured item and synthesized item. New lore was also introduced. The Legion expansion and league was revealed on 21 May 2019, and released on 7 June 2019. The Legion expansion includes a major overhaul of melee combat skills, and the league introduced new in-game mechanics as well as a new map the Domain of Timeless Conflict. In August 2019, the September expansion of the game was announced, which included another temporary league Blight, as well as the implantation of the previous leagues Synthesis and Legion into the core game. The September expansion also included rework of the character classes such as Necromancer and other change. Blight league was themed tower defense. Conquerors of the Atlas (version 3.9) During ExileCon, Grinding Gear Games announced the 3.9 expansion, to be released in December 2019. ExileCon was held in New Zealand in November 2019, it also announced the sequel of the game Path of Exile 2, which previously known for its working title Path of Exile 4.0, to be released in 2020 (or later). The 3.9 expansion was known as Conquerors of the Atlas, which overhauled the end-game system. It also shipped with bow attacks rebalance and new bow skills. At the same time the temporary league of 3.9 would be Metamorph. Delirium (version 3.10) In February of 2020, the Delirium mini-expansion and temporary league were announced, with a planned launch date of 13 March. Delirium will add 4 new skill gems, 3 new support gems and 13 new unique items. Harvest (version 3.11) In June of 2020, the Harvest temporary league was announced, with a planned launch date of 19 June. Harvest adds a new NPC named Oshabi who is cultivating the Sacred Grove where you plant seeds, grow them into monsters and kill them for crafting and life-force. The league powerful new crafting options, eight new skills, two new support gems, revamps of Two-handed Weapons, Warcry skills, Brands, Slams and the Passive Skill Tree itself. We've also introduced 12 new unique items and rebalanced over 50 existing ones. Heist (version 3.12) In September of 2020, the Heist league was announced with a planned launch date of 18 September. Heist contains the Heist challenge league, nine new Skills and Support Gems, revamps of Curses, Steel Skills, and some Spells. Grand Heists offer exclusive new rewards such as Weapon and Body Armour Enchantments, Heist Trinkets, Alternate-quality Gems and Replica Unique Items. During this league you will hire skilled thieves to help you pull off risky Heists. Steal valuable artifacts to fund and train your crew as you plan towards the execution of a Grand Heist. = Mobile version = Also during Exilecon in November 2019, Grinding Gear Games announced that a version of the game for mobile devices was also in development within their studio. One of the main topics discussed in the reveal video was the current trend in free-to-play mobile business models (such as \\"pay-to-win microtransactions, time gates, energy bars, random nag screens, notifications, video ads\\") and that POE Mobile would aim to avoid that approach, and retain the full gameplay of the desktop version. However, it was also stated that the mobile version was \\"experimental\\" and that continued development will be dependent upon the feedback from fans. = Graphic Rendering = The game started with DirectX graphic rendering which supports a wide array of video cards. During Delirium league, February 2020, Grinding Gear Games (GGG) released a beta support version of Vulkan graphic rendering with the goal of providing more consistent game play and to collect feedback from players to improve the new mode through bug reports. Vulkan support implementation provided a smoother experience, reducing the amount of times the games frames-per-second would drop or bottom out during high intensity game play. Vulkan beta support continued into Harvest with updates at the start of the league but negatively affected performance. Another release late into the Harvest league with 300+ changes that affects both DirectX and Vulkan beta support are still waiting for feedback. = Code Refactoring = In September 2020 through patch 3.11.2, Grinding Gear Games released a substantial code quality refactoring which required a full game download to deploy. The release includes: optimized future game patching for stand-alone and Steam game store versions, game file storage which improves HDD game load time, compressed and sharper texture quality, audio quality improvements, graphic engine improvements, a first-ever Apple macOS version release and Epic Game Store version release.  Business model  The developers of Path of Exile stress that one of their core goals is to provide a genuinely free-to-play game financed only by \\"ethical micro-transactions\\". Players can create multiple accounts and even have more than one logged in at a time. Path of Exile mainly offers cosmetic item skins for players willing to spend money on the game, but it does also gate specific account features such as semi-automated public trading inventories or additional character slots behind a paywall. It is also possible for players to pay to create private, invite-only leagues, each secluded in its own economy. On 18 January 2017, Grinding Gear Games announced they would be expanding into the console market. During closed beta, by 21 January 2013, Path of Exile received US$2.2m in crowd-sourced contributions.  Reception  Path of Exile was named 2013 PC Game of the Year by GameSpot, and best PC role-playing game of 2013 by IGN. By February 2014, the game had five million registered players. In 2020, it won the award for \\"Best Evolving Game\\" at the 16th British Academy Games Awards.  Sequel  In November 2019, Grinding Gear Games announced the sequel, Path of Exile 2 during their Exilecon. Previously known as Path of Exile 4.0.0 (working title), the sequel introduced a new 7 act storyline campaign with a major overhaul of the engine and gameplay. However, both Path of Exile and Path of Exile 2 share the same game client and end-game system, leaving the player a choice to play the Path of Exile or the sequel campaigns before reaching the end-game. Players can also interact with each other regardless of their choice of campaign. A Beta version of Path of Exile 2 is expected to release in \\"very late\\" 2020.

K. (1996 ). Cognitive planning. New Delhi: Sage Publications. challenges g-theory on the grounds that the brain is made up of interdependent, but separate, functional systems. Neuroimaging studies and clinical studies of individuals with brain lesions make it clear that the brain is modularized; for example, damage to a very specific area of the left temporal lobe will impair the production (but not the comprehension) of spoken and written language. Damage to an adjacent area will have the opposite impact, preserving the individual's ability to produce, but not understand speech and text.  Description  Based on A. R. Luria's (1966) work on modularization of brain function, and supported by decades of neuroimaging research, the PASS Theory of Intelligence proposes that cognition is organized in three systems and four processes. The first process is Planning, which involves executive functions responsible for controlling and organizing behavior, selecting and constructing strategies, and monitoring performance. The second is the Attention process, responsible for maintaining arousal levels and alertness, and ensuring focus on relevant stimuli. The two processes, Simultaneous Processing and Successive Processing encode, transform, and retain information. Simultaneous processing is engaged for determination of the relationship between items integration into whole units of information is required. Examples of this include recognizing figures, such as a triangle within a circle vs. a circle within a triangle. Successive processing is required for organizing separate items in a sequence such as remembering a sequence of words or actions exactly in the order in which they had just been presented. These four processes are hypothesized to functions of four areas of the brain. Planning is broadly located in the front part of our brains, the frontal lobe. Attention and arousal are combined functions of the frontal lobe and the lower parts of the cortex, although the parietal lobes are also involved in attention as well. Simultaneous processing and Successive processing occur in the posterior region or the back of the brain. Simultaneous processing is broadly associated with the occipital and the parietal lobes while Successive processing is broadly associated with the frontal-temporal lobes. The PASS (Planning/Attention/Simultaneous/Successive) theory is heavily indebted to both Luria (1966, 1973), and studies in cognitive psychology involved in promoting a different look at intelligence.  Assessment of PASS processes  300px The PASS theory provides the theoretical framework for a measurement instrument called the Das-Naglieri Cognitive Assessment System (CAS), published in 1997.Naglieri, J, A., & Das, J. P. (1997). Das-Naglieri Cognitive Assessment System. Itasca, IL: Riverside Publishing. This test, now in a Second Edition (CAS2; 2014, Naglieri, Das & Goldstein) is designed to provide an assessment of intellectual functioning redefined as four brain-based cognitive processes (Planning, Attention, Simultaneous and Successive), providing information about cognitive strengths and weaknesses in each of the four processes. This emphasis on processes (rather than traditional abilities) is said to make it useful for differential diagnosis; diagnosing Learning disabilities and Attention Deficit Disorder, Autism, Mental Retardation, cognitive changes in aging and Down syndrome, changes due to brain impairment in Stroke and fair and equitable assessment of diverse populations. Its usefulness as a theory and measurement instrument for Planning and Decision making in management has also been demonstrated.  Links to general intelligence  Contemporary theories about intelligence can be divided into two classes, psychometric and cognitive. The quantitative approach to intelligence is better reflected in psychometric theories of which Charles Spearman's is an early example. In contrast, cognitive theories such as PASS theory are both qualitative and quantitative. Such theories advance the idea that intelligence has multiple neurocognitve processes. For example, both Robert Sternberg and Howard Gardner view intelligence as neither a single nor biologically determined factor, but as a number of domains that represent the interaction of the individual's biological predispositions with the environment and cultural context. PASS theory builds upon these principles.  Links to brain activity  The core ideas that cognitive functions can be organized in terms of broad functions of the brain received some support in a recent study (Okuhata et al.) that investigated the psychophysiological basis of two different types of information processing (simultaneous and successive). The authors, investigated EEG coherence patterns during six tasks of Das-Naglieri Cognitive Assessment System. They analyzed beta (12.5 ‚Äì 25 Hz) coherence while 18 volunteers performed three simultaneous and three successive tasks. The results revealed two significantly distinguishable coherence patterns corresponding to simultaneous and successive processing. The linking of PASS processes to brain becomes helpful, for example, in understanding the loss of sequential and planning functions due to aging in a study of individuals with Down syndrome. In this study, using single positron emission topography, Das found that aging individuals with Down syndrome show a bilateral decreased cerebral blood flow in the temporal-parietal region of the brain. The significance of cognitive profiling studies both in impaired and intact brains awaits further discussion in the broader context of the biology of intelligence.  Remediation and cognitive enhancement  One unusual property of the PASS theory of cognitive processes is that it has proven useful for both intellectual assessment (e.g. the CAS) and educational intervention. The theory provides the theoretical framework for the PASS Reading Enhancement Programme (PREP), a remediation curriculum designed to improve the planning, attention and information processing strategies that underlie reading . A related school-readiness program aims at improving the foundations of cognitive processes(COGENT) in preparation for schooling (Das, 2009). Both are evidence-based intervention programs.  Challenges  A frequently cited criticism is based on the factor analysis of the test battery. In particular, are Attention and Planning two distinct factors? Kranzler, Keith & Flanagan (2000) found only a marginal fit for the four- factor model ; the attention and planning factors were indistinguishable. recent research on intelligence tests confirm that the most valid score on, for example, the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children ‚Äì Fifth Edition (Canivez, Watkins, & Dombrowski, 2017), Stanford-Binet Fifth Edition (Canivez, 2008), Differential Abilities Scales (Canivez & McGill, 2016), and the Woodcock-Johnson Fourth Edition (Dombrowski, McGill & Canivez, 2017) is the total score that estimates g. That is, the scores which represent the factor based scales these tests provide do not have enough specific variance to be considered interpretable. In fact, a recent reanalysis of Carroll‚Äôs survey of factor-analytic studies by Benson, Beaujean, McGill, and Dombrowski (2018) concluded that nearly all of the specified abilities presented by Carroll ‚Äúhave little-to-no interpretive relevance above and beyond that of general intelligence (p. 1028).‚Äù The only exception to these finding is research reported by Canivez (2011) regarding the Cognitive Assessment System (Naglieri & Das, 1997).

In the first months of 1491 he was elected Patriarch of Constantinople with the support of the monks of Mount Athos. On his election he changed his name to Maximus, an unparalleled case in the history of the Ecumenical Patriarchate because usually a monastic name is maintained throughout an ecclesiastic career. As Patriarch he defended the rights of Orthodox Christians living in territories under the Venetian Republic. During his reign arose some pieces of gossip about him, not specified by the sources, which led to his deposition in early 1497.

In 2001‚Äì02 Woolf was awarded a Senior Fellowship at the Harvard Kennedy School's Center for Business and Government. While at Harvard, she wrote a book on attracting investment in electricity transmission systems: Global Transmission Expansion: Recipes for Success (2003). Woolf is an Honorary Bencher of Middle Temple, a life position which recognises contributions to the legal profession. = Livery companies = Woolf is associated with several livery companies. She is a Court Assistant and past Master of the Solicitors', the Master of the Plumbers' and Court Assistant of the Wax Chandlers' companies, and an Honorary Court Assistant of the Worshipful Company of Builders Merchants. She is also a liveryman of the Arbitrators' company. She is an Honorary Liveryman of The Turners, the Fuellers, Lightmongers, Security Professionals, Tax Advisers and Paviors companies. = Presidency of the Law Society = Woolf served as president of the Law Society of England and Wales for 2006‚Äì07. In her valedictory speech on stepping down, she said that in her year as President she had met with \\"98 of the top 100 firms and another 25 or so beyond that\\". She was \\"delighted to have met with so many top firms...they had a huge number of ideas about what we should be doing for them\\". = Lord Mayor of London = On 29 September 2013, she was elected as Lord Mayor of London, only the second time in its 800-year history that a woman has held this office. She succeeded Sir Roger Gifford as Lord Mayor on 8 November 2013 during the annual \\"Silent Ceremony\\" at the Guildhall. The City's second female Lord Mayor, following Dame Mary Donaldson (Lord Mayor 1983‚Äì84), Woolf was interviewed by Cathy Newman for a Daily Telegraph profile article, taking the opportunity to promote one of her mayoral campaigning themes, namely the furtherance of women in executive careers and the correction of the traditional imbalance between the sexes in senior City positions. She sponsored a Long Finance initiative during her year as Lord Mayor, \\"Financing Tomorrow's Cities\\", which examined new mechanisms for funding sustainability. She made regular media appearances about the Lord Mayor's role in welcoming the world to London, and ventured onto a catwalk at the Old Bailey during London Fashion Week. = Other = She was the Chancellor of the University of Law 2014‚Äì2018.

Woolf was appointed Deputy Lieutenant of Greater London, in March 2016. She is a Trustee of the Science Museum and Honorary President of the Aldersgate Group = Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse = On 5 September 2014 it was announced that Woolf would chair the independent panel inquiry that would examine how the UK's institutions have handled their duties to protect children from sexual abuse. On 21 October 2014, Woolf disclosed that she lived in the same London street as Lord Brittan and had invited the Conservative peer and his wife, Diana Brittan, to dinner on three occasions. Lord Brittan had been Home Secretary in 1984 when ministers were handed a dossier on alleged high-profile paedophiles; he has insisted that the proper procedures were followed. In total, she had dined with Lord Brittan and his family five times since 2008, and also had joined Lady Brittan for coffee on a \\"small number of occasions\\". Woolf further disclosed that she had been involved in the past with bodies with which the Brittans had also had involvement. The BBC reported that survivors of child abuse were increasingly concerned about her apparent links to Lord Brittan, and Labour MP Simon Danczuk, who campaigned for the inquiry, said he thought Woolf should resign. Woolf made the disclosures to MPs ahead of her appearance before the Home Affairs Select Committee, saying she was aware of \\"speculation gaining traction on social media\\" about her links with the Brittans and she wanted to: :go the extra distance to make sure I have dug out every possible connection with someone who is essentially one of thousands of people I know in the City. [‚Ä¶] Do I have a close association with them (the Brittans)? the answer is no. Let us remind ourselves that this is not an inquiry about Lord Brittan but about hundreds of institutions and frankly thousands of systemic failures. On 22 October, the BBC reported that it had seen a judicial review application launched by a victim of historical child sexual abuse which challenged the choice of Woolf as the chair of this inquiry on the basis that she was not impartial, had no relevant expertise and might not have time to discharge her duties. The judicial review hearing could have been held before the end of 2014. On 31 October 2014, she resigned her chairmanship of the panel.  Honours  * 50px DBE (2015) - CBE, 2002 * 50px DStJ (2013) - SSStJ, 2010; Woolf was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for \\"services to the U.K. Knowledge Economy and Invisible Earnings\\" in 2002 and Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2015 New Year Honours for \\"services to the legal profession, diversity, and the City of London\\", in recognition of her longstanding commitments in public life.

With a key location near the oil fields, the town changed hands more than once during the Second Sudanese Civil War (1983-2005). In April 2011 the town was once again the scene of conflict between militia and government troops. Location Mankien is in Mayom County, to the southwest of Mayom. Mankien is mainly inhabited by Bul Nuer people. The town lies within the Block 4 oil concession. Civil war In March 1998, Major General Paulino Matiep announced the formation of his South Sudan Unity Army (SSUA) based in Mankien, with Bul Nuer boys and men armed by the government. By mid-1998, Unity State was experiencing pre-famine conditions due to the disruption of the civil war. In December 1998 the World Food Program delivered its first shipment of food for four months to Mankien. In July 1999 SSDN Commander Tito Biel, who had been given ammunition by the SPLA, launched an attack on Paulino Matiep's forces and pushed them back almost to their headquarters in Mankien. This was interpreted as a struggle between different pro-government militias over who would control the oil fields. In September 1999 Commander Peter Gatdet defected from the government and took control of Mankien and its supplies of arms and ammunition. There were reports that the government of Sudan was bombing Mankien towards the end of that month. Civilians were killed or injured, including some who had fled from Mayom. The government refused aid workers flight access to the town, indicating that they had lost control. Renewed bombings were reported in March 2000. In April 2000 the town was controlled still by Peter Gatdet. Khartoum launched an offensive of several hundred Baggara horsemen supported by artillery, gunships and Antonovs. Peter Gadet managed to repel the government forces. In January 2002 Mankien was controlled by the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) and had a large population of displaced people. The government began an offensive of high- altitude bombing from Antonov's, causing random casualties to the civilians. Before dawn on 27 January 2002 government troops and militias attacked the town, supported by helicopter gunships. There were many casualties and the town was destroyed. In May 2002 the SPLA lost Mankien to the Paulino Matiep's militia. Later events After the civil war, a team found that 4% of people around Mankien were blind, and almost 8% more had poor vision, mainly due to untreated diseases such as Trachoma. In April 2011 the town was briefly occupied by forces loyal to the renegade general Peter Gadet before being re- taken by troops of the SPLA. A spokesman for Peter Gadet said the fight was only with the SPLA, and no civilians would be harmed. After further fighting in May 2011, when Peter's forces attacked Mankien from his home village of Ruadnyibol, the Mayom county commissioner said that about 7,800 huts had been burned. While reporting on mine clearance operations around Mankien, the project manager for Norwegian People's Aid said \\"Unity State remains one of the most contaminated states in South Sudan, with a high number of Dangerous Areas, several minefields and a high number of abandoned ordnance contaminating huge areas of land\\".

The school building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012. Architecture The original architect of this Second Empire style house was possibly Isaac Hobbs, the architect of the Dollar Savings Bank on Fourth Avenue in Pittsburgh. Hobbs and Henry J. Lynch worked closely together when Lynch sat on the bank's board of directors from 1864 to 1906. The house was added to the List of City of Pittsburgh historic designations on August 20, 1982, and the List of Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation Historic Landmarks in 1984. The mansion has 21 rooms, stained-glass windows, 14-foot-high tin ceilings and carved corbels. History The Ursuline Sisters raised the money to buy the building for a school in the 1890s, and then defended the school's independence against the Diocese of Pittsburgh and it Bishop Phelan. They made a number of additions to the original structure, including an auditorium/dormitory, chapel, and a dining hall. They sold the building in the early 1990s.

Shows the extent of the lake highlighted on a map. It is on the Ivanhoe River in the James Bay drainage basin and is located southwest of Foleyet on Ontario Highway 101. The lake is substantially encompassed by Ivanhoe Lake Provincial Park, except for some private cottages at the northeast end of the lake. The lake is known as Pishkanogami in the Anishinaabe language, and was once the site of Pishkanogami Post, a Hudson's Bay Company trading post. It was renamed Ivanhoe Lake in 1960. Hydrology There are four islands in the lake: First island, Second island, Hinton Island, and Klose Island; and one shoal, Hastle Shoal, located northeast of Second Island). The primary inflow is the Ivanhoe River at the southwest tip of the lake; other named inflows are (left and right tributaries vis-√†-vis the Ivanhoe River inflow and outflow) Jackpine Creek (left), Hellyer Creek (left) and Gullystone Creek (right). The primary outflow is the Ivanhoe River (New Channel) at the northeast of the lake, controlled by the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources-operated Ivanhoe Lake Dam, a barrage dam to regulate the water level on the lake and headwaters storage for hydroelectric generating stations further downstream in the drainage basin. A secondary outflow is the Ivanhoe River (Old Channel) at the northwest of the lake. Both channels recombine further downstream as the Ivanhoe River, which flows via the Groundhog River, Mattagami River and Moose River to James Bay. The lake is known for its very large sandy shoal beach along the east side of the lake at Ivanhoe Lake Provincial Park. The shoal beach was created by erosion since the lake level was reduced when the esker washed out in 1918. Due to the large shallow area the water temperature at the beach can be very comfortable during summer months. Transportation The lake can be accessed by road from Highway 101, and private floatplane services are offered by Air Ivanhoe from their main base on the lake. Marine fuel and boat rentals are available from Red Pine Wilderness Lodge. There are three boat launches available on the lake. The first is a public launch accessible of the main Ivanhoe Lake road roughly 1 km from Hwy 101. The public launch is constructed of gravel and sand and it is not completely level. It is suitable for launching and loading small boats but large boats can be difficult to load and level. The second launch is a paid launch at Redpine Lodge. The launch is constructed of concrete, is level, and suitable for all sizes of boats. The third launch is a gravel launch available inside Ivanhoe Lake Provincial Park. There is also an air strip between the northwest tip of the lake and Highway 101. The Ivanhoe Airstrip was built in the 1960s by a local lodge owner was used actively by general aviation aircraft through the 1980s. The MNR has also used the airstrip for aerial spraying in the 1990s, but that airstrip has never been maintained by the MNR. The airstrip is not formally maintained and must be used at a pilot's own risk.

Early life and education Erskine was the son of the Rev. William Erskine, episcopalian minister of Muthill, Perthshire. He was baptized at Muthill on 29 August 1768. He was educated at the University of Glasgow; while there he boarded in the house of Andrew Macdonald, episcopalian clergyman and author of Vimonda, from whom, according to Lockhart, he derived a strong passion for old English literature. Career He passed advocate at the Scottish bar on 3 July 1790, and became the close friend and literary confidant of Scott. In 1792 Erskine, with Scott and other young advocates, formed a class for the study of German. According to Scott's biographer John Gibson Lockhart, the companionship of Erskine, owing to his special accomplishments as a classical scholar and acquaintance with the \\"severe models of antiquity\\", was highly serviceable to Scott as a student of German drama and romance. Lockhart represents him as being mercilessly severe on \\"the mingled absurdities and vulgarities of German detail\\". It was Erskine who negotiated for Scott's translation of Lenore in 1796. In 1801, while in London, Erskine happened to show the volume to \\"Monk\\" Lewis, who thereupon \\"anxiously requested that Scott might be enlisted as a contributor to his miscellany entitled Tales of Wonder\\". Soon after Scott began his great career as an author, he resolved to trust to the detection of minor inaccuracies to two persons only, James Ballantyne and Erskine, the latter being \\"the referee whenever the poet hesitated about taking the advice of the zealous typographer\\". The friends joined in keeping up the delusion that Erskine and not Scott was the author of the portions of The Bridal of Triermain, and wrote a preface intended to \\"throw out the knowing ones\\". Scott dedicated to Erskine the third canto of Marmion, which was published in February 1808. Erskine was appointed sheriff depute of Orkney on 6 June 1809, and in 1814 Scott accompanied him and other friends on a voyage to Orkney. Lockhart ascribes to Erskine the critical estimate of the Waverley novels included in Scott's own notice in the Quarterly Review of Old Mortality, in answer to the sectarian attacks of Thomas M'Crie the Elder against his representation of the covenanters. By Scott's unwearied exertions on his behalf Erskine was in January 1822 promoted to the bench as Lord Kinneder. The charge against him of an improper liaison, a sex scandal with Mrs Burt, a well known prostitute from Edinburgh, so seriously affected his health and spirits that, though it was proved to be utterly groundless, he never recovered from the shock caused by the accusation.Christie's. Lot notes for the painting William Erskine, Lord Kinnedder (1756-1822) It \\"struck\\", said Scott, \\"into his heart and soul\\"; he became nerveless and despondent, was finally attacked by fever and delirium, and died on 14 August 1822. Lockhart states that he never saw Scott \\"in such a state of dejection\\" as when he accompanied him in attendance upon Kinneder's funeral. At the time George IV was paying his memorable visit to Edinburgh, and Scott, owing to his grief, plunged into the gaiety of the moment with an aching heart. \\"If ever a pure spirit quitted this vale of tears\\", wrote Sir Walter to a friend, \\"it was William Erskine's. I must turn to, and see what can be done about getting some pension for his daughters.\\" Lockhart thought that Erskine was \\"the only man in whose society Scott took great pleasure, during the more vigorous part of his life, that had neither constitution nor inclination for any of the rough bodily exercise in which he himself delighted.\\" If, as Erskine supposed, Redmond in Rokeby is meant for a portrait of himself, Lockhart must have exaggerated Erskine's effeminacy. Erskine wrote several Scottish songs.one of which is published in James Maidment's Court of Session Garland (1839), p. 110. Personal life On 13 September 1800 Kinneder married Euphemia Robison (only daughter of Professor John Robison- Physicist), who died in September 1819. She was buried in the churchyard of Saline, Fife, where there is an epitaph on her tombstone written by Scott. William Erskine's children with Euphemia Robison were: Euphemia (4 June 1801 Saline, Fife, Scotland ‚Äì 7 June 1852 Portobello, Midlothian, Scotland) m.

Dardanus made him suffer the last penalty after he had been defeated in Valencia by King of the Goths Ataulf. In all likelihood, Dardanus came from a modest background and due to his studies and abilities reached the status of a patrician (an honorary position in the Lower Empire related to the acquisition of effective status as a senator), and access to the post of prefect of the Gauls twice, probably the first time in 401-404 or 406-407 and 412-413 in a second time after the transfer in 407 of the seat of praetorian prefecture of Gaul from Augusta Treverorum (Trier) to Arelate (Arles). Dardanus was converted to Christianity and then retired to the Alps, where he began a correspondence with Jerome and Augustine of Hippo. An admirer of St. Augustine, with whom he had established a correspondence, he founded an institution called Theopolis (Greek: \\"City of God\\"). This institution was established in his domain, for which he expanded on both sides of the road leading from Sisteron to the present village of Saint-Geniez to which it gives the walls and doors.

Life Estcourt, born 7 February 1816, was the eldest son of the Rev. Edmund William Estcourt of Newntown, Wiltshire, one of the Estcourts of Estcourt, Gloucestershire. He was destined for the church; entered Exeter College, Oxford, 20 February 1834; proceeded B.A. 1838 and M.A. 1840; and came under the influence of the Tractarian movement. In 1845, when J. H. Newman went over to the church of Rome, Estcourt, then a clergyman at Cirencester, followed him, and was 'received' at Prior Park in December of that year. About three years after he was ordained catholic priest by Dr. Ullathorne, vicar-apostolic of the western district, and on the restoration of the hierarchy in 1850 he was appointed √¶conomus of the diocese. Though one of the kindest of men, he had great firmness of character. He was a great lover of books, and for many years he was a most useful member of the committee of the London Library. Suffering from a painful internal disorder, he passed the last few years of his life in retirement at Leamington, where he died on 16 April 1884. He was buried at Kenilworth. Bishop Ullathorne, in an address delivered on the occasion, pronounced a well-merited eulogy on Estcourt's 'assiduity, accuracy, punctuality, skill, and sound judgment.' His knowledge of the earlier history of the midland district was remarkable, as was also the knowledge he had acquired of property law. His generosity and charity were of the most self-denying character, and his disposition refined, modest, and unobtrusive. Works His literary abilities appear in the bestknown of his works, ‚ÄòThe Question of Anglican Ordinations discussed,‚Äô 1873. This controversial treatise by an erudite member of the Roman church, with a valuable appendix of original documents and facsimiles, appeared at a time when the vexed question of the validity of English orders was fiercely debated by members of the Anglican and Roman communions, and it attracted considerable attention (Academy, 26 April 1884). An anonymous reply to the work appeared, with the title 'Anglican Orders, a few remarks in the form of a conversation on the recent work by Canon Estcourt,' 8vo, London, 1873. An article, originally prepared by Estcourt for the 'Dublin Review,' was published separately instead, under the title, 'Dogmatic Teaching of the Book of Common Prayer on the subject of the Holy Eucharist,' 8vo. London, 1868. Estcourt left unpublished a work of considerable interest, 'The Memoir of Jane Dormer, Duchess of Feria,' the materials for which he slowly accumulated during a period of twenty-five years. The first nine chapters were completed, and materials made ready for nine more. The fragments were placed in the hands of the Rev. Joseph Stevenson, S. J., and the book appeared in 1887.

Early life Estcourt, son of Thomas Grimston Bucknall Estcourt, M.P., and younger brother of Thomas Henry Sutton Sotheron Estcourt, was born on 12 July 1802. He was educated at Harrow School, and entered the army as an ensign in the 44th regiment on 13 July 1820. Military career On 7 June 1821 he was transferred to the 43rd Monmouthshire light infantry, in which he was promoted lieutenant on 9 December 1824, and captain on 4 November 1825. He spent the next five years of his military life in Gibraltar. He returned to England and then Ireland. In 1834 he accepted the post of second in command to Colonel F. R. Chesney in the famous Euphrates Valley Expedition, and was placed in charge of the magnetic experiments. He showed himself a loyal assistant to his chief during the next two years of arduous labour and travel, and it was chiefly owing to Chesney's advocacy of his services that Estcourt was promoted major on 21 October 1836, and lieutenant-colonel by brevet on 29 March 1839. His regiment participated in the suppression of the Lower Canada Rebellion, and he was based eventually in Drummondville, Upper Canada, where, in addition to other activities as surveyor, he brought the attention of his superiors to the poor condition of the Cayuga Road. Treaty of Webster Ashburton Maine boundary dispute that led to the 1842 Webster-Ashburton Treaty. In 1837 he married Caroline, daughter of Reginald Pole-Carew, for many years Under- Secretary of State for the Home Department. On 31 March 1842 the foreign secretary, the Earl of Aberdeen, appointed him British boundary commissioner in fulfilment of article 6 of the Webster‚ÄìAshburton Treaty, which then determined the international border with the British North American colonies of New Brunswick and Lower Canada. Estcourt's instructions enjoined him not only to demarcate the line but also to examine the possibilities of defending it. He landed in Boston on 19 April 1843. The same day he met with the American boundary commissioner, Albert Smith. On 25 August 1843 he went on half-pay, on being promoted to an unattached lieutenant-colonelcy. By the end of the 1843 season most of the collaboration on the north line, from the source of the St. Croix River to the Saint John River, as well as the settling of the Saint John River boundaries, had been completed. In response to a request from him so that he might hasten progress the following year (1844), Aberdeen dispatched an additional 14 sappers from London; that year Estcourt would employ 500 foremen and axe-men. Parliamentary career In February 1848 he entered parliament as M.P. for Devizes, the family borough, but did not seek re-election in 1852. He served as a . Estcourt applied for a staff appointment in the Crimean expedition. Although he had had no experience of actual warfare, he had recently completed the demarcation of the southern border of New Brunswick, a task that had seen him direct in a harsh environment over 500 men. On 21 February 1854 he was made a brigadier-general, and appointed adjutant-general to the expeditionary force. He owed this important post to the support given to his application by his friend Lord Raglan, who believed that his polished and gentle manners concealed real strength of character. As adjutant-general he performed his duties efficiently during the weary months of waiting and sickness at Gallipoli and at Varna, and also at the battles of Alma and Inkerman. He was promoted major-general on 12 December 1854. Savage criticism The two chief staff officers, Generals Estcourt and Airey, were held by the public to be especially responsible for the sufferings of the British Army during the first winter in the Crimea; but Lord Raglan defended them in the strongest terms in his despatches of 15 January and 3 March 1855. Estcourt, like Airey, went on steadily with his work, despite adverse circumstances and savage criticism, until 21 June 1855, when he was suddenly struck down by cholera. He at first rallied, but the thunderstorm of 23 June caused a relapse, and he died on the morning of 24 June. Death His death was universally regretted. Hamley writes that he was 'a man of remarkably kind and courteous disposition', and Kinglake speaks of him as 'a man greatly loved by Lord Raglan, by all his friends at headquarters, and indeed by all who knew him'.The Invasion of the Crimea, viii. 361 Lord Raglan was afraid to attend the funeral, for fear of showing his grief; but the last visit he paid before his own death, was to Estcourt's tomb. It was announced in the 'Gazette' of 10 July 1855 that Estcourt would have been made a K.C.B. if he had survived. His widow, who had courageously spent the winter in camp, and had been by her husband's deathbed, was raised to the rank of a K.C.B.'s widow by special patent in 1856. She survived until 17 November 1886, when she died at her residence, The Priory, Tetbury, Gloucestershire.

It is a Swiss heritage site of national significance. History In 1261, the Lords of Mont planned to build a city along the lake that would compete with the Aubonne and Saint-Prex. By around 1264, Rolle Castle was built named at the time Castrum de Ruello to protect the pier at the lake. However, the planned city was never built by the Mont family. In 1291, the castle was in possession of Count Amadeus V of Savoy, who granted it to several different families as a fief. In the course of the rivalry between the Counts of Savoy and the Lords of Vaud, in 1319 Amadeus V of Savoy finally built a city around the castle, in 1330 the city was named Ruelloz. This new city closed a gap in the savoy settlements on the northern shores of Lake Geneva. During the Bernese invasion, both Le Rosey Castle and Rolle Castle were attacked and burned. Under Bernese rule (1536-1798) Rolle was part of the bailiwick of Morges. In 1558, the Bernese merchant Hans Steiger, who was already the lord of Mont-le-Grand, acquired the barony of Rolle. His family retained the property until the French Revolution. The barony included the town of Rolle (except the fief of Les Uttins which belonged until the 18th century to the La Harpe family), Tartegnin, Vinzel, Luins, half of Essertines-sur-Rolle, some homes in Begnins, the region of Vincy and Saint-Vincent (now in Gilly), Bursinel and in 1615 they acquired Le Rosey Castle, Dully and Le Vaud. The judicial court was composed of the lord, his deputy, a court clerk, and ten members from Rolle and villages in the district. One of ten members governed the city. In 1740 the town bought itself out from under some taxes and duties. Following the French invasion of Switzerland in 1798, Rolle became the seat of a district of the same name. In 1799 the Helvetic Republic bought the castle from the municipality and used it until 1974 as the seat of government. In 1802, during the Bourla-papey uprising, patrician land titles and tax records were burned in the archives at Rolle Castle.

After leading (late 1968) the Commission charged with establishing the status of professorship of music at the French Ministry of Education, he founded and lead for twenty years (1969‚Äì1989) the Department of Music of University of Paris VIII (Vincennes, and St. Denis). He was also responsible, from 1970 to 1980, for the teaching of general aesthetics at the University of Paris IV (Sorbonne). He decided to end his career by teaching philosophy at the University of Nice Sophia- Antipolis (1989‚Äì1999). When he graduated from the Paris Conservatory of Music in 1956, he participated in the GRM under the leadership of Pierre Schaeffer, and proposed to set into electronic music St√©phane Mallarm√©'s \\"Coup de d√©s\\" in Darmstadt, a project which caught the attention of Karlheinz Stockhausen.

A .30 calibre machine gun was located in each of the gulled sections of the upper wing and were synchronized to fire through the propeller arc.Forgotten Fighters p 56 The tightly-cowled 9-cylinder Pratt & Whitney R-1690C Hornet was the engine originally specified, but was changed to the 14-cylinder Wright SR-1510-92 Whirlwind before the aircraft flew. The propeller was a metal constant speed two-blade design. The original open cockpits were modified to sliding canopies shortly after delivery to the navy.

Switzer Memorial Building is a federally owned office building located at 330 C Street SW in Washington, D.C. in the United States. The Egyptian Revival structure was originally named the Railroad Retirement Board Building. It was designed by Charles Klauder and Louis A. Simon and completed on September 15, 1940. Although intended for the Railroad Retirement Board, its first occupant was to the United States Department of War. By Act of Congress, it was renamed the Mary E. Switzer Memorial Building on October 21, 1972, becoming the first federal building to be named for a woman. The Switzer Building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 6, 2007. Genesis The Railroad Retirement Board Building was first proposed in 1938 as part of a massive federal construction effort in the District of Columbia and around the country. President Franklin D. Roosevelt proposed the construction projects both as a way of providing employment to the millions of Americans out of work due to the Great Depression but also as a means of meeting the office space needs of the rapidly expanding federal government. Those needs, especially in Washington, D.C., had gone unmet for nearly a decade. On February 9, 1937, Roosevelt named an informal committee to study federal office space needs. The committee was chaired by United States Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes, and included Senator Elmer Thomas (D-Oklahoma); Representative Ross A. Collins (D-Mississippi); Rear Admiral Christian J. Peoples, United States Navy; and Frederic A. Delano, chair of the National Capital Parks and Planning Commission. The President's Special Committee on Public Buildings recommended in April 1938 construction of a new headquarters for the Railroad Retirement Board, a federal agency created in 1935 to oversee a pension system for the nation's railroad workers. President Roosevelt proposed a construction bill on May 17, 1938, in which $3 million was set aside to purchase land, design, and begin construction on a new Social Security Administration Building and a new Railroad Retirement Board Building. The 75th Congress, due to adjourn on June 16, raced to get the bill approved. By June 11, the Senate had acted on the bill. Initially, the House of Representatives stripped the $3 million appropriation from the bill. The appropriation was restored on June 16 when House members agreed to pay the funds out of the $965 million Public Works Administration (PWA) funding bill. The total cost of the two structures was now estimated at $14.25 million. The PWA bill passed Congress on June 25, 1938, (Public Law 75-723), and President Roosevelt signed it into law. =Design= Progress on construction was quite rapid. Design of the building was overseen by Louis A. Simon, the Supervising Architect in the Office of the Supervising Architect in the United States Department of the Treasury (which had oversight of all federal construction). The supervising architect was Charles Z. Klauder, a private architect who worked in a variety of styles. On July 28, 1938, Simon and Klauder presented their design for the two structures to the United States Commission of Fine Arts, which had the authority to review all new public buildings erected in the District of Columbia. Klauder designed back-to-back buildings, with the Social Security structure facing Independence Avenue SW and the Railroad Retirement building facing C Street SW. Because of the need to provide a great deal of interior light via windows, Klauder proposed a \\"fishbone\\" structure: A long central corridor from which five short, narrow wings projected on both the north and south sides. The overall length of the building was , and it had elements of both Streamline Moderne and Egyptian Revival in its facade. Klauder also proposed an alternative treatment of the building. He suggested making the three central wings look like pylons from the street, each with a low base. All the wings would have high windows, set apart with deep reveals. Pilasters high topped by non-load bearing lintels would help screen the bays created by the wings. The entire two-building structure would have a uniform cornice line, be five stories tall, have a limestone facade, and have of internal space (of which the railroad building had ). A two-story penthouse contained mechanical and HVAC systems. The commission was greatly pleased by Klauder's alternative treatment, and approved it on July 28, 1939. Detailed architectural and engineering designs were immediately begun. By November 1938, the cost of the two buildings had fallen to $10.815 million. Construction Construction of the two buildings proved very important to the District of Columbia. Prior to 1939, most federal office buildings were clustered in Federal Triangle or areas close to the White House. The District's building boom was driven in great part by the needs of the United States Department of War, which was adding tens of thousands of workers. Roosevelt had adopted a policy of mobilization, to prepare the nation for possible entry into World War II. But most military officers and upper-level civilian workers lived in Northwest Washington and the Virginia counties across the Potomac River from it. To ensure that these tens of thousands of War Department workers could get to their jobs quickly and easily, War Department office buildings were planned for the northwest section of the city. This left no room for the Social Security and Railroad Retirement Board buildings in that part of town. Because workers for the Social Security Administration and the Railroad Retirement Board were low-wage workers without an urgent need to get to their jobs in a timely fashion, the Social Security and Railroad Retirement Board buildings were deliberately sited in Southwest Washington. This started a trend of federal construction of office buildings in Southwest Washington, leading to the creation of Southwest Federal Center. The Railroad Retirement Board Building and the Social Security Administration Building were the first federal office buildings constructed in Southwest D.C. =Construction speed-up and defense assignment= Construction on the two structures began in May 1939. Both the American Federation of Labor (AFL) and the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) agreed not to strike contractors working on the two buildings. By July 1939, the cost of the two buildings was estimated to be $12 million. The foundations were complete by the end of the year, and President Roosevelt proposed in January 1940 to spend $3.25 million to continue work on the structures in coming year to reach a planned January 1, 1941, opening date. However, by June 1940, the space shortage affecting the War Department was so acute that PWA officials began speeding up construction on the Railroad Retirement Board Building. Already, rumors were swirling around Washington that the War Department, not the retirement board, would occupy the structure. These rumors proved true on June 20, 1940, when the PWA announced that the War Department was now slated to occupy both structures. Congress initially appropriated an extra $100,000 to pay for overtime and accelerated purchase of construction costs. An additional $400,000 was appropriated to further speed construction. The talks with contractors over speeding up construction proved effective, and the new deadline for completion of both buildings was fall of 1940. Agencies scheduled to take up residency in the two buildings included the National Defense Advisory Commission (an informal body established in June 1940 to promote the conversion of industry to a wartime footing), the Army Quartermaster Corps, the Army Corps of Engineers, and other War Department units. Despite these moves, the original names of the buildings remained attached to each. To handle the massive influx of military workers, city officials began working with the Capital Traction Company and the private companies providing public bus service to plan new streetcar and bus lines to serve the structures. Only a single major accident was reported during the building's construction. On July 4, 1940, 43-year-old construction worker Roy Trowbridge suffered a fractured spine when scaffolding he was standing on gave way and he fell four stories to the ground. By early July, the $14 million buildings were due to be completed by September 1, 1940. =Strikes= Despite the earlier pledge by AFL and CIO officials to not strike war-related construction, strikes plagued the work on the two buildings in the summer of 1940. The first strike occurred when 250 workers at the Smoot Sand & Gravel walked out to protest a job classification by the federal Wage and Hour Division. The men worked on barges dredging gravel, and wanted to be classified as seamen so they could qualify for overtime and work more than the federally approved 42-hour work week. The strike began on July 9, lasted five days, and idled more than 6,500 workers (including those working on the Social Security and Railroad Retirement Board buildings) as no concrete could be delivered. The men won reclassification as seamen, a 10 percent wage increase, and pay for five days they were idle. A second strike hit the construction site on July 18. This jurisdictional strike involved 250 carpenters, who were involved in a dispute with the plasterers over who had the right to build sawhorses. More than 2,000 of the 3,000 workers on the two-building job site were idled as the strike continued. The strike ended on July 19 after both labor unions agreed to allow the Building and Construction Trades Department (BCTD) of the AFL to arbitrate the dispute. A third strike hit the site on August 2. This jurisdictional strike involved 180 plasterers and cement finishers, who walked off the job in a dispute over who would install more than of acoustic ceiling tile. The strike didn't idle many workers, just 60 lathers and plasterers' assistants. The Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service was called in to mediate the dispute. The strike received front-page coverage in The Washington Post. AFL officials denounced the strike, calling it an illegal wildcat strike. Deputy Secretary of Labor Daniel W. Tracy (president of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers from 1933 to 1940), and BCTD President John P. Coyne personally intervened in the negotiations to bring them to a swift conclusion. The strike ended on August 8 after a special representative from National Defense Advisory Commissioner Sidney Hillman also intervened. In the past, the carpenters performed 50 percent of all acoustic tile work, with the bricklayers and plasterers installing 25 percent of the tile. Under the new agreement, the three unions shared equally in the work. Because the acoustic tile wasn't due to be installed yet, the strike created no real delay in the work. A fourth jurisdictional dispute also threatened to disrupt work at the site. Bricklayers and glaziers both wanted to install structural glass in each building's lavatories. But, to the relief of federal officials, no strike ever occurred. =Completion= The Railroad Retirement Board Building was completed on September 15, 1940. Three floors of the Social Security Administration Building were finished on October 1, and the rest of the structure on November 1. The total cost of construction for both was $14.25 million. Due to the large number of employees to be housed in the two structures, more than 1,800 telephone lines had to be installed. To accommodate the lines, the Department of War had to have its own telephone exchange (REpublic 6700) assigned to it for the first time. The two buildings were joined by a tunnel, and each had special loading docks to speed deliveries to them. To air condition the buildings, seven cooling units were purchased from the Carrier Corporation and installed on-site. The two buildings were among the first in buildings in the District of Columbia to feature air conditioning, acoustic ceiling tile, and fluorescent lighting. The Quartermaster Corps occupied the Railroad Retirement Board Building on October 2, 1940, and the Corps of Engineers moved into its quarters in December 1940. After the end of World War II, the Railroad Retirement Board Building was turned over to the United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. The building was colloquially known as \\"HEW-South\\". Renaming Mary E. Switzer On October 16, 1971, Mary E. Switzer died. Switzer became director of the Office of Vocational Rehabilitation in the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare in 1950 and the first administrator of HEW's Social and Rehabilitation Service in 1967. She retired in 1970 as the highest ranking female bureaucrat in the federal government. In December 1971, Senator Hubert H. Humphrey (D-Minnesota) introduced legislation in the Senate to have the Railroad Retirement Board Building renamed in honor of Switzer. On October 21, 1972, President Richard Nixon signed Public Law 92-520 into law. Section 26 of the law redesignated the Railroad Retirement Board Building as the \\"Mary Switzer Memorial Building\\". The structure was formally rededicated on January 16, 1973. It was the first federal building to be named for a woman. On July 6, 2007, the Switzer Building was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Renovations By 2002, three agencies occupied space in the Switzer Building. The United States Department of Education took up 60 percent of its space, while the United States Department of Health and Human Services had 30 percent and the Broadcasting Board of Governors (the body which governs the Voice of America and other U.S. government broadcasting bodies) had the remainder. In 2002, the General Services Administration announced an $81.7 million renovation of the Switzer Building. HNTB, an architectural and engineering firm, was selected to oversee the upgrades. Construction was scheduled to begin in early 2005, and proceed in two phases. Phase I would renovate half the building and end in early 2007. Phase II would renovate the other half, and be complete in summer 2008. Renovations included an entirely new HVAC system, fire suppression system, and emergency electrical power plant; replacement of all electrical wiring and plumbing; a new telecommunications system; security upgrades; and refurbishment of the main lobby. Because modern mechanical and HVAC equipment was much smaller than the units it replaced, the two-story mechanical penthouse was reclaimed and converted into office space. Phase II of the project began in July 2009. Another of mechanical space was reclaimed in the sixth and seventh floors (the former two-story mechanical penthouse), the elevator shafts extended to the two topmost stories, and new elevators installed. Windows throughout the building were replaced with modern energy-efficient ones, and a green roof placed atop the structure. While construction continued, the Switzer Building served as the headquarters for the second inauguration of George W. Bush. In April 2014, the General Services Administration said it would spend $10.38 million to renovate the Switzer Building into open workspace. This would allow 1,627 employees in five HHS divisions to move into the structure. The agencies scheduled to move into the Switzer building after the renovation are the Administration for Children and Families, the Administration for Community Living, the Departmental Appeals Board, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health and the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology.

It arises from two headwaters, the Menzenschwander Alb and Bernauer Alb and flows in a southerly direction. It ends after (including Menzenschwander Alb) at a confluence with the High Rhine at Albbruck.  Etymology  The name Alb is possibly derived from a Proto-Indo-European word *albhos meaning \\"white\\" or perhaps \\"river\\".  Headwaters  The headwaters of the Menzenschwander Alb lie on the southern slope of the Feldberg mountain range in the Landkreis of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald. The Bernauer Alb rises on the southern slope of the Herzogenhorn. The Menzenschwander Alb is about long and flows south-east past Menzenschwand. The Bernauer Alb is about long; it also flows south-east, past Bernau. The confluence of the two headwaters is at Glashofs√§ge, about from Sankt Blasien. The valleys of both headwaters were widened by glaciers during the ice age. Both are about high and dominated by grassland. The Bernau valley is a broad basin, characterized by moraines, marshy valleys, ravines, and Roche moutonn√©es. The hamlets and isolated farms that make up the valley lie some distance above the frost-prone valley floor. The glacial features in the Menzenschwand valley are even more striking. The Menzenschwander Kluse is a well-known terminal moraine. Below the Kluse, the Menzenschwand Alb plunges with several waterfalls through a small ravine to a basin created by the former Krunkelbach valley glacier.  Middle reaches  The area occupied by the municipality of Sankt Blasien's area is dominated by the classicist dome of Sankt Blasien's Cathedral. Below the village centre, the Alb form a waterall, locally known as , after the Roman town of Tusculum. The Alb, like most rivers in this part of the Black Forest, then changes its course by about 60 degrees, towards the south. This is thought to be caused by tectonic movements of the Earth's crust, which have increased the gradient to the High Rhine. The only valley that continues in a south-eastern direction is about higher, in the saddle near H√§usern. During the ice age, the Alb glacier was about high in this area, and its meltwater overflowed the H√§usern saddle, into the Schwarza valley. Below this bend, the Alb water is collected in a reservoir, the Alb Basin. Its average surface area is ; it is impounded by a dam of about in length. Most of the water is piped to the Schwarzabruck reservoir. Both reservoirs are owned by the Schluchseewerk AG. The Alb then flows through a wide valley, lined by meadows, which contains the villages of Schlageter and Immeneich. The valley is no longer bordered by narrow, wooded ridges, but instead by the undulating Hotzenwald plateau in the municipalities of Dachsberg und H√∂chenschwand. The plateau is indented by bogs and rocky hilltops. During the W√ºrm ice age, the Alb glacier ended at the point where we now find the village of Niederm√ºhle. With a length of , the Alb glacier was the longest in the Black Forest. Downstream of Niederm√ºhle, the valley is very narrow, leaving no room for settlements.  Alb Gorge  Teufelsk√ºche, a giant's kettle in the Alb valley The slope of the Alps increased greatly in the ravines and the river forces its way through the more canyon-like passages and blocked sections known as the (\\"Devil's Kitchen\\"). The Ibach and H√∂llbach join from the right, each emerging from its own narrow gorge. The H√∂llbach has two waterfalls in this area. Because the gorge is so narrow, the road is up to higher, on the left bank. On a wider spot in the valley, is the saw mill Tiefenstein and two tributaries, Schildbach and Steinbach. Halfway up the slope, there are granite quarries and the ruins of two castles. The narrowest and most dangerous passage begins downstream of Tiefenstein. Long ago, the Alb followed a different course and flowed to Hauenstein through the valley now occupied by the M√ºhlbach. This route was blocked by glacial deposits during an earlier ice age, forcing the Alb to find a new route to the Rhine. Since then, the \\"new\\" gorge cuts through the granite rock. This section cannot be travelled without special equipment, even though the water flow is usually low, because most of the water has been diverted. It there is sufficient water, canoeing is possible, although this is considered the most difficult stretch of whitewater in Germany.Josef Haas: Wildwasserperlen, Constance, 1980, p. 25 In this section the road runs up to above the river and passes through five short tunnels drilled through the cliffs, giving it the nickname \\"Axenstra√üe of the Black Forest\\". From the hamlet Hohenfels, the road descends to the valley floor at Albbruck, where the Alb flows into the High Rhine.

It formed on February 6, 1994, in the central Indian Ocean in the southern hemisphere. The cyclone moved southwestward for much of its duration, striking Mauritius on February 10 at peak intensity with winds of 218 km/h (135 mph). It later passed just southeast of R√©union before turning to the south and weakening. The cyclone became extratropical on February 14 in the southern Indian Ocean. On Mauritius, Hollanda destroyed or severely damaged 450 houses, which left at least 1,500 people homeless. High winds left half of the island without power, and also caused severe crop damage; nearly half of the island's sugar crop was destroyed, which necessitated for the government to assist in replanting efforts. Hollanda killed 2 people and caused $135 million in damage on Mauritius. About a week after the cyclone struck, Cyclone Ivy also affected the area, although to a lesser degree. The highest rainfall from the cyclone fell on R√©union, with recorded at Grand Coude. Meteorological history Based on analysis from M√©t√©o-France (MFR), a disturbance in the Indian Ocean intertropical convergence zone became evident south of the Chagos Archipelago on February 6, after Cyclone Geralda struck Madagascar and moved away from the region. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) assessed it as developing a day prior in the same general area. Later on February 6, a circulation developed concurrently with an area of organized convection. On February 8, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Hollanda as it moved southwestward, its motion influenced by a ridge to its south. A trough turned the storm to the south-southwest, and Hollanda intensified into a tropical cyclone ‚Äì the equivalence of a hurricane ‚Äì on February 9. After becoming a tropical cyclone, Hollanda developed a small eye as it tracked toward the island of Mauritius, located east of Madagascar. Continuing to intensify, the cyclone struck the northern coast of the island at 1800 UTC on February 10 at peak intensity, with winds of 155 km/h (100 mph) (10 minute sustained winds) as assessed by MFR. In addition, the cyclone produced gusts to . At the same time, the JTWC estimated peak winds of 195 km/h (120 mph) (1 minute sustained winds). While moving over Mauritius, the eye became disrupted, although Hollanda maintained much of its intensity as it passed just southeast of R√©union early on February 11. The cyclone remained well- defined as it moved more poleward, and an irregular eye remained visible on satellite imagery. On February 13, Hollanda turned eastward due to a trough, and the next day it became extratropical over the southern Indian Ocean. Its remnants persisted at least two more days. Impact Before Hollanda struck Mauritius, most people were already residing at home, due to the cyclone striking during the Chinese New Year. Officials closed the airport prior to the cyclone's arrival, and most stores and banks were also closed. Officials also ordered for cars to be off the roads during the storm and for people to remain indoors. Forecasters initially expected the storm would remain slightly offshore. Ultimately, Cyclone Hollanda made landfall at peak intensity, producing wind gusts of in Mauritius's capital city of Port Louis. Strong winds affected the northern and western portions of the island, particularly near the coast, and the cyclone was considered the worst to hit there since Cyclone Gervaise in 1975. In addition to the winds, the storm dropped torrential rainfall that reached in Mare aux Vacoas. Across the island, Hollanda destroyed 290 houses and severely damaged another 160, which left at least 1,500 people homeless. Included among the damaged buildings was the Russian embassy, which faced such difficulties making repairs that the ambassadors moved their offices. Damage to schools was estimated at 25 million rupees ($1.3 million 1994 USD), causing some to be closed for as long as 12 days. High winds downed 30% of the island's trees. Many fell onto power lines, which left 60% of Mauritians without power and about half without telephone service. All external communications were cut to the country during the cyclone. In addition, nearly half of the sugar plantations were destroyed, although the primary industry of tourism was not significantly affected. In total, the cyclone killed two people, and left $135 million in damage (1994 USD); the total included lost productivity, such as decreased sugar output. Less than a week after Hollanda struck, Cyclone Ivy also hit Mauritius, although to a lesser extent than Hollanda. The combined impact caused most roads to be blocked by either fallen trees or mudslides; all main roads were quickly restored. Following the storm's passage, the Mauritius government opened 130 shelters, and also provided 5,000 rupees to each homeless family. The crop damage from Hollanda, in addition to a drought, decreased the following year's output by 22%. In response, the government provided seeds to farmers so they could replant their crops. Most of the island had their power restored by ten days after the storm. The country's prime minister issued an appeal to the European Union for 67 million rupees ($3.6 million 1994 USD) in assistance, although later dropped it to less than half that total. The requested aid was for the restoration of phone and power utilities. The storm's severe impact on Mauritius caused a sharp drop in the country's gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, and the overall GDP decreased by 10%. Although the cyclone did not strike the island of R√©union, Hollanda produced strong wind gusts that peaked at in Sainte-Rose. Rainfall on the island peaked at at Grand Coude. The cyclone left damage to crops, power systems, telephones, and the water network, mostly due to the strong winds.

Mall history First opened in 1975, the Orange Park Mall is the largest mall on the west side of the St. Johns River in the Jacksonville area. The mall contains over 110 stores and services. When it opened, it featured three anchors: Ivey's, May Cohen's, and Sears, like Volusia Mall a year before. In 1984, the mall added that included a new food court and a JCPenney anchor. May Cohen's became May Florida shortly before being acquired by Maison Blanche in June 1988. Ivey's changed to Dillard's in June 1990. Maison Blanche was in turn taken over by Gayfers in early 1992 due to Mercantile Stores buying the chain. In 1997, the mall built a 24-screen AMC Theatres. Gayfers finally ended up as Belk in late 1998 because Mercantile was bought out by Dillard's which already had a store at the mall. Later, in 2006, the mall added a Dick's Sporting Goods anchor.

Cabase was a singer, songwriter, musical director, computer musician, instrumentalist of at least 28 musical instruments, arranger, conductor, bandleader and musical director.Philippine Music Registry He is also known to his fans as Manny Cabase in the Philippines and/or Mahnee Cabase in the USA. Cabase is the father of the nationally known singer, author, actress, Amapola. Cabase's music is now included in the new Jose R. Gullas Halad Museum in Cebu City. The Halad Museum opened its doors and honoring Cabase and other awardees February 02, 2010 Early life Cabase was born in San Nicolas, Cebu City, to Roman Catholic parents, Sonsa (n√©e Kabajar) and Ireneo Cabase. His father was an accordionist and a traveling musician with a Vaudeville group. Cabase was a child prodigy, learning to play piano on his own at 5 and learning guitar at age 6. Attending academic schools halted his self-education but at age 13 he was a guitarist, vocalist, and arranger for the local band of San Nicolas. Music career In 1935 at the age of 15, Cabase became a member of the Cebu Swingmasters with his equally talented brothers Narding and Siux. His rapidly developing talents not only as a performer but as composer and arranger launched Cabase to the position of Bandleader at only 17 years of age. In 1945, Cabase married his best friend, Priscilla Campogan at the end of the Japanese Occupation. Cabase organized the group Music Makers, together with his brother Siux. When the Music Makers disbanded, Cabase founded The Three Kings, which eventually evolved into the popular Vikings featuring Visayan singing stars: Stacs Huguete, Ramonito Del Rosario, Maning Aballe, and Art Maloy. The group disbanded in 1962. In 1963, Cabase founded The Sounds, a group of singing musicians and starred his daughter Amapola. He eventually turned over the leadership of the group to his daughter, and under his guidance, Amapola and the Sounds became the country‚Äôs biggest musical sensation. In 1972 his daughter Amapola joined a road tour of Hawaii, followed in 1973 by a stint at the Carlyle Hotel for the Philippines First Lady Imelda Marcos. With Amapola‚Äôs career firmly entrenched in the United States, Cabase and his wife, Sheila, joined their daughter and their group reunited at the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco from 1977 to 1982.

She was best known for designing the Harlequin eyeglass frame. Early life Altina Schinasi was the youngest child born to the Schinasi family. She was born at the Schinasi residence at 351 Riverside Drive (West 107th Street) on Manhattan's Upper West Side on August 4, 1907.Schinasi, p. 6 After being tutored at home, Altina attended Horace Mann and at the age of twelve left home to board at Dana Hall School in Wellesley, Massachusetts.Schinasi, p. 38 Altina's mother took Altina and her sister to Paris shortly after her graduation from Dana Hall. There, Altina studied painting with her cousin, Ren√© Bensussan. While spending more time with Bensussan, she developed a deeper appreciation for art, and as a result, Altina chose to attend art school rather than college when she returned to the states. In New York, Altina studied with Samuel Halpert at the Roerich Museum.Schinasi, p. 88 Her father, Morris Schinasi, was a Sephardic Jew born in Manisa, Turkey. Altina's mother, Laurette Schinasi n√©e Ben Rubi, the granddaughter of Schinasi's business associate Joseph Ben Rubi, was a native of Salonica, then in the Ottoman Empire. Upon Morris Schinasi's death in 1928, his widow Laurette Schinasi traveled to Manisa, Turkey to establish Moris Sinasi √áocuk Hastahanesi, or Moris Sinasi Children's Hospital in the city of her late husband's birth. It remains in operation today. Philosophy  ‚ÄúI painted for the joy of it‚Äìbecause it‚Äôs what I love to do. For me, art is fun. I like to make things. I‚Äôve always liked to make things. If I couldn‚Äôt draw it and paint it, then I‚Äôd make a pillow or I‚Äôd make a quilt or I‚Äôd make something. I always had to make something and I was always looking for ideas for projects. I wanted to use my art to enrich my life.‚ÄùSchinasi, p. 246-7 Window dresser Altina took a job with Peter Copeland designing windows for Fifth Avenue stores. It was in this job that she found herself working alongside Salvador Dal√≠, who had been commissioned to design two Bonwit Teller windows. Altina worked in the Copeland workshop to build the windows that Dal√≠ designed. George Grosz, a German artist that Altina had long admired, settled in New York after fleeing Hitler's regime in 1932. Though he taught intermittently on the faculty of the Art Students League, Altina, now in her twenties and a divorced mother of two, studied with Grosz at the school that Grosz set up with painter Maurice Sterne. In Grosz‚Äô classes, Altina again encountered Salvador Dal√≠ who came to make use of the model.Schinasi, p. 177 Harlequin glasses frame Though she would continue to register patents for inventions until late in life, Schinasi's breakthrough came early on when she created and marketed the Harlequin eyeglass frame that defined glamour in the late 1930s. A walk down the street occasioned this design breakthrough; finding herself underwhelmed by the lackluster frames in an optician's window, Altina set out to create a frame that conveyed whimsy, mystery and romance. ‚ÄúSurely, there must be some way to design eyeglasses that could be attractive! What looks good on a face? What adds to a face? What could a woman wear on her face that would be romantic?‚Äù she wondered. Altina settled on the Harlequin mask as a starting point and began to cut masks into the frames she envisioned. Once she had set up production and negotiated deals with department stores, Schinasi opened an office where she oversaw marketing and distribution, later expanding her operation to the West Coast upon relocating to California. In 1939, Schinasi won the Lord & Taylor Annual American Design Award for her avant- garde transformation of the eyeglass frame into a proper fashion accessory. Vogue and Life magazines credited Schinasi with revolutionizing the eyewear industry and aesthetic. It was in California that her next creative phase would begin. California years In the 1940s, with hopes of spending more time on her art, Schinasi moved west to Los Angeles first expanding and finally selling her eyeglass concern. The move away from her business and New York allowed for a new level of commitment to her art. Having begun studies with Howard Warshaw at the Jepson School of Art in Los Angeles. Schinasi said, ‚ÄúI took a room in the house as my studio and put a sign on the door: ‚ÄòDo not come in unless there‚Äôs a catastrophe. I wanted to have three hours a day just to myself without interruption, and I really did work very hard.‚Äô‚ÄùSchinasi, p. 246 Schinasi began to paint in earnest and her large paintings were selected for the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) juried show. In Los Angeles, Schinasi spent many years as a volunteer art therapist and muralist at experimental mental health center, Synanon. George Grosz' Interregnum (1960) It was in California that Schinasi conceptualized and produced George Grosz' Interregnum, a short documentary film that features the anti-Nazi work of the celebrated artist and Schinasi‚Äôs former teacher. With Grosz‚Äô permission, given in a contract which Grosz wrote by hand on a napkin, Schinasi created a film of his drawings shot on sixteen-millimeter film. Grosz‚Äô book, A Big No and a Little Yes was the source of the narrated text read by Lotte Lenya. George Grosz' Interregnum was nominated for an Academy Award and won First Prize at the Venice Film Festival. Schinasi is credited as producer under the name Altina Carey, her married name at that time. The film was preserved by the Academy Film Archive in 2013. March on Washington Following on the success of George Grosz' Interregnum, Schinasi found herself drawn to Martin Luther King, Jr.‚Äôs March on Washington, to which to she acquired film rights. Schinasi engaged author John Oliver Killens to write the screenplay. When Killens had completed the script, Schinasi met with Dr. King in Atlanta to deliver the script. At Dr. King‚Äôs invitation, she visited Savior Church in Montgomery, Alabama where Dr. Martin Luther King, Sr. was the pastor and Dr. King, Jr. was the guest preacher that Sunday. From the pulpit, Dr. King, Jr. told the congregation about the script and how he looked forward to the movie. While in Alabama, Schinasi met Rosa Parks and taped an interview with Rev. Ralph Abernathy. Vittorio De Sica, the Italian director of the Bicycle Thieves, expressed interest in directing the film. However, Schinasi found it impossible to secure funding for the film, even from politically sympathetic potential investors, and the film was never made.Schinasi, pp. 292-7 Characters While looking at Cartier-Bresson‚Äôs photograph of unoccupied chairs, Schinasi was inspired to combine the function of the seat with the form of the sitter. She called these fantastic chairs and benches \\"chairacters\\". Schinasi first worked the core in Styrofoam and then sculpted the form in plaster. The fiberglass casts that were the final product were made of the sculpted prototype at a studio and factory in California. Her were featured on the cover of The Los Angeles Times Magazine.Schinasi, pp. 306-310 In 1973, Schinasi relocated to Washington D.C. where she would live for seventeen years. In 1978, she was interviewed by Pam Peabody at WPFW- Washington, D.C. about her 1978 exhibit at the Touchstone Gallery, as well as her life, work, and experience at Synanon. While at work on the , Schinasi's studio assistant left and she hired Celestino Miranda, who had recently arrived in United States, after seeking asylum from Cuba. When Schinasi traveled to Santa Fe for the summer, Miranda accompanied her there. A gifted artist in his own right, Celestino would prove a great collaborator and an inspiration. They returned to Washington at the summer's end. The pair married in 1981. Later years Schinasi continued to paint and sculpt, establishing herself in Santa Fe, New Mexico where with her fourth husband, painter Celestino Miranda, she lived the final years of her life.Schinasi, pp. 328-342 A documentary about her life, entitled Altina, was released in 2014.

Biography Etherege, born at Thame, Oxfordshire, was admitted a scholar of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, 11 November 1534, being placed under the tuition of John Shepreve. He was admitted B.A. 15 February 1538‚Äì9; was elected a probationer fellow of his college six days afterwards; commenced M.A. in July 1543; and was admitted bachelor of medicine and licensed to practise in 1545. According to the books of Christ Church, Oxford, he was regius professor of Greek from 25 March 1547 till 1 October 1550; and afterwards, in the same books, his name again appears from November 1554 till 21 April 1559. In 1556 he was recommended by Lord Williams of Thame to Sir Thomas Pope to be admitted fellow of Trinity College, then first founded; but as Etherege chose to pursue the medical line, that scheme did not take effect. As he had been a zealous catholic in Mary's reign, he was deprived of his professorship soon after Elizabeth's accession. Subsequently, he practised medicine with considerable success in Oxford and its vicinity. He lived with his family in 'an ancient decayed palace of literature called George-hall,‚Äô nearly opposite the south end of Cat Street in St. Mary's parish, and took in the sons of Catholic gentlemen as boarders. Among his pupils was William Giffard, afterwards archbishop of Rheims. On account of his firm adherence to the old form of religion he suffered frequent imprisonments both at Oxford and London during the space of about thirty years.

The agreement formalized principles that had been agreed in a political charter signed in Khartoum on 10 April 1996. Signatories The militia groups and their leaders were the South Sudan Independence Movement (SSIM) (Riek Machar Teny), the Union of Sudan African Parties (Samuel Aru Bol), the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) ( Kerubino Kuanyin Bol), the Equatoria Defense Force (Thiopholus Ochang Loti) and the South Sudan Independents Group (Kawac Makwei). Although Kerubino Kuanyin Bol signed on behalf of the SPLM, he had in fact been expelled from that group in 1987 on suspicion of planning a coup against John Garang, and been jailed for five years. After escaping, Kerubino had joined up with Riek Machar, but early in 1995 Riek dismissed Kerubino from his South Sudan Independence Movement (SSIM) on the basis that he had signed military and political agreements with the government of Sudan late in the previous year, and that they had attempted to form a government-supported faction in the SSIM. Agreement The agreement covered freedom of religion, movement and so on, and defined a federal structure with a formula for revenue sharing and with various powers devolved to the individual states. The agreement defined a four-year interim period to recover from the civil war in the southern states, with a Coordinating Council of the Southern States to oversee the transition. Riek Machar was made President of the Southern States Coordinating Council. He was also made commander in chief of the South Sudan Defense Force (SSDF), which included most of the ex-rebels who had signed the Khartoum agreement. The SSDF would maintain autonomy from the army, subject to a joint Technical Military Committee to coordinate between the Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) and the SSDF. A referendum on secession by Southern Sudan would be held before the end of the interim period, with international observers. Results The agreement has been described as \\"a hollow document signed by splinter groups but not by the main force in the south\\". Since it was not signed by the Sudan People's Liberation Army, the main secessionist force, the Khartoum Peace Agreement did not gain international legitimacy. However, it did provide the basis for many of the elements of the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement, including the clauses for an interim federal government, revenue sharing and the referendum. A polite analysis is that the agreement \\"called for the stipulation of institutions, the result of which worked imperfectly within a newly announced federal structure in the Sudan\\". Following signature of the agreement, the level of conflict escalated to the highest levels that had been seen since war broke out in 1955. The intensified conflict was funded in large part by foreign trade and investment associated with development of oil resources, many of which lay within the conflict area.

Built in 1850, it saw action in the American Civil War, serving as a headquarters for both the Union and Confederacy. During the action at Fayetteville, the house was attacked by Confederate troops while serving as a Union outpost. The building was donated to the Washington County Historical Society as a museum in 1967 and was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. History The house was constructed by Judge Jonas Tebbetts and his wife in the Greek Revival architectural style. It was completed by 1853. This beautiful home would come to play a significant role during the Civil War. Many of the residents of Fayetteville supported the South. However, Judge Tebbetts was an outspoken supporter of the Union. He was arrested in March 1862. Tebbetts was taken to Fort Smith by Confederate General Benjamin McCulloch. Tebbetts was released at the time of General McCulloch's death which occurred during the Battle of Pea Ridge. Tebbetts fled to Fayetteville where he learned of a price on his head. He and his family quickly evacuated to Missouri leaving their beloved home. That was the last time the Tebbetts Family inhabited the home. After the Tebbetts house was abandoned, the Union Army took it over and used it for their Headquarters. Action at Fayetteville The Headquarters House was the intended target of a Confederate attack on April 18, 1863. Union forces were using the house as a base for their northwest Arkansas operations. With a successful capture of the Headquarters House the Rebels could sweep the Union from northwest Arkansas. The Rebels attacked at 6:00 am in east Fayetteville, drawing fire while artillery climbed East Mountain and fired into the city. One cannonball struck the front door of the Headquarters House, and the house sustained lots of damage throughout the battle. The Union rallied and began to push the Confederates out of Fayetteville later in the morning. Despite a desperate charge up Dickson Street, the Confederates finally decided they could not take the Headquarters House and withdrew.Mahan, Russell L. Fayetteville, Arkansas, in the Civil War.

Over 7 million young people worldwide have taken up the Award challenge. A member of the International Award Association, the Israel Youth Award is one of 62 National Award Authorities delivering the International Award, which started life in the UK in 1956 as The Duke of Edinburgh's Award. History of The International Award Programme The Israel Youth Award is an exciting self-development Programme for all 14- to 25-year-olds. Over 7 million young people worldwide have taken up the Award challenge.A member of the International Award Association, the Israel Youth Award is one of 62 National Award Authorities delivering the International Award, which started life in the UK in 1956 as The Duke of Edinburgh‚Äôs Award. The Award Programme grew out of the efforts of three men, who were responding to a common anxiety about how best to engage young people. After the war there was a growing concern about the development of boys, due to the gap between leaving school at 15 and entering National Service at 18. Against this backdrop The Duke of Edinburgh's Award was set up in 1956, by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh; Kurt Hahn, a German educationalist; and John Lord Hunt, leader of the first successful ascent of Mount Everest. The Award Programme was introduced in Israel in 1986 by Yehuda Arel, who perceived it to be a practical challenge to Israeli youth. The Programme is operated in Israel as a not-for-profit organisation chaired by Nathan Wolloch, Deputy Mayor of Tel Aviv-Yafo, in a joint effort with the Ministry of Education, Youth and Society Administration. In practice, the Award Programme is delivered to young people by Award leaders from different cities and settlements, teachers, and students and leaders who have themselves completed the Programme. The uniqueness of the Programme lies in its multiculturalism and its openness to young people from all sectors of society ‚Äì religious or socio-economic. It encompasses Jews, Arabs, Druze, Christians and Bedouin, new immigrants and \\"Sabras\\" (native Israelis) alike, young people with disabilities, youth at risk, and youth with special needs. The basic philosophy The Award Programme is based on the educational philosophy of Dr. Kurt Hahn. Based on the philosophy of Hahn, founder and headmaster of Gordonstoun School in Scotland, the Programme was designed around four sections: Rescue & Public Service Training, the Expedition, Pursuits & Projects, and Fitness. Hahn‚Äôs ideas were considered progressive at the time, but today they remain as relevant as ever to young people living in a complex modern society. His theories were based on his belief in the British school system, his research on the teaching methods of the Greek philosopher Plato, and later, on his personal experience as a school principal. Specifically, his reading of Plato taught Hahn that education should bring about the balanced development of all human elements, in terms of body, mind, and soul. Thus, his vision was to provide a programme for personal development that would complete and broaden education. This end is achieved through the four Sections of the Programme: Service, Adventurous Journey, Physical Recreation and Skills. Hahn believed that the Award Programme would offer its participants a chance to realize their personality and their abilities - something that he considered to be a necessary step in the self-development of youth. He saw the Award Programme as a tool through which young people are encouraged to explore new areas and to discover new talents within and by themselves. A Programme for everyone The founder of the Programme, the Duke of Edinburgh, believed that every young person, anywhere around the world, at the right age, has the potential to participate in the Award and to complete the Levels successfully. A mental or physical ability or social circumstances should not be an obstacle. That is why the Programme is equally open to all. The criteria of Award receipt, after successful completion of one of the Levels, are individual effort and self-improvement. Progress is measured only against one's personal capabilities and objectives; meaning, this is a non-competitive program of individual challenge. The Award Programme can be adjusted so it would match individual discrepancies in abilities, focus of interests and life circumstances. As a result, the Programme provides a special opportunity for young people with special needs to be equal in rights and mandates, next to their healthy peers. Perhaps this principle of universality is the most important factor in the immense success of the International Award Programme all across the world. One should note that the basic structure and the philosophy of the Award Programme has not changed since its inception in 1956. Only specific details within the frame were modified, naturally due to the accumulated experience and for the purpose of maintaining the relevance of the Programme, in terms of its ability to fulfill the changing needs of young people today.  Levels  A marathon and not a sprint ‚Äì A successful completion of every Level demands determination and commitment, instead of a short burst of enthusiasm. The defined time for each Level is the minimal requirement. This allows the participants to work at their own pace, according to their amount of spare time, up until their 25th birthday. =Bronze = 80px Participants must be at least age 14 to enter. A minimum of one hour a week is required per activity. Participants record their activity for each of the four Sections in their record bookService: * Service ‚Äì at least one hour a week. * Personal Skill ‚Äì at least one hour a week. * Physical Recreation ‚Äì at least one hour a week. * Adventurous Journey/Research ‚Äì Plan prepare and undertake a 2-day, 1 night Adventurous Journey in a group covering a minimum total distance of: Walking 24‚Äì35 km or Cycling 100‚Äì130 km over two consecutive days. In Israel, at Bronze Level, this section is filled by a journey made not by the participants but the Award holder and authority. After a minimum 6 months (or more, depending on the participant, there is no \\"deadline\\") the participant is eligible to receive the Bronze Award, if the participant has completed all four sections. In Israel, the Bronze Award badge is designed specially for the Israel Award and has the Award symbol and the Bronze badge symbol (this badge is approved by the International Award Association) (www.intaward.org). =Silver = 80px Participants must be at least age 15 to start their Silver. A new Level holds new challenges, with a minimum of two hours‚Äô a week required for each section. Just as at Bronze Level, there are four sections to complete. Entering directly to Silver is possible, but there are further requirements: * Service ‚Äì two hours a week * Personal Skill ‚Äì two hours a week * Physical Recreation ‚Äì two hours a week * Adventurous Journey/Research ‚Äì Plan prepare and undertake a 3-day, 2 night Adventurous Journey in a group covering a minimum total distance of: Walking 54‚Äì79 km or Cycling 190‚Äì220 km over 3 consecutive days. In Israel, this section is filled by a journey made not by the participants but the Award holder and authority. After a minimum 12 months (for participants who finished the Bronze level. 18 months is required for participants who have entered directly at Silver) the participant is eligible to receive the Silver Award, if the participant has completed all four sections. In Israel the Silver Award badge is designed especially for the Award and has the Award symbol and the Bronze badge symbol (this badge is approved by the International Award Association). =Gold = 80px Participants must be at least age 16 to enter at Gold. A minimum of three hours‚Äô a week is required. There are five sections to complete at Gold Level: * Service ‚Äì three hours a week * Personal Skill ‚Äì three hours a week * Physical Recreation ‚Äì three hours a week * Adventurous Journey/Research ‚Äì Plan prepare and undertake a 4-day, 3 night Adventurous Journey in a group covering a minimum total distance of: Walking 84‚Äì110 km or Cycling 300‚Äì350 km over 4 consecutive days. * Residential Project ‚Äì A shared activity with a group in a residential setting for 5 days and 4 nights, available in Israel through different cities or in a delegation. In Israel, the Adventurous Journey is not made by the participants but the Award holder and authority. After a minimum 12 months (for participants who have completed Silver Level. 24 months is required for participants who entered directly to Gold) the participant is eligible to receive the Gold Award, if the participant has completed all four Sections, plus their Residential Project. Upon completion, participants are invited to the Annual Gold Award ceremony, held at the home of the British Ambassador in Israel, where they will be presented with their Gold Award badges.  Sections  = Service = Participants engage with their community and discover the impact they can have through: *Community service projects *Conservation work *Voluntary service in hospitals or community homes *More specialised training, such as lifesaving, first aid or rescue services. = Adventurous Journey = The Adventurous Journey is about adventure and discovery. Participants develop an understanding of the environment, and the importance of working together in a team with a common purpose. It can be on foot, by bicycle, boat or on horseback. Training, preparation, self- sufficiency and self-reliance are the key elements. =Skills= The Skills Section is about developing personal interests and learning practical skills. There are almost limitless possibilities to choose from. There is no set standard that participants must reach: they set their own goals and measure their progress against them. =Physical Recreation= By undertaking some form of organised and regular physical activity, participants show perseverance and improve their fitness. Their goal is to record their individual progress. Most team and individual sports are included, such as football, athletics, and archery. =Residential Project= This is only a requirement at Gold Level. It aims to broaden experience through living and working with others (who are not everyday companions). The project takes place over a period of five consecutive days. It requires resilience, adaptability and consideration for others. The Award Programme In Israel The Israel Youth Award operates under the auspices of the Ministry of Education's unit for youth and society, and is led by twenty-three board members, including public representatives, educators and volunteers. The Programme is operated by leaders, volunteers, students receiving a \\"Perach\\" scholarship and Award leaders. The Programme is unique due to the fact that young people aged 14‚Äì25 from diverse backgrounds take part in it, as well as its ability to develop their skills and discover their goals. It allows anyone, no matter what their religion, race, gender, ability or political affinity, to participate. The Award enables young people to realize their potential by developing their creativity; increasing their general knowledge and helping them reach higher achievements. It teaches them to preserve and take on leadership roles and to create a stronger link to their country. In addition, it increases their social and communal involvement and encourages them to help others. The Programme educates young people to use their spare time constructively through four fields of activities: hobbies and skills, sports and recreation, expeditions and community service. It allows personal growth and self- discovery through gradual transformation, starting at Bronze Level, moving on to Silver and finally reaching Gold. It promotes links between youth from all over the country, and from all sectors. The Award also encourages Israeli youth to link up with young people from all over the world and act as Israeli young ambassadors through various delegations, youth exchanges, international conventions and seminars. The Award Programme is non-competitive and is given on the basis of the personal process that each participant undergoes.

He suffers from a number of calamities: his cattle are destroyed, his servants slain by the sword, and his family crushed under his roof. But he holds fast to his faith in Allah. As a further calamity he is covered with loathsome sores from head to foot. He loses his peace of mind, and he curses the day he was born. His false friends come and attribute his afflictions to sin. These \\"Job's comforters\\" are no comforters at all, and he further loses his balance of mind, but Allah recalls to him all His mercies, and he resumes his humility and gives up self-justification. He is restored to prosperity, with twice as much as he had before; his brethren and friends come back to him; he had a new family of seven sons and three fair daughters. He lived to a good old age, and saw four generations of descendants. All this is recorded in the Book of Job in the Old Testament. Of all the Hebrew writings, the Hebrew of this Book comes nearest to Arabic.\\" Job's story in Islam is parallel to the Hebrew Bible's story, although the main emphasis is on Job remaining steadfast to God; there is no mention of Job's discussions with friends in the Qur'anic text, but later Muslim literature states that Job had brothers, who argued with the man about the cause of his affliction. Some Muslim commentators also spoke of Job as being the ancestor of the Romans.Brandon M. Wheeler, Historical Dictionary of Prophets in Islam and Judaism, Job, p. 171. Islamic literature also comments on Job's time and place of prophetic ministry, saying that he came after Joseph in the prophetic series and that he preached to his own people rather than being sent to a specified community. Tradition further recounts that Job will be the leader in Heaven of the group of \\"those who patiently endured\\".Encyclopedia of Islam, A. Jefferey, Ayyub In the Quran Ayy≈´b (Job) is first mentioned in the Quran in the following verse: The Quran describes Job as a righteous servant of Allah, who was afflicted by suffering for a lengthy period of time. However, it clearly states that Job never lost faith in God and forever called to God in prayer, asking Him to remove his affliction: The narrative goes on to state that after many years of suffering, God ordered Job to \\"Strike with thy foot!\\". At once, Job struck the ground with his foot and God caused a cool spring of water to gush forth from the Earth, from which Job could replenish himself. The Quran states that it was then that God removed his pain and suffering and He returned Job's family to him, blessed him with many generations of children and granted him great wealth. In addition to the brief descriptions of Job's narrative, the Quran further mentions Job twice in the lists of those whom God had given special guidance, wisdom and inspiration (IV: 163) and as one of the men who received authority, the Book and the gift of prophethood (VI:84). After Satan has given up trying to turn Job away from the Lord, God removed Job's affliction and returned his family to him, doubling them in number. He returned Job's wealth and showered Job with gold. Once Job's wife had seen her husband restored to prosperity and health, she prayed thanks to God but then worried over the oath her husband had taken earlier, in which he had promised to beat her with a hundred strokes. Job was also deeply grieved over the oath he had taken, amidst his suffering. God, however, sent a revelation to Job, which told him to not beat his wife but to gently hit her with a bundle of soft grass.Qur'an 38:44 Qur'anic commentary and Muslim tradition Ibn Kathir narrates the story in the following manner. Job was a very rich person with much land, and many animals and children ‚Äî all of which were lost and soon he was struck with skin disease as a test from God. He was afflicted with sores that crawled with worms. He remained steadfast and patient, so God eventually relieved him of the disease. Job's lineage was an important field of study for many of the early Islamic scholars. A prevalent belief among early commentators was that Job descended from the line of Esau, the son of Ishaq. Although various commentators gave different genealogies relating to Job, all of them traced his ancestry to Abraham through Isaac's son Esau.Ibn Kathir states in Stories of the Prophets: \\"Ibn Ishaaq stated that he was a man of Rum. His name was Job, son of Mose, son of Razeh, son of Esau, son of Isaac, son of Abraham.\\" Those scholars who traced Job's lineage back to Abraham did so by using the following Qur'anic verse as the basis for their view: > \\"That was the reasoning about Us which We gave to Abraham (to use) against > his people. We raise whom We will in degree, for thy Lord is full of wisdom > and knowledge. We bestowed upon him [Abraham] Isaac and Jacob, all (three) > We guided; and before him We guided Noah and among his progeny David, > Solomon, Job, Joseph, Moses, and Aaron. Thus do We reward those who do > good.\\" Muslim historical literature fleshes out Job's story and describes him as being a late descendant of the patriarch Noah. Similar to the Hebrew Bible's narrative, Ibn Kathir mentions that Satan heard the angels of God speak of Job as being the most faithful man of his generation. Job, being a chosen prophet of God, would remain committed in daily prayer and would frequently call to God, thanking God for blessing him with abundant wealth and a large family. But Satan planned to turn the God-fearing Job away from God and wanted Job to fall into disbelief and corruption. Therefore, God allowed Satan to afflict Job with distress and intense illness and suffering, as God knew that Job would never turn away from his Lord. Although Job's possessions were destroyed and he suffered many calamities, he remained steadfast in his worship of God and remained committed to his religion. Satan then appeared to Job in the guise of an old man and suggested that God was not rewarding Job for his prayer. Job, however, rebuked Satan and told him that God is all-knowing and does what He thinks is best. It is said that then Satan, having failed at tempting Job, turned to Job's wife, who was also a faithful woman. Satan reminded Job's wife of her life before Job's affliction and how they were abundant in family and fortune. Job's wife, although she did not lose faith, burst into tears and asked Job to tell God to remove this suffering from the household. Job, in his misery, rebuked his wife and told her that this suffering had been for a relatively short period of time and, without thinking, told her that he would beat her with 100 strokes for complaining. After Job was cured, Allah ordered him to take some grass and to hit her 100 times. By doing this, Job fulfilled his promise to Allah but didn't hurt her. This Islamic narrative has now become symbolic and is often used by Islamic preachers as a reminder to be kind with wives.Ibn Kathir, Stories of the Prophets, The Story of the Prophet Job Philip K.

She was an icon of democracy. Magsanoc was editor of the crusading weekly opposition tabloid Mr & Ms Special Edition. She was editor in chief of the Philippine Daily Inquirer. Magsanoc is among three journalists whose names were added to the Bantayog ng mga Bayani (Monument of Heroes) Wall of Remembrance in 2016. Bantayog ng mga Bayani cited her for \\"speaking truth to power without fear.\\" Magasanoc was recognized \\"for testing the limits of press freedom as writer and editor, for defying media restrictions and censorship under martial rule and for facing up to the wrath of the dictatorship.\\" The Philippine Senate, in a resolution filed shortly after her death, recognized Magsanoc for her contribution to the restoration of freedom in the Philippines. Personal life Jimenez-Magsanoc was the eldest of nine children of Colonel Nicanor Jimenez, a former Philippine National Railways (PNR) manager and director of the NISA, the government intelligence agency, later Philippine ambassador to Korea. She is survived by her husband Dr. Carlitos Magsanoc; and her children Kara Magsanoc, married to Dondi Alikpala and their children; Dr. Nikko Magsanoc, married to Gina Bengzon Magsanoc; and Dr. Marti Magsanoc. Magsanoc described herself as \\"newspaper-struck\\" from an early age, contributing features to the (Philippine) Sunday Times Magazine while a senior at St. Teresa's College, Manila, encouraged by Times women's editor Eugenia Apostol. She spent most of the 1960s in the United States, taking a masters in journalism at the University of Missouri. In 1963, she married Carlos Magsanoc, a doctor. Her daughter Kara Magsanoc-Alikpala is a broadcast journalist who produces news documentaries. Jimenez-Magsanoc died on the night of Christmas Eve, December 24, 2015 at St. Luke's Medical Center in Taguig City, after suffering from cardiac arrest.http://www.rappler.com/nation/117033-inquirer-editor-chief-letty- jimenez-magsanoc-dead Early career The Magsanoc family returned to the Philippines in 1969. Magsanoc joined the Manila Bulletin. When the women's section editor of the Bulletin's Sunday magazine, Panorama left, Magsanoc was asked to take the job. \\"The last place I wanted to land in, in any publication was the women's pages, which I consider a journalism ghetto. I was trying to get away from writing about lipstick and fashion. fortunately I was allowed to write about almost anything. Sometimes it had nothing to do with women.\\". In 1976, Magsanoc began to write for the daily Manila Bulletin, after a co- editorship with a male colleague did not work. She wrote a thrice weekly column, The Passing Scene, alternating with columnist Tony Nieva. Later, she was given her own column Not for People Only. This was when she began to get into trouble with authorities for being critical of the post-martial law Marcos government. In 1978, General Hans Menzi, publisher of the Manila Bulletin, asked Magsanoc to take over the editorship of Panorama. Magsanoc was reluctant. \\"I did not want to be editor because I just wanted to do writing. You know what it's like to be editor, you have to sit at the desk, give out assignments, and clean up everybody's copy. It is difficult to conceptualize the whole issue. What I wanted to do was go out and write.\\" She demanded that Panorama be given a 60 per cent editorial to 40 per cent advertising ratio and to her surprise, Menzie agreed. Magsanoc's arrival at Panorama gave the magazine a new reputation. Circulation soared with Magsanoc's editorship. Panorama staffer Margot Baterina said: \\"We pursued stories that nobody else dared to touch.\\" National Press Club data of the time put the magazine's circulation at 300,000 on Sundays more than triple the combined circulation of the two other morning dailes. Panorama Between 1976 and 1981, Letty Jimenez Magsanoc was editor of Panorama, the Philippines' largest circulation magazine of the time. Five months after being named one of the 1981 Ten Outstanding Women of the New Society she was forced to resign after writing an article perceived as critical to the government. A Time magazine article which hailed Magsanoc as an Asian hero described the circumstances that forced her departure from Panorama: \\"Magsanoc had written a tongue-in-cheek story on Marcos' third inauguration as President. Marcos had sought to fend off criticism of his rule by staging a faux election. His \\"victory\\" was celebrated in a sumptuous, if surreal, ceremony, in which a choir sang Handel's Messiah. Magsanoc led off with a line from Handel: \\"And he shall reign forever and ever.\\" Marcos thought that blasphemous and got her fired.\\" Magsanoc's forced resignation sparked a media furore, with journalists using their columns to speak out, though several pieces were suppressed by publishers. Several articles rejected by other magazines were published by Eugenia Apostol's women's magazine, Mr & Ms. Magsanoc's article was a piece about the inauguration, illustrated with candid photographs and captions, under the title There Goes the New Society; Welcome the New Republic =Events following Magsanoc's forced resignation= The forced resignation of Letty Jimenez Magsanoc was the first of a series of events that led to criticism of the Marcos government for suppressing press freedom.

Magsanoc was invited to become editor of Mr & Ms Special Edition by publisher Eugenia Apostol in the aftermath of the assassination of opposition leader Benigno Aquino, Jr.. Apostol, in her acceptance speech at the 2006 Magsaysay Award for Journalism, Literature and Creative Communication Arts, said: \\"The Filipinos were outraged and more than two million of them joined (Aquino's) funeral procession. But the Marcos media hardly took note of the event. That was when I decided to do a 16-page special issue on Ninoy Aquino's funeral, using the resources of a woman's magazine called Mr. & Ms. which I was then editing ... The response to the funeral issue was unbelievable. The agents kept coming back for more, and so we had to print 500 thousand copies. After that, I had to ask Letty Jimenez-Magsanoc to help me edit a weekly Mr. & Ms. Special Edition just to feed the hunger of the readers for more about Ninoy and a growing anger towards martial law and Ferdinand Marcos. Every week we felt called upon to record the various demonstrations of civilians against Marcos, and when no reprisal came (except for an invitation to an interrogation at Fort Bonifacio in January 1983), we went on for three years ...\\" Sunday Inquirer Magazine Magsanoc was the first editor-in- chief of the Sunday Inquirer Magazine from 1986 to 1987.

Its subject is giant ants who conquer humankind in the future. Background After the demise of DeshBondhu Chittaranjan Dash [‡¶¶‡ßá‡¶∂‡¶¨‡¶®‡ßç‡¶ß‡ßÅ ‡¶ö‡¶ø‡¶§‡ßç‡¶§‡¶∞‡¶û‡ßç‡¶ú‡¶® ‡¶¶‡¶æ‡¶∂], during 1925-26 a communal riot took place in Calcutta. Mitra then shifted to his birthplace Varanasi, where he met two brothers from Calcutta, Manaranjan Bhattacharya [‡¶Æ‡¶®‡ßã‡¶∞‡¶û‡ßç‡¶ú‡¶® ‡¶≠‡¶ü‡ßç‡¶ü‡¶æ‡¶ö‡¶æ‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶Ø] & Khshitindra Narayan Bhattacharya [‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶∑‡¶ø‡¶§‡ßÄ‡¶®‡ßç‡¶¶‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶®‡¶æ‡¶∞‡¶æ‡¶Ø‡¶º‡¶£ ‡¶≠‡¶ü‡ßç‡¶ü‡¶æ‡¶ö‡¶æ‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶Ø]. These three planned to write various interesting children literature based on science. Mitra wrote a small novel and nearly after three years, it was published in Ramdhonu [‡¶∞‡¶æ‡¶Æ‡¶ß‡¶®‡ßÅ] (The Rainbow) (a magazine for children edited by Manaranjan Bhattacharya). Later, this novel was printed from D. M. Library as a book with the name: Pinpre Puran. Besides this novel, he also wrote many other novels and stories, such as: Kuhoker Deshe [‡¶ï‡ßÅ‡¶π‡¶ï‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶¶‡ßá‡¶∂‡ßá], Prithibeer Shatru [‡¶™‡ßÉ‡¶•‡¶ø‡¶¨‡ßÄ‡¶∞ ‡¶∂‡¶§‡ßç‡¶∞‡ßÅ], Kalapanir Atole [‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶≤‡¶æ‡¶™‡¶æ‡¶®‡¶ø‡¶∞ ‡¶Ö‡¶§‡¶≤‡ßá], etc. and the famous Ghanada series, all of which cover a wide range of science fiction. Plot The novel is about a future world. At present time of the novel, the world is overrun with Ants. They are six feet tall, intelligent and organised. While humans were busy fighting within themselves, the Ants had begun their preparations to take over the planet. They had emerged from their hideouts in the Andes Mountain and had begun their major assault in 7757 and from then, they are defeating the humans in battles. In that year, all of the main cities on the western side of longitude 70¬∞ West of South America ruined in a single day by an under-earth attack. One by one the cities of Peru, Venezuela and Ecuador came down like blocks of cards. The only man who escaped this attack unscathed was Don Perito [‡¶°‡¶® ‡¶™‡ßá‡¶∞‡¶ø‡¶ü‡ßã], who escaped to Mexico. He was the first human to describe the destruction wrought by the Ants. Within a few years, the Ants had taken over the entire South America. The weapon of mass destruction that they used was a suicide bomb. They also used advanced technological weapons, for example, the Ants used a kind of searching, powerful light, somewhat green in colour that took away human sight in an instant. This story of the battle is broken into small sub-sections with first-person narrations. The first narrator is the storyteller who begins the story. Soon it is turned to the diary of Ashesh Roy [‡¶Ö‡¶∂‡ßá‡¶∑ ‡¶∞‡¶æ‡¶Ø‡¶º], an explorer who had first seen the Ants in 6757. The third narration is by Senor Sabatini [‡¶∏‡ßá‡¶®‡¶∞ ‡¶∏‡¶æ‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶§‡¶ø‡¶®‡¶ø], a famous writer of Rio de Janeiro who describes the third deadly attack. The fourth and final narration is by Sukhomoy Sarkar [‡¶∏‡ßÅ‡¶ñ‡¶Æ‡¶Ø‡¶º ‡¶∏‡¶∞‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶∞], a Bengali who was imprisoned by the Ants and after five years, he somehow escaped. He gives the most comprehensive details of the social and economic organization of them. The description by Sukhomoy Sarkar of the society of Ants is like this: The Ants live in a democracy. The intelligent Ants provide suggestions on science and technology to those Ants who conduct the administration. They are highly advanced compared to humans in knowledge and social structures, and have a strict sense of justice. Mitra concludes this novel with declaration that the whole mankind is united, forgetting their internal enmity, to fight their common enemy. Review As observed by Debjani Sengupta in her essay Sadhanbabu's Friends: Science Fiction in Bengal from 1882-1961: \\"...Mitra hints at a time when the very existence of humans will be endangered, when common flowers and trees will be a thing of the past.\\"Debjani Sengupta (2003). , Sarai Reader: Shaping Technologies 3.

In 1908, in order to avoid arrest and to further her education, she went to Paris, where she enrolled in the medical school of the Sorbonne. She attended meetings of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party, where she met young people who shared her love of poetry and introduced her to the Russian symbolist poets, who made a deep impression on her. In 1909 these friends introduced her to Ilya Ehrenburg, a meeting that was significant for both of them. For a time they were inseparable, and it was she who introduced Ehrenburg to modern poetry and inspired his first verses, as he describes in his memoirs.Ilya Ehrenburg, –õ—é–¥–∏, –≥–æ–¥—ã, –∂–∏–∑–Ω—å (Sovetsky pisatel, 1961), p. 114: –õ–∏–∑–∞ —Å—Ç—Ä–∞—Å—Ç–Ω–æ –ª—é–±–∏–ª–∞ –ø–æ—ç–∑–∏—é; –æ–Ω–∞ –º–Ω–µ —á–∏—Ç–∞–ª–∞ —Å—Ç–∏—Ö–∏ –ë–∞–ª—å–º–æ–Ω—Ç–∞, –ë—Ä—é—Å–æ–≤–∞, –ë–ª–æ–∫–∞. –Ø –ø–æ–¥—Ç—Ä—É–Ω–∏–≤–∞–ª –Ω–∞–¥ –ù–∞–¥–µ–π –õ—å–≤–æ–≤–æ–π, –∫–æ–≥–¥–∞ –æ–Ω–∞ –≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∏–ª–∞, —á—Ç–æ –ë–ª–æ–∫ ‚Äî –±–æ–ª—å—à–æ–π –ø–æ—ç—Ç. –õ–∏–∑–µ —è –Ω–µ —Å–º–µ–ª –ø—Ä–æ—Ç–∏–≤–æ—Ä–µ—á–∏—Ç—å. –í–æ–∑–≤—Ä–∞—â–∞—è—Å—å –æ—Ç –Ω–µ—ë –¥–æ–º–æ–π, —è –±–æ—Ä–º–æ—Ç–∞–ª: \\"–ó–∞–º–æ–ª–∫–∞–µ—Ç —Å–≤–µ—Ç–ª—ã–π –≤–µ—Ç–µ—Ä, –Ω–∞—Å—Ç—É–ø–∞–µ—Ç —Å–µ—Ä—ã–π –≤–µ—á–µ—Ä...\\" –ü–æ—á–µ–º—É –≤–µ—Ç–µ—Ä —Å–≤–µ—Ç–ª—ã–π? –≠—Ç–æ–≥–æ —è –Ω–µ –º–æ–≥ —Å–µ–±–µ –æ–±—ä—è—Å–Ω–∏—Ç—å, –Ω–æ —á—É–≤—Å—Ç–≤–æ–≤–∞–ª, —á—Ç–æ –æ–Ω –¥–µ–π—Å—Ç–≤–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ —Å–≤–µ—Ç–ª—ã–π. –Ø –Ω–∞—á–∞–ª –±—Ä–∞—Ç—å –≤ \\"–¢—É—Ä–≥–µ–Ω–µ–≤–∞\\" —Å—Ç–∏—Ö–∏ —Å–æ–≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –ø–æ—ç—Ç–æ–≤ –∏ –≤–¥—Ä—É–≥ –ø–æ–Ω—è–ª, —á—Ç–æ —Å—Ç–∏—Ö–∞–º–∏ –º–æ–∂–Ω–æ —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞—Ç—å —Ç–æ, —á–µ–≥–æ –Ω–µ —Å–∫–∞–∂–µ—à—å –ø—Ä–æ–∑–æ–π. –ê –º–Ω–µ –Ω—É–∂–Ω–æ –±—ã–ª–æ —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞—Ç—å –õ–∏–∑–µ –æ—á–µ–Ω—å –º–Ω–æ–≥–æ–µ... Leslie Dorfman Davis writes: \\"Aside from poetry, Erenburg and Mov≈°enson shared a satirical impulse which provoked disapproval from some of their older comrades. [...] Mov≈°enson and Erenburg [jointly] published two journals, Byv≈°ie ljudi (Former People) and Tixoe semejstvo (A Quiet Family), in which they 'rather caustically, without any sort of reverence, mocked the manners of the Bolshevik circle, insulting even the 'chiefs' (Plexanov, Lenin, Trotskij), and therefore had a sensational response.' [...] Although they quarreled and Erenburg fell in love with another woman, Ekaterina Schmidt, he and Mov≈°enson remained friends and corresponded until his death.\\"Davis, Serapion Sister, p. 21. While in Paris, Liza became acquainted with both Russian and French writers and drifted away from her affiliation with the Bolsheviks; unlike other members of the √©migr√© community (but like Ehrenburg), she was fluent in French and immersed in the intellectual and artistic life of the city.Davis, Serapion Sister, p. 22. It was also in Paris that she published her first poems. In 1914 she graduated from medical school, and after the outbreak of the First World War, she worked for a few months at a hospital in Nancy and then helped run a newly organized military hospital in Neuilly-sur-Seine. In March 1915 she learned that Russian doctors who had trained abroad were being urged to return and receive Russian diplomas so they could serve on the Eastern Front, and she made her way back to Russia via a steamship to Greece and a train through the Balkans. On her arrival in Petrograd, she found her family mourning her father's death; she received her diploma from the University of Tartu and the title of lekar' (physician) in July and went to the Galician front, where she remained until April 1917 supervising an epidemiological division. It was during this period that she met an engineer named Lev Davidovich Polonsky in Kiev; they became lovers and had a son, Mikhail. Although they did not marry (the relationship ended because of another woman to whom he was already engaged), Liza took his family name (she was known as Polonskaya for the rest of her life), and the two kept up a correspondence. He asked her to marry him after his wife died, but she refused, preferring her independence). She left her infant son with her family and briefly returned to the front.Davis, Serapion Sister, p. 23. Career On her final return to Petrograd in the spring of 1917, she had little time for either politics or literature; to support her family, which was in dire straits after her father's death, she took a job as assistant to a municipal charity doctor on Vasilyevsky Island, and was merely a spectator when the October Revolution occurred. From then until the 1930s, she worked in different Soviet medical settings, combining medicine with her writing.Elizaveta Polonskaya (1890‚Äì1969). By the winter of 1918-19, she was writing in her spare moments, and when she learned (from a streetcar advertisement) of the courses being offered by the Translators' Studio at the publishing house World Literature (), newly established by Maxim Gorky, she immediately went to the Muruzi House (Mourousis family House) and signed up for Nikolay Gumilev's poetry class and Viktor Shklovsky's class on literary theory.Davis, Serapion Sister, p. 24. It was there that she met and befriended the writers who were soon to form the Serapion Brothers; she was particularly close to Lev Lunts, whom she called \\"the most serapionic\\" of the group, and shared his insistence on artistic independence and the importance of Western literature (as opposed to the \\"Scythianism,\\" or Russian exclusivity, that was popular at the time).Davis, Serapion Sister, p. 25. Even after the slow dissolution of the group (around the time of Lunts's emigration in 1923 and premature death in 1924), she kept in touch with a number of the Serapions and their friends, particularly Veniamin Kaverin and Korney Chukovsky.Davis, Serapion Sister, pp. 26‚Äì7. She published her second verse collection, Pod kammenym dozhdyom (Under a stone rain), in 1923; by the time of her third, Upryamy kalendar' (A stubborn calendar), in 1929, she had begun to move \\"from strictly lyric poetry to ballads, narrative poems, and literary portraits.\\"Davis, Serapion Sister, p. 27. From the 1920s she worked as a translator (beginning with Rudyard Kipling's \\"Ballad of East and West\\"), bringing into Russian works by Shakespeare, Victor Hugo, Julian Tuwim, and others, as well as the Armenian epic David of Sasun. Chukovsky also helped her establish herself as a poet for children. =1930s and 1940s= In 1931 Polonskaya gave up the practice of medicine to become a full-time writer, focusing on prose sketches;Davis, Serapion Sister, p. 31. the turn from creative writing to journalism was common among women poets at the time, for example her friend Maria Shkapskaya.Barbara Heldt, \\"Motherhood in a Cold Climate: The Poetry and Career of Maria Shkapskaya\\" in Stephanie Sandler, Sexuality and the Body in Russian Culture (Stanford University Press, 1998: ), p. 242. Towards the end of the decade \\"she was suffering from a worrisome heart condition, which interfered with her work and contributed to recurring bouts of despair,\\"Davis, Serapion Sister, p. 37. but shortly after the German invasion of Russia she and her family had to leave Leningrad for the Urals, first in Polazna and then (from November 1942) in Molotov.Davis, Serapion Sister, pp. 37‚Äì8. During this period she worked for a time as a school doctor, but on her return to Leningrad in 1944 she became once again a full-time writer.Davis, Serapion Sister, p. 39. =Postwar= After the war, she suffered both personal and professional setbacks. In December 1945 her beloved mother had a stroke, dying in January 1946, and her projected novel about the rebuilding of Leningrad, Gorod [The city], was rejected by the publisher, forcing her to return an advance she had already spent (she managed to get Litfond, the writers' literary fund, to pay the advance in exchange for literary work).Davis, Serapion Sister, p. 40. Furthermore, the zhdanovshchina of the late 1940s was not only painful for her because of the vicious attacks on friends like Mikhail Zoshchenko, it was dangerous for her because of her association with the Serapion Brothers, whose principles were now considered heretical by the Party, and the persecution of Jews and doctors involved in the Doctors' plot of early 1953 added to her peril.Davis, Serapion Sister, p. 172. Although she continued to work as a translator and journalist (her sketches were published almost exclusively in Gudok [Train Whistle]), her only book published between 1945 and 1960 was Na svoikh plechakh [On their own shoulders] (1948), a collection of short prose pieces about the heroism of young Red Cross nurses in Leningrad during the war which was favorably reviewed.Davis, Serapion Sister, pp. 40‚Äì1. In the late 1950s she was abruptly dismissed from her post as head of the Translators' Section of the Writers Union. However, by 1960 she was able to publish a collection of her poetry, and another followed in 1966 (both consisted mostly of earlier work, with a few new poems). She also began publishing selections from her memoirs, though she was never able to publish them in book form (a collection was finally published in 2008).Goroda i vstrechi [Cities and meetings], Moscow: Novoe literaturnoe obozrenie, 2008 Illness forced her to stop writing in 1967, and she died in January 1969.Davis, Serapion Sister, p. 42. Reception Although Polonskaya was highly respected in the 1920s‚Äîin 1926 the critic D. S. Mirsky called her \\"the most gifted of the young poetesses\\"D. S. Mirsky, Contemporary Russian Literature, 1881-1925 (Kraus Reprint, 1972), p. 279.‚Äîshe fell into obscurity, both because of the difficulty of keeping a career going as a single mother and for political reasons.Davis, Serapion Sister, pp. 1‚Äì3, 208‚Äì9. Her name began to be mentioned again with the revival of interest in the Serapion Brothers from the 1960s on, but only as a member of that group; the most attention she received until the publication of Leslie Dorfman Davis's critical study Serapion Sister in 2001 was from Wolfgang Kasack, who wrote that her poetry was \\"clear and beautiful,\\" avoiding obvious emotion and sometimes sounding prosaic, \\"acting on the reader through its humanness and depth of thought alone.\\"Wolfgang Kasack, –õ–µ–∫—Å–∏–∫–æ–Ω —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–π –ª–∏—Ç–µ—Ä–∞—Ç—É—Ä—ã XX –≤–µ–∫–∞ = Lexikon der russischen Literatur ab 1917 (Moscow, ¬´–ö—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä–∞¬ª, 1996: ), p. 325. Viktor Shklovsky wrote of her: > Like A. Veksler, Elizaveta Polonskaya wore black gloves on her hands. It was > the sign of their order. > Polonskaya writes poems. Out in the world, she's a doctor, a calm and strong > person. Jewish, but not an imitator. Her blood is good and thick. She writes > little. She has some good poems about present-day Russia.

Events leading to the protests July =14‚Äì22 July 2011= The protest compound on Rothschild Boulevard in Tel Aviv, July 21, 2011 During the first two days of protests (14‚Äì15 July 2011), about 50 tents were pitched on Rothschild Boulevard in central Tel Aviv. The encampment quickly grew as more protesters arrived and additional tents were pitched. By 6 August, the Rothschild Boulevard tent camp had grown to about 400 tents and hundreds of people. Among the groups participating in the protest were a Facebook group called the \\"Tel Aviv group\\" and a group from Holon called \\"The Youth Movement\\". One of the protesters opened an installation by taking the furniture from his apartment and setting up a living room at the Rothschild Boulevard protest. Tent camps were also set up in other areas of Tel Aviv. The camps were established on land allotted to protesters by the Tel Aviv municipality. About 20 tents were also pitched in central Jerusalem. On 16 July 2011, the National Union of Israeli Students joined the protests, stating that more demonstration centers would open across Israel staffed by students from Ruppin College, Beit Berl College, Tel-Hai College, as well as Beersheba and Kiryat Shmona. On 17 July 2011, the Hashomer Hatzair movement joined the protests. MKs Ilan Gilon of Meretz and Nino Abesadze of Kadima joined the protests for one night. In addition, many Israeli artists joined the public protests. On 19 July 2011, local students set up tents outside the walls of the Old City of Jerusalem, across from the Mamilla Mall. The students requested permission from the Jerusalem Municipality to establish a tent city, but were denied by city officials, because they feared it could harm tourism. However, city officials announced their support of the protesters' cause. On 20 July 2011, protests reached the Orthodox city of El'ad, where a few dozen protesters gathered at the entrance to the city to protest against high rent rates. In Ashdod, demonstrators pitched six tents, while members of the \\"Ashdod is Awakening\\" movement urged the mayor to promote an affordable housing program. In Kiryat Shmona, dozens of youths blocked junctions in the city. Charlie Biton, a former leader of the Israeli Black Panthers movement, joined the protest encampment in Jerusalem to express his support. On 21 July 2011, a group of students protested in central Tel Aviv, blocking the intersection near the Defense Ministry headquarters, and conducting a sit-in at a building under construction on Dizengoff Street. Demonstrators climbed to the top of the building and hung signs demanding affordable housing. =23 July 2011 (Tel Aviv protest rally)= On the evening of the July 23, 2011, tens of thousands of demonstrators participated in a protest rally held in the center of Tel Aviv and initiated by the housing protest organizers. A demonstration was held, followed by a mass march from the tent compound at Habima Square to the Tel Aviv Museum of Art Plaza, where the main rally was held. Following the rally, protesters blocked the intersection of Ibn Gabirol and Dizengoff streets. A police official estimated that over 20,000 people participated in the protests. A clash broke out after police detained one participant, prompting a crowd of demonstrators to block the intersection of Kaplan and Ibn Gabirol Streets. Demonstrators camped in the middle of the intersection and barricaded it with barriers from nearby repair works. The crowd chanted slogans in favor of the police, and explained to police that they, too, could not afford decent housing with their salaries, and encouraged policemen to demand the right to unionize, which Israeli police officers are banned by law from doing. Police cleared the junction using selective arrests. The police effort involved mounted police and officers on motorcycles. The protesters initially threw beer cans, but quickly resorted to chanting pro-police and pro social justice slogans, and calling for revolution and non-violence. The demonstrators then attempted to march up Dizengoff Street to the nearest police station in solidarity with the detained, but were blocked and thinned out by police, who used limited force and selective arrests. The demonstration broke up, and the protesters returned to the tent camp. A total of 43 demonstrators were arrested and about 200 were detained.Protesters block streets in Tel Aviv after landmark rally The 43 arrested demonstrators subsequently appeared before the Tel Aviv Magistrates' Court, of which 32 were released after they were questioned and signed documents prohibiting them from entering a large area surrounding Rothschild Boulevard or taking part in the protests for 30 days. The remaining 11, all members of Anarchists Against the Wall, were released after signing papers banning them from entering central Tel Aviv and from attending the tent protests for 7 days. One of them was also charged with throwing a smoke grenade at police, and another was charged with assault.43 arrested in Tel Aviv rally, banned from protest site =24‚Äì29 July 2011= On 24 July 2011, a protest broke out in Jerusalem, with over 1,000 demonstrators marching towards the Knesset, or Israeli parliament. The demonstration caused major traffic disruptions, and passed by Beit Aghion, the official residence of the Prime Minister, with local residents being urged to join in. One demonstrator was arrested after attempting to enter the Knesset compound. The same day, Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu declared that he will meet with protest organizers that week, in order to find \\"housing solutions for young couples and IDF veterans.\\" On 25 July 2011, demonstrators blocked roads in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Haifa, and Rosh HaAyin, while demonstrations were held in Beersheba and Rishon LeZion. Protest leaders said that police authorized the blocking of roads for twenty minutes in the afternoon, a claim denied by police. In some instances, protesters left roads on their own initiative, while others were cleared by police. In Haifa, ten demonstrators were cleared by police in the Merkaz HaCarmel area, and patrol cars were stationed in the vicinity. In Tel Aviv, the encampment on Rothschild Boulevard was largely deserted, with protesters either escaping the midday heat or leaving for Jerusalem to join the protests there. Two large demonstrations took place in Jerusalem's Paris Square, across from Beit Aghion, the Prime Minister's residence. Protesters laid down on a road near Paris Square to block it, and were dispersed by police, who arrested eight demonstrators for disturbing the peace. Demonstrators attempted to build a brick wall across the entrance road to the Knesset building. The wall was about three rows high when police demolished it. A female demonstrator was later arrested after arriving with more bricks and emptying them across a road. Five demonstrators were arrested for blocking traffic in the city. Police dispersed protesters blocking traffic, arresting five, while one police officer was injured. The protesters later moved to Horse Park on King George Street to set up a tent camp. A group of ultra-Orthodox demonstrators from the \\"Israel is Right\\" coalition continued demonstrating outside the Knesset after the students left. Later, 100 protesters from the National Union of Israeli Students knocked on the doors of the offices of Knesset members to explain to them why they should oppose the government's bill to expedite building plans, calling for a significant number of the homes the bill would provide to be small and affordable. Another dozen students met with Knesset Speaker Reuven Rivlin. On 26 July 2011, Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu announced new housing programs aimed at addressing the housing shortage in Israel and at supporting the students. The protest movement dismissed the plan for not meeting their demands, and stated that the protests would continue. One demonstrator told Ynetnews that the protests demanded a comprehensive solution for persons such as students, renters, and young couples, while a member of the Educators' Kibbutzim of the Dror Israel Movement told Ynet that \\"we don't need privatization- what we need is development funds and (government) investment in the periphery\\". The National Union of Israeli Students released a statement welcoming the plan, but announcing that they would continue to protest. During the press conference where Prime Minister Netanyahu announced the new plan, some fifty activists protested outside the Prime Minister's office, chanting \\"Bibi, we're not buying your spin\\". In Parliament, members of the Labor and Kadima parties criticized the plan. Opposition chairwoman Tzipi Livni of Kadima stated that Netanyahu was \\"taking down tents, not building homes\\", and that \\"he doesn't understand that the problem isn't technical, but fundamental. The middle class needs to be unburdened, and for that the national policy must be changed. Marginal solutions are not enough\\". Later, some 700 protesters gathered in Haifa's Park Haim for a rally. Following the rally, some demonstrators attempted to block a nearby street, and police arrested seven. A similar rally was held in the Hatikva Quarter of Tel Aviv, and HaEtzel Street was partially blocked. In Ashdod, hundreds of residents demonstrated in the streets. On 27 July, students in Tel Aviv marched from the encampment at Rothschild Boulevard towards the city's government buildings, wearing red shirts and beating on garbage bins with sticks. In Jerusalem, some 150 protesters, mainly university students and social activists, marched to one of Prime Minister Netanyahu's private apartments, and announced that they would \\"put it up for sale\\", as it was not in use. Along the route, the protesters disrupted traffic on several occasions and for a few minutes blocked the road leading to the Prime Minister's official residence, and police set up roadblocks in the area to prevent activists from approaching the site. Later, demonstrators passed an apartment building which they claimed was empty due to the owners residing overseas. During their walk, the marchers were accompanied by police. Arab citizens of Israel joined the protests, with residents of the Arab city of Baqa al-Gharbiyye setting up a tent encampment and hanging protest signs on tents. Members of the city's Public Committee and a local youth movement participated, as did Arab Knesset members Jamal Zahalka and Mohammed Barakeh. Meanwhile, authorities began to take action to dismantle the tent encampments. In Beersheba, police dispersed protesters that had pitched tents before the city's municipality building. In Netanya, organizers of a protest there claimed that authorities were trying to evict them from their protest spot in front of luxury towers in an upscale neighborhood, with inspectors handing out tickets to their supporters in vehicles. In Tel Aviv, municipality inspectors arrived at a 15-tent encampment in Levinsky Park to hand out eviction orders, which claimed that pitching a tent in a public park without a permit was illegal. On 28 July, thousands of Israeli parents took part in a \\"strollers march\\" across Israel, protesting what they termed the high cost of raising a child in Israel. In particular, demonstrators were protesting against the exaggerated fees charged by daycare centers and nursery schools, as well as the overall high prices of basic products for babies and children. Parents showed up with strollers, tying a yellow balloon to them, with many bringing their children. The main protest rally took place in Tel Aviv, where over 4,000 people participated. Some 600 others marched in Ra'anana, 300 in Haifa, with protests also taking place in Yehud, Ness Ziona, Kfar Saba, Ashdod, and Rishon LeZion.Parents stage 'strollers protest' ‚Äì Israel News, Ynetnews.

Thousands of people marched in the parade, which began in Independence Park and headed towards the Knesset compound. Police secured the demonstration, and arrested a Hasidic man trying to throw stink bombs at the protest. Some 20 ultra-Orthodox and right-wing activists at the International Convention Center protested against the march.Hasson, Nir.

On 28 July, hundreds of people in Tel Aviv demonstrated against the high cost of living, blocking a road on the corner of King Saul and Ibn Gabirol streets, waving Israeli flags and protest signs, many of them reading \\"land of milk and taxes\\". On 29 July, some twenty Tel Aviv University students marched from Rothschild Boulevard to the luxury Tzameret Towers in northern Tel Aviv, and demonstrated outside the luxury towers, throwing stink bombs and releasing balloons.Jerusalem Post - National News =The July 30th protest rallies= On 30 July, between 85,000 (police estimation) and 150,000 people (organizers estimation) took part in demonstrations in the streets against the social policies of the Netanyahu government, chanting slogans denouncing the government and calling for social justice. Demonstrations were held in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Haifa, Beersheba, Kfar Saba, Ra'anana, Baqa al-Gharbiya, Ashdod, Nazareth, Kiryat Shmona, Modi'in-Maccabim-Re'ut, Kfar Saba, Netanya, Ashkelon, Tiberias, the Savion Junction, and the Jordan Valley. Police sources said that in all, about 150,000 people took part in the protests. In Tel Aviv alone, about 80,000 participated in the demonstration, which was so large that hundreds of police officers, including the sector commander, were deployed to secure it. Some 10,000 demonstrators participated in Jerusalem and 12,000 in Haifa. =31 July= On 31 July in Tel Aviv, hundreds of people continued to protest after the official rally ended, blocking the city's Kaplan and Ibn Gabirol Streets. The protest was secured by police officers, including mounted police. After the protest had gone on for hours, police declared the gathering illegal and forcibly dispersed it after failing to negotiate a peaceful end. Central Control Unit officers formed a human chain to push demonstrators back and break up clusters of people blocking the roads. The protesters responded with verbal abuse, and several rioted.

Eyewitnesses claimed that they were members of the far-left Anarchists Against the Wall group, and a right-wing activist claimed that the two had arrived \\"drunk and violent\\". He also claimed that he and other rightists had been harassed by the two activists since they arrived, and that they had tried to hurt them but were chased away the previous night. In Modi'in-Maccabim-Re'ut, 22 residents set up a tent camp and protested in front of the home of Knesset member Yariv Levin, who voted in favor of the National Housing Committees Law, which was strongly opposed by protesters.

Importance  Excavated from 1967 to 1974, the wall paintings provide a crucial window into Santorini's history, depicting the early Aegean world as a highly developed society. Of all the findings unearthed at Akrotiri, these frescoes constitute the most significant contribution to present-day knowledge of Aegean art and culture. In their technique, style, and thematic content, the paintings are invaluable objects of study for archaeologists, art historians, zoologists, botanists, and chemists. Originally displayed on the walls of ancient Theran aristocratic estates, the paintings render ancient figures, customs and historical events. Cycladic Town Fresco, Akrotiri, Thera. Cycladic Town Fresco, Akrotiri, Thera.  Technique and Palette  To prepare the stone walls of the buildings for frescoes, the walls were first covered with a mixture of mud and straw, then thinly coated with lime plaster and lastly layers of fine plaster. The palette of the paintings consists of white (from the lime plaster), red (derived from ferrous earths and haematite), yellow (from yellow ochre), blue (either Egyptian blue, purple, or possibly azurite), and mineral black. The ancient Theran artists made full use of their colors: yellow was used for the golden fur of lions or the skin of youths, and as a stand-in for light green for painted plants such as myrtle. Blue was used as a dark gray to indicate birds, animal pelts, fish scales, and the shaven heads of young figures. Deep blue was also used to suggest the deep green of ivy, papyrus, lily, reeds, and palm trees. White indicated the pale skin of female figures while red was used for the darker, sun-tanned skin of males. Christos Doumas, The Wall-Paintings of Thera (Athens: Thera Foundation, 1992), 18.

Design and development The Gemini was designed to explore the use of flaps to create a variable geometry sailplane that would be optimized for both low speed thermalling flight and also high speed gliding between thermals. The aircraft was predominantly made from aluminium, with some stainless steel used for the wing ribs, controls and fittings. The two-place side-by-side cockpit was made from fibreglass. Its four-piece span high aspect ratio wing employed a modified Wortmann FX-61-163/35SF airfoil. The Fowler flaps occupied the entire trailing edge of the wing and accounted for 35% of the wing chord. In cruise the flaps were retracted, reducing the wing area. While climbing, the flaps were extended, producing a high lift coefficient of 2.2. For glidepath control when landing the flaps deployed to 80¬∞ to create aerodynamic drag. The outer flaps acted as slotted ailerons for roll control. Only one Gemini was built. The aircraft is still operational and as of August 2011, owned by Gary Osoba of Wichita, Kansas, United States. Operational history The aircraft was flown to set seven Canadian multi-place records, including the record for speed over a triangle. It was also used to set the US national record for the of . On July 2, 2011, Osoba and his wife Christine flew the Gemini on a free distance flight from Zapata, Texas to just east of Amarillo, Texas, a flight which won the 2011 Barringer Trophy.

Museum ships and boats, surviving hulls  = Lakers: bulk carriers = MV Maumee, used to be one of the oldest active bulk freighters on the Lakes, until she was scrapped in 2012. Here she is, unloading in alt=Gray freighter unloading at dockside Lake freighters, or lakers, are bulk carrier vessels which ply the Great Lakes. The best-known variety is the oreboat, depicted in songs from Gordon Lightfoot, Stan Rogers and others. Some classic-design lakers still operate, including a few with steam engines.  SS Col. James M Schoonmaker (Toledo, Ohio)  Col. James M. Schoonmaker sailed from 1911 to 1980. She was first owned by the Shenango Furnace Company under her present name and was sold to the Cleveland-Cliffs Iron Company, which renamed her Willis B Boyer. Col. James M. Schoonmaker was the largest bulk freighter in the world when commissioned. In an ambitious restoration, Col James M. Schoonmaker was re-christened with its original name July 1, 2011, on the 100th anniversary of the ship's launching in Toledo, Ohio. In October 2012, she was moved with great fanfare from her longtime berth at International Park in Toledo downriver to a site next to the new home of the National Museum of the Great Lakes. Ship and museum are scheduled to open to the public in Spring 2014.  SS William G Mather (Cleveland, Ohio)  William G. Mather was a laker built in 1925 and a former flagship for the Cleveland-Cliffs Iron Company. It is now a maritime museum, open to the public, in Cleveland's North Coast Harbor.  SS William A Irvin (Duluth, Minnesota)  alt=Gray barge sailing under a bridge was named for the president of U.S. Steel at the time of its launching. It was the first laker with a welded design, and served as the flagship of US Steel's Great Lakes fleet from her launch in 1938 until 1975. It is open for tours at the Great Lakes Floating Maritime Museum in Duluth.  SS Meteor (1896‚ÄîSuperior, Wisconsin)  is the last surviving ship using whaleback design; she is a museum in Superior, home of the American Steel Barge Company (where 33 out of the 44 total whalebacks were built starting in 1891).  SS Valley Camp (Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan)  was a typical oreboat, who served the National Steel Corporation, Republic Steel Corporation and Wilson Transit Co. during her 1917‚Äì1966 working life. In 1968, she became a museum ship on the waterfront of Sault Ste. Marie, downstream of the Soo Locks. She holds many relics from (including two of Edmund Fitzgeralds mauled lifeboats). =Passenger-freight steamers=  SS Keewatin (Port McNicoll, Ontario)  is a former Canadian Pacific passenger liner. Built in Scotland in 1907, the boat steamed between Fort William and Port McNicoll for over 50 years until she was sold for scrap in 1967. Saved from the wrecker's torch, Keewatin was towed to Saugatuck, Michigan for use as a museum in 1968. She is the last unmodified Great Lakes passenger liner in existence, and an example of Edwardian luxury. Keewatin is one of the world's last coal-fired steamships. A June 24, 2007 Toronto Star article documented a Canadian effort to see the steamer returned to Dominion waters as a museum ship at Port McNicoll. The effort to repatriate \\"The Kee\\" bore fruit on June 23, 2012 (100 years to the day after she first entered Port McNicoll), when the ship returned to her former berth before a crowd of thousands.  SS Milwaukee Clipper (Muskegon, Michigan)  , another passenger steamer, was built in 1904. She served as a passenger-package freighter for the Pennsylvania Railroad marine division (the Anchor Line) as the steamer Juniata. In 1940, after several years of layup, she was sold and converted to an excursion steamer between Muskegon and Milwaukee. Laid up again in the 1970s, she lingered for 30 years before returning to Muskegon as a museum.  MS Norgoma (Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario)  MS Norgoma, berthed in the Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, was built as a steamer carrying freight and passengers in 1950. She ran from Owen Sound to Sault Ste. Marie from 1950 to 1963 on the \\"Turkey Trail\\". In 1963 Norgoma was converted to a car ferry, her former role taken over by trucks, buses and automobiles, and she ran between Tobermory and Manitoulin Island. At this time, Norgoma was converted to diesel power. She became a museum ship in 1977.  SS Norisle (Manitoulin Island, Ontario)  is a museum ship berthed permanently at the Manitowaning Heritage Complex. It is one of three surviving ships, the others being Norgoma and Normac. It was built in 1946, the first ship built in post-World War II Canada using engines intended for a Royal Canadian destroyer. Norisle ran until 1974, when it was replaced by MS Chi- Cheemaun. Plans call for towing and scuttling Norisle as a tourist dive site. A 200-member group, Friends of The Norisle, has formed to oppose her sinking and supportive articles and letters to the editor have appeared in the Manitoulin Expositor. =Passenger and excursion steamers=  SS Columbia (Detroit, Michigan)  is a former Boblo Island excursion boat, built in 1902, which has been in storage since 1991. A New York City group intends to save Columbia and use it on the Hudson River, like the old Hudson day steamers (all of which have been lost).  SS Ste Claire (Detroit)  , a former Boblo Island excursion boat, was built in 1910. Like her Bob-Lo Amusement Park running mate Columbia, she was designed by Frank Kirby. In July, 2018 an apparently accidental fire destroyed most of her remaining wooden superstructure. Her future afterward was unassuaged. =Railroad and auto ferries=  SS City of Milwaukee (Manistee, Michigan)  was a railroad ferry of the Grand Trunk Milwaukee Car Ferry Company which was built in 1931 to replace a previous ferry (, lost in 1929 with all hands). She sailed for the company for 40 years (and another five for the Ann Arbor Railroad) before laying up in Frankfort in 1982, where she remained until being sold as a museum. Later moved to her present berth in Manistee, she is open for tours as the last unmodified, classic railroad ferry.  Trillium (Toronto, Ontario)  The side-wheel steam ferry (1910), reactivated in 1976, calls Toronto home. Several vintage 1930s screw ferries serve alongside her. =Tugboats and workboats= Their small size and hardy construction make tugboats a favorite as museum ships. Their smaller size means lower maintenance costs (and maintenance can often be performed by volunteer crews). Three steam tugs survive, in addition to three former Army tugs later used for other purposes.  Steam tug Edna G (Two Harbors, Minnesota)  The steam tugboat Edna G is in retirement as a floating display. Built in 1896, it was one of the last operating steam tugboats on the Great Lakes and is on the National Register of Historic Places.  Steam tug Ned Hanlan (Toronto)  The steam tug has been preserved ashore as a static display on the grounds of the Canadian National Exhibition. Launched in 1932, the tug is one of three preserved Great Lakes steam tugs (the others are James Whalen and Edna G. It was named for the rower Ned Hanlan.  United States Army tug LT-5 (Oswego, New York)  The former World War II United States Army tugboat Major Elisha K. Henson, built in 1943, participated in the Normandy landings. An operational floating display, it worked as a commercial tug (Nash) for 30 years.  United States Army Corps tug Bayfield (Duluth, Minnesota)  alt=Tugboat at dockside, with three workers watching waves break over a sea wall A United States Army Corps of Engineers tugboat, Bayfield, serves as a popular photo shoot at Duluth's Canal Park.  United States Army Corps Tug Ludington (Kewaunee, Wisconsin)  The former United States Army Corps of Engineers tugboat Ludington, built as an Army tug in 1943, also partook in the D-Day invasion at Normandy. A non- operational floating display, it is supervised by ex-Major Wilbur Browder.  Tug John Purves (Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin)  The 1919 tug Butterfield was built for World War I, but was sold for the Lake Superior pulpwood trade. During World War II, the boat was taken into government service as the USAT Butterfield, LT-145, serving in the Gulf of Alaska and the Bering Sea. The Roen Steamship Company acquired the tug, renaming it John Purves (after the firm's general manager) and using it as a salvage vessel. It was later donated to the Door County Maritime Museum.John Purves Tour video, Jul 15, 2011, Explore the Door, Door County Visitor Bureau  Steam tug James Whalen (Thunder Bay, Ontario)  The 1905 icebreaking tugboat James Whalen serves as a popular photo shoot at Kaministiquia Park. She was rescued in 1977, after she was slated for scrapping. =Naval ships= The Great Lakes are home to a large number of naval craft serving as museums (including five submarines, two destroyers and a cruiser). The Great Lakes are not known for submarine activity, but the undersea service fires the imagination of many. Three former army tugs are museums, having come to the lakes in commercial roles. USS Cobia (Manitowoc, Wisconsin) The World War II submarine is operated by the Wisconsin Maritime Museum, and is a good example of submarine restoration. It features the oldest radar set in the world. USS Cod (Cleveland, Ohio) The World War II submarine was brought to Cleveland in 1976. It is a National Historic Landmark and a memorial to the 3,900 submariners lost in their nation's service during the century of the US Navy's Submarine Force. It was awarded seven battle stars for its wartime service. USS Croaker (Buffalo, NY) The World War II submarine was brought to Buffalo in 1988, where it serves alongside USS Sullivans and USS Little Rock. It was modernized in 1953 as a hunter-killer submarine during the Cold War, and resides at the Buffalo Naval and Military Park. HMCS Haida (Hamilton, Ontario) The destroyer is one of two surviving Canadian World War II warships. USS Little Rock (Buffalo) A Cold-War-era cruiser, is one of three cruisers preserved as museum ships in the US. It resides at the Buffalo Naval and Military Park. LST-393 (Muskegon, Michigan) LST-393, a World War II tank landing ship launched in 1943, is available for tours at West Michigan Dock and Market in Muskegon. With the camouflage paint she wore at the end of the war, the ship worked as an automobile ferry between 1947 and 1973 as M/V Highway 16 (after US Route 16, which was bridged by the ship between Muskegon and Milwaukee, Wisconsin). It was awarded three battle stars for war service. HMCS Ojibwa \\"S72\\" (Port Burwell, Ontario) S72 HMCS Ojibwa S72 was an Oberon-class submarine, laid down as HMS Onyx at Chatham Dockyard in Chatham, Kent, UK. It was purchased by Canada in 1962 and commissioned into the Canadian navy in 1965, served primarily in the Maritime Forces Atlantic until its decommissioning in 1998. USS Silversides (Muskegon) The World War II submarine was displayed at Chicago's Navy Pier. It moved to Muskegon in 1987. USS The Sullivans (Buffalo) The World War II was named for five brothers killed in the line of duty. It earned nine battle stars in World War II and two for Korean War service. It resides at the Buffalo Naval and Military Park. U-boat U-505 (Chicago, Illinois) The was captured during World War II, allowing the Allies to capture its code books and the German Enigma code machine. Slated for sinking after the war for gunnery practice, the sub was instead donated to Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry. It was later moved inside to a climate-controlled environment (undergoing an extensive restoration), and was re-opened to the public in 2005. =Large government vessels= USCGC Acacia (Manistee, Michigan) is a retired buoy tender with icebreaking capabilities serving as a museum ship moored near the railroad car ferry, SS City of Milwaukee. The World War II-vintage vessel is a tribute to the black-painted workhorses of the United States Coast Guard. A ribbon-cutting (announcing the ship's new role as a museum ship) was celebrated in Manistee on August 13, 2011. BFD Edward M Cotter (Buffalo) This 1900 Buffalo Fire Department fireboat, still in use for firefighting and icebreaking, is a National Historic Landmark.  MS Georgian Queen (Penetanguishene, Ontario)  Georgian Queen is a former Canadian Coast Guard icebreaking cutter which has been converted into a tour boat.  CCG Alexander Henry (Kingston, Ontario)  Former Canadian Coast Guard icebreaker resides at the Marine Museum of the Great Lakes as a display and a bed-and-breakfast. Launched in 1958, she and the former USCGC Mackinaw serve as the Great Lakes' two surviving large red-hulled icebreakers.  USCGC Mackinaw (Mackinaw City, Michigan)  is a vessel designed for icebreaking duties on the Great Lakes. Mackinaw was home-ported in Cheboygan, Michigan during its active service. Due to Mackinaws age and expensive upkeep, the cutter was decommissioned and replaced with a smaller multipurpose cutter (, which was commissioned in Cheboygan the same day). The old Mackinaw moved under its own power on June 21, 2006 from the port of its decommissioning to a permanent berth (at the dock) at the ship's namesake port, Mackinaw City, Michigan, where she now serves as the Icebreaker Mackinaw Maritime Museum.  USCGC McLane (Muskegon, Michigan)  McLane was a \\"buck and a quarter\\" cutter designed to chase rum-runners during Prohibition. During World War II it served out of Ketchikan, Alaska and is credited with sinking the Japanese submarine RO-32. A Chicago-based Sea Scout troop acquired McLane after it was decommissioned in 1969, and the Great Lakes Naval Memorial and Museum acquired the cutter in 1993.  Port Huron Lightship  Located ashore at the head of the St Clair River in Port Huron, it is the Great Lakes' one surviving lightvessel.  At-risk vessel  The following historic museum ship did face an uncertain future: *, a former museum ship, was offered for sale by its owner (the Port Huron Museum). In November 2017, Bramble was moved to Port Huron, MI, where it currently functions as a museum ship.  Surviving partial ships  *SS Ridgetown was partially sunk as a breakwater (with stack and cabins intact) near Toronto, at Port Credit. Built in 1905 as SS William E. Corey, it is one of the oldest surviving hulls on the lake. There are only few ships older, such as the J. B. Ford. Its silhouette is an example of the appearance of early-1900s bulk carriers. *Benson Ford was named after Henry Ford's grandson, and was the 1924 flagship of the Ford Motor Company. The pilot house is located in Put-in-Bay, Ohio, a private museum residence owned by Bryan Kasper of Sandusky, Ohio. It has been featured in magazines and on television shows, such as HGtv's Extreme Homes, Mtv Cribs and the Travel Channel's Extreme Vacation Homes. The pagoda-style cabin of the Ford provides a glimpse of what one of the largest freighters on the lakes looked like. *The steamer Lewis G Harrimans bow and bow superstructure are preserved in Detour, Michigan. Lewis G Harriman (launched as the purpose-built cement steamer John W Board) was scrapped, but the bow was saved as a residence. It was restored in the Board's colors. *The pilot house of William Clay Ford is part of the Dossin Great Lakes Museum on Belle Isle, Detroit. The bulk freighter was built in 1952 and scrapped in 1987. *The past warship, converted into a Great Lakes freighter, SS Joseph H Thompsons pilot house was removed when being converted to a barge. *SS Amasa Stone was partially sunk as a breakwater at Charlevoix, Michigan. She was built in 1905, and she is one of the oldest surviving hulls on the Great Lakes. Before sinking everything was removed from the ship including the Superstructure. *SS William H. Donner was a Great Lakes bulk freighter that was built in 1914. She was decommissioned in 1970 and was turned into a stationary crane ship that functioned until 2015 when the ship was towed to the Menominee river awaiting scraping. *SS William Edenborn was a long Great Lakes bulk freighter that was built in 1900 and she was given the title Queen of the Lakes due to her length. She sailed from 1900, to 1962 when she was sunk as a breakwater at Cleveland, Ohio where she was buried under 39 feet of dredgings from the Cuyahoga River. *SS Howard L. Shaw was a long Lake freighter that was built in 1900 by the Detroit Shipbuilding Company of Wyandotte, Michigan, for the Eddy-Shaw Transit Company of Bay City, Michigan. She was sunk on July 4, 1960 in Ontario Place where she remains to this day. She is the oldest surviving hull on the Great Lakes. *The pilot house from the Thomas Walters survives as part of the Ashtabula Maritime & Surface Transportation Museum in Ashtabula, Ohio. It's noted that the Walters was the freighter built to replace the SS William C. Moreland , which ran aground on Sawtooth Reef, Lake Superior.  Failed museum attempts (ships scrapped) Several other lakers nearly became museums but, due to funding, political opposition or other causes, were scrapped: *SS Alabama: Goodrich Transit Line steamer later cut down as a barge, scrapped in 2009 *SS Canadiana: Crystal Beach Park boat scrapped after preservationist opposition * Three-masted schooner SV : Built in 1846 for the lumber trade, she sank in Green Bay in 1864. She was raised in 1965 and brought to Menominee, Michigan as a museum. After years of neglect, she was dismantled in 1998. *SS John Ericsson: The penultimate whaleback freighter, John Ericsson was scrapped in 1969 in Hamilton, Ontario. Politics, as was the case with Canadiana, played a central role in the loss of the ship. *Wrecking tug Favorite: The Great Lakes' best- known salvage tug, likened to SS Foundation Franklin in the Canadian Maritimes. An attempt to save it at Sault Ste. Marie (next to failed when state funding failed to materialize and the riveted hull began to leak. She was scrapped in Detour Township, Michigan. *Lewis G Harriman: A 1923 purpose- built cement carrier, the first of her kind, which sailed from her launch until 1980. Used as a storage barge until 2003, a group tried to save her; however, poor communications within the company saw the ship sold in 2004 and scrapped in Sault Ste. Marie by Purvis Marine. The majority of the hull was fed to the Algoma Steel Mill but the forecastle was saved as a summer cottage at Detour, Michigan. *Lansdowne and Huron: The paddlewheel steam railroad ferry Lansdowne, built in 1884, was modified to support a restaurant in antique rail cars; Huron, built in 1875, sank at a pier in Erie, Pennsylvania. The hull was raised, but little other information about the future of the vessel is available. The hull was towed to Buffalo, New York in July 2006; however, in winter 2008 Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown called it an eyesore and demanded its removal. Lansdowne was scrapped in July 2008. *SS Niagara: Built in 1897, the freighter was later converted into a sand-sucker. Scrapped in 1997 by Liberty Iron & Metal in Erie, Pennsylvania (after a failed attempt to convert her into an Erie museum), she had been saved from the scrapyard 11 years earlier. *SS Seaway Queen: The Canadian straight decker Seaway Queen, formerly owned by Upper Lakes Shipping, was involved in an attempt to save her as a museum. The company failed to locate an organization capable and willing to preserve her; she was sold and scrapped in Alang, India in 2004. *SS Chief Wawatam: A historic icebreaker and the last hand-fired coal steamer on the Great Lakes, Chief Wawatam was cut down to a barge and finally scrapped by its owner (Purvis Marine of Sault Ste Marie, Ontario). * Three-masted schooner J.T. Wing: Last commercial sailing ship on the Great Lakes, she was used briefly in the lumber trade.

He previously played for the Seattle Mariners from 2013 to 2018. Paxton played college baseball for the Kentucky Wildcats. He was drafted in the fourth round of the 2010 MLB draft by the Mariners and made his MLB debut for them in 2013. On May 8, 2018, Paxton pitched a no-hitter against the Toronto Blue Jays, becoming the first Canadian major league pitcher to throw a no-hitter in Canada. Following the 2018 season, Paxton was traded to the Yankees. Amateur career =North Delta Blue Jays= Paxton attended Delta Secondary School in Ladner, British Columbia. He played for the North Delta Blue Jays of the British Columbia Premier Baseball League (PBL) and for Team Canada at the Junior National level. In his junior year, Paxton won 10 games and had a 1.51 earned run average (ERA) to go along with 100 strikeouts in 78 innings pitched. This led to him being named the top pitcher of the PBL and a first-team All-Star. After starting his senior year injured, Paxton finished the year with a 7‚Äì1 win‚Äìloss record and 65 strikeouts and 32 walks in 50 innings pitched. Both years Paxton and the Blue Jays won the league title and the B.C.'s Best Tournament. =University of Kentucky= After graduating from high school in 2006, Paxton attended the University of Kentucky, where he played college baseball for the Kentucky Wildcats baseball team in the Southeastern Conference (SEC). As a freshman, he led the Wildcats in appearances with 25 and had a 2‚Äì0 record in relief with one save. In 2008 as a sophomore, Paxton worked his way into the starting rotation midway through the season and earned 11 starts while making 17 appearances. He finished the year 4‚Äì2 with a 2.92 ERA. That same year Paxton pitched a complete-game shutout over Ole Miss to win the SEC Tournament earning him SEC Pitcher of the Week. Due to injury, he did not participate in the NCAA Tournament. That summer Paxton was invited to play collegiate summer baseball in the Alaska Baseball League where he pitched in four games with three starts, finishing with a 1‚Äì0 record and a 2.25 ERA in 16 innings. He struck out 12 batters and allowed opponents to hit just .179 against him. Paxton started 13 games in 2009, finishing 5‚Äì3 with 115 strikeouts (5th best in school history) in innings. He drew the attention of Major League Baseball scouts as he was considered a possible first-round draft pick. Paxton was drafted by the Toronto Blue Jays in the first round (37th overall) of the 2009 Major League Baseball Draft. However, he did not sign with the Blue Jays opting to return to Kentucky for his senior season; the NCAA subsequently ruled him ineligible, stemming from his contact with agent Scott Boras. Paxton was named to the SEC Academic Honor Roll every year he was at Kentucky. He held a 3.3 GPA heading into his senior year as an accounting major. Professional career = Grand Prairie AirHogs= After being ruled ineligible to return to Kentucky, Paxton signed with the Grand Prairie AirHogs in the independent American Association in 2010. There, he went 1‚Äì2 with a 4.08 ERA and striking out 18 batters in innings. =Seattle Mariners= In June 2010, Paxton was drafted by the Seattle Mariners in the fourth round of the 2010 Major League Baseball Draft. He signed with the Mariners on March 4, 2011. In the 2011 season, Paxton played for Single A Clinton LumberKings and the Double A Jackson Generals of the Southern League. He finished with a 6‚Äì3 win‚Äìloss record, 2.37 ERA, 131 strikeouts, and 43 walks in 95 innings pitched, while allowing an opposing batting average of .215. Paxton, along with Alex Liddi, represented the Mariners at the 2011 All-Star Futures Game. Paxton was invited to attend the Mariners' main spring training camp in 2012, but did not make the opening day roster. He was sent to the Jackson Generals. Paxton with the Mariners in 2017 In 2013, Paxton played for the Tacoma Rainiers of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League. With the Mariners' coaching staff, he worked to change his pitching mechanics to mirror that of Clayton Kershaw, resulting in an improvement in his performance. On September 3, 2013, Paxton was promoted to the major leagues. His first major league appearance came on September 7 when he started against the Tampa Bay Rays. He earned the win as the Mariners won 6‚Äì2. Paxton finished with a 3‚Äì0 record in 4 starts. Paxton began the 2014 season in the Mariners rotation, but after his first start of the season, he was placed on the disabled list. He would finish the season appearing in only 13 starts due to an extended stint on the disabled list. His injury woes would continue into the 2015 season, during which he would appear in only 13 starts for the second consecutive season. In 2016, Paxton was in competition for a rotation spot in spring training, but after posting an ERA of over 9, he was optioned to AAA. He was recalled a few months later after F√©lix Hern√°ndez landed on the disabled list. Paxton started the 2017 season for the Mariners with 0.00 ERA over his first three starts. He won the American League Player of the Week Award for April 10‚Äì16 after pitching a combined 15 scoreless innings in two wins. On May 5, 2017, Paxton was placed on the 10-day disabled list due to a left forearm strain. Paxton pitched exceedingly well in July, going 6‚Äì0. He and Adri√°n Beltr√© were the co-winners of the American League Player of the Week Award for July 24‚Äì30, and he was also the AL Pitcher of the Month for July. However, on August 10, Paxton strained his left pectoral muscle pitching against the LA Angels, putting him on the disabled list once again. He tied for the major league lead in wild pitches, with 15.Yearly League Leaders & Records for Wild Pitches  Baseball-Reference.com In 2018, before his start against the Minnesota Twins, Paxton gained national media attention when a bald eagle, which had been participating in a patriotic pre-game ceremony, flew around and landed on Paxton.https://mashable.com/2018/04/06/bald-eagle- lands-on-marniers-pitcher-james-paxton/#9cEpZ.HyeiqO Paxton, who reacted unusually calmly, later stated, \\"No, I wasn't going to run. I figured I'm not going to outrun an eagle, so I might as well see what happens.\\" On May 2, 2018, against the Oakland Athletics, Paxton struck out a career-high 16 batters, but the bullpen behind him faltered, and the Mariners lost 3‚Äì2. On May 8, 2018, Paxton threw a no-hitter against the Toronto Blue Jays. He threw 99 pitches while issuing three walks in a 5‚Äì0 victory. He was the second Canadian to throw a no-hitter, being the first since Dick Fowler of the Philadelphia Athletics did so on September 9, 1945 vs. the St. Louis Browns. He is also the first Canadian Major League pitcher to throw a no-hitter in Canada, and the first Seattle Mariner to throw a no-hitter in a road game. He was placed on the disabled list on July 13, 2018 with a back injury. He finished the season 11‚Äì6 with a 3.76 ERA. =New York Yankees= Paxton with the Yankees in 2019 On November 19, 2018, the Mariners traded Paxton to the New York Yankees for Justus Sheffield, Dom Thompson-Williams, and Erik Swanson. In April 2019, Paxton became only the second Yankees pitcher (after David Cone in 1998) to strike out 12 or more batters in consecutive starts. In 2019 he was 15-6 with a 3.82 ERA in 29 starts, in which he struck out 186 batters in 150.2 innings (11.1 strikeouts per 9 innings). On February 5, 2020, it was revealed that Paxton underwent a microscopic lumbar discectomy to remove a peridiscal cyst. Recovery time required 3-4 months.  Pitching style  A power pitcher with a long stride and a 3/4 release from a closed position that hides most of his deliveries, comparable to a faster version of Andy Petitte, Paxton relies on a four-seam fastball that ranges in velocities in the high 90s miles per hour (MPH). He also complements his four-seam fastball with a cutter (high 80s MPH) and a knuckle curve (low 80s MPH). He has decreased the use of his sinker/changeup. His strikeout pitches are high fastballs and a low inside knuckle curve against right-handers. His increased usage of knuckle curves on the first pitch of at bats limited the amount of hits and runs that he allowed during the end of the 2019 season. However, his glove position pre-pitch made it easy for a knuckle curve to be tipped, so he now puts the glove sideways while wriggling the ball and the glove.

It achieves this by using a fractal tree index. It is scalable, ACID and MVCC compliant, provides indexing-based query improvements, offers online schema modifications, and reduces replication lag for both hard disk drives and flash memory. TokuDB is included in Percona Server, MariaDB and Nagios based opmon. Fractal tree indexes =Overview= TokuDB uses a Fractal tree index tree data structure that keeps data sorted and allows searches and sequential access in the same time as a B-tree but with insertions and deletions that are asymptotically faster than a B-tree. Fractal trees also allow for messages to be injected into the tree in such a fashion that schema changes (such as adding or dropping a column, or adding an index) can be done online and in the background. As a result, more indexes can be maintained without a drop in performance. This is because adding data to indexes tends to stress the performance of B-trees, but performs well in fractal tree indexes. =Uses= Fractal tree indexes can be applied to a number of applications characterized by near-real time analysis of streaming data. They can be used as the storage layer of a database or as the storage layer of a file system. When used in a database, they can be used in any setting where a B-tree is used, with improved performance. Examples include: network event management, online advertising networks, clickstream analytics, and air traffic control management. Other uses include accelerated crawler performance for search engines for social media sites. It can also be used to create indexes and columns online, enabling query flexibility for e-commerce personalization. It is also suited to improving performance and reducing existing loads on transactional websites. In general, it performs well in applications that must simultaneously store log file data and execute ad hoc queries. =Origins= This approach to building memory-efficient systems was originally jointly developed by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Rutgers University, and the Stony Brook University. =Role on the big data market= TokuDB is named as one of the technologies that enable big data in MySQL.

Initially working in the Gothic style, he later employed round-arched forms. He spent several years in Egypt. He acted as decorative architect to the Great Exhibition of 1851, and designed the Grimsby Dock Tower, completed in 1852.Brodie, Antonia (2001). Directory of British Architects 1834‚Äì1914. p.989 After a considerable break in his career he worked on designs for the South Kensington Museum, and designed the British embassy in Tehran. He was curator of the Sir John Soane's Museum from 1878 until his death in 1892. Early life and career Wild was born in Lincoln, the son of the watercolourist Charles Wild. Wild was articled to the architect George Basevi from 1830. After his apprenticeship, he concentrated on Gothic design, and was entrusted with the design of a country church. He was subsequently engaged on many other church projects, and six churches had been built to his design before 1840. Christ Church, Streatham Christ Church, Streatham (1841) Commissioned to build a new church at Streatham on a limited budget ‚Äì construction was intended to cost around ¬£4,000 although the expenditure eventually rose to around ¬£6,000 ‚Äì Wild abandoned the medieval English styles he had used for his earlier churches, for a design in a spare, round-arched style, based on an eclectic range of sources from around the Mediterranean. The church was built of brick, with, unusually for the date, some brick polychrome decoration, although sparingly used. It has a tall slim Italian-style campanile, with a small pyramidal spire. A contemporary reviewer wrote that \\"it has been called Moorish, Byzantine, Arabian, &c;, but we incline to think that it may more justly claim the title of 'Italian' than that Palladian modification which has so long monopolized that title in England.\\" Wild is not known to have travelled abroad by this time, but in developing this new style he would have been able to draw on the advice of friends who had, such as Owen Jones (who married Wild's sister Isabella shortly after) and Joseph and Ignatius Bonomi He would also have been able to consult recently published sources such as Jones' study of the Alhambra, a building from which some details at Streatham seem directly copied. Another influence was probably the Basilica of San Zeno, Verona. Wild showed the design for Christ Church at the Royal Academy in 1840, along with another for a church at Paddington (which was never built), in a Lombardic style, with western tower and a central cupola. In July 1841 Wild built a temporary pavilion seating 2,850 at Liverpool for the \\"Grand Dinner of the Royal Agricultural Society\\". Egypt In 1842 he went to Egypt to work as an architectural draughtsman for the Egyptologist Karl Richard Lepsius, having obtained the job through Joseph Bonomi. He left Lepsius' employment in 1844, but remained in Cairo for several years, making drawings of Islamic architecture, in which he paid particular attention to details of domestic buildings.Caspar Purdon Clark noted that Wild \\"cared more for dwellings of burgher people than for temples or palaces\\", Owen Jones later used Wild's drawings as the sole source for the chapter on Arabian design in his Grammar of Ornament, and nine of Wild's sketchbooks from this period are now in the collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum. While in Cairo he also drew up plans for a burial ground for the city's British community, which were never carried out, and in 1845 was commissioned to build the Anglican church of St Mark in Alexandria, following the rejection of a Gothic design by Anthony Salvin. Wild's church design combined features from early Christian and Islamic styles. It was completed ‚Äì without its planned campanile ‚Äì in 1854. Return to Britain Grimsby Dock Tower (1852) Wild returned to Britain in 1848, having travelled via Constantinople, Italy and Spain. During the erection of Paxton's Crystal Palace for the Great Exhibition in Hyde Park in 1851 he was appointed \\"decorative architect\\", his brother-in-law Owen Jones holding the post of superintendent of works. According to some sources, from 1851 he was \\"retained as an expert on Arabian art\\" to advise the newly established museum of the Department of Practical Art at Marlborough House, which later moved to South Kensington and eventually became the Victoria and Albert Museum. One well-informed obituary, however, dates this appointment to much later. In 1852 he designed a water tower at Grimsby, a side-project of the Museum's director, Henry Cole, modelling it after the tower of the Palazzo Publico in Siena. South Kensington The next 14 years of Wild's career remain obscure, and it appears that his professional activities were limited by illness, his only recorded design work during this time being a stained- glass window for the South Kensington Museum's Oriental Court, the interiors of which were designed by Owen Jones. In 1867, following the death of Francis Fowke, Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Scott was appointed to oversee the development of the 1851 Exhibition Commissioners' estate in South Kensington, which included the museum, and Wild emerged as his principal architectural assistant. His exact contribution to the scheme is not clear, although he is known to have designed the museum's Cast Court, and seems to have had sole responsibility under Scott for the Eastern and Western Galleries, and for the museum's branch at Bethnal Green, where he designed a new brick structure to be constructed around prefabricated elements previously erected at South Kensington. The works at South Kensington employed a hybrid round-arched style, often referred to by the German term rundbogenstil. In 1869 Wild drew up designs for chancery buildings for the British Embassy at Alexandria and for the British legation at Tehran. Only the latter was built, completed in 1876. His supervising assistant in Tehran was Caspar Purdon Clarke, one of the South Kensington architectural staff, who also, in 1872, went to Alexandria to oversee the mural decorations at Wild's church there. Later life Wild was curator of the Sir John Soane's Museum in London from 1878 to his death in 1892. He made substantial changes to the galleries at the rear of the Soane Museum to improve daylighting, but many of these have since been reversed, as more recent restorations have tried to bring the museum closer to its appearance in Soane's day. His extensive manuscripts, including drawings from his travels, are now housed in the Griffith Institute of the University of Oxford. The Victoria and Albert Museum also holds a selection of sketches by Wild. Works *All Saints, Botley, Eastleigh, Hampshire. (1836). *St James, West End, Hampshire (begun 1836).

Judgment The Court of Appeal held the discretion in awarding a bonus had to be exercised honestly and in good faith, not capriciously, arbitrarily or unreasonably. Because Mr Harkuluk was constructively and wrongfully dismissed as a result of bullying and abuse, the bonus was a part of damages and the court could predict what would be given.

History  The first establishment called Waldkater (\\"wildcat\\") was built in 1845 and subsequently altered many times. The name goes back to a story, according to which a wine adulterator had been changed into a cat as a punishment. Before it was shot by a hunter the cat was supposed to have been saved by revealing a recipe for a May Day drink (Maitrank). But because this drink was also adulterated and caused the hunter to have a hangover, the adulterator had to be saved again and now showed the hunter a hidden treasure. With this capital the hunter built the hotel as well as a monument to the adulterator. Less romantic is the story that a carter named Christoph Fessel originally built a small refreshment hut in the Bode Gorge that was soon replaced by the one-story Kleiner Waldkater. In 1852 the Gro√üer Waldkater Hotel was added, that together with the Rosstrappe, Hexentanzplatz and Zehnpfund became one of the most famous hotels in the area. The Gro√üer Waldkater later became a rest home and was then converted into a youth hostel which was renovated in 1996. The Kleiner Waldkater was used after the Second World War initially as a residence for evacuees and, later, as a works holiday home for Naumburg furniture workers. After the Wende it was turned back into a hotel.

As a surname, it may be: *Irish: a shortened form of O‚ÄôMara; *Hungarian: from a pet form of the personal names M√°ria, M√°rkus (Hungarian form of Marcus or Mark) or M√°rton (Hungarian form of Martin), or from a short form of the old ecclesiastical name Marcel; *Czech (M√°ra): from a pet form of the personal name Marek or Martin. Mara as a female first name is pronounced MAHR-ah most of the time, but can be pronounced as rhyming with Sarah in Jewish-American and Southern United States culture. It is of Hebrew origin, and the meaning of Mara is \\"bitter\\", which carries the implication \\"strength\\". Biblical: Naomi, mother- in-law of Ruth, claimed the name Mara as an expression of grief after the deaths of her husband and sons. It also means \\"Lady\\" in Aramaic, because Mar means \\"Lord\\", and is a title of bishops in the Syriac Christian church. It is also the name of a bitter lake in the Bible, and a title of the Kabbalistic sephira Binah. Mara means joy in Arabic and can be a unisex name. (Ar:ŸÖÿ±ÿ≠),in ancient Egypt it meant \\"The truth of God Ra\\" Ma for Truth ('Ma-at') and Ra the God of the Sun. May also be used as a Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Greek or Eastern European variant of Mary, Marianna, Maria, Marzanna and as a short form of Tamara. It is a variant of Maura, an Anglicization of the Irish name M√°ire, the Irish name of Mary, or the Scottish name Moira. It can also be a feminine version of Mauro, meaning a dark-skinned person. In Hindu, and Southeast Asian Buddhist cultures, it is etymologically related to the Sanskrit terms Mala (rosary), Mallika (jasmine) or Mayura (peacock) and is a unisex name or a surname, etymologically unrelated to anything demonic in Sino-Tibetan and modern Indic languages because the letters R and L are sometimes conflated (cf. in Japanese). It is a popular name in Latin America and the United States, for it has been in the top 1000 in the United States since 1950.

If officers concluded that the passengers would claim asylum once they arrived, they would be refused entry. The ERRC brought this action, alleging direct discrimination, on behalf of a group of asylum-seekers. The claimants, represented by Lester QC, said that the Government, represented by Greenwood QC, was breaching its international obligations. The Court of Appeal[2003] EWCA Civ 666, [2004] QB 811 distanced itself from the \\"but for\\" test by a majority, holding that there was no discrimination. Laws LJ dissented. Judgment The House of Lords held the system was inherently and systematically discriminatory, contrary to RRA 1976 s 1(1)(a). Roma were deliberately intensively questioned because the officers knew that practically all Czech asylum seekers were Roma. So, applying Nagarajan v London Regional Transport,[1999] ICR 877 they were treated less favourably on racial grounds, contrary to domestic and international law. Lord Steyn said the following. Baroness Hale also said that the \\"object of the legislation is to ensure that each person is treated as an individual and not assumed to be like other members of the group.\\" The legislation \\"makes no reference at all to justification in relation to direct discrimination. Nor, strictly, does it allow indirect discrimination to be justified. It accepts that a requirement or condition may be justified independently of its discriminatory effect.\\" The appeal, however, failed in that there was no international law that required the Roma to be allowed into the country before they applied for asylum.

In 1919 the seventh exhibition of the Spring Salon opened at the Crafts school in Zagreb. Exhibiting for the first time together, Milivoj Uzelac, Vilko Gecan, Marijan Trep≈°e and Vladimir Varlaj dominated the exhibit with their expressionist works. The Prague Four, as they became known, had returned to Zagreb that year from their studies at the Prague academy and the work of these young painters brought in new expressionist ideas that were to dominate the Croatian art scene of the 1920s. Together with Gecan, Uzelac and Varlaj, with whom he was later to exhibit as the Group of Four, Marijan Trep≈°e represents the link through which Miroslav Kraljeviƒá‚Äôs style evolved into expressionism. Trep≈°e‚Äôs own art moved from early expressionist and classicist inspirations to more open colour and freedom of gesture. His early work was characterised by interiors with figures, generally featuring a single woman. After 1933, he created a series of landscapes from around Zagreb and motifs from the south, and worked as a set designer for the Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb. Biography Marijan Trep≈°e was born in Zagreb on 25 March 1887. He attended the High School for Arts Crafts in Zagreb (1914‚Äì1918), where he studied under Bela ƒåiko≈° Sesija. His studies continued at the Academy of Fine Arts in Prague with Max ≈†vabinsk√Ω, then from 1920 to 1922, in Paris, at the Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re. From 1919, Marijan Trep≈°e exhibited his work at the Zagreb Spring Salon, and later as part of the Group of Four (Gecan, Trep≈°e, Uzelac, Varlaj). In 1926 he was awarded a gold medal for art in an international exhibition in Philadelphia. From 1925 until his retirement in 1956 he worked as a set designer at the Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb, and between 1926 and 1931 he taught at the National Crafts School in Zagreb. From 1950, he worked with the Zadar and Zagreb Puppet Theatres. Marijan Trep≈°e died 4 October 1964 in Zagreb.  Legacy  Trep≈°e is one of those artists who achieved his best work in his youth. Although Trep≈°e was educated at the Zagreb Academy of Bela ƒåiko≈° Sesija, his early work shows no traces of the Art Nouveau and Symbolism of his teacher. After graduating from Zagreb, in the autumn of 1918 he moved to Prague, where Milivoj Uzelac had been since 1915. Vladimir Varlaj and Vilko Gecan also arrived in Prague, meeting up with Ivo Re≈æek and Frano Kr≈°iniƒá to make the city an important reference for Croatian modern art. From there, they picked up the new ideas of secessionism and expressionism, which they brought back to Croatian art. An important influence on Trep≈°e and his contemporaries was the artist Miroslav Kraljeviƒá, who had died in 1913, aged only 27. While Kraljeviƒá had depicted wealthy gentlemen in the company of courtesans in Paris, Trep≈°e and his fellow artists in Prague showed working people. A typical scene in Trep≈°e's paintings had sombre men in hats sitting around a wooden table in a bar, playing cards and drinking, some fallen asleep where they sat. The place is obscurely lit, full of smoke, and there is usually just one woman in the company. A large retrospective exhibit of his works opened in 2010 in the Art Pavilion, Zagreb. It included works in oils, watercolour and prints, as well as some of his original designs for theatre sets. More comprehensive than the previous retrospective held at the same venue in 1975, the exhibit provided the opportunity for a new reading of Trep≈°e's work. In fact, much of his work was not generally known to the public, and this was the first showing for some of his best works. According to the art historian Zvonko Matkoviƒá, who was responsible for organizing the exhibit, Marijan Trep≈°e belongs among the most important Croatian artists of the first half of the 20th century. He was one of those who revived the style of Miroslav Kraljeviƒá, and took it closer to expressionism. Together with his contemporaries (Uzelac, Gecan and Varlaj) he brought important changes to the Spring Salon, a key part of the development of art in Croatia between the World wars. Trep≈°e's output was diverse. He is considered one of the best graphic artists in the years immediately after World War I. In the early 1920s in Paris, classicist tendencies had emerged, with the rounded solid forms which can be seen in much of Trep≈°e's art. Derain and Picasso were important references of the time. In the mid-1920s Trep≈°e began to work in stained glass for which he received many commissions. His most important work Calvary (Golgota), which in 1935 was placed in the chapel of the suffering of Jesus (Trpeƒáeg Isusa) in Zagreb. In 1925 he began work at the Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb, at a time when set design was developing in exciting new directions.

As a direct consequence of this there can be no net transfer of energy, momentum, or angular momentum between the optical field and the physical system. In contrast a non-parametric process is a process in which any part of the quantum state of the system changes.See Section Parametric versus Nonparametric Processes, Nonlinear Optics by Robert W. Boyd (3rd ed.), pp. 13-15. Temporal characteristics Because a parametric process prohibits a net change in the energy state of the system, parametric processes are \\"instantaneous\\". For example, if an atom absorbs a photon with energy E, the atom's energy increases by ŒîE = E, but as a parametric process, the quantum state cannot change and thus the elevated energy state must be a temporary virtual state. By the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle we know that ŒîEŒît~ƒß/2, thus the lifetime of a parametric process is roughly Œît~ƒß/2ŒîE, which is appreciably small for any non-zero ŒîE. Parametric versus non-parametric processes =Linear optics= In a linear optical system the dielectric polarization, P, responds linearly to the presence of an electric field, E, and thus we can write : {mathbf P} = varepsilon_0chi{mathbf E} = (n_r+in_i)^2{mathbf E}, where Œµ0 is the electric constant, œá is the (complex) electric susceptibility, and nr(ni) is the real(imaginary) component of the refractive index of the medium. The effects of a parametric process will affect only nr, whereas a nonzero value of ni can only be caused by a non- parametric process. Thus in linear optics a parametric process will act as a lossless dielectric with the following effects: * Refraction * Diffraction * Elastic scattering  Rayleigh scattering  Mie scattering Alternatively, non-parametric processes often involve loss (or gain) and give rise to: * Absorption * Inelastic scattering  Raman scattering  Brillouin scattering * Various optical emission processes  Photoluminescence  Fluorescence  Luminescence  Phosphorescence =Nonlinear optics= In a nonlinear media, the dielectric polarization P responds nonlinearly to the electric field E of the light. As a parametric process is in general coherent, many parametric nonlinear processes will depend on phase matching and will usually be polarization dependent. Sample parametric nonlinear processes: * Second- harmonic generation (SHG), or frequency doubling, generation of light with a doubled frequency (half the wavelength) * Third-harmonic generation (THG), generation of light with a tripled frequency (one-third the wavelength) (usually done in two steps: SHG followed by SFG of original and frequency- doubled waves) * High harmonic generation (HHG), generation of light with frequencies much greater than the original (typically 100 to 1000 times greater) * Sum-frequency generation (SFG), generation of light with a frequency that is the sum of two other frequencies (SHG is a special case of this) * Difference frequency generation (DFG), generation of light with a frequency that is the difference between two other frequencies * Optical parametric amplification (OPA), amplification of a signal input in the presence of a higher-frequency pump wave, at the same time generating an idler wave (can be considered as DFG) * Optical parametric oscillation (OPO), generation of a signal and idler wave using a parametric amplifier in a resonator (with no signal input) * Optical parametric generation (OPG), like parametric oscillation but without a resonator, using a very high gain instead * Spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC), the amplification of the vacuum fluctuations in the low gain regime * Optical Kerr effect, intensity dependent refractive index * Self-focusing * Kerr-lens modelocking (KLM) * Self-phase modulation (SPM), a chi^{(3)} effect * Optical solitons * Cross- phase modulation (XPM) * Four-wave mixing (FWM), can also arise from other nonlinearities * Cross-polarized wave generation (XPW), a chi^{(3)} effect in which a wave with polarization vector perpendicular to the input is generated Sample non-parametric nonlinear processes: * Stimulated Raman scattering * Raman amplification * Two-photon absorption, simultaneous absorption of two photons, transferring the energy to a single electron * Multiphoton absorption * Multiple photoionisation, near-simultaneous removal of many bound electrons by one photon See also * Nonlinear optics Notes References Optics Nonlinear optics Quantum optics ","title":"Parametric process (optics)"},{"id":"32756383","text":"Brooke Evans (1797‚Äì1862), was well known as an English nickel refiner, weapons manufacturer and geologist. Early life and education Evans was born in Birmingham, in 1797, his father being a woollendraper. On leaving school at the age of fifteen he was apprenticed to a gunmaker, and made his first acquaintance with metallurgy. Career =United States= His term of apprenticeship having expired, Evans started for the United States, and entered into partnership with a gunmaker in New York. He immigrated to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and owned a hardware business that produced muskets from March 1821 to December 1823 with John Rogers. After the partnership dissolved, Rogers entered into a lone contract with the government for an additional 5,000 muskets. He was only partially successful in this trade, and before long he abandoned it, and went off prospecting in Central America. =Central America= Here he became an indigo planter, and his business capacity speedily advanced him to the position of an indigo merchant. =England= Having made some money, Evans returned to England. In the Gulf of Mexico the captain of the ship and several of the crew were seized with yellow fever. Evans took command of the ship, and navigated her successfully to the British Isles. He afterwards purchased a small business in the glass and lead trade at Stratford-on-Avon, where he lived six years with his sister. This adventure became successful, and he saved some capital. Charles Askin, a veterinary surgeon, was a friend of Evans. He had moved to Warsaw, where some of Evans's family had ironworks. Askin there bought some spoons of a white metal called argentan by the maker. He accidentally discovered that the metal contained nickel. Askin's brother offered him the use of a laboratory in the gasworks at Leamington, of which he was the manager. There, in co-operation with Evans, he endeavoured to refine nickel from speiss (an impure mixture of cobalt, nickel, and other metals), left after the preparation of cobalt blue for painting pottery. They were successful, and Askin joined the firm of Merry & Son, manufacturers of German silver. Askin remained a partner until he gained ¬£1,000 by the venture, and with this he joined Evans. In 1835 they built works in Birmingham, where they successfully produced refined nickel from nickel-speiss. The demand for Evans & Askin's refined nickel and German silver increased, and the speiss produced by the cobalt blue manufacturers became insufficient for their requirements. =Europe= Evans resolved to explore Europe for the ores of nickel. He heard of its existence at the mines of Dobschan in Hungary, visited the place, and bought all the ore for which he could afford to pay. The ore contained half as much cobalt as nickel. As cobalt was detrimental to the German silver, and as Askin could not by his mode of refining separate these metals, they had to contend with a new set of difficulties. Experiments were made by Askin and Edward White Benson (the father of Archbishop Edward Benson). The demand for nickel was increasing. Evans & Askin discovered a process by which they obtained refined nickel in large quantities. To meet the demand Askin visited some nickel mines near Geisdal in Norway in 1847, where he died suddenly on 25 August. He was brought home and buried at Edgbaston. Evans then managed the business until his death. Death He died in 1862 and was buried near his partner in Edgbaston. Legacy The mineral Evansite was named in his honour because he provided the first specimens. This mineral was brought from Hungary in the year 1855 by Evans and was then reported to be found in some abundance in brown iron ores.

It also contains the test for indirect discrimination, based on statistical comparisons. Facts Mr Rutherford claimed that, because over 65 years old 7.6% of men and only 3.4% of women were economically active, the Employment Rights Act 1996 sections 109 and 156, which remove unfair dismissal and redundancy for over 65s, were discriminatory on grounds of sex. He argued this limit breached the TFEU article 157 (formerly article 141) because it indirectly discriminated against men. The Tribunal held that there was discrimination. The Employment Appeal Tribunal[2002] ICR 123 allowed the employer‚Äôs appeal and remitted the question to a tribunal. Again the tribunal found there was discrimination. The Employment Appeal Tribunal[2003] IRLR 858 again allowed the appeal. Judgment =Court of Appeal= Mummery LJ[2005] ICR 119 held the Tribunal had erred in selecting its pool for comparison, because it should have followed R (Seymour-Smith) v Secretary of State for Employment [2000] ICR 244. In this case the ECJ and the House of Lords said the method for comparison was, (a) take the pool as the entire workforce to whom the age limit is applicable; (b) find the number of men under 65 who are advantaged and disadvantaged; (c) find the number of women who are advantaged and disadvantaged (d) compare whether the number of advantaged men is smaller. He pointed out a difference between looking at who can comply and who cannot comply. It might be that 99.5% of men and 99% of women can comply. It is also that 1% of women and 0.5% of men cannot comply. But focus on the latter means that you can say twice as many women cannot comply. That is misleading. =House of Lords= The House of Lords held that ERA 1996 sections 109 and 156 did not have a significant enough adverse impact to be discriminatory. Within the group who were not adversely affected (98.8%) there was virtually no difference. It was men to women 1 to 1.0004 while the ratio of men to women who were adversely affected was 1.44 to 1. That was not enough either. Just because more women than men worked beyond 65 did not mean there was discrimination against men, because the difference was purely based on age. The correct approach is to look at the advantaged group, rather than the disadvantaged, though R (Seymour-Smith) v Secretary of State for Employment left open a ‚Äòdisadvantage-led approach‚Äô. In some cases it could be an alert for discrimination, but in this situation with the 1 to 1.44 ratio, it was not significant enough. So the Tribunal erred in totally ignoring the effect of an ‚Äòadvantage led approach‚Äô.

At an early age he became church member, and soon afterwards began preaching with great enthusiasm from house to house. He thus trained himself for the future work, and became very successful as a missionary. His first settlement was at Llanwrtyd, Brecknockshire, as co- pastor with the Rev. Isaac Price, from 1796 to 1799. He went in 1799 to Bangor, where his congregation had but twenty-five members, who were not able to give him 10l. a year. He often wondered what could have brought him to so poor a place, but thanked God that he had a little private means. He enlarged his own congregation and established seven new ones in the immediate neighbourhood, several of them self-supporting. In 1808 he removed to Mynyddbach, where he was again very successful. During six months, in 1828‚Äì9, he added no fewer than 650 to the membership of his churches. He died at Mynyddbach 3 March 1835.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 15, 2012. The title refers to the song \\"Be Still My Beating Heart\\" by Sting. Plot During a day out in the mall, Homer decides to dump Milhouse and Bart at a children's movie so he can eat at the food court. The boys run into the bullies (who are there to see an R-rated remake of a Hong Kong horror film called \\"Crawlspace\\") and Bart is forced to chaperone Jimbo Jones' girlfriend Shauna while she sees a Jennifer Aniston movie. Both of them leave shortly after seeing the only part of the movie that appeals to Shauna (the man's ass) and they hang out in the mall. Bart covers for Shauna when she shoplifts and when they escape from an incompetent mall cop, Shauna says that Bart is pretty cool and shows her appreciation by flashing her breasts in front of him, leaving him both traumatized and smitten with her. Both decide to enter a romantic relationship behind Jimbo's back, but he figures out what's going on soon afterwards. Both attempt to hide from a vengeful Jimbo at Comic Book Guy's store, while the bully decides to stake out Bart's home with help from an oblivious Marge, leaving Bart to come home and face Jimbo's wrath. Shauna breaks up with both of them after some good advice from Lisa, and Bart receives his punishment (being held upside down from his treehouse to have the \\"fear of God put into him\\") from Jimbo. Meanwhile, Homer is persuaded to buy a state-of-the-art treadmill from a crafty salesman. When Lisa shows Homer that he can access television shows wirelessly, he takes advantage of the machine and develops an obsession with watching an old television show called Stranded, instead of working out. Eventually Marge, in a fit of rage, gives away all the spoilers of the episodes Homer has not watched yet. He is initially furious at Marge and threatens to divorce her for ruining the episode, but a romantic evening planned by her resolves matters. Reception The episode originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 15, 2012. It was watched by approximately 4.864 million people during this broadcast. Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave the episode a C+, praising the couch gag \\"in an episode that was anything but memorable otherwise\\".  Chalkboard gag Different chalkboard gags appeared for different airings of this episode. The original U.S. broadcast version was \\"The true location of Springfield is in any state but yours\\", a response to reactions to a Matt Groening interview in which he revealed that the name of Springfield was inspired by Springfield, Oregon, which was widely misinterpreted as Groening revealing that The Simpsons Springfield was located in Oregon. Cultural references The montage featuring Simon & Garfunkel's \\"April Come She Will\\" is a reference to the 1967 film The Graduate, though the scene during the montage in which Bart and Milhouse are seen crossing the road is a reference to another Dustin Hoffman film, Midnight Cowboy.

Facts UK law allowed employers to set different occupational pension entitlement ages. Barber claimed against his employer, Guardian Royal Exchange Assurance, that he should be able to get an occupational pension at the same time as his woman co-workers. The Court of Appeal made a reference to the European Court of Justice whether this violated community law on equal treatment of the sexes. Judgment The European Court of Justice held that TFEU article 157 (now TEC article 119) precluded men and women having different age conditions for pension entitlements. Occupational pension schemes are included as pay, even though the scheme operated by a trust technically independent of the employers. It operated in partial substitution for benefits under the state social security system, even if it is with reference to a national scheme.

She was the daughter of Elias Haines, a merchant of New York, and her mother was the daughter of Robert Ogden, a distinguished lawyer of New Jersey. In 1812 she united with her mother in praying for the conversion of the world, and from that time dates her interest in foreign missions. She married, in 1821, Thomas C. Doremus, a merchant, whose wealth thenceforth was freely expended in her benevolent enterprises. In 1828, with eight ladies, she organized the Greek relief mission, and sent Jonas King to Greece to distribute supplies. Seven years later she became interested in the mission at Grand Ligne, Canada, conducted by Henriette Feller of Switzerland, and in 1860 was made president of the organization. In 1840 she began visiting the New York City prisons, and after establishing Sabbath services, used her influence in 1842 toward founding the Home for Women Discharged from Prison, which later became the Isaac T. Hopper Home, of which she became president on the death of her friend and co-founder, Catherine M. Sedgwick. Doremus aided in founding, in 1850, the House and School of Industry for Poor Women, becoming its president in 1867, and in 1854 became vice-president of the Nursery and Child's Hospital. In 1855 she assisted J. Marion Sims in his project of establishing the New York Woman's Hospital, of which she was ultimately president. During the American Civil War, she cooperated with the work carried on in the hospitals, ministering alike to the wounded from north and south. She founded, in 1860, the Woman's Union Missionary Society, designed to elevate and Christianize the women of heathen lands, and she took an active part as manager in the Presbyterian home for aged women, organized in 1866. She aided in collecting supplies to relieve the sufferers from famine in Ireland in 1869, and was for many years manager of the female branch of the City Mission and Tract Society and of the Female Bible Society. The last society in which she labored was known as the \\"Gould Memorial,\\" and had for its objects the establishment of Italian-American schools. All foreign missions, without regard to creed, shared her sympathies. She had a family of nine children of her own, and others that she adopted. Her son Robert Ogden Doremus was a noted chemist.

The street system is mostly laid out in a north-south/east-west system of roads. While most residents rely on cars, there is an extensive network of bus routes reaching many areas of the county. The Las Vegas Valley, being the one of the largest tourist destinations in the world, has a mass transportation system which favors the Las Vegas Strip. Many proposals have been made to expand the transportation system in the Las Vegas Valley including commuter rail and rapid transit. Airports Currently, the easiest, and most used method for traveling in and out of the Las Vegas Valley is by air. McCarran International Airport, the world's ninth busiest airport by traffic movements, is five miles from downtown Las Vegas, and is the only commercial airport serving the Las Vegas Valley. It serves as a \\"focus city\\" for Southwest Airlines, the largest operator in Las Vegas. McCarran consists of two terminals with a third under construction. Terminal One is used for domestic flights to and from other US cities. It contains 96 gates in four concourses. Terminal Three opened in June 2012, and added an additional fourteen gates, seven of which are to be used for international travelers to and from London, Mexico City, Frankfurt, Seoul, Toronto, Vancouver, Amsterdam and Paris (seasonally). Transportation to and from the airport is currently limited to automobiles, taxis, shuttles and buses. In late 2007 Clark County commissioners gave permission to the Las Vegas Monorail Company for an extension to McCarran International Terminal One although funding had yet to be determined. The extension was met with negativity by limo and taxi companies that had previously been the major transportation providers for arriving tourists. By 2011, funding was in doubt and the Las Vegas Monorail Company had yet to begin construction. Other airports in the Las Vegas Valley include the North Las Vegas Airport, a noncommercial airport used mostly by hobbyist pilots and small charter airlines, and Henderson Executive Airport, a noncommercial airport used mostly by business jets, and small charter airlines. A second, larger commercial airport is planned. Ivanpah Valley Airport, as it is known, is a developing relief airport between Primm and Sloan. It will be constructed on of undeveloped land previously owned by the United States Department of the Interior's Bureau of Land Management. However, as of August 2011, due to the economic downturn and lack of demand increase, the airport has been put on temporary hold and is still in the design phase. Monorail Unlike other monorails which traditionally serve as short line people movers (such as the Mexico City International Airport Monorail or the Walt Disney World Monorail System), the Las Vegas Monorail is the primary rapid transit system in Las Vegas. It was built primarily as a tourist transit system, and exclusively serves the Las Vegas Strip. The system served more than five million people in 2010. Although ridership has declined, it still remains a key piece of the Las Vegas transportation system. The system was conceived in 1993 as a connection between the MGM Grand and Bally's Las Vegas. It was completed, after many delays, in the summer of 2004 with the completion of what is known as \\"Phase One\\" of the monorail. The monorail runs between the MGM Grand and the SLS which opened in August 2014 replacing the Sahara Casino. Self-driving shuttle =Initial Pilot= In January 2017, the city of Las Vegas, fleet logistics provider, Keolis North America, and the shuttle manufacturer Navya, partnered to test a driverless shuttle in Downtown Las Vegas on Fremont Street between Las Vegas Boulevard and Eighth Street. The Navya shuttle comes equipped with LiDAR technology, GPS, cameras and odometry. Keolis is the transportation operator for the Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada and has been operating fixed route local and express transit routes in the region since 2013. The pilot test, which ran from January 11‚Äì20, 2017, is part of Las Vegas' broader efforts to create a designated area in the city's urban center for testing autonomous and connected cars. The city of Las Vegas was honored with a Smart 50 Award for this initiative. The shuttle was further sponsored for one year, from November 2017 to November 2018. This second pilot program gained international notoriety on launch day not only for the first connected infrastructure, but also because an 18-wheeler delivery truck backed into the shuttle within hours of its launch. The official City of Las Vegas statement: ‚ÄúThe autonomous shuttle was testing today when it was grazed by a delivery truck downtown. The shuttle did what it was supposed to do, in that it‚Äôs sensors registered the truck and the shuttle stopped to avoid the accident. Unfortunately the delivery truck did not stop and grazed the front fender of the shuttle. Had the truck had the same sensing equipment that the shuttle has the accident would have been avoided. Testing of the shuttle will continue during the 12-month pilot in the downtown Innovation District. The shuttle will remain out of service for the rest of the day. The driver of the truck was cited by Metro.‚Äù Intercity rail History Before Las Vegas became a tourist destination, railroads were a major industry in southern Nevada. The Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad was the first to lay track in the Las Vegas Valley. By 1905 the Los Angeles and Salt Lake had connected Salt Lake City to Southern California through Las Vegas. The railroad provided freight and passenger service to Las Vegas until it was acquired by the Union Pacific Railroad in 1921. The Union Pacific Railroad began the City of Los Angeles between Chicago and Los Angeles in 1936. This train ran until it was combined with the City of San Francisco in 1960. In 1956 the City of Las Vegas began between Los Angeles and Las Vegas. The train was renamed the Las Vegas Holiday Special and ran until it was discontinued in 1968. Amtrak operated the Las Vegas Limited between Las Vegas and Los Angeles for three months in 1976. A new service, the Desert Wind, began in 1979. The Desert Wind operated on Union Pacific tracks between Salt Lake City Denver & Rio Grande Depot and Los Angeles Union Station with a stop at the Las Vegas Amtrak station. The Desert Wind faced fierce competition from airlines and the interstate highway system. This, along with frequent delays caused by UP freight trains, made the Desert Wind unpopular. It was discontinued in 1997 and replaced by Amtrak's Thruway Motorcoach. =Current service and future plans= Currently, Amtrak Thruway Motorcoach serves Las Vegas with a bus stop at McCarran International and a bus stop in Downtown Las Vegas. There has been no commercial passenger rail service since the discontinuation of the Desert Wind in 1997. The Southern Nevada Railway operates excursion trips on former UP tracks in Boulder City. Amtrak plans for restoration of Las Vegas rail service surfaced almost immediately after the discontinuation of the Desert Wind. These plans recommended using Talgo trains between Los Angeles and Las Vegas, similar to Amtrak's Cascades route in the Pacific Northwest. This plan was never implemented and Las Vegas went without passenger rail service. Las Vegas is one of the largest metro areas in the US without passenger rail service. In 2005 DesertXpress Enterprises LLC was formed in an attempt to restore passenger rail service to Las Vegas. They officially released their plan to construct a high-speed route to SoCal later that year. In 2009, after years of environmental reports, determining right of way, and debating over what federal agency would have regulatory authority, Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood announced the official recognition of DesertXpress as a high-speed route. In early 2011, DesertXpress applied for a federal, $5 billion loan through the FRAs RRIF. If approved this would be the largest single amount loaned out since the program began. This contradicted original statements made by DesertXpress Enterprises, that they would not use any tax payer funds. This loan request came months before the final EIS was approved. Their Brightline West project is a plan to construct a high-speed route from Las Vegas to Southern California. The terminus of this line, Victorville, has been criticized due to its distance from Downtown Los Angeles, the place long considered to be the prime location for any high-speed rail terminal. Victorville, approximately 85 miles from Los Angeles, was chosen due to the exponential cost of building high-speed rail infrastructure in urban areas, such as the Los Angeles metropolitan area. A competing company, Las Vegas Railway Express, also plans to begin passenger rail service between Las Vegas and Southern California, though at lower speeds.

Life The property at 7 Union Street, Edinburgh where the artist John Ewbank lived Ewbank was born at Darlington on 4 May 1799, the son of Michael Ewbank, an innkeeper. He was adopted as a child by a wealthy uncle who lived at Wycliffe, on the banks of the River Tees, in the North Riding of Yorkshire. Intended for the Roman Catholic priesthood, he was sent to Ushaw College, from which he absconded. In 1813 Ewbank was apprenticed to Thomas Coulson, an ornamental painter in Newcastle. In around 1816 he moved with Coulson to Edinburgh, where he had some lessons with Alexander Nasmyth. He found work both as a painter and a teacher. He was nominated in 1830 one of the foundation members of the Royal Scottish Academy. Having become a success with history painting, he took to drink, and fell into poverty. In 1833 he is listed as living at 7 Union Street on the eastern fringe of the New Town in Edinburgh. He died of typhus fever in the infirmary at Sunderland, 28 November 1847. Works His sketches from nature were especially admired, and a series of 51 drawings of Edinburgh by him were engraved by W. H. Lizars for James Browne's Picturesque Views of Edinburgh (1825). He also made a reputation with cabinet pictures of banks of rivers, coast scenes, and marine subjects. As an illustrator he illustrated some early editions of Scott's Waverley Novels and one edition of Gilbert White's Natural History of Selborne. After 1829 he changed style and painted The Visit of George IV to Edinburgh, The Entry of Alexander the Great into Babylon, and Hannibal crossing the Alps. A View of Edinburgh from Inchkeith belongs to this period. Later works were painted for cash.

It is located in the eastern part of Cooke Township, Cumberland County. History The lake was created for supplying a water race to Laurel Forge by an 1830 dam on Mountain Creek. In 1855 and again in 1889, the downstream Upper Mill dam (now Eaton-Dikeman mill) was breached by downwash when the Laurel Forge breached. In 1919, the Laurel Dam breached and washed out the Hunters Run and Slate Belt branch and breached the Upper Mill dam at Mount Holly. The lake was a popular camp location. The Camp Rothrock Boy Scout facility in the area, with wooden shelters and a dining room, used Laurel Lake's beaches in 1922. In 1921, \\"Laurel Lake Park\\" was one of 26 camps built by the Civilian Conservation Corps and maintained by the state for camping tourists, and the public camp was still going strong in 1923. By 1929, the Gettysburg Academy conducted week-end camps at Laurel Dam. (A dam repair was performed in 1929.) Camp Lion was at the Laurel Dam in 1933. In 1947, sand was added to the lake's beach. Gettysburg College used the park for football camp in both 1941 (at the 1941 Carlisle YMCA Camp site) and in 1947. Camp Thompson was at the lake in 1949 and 1953. A fire burned 7 acres near the lake in 1963. In 1965 the lake was closed due to contamination and subsequently re-opened. In 1979 the Laurel Forge Pond name was designated in the USGS's Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) as feature 1178931, ). Laurel Lake was so named in 1990 (1194510, ). The lake was drained for repairs in November 1994 and then re- opened. The lake and dam underwent reconditioning in 2006‚Äì2007.

The Centre advertised for an Afro-Caribbean and Mr Marshall, a white man, was turned down for an interview. The children were 84% black.

Biography Greatrakes, born in Waterford about 1723, the eldest son of Alan Greatrakes of Mount Lahan, near Killeagh, County Cork, by his wife Frances Supple, of the neighbouring village of Aghadoe. He entered Trinity College Dublin, as a pensioner 9 July 1740, and was elected a Scholar in 1744, but did not take a degree. On 19 March 1750-1 he was admitted as a student at the Middle Temple, and was called to the Irish bar in Easter term 1761. He formally retired from the bar before 1776.Wilson, Dublin Directory (1766, 1776) He died at the Bear Inn, Hungerford, Berkshire, on 2 August 1781, on his way from Bristol to London, and was buried in Hungerford churchyard. On his tombstone was inscribed 'stat nominis umbra;' he was wrongly stated to have died in the fifty-second year of his age. In the letters of administration P. C. C., granted on 25 May 1782 to his widowed sister, Elizabeth Courtenay, who was sworn by commission, he is described as 'late of Castlemartyr in the county of Cork, a bachelor.' Junius connection Greatrakes acquired some posthumous importance from his supposed connection with the authorship of the letters of Junius. The materials of the letters were said to have been furnished by Lord Shelburne, and worked up by Greatrakes as his private secretary. Greatrakes probably gained his introduction to Lord Shelburne through Colonel Isaac Barr√©, his fellow-student at Trinity College, Dublin; that he died at Hungerford, not far from Lord Shelburne's seat, Bowood, and that his tombstone bore the Latin motto prefixed to Junius's letters. Such was the story which Wraxall says was 'confidently circulated' in his time.Historical Memoirs, ed. Wheatley, pp. 341‚Äì2 The family, especially the lady members, obligingly supplied many curious 'proofs' in further support of the case. The first public mention of Greatrakes's claim was probably in the Anti-Jacobin Review, in an extremely inaccurate letter, dated July 1799, from Charles Butler. The next published reference appeared in the Cork Mercantile Chronicle for 7 September 1804, in a communication from D. J. Murphy of Cork, who reports at third hand a story from James Wigmore that the original manuscripts of Junius had been found in Greatrakes's trunk. A later family reminiscence asserted that a Captain Stopford of the 63rd Regiment of Foot had received Greatrakes's confession of the authorship on his deathbed. Before any of the family could reach Hungerford, Stopford had fled to America with all Greatrakes's effects, including ¬£1,000 in money. No Captain Stopford is in the army lists. A third communication appeared in the Gentleman's Magazine for December 1813.vol. lxxxiii. pt. ii. p. 547 The writer, who signs himself 'One of the Pack,' states that Greatrakes had made the acquaintance of a judge by defending a friendless soldier, and thus been introduced to Lord Shelburne, 'in whose house he was an inmate during the publication of the letters of Junius.' The writer enclosed an autograph 'Will Greatrakes,' cut from a book that had been in his possession, of which a facsimile appeared at p. 545. In 1848, John Britton reproduced all these absurdities as authentic facts in a work entitled 'The Authorship of the Letters of Junius elucidated.' He held that Barr√© was Junius, probably inspired by Shelburne and Dunning, and that Greatrakes was the amanuensis employed. There is no evidence that he was ever in Shelburne's family.cf. Dilke, Papers of a Critic, ii. 2, 3‚Äì4 Britton based his opinion on the facsimile of Greatrakes's signature in the Gentleman's Magazine. Chabot specified several points of difference between the handwriting of Greatrakes and Junius, and the whole story is inconsistent and absurd.Chabot and Twisleton, The Handwriting of Junius professionally investiqated, pp. l‚Äìli. 203-7 References 1723 births 1781 deaths Irish barristers Scholars of Trinity College Dublin ","title":"William Greatrakes"},{"id":"32756920","text":"The following is a list of characters who first appeared in the Channel 4 soap opera Hollyoaks in 1999, by order of first appearance.

When Beth overhears Lucy Benson (Kerrie Taylor) arguing with Rob about his actions, Beth ends their relationship. When Luke reveals that he has been raped, he, Beth and Sue go on holiday to France. Luke and Sue later return and reveal that Beth has decided to stay in France after becoming engaged. Two years later, Beth returns home. She is raped by footballer Scott Anderson (Daniel Hyde) (see Hollyoaks: Indecent Behaviour). Beth decides not to tell anyone, but eventually confides in Luke before he leaves for Canada. Beth works with journalist Alyson Turner (Sarah Jayne Steed) to incriminate Scott for rape. After releasing her story to the press, Beth has to tell Andy and Sue about her rape, who promise to stand by Beth. Beth's case reached court, where Scott is acquitted of rape. Beth becomes focused on revenge towards Scott; she receives support from Sam \\"O.B.\\" O'Brien (Darren Jeffries) and they have sex. The following day, Beth rejects O.B. and visits Scott at the football training grounds; she spits on him and is arrested. Beth's obsession with Scott grows and when she sees Izzy Cornwell (Elize du Toit) being physically harassed by Scott, she intervenes. Beth tries scaring Scott and drives towards him, unwittingly knocking him down. Beth is arrested and charged with attempted murder, while Scott is injured and unable to play football professionally. The residents of the village turn against Beth and she is attacked by an inmate while in prison. During Beth's court case, Scott admits to raping Beth and is given a suspended prison sentence for perjury. Beth is sentenced to two months imprisonment for dangerous driving. After being released, Beth struggles to readjust to life and moves to France with Andy and Sue.

It was released on November 7, 2011 on PIAS and Sunday Best. Described as a \\"modern blues\\" album by Lynch, Crazy Clown Time was self- produced and four singles were released. Upon its release, Crazy Clown Time received moderately positive reviews and placed in several international charts, including the U.S. Billboard Heatseekers Albums chart where it peaked at number 3. Composition Crazy Clown Time has been described by Lynch as \\"a collection of dark songs\\" in the style of \\"modern blues\\". The album incorporates elements of avant-garde music, including the use of feedback; noise; dissonance; and soundscapes which feature \\"dense layers of texture\\". Lynch's particular style of blues and his use of avant-garde techniques was commented on by Consequence of Sound, with writer Adam Rier saying that Lynch had \\"taken something very familiar to anyone who has listened to music in the Western world and turned it into something chilling, creepy [and] utterly Lynch-ian.\\" Several tracks on Crazy Clown Time, including \\"Good Day Today\\", are regarded as electronic pop. Lynch's \\"Fifties-style\\" guitar sound on Crazy Clown Time often features use of tremolo, and other effects are used throughout the album, including considerable use of reverb and delay. Lynch's vocal tracks are heavily processed, through use of vocoders and modulation effects. Crazy Clown Times lyrics have been described as \\"enigmatic\\" and some are written in a stream-of-consciousness style. \\"Strange and Unproductive Thinking\\", which includes themes from \\"cosmic awareness to tooth decay\\", features lyrics centered around and referencing Transcendental Meditation, a technique Lynch uses and is an advocate of. Two songs on the album (\\"Strange and Unproductive Thinking\\" and \\"Crazy Clown Time\\") are delivered in a spoken- word vocal style. Lynch and engineer Dean Hurley composed all of the album's songs; Lynch wrote all of the song's lyrics. Lynch and Hurley's songwriting process began as jams, around which songs \\"eventually found a form\\" and to which Lynch later penned the lyrics. Packaging Crazy Clown Times sleeve artwork and booklet were designed by graphic artists Chris Bigg and Vaughan Oliver of v23 under direction from Lynch; Lynch designed several pieces of additional artwork. The \\"Super-Deluxe\\" edition, released in 2012, is packaged in a red-leatherette book \\"and a rigid black suedelle slipcase for maximum tactile effect\\". Describing the process of designing the packaging, Oliver said: The album's title has been theorized by Noisey creative director Eddy Moretti as being related to the \\"Suffocating Rubber Clown Suit of Negativity\\", a concept for personal anger and fear featured in Lynch's 2006 book Catching the Big Fish: Meditation, Consciousness, and Creativity. Release Crazy Clown Time was released worldwide on November 7, 2011. It was released on PIAS America in the U.S. and Sunday Best in Europe and made available on CD, double LP and as a digital download. Special editions of the album were released internationally, including a collector's edition CD in Europe with a 16-page booklet; a CD in Japan with the bonus track \\"I Have a Radio\\"; and an iTunes release with the bonus track \\"Sparkle Lounge Blues\\". A limited-edition \\"Super- Deluxe\\" box set, including a double LP and single CD with artwork by David Lynch and a 24-page book of lyrics, was released in January 2012, followed by a digital-only deluxe edition on August 6 that included several remixes of the album's songs by Skream, Moby, Underworld, Sasha, Trentem√∏ller and Visionquest. Four singles from Crazy Crown Time were released. A double A-side single, \\"Good Day Today\\"/\\"I Know\\", was released in November 2010 to critical acclaim in the U.S. and the UK. and \\"Speed Roadster\\" was made available for Lynch's official website in 2011. \\"Noah's Ark\\", a single-track 12-inch single featuring a remix of the song by Moby was released in April 2012; \\"Pinky's Dream\\" was released in August and featured two remixes by Trentem√∏ller and Visionquest, as well as a previously unreleased remix of \\"Stone's Gone Up\\" by Thyte. Reception At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 62, based on 32 reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". AllMusic reviewer Heather Phares wrote that the album wasn't as \\"accessible\\" as Lynch's previous collaborations but is \\"another example of his ability to put his unmistakable stamp on every art form he attempts\\"; Phares selected \\"Pinky's Dream\\", \\"Good Day Today\\" and \\"Strange and Unproductive Thinking\\" as the album's highlights and rated it three-and-a-half-out-of-five stars. Writing for the A.V. Club, critic Matt Wild said Crazy Clown Time \\"asks an awful lot of fans ‚Ä¶ namely, to accept Lynch as a singer\\" but praised the \\"jaw-dropping [opening track]\\" and concluded that the album \\"fits in nicely with Lynch's untidy and constantly evolving body of work.\\" A four-out-of-five-star review in Billboard said that \\"Good Day Today\\" \\"hits a direct sweet spot\\" and likened the album's \\"3-D sonic wash\\" to \\"wide-open desert landscapes\\" and \\"the kind of barely hinged\\" characters in Lynch's films, but criticized the \\"dense layers of texture and avant ambience\\" and how the album \\"[spends] a lot more time with noir, impressionistic pieces.\\" Clash writer Anna Wilson referred to Crazy Clown Time as \\"a masterful accomplishment\\" and \\"beautifully beguiling\\" and said its production was \\"as meticulous as the sound design in [Lynch's] movies\\", rating it eight out of ten. Rating the album a C+ in Consequence of Sound, critic Adam Kivel commented that \\"[al]though it won't make you think that he's a musician first and a filmmaker second\\" that Crazy Clown Times \\"expressive, emotive features ‚Ä¶ create a real response in the listener, from familiarity to icy discomfort.\\" Filter awarded the album an 80%/100% rating, with writer Kurt Orzeck saying that \\"when [Lynch] decides to sing, you should listen.\\" However, Orzeck also said that the album \\"comes across as Lynch trying to measure up to [Angelo Badalamenti], but falling short.\\" Offering a largely negative review in Paste, critic Ryan Reed wrote that \\"Lynch too often flounders around in moody, broody texture‚Äîmost of which feels lacking without a visual counterpart\\" but praised the \\"quartet of wonderful tracks\\" that open the album; Reed considered the album \\"disappointing\\" and \\"a giant mess\\", rating it five out of ten. Pitchfork contributor Mike Powell wrote a similar review, saying that \\"in light of his filmography, the album feels familiar to the point of redundancy\\" and PopMatters reviewer Philip Majorins surmised that \\"Crazy Clown Time is clouded with studio experiments that attempt to hold up weak songs.\\" Though praising the album's atmosphere and opening track in Rolling Stone, critic Nick Catucci awarded Crazy Clown Time a two-out-of-five- star rating and referred to it as \\"numbing\\". However, Vice listed Crazy Clown Time as the \\"Best Album of the Month\\" and summarized it as \\"an utter fucking treat.\\" Track listing Personnel All personnel credits adapted from Crazy Clown Times album notes. ;Performers *David Lynch ‚Äì vocals , guitar , synthesizer , percussion , omnichord *Dean Hurley ‚Äì guitar , bass , drums , synthesizer , organ , programming *Karen O ‚Äì vocals ;Technical personnel *David Lynch ‚Äì production, mixing *Dean Hurley ‚Äì mixing *Brian Lucey ‚Äì mastering ;Design personnel *David Lynch ‚Äì art direction, artwork *Chris Bigg ‚Äì design *Vaughan Oliver ‚Äì design Charts { class=\\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:left\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" Chart (2011) ! scope=\\"col\\" Peak position - ! scope=\\"row\\" Belgian Albums (Ultratop Flanders)  style=\\"text- align:center\\" 68 - ! scope=\\"row\\" Belgian Heatseekers Albums (Ultratop Wallonia)  style=\\"text-align:center\\" 5 - ! scope=\\"row\\" French Albums (SNEP)  style=\\"text-align:center\\" 96 - ! scope=\\"row\\" Swiss Albums (Hitparade)  style=\\"text-align:center\\" 96 - ! scope=\\"row\\" UK Albums (OCC)  style=\\"text-align:center\\" 91 - ! scope=\\"row\\" UK Independent Albums (OCC)  style=\\"text-align:center\\" 12 - ! scope=\\"row\\" U.S. Heatseekers Albums (Billboard)  style=\\"text-align:center\\" 3 - ! scope=\\"row\\" U.S. Independent Albums (Billboard)  style=\\"text-align:center\\" 50 } References External links 2011 albums Albums produced by David Lynch David Lynch albums PIAS Recordings albums Sunday Best (music company) albums ","title":"Crazy Clown Time"},{"id":"32756975","text":"Red Carpet to walk Odessa International Film Festival 2011 John Malkovich on the Odessa film festival 2011 The second Odessa International Film Festival () took place in Odessa (Ukraine) from 15 to 23 July 2011.Odessa film festival underway, \\"Euronews\\" July 19, 2011 71 films were screened at the festival, and the total number of audience members was tallied at over 70 thousand.Second edition of Odessa IFF builds bridges to Europe, \\"FilmNewEurope.com\\" July 25, 2011 Over 5 thousand guests were accredited at the festival along with over 450 journalists and other members of the press from Ukraine, Russia, Germany, the United States, Romania, Italy and other countries.

The cemetery's original grounds were purchased by the Fells Point Hebrew Friendship Congregation in 1849. In the years since then, the cemetery has expanded until it now stretches from Baltimore Street (south) to Pulaski Highway (north). Chesapeake Uniform Rental, Inc. operates a commercial laundry service plant, under the trade name of Lord Baltimore Uniform, at 3710 E. Baltimore Street. The plant originally opened in 1946 as Lord Baltimore Laundry, Inc. It became part of Chesapeake Uniform in 1999. =Esskay Meats= Esskay's main meatpacking plant was located in the Baltimore Highlands neighborhood at 3800 E. Baltimore Street until 1993. When the plant was completed in 1920, the company incorporated and began operating as Schluderberg-Kurdle Co., Inc., the result of a merger that year between Schluderberg Meatpacking Company and a meatpacking business owned by Thomas J. Kurdle. Esskay was a trade name for the company's products. Its corporation name was amended to Esskay, Inc. on January 17, 1989. After it was purchased in 1985 by Smithfield Foods, Inc., Esskay continued operating as a subsidiary of Smithfield. Its Baltimore plant was closed in 1993, because its structure was not strong enough to support the 10-ton ham-boiling machines the company was planning add to its operations. Its departure from Baltimore also involved a dispute over the continued payment of retiree health benefits.  References   External links  * Southeast District Maps.

The operation resulted in dozens killed and wounded. Latakia, however, has remained quiet throughout the conflict in Syria. Background The Palestinian camp in the al-Ramel area of Latakia had been a site of protest activity since March 2011. The Syrian government claimed 12 were killed there in clashes in late March, leading to the deployment of the military to restrict movement into and out of the city and the government announcing a string of reforms to appease the protesters. The Los Angeles Times claimed that hundreds of Syrians were allegedly arrested, and by late July, activists in Latakia were telling foreign media they feared a more violent crackdown was coming. Protests continued despite the increased security presence and arrests. Several civilians were allegedly killed in confrontations with security officers during this early period of the siege. Escalation More than 20 tanks and APCs rolled into Latakia on 13 August, according to the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR). It reported that activists said at least two civilians were killed in operations on 13 August. On 14 August, the opposition Local Co-ordination Committees (LCC) claimed the death toll increased dramatically as the Syrian Army commenced an artillery and tank bombardment of outskirts of Latakia and the Syrian Navy fired on neighborhoods near the coast with gunboats armed with heavy machine guns. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said it had the names of 26 confirmed dead near Latakia, while SOHR said most of the deaths were caused by machine- gunning. The Syrian government said two security officers and four armed men who were terrorizing residents were killed. The assault reportedly continued on 15 August, when the Syrian Army ordered residents in southern and southeastern Latakia to evacuate. Al Jazeera reported residents claimed soldiers were arresting Palestinians in central Latakia, transporting them with buses, and corralling them inside Al-Assad Stadium. The Syrian Revolution Co-ordinating Union, a coalition of opposition activists, said at least six were killed throughout the day in the camp near Latakia. The Syrian government denied it was directing gunboats against Latakia, calling the claims absolutely baseless, and said the ships off the coast of Latakia were part of an anti-smuggling patrol. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) said more than 5,000 Palestinians had been forced to flee from a refugee camp on the outskirts of Latakia during the assault, and the LCC reported soldiers were moving from residence to residence in the camp and ordering the Palestinians to leave. The LCC also said random gunfire erupted in the area. At least one resident reported the district containing the Palestinian camp was shelled, among others, and that heavy machine-gun fire was being directed at over half a dozen other neighborhoods in the city. Avaaz, the international human rights group, said it could name nine confirmed killed on 16 August in Latakia. Residents reported that many people were being detained as they attempted to flee the city. They also said shabiha, plainclothes militiamen, were looting homes and shops in the al-Ramel neighbourhood, where the Palestinian refugee camp is located, as well as attempting to remove any sign of shooting. One resident said he was afraid the neighbourhood would be completely destroyed. A Los Angeles Times source, claiming to be a doctor in Latakia reported on 18 August that the claims of opposition activists, including the use of warships to attack the city and the detention of hundreds of civilians in a sports stadium, were true. He claimed more than 50 people had died since 14 August in Latakia. Sunni and Palestinian residents of the city were targeted disproportionately, according to his account, and homes were being destroyed by shelling, gunfire, and bulldozers to flush people out into the open where many were rounded up and arrested. On 10 January 2012, video footage appeared to show a small crowd of pro-Government demonstrators in Latakia surrounding and climbing onto the white vehicles used by Arab League monitors, injuring 11 observers.

Biography Doremus was the son of philanthropist Sarah Platt Doremus and her merchant husband Thomas. He studied at Columbia, and graduated from New York University in 1842. Here he came under the influence of John W. Draper, and in 1843 became his assistant in the medical department of the University. This office he held for seven years, and aided Draper in many of his famous researches on light and heat. In 1847 Doremus went to Europe, continuing his chemical studies in Paris with special reference to electrometallurgy, also visiting the establishments where chemical products were manufactured. On his return to New York, in 1848, he established with Charles T. Harris a laboratory on Broadway for the purpose of giving instruction in analytical chemistry, and for making commercial analyses. He was elected professor of chemistry in the New York College of Pharmacy in 1849, and delivered the first lectures in his own laboratory. Meanwhile, he studied medicine with Abraham S. Cox, and received his degree from the medical department of the University in 1850. He was one of the founders of the New York Medical College in 1850, and at his own expense arranged and equipped the first laboratory in the United States for instructing medical students in analytical chemistry, requiring all the candidates for graduation to pass this examination. In 1851 he was elected professor of natural history in the Free Academy of the City of New York (later renamed the City College of New York) where he remained as a professor until 1902. In 1859 he was associated with others in establishing the Long Island College Hospital, where he lectured for several years. He was appointed professor of chemistry and toxicology in Bellevue Hospital Medical College, New York, in 1861. A year later he went to Paris, where he spent two years in developing the use of compressed granulated gunpowder in firearms. The cartridges patented by him require no serge envelopes as are ordinarily used in muzzle loading cannon, and hence no sponging of the gun after firing is necessary. Doremus was authorized by the French minister of war to modify the machinery in the Bouchet pouderie so that gunpowder of the American character could be produced. Subsequently, an exhibition of the firing of compressed granulated powder in cannon and small arms was made in Vincennes, before Napoleon III and many of his generals. This system was adopted by the French government, and a large portion of the Mont Cenis Tunnel was blasted with \\"la poudre comprim√©e.\\" Robert Ogden Doremus While in Paris, he was invited to fill the chair of chemistry and physics in the College of the City of New York. His lectures on toxicology at Bellevue Hospital Medical College resulted in his being called upon by coroners and district attorneys to examine poison cases, and he introduced radical changes in the system of medical jurisprudence. He established a special toxicological laboratory, with a dissecting room attached, kept under lock and key, using only reagents of known purity, and purchasing new glass and porcelain vessels for each case. Doremus further insisted that the expert should have ample time for his researches, and that he should be properly remunerated for his services. His course led to more thorough scientific investigation than was formerly common in poison examinations. In the case of James Stephens, convicted of poisoning his wife, Doremus analyzed not only the entire body of Mrs. Stephens, but another human body, to test the question of \\"normal arsenic.\\" He was the expert in the celebrated Burdell murder case (1857), and examined the blood-stains found in Dr. Burdell's room. In another case he proved the presence of strychnine in a body that had been buried for four months. In 1865 the \\"Atlanta\\" arrived at quarantine, and during her voyage from Liverpool sixty of her passengers had died from cholera. A quick method of disinfection was necessary, and Doremus recommended that chlorine in enormous quantities be used. Under his direction, specially prepared vessels for the generation of this powerful gas were introduced between decks, the hatches battened down, and the vapor allowed to accomplish its work of destroying germs. This treatment proved thoroughly successful, and in 1875 the process was again used, with equal success, in the disinfection of hospital wards. In 1871 he was appointed president of a Board for examining the druggists and their clerks in New York city, which in six months examined over 900 persons. He obtained aid from the Board of Health in suppressing the gases emanating from the gas houses, and opposed its action in adopting the \\"lactometer with the senses\\" as the sole means of testing the purity of milk. Doremus was known as a brilliant lecturer on scientific topics, and frequently appeared before New York audiences in that capacity. He has patented methods for extinguishing fires, and also other chemical processes, also introducing into the United States several chemical industries. The New York university has conferred on him the degree of LL.D. Doremus held for several years the presidency of the New York Philharmonic Society, and has also been president of the New York Medico-Legal Society, of which organization he was chemist for several years. His published writings include only a few addresses, notably that at the unveiling of the Humboldt statue in Central Park, and papers delivered before scientific societies. Family Robert Ogden Doremus married Estelle Skidmore Doremus on October 1, 1850. When Robert's work took the family to Paris, his wife Estelle was remembered as \\"the leader of the American colony in Paris during the most brilliant part of the reign of Napoleon III\\" in the early 1860s. Estelle and Robert Doremus had four children. * Dr. Charles Avery Doremus, was engaged in the general practice of chemistry. For twenty-two years he served as a faculty member of the College of the City of New York. He died December 2, 1925 of heart disease. * Thomas Cornelius Doremus died of pneumonia on March 25, 1928, at 74 years of age. * Estelle E. Doremus died in August 1937.

Intended for the education of future nonconformist ministers of religion, it was in operation from 1799 to 1833, when it relocated to Byng Place in London and became known as Coward College. It was also known as Wymondley Academy and Wymondley House.  Foundation  In 1799, a philanthropic trust established by William Coward took possession of Wymondley House in Little Wymondley, Hertfordshire. They intended it to be a replacement home for the Daventry Academy, a somewhat peripatetic institution which had last been based in Northampton. It had closed that location in 1798 on receiving a report that John Horsey, whom it had placed in charge there in 1789, was preaching Socinianism. The Coward Trust spent ¬£4,258 on purchase and renovation of the Wymondley building, enlarging it to accommodate two tutors and 24 students in their pursuit of studies for dissenting ministry. The trust also determined that the school should be known as Wymondley House, although in practice even in its own day it was more commonly referred to as Wymondley College or Wymondley Academy.  Staff  Overall management of the college was the responsibility of four trustees. William Parry was appointed as theological tutor at the new site, a post that gave to its holder and his wife the responsibility for domestic management. Parry, who had been educated at the Homerton dissenting academy, had the support of the King's Head Society and it was hoped that he would prevent the influence of heresy. At first, Parry was assisted in the teaching of classics and mathematics by William Ward, a former student at Homerton who had become minister at Uppingham. Ward resigned in 1804 after a disagreement with Parry. He was replaced by one of Parry's own former students, William Brown, who left in 1807 when students complained about him. Two more short-lived holders of the assistant's post followed, with Henry Forster Burder, who had been educated at Hoxton College, and Alexander Bower both staying a year. Homerton-educated John Bailey was appointed in December 1809 and his death in 1818 led to the brief tenure of William Day, a former student of Wymondley whom Parry then found to have been depraved in his conduct. Parry died in January 1819, not long after reporting Day to the trustees. Parry's leadership had been characterised by a lack of discipline within the college but this did not improve much with the arrival his replacement, John Atkinson, who had previously been headmaster at Mill Hill School and a tutor of classics at Hoxton College. Some students were expelled and others moved to Manchester College, York as, not for the first time, accusations of doctrinal differences emerged. In February 1821, the trustees told Atkinson that he was unsuitable for the post, an event that may have caused him to die soon after following a paralytic seizure. His successor was briefly the former Hoxton student Joseph Turnbull and then Thomas Morell, who held the post until the closure of the college in 1833. Morell, who had been an Independent minister at St Neots in Huntingdonshire, was assisted until September 1822 by Turnbull, whom the trustees then deemed to be unsuitable. Turnbull's replacement as assistant was Robert Lee of Cambridge, who tenure was ended two years later following what was described as a \\"moment of weakness\\" involving a female servant while his wife was away. Historian Simon Dixon notes that \\"Expulsions, resignations, and defections to the Church of England occurred throughout the Wymondley period, with significant breakdowns in discipline occurring in 1812, 1816, 1820, and 1833\\" but that the Morell era was generally less fractious than the years preceding him. This may have been at least in part because Morell made it a condition of his own appointment that the college, although reluctant, introduced a probationary period for new students, whereas previously there had been no screening at all. The reputation of the college, which at one point had been so bad due to allegations of heterodoxy that local churches hesitated to accept the services of its students, and whose student roll had been as low as four in 1821, was restored. There were 19 enrolled students in 1826. Aside from the full-time academic staff, there were also occasional visiting lecturers. For example, William Trew, who had taught elocution elsewhere, gave classes in 1805 and 1822, John Jackson gave lessons on natural philosophy for some time after the arrival of Morell, and Charles Frederick Partington did the same between 1827 and 1829. There had been an approach from the Bristol Theological Institution in 1819, suggesting that the academy should move to Bristol, but the proposal was dismissed. The first evidence of a serious intent to move location is documented in December 1831, when the trustees thought a shift to London would open opportunities to access teaching at the University of London, which had recently opened. Suitable premises were soon found, the site at Wymondley was closed and sold, and in 1833 the college moved to Byng Place, London, where it was known as Coward College. Morell, who had initially been skeptical of moving, became theological tutor at the new institution. Turnbull's successor as assistant, William Hull, had been told that his services would not be required there because Morell could cope alone if students also had access to the university, and thus in 1832 he left to become a minister in Enfield. Classics tutoring for the brief period thereafter was done by Richard Cotterell Evans.  Curriculum  College students were enrolled on five-year courses and lived on the premises. The costs of boarding and tuition were mostly met by the Coward Trust but, since Coward's will excluded giving regular grants to those aged over 22, the Jackson Trust often provided support for older students. The theology course was much influenced by the lectures of Philip Doddridge and the students benefitted from the library that he had started and which had been expanded into a well-respected collection as the college had moved around its various previous locations in Daventry, Hoxton and Northampton. They were also taught a range of obviously relevant subjects, including ethics, pneumatology, scriptural chronology and theology. Other subjects included algebra, geography, geometry, logic and natural philosophy, as well as the Greek, Hebrew and Latin languages, and Jewish antiquities. In addition to these subjects, the last of which was based on the work of Caleb Ashworth, Morell introduced courses on general history and the history of philosophy and science, as well as lectures on belles lettres.  After closure  Following the closure of the college, Wymondley House became a boys' boarding school and later had numerous other uses. The structure was listed Grade II* in 1968.

The Commission's members were Charles H. Keep, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury and Chairman of the Commission, James R. Garfield, Gifford Pinchot, Frank H. Hitchcock and Lawrence O. Murray. The Commission represented the first assertion by a President that the President is responsible for administration. Establishment of the Committee The Commission was generally charged with improving the administration of government services by investigating the administrative best practices of the day. Specifically, it was charged with examining salary classifications, purchasing procedures, accounting procedures, cost accounting, and generally more uniform and efficient business methods. The need for the Commission was documented in Roosevelt's autobiography when he heard the story of an officer who was in charge of a Bureau of Indian Affairs district office: \\"The story reached him concerning a requisition in 1904 by an officer in charge of a Bureau of Indian Affairs' district office for a stove costing seven dollars. Submitting it in early autumn, the official certified that the stove was vitally needed to keep the infirmary warm during the winter months and that the old stove was worn out and useless. The papers were processed through all their travels in the usual routine, and the stove was authorized and sent out. When the stove reached the district office he acknowledged its receipt according to the proper procedure. 'The stove is here,' he wrote, 'and so is spring.'\\" Ultimately, the Commission formed 12 subcommittees which were composed of about 70 functional experts employed by the government. The Commission also investigated scandals in the Government Printing Office and the Department of Agriculture. Its primary work, though, was administrative process improvement. Notable recommendation * Personnel system improvement, including salary reclassification, efficiency ratings, retirement system for federal employees, uniform regulation for time and leave practices * Purchasing and contracting procedure modification * Coordination of statistics * Records management, including the idea of a \\"National Archival House\\" * Accounting system improvement, including double book entry accounting in the Department of the Treasury which became the first instance of the accounting method in the U.S. government, the use of adding machines, consolidated accounting statements (prior accounts had been kept according to appropriations), official bond standardization, streamlined checks and voucher procedures * Standardized governmental transportation procedures * Inter-departmental relations and work duplication minimization Reactions to the Commission Since none of the members of the Keep Commission were even Presidential Cabinet Members, it seems that some of the Cabinet members were quite embarrassed by the results but others such as the Department of the Interior and the Department of Commerce took the recommendations of the Commission seriously and even encouraged more investigation. The President's direct involvement and support of the Commission seems to have kept dissension to the report to a minimum from the cabinet. However, since the Commission was not sanctioned by Congress, the Cabinet members were free to ignore some recommendations. Congress was suspicious and threatened by the work of the Commission because they saw it as an attempt to consolidate presidential power. They were so threatened, in fact, that they refused to allow the reports of the Commission and its subcommittees to be officially published and it passed an amendment to the Sundry Civil Expenses Appropriation Bill that forbade future expenditures by any committee or commission that had not been authorized by Congress. Presidents continue to deny that Congress has the authority to direct administration in this way. The public perception of the Commission was that it was primarily engaged in an investigation into graft and corruption in government. President Roosevelt, however, maintained that the Commission \\"thoroughly overhauled\\" the business of government. When it appropriated funds to President William Howard Taft, Congress implicitly accepted the view stated by Roosevelt and the Keep Commission that administration was an executive responsibility.

The event now draws tens of thousands of participants annually. The first known origins of the Twelves Pubs of Christmas dates back to 1991 when Gary Lavin and Paul Sheehan, proprietor of Sheehan‚Äôs Bar, Chatham Street, Dublin, Ireland introduced the first crawl with about 7 friends includIng David Wall, Michael McGill, Cormac Kissane, Robert Kennedy, Paul Kilmurray Victor Costello and Ozzy Conboy. This then became an annual event and over the following years was attended by a number of the Irish rugby team (Brian O'Driscol of note) and Ken Doherty the world snooker champion. The event was subsequently documented by Dermot Hayes of the Evening Herald who attended the event one year and who chronicled the crawl in the Evening Herald. From then on there became many copycat events all over Ireland and then the ‚ÄúTwelve Pubs of Christmas‚Äù spread internationally. Rules The original rules of the twelve pubs were 1 you must select a drink you will drink for all of the pubs, this cannot be changed. 2. You have 15 minutes in every pub to finish your drink unless otherwise specified by a nominated person. 2a. Each bar gets a nominated person. This person can nominate the ‚Äòskull‚Äô anytime before the 15 minutes is over. You must then finish your drink within 60 seconds of the nomination. (Be careful here, it‚Äôs a marathon no a sprint) 3 you could not eat on the crawl... eating is cheating! (Penalty ensues) 4 you cannot talk to any member of the opposite sex on the crawl (penalty ensues). Even if she was serving behind the bar (notes usually suffice here) 5. No throwing up (penalty ensues) The penalty for breaking any of the rules was an additional Stinger had to be drunk in the next pub.

This article describes and demonstrates some of these features. Note that one of Racket's main design goals is to accommodate creating new languages, both domain-specific languages and completely new languages. Therefore, some of the following examples are in different languages, but they are all implemented in Racket. Please refer to the main article for more information. The core Racket implementation is highly flexible. Even without using dialects, it can function as a full-featured scripting language, capable of running both with and without windows-native GUI, and capable of tasks from web server creation to graphics.  Runtime Support  = Garbage Collection, Tail Calls, and Space Safety = Racket can use three different garbage collectors: * Originally, the conservative Boehm garbage collector was used. However, conservative collection is impractical for long-running processes such as a web server‚Äîsuch processes tend to slowly leak memory. In addition, there are pathological cases where a conservative collector leaks memory fast enough to make certain programs impossible to run. For example, when traversing an infinite list, a single conservative mistake of retaining a pointer leads to keeping the complete list in memory, quickly overflowing available memory. This collector is often referred to as \\"CGC\\" in the Racket community. * SenoraGC is an alternative conservative garbage collector that is intended mainly for debugging and memory tracing. * The moving memory manager (aka \\"3m\\") is a precise garbage collector, and it has been Racket's default collector since 2007. This collector is a generational one, and it supports memory accounting via custodians (see below). The collector is implemented as a C source transformer that is itself written in Racket. Therefore, the build process uses the conservative collector for bootstrapping. Like all implementations in the Scheme family, Racket implements full tail call elimination. Racket takes this further: the language is made fully safe-for- space, via live variable analysis. This complements the precise garbage collector and in some cases, like in the implementation of Lazy Racket, the two features are crucial for proper execution. This is in addition to additional compiler optimizations such as lambda lifting and just-in-time compilation. = System Interface and Scripting = Racket's system interface includes asynchronous non-blocking I/O, green threads, synchronization channels, semaphores, sub-processes, and TCP sockets. The following program starts an \\"echo server\\" on port 12345. #lang racket (define listener (tcp- listen 12345)) (let echo-server () ;; create a TCP server (define-values (in out) (tcp-accept listener)) ;; handle an incoming connection in a (green) thread (thread (Œª () (copy-port in out) (close-output-port out))) ;; and immediately loop back to accept additional clients (echo-server)) The combination of dynamic compilation and a rich system interface makes Racket a capable scripting language, similar to Perl or Python. The following example demonstrates walking a directory tree, starting at the current directory. It uses the \`in-directory\` function to construct a sequence that walks the tree. The \`for\` form binds \`path\` to each path in the sequence, and \`regexp-match?\` tests these paths against the given regexp pattern. #lang racket ;; Finds Racket sources in all subdirs (for ([path (in-directory)]) ; iterate over the current tree (when (regexp-match? #rx\\"[.]rkt$\\" path) (printf \\"source file: ~a \\" path))) The next example uses a hash table to record previously seen lines and print only unique ones. #lang racket ;; Report each unique line from stdin (let ([saw (make-hash)]) (for ([line (in-lines)]) (unless (hash-ref saw line #f) (displayln line)) (hash-set! saw line #t))) Both of these programs can be run in DrRacket, or on the command line, via the \`racket\` executable. Racket ignores an initial shebang line, making it possible to turn such programs to executable scripts. The following script demonstrates this, in addition to using Racket's library for command-line argument parsing: #!/usr/bin/env racket #lang racket (command-line #:args (base-dir ext re) (for ([p (in-directory)] #:when (regexp-match? (string-append \\"[.]\\" ext \\"$\\") p) [(line num) (in-indexed (file->lines p))]) (when (regexp-match? (pregexp re) line) (printf \\"~a:~a: ~a~n\\" p num line)))) The script is a grep-like utility, expecting three command-line arguments: a base directory, a filename extension, and a (perl-compatible) regular expression. It scans the base directory for files with the given suffix, and print lines matching the regexp pattern. = Resource Management and Sandboxing = Racket features the concept of a \\"custodian\\": a kind of value that acts as a resource manager. This is often used in network servers, where each connection is dealt with in a new custodian, making it easy to \\"clean-up\\" all resources that might have been left open by the handler (e.g., open ports). The following extends the \\"echo server\\" example with such a custodian use: #lang racket (define listener (tcp-listen 12345)) ;; per-connection handler (define (handler in out) (copy-port in out) (close-output-port out)) (let echo-server () (define- values (in out) (tcp-accept listener)) (thread (Œª () (let ([c (make- custodian)]) (parameterize ([current-custodian c]) (handler in out) (custodian-shutdown-all c))))) (echo-server)) Custodians, combined with the memory accounting feature of the 3m garbage collector, and a number of additional runtime parameters that control additional aspects of the runtime, make it possible to create completely safe sandboxed execution contexts. The \`racket/sandbox\` library provides this kind of functionality in a simple way. The following example creates a \\"REPL server\\" on the specified port; connecting to this port will look like a plain Racket REPL, except that the evaluation is subject to the various protection aspects of the sandbox. For example, it is not possible to access the filesystem from this REPL, create network connection, run subprocesses, or use too much time or memory. (In fact, this REPL is safe enough to be given out publicly.) #lang racket (require racket/sandbox) (define e (make-evaluator 'racket/base)) (let-values ([(i o) (tcp-accept (tcp-listen 9999))]) (parameterize ([current-input-port i] [current-output-port o] [current-error-port o] [current-eval e] [current-read- interaction (Œª (x in) (read in))]) (read-eval-print-loop) (fprintf o \\" Bye... \\") (close-output-port o)))  Web and Network Programming  The next example implements a web server using the \`web-server/insta\` language. Each time a connection is made to the server, the \`start\` function is called to get the HTML to send back to the client. #lang web-server/insta ;; A tiny \\"hello world\\" web server (define (start request) (response/xexpr '(html (body \\"Hello World\\")))) Racket also includes the functions you would need to write scrapers and robots. As an example, the following function would list the Google results for a search string. #lang racket ;; Simple web scraper (require net/url net/uri-codec) (define (let-me-google-that-for-you str) (let* ([g \\"http://www.google.com/search?q=\\"] [u (string-append g (uri-encode str))] [rx #rx\\"(?<= ### ).*?(?= )\\"]) (regexp-match* rx (get-pure-port (string->url u))))) The library also includes support for protocols other than http: #lang racket ;; Sending a timed email alert from racket (require net/sendmail) (sleep (* (- (* 60 4) 15) 60)) ; wait 3h 45m (send-mail-message (getenv \\"EMAIL\\") \\"Parking meter alert!\\" (list (getenv \\"EMAIL\\")) null null '(\\"Time to go out and move your car.\\"))  Graphics  Graphic capabilities come in several different flavors that are intended for different audiences. The \`2htdp/image\` library provides convenient functions for constructing images. This library is mainly used by students in HtDP-based courses. In the following example, a \`sierpinski\` function is defined and called (at the same time) to generate a Sierpinski triangle of depth 8. #lang racket ;; A picture (require 2htdp/image) (let sierpinski ([n 8]) (if (zero? n) (triangle 2 'solid 'red) (let ([t (sierpinski (- n 1))]) (freeze (above t (beside t t)))))) DrRacket editors can contain images, and DrRacket displays image values just like any other type of value (such as integers or lists). Running the above program, for example, actually displays a Sierpinski triangle, which can be cut and pasted into another program. The \`plot\` library constructs image values for more mature audiences and needs. For example, the following program plots the sum of two mathbb{R} times mathbb{R} times mathbb{R} rightarrow mathbb{R} (three-dimensional) Gaussians, as concentric, partially transparent surfaces: #lang racket ;; Visualize a sum of two 3D Gaussians as concentric isosurfaces ;; Note: this example requires Racket 5.2 or later (require plot) ;; Returns an R x R x R -> R Gaussian function centered at (cx,cy,cz) (define ((gaussian cx cy cz) x y z) (exp (- (+ (sqr (- x cx)) (sqr (- y cy)) (sqr (- z cz)))))) ;; Lifts + to operate on three-argument functions (define ((f3+ g h) x y z) (+ (g x y z) (h x y z))) ;; Constructs an image value representing the sum of two Gaussians (plot3d (isosurfaces3d (f3+ (gaussian 0 0 0) (gaussian 1.5 -1.5 0)) -1 2.5 -2.5 1 -1 1 #:label \\"g\\")) ; labeling adds a legend Here, the \`isosurfaces3d\` function requires a three-argument function for its first argument, which the curried \`f3+\` supplies. Besides constructing image values, \`plot\` can also write files in PNG, PDF, PostScript and SVG formats. = GUI Programming = Racket implements a portable GUI layer which the libraries mentioned above build on. It is implemented via the native Windows API, via Cocoa on Mac OS X, and via GTK+ on Linux and others. The Racket API is a class-based toolkit, somewhat related to wxWidgets which was used originally. The following simple guessing game demonstrates coding with the GUI toolkit. The \`frame%\` class implements a top-level window, and \`button%\` implements a button. The \`check\` function defined here produces a function that is used for the button's callback action. #lang racket/gui ;; A GUI guessing game (define secret (random 5)) (define f (new frame% [label \\"Guessing game\\"])) ; toplevel window (define t (new message% [parent f] [label \\"Can you guess the number I'm thinking about?\\"])) (define p (new horizontal-pane% [parent f])) ; horizontal container (define ((make-check i) btn evt) (message-box \\".\\" (cond [(< i secret) \\"Too small\\"] [(> i secret) \\"Too big\\"] [else \\"Exactly!\\"])) (when (= i secret) (send f show #f))) ; success => close window (for ([i (in-range 10)]) ; create all buttons (make-object button% (format \\"~a\\" i) p (make-check i))) (send f show #t) ; show the window to start the application The GUI can be hand-coded in this way or with the help of a GUI designer program available on PLaneT.PLaneT: Racket's centralized package distribution system = Slideshow = Slide-based presentations can also be developed in Racket using the \`slideshow\` language, much like Beamer, but with Racket's programmatic facilities. Elements of the slides are pictures that can be combined. For example, the following program displays in full-screen a title slide, followed by a slide with some pictures. The \`vc-append\` and \`hc-append\` functions combine pictures vertically and horizontally, respectively, and centered on the other axis. #lang slideshow (slide (text \\"Slideshow\\" 'roman 56) (text \\"Making presentations in Racket\\" 'roman 40)) (slide #:title \\"Some pictures\\" (apply vc-append (for/list ([i 5]) (define (scale+color p c) (colorize (scale p (/ (add1 i) 5)) c)) (hc-append (scale+color (filled-rectangle 100 50) \\"darkblue\\") (scale+color (disk 100) \\"darkgreen\\") (scale+color (arrow 100 (/ pi 6)) \\"darkred\\") )))) Extension packages also exist on PLaneT, for example to include LaTeX elements.  Foreign Function Interface  Racket features a foreign function interface that is based on libffi. The interface allows writing unsafe low-level C-like code, that can allocate memory, dereference pointers, call out to functions in shared libraries, and send out callbacks to Racket functions (using libffi closures). The core implementation is a thin layer atop libffi (written in C), and the full interface is then implemented via Racket code. The interface uses macros extensively, resulting in an expressive Racket-based interface description language. This language has a number of useful features, such as uniform representation for higher-order functions (avoiding the pitfalls when callbacks and callouts are different), struct definitions that are similar to plain Racket structs, and custom function types that can represent input and output pointers, implicit arguments (e.g., an argument that provides the number of elements in a vector that is passed as another argument). By using this interface to access underlying GUI toolkits, Racket implements its own GUI layer completely in Racket. The FFI can be used in a number of different ways: from writing a complete glue layer for a library (as done for Racket's OpenGL binding), to quickly pulling out a single foreign function. An example of the latter approach: #lang racket/base ;; Simple use of the FFI (require ffi/unsafe) (define mci-send-string (get-ffi-obj \\"mciSendStringA\\" \\"Winmm\\" (_fun _string [_pointer = #f] [_int = 0] [_pointer = #f] -> [ret : _int]))) (mci-send-string \\"play sound.wav wait\\")  Language Extensions  Racket's most notable feature is its ability to build new domain-specific and general-purpose languages. This is the result of combining a number of important features: * a flexible module system that is used for linking code and for namespace management, * an extensive macro system‚Äîfunctioning as a compiler-API‚Äîthat can create new syntactic forms, * a rich runtime system, providing features that language implementors can use, like (composable, delimited) continuations, resource management, etc., * a way to specify (and implement) parsers for new language syntaxes. The module system plays an important role in combining these features, and making it possible to write code that spans across a number of modules, where each can be written in a different language. Such languages are used extensively in the Racket distribution and in user libraries. In fact, creating a new language is so straightforward, that there are some languages that have less than a handful of uses. Racket comes with a number of useful languages, some are very different from Racket's default language. = Scribble = Scribble, Racket's documentation system, comes in the form of a number of languages that are used to write prose. It is used for Racket's documentation, as well as writing books and articles. Actually, rather than a single \\"scribble\\" language, it is a family of (very similar) dialects, each for a different purpose. To run the following example, copy it into DrRacket and click one of the two scribble rendering buttons that will appear (PDF rendering requires pdfTeX). Alternatively, use the \`scribble\` executable on the file. #lang scribble/base @; Generate a PDF or an HTML document using \`scribble' @(require (planet neil/numspell)) @title{99 Bottles of Beer} In case you need some @emph{blah blah} in your life. @(apply itemlist (for/list ([n (in-range 99 0 -1)]) (define N (number->english n)) (define N-- (number->english (sub1 n))) @item{@string-titlecase[N] bottles of beer on the wall, @N bottles of beer. Take one down, pass it around, @N-- bottles of beer on the wall.})) The most striking feature of the Scribble languages is their use of a new syntax, which is designed specifically for textually rich code. The syntax allows free-form text, string interpolation, customizable quotations, and is useful in other applications such as preprocessing text, generating text, and HTML template systems. Note that the syntax extends plain S-expressions, and is implemented as an alternative input for such expressions. #lang scribble/text Hi, I'm a text file -- run me. @(define (thrice . text) @list{@text, @text, @text}) @thrice{SPAM}! @thrice{HAM}! = Typed Racket = Typed Racket is a statically typed variant of Racket. The type system that it implements is unique in that the motivation in developing it was accommodating as much idiomatic Racket code as possible‚Äîas a result, it includes subtypes, unions, and much more. Another goal of Typed Racket is to allow migration of parts of a program into the typed language, so it accommodates calling typed code from untyped code and vice versa, generating dynamic contracts to enforce type invariants. This is considered a desirable feature of an application's lifetime stages, as it matures from \\"a script\\" to \\"an application\\", where static typing helps in maintenance of a large body of code. #lang typed/racket ;; Using higher-order occurrence typing (define-type Str-or-Num (U String Number)) (: tog ((Listof Str-or-Num) -> String)) (define (tog l) (apply string-append (filter string? l))) (tog (list 5 \\"hello \\" 1/2 \\"world\\" (sqrt -1))) = Lazy Racket = The \`lazy\` language is a language with lazy evaluation semantics, similar to Haskell. In the following example, \`fibs\` is an infinite list whose 1000th element will not be computed until its value is needed for the printout. #lang lazy ;; An infinite list: (define fibs (list* 1 1 (map + fibs (cdr fibs)))) ;; Print the 1000th Fibonacci number: (print (list-ref fibs 1000)) = Logic Programming = Racket comes with three logic programming languages: Racklog, a Prolog-like language; a Datalog implementation; and a miniKanren port. Unlike the Scribble syntax, the first two of these languages use a completely new syntax rather than an extension of S-expressions. If you use it in DrRacket, you'll see that it provides proper highlighting, the usual host of tools check syntax, and a Prolog/Datalog REPL. #lang datalog ancestor(A, B) :- parent(A, B). ancestor(A, B) :- parent(A, C), D = C, ancestor(D, B). parent(john, douglas). parent(bob, john). ancestor(A, B)? = Educational Tools = The PLT group which develops Racket has traditionally been involved in education at all levels. One of the earliest research ideas that the group promoted is the use of language levels, which restrict new students while providing them with helpful error messages that fit the student's level of knowledge. This approach is heavily used in How to Design Programs, the textbook that several PLT developers have authored, as well as in the ProgramByDesign project. The following program uses the \`htdp/bsl\`‚Äîthe \\"beginning student language\\". It uses the \`2htdp/image\` library for creating pictures in the teaching languages, and the \`2htdp/universe\` library for interactive animations. #lang htdp/bsl ;; Any key inflates the balloon (require 2htdp/image) (require 2htdp/universe) (define (balloon b) (circle b \\"solid\\" \\"red\\")) (define (blow-up b k) (+ b 5)) (define (deflate b) (max (- b 1) 1)) (big-bang 50 (on-key blow- up) (on-tick deflate) (to-draw balloon 200 200)) = Algol = Racket comes with a complete implementation of the ALGOL 60 language. #lang algol60 begin integer procedure SIGMA(x, i, n); value n; integer x, i, n; begin integer sum; sum := 0; for i := 1 step 1 until n do sum := sum + x; SIGMA := sum; end; integer q; printnln(SIGMA(q*2-1, q, 7)); end =Plai and plai-typed= #lang plai #lang plai-typed Another supported language is plai which like racket can be typed or untyped. \\"Modules written in plai export every definition (unlike scheme).\\" http://docs.racket-lang.org/plai/plai-scheme.html?q=plai \\"The Typed PLAI language differs from traditional Racket most importantly by being statically typed. It also gives you some useful new constructs: define- type, type-case, and test.\\" Krishnamurthi, Shriram. \\"Programming Languages: Application and Interpretation.\\" Programming Languages: Application and Interpretation. Brown University, n.d. Web. 14 Mar. 2016. . = Additional Languages = Finally, the following example is an implementation of a new language: #lang racket (provide (except-out (all-from-out racket) #%top #%app) (rename-out [top #%top] [app #%app])) (define-syntax-rule (top . x) 'x) (define-syntax-rule (app f . xs) (if (hash? f) (hash-ref f . xs) (f . xs))) This language: * provides everything from the \`racket\` language, so it is a somewhat similar variant, * except for two special \\"hook macros\\" that implement unbound variable lookup and function calls, instead of these, new forms are provided to  implicitly quote all unknown variables  allow hash tables to be used as functions, where the arguments are used for hash-table lookup.Note that \`#%app\` is a macro that is used in all function calls, making this language not too efficient, as every function call incurs an additional condition. In addition, the macro evaluates the function expression twice, so it should not be taken as an example of good macro-programming. If this code is stored in a \`mylang.rkt\` file, you can use it as follows: #lang s-exp \\"mylang.rkt\\" ; sexpr syntax, using mylang semantics (define h (make-hasheq)) (hash-set! h A B) ; A and B are self-evaluating here (h A) ; the hash table is used as a function  References  * External links docs.racket Articles with example Racket code Software development Language workbench ","title":"Racket features"},{"id":"32757495","text":"Zdzis≈Çaw () is a Slavic given name which contains two parts: \\"zdzie / zde\\" - to do, make , and \\"s≈Çaw / slav\\" - glory, fame.

It bordered the governorate's Erivansky and Novobayazetsky Uyezds to the north, the Nakhichevansky Uyezd to the south, the Zangezursky and Dzhevanshirsky Uyezds of the Elisabethpol Governorate to the east, and Persia to the southwest. It included most of the Vayots Dzor Province of present-day Armenia and the Sharur District of the Nakhichevan exclave of present-day Azerbaijan. Its administrative center was the village of Bash-Norashen (≈û…ôrur). Geography The geography of the uyezd resembled a crater surrounded from the south, north and east by tall mountain ranges of the Lesser Caucasus. The plain, which made up a small part of the uyezd, was close to the Aras River, into which the only river irrigating the plains, the Arpa-chay, discharged. The mountainous part of the territory was called Daralagyoz and the lowland part was called Sharur. Daralagyoz constituted approximately 70% of the whole uyezd area and Sharur constituted approximately 30%, even though it included about half of the uyezd's population. The Arpa-chay started at the southeastern tip of Lake Sevan (Gokcha) and flowed 107 versts before discharging into the Aras. It had many tributaries, the Alagyoz-chay being the longest. Approximately 12,150 desyatins of the mountainous part of uyezd was forested. The temperature in the winter reached -27 ¬∞C. History The territory of the uyezd was part of Persia's Erivan and Nakhichevan Khanates until 1828, when according to the Treaty of Turkmenchay, they were annexed to the Russian Empire. It was administered as part of the Armenian Oblast from 1828 to 1840. In 1844, the Caucasus Viceroyalty was re-established, in which the territory of the Sharur- Daralagezsky Uyezd formed part of the Tiflis Governorate. In 1849, the Erivan Governorate was established, separate from the Tiflis Governorate. It was made up of the Erivansky, Nakhchivansky, Aleksandropolsky, Novobayazetsky, and Ordubadsky Uyezds. Following administrative reforms, the northern part of the Nakhchivansky Uyezd (Daralagyoz) was separated to form part of the new Sharur- Daralagezsky Uyezd in 1870. In 1918-1920, the uyezd was disputed between the First Republic of Armenia and the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic.Tsutsiev, pp. 71‚Äì76. After the establishment of Soviet rule in 1920, the territory of the uyezd was divided. Daralagyoz became part of the Armenian SSR and Sharur became part of the Nakhichevan ASSR of the Azerbaijan SSR in accordance with the treaties of Moscow and Kars. Demographics According to the 1897 Russian Empire Census, the population of the uyezd was 76,538, of which 51,560 were Tatars (modern Azerbaijanis; 67.4%), 20,726 were Armenians (27.1%), and 3,761 Kurds (4.9%). 1897 Census, Sharur-Daralagezsky Uyezd Demoscope Weekly The largest town in the district was Keshishkend (Yeghegnadzor) in Daralagyoz, which had a total population of 1,307. The administrative center of the district, the village of Bash-Norashen in Sharur, had a total population of 867, of which 597 (68.8%) were Tatars, 132 (15.2%) Armenians, 90 (10.3%) Kurds, and 31 (3.5%) East Slavs (Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarusians). 1897 Census, Bash-Norashen Village Demoscope Weekly Armenians were mostly concentrated in mountainous Daralagyoz, while lowland Sharur was overwhelmingly Tatar. The population in Daralagyoz was engaged primarily in cattlebreeding while the residents of Sharur were engaged in agricultural farming and gardening.

As a comedian and supporting actress, she got her start singing in Hollywood night clubs. Triola made her mark in the well known musical film Lullaby Of Broadway (1951) and received much praise for her effort in the motion picture Without Reservations (1946), which starred Claudette Colbert and John Wayne. She participated in five Hollywood films, assisted with USO tours in the Pacific Theater during World War II, and caused audiences to lose themselves in laughter, but Triola may best be remembered for work as a singer and comedian with the musical theatre that included performances in night clubs all over the country such as the Blue Angel in New York City. Triola was listed as being one of the most popular performers in the history of Music Circus that included her work with the Sacramento Music Circus in the 1950s. She was described as a petite, dark haired, dark-eyed song stylist with the Betty Hutton type of delivery. Early life Triola was born in Los Angeles, California and was of Italian descent. Her childhood was not typical for a little girl growing up in Southern California. Instead, Triola embarked on a long stint of study that began with piano when she was just three years old, prematurely launching her professional career when most children were, back then, mastering the art of roller skating. She learned to play the accordion, and by the early age of 12 Triola began playing the squeezebox and singing in various cafes, including one called \\"Burp Hollow.\\" World War II At Hollandia, Dutch New Guinea, 1944 Left to right: Helen McClure, Shirley Cornell, Judith Anderson, Anne Triola The beginning of Triola's career in show business was interrupted by World War II as Hollywood became involved with the war effort through its USO tours that included big-name actors Bob Hope and Gary Cooper. From the Hollywood \\"Bar of Music\\" she went on a South Pacific tour with Judith Anderson's USO troupe. They served in a number of USO shows during the war and entertained at such well-remembered spots in New Guinea as Lae, Nadzab and Finchhaven in spite of all the dangers that existed from air raids by Japanese bombers and strafing Zeros that were land-based or planes coming from aircraft carriers Shokaku and Zuikaku. It was recorded on a specific day in the summer of 1944 at Hollandia, Dutch New Guinea, that Triola, Anderson, and their USO troupe entertained as many as 1,500 American servicemen‚ÄîNavy, Army, and Merchant Marine personnel‚Äîat the 113th Amphitheater. Triola played her accordion while Shirley Cornell played the violin. Noted actress Anderson and Helen McClure each performed singing duties while PFC Paul Parmalee played the piano as the group worked together to lift the spirits of battle-weary, worn- out soldiers. Triola lost one $1,500 accordion at the Pacific when a light globe set fire to it. Career =Started As Accordionist= The career of Anne Triola was marked by circumstances, and her success as a singing comedian was the result of one of these. Originally Triola was an accordionist and as such accompanied Judith Anderson's USO troupe into the Pacific Theater during World War II. She was well known as a night club performer only. In New Guinea her accordion burned and it became necessary for Triola to reschedule her act. \\"Then,\\" she said, \\"I just started singing a little bit to help out.\\" She found she had success with comedy selections. \\"My friends used to tell me I had a flair for comedy with the accordion, but I never specialized in it until I started singing,\\" she said. =Becomes Singer= When she returned from USO tours she set out to \\"develop a style of my own\\" and once more started a nightclub circuit act, this time as a singer. Possibly her greatest fortune occurred while singing in the Blue Angel in New York City. There she became acquainted with some of the top New York theatrical persons. Rodgers and Hammerstein asked her to star in the London production of Annie Get Your Gun. Her nightclub commitments prevented her from taking the offer but several years later Oscar Hammerstein recommended her for the same role in the Sacramento Music Circus. While singing at Slapsy Maxie's, Director Mervyn LeRoy and Producer Jesse L. Lasky signed her for movies at RKO where she made three movies, one with John Wayne. It was reported that Triola was in the floor show at Slapsy Maxie Rosenbloom's when Lasky and LeRoy found her and immediately offered her a contract. From those movies, Without Reservations stood out where she had a feature role. Journalist Gene Handsaker singled out Triola for this reason in a June 5, 1946, edition of the Prescott Evening Courier as he explained, \\"Some supporting performances are terrific, especially that of Anne Triola, who amid shrieks of preview laughter swiped her scenes clear away from Stars Colbert and John Wayne.\\" She was loaned to Warner Brothers for the comic supporting role opposite Billy De Wolfe in Lullaby Of Broadway (1951). Then the motion picture industry deflated, leaving contracts mostly worthless. Lullaby Of Broadway would be her last movie which was filmed in Technicolor. Triola and De Wolfe sang a couple of duets, \\"You're Dependable\\" and \\"We'd Like to Go on a Trip.\\" Box-office star Doris Day and actor Gene Nelson received most of the attention in the Technicolor musical extravaganza, but the comedy aspect of the film was well provided with the performances of De Wolfe and his vaudeville partner, Triola. =Started in Television= Once more Anne Triola returned to night clubs and started in the new entertainment medium, television. She appeared on panel programs and as guest artist on shows. Her last television program was as a guest of Frank Sinatra. Soon afterward, Triola's career would come to a halt as she would soon marry in 1953, move to nearby Modesto and become a housewife. \\"After the hustle and bustle of show business,\\" she said, \\"it is nice to settle down for a change where it is quiet.\\" =Music Circus= Triola's connection with the Music Circus eventually brought her out of retirement from show business. Actually, she was a part of the Sacramento Music Circus when it first started in 1951 which was vaudeville stage entertainment being held inside a big blue and green tent. Triola starred in this operation during its first two seasons before marrying Ralph J. Quartaroli in 1953. In July 1954, she broke out of retirement and began rehearsing for leading roles in the same Sacramento Music Circus. She assisted such musicals as New Faces, Oklahoma!, and Brigadoon. She played the role of Meg in Brigadoon and sang Eartha Kitt's numbers in New Faces. With Triola's popularity growing, producers Howard Young and Russell Lewis gave a fitting tribute to Music Circus' favorite actress as they opened the fifth anniversary season in May 1955. She starred in the musical Annie Get Your Gun which was her signature gig that Triola had performed during the Music Circus' first season. In August 1959, she took on the lead role of Bells Are Ringing at the Sacramento Music Circus. Co-starring with her were Gar Moore and Marvin Kaplan. She performed the role of a telephone answering service operator in this romantic musical comedy which ran for two weeks straight that summer. Personal life In 1953, Triola married successful businessman Ralph J. Quartaroli, president of Stanislaus Food Products Company, and decided to break away from show business as the couple moved to Modesto, California, where his family owned a cannery. She had met him in Los Angeles when she was there on a business trip. She decided \\"from experience in show business\\" marriages and careers may mix but not well. So Triola abandoned her career and became a housewife. \\"It is hard work, the kind of work a person does for the love of it and not money,\\" she added. A few years later on November 16, 1956, Triola gave birth to a 6-pound, 13-ounce baby girl, whom they named Tina. This gave them two daughters in all as Quartaroli had a daughter named Susan from his previous marriage to his first wife, Edna B. Quartaroli. Tragedy struck the family when Triola's husband and three passengers on board his private airplane were killed in a plane crash during a trip from Las Vegas to Van Nuys, California, on May 15, 1960.

Family  He was the youngest son of Count William Louis of Nassau- Saarbr√ºcken and Anna Amalia of Baden-Durlach, daughter of the Margrave George Frederick of Baden-Durlach.  Military career  Walrad was a respected military leader. At different times, he was General Field Marshal of the Holy Roman Empire of German Nation and of the United Provinces of the Netherlands under Prince William III of Orange. In 1664, he hurried to Szentgotth√°rd, but he came too late to fight in the Battle of Saint Gotthard. In 1683, he fought successfully in the battle to lift the Turkish siege of Vienna. So he had a role in ensuring that the Islamic conquest of Central Europe by the Ottomans failed. For these feats, King John III Sobieski of Poland granted him the Order of the White Eagle, the highest Polish distinction. Walrad also fought in the War of the Palatine Succession. From 1696, he commanded the Dutch troops. On 1 July 1690, he fought in the Battle of Fleurus and on 3 August 1692 the Battle of Steenkerke.

The town gained significantly in prestige and importance by being the seat of a Nassau and also benefited from Walrad's urban construction zeal. Between 1660 and 1663, Walrad replace the old Usingen Castle by a new palace. In 1905, the grateful city council erected a monument for Walrad in the palace gardens (now a public park). In 1692 a fire destroyed large parts of Usingen. Walrad used this circumstance control to the systematic reconstruction of the upper town of Usingen. He designed the symmetrical streets that characterize the cityscape today were and built representative buildings along the high street. The population of the country around Usingen had been decimated in the Thirty Years' War. Walrad promoted the influx of Huguenots who had to flee from France, and granted them freedom of religion. The Huguenot Church in Usingen is evidence of this migration.  Marriage and issue  Walrad's first marriage was with Catherine Fran√ßoise, Comtesse de Cro√ø-Roeulx.

De Loach Jr. (born September 14, 1938, Montgomery, Alabama) is a California grape-grower and winemaker in the Russian River Valley AVA who has contributed to the reputation and notoriety of Sonoma County viticulture. Personal history Prior to his name-making career in viniculture, De Loach was a United States Marine Corps sharpshooter, a race-track photographer at Golden Gate Fields, a private pilot, and received a degree in Anthropology from San Francisco State University. During his childhood he was raised in Macon, GA where he attended Lanier High School, an all-boys military school. His family subsequently moved to San Francisco in 1945. He graduated from Lincoln High School in San Francisco's Sunset District in 1956. Wine career Cecil De Loach (seated on tractor) on the Barbieri Ranch circa 1970 with his two sons John (left) and Michael. De Loach began growing grapes in 1970 when he purchased the 24-acre Barbieri Ranch at 2150 Olivet Road in Santa Rosa, CA for approximately $60,000. The Barbieri Ranch had been planted by Itilo Barbieri in 1905. De Loach purchased the old Zinfandel vineyard from Itilo's son Louis. In 1973 he purchased his second vineyard property, 17 acres located at 1791 Olivet Road, to which he planted Pinot noir, Chardonnay, Zinfandel and Gewurztraminer. The site also comprised approximately five acres of 1940s-era mixed-grape vineyards (mostly Palomino and Golden Chasselas), an orchard of approximately 5 acres (Gravenstein apples, figs, Santa Rosa plums, peaches, French prunes, pears, walnuts), and a small sheep-shearing barn. This site became what is now De Loach Vineyards. These early De Loach plantings combined modern ecologically sound techniques with existing local farming methods including the planting of tilth- and nutrient-producing native cover crops, rotating-row tillage, drip irrigation, micro-frost protection, permanent cover farming, and the integration of beneficial birds, animals and biological components which eventually became known as sustainable farming. De Loach's wife Christine helped draft the first California Code of Sustainable Winegrowing in 1999. De Loach Vineyards was the first farming operation in Sonoma County to be certified as a Fish-Friendly Farm, in 2000. In 1975 De Loach made his first commercial wine, approximately 1000 cases of Zinfandel from the Barbieri Ranch, in a rented industrial space on the west side of Santa Rosa. While selling this wine he sought permits for a permanent winery to be built at his new vineyard on Olivet Road. The first phase of the three-phase construction was completed in 1979. In addition to Zinfandel, that year the winery produced its first Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Gewurztraminer, White-Zinfandel and Pinot noir-blanc. De Loach had been serving as a firefighter and tillerman in the San Francisco Fire Department, which he joined in 1966. He retired from the hook & ladder company Station 10 in 1982 in order to tend to the fledgling De Loach Vineyards brand full-time. The winery grew to produce other varietals including Cabernet Sauvignon, Sauvignon blanc (Fume Blanc), Merlot, Pinot gris, Viognier, and Sangiovese, along with late harvest and reserve wines. In 1996 De Loach added a 250,000 case capacity crush facility at 2120 Olivet Road which was capable of processing in excess of 100 tons of grapes per day. Notable De Loach alumni winemakers include Bob Cabral of Three Sticks and Randy Ullom of Kendall-Jackson Winery. During his tenure as Founder, President and Winemaster at De Loach Vineyards, De Loach served as president of the Sonoma County Vintners Association (aka Sonoma County Wineries Association), the Sonoma County Vintner‚Äôs Coop Warehouse, and the Russian River Wine Road. He created his eponymous De Loach Vineyards brand along with several other labels still in production including Hartman Lane Vineyards and Winery, Sonoma Cuvee, and Hook & Ladder, which was originally a port offering under De Loach's \\"OFS\\" (Our Finest Selection) reserve banner in the 1990s. At its peak De Loach Vineyards produced 250,000 cases, and owned or leased over 1000 planted vineyard acres in the Russian River Valley. Notable single vineyards included Papera Ranch, Pelletti Ranch, Gambogi Ranch, Saitone Ranch and Barbieri Ranch, which were all zinfandel plantings from the late 1800s and early 1900s. Sale of the De Loach Vineyards brand Cecil and Christine De Loach at their eponymous winery in the nineties, a time of rapid growth in the California wine industry. In November 2003 De Loach sold the De Loach Vineyards brand and the original winery site to Boisset Family Estates for $17.5 million just prior to emerging from an 8-month Chapter 11 (protection from creditors) bankruptcy proceeding pending reorganization. Cecil De Loach and his farming company, Sweetwater Land & Cattle Company, retained ownership of the majority of his vineyard holdings. Latest projects In December 2004 De Loach started C & C Wine Company, a custom-crush winery with offices at The Saitone Ranch at 2027 Olivet Road, a zinfandel vineyard which was planted in 1895. In the same month De Loach sold the 250,000 case capacity crush facility at 2120 Olivet Road to Derek Benham of Sonoma Wine Company for $6.2 million. In May 2005, Joe Anderson and Mary Dewane purchased Hartman Lane Vineyards and Winery from Cecil De Loach for $3.6 million. Hartman Lane was De Loach's 18-acre Pinot noir vineyard and winery facility, which the new owners renamed Benovia Winery. Prior to De Loach's ownership the site was originally home to celebrated Pinot noir winemaker Merry Edwards' winery The Merry Vintners. Hook & Ladder Winery continues to produce the Hartman Lane Pinot noir label. Hook & Ladder Winery Hook and Ladder logo Hook & Ladder Winery is a family-owned and operated wine producer located at 2134 Olivet Road (Santa Rosa, CA) in the Russian River Valley of Sonoma County, CA, founded by Cecil De Loach and his wife Christine, in 2005. The winemaker is Cecil De Loach's grandson Jason De Loach, formerly cellar master at Dutton-Goldfield Winery and Balletto Vineyards and Winery. Michael De Loach served as president until October, 2016; prior to Hook & Ladder he was president of De Loach Vineyards. As an estate producer, Hook & Ladder sustainably grows all of its own grapes, makes all of its own wines, and bottles the wine on its premises. The winery sources its grapes from Sweetwater Land & Cattle Co., a grape farming operation owned by Cecil De Loach, which comprises 375 acres of vineyard in Russian River Valley. The winery produces blends from a variety of grapes including Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Sangiovese, Zinfandel, Petite Sirah, Alicante Bouschet and Carignane. The winery also produces a full range of varietal wines including Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Sauvignon blanc, Zinfandel and Gewurztraminer. The total annual case production is approximately 25,000 cases. In addition Hook & Ladder produces an extra virgin olive oil from their Los Amigos Ranch in Healdsburg, CA. Hook & Ladder owns four other wine brands: Hartman Lane Vineyards & Winery, Tuscan Ridge, Sweetwater, and Four Rows.

The agreement was signed in Zagreb, Croatia on 22 November 1998 and followed by a protocol of 11 December 2001 further regulating the issue. The agreement provides for unobstructed transit of vehicles with Croatian license plates and documents traveling from and to Croatian territory, prohibits loading or unloading of goods or passengers and changes of mode of transportation except in cases of traffic accidents or vehicle breakdowns, but it does allow officials of the Bosnia and Herzegovina to prohibit transit of goods whose import is not permitted due to health concerns. The agreement finally provides that it shall be in force as long as Ploƒçe Agreement, regulating use of the Port of Ploƒçe by Bosnia and Herzegovina, is implemented. , the treaty is still not ratified (it was not published in Narodne novine) and there is no actual route permitting the type of transit provided for by the agreement where vehicles would not stop for border controls in the area. However, one lane at the border is designed to declare that the traveler is only transiting between parts of Croatia, and those driving in this lane are usually not stopped for border control. At the time Klek/Neum 1 and Neum 2/Zaton Doli border crossings on the D8 state road are available to international road traffic, along with Vukov Klanac and Imotica border checkpoints which are available for local traffic only.  Border issues if Croatia joins the Schengen Area  Border checks between Neum and both \\"mainland Croatia\\" and the Dubrovnik exclave are currently relatively quick visual checks to confirm that the passport photograph matches the passport holder and that the passport has not expired. However, should Croatia join the Schengen Area in future (which it is bound to do in accordance with the conditions of its accession to the European Union), checks would be considerably more stringent and time-consuming, as the Schengen Borders Code requires passports of all travellers to be electronically scanned against security databases upon both entering and exiting the Schengen area. Thus, someone travelling by road from Dubrovnik to mainland Croatia would undergo three distinct border checks: a Croatian (Schengen) exit check, a Bosnia- Herzegovina entry check, and a Croatian (Schengen) entry check. Both exit and entry checks for the Schengen Area take between 10 and 30 seconds per individual. Thus, as an example, a car containing four people could be stopped for two minutes at each Schengen/Croatian border on both entry and exit. In the busy summer tourist season, this would lead to unsustainable delays on both sides of both border crossings. Partially for this reason, the Pelje≈°ac Bridge is currently under construction, which will connect the two separate parts of Croatia with each other, bypassing Neum and thus avoiding the need for border checks.

Events in the book take place directly after the end of Confessor.  Plot summary  Richard and Kahlan are contentedly enjoying Cara's marriage when a boy named Henrik warns them of dark things to come before scratching them both and running away. Soon after, Cara warns Richard that something or someone was watching her in her room. At first unbelieving, Richard and Kahlan notice the same spooky presence on their own. Shortly after these events, prophecies are given by the most unexpected places and people, but appear equally in a book titled End Notes. After failing to reason with the delegates alarmed by these prophecies, Kahlan and Nicci frighten them into silence with a prediction invented by themselves. Meanwhile, Richard finds a strange machine underground, bearing an emblem exactly as on a wordbook for translating the language of creation, only reversed. It is later revealed that this machine is the source of all the new and strange predictions, and may be an artificial intelligence. Among the delegates is Abbot Dreier, the representative of Bishop Hannis Arc of Saavedra, who becomes the antagonist of this book and its sequels. The scratch on Kahlan's arm worsens, and Zedd fails to heal it. When Kahlan feverishly wakes from a rest, she finds a pack of dogs surrounding her. A fight and chase then ensues until Kahlan runs away in a carriage. When Richard finds out that Kahlan is gone, he traces her footsteps and sends soldiers to find her. She is ultimately captured by a monstrous 'Hedge Maid': a macabre sorceress associated with necromancy. Richard tries to save Kahlan, but is himself captured. Richard remembers the machine's last warning, protects his and Kahlan's ears, and cuts the leather strips on the Hedge Maid's mouth, whereupon she emits a terrible shriek and dies. Richard and Kahlan are found by Nicci and Zedd, who take them to the Garden of Life to heal them.

Everington and was succeeded by ex-Berkeley, California Police Chief August Vollmer, a prominent criminologist. During his short reign as chief, Oaks frequently clashed with Los Angeles City Council member Ralph Luther Criswell. In 1922, Criswell claimed that \\"members of the police department have been levying thousands of dollars in protection money\\".\\"Grand Jury Will Sift Charges on Gambling,\\" Los Angeles Times, August 2, 1922, page II-1\\"Oaks Defends Vice Division,\\" Los Angeles Times, August 4, 1922, page II-9 Subsequently, for several weeks, he blocked Oaks' request for 1,500 badges for his police officers and 50 Dodge automobiles for the L.A.P.D.\\"Criswell Beaten by Chief Oaks,\\" Los Angeles Times, August 18, 1922, page II-9 Upton Sinclair Incident In 1923, Oaks also clashed with Upton Sinclair, a prominent writer and socialist politician, when one of the L.A.P.D.'s Red Squads virtually kidnapped the writer at a rally in San Pedro. The San Pedro rally was held in support of the free speech rights of Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). As Sinclair began to read from the Bill of Rights, he was promptly arrested by officers of the L.A.P.D. The arresting officer proclaimed that \\"we'll have none of that Constitution stuff.\\" Sinclair was arrested despite the fact that his appearance at the rally was already cleared by the office of Los Angeles Mayor George E. Cryer, which had declared it would allow him to exercise his free speech rights as long as he did not make an incitement to violence. Chief Oaks, who claimed that Sinclair was \\"more dangerous than 4,000 I.W.W.\\", had one of his police officers swear out a complaint on which Sinclair was arrested. The complaint charged Sinclair with the offense of \\"discussing, arguing, orating and debating certain thoughts and theories, which... were detrimental and in opposition to the orderly conduct of affairs of business, affecting the rights of private property....\\" Hundreds of other rally attendees also were arrested by the L.A.P.D., but Sinclair was given \\"special\\" treatment as part of a plan by Oaks to silence him, not just at the rally, but for years to come. Oaks had issued a public statement, declaring, \\"I will prosecute Sinclair with all the vigor at my command, and upon his conviction I will demand a jail sentence with hard labor.\\" Police officers drove him from station to station, but failed to lodge charges against him. In all, he was held incommunicado for 22 hours. Chief Davis had planned to have Sinclair arraigned just before the close of court on Friday afternoon, effectively concealing his whereabouts by not pressing charges against him and movie him about in order to deny him his right to a writ of habeas corpus. Oaks' plan was thwarted when the plot was revealed to Sinclair's wife, Mary Craig, by a police official. Sinclair's attorneys were ready with a writ when he was finally brought to court. Charles P. Williams Charles P. Williams was the first African American policeman in the L.A.P.D. to be killed in the line of duty. Williams was working undercover when he was shot and killed by the owner of a house being used for prostitution. The owner was attempting to evict the prostitutes. Chief Oaks personally led the manhunt for his killer. (At the time, it was not publicly known that Williams was African American.) Termination Chief Oaks had a reputation as a hard-drinking womanizer. He was arrested by San Bernardino police, who discovered Oaks in the backseat of an automobile, accompanied by a \\"half-dressed woman and a half-empty bottle of whiskey.\\" Reform-minded Protestant clergymen, including the politically active radio preacher Robert P. \\"Fighting Bob\\" Shuler, who was the president of the Ministerial Union, targeted Oaks. Shuler and other Protestant ministers had been active in the reform and anti-vice movements in predominately Protestant Los Angeles, and they had applied direct political pressure on both the mayor and the Chief of Police. Shuler staked out a speakeasy and saw the Chief exiting in an inebriated state, accompanied by two women, neither of whom were his wife. After publicly revealing that had he seen Oaks womanizing and drinking (the latter being a crime during Prohibition), Oaks was ousted as chief by Mayor Cryer.

It is India's biggest naval airbase. The military air base has a civil enclave, that operates as Dabolim Airport. History INS Hansa was commissioned on 5 September 1961 at Sulur near Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu. It was initially co-located with the Sulur Air Force Station of the Indian Air Force. It was then home to INAS 551 squadron, operating de Havilland Vampire aircraft, as well as training establishments for Hawker Sea Hawk and Breguet Aliz√© aircraft. After the annexation of Goa in December 1961, INS Hansa was transferred to Dabolim. In 1983, the Indian Navy began inducting the BAE Sea Harrier into service, basing training activities at Dabolim until the Harriers were retired in 2016. Now the base houses MiG-29KUBs, the tandem two-seat operational trainer variant of the carrier based MIG-29Ks. The aircraft has been inducted into the Navy with a complement of 12 MiG 29Ks that have been purchased with the aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya (re-fitted and refurbished Admiral Gorshkov of the Russian Navy). Besides the operation of the MiGs, the Navy also operates Kamov Ka-28 anti submarine helicopters, along with Ilyushin Il-38 May and TU-142M Bear aircraft. Dabolim airbase also hosts exercises by the Indian Air Force's fighter bombers and it has facilities for the Indian Coast Guard which operates a fleet of small aircraft such as Dornier-228s. The Indian Navy also carries out long range maritime patrols as far as the Horn of Africa from Dabolim. The Navy has an aerobatic team, based at Dabolim, called the Sagar Pawan. The team comprises three Kiran aircraft which carry out aerobatic displays at various locations in the country. The team is used in one or two annual public events in Goa for flypasts of 15 to 20 minutes duration. The Navy also operates a naval aviation museum near Dabolim Airport. The Indian Navy's Shore Based Test Facility (SBTF), which is a mock-up of the INS Vikramaditya deck built on the airfield at Hansa is used to train and certify navy pilots of the Mikoyan MiG-29K for operating from the aircraft carrier, and for the developmental trials of the naval HAL Tejas. This SBTF was designed by Nevskoye Design Bureau (NDB) of Russia for Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA). Units Over 2000 naval personnel and 1000 civilians are employed at INS Hansa.

The university was initially founded in 1869. It is the oldest, largest, and most respected research university in the state and a member of the Consortium of Mexican Universities (CUMEX). CEVIDE building at UAEH. Historic central building. History The UAEH was the first university established in the state of Hidalgo, tracing its origins to the Instituto Literario y Escuela de Artes y Oficios (Literary Institute and School of Arts and Crafts), founded in Pachuca in February 1869 by various businessmen and promptly absorbed by the state government under Governor Juan C. Doria. In 1875, the new school moved from a rented house to the former San Juan de Dios Hospital, which had been founded in 1725; this structure is now the Central Building of the university. During the Mexican Revolution, the university was almost closed on several occasions, but it survived. In 1921, it absorbed other schools and became known as the Universidad de Hidalgo (University of Hidalgo), but it returned to its original name four years later. In the 1940s, the school added programs in medicine, law and engineering, and it acquired autonomy in 1948. As part of a push to develop new universities in Mexico and in response to an increasing need for higher education, on February 24, 1961, the 53rd Legislature of Hidalgo promulgated a decree creating the current Universidad Aut√≥noma del Estado de Hidalgo. The UAEH helped to found the Consortium of Mexican Universities (CUMEX) in 2005; its former rector, Luis Gil Borja, was the president of CUMEX from 2008 to 2010. Students The institution draws students from all 84 municipalities of the state, and from the central region of Mexico. The student population is approximately 40,000 students, mainly composed of students from the state capital and in-state territories, out-state students and a minority of international students. Campuses In addition to its main campuses in Pachuca, the UAEH has a presence across the state of Hidalgo, with facilities in Actopan, Apan, Atotonilco de Tula, Ciudad Sahag√∫n, Huejutla de Reyes, Mineral del Monte, Tepej√≠ del R√≠o, Tizayuca, Tlahuelilpan, Tulancingo and Zimap√°n, as well as four high schools both in the Pachuca and Tulancingo areas.

In this position he helped integrate the functions of Turnpike Authority into the existing state highway structure. =Secretary of Transportation= Later that year, Governor Deval Patrick chose Mullan to serve as the Secretary of the newly consolidated Department of Transportation. Mullan was the first person to serve jointly as transportation secretary and chief executive of the Department of Transportation. He was also responsible for integrating the department into four divisions. In 2011, Mullan came under fire after it was revealed that he did not inform Governor Patrick that a 110-pound light fixture in the Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Tunnel fell onto the roadway until more than five weeks had passed. On July 14, 2011 Mullan announced that he would step down as transportation secretary before the end of the year.

Its mission was to highlight the scale and pace of the retreat of the Arctic Ocean's floating sea ice. It is believed to be the only polar expedition to feature rowing boats since the crew of Sir Ernest Shackleton's row to Elephant Island off South Georgia in 1916, after his aborted attempt to cross Antarctica. The 450-mile journey took almost four weeks. The expedition set out from Resolute Bay on 28 July 2011, reaching the Pole position on 25 August. It was the first time any surface vessel under human power had been to any pole position. The expedition was the first attempt at such a voyage and was made possible by the open water in the Arctic region in summer. According to the National Snow and Ice Data Center, part of the University of Colorado, the Arctic sea ice melted to its third smallest extent (since 1979, when satellite measurements began) in September 2010. Prior to 1979 ice extents are unreliable. History The adventure was conceived by Scots adventurer Jock Wishart in 2007 when Wishart was in Resolute Bay, Nunavut, Canada for the biannual Polar Race, which he organises. Having just completed the race, he had taken a rowing machine out of the hotel onto the ice. A friend, seeing him, joked, \\"What are you going to do next Jock? Row to the Pole!\\" Jock Wishart publicly announced his intention and the expedition's financial sponsor, Scotch Whisky brand Old Pulteney, in April 2010. The attempt began on 28 July 2011. The crew departed from Resolute Bay, Cornwallis Island heading across the Wellington Channel to the coast of Devon Island. In open waters they made swift progress to the top of the island, encountering their first significant sea ice whilst navigating the Grinnell Peninsula. After rowing via Cornwall Island to the south coast of Ellef Ringnes Island, the crew sheltered for several days at Thor Island before making their last dramatic push for the Pole. This was achieved on a long continuous row beginning at 1800 hours on 4 August 2011. The boat rowed through open water with icebergs and floating sea ice around the Noice Peninsula through channels opened up by the winds and sea currents before reaching a dense area of ice that had been driven into the bay by storms. At this point the boat's unique design as a sledge-boat enabled them to haul the boat from the water and manually pull it across the ice on the final 2‚Äì3 miles to the Pole. This boat-hauling exercise took the crew 10 hours to complete. They arrived at the Pole position on 26 August 2011. Jock Wishart announced the success saying \\"There is now a row boat at the '96 Mag. North Pole\\". On BBC Radio 4's Today programme as \\"an incredible journey that will go down in the history books. It's a true global first and probably one of the greatest rows of all time.\\" Boat and crew The expedition was led by maritime and polar adventurer, explorer and sportsman Jock Wishart. His crew were Mark Delstanche, Billy Gammon David Mans, Rob Sleep and Mark Beaumont. Beaumont filmed the voyage for a BBC documentary 'Rowing the Arctic'. The expedition boat has three rowing positions on the open deck and berths for all six crew. It is self-righting and is fitted with additional equipment to enable it to be hauled out of the water onto ice and then pulled on its runners. As such it is a unique 'ice boat' design. The vessel has what is called a cathedral hull, so-named because of its profile resembling an upturned church roof. It was designed by Peter Bosgraaf, in collaboration with Welbourne Yacht Design. Hugh Welbourne advised on the laminates and under water construction, while Roger Daynes of advised on the design and construction of the \\"runners\\" on the bottom of the ice boat. The boat was built by Cris Rossiter in Christchurch, Dorset, UK.

After this Abdullah joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1919 and served as the secretary at the Iranian embassy in Washington, D.C. While in the United States, he studied mechanical engineering, which had always interested him, and married an American woman Margaret Robinson Hume, from whom he was subsequently divorced. They had a son, Hume Horan, who later joined the U.S. State Department and became a leading Arabist. In May 1958, he married Farah Ansari, granddaughter of Aliqoli Ansari Mosawer-al-Mamalek, to whom he was vaguely related. Her grandfather had been minister of foreign affairs several times.  Career: diplomacy and Sufism  Abbas Milani in his book on Eminent Persians says: \\"Both diplomacy and Sufism became inseparable parts of Abdullah‚Äôs character and career.\\" Iran's ambassador to France in 1927, Presented Iran‚Äôs case against Britain to the League of Nations in 1933, Iran's ambassador to West Germany, Minister of Finance under Mohammad Reza Shah, then Foreign Minister 1953-56, Negotiated the resumption of diplomatic relations with Britain and the oil contracts after Mossadegh. Chairman of the board of directors and Managing Director of NIOC (National Iranian Oil Company) 1957-63. Dismissed by the Shah after the uprisings of 1963, for suggesting that the pace of reforms should be slowed down. Marvin Zonis wrote on this subject in The Political Elite of Iran. p63 Dealing with the counter elite. According to Zonis, Hossein Ala the court minister, called together a council of elite statesmen to convey their mounting concern to the Shah, in relation to the extreme response of the military to demonstrations against the arrest of Khomeini in June 1963. People were demonstrating peacefully but the Shah had ordered troops to shoot and kill. The council of elite statesmen were: Ala himself, Abdollah Entezam, General Morteza Yazdanpanah, & Sardar Fakher Hekmat. After the four officials carried their foreboding to His Majesty, it was reported that the Shah was infuriated. Ala was relieved of his duties as minister of court, Yazdanpanah was dropped from the inspectorate, Hekmat was forbidden to campaign for the parliament & Entezam was retired from the National Iranian Oil Company and sent 'home'. Entezam then set up an ironmongery workshop from which he earned his living for the next 15 years. In 1978 the Shah realising his mistake begged him to return and accept the post of Prime Minister but it was too late. Entezam was too old and a revolution was well under way. There was nothing Entezam could do to dissuade the striking oil workers, despite the warm welcome that he received at the now in-turmoil oil company. p944 Raz e Bozorg.Mahmoud Toloie in Raz e Bozorg (the Big Secret) p.944 He advised the Shah to remain in the country and not flee to the West. Once again his advice was not heeded.  Patronage & Freemasonry  According to Abbas Milani's book 'The Persian Sphinx', he was the mentor of the Prime Minister Amir-Abbas Hoveida. Hoveida referred to him as arbab (the boss). Milani said in The Persian Sphinx (page 115): \\"In the mid-1950s when the Shah began to demand absolute obedience from all those around him, and as a token of this submission expected everyone to kiss the royal hand at each audience, Entezam was one of very few people in government who refused to comply.\\" He was also a Freemason, and in 1960, apparently at his behest, Hoveida (spelt Hoveyda by Milani) joined the Foroughi Lodge, newly created in 1960 with Entezam as its grand master. In Ismail Raeen's (also spelt Ra'in) book on Freemasonry in Iran, Faramooshkhaneh va Faramasonery dar Iran Vol3, p505, Hoveida is listed as a Freemason and Entezam as the grand master of the Independent Grand Lodge of Iran.The Persian sphinx: Amir Abbas Hoveyda and the riddle of the Iranian ...

According to Mahmoud Tolooie \\"although Entezam was a founder member of these Iranian lodges, he gave up on them after the death of Seyed Hassan Taghizadeh in 1970 and did not attend their meetings anymore\\".

The Surfcomber was built in 1948. It was acquired by the Kimpton hotel chain in April 2011 The hotel is known for pool parties, and served as headquarters for MTV during the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards and for Bud Light during 2010 Super Bowl XLIV. It is located on the shore of Miami‚Äôs South Beach. Architecture The Surfcomber Hotel circa 1950 The style of the hotel is an example of transitional architecture, bridging the ornamental styles of art deco from the 1930s with the streamlined and modern graphics language of the late forties and fifties. The architectural firm, MacKay & Gibbs, was also responsible for the design of several other art deco hotels in Miami, including the Sherbrooke Hotel, built in 1947. The Surfcomber is one of many historic buildings in the Miami Beach Architectural District, also called the Miami Beach Art Deco District. Art Deco is an eclectic artistic and design style that began in Paris in the 1920s and flourished internationally throughout the 1930s and 1940s. The Miami Beach Architectural District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. It has the largest collection of Art Deco architecture in the world and comprises hundreds of hotels, apartments and other structures built from the 1920s to the 1940s.

It is now a derelict structure that will be redeveloped to encourage year-round use, economic activity and public access. The Moran Plant is located at 475 Lake Street on the Burlington waterfront. It is named for Burlington mayor J.E. Moran.Burlington Electric Department retrieved October 4, 2009 The Moran Plant was decommissioned in 1986. Since then, the building has been vacant, except for a small portion of the basement utilized by the Lake Champlain Community Sailing Center. Ownership of the station was transferred from the Burlington Electric Department to the City of Burlington in 1990. In 2010, the city began executing plans for a rehabilitation of the plant and site. History In 1948, after a series of power shortages, the Burlington Electric Department argued that a new electric plant was now a critical need. Mayor Moran supported the plan. In 1951, Burlington Electric Department and the City of Burlington water department jointly purchased the lot that the Moran Plant sits on from the Central Vermont Railway. The contract for the new plant was awarded to Pierce Consulting Engineering Company in September. In November, voters approved a $4 million bond required for implementation. BED commissioners selected the Vermont Construction Company Inc. to erect the plant. The 1952 steel strike caused a six-week delay, and ground was broken in July 1952. The situation continued to deteriorate. Vermont Construction found itself in severe fiscal distress and Pierce Consulting's plans were decreed to be not only poor but also $2.2 million over budget. Both companies were dropped from the project and replaced by J.F. Pritchard Company in January 1953. The plant was fully completed in the summer of 1955. The Moran's three turbine generators and power switchgear assemblies, sold and installed by General Electric, Westinghouse and Allis- Chalmers, accounted for just over $1 million. The plant ‚Äì formally named the J. Edward Moran Municipal Generating Station in 1962 ‚Äì quickly became a source of angst for those who lived and worked downwind of it. Waste expelled from the smokestacks drifted down and covered everything within its path with a thick, black crust. Laundry hung out to dry was immediately dirty again, windows were covered in soot and multiple respiratory problems were reported. Burlington Electric Department made a series of changes to the plants to reduce the pollution. Although some improvement was noted, problems would persist throughout the 1960s and 1970s. The Moran Plant's role as a backup source of power was important in keeping the city illuminated during the Northeast blackout of 1965. =Changes= The 1970s energy crisis forced the Burlington Electric Department to seek new sources of fuel. In 1977, Burlington Electric Department employees tried an experimental conversion of one of the firing units from coal to wood chips mixed with one part of heating oil. Wood chips cost $12 per ton, as opposed to $50 ‚Äì a savings of 0.7¬¢. At a cost of $25,000 this in-house conversion took four months from design to fabrication and installation. The unit was retooled without federal grants or other technical assistance. Steampipes were recycled from other boilers and an old first-aid kit was used for the control box. Mother Jones pg. 13 Dec 1978 Vol. 3, No. 10 ISSN 0362-8841 Published by Mother Jones Approved by the New England Power Pool after a brief, three-week testing period this conversion gained global attention. A second coal-fired unit was successfully converted at the Moran during the summer of 1979. The Moran plant used more than 100,000 t of wood chips for fuel in addition to , of natural gas, and of No. 2 fuel oil in 1983. During the 1970s, most of the power supply for Burlington came from the Moran Plant, and its three 1950s-vintage, 10-MW stoker coal-fired units, struggled to meet Burlington's electric load growth. The aging of the Moran Plant, and its outdated emission controls prompted the Burlington Electric Department to examine ways to provide additional generating capacity to meet the city's needs. The Moran Plant was decommissioned in 1986. It was replaced by the McNeil Generating Station, a wood-chip burning facility at another location in Burlington. The boilers, exterior coal conveyor and stacks were removed, although the majority of the supporting steel framework was left in place. On the interior, the turbines and other equipment were also removed. Since then, the building has largely sat vacant, save for a small portion of the basement utilized by the Lake Champlain Community Sailing Center for boat storage. Ownership of the station was formally transferred from BED to the City of Burlington in 1990. In 2010, the city began executing plans for an ambitious rehabilitation of the plant and site for mixed community use. =Redevelopment= The City of Burlington has set forth the following principles to guide the redevelopment of the Moran Plant: *Ensure permanent public ownership and control *Create year-round use *Create and extend elements of the Waterfront Park *Minimize undue traffic and parking issues *Retain the Lake Champlain Sailing Center *Provide opportunity for new public and private partnerships *Utilize the existing building shell where cost- effective *Retain historical elements of interior of North Tower when possible *Generate income for operations and maintenance *Keep development costs reasonable *Utilize the highest standards in energy conservation and green building construction Burlington voters approved a $21 million renovation plan for the Moran plant on March 4, 2008. It passed overwhelmingly approximately 11,000 to 700. Mayor Bob Kiss wanted to turn the Moran Plant into a sailing center, children's museum and ice climbing facility. Opponents wanted the old power plant to be torn down. An advisory question on the ballot asked whether Burlington residents wanted to demolish the plant and create a park. That measure was defeated by 874 votes. The Vermont legislature approved a public financing scheme for the Moran Plant in September 2009. At its September 10 meeting, the legislature's Joint Fiscal Committee voted to let Burlington borrow money for infrastructure improvements in anticipation of future tax revenues generated through 2015 on the existing waterfront and the downtown tax increment finance district. Building =Exterior= The Moran has a two-part exterior: load-bearing, masonry frame consisting of concrete masonry units with a brick header course every two rows, and a brick veneer laid in a common bond with seventh course header rows. Some bricks have detached and some are delaminating. The tall northerly block of the Moran is distinguished by not only its height, but also by the remains of a massive exterior steel boiler structure. =Interior= The Moran Plant has an exposed, floating interior steel frame which engages the exterior, load-bearing masonry walls. Finishes have been significantly vandalized and large areas exhibit wholesale loss, breakage and graffiti. The basement, although the sluiceways had been dammed in the late 20th century, remained partially flooded until 2010 and contained a considerable amount of submerged industrial and contaminated debris. Although the turbines were removed on decommissioning in 1986, their massive concrete cradles were left in place ‚Äì as were three substantial coal hoppers and remnants of industrial fixtures, including the coal conveyor on the upper level of the hopper block and large copper coil units on the second level of the turbine block. Throughout the building, remnants of steel stairs, catwalks and related structural supports connect the different areas. Significance The Moran Municipal Generation Station is on the National Register of Historic Places. It was listed on December 17, 2010. Its applicable National Register Criteria were, \\"Property is associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of our history,\\" and \\"Property embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction or represents the work of a master, or possesses high artistic values, or represents a significant and distinguishable entity whose components lack individual distinction.\\" The mid- century coal-fired electricity-generating plant was the only one of its kind erected in Vermont and gained international acclaim for innovative uses and adaptations of existing technologies. Pritchard's design for the Moran Plant, which was featured in Architectural Record, may have been influenced by the 1950 Sewaren Generating Station in Woodbridge, New Jersey, which followed a similar, stepped plan (a three-story service building, a taller turbine room, and an even taller coal bunker with exterior boiler structure and stacks). Lake Champlain Community Sailing Center The Lake Champlain Community Sailing Center is a non-profit organization that operates around the Moran Plant. It offers boating-related educational and recreational opportunities.

Famed San Antonio architect Alfred Giles submitted the winning bid on February 27, 1907. The courthouse was completed in 1909 for $46,918. The Beaux-Arts building features a curved judge's bench. A stained glass window features \\"Justice\\" holding the scales. Tile floors are in the Mediterranean style. Alamo Iron Works produced the wrought iron staircases. Interior doors are solid wood with brass knobs. Mansard roofed terminal pavilions feature stone-carved rams head accents. The building features yellow brick with dressings of white stone and red tile mansard roofs. The landscaping includes pecan trees and citrus trees. A cornerstone records the contractor, H. Sparbert, and architect, Alfred Giles, 1909. Many of Alfred Giles' buildings have been demolished over the years. This fine example of his work shows why he continues to have the respect of architects, historians, and laymen alike. In November 2010, the county held an art contest to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the courthouse. County Judge Danny Valdez and Javier Santos of the Fernando A.

The oldest existing church in central Helsinki, the church was originally planned as a temporary building as the Ulrika Eleonora Church constructed in 1727 had become too small for the congregation and the new church, Helsinki Cathedral, would not be completed until 1852. However, the city's rapid population growth from the early 19th century onwards ensured that the church would remain needed, and also necessitated the construction of many other churches.  History  Helsinki Old Church in 1908. The neoclassical wooden church was built under Engel's supervision between 1824 and 1826 and consecrated on 17 December 1826 by dean Johan Borgstr√∂m. When the Ulrika Eleonora Church was demolished, the recovered building materials and part of the movables were auctioned but some of the furnishings including the pulpit, benches and chandeliers as well as the organ were relocated to the newly built church. These furnishings were however replaced over the years with the exception of the pulpit. A new 36 stop organ built by Per Larsson √Ökermann was installed in 1869. The altarpiece painted by Robert Wilhelm Ekman was initially commissioned for Helsinki Cathedral, but was instead placed in the Old Church in 1854.  Park  The church is located in a recreational park maintained by the city and called Old Church Park (). The park is sometimes colloquially called Plague Park () as over a thousand victims of the 1710 plague are buried next to the park. The park itself was a cemetery from the 1780s until shortly after the church's construction. Its use as a graveyard was discontinued when the Hietaniemi Cemetery was consecrated in 1829, although some victims of the Finnish Civil War and fallen Finnish volunteers of the Estonian War of Independence were buried there in 1918 and 1919, respectively. Some 40 gravestones and memorials, as well as the Sederholm tomb remain of the cemetery.

Their style is a blend of ska, reggae, nostalgia for the 1960s rock-n-roll and the great romantic groups of the 1970s, in addition a romantic style of their own. They are part of the musical movement called the Avanzada Regia.  History  Inspector was born in November 1995 with a group of kids who were looking for fun, to create good music and enjoy themselves. After achieving their initial goals as a band, they recorded an independent album called Blanco y Negro (1993) that made them known in the music scene of their hometown of Monterrey and other cities such as Guadalajara, San Luis Potos√≠, Leon, Quer√©taro and Mexico City. During this time the group's lineup began to take shape. Soon they began to be recognized in the ska scene in Mexico thanks to their songs and their unique style, which is essentially reggae and ska, but also crosses through genres such as jazz and rockabilly with rhythmic touches and romantic lyrics with which the public identified immediately. In 1998, they won the prize \\"Nuestro Rock\\" for best new group which caused them to perform in more cities. After a long road and hundreds of concerts throughout Mexico, in 2001 they were signed by the record company Universal Music Mexico and released their album Alma en fuego, an album that would go platinum due to its high sales and which resulted in their first single \\"Amnesia\\", which they performed in collaboration with Roco (vocalist from the group Maldita Vecindad) and Ruben Albarran (vocalist for Caf√© Tacuba). This first single was followed by the singles \\"Amargo Adi√≥s\\", \\"Cara de chango,\\" \\"Sin rencor\\" and the footballing theme \\"Aguante\\". Alma en Fuego was nominated for a Lo Nuestro Award for Rock/Alternative Album of the Year while the band was listed for Rock New Artist at the 16th Lo Nuestro Awards, losing both to Chilean band La Ley and Mexican singer Alessandra Rosaldo, respectively. In 2008, they released their third album, Unidad, Cerveza y Ska, an album where the idea was to give continuity between ska and the Mexican-ness and style of the band. From this production the following singles were released: \\"Ska Voovee Boobie Baby,\\" \\"C√≥mo te extra√±o\\" and \\"Por √∫ltima vez\\" In 2009, their fourth album, Amar o morir, was released, where Inspector tried to re-discover their own style and express it in a fresh and interesting way by \\"travelling\\" through rhythms that range from punk to soul, or blues to funk through Ska. Their first single from this album is \\"El Dejado\\". Inspector returned in 2009 with their fifth production called \\"INSPECTOR\\", now produced independently with 13 tracks, among which are the covers: \\"Besame Mucho\\" and the Madness classic \\"Our House\\", also included in this material is a duet of the track \\"November\\" with the Mexican singer Ely Guerra.

Most of the lists are of the earliest inhabitants of a particular town or area.  Indian tribes and leaders  Ninigret in 1681 The following people lived in Rhode Island prior to Colonial settlement: Wampanoag people lived throughout Plymouth Colony and around Mount Hope Bay in Bristol, Rhode Island *Massasoit, tribal leader, met the Pilgrims at Plymouth *Wamsutta, son of Massasoit, became tribal leader upon father's death but died shortly after *Metacomet, son of Massasoit, succeeded his brother as tribal leader; colonists gave him the name of Philip, at his request; instigated King Philip's War Narragansett people lived throughout the Rhode Island colony *Canonicus, chief sachem, deeded the land to Roger Williams on which he established Providence Plantations *Miantonomo, nephew of Canonicus, sold Samuel Gorton and others the land to establish Warwick, Rhode Island *Canonchet, son of Miantonomo, led Narragansets during the Great Swamp Fight and accepted his own death at the end of King Philip's War *Pumham, lesser sachem of Kent County, Rhode Island *Soconoco, lesser sachem of the same area as Pumham Niantic people lived around the Pawcatuck River in the southwestern corner of Rhode Island *Ninigret, kept the Niantics neutral during King Philip's War *Harman Garrett, Indian governor, and nephew of Ninigret Nipmuc people wandered within Rhode Island Colony, mostly from the north  First European settler  *William Blackstone, settled along the Blackstone River in Cumberland, Rhode Island (1634-35), part of the Plymouth Colony at the timeArnold, 98-9  First settlers of Providence  Narragansett Indians receiving Roger Williams Roger Williams was banished from the Massachusetts Bay Colony in October 1635 but was allowed to remain at his home in Salem, Massachusetts until the end of winter, provided that he did not preach. However, his followers visited him at his home in sizable numbers, and the authorities deemed this to be preaching. They planned to apprehend him by force and put him on a ship for England in January 1636, but magistrate John Winthrop warned him privately, and he slipped away from Salem in the dead of winter to find shelter with the Wampanoags. He bought a parcel of land in Seekonk from Wampanoag sachem Massasoit which was at the western edge of the Plymouth Colony (now Rehoboth, Massachusetts). In a 1677 statement, Williams mentioned the four who were with him at Seekonk. The five members of the group were:Arnold, 97Bicknell, 1:158 *Roger Williams *William Harris *John Smith (miller) *Francis Wickes (a minor) *Thomas Angell The original 1636 deed for Providence, signed by Canonicus In the spring of 1636, Williams and his company planted crops at Seekonk but were informed in a gentle letter from Governor Edward Winslow of Plymouth that they were within Plymouth's jurisdiction, and this fact would cause difficulties with the Massachusetts authorities. Without urgency, Winslow suggested that Williams and his group move across the Seekonk River into the territory of the Narragansetts, where no colony had any claim. By this time, it is likely that the family members of the original settlers had joined the group, and two other families also joined the settlement. Joshua Verin wrote a statement in 1650 mentioning \\"we six which came first to Providence\\", suggesting that he was the next to join the original five.Chapin, 11 Also, Benedict Arnold later wrote, \\"Memm. We came to Providence to Dwell the 20th of April, 1636\\". Providence had not yet been established, so he probably was referring to Seekonk where the Arnolds came from Hingham, Massachusetts to join the other settlers.Chapin, 11 It is likely, therefore, that the following 25 people crossed the river from Seekonk in the Plymouth Colony sometime around June 1636, to a location on the Moshassuck River in Narragansett territory which Williams named Providence Plantations:Chapin, 17 *Roger Williams with wife Mary and daughters Mary and Freeborn *William Harris with wife Susannah and son Andrew *John Smith with wife Alice and children John Jr. and Elizabeth *Francis Wickes *Thomas Angell (a minor) *Joshua Verin with wife Jane *William Arnold with wife Christian, daughter Joanne, and sons Stephen and Benedict *William Carpenter with wife Elizabeth (the daughter of William Arnold) *William Mann with wife Frances Hopkins (the niece of William Arnold) *Thomas Hopkins, still a minor, nephew of William Arnold and ancestor of Governor Stephen Hopkins  Providence civil compact, 1637  Several young men were admitted as inhabitants to Providence before the settlement was a year old, but they were discontented with their position and wanted to be able to vote and otherwise have equality with the older settlers. The following resolution was adopted in a town meeting on August 20, 1637 and is sometimes called the \\"civil compact.\\" The 1637 date was on the original town records, but when they were transcribed in 1800, the page containing that date was missing. The text of the resolution is as follows: > We, whose names are hereunder, desirous to inhabit in the town of > Providence, do promise to subject ourselves in active or passive obedience > to all such orders or agreements as shall be made for public good of our > body, in an orderly way, by the major assent of the present inhabitants, > master of families, incorporated together into a town fellowship, and others > whom they shall admit unto them only in civil things. *Richard Scott *William Reynolds X his mark *John Field X his mark *Chad Browne *John Warner *George Richard *Edward Cope *Thomas Angell X his mark (now an adult) *Thomas Harris *Francis Wickes X his mark (now an adult) *Benedict Arnold (now an adult) *Joshua Winsor *William Wickenden  Original proprietors of Providence  Those named in a deed from Roger Williams, dated about October 8, 1638:Arnold, 100 *Roger Williams *Stukeley Westcott (left Salem about March 1638) *William Arnold *Thomas James (was minister at Charlestown; Providence by June 1637; left for New Haven in 1639) *Robert Coles (was earlier at Roxbury, Ipswich, and Salem)Austin, 50 *John Greene (had departed Boston by March 1636) *John Throckmorton (was at Salem earlier)Austin, 200 *John Sweet *William Harris *William Carpenter *Thomas Olney (left Salem about March 1638) *Francis Weston (left Salem about March 1638)Anderson (1995), p. 1967 *Richard Waterman (left Salem about March 1638)Anderson (1995), p. 1943 *Ezekiel Holyman (left Salem about March 1638)Austin, 102  Pawtuxet settlers  Pawtuxet River near where the Arnolds settled Those settlers who left Providence to settle on the north side of the Pawtuxet River about 1638, putting themselves under the jurisdiction of Massachusetts Bay Colony from 1642 to 1658:Arnold, 102Bicknell, 1:143Moriarty, 20:227 *William Arnold *Benedict Arnold, moved to Newport in 1651 *William Carpenter *Thomas Hopkins, did not stay long *William Mann, did not stay long *Robert Coles *William Harris, did not stay long *Zachariah Rhodes (married Joanna, daughter of William Arnold), did not stay long *William Field, did not stay long *Stukeley Westcott, moved to Warwick about 1643  Signers of Providence agreement for a government, 1640  Town layout of Providence showing land plots of many of the earliest settlers Those 39 Providence settlers who signed an agreement to form a government on July 27, 1640: *Chad Brown *Robert Coles *William Harris *John Throckmorton *Stukely Westcott *Benedict Arnold *William Carpenter *Richard Scott *Thomas Harris *Francis Wickes X his mark *Thomas Angell X his mark *Adam Goodwin X his mark *William Burrows X his mark *Roger Williams *Robert West *Joshua Winsor *Robert Williams *Matthew Waller *Gregory Dexter *John Lippitt X his mark *John Warner *John Field *William Arnold *William Field *Edward Cope *Edward Manton X his mark *William Man *Nicholas Power *William Reynolds X his mark *Thomas Olney *Richard Waterman *William Wickenden *Edward Hart *Hugh Bewit *Thomas Hopkins X his mark *Joan Tiler (widow) *Jane Sears X her mark (widow) *Christopher Unthank *William Hawkins X his mark  Settlers of Cocumscussoc (Wickford) area  Smith's Castle, home of Richard Smith Those early settlers who had trading posts in the area of Wickford in what was then the \\"Narragansett country\\" and later a part of North Kingstown, Rhode Island:Arnold, 195 *Richard Smith, built a trading post established about 1637 where his house Smith's Castle still stands, rebuilt by Richard, Jr. after King Philip's War *Roger Williams, built his trading post about a mile north from Smith's post along the Pequot Path (or Post Road) and occupied it from about 1644 to 1651 and then sold it to Smith to get funds for his proposed errand to England *Mr. Wilcox (possibly Edward or John), built his trading post in the early 1640s in the same general area  Founders of Portsmouth  Portsmouth Compact Supporters of Anne Hutchinson who signed the Portsmouth Compact, dated March 7, 1638: *William Coddington *John Clarke *William Hutchinson, husband of Anne Hutchinson *John Coggeshall *William Aspinwall *Samuel Wilbore *John Porter *John Sanford *Edward Hutchinson, Jr., oldest son of William and Anne Hutchinson *Thomas Savage *William Dyer, husband of Mary Dyer *William Freeborn *Philip Shearman *John Walker *Richard Carder *William Baulston *Edward Hutchinson, Sr., brother of William Hutchinson *Henry Bull (signed with a mark) *Randall Holden *Thomas Clarke *John Johnson *William Hall *John Brightman The last four names on the list were crossed out, but these men nevertheless came to Portsmouth or Newport.  Inhabitants of Aquidneck Island (1638)  The following individuals were among the earliest settlers of Aquidneck Island in the Narragansett Bay; the island was officially named Rhode Island by 1644,Office of the Secretary of State: A. Ralph Mollis: State Library Rhode Island Office of the Secretary of State, archived November 17, 2010 from the original from which the entire colony eventually took its name. The first group of 58 names appears to be settlers of Pocasset (later Portsmouth), while the second group of 42 appears to be settlers of Newport. These two lists come from Bartlett's Records of the Colony of Rhode Island, and apparently they were compiled and incorporated into the town records of Newport on November 25, 1639. The actual arrival dates of the individuals likely span over several months during 1638; a few individuals have legible dates next to their names, while several others have illegible dates.

Member of the family Gaudart of India, son of Joseph-James Gaudart and Eug√©nie Le Gay. He became a Jesuit priest, but he was released from his vows by Pope Pius XII. On 14 April 1951, he was married, at Innsbruck (Austrian Tyrol), to Dorothea Johanna H√ºbel. They were divorced in Austria on 15 October 1957. Landesgericht f√ºr Zivilrechtssachen, Vienna (Austria). After leaving the religious world, Gaudart became a film producer/director and made several films. He had started his film and sound career after the Second World War, when he was recording interviews and plays for some European radio broadcasters. He moved on to film very quickly and became a TV producer in the 1950s. Although already being successful in Canada, he moved on to Mexico. For one film, he was in Mexico, where he died (officially on 4 July 1959, his burial date) in rather odd circumstances.

The Fables of La Fontaine A still taken from the Fables of La Fontaine films Marc Gaudart produced the Canadian television series Fables of La Fontaine (or Tales of La Fontaine). As a French producer in Canada, Marc Gaudart was responsible for this series of fifteen-minute fables with animal characters, based on stories by the 17th century poet La Fontaine. The films employed the talents of animals from the farm of Lorna Jackson in Mount Albert, Ontario. Gaudart set the animals (mostly small, relatively tame kind, such as parrots, frogs, cats, and pigeons) in miniature sets to \\"act out\\" the stories. Cinematographer Fritz Spiess had to spend \\"hours studying each of the animals used in the series to get to know the different problems posed by each--such as a mouse who refused to ride in canoes, a bored monkey who was fascinated by studio wires and rafters, and a rabbit who became so fond of sitting in a jeep that he refused to get out and race with a turtle\\".

History of the domain, Institution des Invalides de la Legion Etrangere Due to the generosity of the friends of the Foreign Legion and all Legion officers, sous-officiers, and legionnaires, a vast hemicycle structure was built, capable of housing all the needing veterans of the French Foreign Legion. Built since 1953 and inaugurated on May 15, 1955 by g√©n√©ral K≈ìnig, this center followed the Moral Service of the Legion () which was attached in a part at the corps of the garrisons, in charge of welcoming conversions of the legionnaires that were wounded or sick and also is in charge of reforming soldiers to be able to adapt to normal life and surroundings. This center, equally designated as Domain Captain Danjou (the officer who commanded a legion detachment which illustrated capability at Camar√≥n) is financed by the different legion units. The domain, also houses as well the Legionnaire Uniform Museum.

In the late Cambrian period (510 m.y.a), this area was a beach and shoreline, and the quarry is well known for abundant fossil impressions of Climactichnites, Protichnites, and beached jellyfish, Scyphozoan Medusae. Pre- Devonian evidence of this jellyfish is exceedingly rare; this location and one in New Brunswick hold the only known fossils. The fossilized tracks of Climactichnites and Protichnites are also amongst the best preserved examples in the world. No fossilized remains of the either animal exist, making them enigmatic species. The quality and quantity of these fossil tracks in the quarry are extremely valuable to paleontologists.  History  Krukowski Quarry was founded in 1978 by Jeff Krukowski in Irma Hill and Blackberry Hill near Mosinee, Wisconsin, and is owned by Krukowski and his wife and children. The Krukowski Stone Company, incorporated in May 1984, manages the quarry. At present, the quarry has over 1,000 acres of quarriable land and possesses 37,000 feet of European sawing equipment. The quarry is known for sedimentary rock slabs used in applications such as countertops.  Paleontology  The quarry is known for Cambrian fossils that have been discovered since its founding. The most prominent fossils found at the quarry are scyphozoan medusae (true jellyfish) ranging in diameter from 50-70 centimeters, the largest jellyfish in the fossil record; these were initially discovered in 1998 by Dan Damrow, who published with paleontologist James Hagadorn. Paleontologists have also discovered slug- and mollusk-like climactichnites, as well as fossilized trackways of anthropods (including protichnites and diplichnites), and stromatolites including elephant skin, sand-chips, and domal sand stromatolites.

She gained international attention in the late 1980s with a series of six tapestries, Images of the Holocaust, completed between 1979 and 1989. They were first exhibited as a series at the \\"Sazama-Brauer Gallery\\" in Chicago in 1988. Their imagery and texts are based on historical photographs of victims of Nazi persecution, such as ones by Mendel Grossman, and other materials that Nezhnie collected from the Library of Congress, National Archives, the Pentagon and the Yad Vashem Archives in Israel. The majority of commissioned work she produced is religious in nature and predominantly Jewish in theme. One notable exception is Imprints, two large curved tapestries that hang suspended above the stairway of the University City Library in St. Louis, Missouri, completed in 1971. She also did a wide range of private commissions and experimental pieces that feature portraits or animated figures often discarding the conventional rectangular format. Biography Nezhnie was the child of ethnic Jewish immigrants from the Russian empire and identified fundamentally with photographs of persecuted European Jews published in the daily newspapers.Castro, 40 She showed an aptitude for painting very early. While in high school during the late 1940s, she traveled to the Jefferson School of Social Science in New York City on Saturdays for art lessons. Later, in art school at The Cooper Union, she was thwarted from pursuing portraiture and chose to get a degree in graphic design.Rees 8‚Äì9 She discovered that tapestry was still a viable contemporary art form by chance on a trip to Paris while her husband, fellow art student Sheldon Helfman, was stationed in Germany. She enrolled at a craft school, Offenbach Werkkunstschule in the Frankfurt suburb of Offenbach am Main. It was her only formal training in weaving. The Helfman family moved to St. Louis, Missouri in 1960. In 1964 Nezhnie was one of six founding members of Craft Alliance Gallery, which is still operating in St. Louis as of 2010. She was on Craft Alliance's board of directors for 16 years. She represented the United States as the invited artist in the 1986 juried biennial tapestry exhibition, \\"\\"Panorama in Tapestry\\"\\" in Toronto, Canada organized by the American Tapestry Alliance (ATA) with Marcel Marois representing Canada. In 1990 she was the keynote speaker at the \\"\\"Tapestry Forum\\"\\", an international gathering of tapestry artists in Portland, Oregon. Two years later Nezhnie was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts for her contribution to art from the University of Missouri, St. Louis. She was already suffering from Alzheimer's disease and the honor coincided with the end of her career in 1992. = Home life = Nezhnie was the only child of Jean Shiezer Liftman and Isadore Nezhnie. Both parents had children from previous marriages that were 8 or more years older than she. Young Muriel was alone in their apartment until her youngest stepsister came home from school because her mother worked in the store below their living quarters, checking in upstairs at slow moments. Nezhnie began drawing at an early age as a way to entertain herself and was encouraged by her sister who enjoyed drawing. Her childhood was further marred by the death of her father when she was six and then four years later, her sister who had taken care of her died in a freak train accident. [3] At the time, newspapers were publishing photographs of persecuted Jews that had a fundamental influence on Nezhnie. As the child of non-practicing Russian Jewish immigrants living in a non-Jewish neighborhood of Jersey City, New Jersey, she set out to discover what it meant to be a Jew by enrolling herself in a class at the local temple.  Acquiring skills  Her introduction to weaving happened in a unique manner when she was in sixth grade of school. A teacher wanted the students to use \\"potholder looms\\" to create squares that could be joined into blankets to send to the Russian War Relief. The only student who excelled in the weaving, Nezhnie was told to keep on weaving during class and just listen to the lesson until enough squares were made for the blankets. She later recalled that she \\"learned about ancient Egypt and the Reconstruction period after the Civil War‚Ä¶ while industriously making colorful woven squares.Rees 4 During the late 1940s and early 1950s, while taking Saturday art classes in New York City at the Jefferson School of Social Science, Muriel solidified her interest in becoming a portrait artist. Large portraits of Communist dignitaries flanking the wall of the school's hallways made a deep impression on her. However, as a student at The Cooper Union, (1952‚Äì1955) she battled the strong bias of that era towards abstraction and was told that she would have to leave if she continued painting figuratively. An interest in calligraphy and earlier participation in the school paper and yearbooks in high school inspired Nezhnie to shift majors to graphic design. She excelled in the print format, acquiring skills and a perspective that influenced both subject matter and her stylistic approach throughout her weaving career.Rees, 8‚Äì9,134 She married fellow art student, Sheldon Helfman, in 1954. After her graduation in 1955, she joined him in Germany where he was stationed in the U.S. Army. Perceiving that her opportunity to paint while her husband, who was equally passionate about painting, had to spend his time on duty was putting stress on their marriage, she began looking for other creative outlets. Nezhnie discovered tapestry was still a viable contemporary art form on a trip to Paris. Quite convinced that she could weave better examples than those she observed that day, she enrolled at a craft school, Offenbach Werkkunstschule, in the Frankfurt suburb of Offenbach am Main. Even though she did not speak German, nor her instructors speak English, this was her only formal training in weaving.  Early artwork  After Helfman's tour of duty, they moved to New Haven, CT, where he received a Master of Fine Arts degree at Yale University and their two children, Ilisha and Jonathan were born. The family moved to St. Louis Missouri in 1960. The consequence of limited communication with her instructors in Germany became apparent as Nezhnie had to struggle through the technicalities of setting up the loom and learning what materials would work best. However she quickly began producing tapestries. By 1963, she completed a woven commission for a local Children's Hospital and in 1967, completed her first large commission, Genesis, 132\\" x 84\\". She also wove at least 16 freeform or non-rectilinear tapestries by the decade's end. Some were termed \\"the little people\\", measuring under 24\\" in the largest dimension and typically were only rectilinear at the base. Many appeared quite \\"primitive\\". In general, they were woven on two-colored warps. Originally used to help her thread the loom, two-colored warps became a signature feature of her weavings. Another group, primarily woven in 1968‚Äì69, consisted of large bold female figures whose arms and torso are circular in form suspended on curved armatures. By comparison, commissions for private clients woven during this period were surprisingly formal in design with intricately woven detail and complex imagery. Odyssey 60\\" x 60\\" woven in 1967 as a private commission; Large Embrace 41\\" x 29\\" woven in 1968 typical of the \\"Little people\\" series; and Loreli 58\\" x 47\\" woven in 1969 is one of the large female figures displayed on armatures. The three tapestries illustrate the wide range of styles created in Nezhnie's early career. Soon after arriving in St. Louis she assessed the art scene as lacking opportunity for local artists to sell their work. In 1964, Nezhnie was one of six founding members of Craft Alliance Gallery, which is still operating in St. Louis, Missouri, as of 2010. She was on Craft Alliance's board of directors for 16 years. Living in near vicinity to the gallery, she became the person often called to solve problems.  Major commissions  The Guild for Religious Architecture Conference Exhibition awarded Nezhnie a merit award for Genesis in 1969, as well as honorable mentions in 1971 and 1972. Besides Imprints, which had two curved panels each 80\\" x 192\\" depicting graphic symbols and reference to books, she produced 11 tapestries for religious institutions during the first 5 years of the 1970s. These included three distinct interpretations of Jacob's Dream. The 1971 St. Louis version, an ark curtain, measured 216\\" x 96\\" and the 1973 Farmington Hills, MI, ark curtain was 256\\" x 120\\". The 1975 Boston Jacob's Dream was a triangular shape fabricated in rughooking by Edward Fields, Inc., in New York City. Exodus, an earlier massive 414 sq. ft. ark curtain was also fabricated in the technique. Hooking was an efficient means of producing irregular shapes for large commissions. Nezhnie's studio was set up in the basement of the Helfmans' home where three looms enabled apprentices to weave during the day and Muriel to work at night to accomplish the quantity of weaving needed for these projects. The whole Helfman family was involved in the details of studio life, helping with finishing details when needed.Rees  Personal expression  The emergence of pop art in the 1960s reinforced her direction toward both portraiture and print media by 1970. The freedom to incorporate realistic imagery was heightened when she discovered the work of tapestry artist, Helena Hernmarck. Not only did Hernmarck use contemporary subject matter and calligraphy, her style had \\"surprise created by the discrepancy in what the viewer saw from a distance and at close range.\\"Rees 77 Nezhnie's first major personal work of the 1970s was the 60\\" x 138\\" Wild Cherry Charms in 1971. Five girls dressed in Halloween costumes pose on the viewer's right side, with larger-than-life faces of two of them on the left. Large circles appear in front of the figures with letters of a Cherry Charm candy wrapper running sideways across the tapestry. Many more innovative figurative works followed, including her most ambitious non-rectilinear star shaped Constellation, spanning 84\\". Perhaps Nezhnie's best examples of dichotomy between what appears to be realistic imagery at a distance but becomes unrecognizable color fields when viewed at a few feet are Shining Knight, a portrait woven in nubby brown cotton on a backdrop of shiny mylar, and Nader, which is a very long, 39\\"x188\\", magnification of Ralph Nader's eye and eyebrows. In general, she created the images by altering the form of lines. In the case of Nadar the details appear to cluster or cling to the rhythmical vertical lines creating convincingly attractive abstract shapes. In the later 1970s she wove small 7\\" or 8\\" lustrous silk portraits framed by dark brown raw silk borders. During the decade, she wove at least 13 portraits, many as private commissions. In all, she executed over 45 tapestries during the 1970s, including the first of the Holocaust series, Daughters of Auschwitz, in 1979.Rees 71‚Äì96  Holocaust series  File:NezhnieDaughtersofEarth3.jpgDaughters of Earth 81\\" x 53\\" 1981 Holocaust series A pivotal experience for Nezhnie occurred during a trip to Europe in 1973, when she viewed the Bayeux Tapestry, an embroidered account of the Normandy invasion of England that stretches for 110 feet. Its role in recording a major conflict through a long series of graphic scenes with written commentary provided the direction she needed for commenting on the Nazis and the Jews. However, she struggled for more than 4 years before gaining the confidence to work on such emotive material.Castro 38 She started by hunting down visual accounts of brutality, yet her goal in designing for these tapestries was to find a balance that would attract viewers enough to the overall image to really look at the unpleasant incident depicted. Placing text within the design would effectively draw the viewer deeper into the content. According to Rees: \\"Once the image and corresponding text was determined, she called on all her design skills, first to create a color palette that was subdued but appealing, then to hone the image down to essential details in order to give potency to the message.\\"Rees 117 Five tapestries were displayed at the Sazama-Brauer Gallery in Chicago in 1988: Daughters of Auschwitz, 60'x54', 1978; Daughters of the Earth, 81\\"x53\\", 1981; Ghetto Child‚ÄîStroop Report, 60\\"x48\\" 1982; Liberation, 56\\"x47\\", 1987; Deportation, 54\\"x53\\", 1988. One painting on non-stretched canvas, Parting Lodz, 48\\"x96\\", 1987; was included in this exhibit. It had grommets along its edges for mounting. The sixth tapestry, Pogrom, 64\\" x 48\\", was not finished until 1989. Rees claims: \\"Several examinations are required to come to terms with the piece. Once really seen, its masterful depiction of brutality serves as the culmination of what Nezhnie was trying to accomplish: tapestries that are hard to dismiss.\\"Rees127 Nezhnie included her cartoons, the schematic line drawings placed behind the weaving surface during production, and preliminary drawings along with the actual tapestries. This offered a very novel viewing experience; with the effect of duplicating her message many times as the viewer circled the gallery. In the book, A Mission in Art: Recent Holocaust Works in America, Vivian Alpert Thompson defines Nezhnie as an \\"empathizer\\": \\"The empathy of the artists who are not survivors is at times so deep that some of them have taken on characteristics normally attributable to survivors‚Ä¶\\" and, like for survivors, \\"the creation of these works is not cathartic for the artist‚Ä¶ likely because the conditions of evil that their art warns against still exist.\\"Thompson 47  Impact on the tapestry medium  According to Sharon Marcus, an educator, artist and critic regarding contemporary tapestry, Nezhnie was ahead of her time: \\"many of the technical innovations that contemporary artists are interested in today were utilized abundantly by Nezhnie, in particular shaped weaving and contrast of texture and weave structure.\\"Marcus, Handwoven, January/February 2006 Nezhnie's limited training in the tapestry medium was less a deterrent than an impetus for discovering her own unique style. In the book NEZHNIE: Weaver & Innovative Artist, Rees suggests that; \\"In her early work, she started to determine what was essential to the process and to examine to what extent the structure of weaving could be altered. This led to the conclusion that neither the rectangular format nor a uniform, weft-faced weave need limit her visual expression‚Ä¶ the more the structural features were revealed, the more lively and effective the image became.\\" Thus she would judiciously let one or both of the warp colors (often orange and green yarns) show through in designated shapes or she allowed the warp ends to be seen as small bead-like knots at the edges of the weaving, even in the Holocaust series. During her mid career work, she explored ways of providing interest by forming novel interactions within the details being created. \\"In weaving, imagery is created with lines of yarn and the horizontal layering of color. ‚Ä¶Controlling line to produce color and definition in weaving is similar to working with the dots in printing. Her creative solutions for manipulating line are a significant contribution to the tapestry community.\\"Rees 130 \\"It is fortuitous that Nezhnie chose to switch to graphic design. ‚Ä¶ Intensive classes in graphic design gave her a broader scope of options for interpreting imagery than she would have had ‚Ä¶if she only specialized in painting. Methods of combining color in printing are actually more compatible with weaving than the means most often used by painters in blending colors.\\"Rees 134 This is because, like ink, each yarn is typically a solid color.

The transportation center is also served by Indian Trails intercity bus service and Suburban Mobility Authority for Regional Transportation (SMART) regional bus service.  Description  The current transportation center is located on the southern edge of downtown at 51000 Woodward Avenue. It is about and includes an indoor waiting room, restrooms, a payphone, and covered waiting areas for both trains and buses. However, it does not have any ticketing services or baggage assistance (bags cannot be checked for trains at the transportation center), not even a Quik-Trak kiosk. There are 22 long term parking spaces available and the station hours are from 5:15 am to 6:15 am and from 10:00 am to 6:00 pm daily. In addition to the three daily train departures, there are two northbound and two southbound Indian Trails intercity bus departures and local bus service SMART (stopping on Woodward Avenue). The station is owned by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT), but the tracks are owned by the Canadian National Railway. Of the 22 Michigan stations served by Amtrak, Pontiac was the 16th-busiest in fiscal year 2015, boarding or detraining an average of approximately 43 passengers daily.  History  The ex-Grand Trunk station in 1978 Since August 1931 the Grand Trunk Western Railroad (GTWR, a subsidiary of the Canadian National Railway) provided commuter rail service from Pontiac to Detroit. By 1968 the railroad operated six daily commuter trains (three round-trips) between the two cities, with daily ridership averaging 2,812. When Amtrak took over passenger rail service in 1971, the GTWR service was not initially affected since the takeover did not include commuter rail. However, by that time the GTWR began posting losses on the service. On January 2, 1974 the Southeastern Michigan Transportation Authority (SEMTA) took over the GTWR trains and operated them as the Silver Streak. The aging depot turned over by the GTWR was located about to the northwest of the current Pontiac Transportation Center. The GTWR depot was situated east of the tracks on the northwest corner of West Huron Street and Woodward Avenue (known then as Wide Track Drive or Wide Track Circle). = Original building = The former transportation center building in 2002 Construction of the original Pontiac Transportation Center began in the late 1970s, funded by a US$3 million () loan from the MDOT, and the new facility was opened in May 1983, serving both buses and a commuter rail service to Detroit. The address provided by Amtrak for the facility was 1600 Wide Track Circle. The facility was a two-story building, with the first story constructed of scored concrete and the second of brick veneer. Original plans called for a restaurant to be built on the second floor. A small glass- covered pavilion was also built into the structure. Upon completion, the facility was initially served by SEMTA's Silver Streak, with service to Detroit (with the next eastbound stop being in Bloomfield Hills). Within six months of completion, however, the SEMTA commuter rail service was canceled, leaving the transportation center to serve only three buses a day. In addition, by 1985 structural deficiencies were already apparent, with interior surfaces showing water damage. In 1991, a pedestrian bridge between the transportation center and an office building across the street was opened, though it was closed within two years due to lack of use. Amtrak began serving the facility with its Wolverine service in 1994. In 2002, it was announced that the building was suffering from substandard construction, and city officials said that it should be demolished. In 2005, the city and the MDOT signed an agreement whereby the building would be transferred to the MDOT, which would take responsibility for demolishing it and constructing a replacement, and the construction loan, never paid back by the city, would be written off. In summer 2008, demolition began on the station building, with the skywalk to follow; the demolition project, estimated to cost $400,000, was to be completed by the end of the year. A temporary station was erected on site that served Amtrak customers for the next three years until the replacement transportation center was completed. = Replacement = Construction of the new (current) transportation center began on July 16, 2010, with an opening date just over year later on August 8, 2011. The opening ceremony was attended by US Representative Gary Peters and State Representative Tim Melton. The new facility had a total cost of US$1.4 million and was funded via Michigan's Comprehensive Transportation Fund. Unlike the former facility, which had been anticipated to be grand multi-use building, the new center was fairly simple and intended to address just the existing and new future transportation needs.

Website of the TagesspiegelAssembly room of the Sufi-Center Berlin History The Sufi Centre Rabbaniyya and the head of the Centre, Sheikh E≈üref Efendi belong to the Naqshbandi Sufi Order. The title of the Naqshbandi Sufi Order has changed throughout the centuries. According to the handed-down tradition of Sufi masters, the lineage of the Sufi order can be traced back to the Prophet Mohammed himself. Golden chain of the Naqshbandi Order The knowledge and the secrets of the Prophet Mohammed have been passed down throughout the centuries in an unbroken chain of 40 grandsheikhs (silsila) up until today. The wisdom and knowledge is embodied today by Grandsheikh Nazim al Rabbani. Grandsheikh Nazim Al Rabbani gave his student, E≈üref Goekcimen, the duty to give seekers in Germany, Bosnia and Turkey spiritual advice and to guide them in the Naqshbandi tradition. In 1994 a small group of people met up with Sheikh Esref Efendi in the Bellermanstrasse in Wedding to become the nucleus of the community. In 1998 after Bosnian War Sheikh Esref Efendi and some of his students went to Bosnia to offer humanitarian aid and assistance to people there. Subsequently, the group, which had grown to have approximately 40 members, travelled to Cyprus in 1999, to live there among the community of their Grandmaster, Maulana Sheikh Nazim el Rabbani. They stayed there for about six months until 2000. As they returned to Berlin the meetings initially took place in private residences, until the Sufi Centre Berlin opened its doors in the Reuterstrasse in Neukoelln in 2003. In 2008 the Centre moved to the Wissmannstrasse 20, also in Neukoelln. In October 2010 Grandsheikh Nazim declared the global solution, all believers shall unite as \\"servants of God\\", which is expressed in Arabic with the word \\"Rabbaniyya\\".Grandsheikh Nazim al Rabbani about Rabbaniyya. Video of the declaration of Grandsheikh Nazim al Rabbani. As a response to this declaration the Sufi Centre Berlin changed its name into Sufi Centre Rabbaniyya. After Nazim al Rabbani died in 2014, the group restructured in November 2014, closed the center in berlin, opened a new one in Cologne and moved to \\"sufiland\\" in Eigeltingen-Reute (Lake Constance), which was newly opened too.

There are small groups or individuals in all areas of Berlin who meet in private to pray or meditate together. Governing E≈üref Goekcimen was born in Mersin, Turkey, in 1964. Being a direct descendant of advisors to the Ottoman Sultans, he and his sisters and brother were raised by his parents in the tradition of Islamic beliefs. The family moved to Berlin in 1972. During his adolescence he frequently visited many libraries and mosques where he could study old works of religious literature. Sufi Master Sheikh Esref Efendi In 1995 he met the last Grandsheikh of the Naqshbandi silsila, Grandsheikh Nazim al Rabbani. He began to study Sheikh Nazim‚Äôs teachings and accepted him as his teacher and joined the Naqshbandiyya. The silsila (or golden chain) of the Naqshbandi tradition can be traced back through all grandsheikhs to Muhammed, who in Islam is regarded as the last and hence the seal of the prophets. Grandsheikh Nazim Al Rabbani is a descendant of the bloodline of Mohammed himself. He has authorized Sheikh E≈üref Efendi in 1996 to serve as a spiritual guide and advisor in the tradition of the Naqshbandi tariqa. As it is custom in the tradition, Sheikh E≈üref Efendi began delivering sohbets (spiritual addresses) in Berlin and quickly a community of people gathered around him. In 1998 he took off to Bosnia with some of his students to offer reconstructing and humanitarian aid after the war in Bosnia. In a joint effort they helped with the reconstruction of the burial site of Sari Saltuk (also known as Baba Sari Saltik or Saltuk Baba), a 13th-century saint. Today he is known as Sheikh E≈üref Efendi and founder of the Sufi Centre Berlin (Europ√§ische Mitte f√ºr interspirituelle Begegnungen = European Center for Inter-spiritual Encounters). He has also initiated the launch of Sufi Centres in Radolfzell/Bodensee (Lake Constance), Cologne, Eigeltingen/Reute and Ludwigshafen. His events and sohbets (spiritual addresses) are visited by people from all over Europe, people of various cultures, traditions and beliefs. Due to the growing interest Sheikh Esref Efendi‚Äôs influence has also spread to Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, France, Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Switzerland and Slovenia. Furthermore, he authored the books \\"Schl√ºssel zur Pforte der Sch√∂pfung‚Äú (keys to the gate of creation) and \\"Trinke aus der Quelle der Weisheit‚Äú (drink of the source of wisdom). He also conceptualized the Hayy-Kraft-Yoga. Sheikh E≈üref Efendi receives frequent invitations by various institutions and authorities to deliver speeches as a representative of Sufism and Islam due to his respectful attitude towards all religions, traditions and cultures. Sheikh Esref Efendi is regarded as a public figure and an authoritative representative of Islam and as such receives invitations throughout Germany and Europe to various events such as for example consular launch events or memorial services. Among others, he was invited to partake in the funeral and memorial service of Paul Spiegel, the late president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, which took place in 2006.thumb Since 2006 Sheikh E≈üref Efendi has been regularly invited to many different events of other spiritual schools of thought for the purpose of addressing the audience as a representative of Sufism and master of the Naqshibandi order.

Teachings =Sufism= Sufism can be found in Judaism, Christianity, Islam and in every heavenly religion. Sufism is the call of the divine love, which created an entire existence out of non-beingness. \\"Come‚Äú the divine love calls, \\"whoever you are!‚Äú (Jellaludin Rumi). Sufism is a spiritual path, which leads to divine love by practicing loving kindness towards others. Sufism is the essence, the seed of all religions. Sufism relates of this truth: As long as people do not love one another and do not accept each other as they are, they do not love God in a true sense. Because it was Him who created all people differently and individually. Sufism shows us the different stations leading to unity. There are four levels or stations: The first station is the understanding of the distinction between \\"me‚Äú and \\"you‚Äú. This means that the human at this station or level learns to understand his boundaries and the boundaries of others. The second level or station is the station of \\"yours is mine and mine is yours‚Äú. At this station the human learns that whatever he desires for himself he has to grant others and thus is cleansed from selfishness. The third station is the station of \\"neither mine nor thine‚Äú. This is the station where the Sufi learns that nothing is owned by humans, but everything comes from the Lord. The human is freed of the shackles of materialism and is raised to the station of angels. At the fourth station there is \\"neither me nor you‚Äú. If a human can be raised up to this level they lose any sense of duality. There is neither you nor me, but only He exists. Only the One and nothing else. All Prophets, from Adam to Moses, Jesus to Mohammed, they all came to raise humans unto these highest stations of divine love. (Excerpt of one of Sheikh E≈üref Efendi‚Äôs addresses).Newspaper article about Sufism written by Sheikh E≈üref Efendi , Website of the KGS magazine =Naqshibandyya= The followers of the Naqshibandyya tradition live within an Islamic framework of belief, i.e., they believe in the Torah of Moses and the Gospel of Jesus, as well as the Quran of Mohammed. Their life is directed by the example and the rules of the last messenger, Mohammed. The greatest distinction between Sufism and many other Islamic pathways is the practice of the quiet or loud dhikr. The continuous remembering of God can support the human soul in finding back to its origin and realizing its true value. The students of the Naqshibandi order believe in the prophecies of Prophet Mohammed. According to these prophecies, the current times are humanity‚Äôs last days or the days of Armageddon. At the height of these dark times they are expecting the appearance of a saviour, Imam Mahdi, and the second coming of Jesus.Newspaper interview with Sheikh E≈üref Efendi , Website of the Tattva Viveka magazine =Rabbaniyya= Rabbaniyya means \\"true servanthood\\". Rabbaniyya is the way to live as a servant of the creator. This is the essence, the seed of every spiritual path. The most important purpose of all religions is to lead humanity to the divine love and the art of true servanthood. Worship and practices =Sohbet= \\"Our path is the way of the sohbet (association)‚Äú said Shah Naqshband, the 12th grandsheikh of the Silsila. The tradition of the cleaning of the heart through the word of God and the breath of a Prophet or a Saint can be traced back to the Prophet Mohammed and all other Prophets of the Bible and the Torah, who have come before him. They all had the task to talk to humanity in parables about God and the soul as well as delivering messages, commandments and rules which would lead humanity onto a God-pleasing path and would ease their lives. Just like Jesus did, parables and metaphors are used for easy comprehension. In the Sufi Centre Berlin such sohbets take place at least once per week, usually on Fridays. The master Sheikh E≈üref Efendi or one of his authorized students speak at about 8pm. Such an address may generally last anything from 45‚Äì90 minutes, but there is no pre-set time limit. Sohbets are delivered without preparation and they offer that which is of benefit to all attendants. =Dhikr= Dhikr is the remembrance of God and is equivalent to chanting of mantras in other religions. Dhikr includes praises of God, recitations of his names, certain surahs of the Quran and remembrance of the Prophet.Dhikr in the Sufi Center Berlin. Dhikr-Video on youtube. Dhikr can be performed either quietly in a meditation style manner or loudly in a group with a dervish whirling in the middle or with Ha·∏çra. The Sheikh or an authorized student is leader of the dhikr. He determines the contents and the intensity of the chanting and the dancing. The Holy Scripture The exercise of Sufism is built upon the laws and rules that have been handed down through prophets and such following of a religious path can be found in every heavenly religion. Hence, the holy scriptures and sources of wisdom and insight for a Sufi are the Torah of Moses (Musa in Islam) as well as the true Gospel of Jesus (Isa in Islam) and the Quran of the Prophet Mohammed. Furthermore, there are the hadiths, which are traditions and sayings passed down from the Prophet Mohammed. They consist of Prophet Mohammed‚Äôs guidance, actions worthy to be followed, advice, approval of behaviour of others and especially information about forbidden actions and warnings of a moral-religious nature, which are not explicitly mentioned in the Quran. Considering that Mohammed is seen as the last Prophet sent by God and that the Quran embodies the revelation of the most complete and accomplished knowledge about creation of the earth and humanity, the most accomplished exercise of Sufism and its practices are bound by the life and the laws of the Prophet Mohammed and the religion of Islam. Current developments In 2006 students of Sheikh E≈üref Efendi received the authorization to guide the local communities of Eigeltingen/Reute near Lake Constance, Cologne and Ludwigshafen in the Naqshibandi tradition. They were authorized by Sheikh Esref Efendi to perform sohbets (addresses) and lead dhikrs. In 2009 Sheikh E≈üref Efendi was given a new task by grandsheikh Nazim and the Sufi Centre became the \\"Europaeische Mitte fuer interspirituelle Begenungen‚Äú (the Centre for Inter-spiritual Encounters). Since then the interspiritual and interfaith dialogue has been promoted even more. On many occasions representatives of other religions and traditions have been invited to facilitate talks about their own paths and visit with their students. Many German members of the community go on spiritual trips and pilgrimages to Islamic spiritual centres with Sheikh E≈üref Efendi and his longstanding students. For example, big groups have travelled to visit grandsheikh Nazim al Rabbani in Cyprus. There have also been trips to the holy places of Damascus, Bosnia and umrah and hajj pilgrimages to Mecca and Medina.Photos of travels of Sheikh E≈üref Efendi, his students and members of the community. Website of the Sufi Center Berlin. Organisation Der wahre Mensch e.V. ( The True Human, non-profit organization) In 2004 About 25 members of the Sufi community have founded the non-profit organization \\"Der wahre Mensch e.V.\\" In 2007 the organization received approval of the status of a charitable foundation. =Guiding principles= A \\"true human\\" is enabled to balance the spiritual and worldly aspects of himself and thus keep a harmonious equilibrium. According to the understanding of the Sufis this ability can be seen in how people control their lives within any given social structures on one hand and in inner peace and orientation towards universal truths on the other hand. Accordingly, they are working towards mutual tolerance and respect in society, they promote the idea of different cultures living together peacefully and in a considerate manner. Above all, they encourage respect for the laws of life regardless of faith or culture.Newspaper article about the participation of the Sufi Center Berlin at the Friedensfestival (Peace festival), Website of the Taz newspaper They regard their mission as giving hope to people who feel hopeless and in supporting people who are in need of help. They want to help those who have lost their way in finding orientation through lasting and sustainable values and they would like to give those who feel stable within their lives the opportunity to work on balancing and harmonizing society. =The purpose of the work= The members of the foundation have set following aims to their work: Alleviation of social hardship, integration work for different districts of town, improvement of the understanding of diverse cultures and ethnic groups amongst each other, encourage cultural exchange of different ethnic groups in society, conveyance of general values that reach beyond culture and religion, prevention of discrimination and facilitation of education through group activities. =Hierarchy= Directorship and the highest level of decision making power in regards to all matters relating to the Sufi Centre are held by Sheikh E≈üref Efendi. His students and several other members of the foundation take care of other areas such as being of assistance to the members of community, taking care of the youth, planning programmes, overseeing domestic matters such as the kitchen and catering, administration, support and advice, co-ordination and organization of general community matters and group trips. =Finance= All activities of the charitable foundation and the upkeep of the centre are financed by donations of members and guests. Travel and accommodation expenses are paid by each member themselves if they take part in a group excursion or trip. The organizers always attempt to keep the costs of such trips as low as possible as to make it more affordable for families, the elderly and the unemployed. =Publishing= The \\"New Ottomans Verlag‚Äú (New Ottomans Publisher) was founded in 2004 and collaborates with Spohr Verlag. They publish literature on Sufism and Islam as well as all works of Sheikh E≈üref Efendi (see literature). Various periodicals published articles about the spiritual path and the teachings of Sheikh E≈üref Efendi.German Article about \\"War and Peace in this world\\", written by Sheikh Esref Efendi . Website of the spiritual magazine \\"Sein\\" =Youth work= The foundation places special emphasis on offering meaningful spare time activities. A weekly address or speech is on offer for the youth. Young people are often given tasks to support the community, e.g., helping with house moves and other supporting activities. One major aim is the prevention of violence and drug abuse as well as the integration of young people with ethnic minority background. =Charitable activities= The Sufi Centre offers many services for free such as: spiritual counselling, individual meetings with authorized members, social support (e.g., ALG II, crisis support, mediation, psychological counselling (couple and family supervision and conflict solving), Sufi healing methods (e.g., natural health modalities,Shaykh Nazim: Buch der Heilung. Suggestions of Shaykh Nazim about natural health modalities, yoga, meditation, Sufi whirling), mutual support for renovations, house moves and family problems. =Interfaith dialogue= In 2009 Sheikh E≈üref Efendi was given a new task by Grandsheikh Nazim and the Sufi Centre became the \\"Europ√§ische Mitte fuer interspirituelle Begenungen‚Äú (the European Center for Interspiritual Encounters).

However, the Sufi perspective is totally different as they say that the Prophet Mohammed was welcomed with music by the people of Medina as he entered the town. When the question arose if the music shall stop, the Prophet answered that the people should celebrate happy times with music. The Sufis regard music as an expression of bliss in the divine presence. Also, some orthodox Muslims regard the following of a master/sheikh and the adoration of saints as shirk and therefore as a great sin.

The character was introduced in the season nine premiere episode, \\"Nice to Meet You, Walden Schmidt\\" to replace the character of Charlie Harper after actor Charlie Sheen was fired from the series. Walden was a main character throughout the show's final four seasons (seasons 9-12). He is listed on Forbes' fictional list of the top 15 richest characters as number 11, with a wealth of approximately $1.3 billion. Schmidt is introduced to the series as a billionaire internet entrepreneur who has recently been divorced and is now suicidal. After unsuccessfully attempting suicide, he turns up at Charlie Harper's beach house and decides to buy it from Charlie's brother, Alan, to whom Charlie has left the house in his will, after dying in France. Over the course of his duration on the series, Walden's personality greatly matured.  Character development  = Charlie Sheen's firing and replacement = For the first eight seasons of Two and a Half Men, the series' main character was Charlie Harper, portrayed by actor Charlie Sheen. In February 2011, after continued verbal attacks against series creator Chuck Lorre by Sheen, CBS announced that Two and a Half Men would suspend production for the rest of its eighth season. On March 7, CBS and Warner Bros. Television jointly announced that Sheen had been fired from Two and a Half Men, citing \\"moral turpitude\\" as a main cause of separation. = Creation of Walden Schmidt = In April 2011, Chuck Lorre announced that he had developed an idea for a Two and a Half Men reboot that would exclude Sheen and have Jon Cryer, who portrayed Alan Harper, in a lead role alongside a new character. On May 13, CBS announced that Ashton Kutcher would join the cast. Kutcher was quoted as saying, \\"I can't replace Charlie Sheen but I'm going to work my ass off to entertain the hell out of people!\\" Lorre was originally fixated on a character in his mid to late forties and originally approached Hugh Grant, who was fifty at the time. However, meeting 33-year-old Kutcher changed his mind. Lorre was quoted as saying \\"It got easy to let go once I met with Ashton. Because this was an opportunity to work with a pretty big talent, and it just became apparent to figure it out and let go of the old idea.\\" Jon Cryer stated in 2014 that \\"the writers didn't want to just do Kelso from 'That '70s Show,' because that's a criminal waste of Ashton's intelligence. He's actually a smart guy, so they tried to come up with a different take on a character for him, and it's been fun to watch him figure out who this guy is.\\"http://www.zap2it.com/blogs/two_half_men_jon_cryer_charlie_sheen_baggage-2014-11 Kutcher's first episode and the first appearance of Walden Schmidt was in the season nine premiere, \\"Nice to Meet You, Walden Schmidt\\", which aired on .  Character introduction  In the season nine premiere it is revealed that Charlie Harper has died in France and has left his beach house to his brother Alan. However, Alan has to put the house up for sale as he is unable to afford the mortgage payments and property tax. While Alan is speaking with Charlie's ashes and trying to decide where to spread them, Walden suddenly appears on the house's back deck, scaring Alan and causing him to drop the ashes on the living room floor. When Alan lets Walden in so he can use the telephone, Walden reveals he has just tried to commit suicide by drowning in the ocean. (Although he got out because the water was too cold.) He tells Alan that he is worth $1.3 billion, but would give it all up to reconcile with his wife Bridget, (portrayed by Judy Greer), from whom he had recently separated. Walden and Alan then proceed to bond at the local bar, where Walden tells Alan that he made his money when Microsoft purchased his website. At the end of the episode Walden tells Alan that he is going to buy the house. In the following episode, \\"People Who Love Peepholes\\", Alan moves out of the house to live with his mother, but his friendship with Walden strengthens and Walden lets Alan move back into the house.  Character traits  Walden's ex-wife describes him as \\"having the emotional maturity of a 12-year-old\\", and she, his housekeeper Berta and his ex-girlfriend Zoey have all described him as needy. However, he drives a Fisker Karma as he cares about the environment, and does not believe in lending money, as it is never repaid and leads to resentment of the person to whom the money is lent; instead he prefers to just give it away. He does not like the taste of alcohol and so does not drink much. Kutcher described him as \\"somewhere between an alien and Jesus Christ\\". When Walden first appears on the show he has long hair and a beard (resembling Jesus Christ according to Alan and Thor according to Evelyn), but in the season nine episode \\"A Possum on Chemo\\", he cuts his hair and shaves off the beard. Chuck Lorre explained this was done because \\"We wanted to tell a story about being in a relationship and being pressured to change...\\" Up until season 11's \\"Nangnangnangnang\\", Walden never referred to Charlie Harper by first name. He would refer to him as \\"your brother\\" (to Alan) or \\"Alan's brother\\" (to others). The character of Walden started the show as childish and someone who needed to be taken care of, and ended with him becoming an adult and being ready to take care of another, Louis.  Early life  Walden was born on July 12 (as stated in season 11), 1978 (as stated twice in season 10). He lived primarily with his mother Robin as his father, a magician, disappeared when he was very young. He was raised for the first four years of his life with a baby Gorilla named Magilla, (who he believed to be imaginary at the time) as his mother was a primatologist. In high school he met Bridget, who he would go on to marry. After flunking 8th grade, his mother had him evaluated, and the results were that the tests were too easy for him and he was bored.  Friendship with Alan Harper  When Walden met Alan Harper, the two almost instantly formed a friendship. Walden is very generous, which Alan uses to his advantage at times, such as when Alan's ex-wife Judith drops off their son Jake, and Alan convinces Walden to allow Jake to stay. Despite events such as this, Alan does demonstrate genuine concern for Walden. When Walden discovers that his imaginary childhood gorilla friend, \\"Magilla\\", was real, and was part of an experiment being conducted by his mother, he becomes very upset, as he thought of Magilla as a brother. Alan climbs a roof to console him, telling him that he knows what it's like to lose a brother. Walden knows that Alan is poor and has offered him money, but Alan refuses because he wants Walden to see him as a friend, rather than a freeloader. When Alan helps Walden keep control of his company \\"Walden loves Bridget Enterprises\\" after Bridget and his mother wrest control from him, Walden rewards Alan for being such a good friend by renaming the company \\"Walden loves Alan Enterprises\\" and by putting his name on the deed of the beach house. Later, when Alan suffers a mild heart attack, Walden insists on paying for his hospital bills, even when Alan fakes a second heart attack. When Zoey leaves Walden, Alan arranges an intervention by his mother, Berta and Walden's business partner, Billy Stanhope, to try to help him.  History on the show  Walden asks Evelyn to redecorate the beach house using solar power and wind power. The redecorated house included a voice-activated command to turn the lights on and off and get ice from the refrigerator, by the use of Walden's voice, but not Alan's. He begins dating con artist Courtney Leopold, whom Alan knows from the past, so he tries to warn Walden, but he doesn't listen, so Alan calls Bridget to convince Walden. He thinks this could be his chance at getting Bridget back, but she turns him down again. When he sees Bridget dating someone else again, he becomes jealous and tries to date a woman who looks like Bridget called Danny who happens to be a lesbian. When his old business partner Billy Stanhope returns wanting to create the \\"Electric Suitcase\\", Walden turns him down, still bitter about the viral video rants about him created by Billy. However, Alan manages to get them to agree with each other and become partners again. When creating the Electric Suitcase, Walden finds out that Billy is sleeping with Bridget. They successfully create the electric suitcase and begin work in a new office tower, where he later gives jobs to Jake and his friend Eldridge. He began dating a British woman named Zoey. Because of his childlike behavior, he is great with children like Zoey's daughter Ava. Zoey is the reason Walden cut his hair and shaved, as she wasn't fond of \\"the Jennifer Aniston hairdo\\"; this proved difficult for Walden as he loved his hair and beard but did it to prove how much Zoey meant to him. In the season 10 premiere, he proposes to Zoey, but she says no, leaving him confused. When he goes to confront her about it, she tells him that there is another man, which causes him to become depressed. Alan and Lyndsey try to set up some dates for Walden with some of Lyndsey's friends, but none of them go well. Later at Pavlovs bar, he meets Rose, who has been spying on Walden since he arrived at the house. When he tells Alan whom he bumped into, Alan warns Walden, but Walden interrupts and tells him she explained everything about what happened with Charlie and that when you're in love, it makes you do crazy things; however Alan knows she is lying. Walden later begins to see that Alan was right about her when she moves all of her things into the house after only mentioning staying. He goes to break up with her when Zoey reveals she would like to get back together, but Rose becomes enraged and orders her ferrets to attack him, even leaving them in his car to attack him, but instead attacks Alan. However Rose arrives at Zoey's apartment pretending to be pregnant, telling her that the baby is Walden's, so Zoey gets angry and breaks it off with Walden for good. He has grown tired of women wanting him just because of his money and so pretends to be poor by wearing some of Alan's clothes and using the pseudonym \\"Sam Wilson\\", pretending to be living in Alan's beach house with Alan as his billionaire landlord. Kate says Sam should leave the house and come live with her in her apartment; he agrees, eager to see where the relationship will go. Kate says he should find a job and so he goes out job hunting and finds a job selling Christmas trees. Kate works in a sewing store but her sewing machine breaks so Walden goes and buys her one; she wonders how he could have paid for it but is thrilled and asks Sam that there be no lies in the relationship. He gives Alan 100 thousand dollars to give to Kate to go to New York to get her fashion business going. However, when the strain of pretending to be someone he's not takes its toll on him, he tells her his real identity, but Kate gets mad and dumps him. On February 14, Walden is alone and depressed, but is overjoyed when Kate returns to him, but only to give him the money back he loaned her; she reveals that she has a new manager: Rose, who gets Kate away from Walden by flying her to China. Walden goes to a billionaires singles club in the hope of finding someone, however he sees Bridgit there and imagines what life would be like with her again so decides to ignore her. When Alan almost burns the house down, Walden gets mad and kicks him out. Eventually Walden begins to miss him and so asks Herb (whom Alan was staying with) if he had seen him, but a lonely Herb says no because he doesn't want to give him up. Eventually Alan makes up with Walden and goes back to him because he needed him more than Herb. However Walden asks Herb how he would feel about shared custody of Alan. Walden tries to cheer a lonely Herb up who is depressed about Judith leaving him, after Herb helps him in a medical emergency, and so tells him he has to party to forget her. However Walden and Alan cannot keep up with his partying and so ask him to leave after numerous days of non stop partying. However they become worried about him and so ask Judith to come and take him back. When Jake announces that he is going away to Japan for a year he asks Walden if he would like to come on a road trip with him and his dad. But Walden says he cannot as he has to see where his relationship with his girlfriend's grandmother goes. After Jake leaves to Japan for a year of military service, Alan's niece Jenny appears in the episode \\"Nangnangnangnang,\\" and Alan offers her a place to stay; Walden is not keen on this as he is tired of a Harper always taking domain in his house; he then changes his mind after finally warming up to Jenny, and realizing the Harpers are like family to him. After a former employee named Nicole (Odette Annable) forms a new software company in her garage with her assistant Barry (Clark Duke) she asks Walden to help her design it. They try to maintain a strictly platonic workplace relationship, but eventually reveal their feelings for one another. After successfully completing the software Nicole is offered a job at Google. She accepts leaving Walden devastated. However Barry agrees with Walden and would rather work with him, so turns up at his doorstep with his belongings and moves in with Walden, whom he idolizes and knows too much about. He and Alan are asked by Marty Pepper (Carl Reiner) to be his best men at his wedding to Evelyn, and to organize the stag party which ends in disaster. Rose continues to stalk him but he and she have sex when he believes his life to be in danger; they make up for all the wrongs they have done to each other in the past. His ex- girlfriend Kate returns from China wanting to \\"talk\\"; taking advice from Jenny and Barry, he goes to see her. They agree to go to dinner as \\"just friends\\" but later leave the restaurant to go home and have sex. The evening is ruined, however, by food poisoning. Walden believes Kate to be \\"the one\\" and tells Alan that he will propose to her. However, when a young woman named Vivian (Mila Kunis) arrives at the beach house, he falls for her while Kate is away due to her free spirited attitude and believes her to be \\"the one\\". He breaks up with Kate to find Vivian again, but she turns him down telling him to go back to his girlfriend. Depressed at losing two love interests he goes to his therapist who tells him to have casual encounters. As Alan's wedding ends in disaster, he and Alan have another talk on the couch, saying he wants Alan to continue living with him and to go back to the way things were when they moved in with each other three years ago, just two friends hanging out. Throughout the final season of the show Walden marries Alan in order for him to be able to adopt a child named Louis. Meanwhile, Alan and Walden both continue their relationships with women while refusing to be intimate with each other. Walden dates a single mother named Laurel while Alan implores getting back together with Lyndsey. After their social worker, Ms. McMartin (Maggie Lawson), who is overseeing Louis‚Äô adoption figures out Alan and Walden aren't gay, Alan tries to reason with her and they end up sleeping together. Alan begins seeing her and Lyndsey at the same time and breaks up with Ms. McMartin and remains with Lyndsey. Ms McMartin follows him and reveals herself while he and Lyndsey are on a date, prompting Lydnsey to break up with him as well. He reconciles with Lyndsey while Walden attempts to save the adoption by reasoning with McMartin himself and apologizing for Alan's actions. She becomes disheartened over the idea nobody cares about her like Walden cares for Louis and Walden comforts her but they end up sleeping together. Walden wants to get out of the relationship because he feels Ms. McMartin is unstable and it was unintended on his side but when they mutually break up over her realizing Walden doesn't really care for her and just wants the adoption to be final. Both Alan and Walden realize they made mistakes with Alan having chose Walden's house over being without Lyndsey and Walden dumping someone who is actually very similar to him. Alan proceeds to reunite with Lyndsey and propose to her which she accepts, while Walden serenades Ms. McMartin with Michael Bolton and they get back together into a real relationship. Both Alan and Walden agree to divorce and happily be with Lyndsey and Ms. McMartin respectively.  Romantic relationships  = Bridget = Walden first met Bridget in high school, where they fell in love and eventually got married. She met Walden when he wasn't a billionaire so her intentions were noble as she claims when talking to his girlfriend Zoey who met him when he was rich. She has a very good relationship with Walden's mother Robyn, which is proven when they team up to remove Walden as president of his company. She kicks him out of the house prior to the beginning of season 9, because he was too immature and relied on her more as a mother than a wife, which leaves him devastated, and causes him to attempt suicide. She has tried to reunite with Walden, but he began dating a woman named Zoey, so she began to get jealous and spy on him, where she meets a woman called Rose who agrees to take her under her wing as a trainee stalker. She began dating his friend Billy Stanhope. In the tenth season, Walden comes to the conclusion that getting back together with Bridget would be a bad idea; in the episode \\"Throgwarten Middle School Mysteries,\\" Walden fantasizes about getting back with Bridget, with the end result being her removing his testicles and putting them in a small chest, calling them hers. He then realizes (after imagining Alan lecturing him) that Bridget's controlling behavior was the reason that their relationship first failed. = Zoey = Zoey Hyde-Tottingham-Pierce is an English woman who began dating Walden after they met in a supermarket. She has a young daughter, Ava, who adores Walden. She, like many, does not like Alan and believes him to be taking advantage of Walden's good nature. She cares a great deal for Walden but can see his weaknesses. After refusing to say \\"I Love You\\" to Walden, (because she believes if she says it something will go wrong in the relationship) she finally does, making both of them happy. She sides with Walden when his mother and ex-wife try to take his company from him, to which they win, but is disappointed when he renames the company Walden Loves Alan Enterprises instead of Walden loves Zoey Enterprises. In season 10 Walden proposes to her but she turns him down because there is another man. He begins cutting out pictures of her and sticking them all over his bathroom walls and calls it \\"the Zoey room\\". When Ava invites him to her birthday party he gets her a huge dog, which annoys Zoey. The dog becomes a pain for her, but when she tries to return the dog to Walden she finds out that the dog has eaten his phone. They meet again in a restaurant where she is seeing another man, which makes Walden and Zoey insecure about seeing each other and so they leave. = Rose = Apparently, Rose continues to stalk the Harper family (regardless of Charlie's death) and Walden is a victim of circumstance. Walden meets Rose at Pavlov's bar, where she reveals to the audience that she had been spying on him. The two get along, and when Walden tells Alan, he tells him that she is trouble. However they begin to dating and Walden says that with Rose he is having the best sex he has ever had. However things get out of hand with her when she moves all her belongings into the house. When he reveals to her that Zoey wants to get back together with him she becomes angry and gets her ferrets to attack him, even leaving them in his car to attack him (although the ferrets end up attacking Alan instead). She goes to Zoey's and reveals that Walden got her pregnant, but this was just a lie. She is last seen stalking Walden through his window. When Walden's girlfriend after Rose, becomes a fashion model, Rose is revealed to be her agent who has sent her away to Japan to get her away from Walden so she can have him for herself. When Alan and Lyndsey are having an affair with each other one year after these events, her boyfriend hires an investigator to see who she is having an affair with. The investigator is Rose, who informs Walden that someone is trying to kill him, and so she takes him to a motel to hide with her. They apologize to each other for all the upset they may have caused each other and kiss and have sex. = Kate = Kate met Walden at Target, where he introduced himself as Sam Wilson, dressed in Alan's clothes and looking in the store as he was pretending to be poor to find someone who didn't just want him because of his money. \\"Sam\\" and Kate hit it off and begin to date. When she sees where Walden lives, he pretends Alan is his rich landlord, she takes a dislike to Alan and so asks \\"Sam\\" to move in with her. She asks him to find a job, so he goes out selling Christmas trees. For Christmas he gets her a sewing machine, even though Sam Wilson could never afford it, but Walden Schmidt could, she thanks him and says that there should be no lies. She cares for Sam in a great way and tries to be romantic, hanging a piece of broccoli as she didn't have any mistletoe. Walden donated $100,000 to Kate to start up a fashion design business but made her think Alan did it, though Alan tried to pull the stunt of only donating half of it and keeping the other half for himself. Kate then went to New York City to prepare a fashion show for her outfits. Weeks later, Sam Wilson came to New York to see Kate and finally revealed to her that his real name is Walden Schmidt and that he's really a billionaire. Kate was upset with him at first because he lied to her but forgave him shortly after realizing that he was really the one who donated that money, not Alan. He told her that they could talk about it when they get back to L.A. but she said that because of what he's done for her, she might now have a future in NYC. Walden realized that he really didn't think things through. Kate told Walden that they'd have to see what happens but Walden declared that he loved her. Kate said that it was Sam Wilson she loved but she wasn't sure about Walden Schmidt and told him that she needed time to process this big new information. Weeks later, Kate returned to L.A. on business with a check for $100,000 to pay Walden back because she's gotten a new business partner and investor. Walden begged Kate for another chance and they reconciled, trying to make their relationship work but their work schedules seemed to keep them apart. Walden said that their life together was so much easier when they were poor. Kate was last seen in a limousine, leaving for China with her new business partner and investor, who turned out to be Rose; Rose's real motive for becoming Kate's business partner is to keep Kate and Walden apart. Kate, unaware of Rose's history with Walden, told Rose that she's crazy about Walden. Rose said that she's been there. = Nicole = Nicole is a girl who used to work for Walden before he fired her. She bumps into him one day and tells him about an idea she has been working on. Walden is interested so they meet and after short negotiation they end up working together, now with Nicole as boss. From the beginning there is sexual tension all over the place but Nicole does not want to mix a relationship with work. But Walden is not used to receiving orders and after rejecting one ends up getting fired. Shortly afterwards he kisses Nicole and later asks her out to dinner. After hearing no from her he decides to set up a dinner in front of Nicole's garage where they work. After a bit of persuasion Nicole agrees on giving Walden another chance in the company. The tension is growing and after inventing a mind-reading tool, they finally end up in bed. After becoming increasingly paranoid that she was cheating on him after cancelling their dates, Walden and Barry follow her and find her talking to a man whom she reveals to be an employee at Google who offers her a job. Walden tries to convince her to stay and become Google, rather than just work for them. She decides to take the job offer stating that she and Walden were just having fun. = Alan = Walden and Alan pretend they are gay in season 12 which culminates in their marriage. There are many references to them being gay, such as Walden hugging Alan when he his completely naked, the two men hugging when the song I Will Always Love You plays. Other people believing they are gay e.g. a nurse at the hospital after Alan has a heart attack telling Walden to fill in the box life partner and saying \\"come out, come out wherever you are\\". A homosexual doctor at the hospital also thinks Walden is gay and says \\"That's why we gave up women, right buddy?\\" After Zoey starts complaining, the mailman thinks they are gay. Walden and Alan decided to turn gay in the season 10 premiere episode after Zoey leaves Walden. Walden squeezing Alan's butt while thinking of Zoey, and stroking his hair. Alan references the running joke when Walden wants to break up from Rose and Alan tells him to tell her that he is sick of hiding his feelings towards him (Alan). In season 10, however, he has now come to regret his decision in allowing Alan and Jake to live with him as he has grown tired of Alan taking advantage of his generosity and always dreams about the Harpers not living with him anymore. Despite this, a part of him still enjoys having them around and as he confesses in season 11, he considers the Harper clan (consisting of Alan, Jake, and Evelyn) to be a part of his family as they were there for him when he was down on his luck. Marty Pepper, Evelyn's boyfriend and eventual sixth husband believes Walden and Alan to be gay and arranges for them to be married by the minister who married him and Evelyn, seeing as he was there. The two men have a love rivalry with Jeff Probst who often taunts them about the number of women he has and the fact that he steals the women they are with. In season 12 episode 1 Walden proposes to Alan, and the two are married in a small civil ceremony in season 12 episode 2. They later become foster parents to Louis, played by Edan Alexander, though eventually Alan gets back with and proposes to Lyndsey while Walden begins a relationship with their social worker, Ms. McMartin (portrayed by Maggie Lawson), with whom Alan previously dated. = Other = * Judith Harper-Melnick.

Tom was born into a farming family in Donaghmore near Ashbourne on the County Meath-County Dublin border, and educated at St. Andrew's College, Dublin.Fuller, Bryony (1991) Tom Dreaper & His Horses, Punchestown/Marlborough In 1916, he left school to work on the family farm with his father and elder brother. However, the lure of steeplechasing proved irresistible and by the 1920s he was a successful point- to-point jockey. In 1930, his parents bought Greenogue, a 300-acre farm a few miles from Donaghmore, which Tom farmed himself, and in 1931 he took out a public licence.A licence to train racehorses, at that time issued by the Jockey Club His serious amateur career came to an end with a fall at Naas 1938, which left him in hospital for eight weeks, unconscious for two of them. Since he viewed himself primarily as a cattle-farmer, his training career was slow to take off. His first major success was with Prince Regent, who won the Irish Grand National in the winter of 1942, won the Cheltenham Gold Cup and was third in the Grand National in 1945 and fourth in the Grand National in 1946.Dreaper Racing: History In the following years, he cemented his reputation as Ireland's leading trainer with horses such as Storm Head, Hasty Bits, Shagreen and the great Fortria. However, his greatest successes came with the horses owned by Anne, Duchess of Westminster, a partnership which produced 97 wins, 43 second place and 33 third place finishes by horses such as Cashel View, Ben Stack, Sea Brief and the greatest of them all--Arkle. At one time he had in his stables both Arkle and Flyingbolt, the two highest- rated steeplechasers of all time. In all, he trained 26 winners at the Cheltenham Festival including the Cheltenham Gold Cup and the Arkle Challenge Trophy five times each and the Champion Chase six times. He won the Irish Grand National ten times, seven times consecutively (from 1960 to 1966). The only major race that he never won was the Grand National, coming second in 1970 with Vulture and in 1971 with Black Secret, ridden by his son Jim. Mr Dreaper's Irish Grand National winners were Prince Regent (1946), Shagreen (1949), Royal Approach (1954), Olympia (1960), Fortria (1961), Kerforo (1962), Last Link (1963), Arkle (1964), Splash (1965) and Flyingbolt (1966).

During the Golden Age of Dutch exploration and discovery (ca. 1590s‚Äì1720s), the Dutch were the first non-natives to undisputedly explore and chart coastlines of Australia, Tasmania, New Zealand, Tonga, Fiji, Samoa, and Easter Island. Polynesians reached nearly all the Pacific islands by about 1200 AD, followed by Asian navigation in Southeast Asia and West Pacific. Around the Middle Ages Muslim traders linked the Middle East and East Africa to the Asian Pacific coasts (to southern China and much of the Malay archipelago). The direct contact of European fleets with the Pacific began in 1512, with the Portuguese, on its western edges, followed by the Spanish discovery of the Pacific from the American coast. In 1513, six years before Magellan, Spanish explorer Vasco N√∫√±ez de Balboa crossed the Isthmus of Panama and saw the Pacific Ocean. In 1521 a Spanish expedition led by the Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan was the first known crossing of the Pacific Ocean, who then named it the \\"peaceful sea\\". Starting in 1565 with the voyage of Andres de Urdaneta and for the next 250 years, the Spanish controlled the transpacific trade with the Manila galleons that crossed from Mexico to the Philippines and vice versa, until 1815. Other expeditions from Mexico and Peru discovered various archipelagos in the North and South Pacific. In the 17th and 18th centuries, other European powers sent expeditions to the Pacific, namely the Dutch Republic, England, France, and Russia. Pre-European exploration Polynesian expansion Humans reached Australia by at least 40,000 BC which implies some degree of water crossing. People were in the Americas before 10,000 BC. One theory holds that they travelled along the coast by canoe. =Melanesians, Micronesians, Polynesians= About 3000 BC speakers of the Austronesian languages, probably on the island of Taiwan, mastered the art of long-distance canoe travel and spread themselves, or their languages, south to the Philippines and Indonesia and east to the islands of Micronesia and Melanesia. The Polynesians branched off and occupied Polynesia to the east. Dates and routes are uncertain, but they seem to have started from the Bismarck Archipelago, went west past Fiji to Samoa and Tonga about 1500 BC. By 100 AD they were in the Marquesas Islands and 300-800 AD in Tahiti (Tahiti is west of the Marquesas.) 300-800 AD is also given for their arrival at Easter Island, their easternmost point and the same date range for Hawaii, which is far to the north and distant from other islands. Far to the southwest, New Zealand was reached about 1250 AD. The Chatham Islands, about 500 miles east of New Zealand were reached about 1500. The fact that some Polynesians possessed the South American Sweet potato implies that they may have reached the Americas or, conversely, that people from the Americas may have reached Polynesia. Thor Heyerdahl's Kon-Tiki expedition successfully demonstrated that the trip from the Americas to Polynesia using only materials and technology available at the time was at least possible.Andrew Sharp, Ancient voyagers in Polynesia (Univ of California Press, 1964). =Asians= On the Asian side long-distance trade developed all along the coast from Mozambique to Japan. Trade, and therefore knowledge, extended to the Indonesian Islands but apparently not Australia. By at the latest 878 when there was a significant Islamic settlement in Canton much of this trade was controlled by Arabs or Muslims. In 219 BC Xu Fu sailed out into the Pacific searching for the elixir of immortality. Zheng He (1371‚Äì1433) was China‚Äôs greatest explorer, mariner, and navigator. Corona Brezina, Zheng He: China‚Äôs Greatest Explorer, Mariner, and Navigator (Rosen, 2016). Japanese fishing boats, if blown out to sea, could be carried by the current all the way to North America. Japanese boats reached Acapulco in 1617, the Aleutians in 1782, Alaska in 1805, the mouth of the Columbia River in 1820, and Cape Flattery in 1833. Such trips may have taken place before Europeans were present in those areas to make detailed records of them.Hayes, Derek. Historical Atlas of the North Pacific, page 52 European exploration =Iberian pioneers= The first contact of European navigators with the western edge of the Pacific Ocean was made by the Portuguese expeditions of Ant√≥nio de Abreu and Francisco Serr√£o, via the Lesser Sunda Islands, to the Maluku Islands, in 1512,Hannard (1991), page 7 and with Jorge √Ålvares's expedition to southern China in 1513,Porter, Jonathan.

Spanish explorer Balboa was the first European to sight the Pacific from America in 1513 after his expedition crossed the Isthmus of Panama and reached a new ocean. He named it Mar del Sur (literally, \\"Sea of the South\\" or \\"South Sea\\") because the ocean was to the south of the coast of the isthmus where he first observed the Pacific. Later, Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan sailed the Pacific East to West on a Castilian (Spanish) expedition of world circumnavigation starting in 1519. Magellan called the ocean Pac√≠fico (or \\"Pacific\\" meaning, \\"peaceful\\") because, after sailing through the stormy seas off Cape Horn, the expedition found calm waters. The ocean was often called the Sea of Magellan in his honor until the eighteenth century.Camino, Mercedes Maroto. Producing the Pacific: Maps and Narratives of Spanish Exploration (1567‚Äì1606), p.76. 2005. From 1565 to 1815, a Spanish transpacific route known as the Manila galleons regularly crossed from Mexico to the Philippines and back. On the Asian side the Portuguese and later the Dutch built a regular trade from the East Indies to Japan. On the American side Spanish power stretched thousands of miles from Mexico to Chile. The vast central Pacific was visited only by the Manila galleons and an occasional explorer. The south Pacific was first crossed by Spanish expeditions in the 16th century who discovered many islands including Tuvalu, the Marquesas, the Cook Islands, the Solomon Islands, and the Admiralty Islands, and later the Pitcairn and Vanuatu archipelagos. Spanish explorations and routes across the Pacific Ocean.  The Pacific recognized  Europeans knew that there was a vast ocean to the west, and the Chinese knew that there was one to the east. Learned Europeans thought that the world was round and that the two oceans were one. In 1492 Columbus sailed west to what he thought was Asia. When Pedro √Ålvares Cabral, en route to Asia via the Atlantic and the Indian oceans, reached Brazil, in 1500, the true extent of the Americas began to become known. The Martin Waldseem√ºller map of 1507 was the first to show the Americas separating two distinct oceans. This guess was confirmed in 1513 when Balboa crossed Panama and found salt water. The Magellan expedition of 1519-22 proved that there was one continuous ocean from the Americas to Asia. The Diogo Ribeiro map of 1529 was the first to show the Pacific at about its proper size.  The coast of Asia  The Portuguese reached India in 1498, conquered Malacca in 1511 and in 1512 Ant√≥nio de Abreu and Francisco Serr√£o reached the Spice Islands. In May 1513 Jorge √Ålvares reached southern China and in the same year Balboa crossed Panama. In 1525 Diogo da Rocha and Gomes de Sequeira reached the Caroline Islands, and Jorge de Menezes in 1526-27 landed on the Islands of Don Jorge de Menezes, in the northwest coast of New Guinea (now part of Indonesia), and named the region Ilhas dos Papuas and is thus credited with the European discovery of Papua. In 1542 Fern√£o Mendes Pinto reached Japan. From about 1543 until 1614, the Portuguese monopolize the trade between China and Japan, through the nanban trade. In 1589, Jo√£o da Gama reached Hokkaido and possibly sighted the Kuril islands, crossing the Pacific further north of the routes usually taken until then. The land that he eventually discovered northeast of Japan, has since become a matter of legend and controversy. One hundred years after the Spanish and Portuguese the Dutch Republic began its remarkable expansion. The Dutch reached the East Indies in 1596, the Spice Islands in 1602 and in 1619 founded Batavia. In 1600 a Dutch fleet reached Japan from the Strait of Magellan. The Dutch had little success in China but established themselves at Hirado, Nagasaki in 1609 and monopolized the Japan trade from 1639. In 1639 Matthijs Quast and Abel Tasman searched the empty ocean east of Japan looking for two islands called 'Rica de Oro' and 'Rica de Plata'. In 1643 Maarten Gerritsz Vries reached and charted Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands. In 1653 Hendrick Hamel was shipwrecked in Korea. At about this time the Russians reached the Pacific overland via Siberia (see below). It is significant that the Russian and Dutch trades were never linked since Siberian furs might easily have been exported to China at great profit. Portuguese trade routes (blue) and Spanish trade routes (white) in the 16th century.  Magellan and the Manila Galleons  In 1519 Ferdinand Magellan sailed down the east coast of South America, found and sailed through the strait that bears his name and on 28 November 1520 entered the Pacific. He then sailed north and caught the trade winds which carried him across the Pacific to the Philippines where he was killed. One surviving ship returned west across the Indian Ocean and the other went north in the hope of finding the westerlies and reaching Mexico. Unable to find the right winds, it was forced to return to the East Indies. In 1565 (44 years later) Andr√©s de Urdaneta found a wind system that would reliably blow a ship eastward back to the Americas. From then until 1815 the annual Manila Galleons crossed the Pacific from Mexico to the Philippines and back, exchanging Mexican silver for spices and porcelain. Until the time of Captain Cook these were the only large ships to regularly cross the Pacific. The route was purely commercial and there was no exploration of the areas to the north and south. In 1668 the Spanish founded a colony on Guam as a resting place for west-bound galleons. For a long time this was the only non-coastal European settlement in the Pacific.  South America  In 1513, six years before Magellan, Spanish explorer Vasco N√∫√±ez de Balboa crossed the Isthmus of Panama and saw the Pacific Ocean. In 1517-18 two ships were built on the Pacific coast. In 1522 Pascual de Andagoya sailed the coast as far as Ecuador. In 1532 Francisco Pizarro conquered Peru. A regular trade developed that carried Peruvian silver up the coast to Panama where it was carried overland to the Caribbean and part to Spain. Spanish settlement extended as far south as central Chile. In 1557-8 Juan Fern√°ndez Ladrillero discovered the Juan Fernandez islands and explored the Chilean coast down to the Strait of Magellan. Western Islands reached from South America \\"A New and Accurate Map of the World\\" of 1627 possibly by John Speed. Western North America north of Mexico a guess; A Strait of Anian at Bering Strait; Japan and other Pacific Islands distorted; Only the north coast of New Guinea; No Australia; Huge 'Southern Unknowne Land' in the south.  The South Pacific  Several Spanish expeditions were sent from South America across the Pacific Ocean in the 16th and early 17th centuries. They all used the southern trade winds. In 1567/68 √Ålvaro de Menda√±a de Neira sailed from Peru to the Solomon Islands. In 1595 he tried again and reached the Santa Cruz Islands (eastern Solomons toward Fiji). He died there and the survivors reached the Philippines. In 1606 Pedro Fernandes de Queir√≥s reached Vanuatu south of the Solomons. He continued exploring and eventually sailed back to Mexico. One of his separated ships under Luis Vaz de Torres sailed west and discovered the strait that bears his name sighting the northern tip of Australia. Other Spanish expeditions discovered Tuvalu, the Marquesas, the Cook Islands, the Admiralty Islands and the Pitcairn. In 1722 the Dutchman Jacob Roggeveen sailed from Cape Horn to Batavia and discovered Easter Island and Samoa.  Cape Horn  Six years after Magellan, in 1526, one of the ships of the Loa√≠sa Expedition sailed through the Strait of Magellan and followed the coast north to Mexico. In 1578 Francis Drake passed through the Strait, sailed north raiding Spanish ships. On 5 June 1579, the ship briefly made first landfall at South Cove, Cape Arago, just south of Coos Bay, Oregon, and then sailed south while searching for a suitable harbour to repair his ailing ship. On 17 June, Drake and his crew found a protected cove when they landed on the Pacific coast of what is now Northern California. While ashore, he claimed the area for Queen Elizabeth I as Nova Albion or New Albion. In 1580 Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa, who was hunting for Drake, was the first to sail from the Strait to Europe. In 1587 Thomas Cavendish followed Drake, captured a Manila galleon and returned via the Indian Ocean. In 1599 the first Dutch ships passed through the Strait of Magellan (Will Adams, the first Englishman to reach Japan, was on board). Olivier van Noort followed and became the first Dutch circumnavigator. In 1525 Francisco de Hoces, while trying to enter the Strait as part of the Loaisa Expedition, was blown south by a storm and saw what he thought was land's end. In 1578 Drake was blown south on the west side and saw what he thought was open water. In 1616 Willem Schouten sought a more southerly passage and rounded Cape Horn. In 1619 the Garcia de Nodal expedition followed the Dutch and proved that Tierra del Fuego was an island by circumnavigating it. Since the Strait of Magellan is narrow and hard to navigate Cape Horn became the standard route until the opening of the Panama Canal. It is a measure of the difficulty of these seas that it was not until 1820 that anyone went as far south as Antarctica.  North America  When the Spanish conquered Mexico in 1521 they gained a stretch of Pacific coast. In 1533, Fort√∫n Xim√©nez reached Baja California and in 1539 Francisco de Ulloa showed that it was a peninsula, but the myth of an Island of California continued for many years. In 1542 Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo reached a point north of San Francisco. In 1578 Drake landed somewhere on the coast. In 1587 Pedro de Unamuno, coming from the Philippines, stopped at Morro Bay, California. In 1592, Juan de Fuca may have reached Puget Sound. In 1595, Sebastian Rodriguez Cerme√±o (Sebasti√£o Rodrigues Soromenho), commander of the Manila galleon San Agust√≠n, attempted an exploration of the California coast. He reached the continent between Point St. George and Trinidad Head in California, but the galleon was later wrecked in a storm off Drake's Bay and the survivors had to sail the rest of the way back to Mexico in a small launch. The smaller vessel, however, allowed Cerme√±o to sail closer to the coast and to make useful observations of coastal features. In 1602, Sebasti√°n Vizca√≠no re-explored the California coast, one of his ships reaching Oregon. His was the last northward exploration for the next 150 years. The Portol√† expedition of 1769 began the land exploration of Alta California, following the coast as far north as San Francisco Bay and using the reports of Cerme√±o and Vizca√≠no for guidance. After conquering Mexico the Spanish occupied the southern two thirds of Mexico, all of Central America and the South American coast down to Chile. North of this the land was too dry to support a dense population that could be ruled and taxed. The only exception was the Pueblo peoples far to the north in New Mexico. People like Francisco V√°squez de Coronado penetrated far into the interior and found nothing that the Spanish valued. The Chichimeca country of northern Mexico was slowly absorbed and Baja California began to be settled in 1687. The returning Manila galleons followed the westerlies to the coast of California, but immediately turned south, making only a few attempts to explore the coast. For more see History of the West Coast of North America and Early knowledge of the Pacific Northwest. =Golden Age of Dutch exploration and discovery (c. 1590s‚Äì1720s)= Golden Age of Netherlandish cartography. Australasia during the Golden Age of Dutch exploration and discovery (ca. 1590s‚Äì1720s): including Nova Guinea (New Guinea), Nova Hollandia (mainland Australia), Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania), and Nova Zeelandia (New Zealand). The Dutch were the first non-natives to undisputedly explore and chart coastlines of Australia, Tasmania, New Zealand, Tonga, Fiji, Samoa, and Easter Island.  Australia and the southwest  Australia is remarkable for the number of explorers who missed it. There seems to be no record of Indonesian sailors reaching Australia. Some think that the Portuguese reached Australia before 1600 but these theories are difficult to prove. The 1567‚Äì1606 Spanish voyages from South America stopped at islands to the east before reaching Australia. The first European to definitely see Australia was Willem Janszoon who in February 1606 reached the Cape York Peninsula and thought it was part of New Guinea. Also in 1606 (June to October) Luis V√°ez de Torres of the Quiros expedition from South America followed the south coast of New Guinea and passed through the Torres Strait without recognizing Australia. His voyage, and therefore the separation between Australia and New Guinea, was not generally known until 1765. From about 1611 the standard Dutch route to the East Indies was to follow the roaring forties as far east as possible and then turn sharply north to Batavia. Since it was difficult to know longitude some ships would reach the west coast or be wrecked on it. 1616 Dirk Hartog bumped into the west coast and did some exploring. Frederick de Houtman did the same in 1619. In 1623 Jan Carstenszoon followed the south coast of New Guinea, missed Torres Strait and went along the north coast of Australia. In 1643 Abel Tasman left Mauritius, missed Australia, found Tasmania, continued east and found New Zealand, missed the strait between the north and south islands, turned northwest, missed Australia again and sailed along the north coast of New Guinea. In 1644 he followed the south coast of New Guinea, missed the Torres Strait, turned south and mapped the north coast of Australia. In 1688 the English buccaneer William Dampier beached a ship on the northwest coast. In 1696 Willem de Vlamingh explored the southwest coast. In 1699 Dampier was sent to find the east coast of Australia. He sailed along the west coast, went north to Timor, followed the north coast of New Guinea to the Bismarck Archipelago and abandoned his search because his ship had become rotten. Until Captain Cook the east coast was completely unknown and New Zealand had only been seen once. Major Islands. Off the map to the east of the Cook Islands are the Society Islands with Tahiti and then the Tuamoto Archipelago with the Marquesas to its north.

Broughton  Mythical Lands  Europeans had long believed in a Strait of Anian somewhere near Bering Strait. A large and distorted Hokkaido was called 'Ezo', 'Jesso' and many other spellings. One of the Kuril Islands named \\"Companies Landt\\" by Vries grew into a large mass attached to North America. Joao-da- Gama-Land was thought to be east of Japan. There was an overgrown Puget Sound called \\"Grande Mer de l'Ouest\\" possibly connected to Hudson Bay. In the far south was a Terra Australis. The map published in Diderot's Encyclop√©die in 1755 is filled with nonsense. In 1875 no less than 123 mythical islands were removed from the Royal Navy chart of the North Pacific. =Further expeditions= Russian posts closely followed the natural distribution of the fur-bearing Sea Otter  Alaska and the Russians  The modern period begins with Russian expeditions. They crossed Siberia and reached the Pacific in 1639 (Ivan Moskvitin). In 1644 Vassili Poyarkov found the Amur River. In 1648 Semyon Dezhnyov (probably) entered the Pacific from the Arctic Ocean. In 1652 Mikhail Stadukhin followed the coast of the Sea of Okhotsk. In 1697 Vladimir Atlasov entered the Kamchatka Peninsula overland from the north. In 1716 the first seagoing boats were built to reach Kamchatka from the mainland. In 1728 Vitus Bering sailed from Kamchatka through the strait that bears his name without seeing America. In 1732 Mikhail Gvozdev and Ivan Fedorov (navigator) saw the tip of Alaska from the Bering Strait. In 1741 Vitus Bering and Alexei Chirikov sailed just south of the Aleutian Islands and reached the Alaska panhandle. Peter Kuzmich Krenitzin mapped the Aleutians before 1769. The myth of a land mass north of the Aleutians took a long time to dispel. Russians fur hunters island-hopped along the Aleutians and then along the south coast of Alaska looking mainly for sea otter (Attu at the west end of the Aleutians in 1745, Unalaska Island at the east end in 1759, Kodiak Island 1784, Kenai Peninsula 1785, Yakutat, 1795, Sitka 1799, Fort Ross 1812). North of the Aleutians posts appeared on the west coast after 1819. Spaniards from Mexico met the Russians in 1788. (see below). Russian America was sold to the United States in 1867. The routes of Captain James Cook's voyages. The first voyage is shown in red, second voyage in green, and third voyage in blue. The route of Cook's crew following his death is shown as a dashed blue line.  Captain Cook  On his first voyage (1768‚Äì1771) James Cook went to Tahiti from Cape Horn, circumnavigated New Zealand, followed the east coast of Australia for the first time and returned via the Torres Strait and the Cape of Good Hope. On his second voyage (1772‚Äì1775) he sailed from west to east keeping as far south as possible and showed that there was probably no Terra Australis. On his third voyage (1776‚Äì1780) he found the Hawaiian Islands and followed the North American coast from Oregon to the Bering Strait, mapping this coast for the first time and showing that there was probably no Northwest Passage. Cook was killed in Hawaii in 1779. The expedition made a second attempt at the Bering Strait, stopped at Kamchatka and China and reached England in 1780. Cook set a high standard of scientific exploration, showed that there was no large land mass in the southern ocean, mapped the two largest island groups in the Pacific and by following the east coast of Australia and the west coast of North America closed the last gaps in European knowledge of the Pacific coasts. After Cook everything was detail.  Cook's rivals and successors  Several governments sponsored Pacific expeditions, often in rivalry or emulation of Captain Cook. At the time of Cook's first voyage, in 1766-1769 Louis Antoine de Bougainville crossed the Pacific and publicized Tahiti and in 1767 Samuel Wallis and Philip Carteret separately crossed the Pacific. In 1785-1788 Jean-Fran√ßois de Galaup, comte de Lap√©rouse followed the American coast from Chile to Alaska, crossed to China, explored northern Japan and Kamchatka, went south to Australia and lost his life in the Santa Cruz Islands. The Malaspina Expedition (1789‚Äì1794) visited the American coast, Manila, New Zealand and Australia. In 1792-93 George Vancouver more thoroughly mapped the west coast of Canada. In 1803/6 Adam Johann von Krusenstern led the first Russian circumnavigation and investigated both sides of the North Pacific. In 1820 Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen saw Antarctica. A number of other voyages are listed in \\"European and American voyages of scientific exploration.\\"  Spain on the west coast of North America  For Europeans in the Age of Exploration western North America was one of the most distant places on Earth (9 to 12 months of sailing). Spain had long claimed the entire west coast of the Americas. The area north of Mexico however was given little attention in the early years. This changed when the Russians appeared in Alaska. The Spanish moved north to California and built a series of missions along the Pacific coast including: San Diego in 1767, Monterey, California in 1770 and San Francisco in 1776. San Francisco Bay was discovered in 1769 by Gaspar de Portol√† from the landward side because its mouth is not obvious from the sea. The Spanish settlement of San Francisco remained the northern limit of land occupation. By sea, from 1774 to 1793 the Spanish expeditions to the Pacific Northwest tried to assert Spanish claims against the Russians and British. In 1774 Juan Jos√© P√©rez Hern√°ndez reached what is now the south end of the Alaska panhandle. In 1778 Captain Cook sailed the west coast and spent a month at Nootka Sound on Vancouver Island. An expedition led by Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra sailed north to Nootka and reached Prince William Sound. In 1788 Esteban Jos√© Mart√≠nez went north and met the Russians for the first time (Unalaska and Kodiak Island) and heard that the Russians were planning to occupy Nootka Sound. In 1789 Martinez went north to build a fort at Nootka and found British and American merchant ships already there. He seized a British ship which led to the Nootka Crisis and Spanish recognition of non-Spanish trade on the northwest coast. In 1791 the Malaspina expedition mapped the Alaska coast. In 1792 Dionisio Alcal√° Galiano circumnavigated Vancouver Island. In 1792-93 George Vancouver also mapped the complex coast of British Columbia. Vancouver Island was originally named Quadra's and Vancouver's Island in commemoration of the friendly negotiations held by the Spanish commander of the Nootka Sound settlement, Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra and British naval captain George Vancouver in Nootka Sound in 1792. In 1793 Alexander Mackenzie reached the Pacific overland from Canada. By this time Spain was becoming involved in the French wars and increasingly unable to assert its claims on the Pacific coast. In 1804 the Lewis and Clark expedition reached the Pacific overland from the Mississippi River. By the Adams‚ÄìOn√≠s Treaty of 1819 Spain gave up its claims north of California. Canadian fur traders, and later a smaller number of Americans, crossed the mountains and built posts on the coast. In 1846 the Oregon Treaty divided the Oregon country between Britain and the United States. The United States conquered California in 1848 and purchased Alaska in 1867.  Northeast  The Russians moved south and the Japanese moved north and explored the Kuril Islands and Sakhalin. About 1805 Adam Johann von Krusenstern was apparently the first Russian to reach eastern Siberia by sea from European Russia. In 1808 Mamiya Rinzo explored the coast of Sakhalin. During the Crimean War a British fleet failed to capture Petropavlovsk- Kamchatsky. In 1860 Russia annexed the southeast corner of Siberia from China.  The Pacific opened to trade and imperialism  After Captain Cook large numbers of European merchant vessels began to enter the Pacific. The reasons for this are not completely clear. On Cook's third voyage furs bought at Nootka were sold in China at a 1,800 percent profit - enough to pay for a trading voyage. The first to do this was James Hanna from Macao in 1785. Robert Gray in 1787 was the first American. This Maritime fur trade reached its peak about 1810, drew many ships into the Pacific and drew Canadians and Americans to the coast. The first Pacific whaling ship left London in 1788 and by the nineteenth century there were hundreds of whaleships in the Pacific each year. Clipper ships cut the sailing time from Europe to the Pacific. England founded a colony in Australia in 1788 and New Zealand in 1840. After about 1800 England began to replace the Dutch Republic along the Asian coast. Hong Kong became a colony in 1839 during the First Opium War, which was also the first time that a large European military and naval force appeared in the Pacific. European ships and sailors disrupted life on the Pacific islands. Most of the Pacific islands were soon claimed by one European power or another.

Description This artwork is composed of two limestone elements, each being hand-carved by the artist. The upper element is a three-sided openwork triangular that sits on the second element, a cylindrical pedestal. The top form looks twisted as it loops over the open space like a handle. The bottom part of the ‚Äúhandle‚Äù which contacts the pedestal is flattened out into an oval. The artwork is carved out of a very porous and stratified Indiana limestone. The colors range from mute grays to browns. Historical information In 1981 Rodgers was chosen to create Memories of Prague as a memorial to Louisa K. Valentine. Valentine was born in Prague but moved to escape the war in 1945. She met her husband, Joseph Valentine, while he was stationed overseas, and when the war was over they moved to the Indiana. Mrs. Valentine loved the Indianapolis Museum of art, volunteering regularly. In 1978 she died, and in her honor her family commissioned an artwork that was to be displayed in the IMA's collection. The specifications were for the artist to be a Hoosier, it was to be made from Indiana limestone, and the title must have to do with Prague. When Rodgers was selected to make the artwork, he was faculty member of the Interior Design Program at IU of Pennsylvania in Indiana, Penn. He communicated directly with Robert Yassin during the planning stages of the commission. In 1981 Rodgers was hoping to make a sundial, but the design had to be scrapped because the funds provided were not enough to cover the complexities involved in the construction of such an object. A few years later his dream of making a sundial became possible with a large commission by Crown Hill Cemetery as the Equatorial Sundial. For the Valentine commission, Rodgers ended up carving a Mobius strip-styled arch which recalled the arched doorways and bridges common in Prague. According to Rodgers, ‚Äúthe Valentine Memorial emerged as an expression of continuity and fulfillment as those of involved in it attempted to grasp the understanding that death completes life and that we as survivors retain within us something of the essence of the people with whom we spend our lives. The creation of a memorial provides the occasion for people to join together, if they choose to, to begin a search for an expression that will in the end be a celebration of many distilled remembrances, which are the essence of intimate contact.‚Äù =Location history= The artwork has been on constant view at the top of the landing of the outdoor amphitheater since 1985. =Acquisition= Memories of Prague was received at the IMA in May 1985. It was accessioned the same year, and in November the artwork was given a dedication ceremony, also in honor of Mrs. Valentine. Artist Rodgers is an Indiana native who went to IU to become an astronomer. Partway through earning his degree, he switched to art (painting) and it wasn't until he was in graduate school that he set his mind on becoming a sculptor. In 1968 Rodgers earned his MFA, and he then moved to New Mexico to teach art. In 1971 he returned to Indiana, teaching stone-carving workshops including a class at Bedford-North Lawrence High School. Throughout his career, he designed, created, installed, and otherwise assisted in the making of site specific artworks. He has taught at many universities in the United States, and was faculty at Valdosta State University until 2008. See also * List of Indianapolis Museum of Art artworks * Save Outdoor Sculpture!

Built in 1980 by Crown American, the mall originally featured Kmart, Hess's, and Sears as its anchor stores; later additions to the mall included Pomeroy's (which was later bought out by The Bon-Ton) and Phar-Mor. In its day, it was one of the largest shopping malls in Pennsylvania. After losing a large number of tenants throughout the 2000s and 2010s the mall had become increasingly vacant, and as of 2017, had only Dunham's Sports as a major anchor tenant, which closed December 31, 2017 and later relocated and opened at Pottsville's Fairlane Village Mall on December 7, 2018. The last tenant to close in the mall was Pearl Stadium 8 Theatres, which closed January 15, 2018. The property is owned by Northpoint Development, who bought it out of Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2017. The mall's demolition began on January 31, 2018 and was reportedly completed by September 5, 2018. In place of the former mall, an industrial warehouse called Clayco was built. History Crown American, a shopping center development company based in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, opened Schuylkill Mall on October 9, 1980. The mall was built at the junction of Pennsylvania Route 61 and Interstate 81. It originally had three anchor stores: Kmart, Hess's, and Sears. The mall featured room for 115 stores, including a prototype McCrory variety store. 91 of the 115 storefronts were open at the time, including a Rea & Derick drugstore, a Weis Markets grocery store on an outparcel, and two McDonald's restaurants: one inside the mall, and a second in the parking lot. The Sears store replaced a store that had been operational in nearby Pottsville since 1930, and featured three times the square footage of that location; Hess's was built as a store-within-a-store concept with a large furniture section; and the Kmart featured a home improvement section, which many Kmart stores at the time did not contain. Originally, mall developers had been in negotiations for J. C. Penney as a fourth anchor. In 1983, Pomeroy's department store also relocated from downtown Pottsville to become the mall's fourth anchor. Only four years later, the Pomeroy's chain was sold to The Bon-Ton. The fifth anchor, Phar-Mor, opened in 1991. As part of a store renovation in 1995, Sears added by taking over vacated sections of mall space. Also in 1995, Hess's closed its store at the mall; three years later, it became an outlet store called U.S. Factory Outlets. Rex TV & Appliance joined the mall in 1998 as well. After U.S. Factory Outlets closed, it became the original location of Black Diamond Antiques, which later moved to the Phar-Mor building after that chain went out of business in 2002. The former Hess's building then became a Steve & Barry's in October 2007; after Steve & Barry's went out of business in 2009, it then became a discount clothing store called Famous Labels, which closed in May 2011. In November 2011, Dunham's Sports signed a lease to open a store at the mall. The store opened in the former Phar-Mor building, resulting in Black Diamond Antiques moving back to the former Hess's/Steve & Barry's/Famous Labels space. Dunham's opened in September 2012. Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust (PREIT), who acquired the Crown American portfolio in 2003, sold the mall to Empire Realty in 2007. The Mall was listed to be sold as sale number 59 of the Schuylkill County Sheriff's Sale on June 17, 2016 in judgement of $27,428,876.10. Sale of the mall was completed in March 2017 to Northpoint Development LLC of Riverside, Missouri for $2.1 million, who also assumed the leases to most of the retail spaces around the mall. On May 9, 2017, stores were given 90 days notice to vacate the mall. The mall closed officially on January 15, 2018. Demolition of the mall was completed on September 5, 2018 and an industrial warehouse called Clayco was built to replace it. Closures When in existence, many of the mall's stores closed throughout the 2000s. In 2009, Chick-fil-A closed its location at the mall, while a fitness center opened in a space previously occupied by Jo-Ann Fabrics, and a screen printing store replaced a former KB Toys. Gap, an original tenant, closed in early 2012. The mall's Arby's abruptly closed in July 2014 when its franchiser declared bankruptcy. A month later, GameStop and a cigar shop closed as well. A consignment shop called Mustard Seed opened at the mall in 2013. The space was previously occupied by a Rex electronics store. The mall had two arcades which have also closed. One \\"Gamers Alley\\" sometime in 2014, and one in 2011 to make way for the new movie theater expansion project. The arcade was located next to the old movie theater, which is now the new lobby and concession stand for the movie theater. Hallmark Gold Crown Last day of business was on Feb. 22 2014. The store had been in the mall since the mall opened in October 1980 Schuylkill Valley Sports: Closed sometime in the beginning of 2014 due to lack of business and foot traffic in the mall. The Frackville store opened in 1990, it was formally located where Gertrude Hawk Chocolates is now. Littman Jewelers Ceased operations in the mall on January 20, 2014 after being there for 21 years. The store opened for business in November 1992. Auntie Anne's Left the mall on February 2, 2013, the exact reason for closing was not given, although mall management said it \\"was not related to sales or rent.\\" The mall had records for Auntie Anne's leasing the space that dates back to 1992. When it closed, a lease had already been signed with a new business that opened the next week called Totally Twisted Soft Pretzel Bakery, which also had a location in the Columbia Mall in Bloomsburg. Totally Twisted at the Schuylkill Mall closed in 2017 and relocated to the South Mall in Allentown, where it continues to do business. There was also one other pretzel stand in the Schuylkill Mall, Bavarian Pretzel Bakery, that closed in July 2013. Nirvana's Closet: Closed February 23, 2012 shortly after State troopers from the Schuylkill Haven and Frackville barracks, working in conjunction with the Schuylkill County District Attorney's Office, executed search warrants for a drug raid looking for illegal bath salts and synthetic marijuana. Search warrants were executed about 4 p.m., warrants were also issued for three other locations. Not long after \\"The Pearl Stadium 8\\" began renting out the former store and began a $1.6-million project to expanded into the space to gain an additional 5,000 square feet to house The \\"Screening Room\\", a VIP theater with a lounge, a kitchen and a bar that serves alcohol. Kay Jewelers Closed in 2011 Liberty Travel Closed in 2011 and moved to the Coal Creek Plaza in St. Clair. Sears, the largest tenant the mall ever had, announced the closure of its 112,000 square foot store at the mall in October 2014. Its sister store, K-Mart, closed shortly after. Sister chain Kmart also followed suit in February 2015. Black Diamond Antiques announced they would close their store in May 2016 The Bon-Ton announced in March 2017 that they would close their location here on May 1, 2017. Many stores were closed in mid-2017. Two tenants with storefronts remained opened, Dunham's Sporting Goods (until December 31, 2017 which would later re-open at Pottsville's Fairlane Village Mall on December 7, 2018) and Pearl Stadium 8 Theatres (until January 15, 2018), when preparations for demolition of the 800,000-ft structure began. Pearl Stadium 8 Theatres was the last tenant to close on January 15, 2018 officially closing the mall. Schuylkill Mall Theatres (Pearl Stadium 8) Kings Theater Circuit Theater purchased the former Regal Theater shortly after its closure in October 2010. King Theatre Circuit announced that they planned to install and upgrade the stereo sound system in all four theaters and do a general upgrade. Since 2010 to 2013 the theater owners had been upgrading, renovating, and expanding the outdated 1980's theater. This is the biggest and only renovation to the space since it opened. Once it was complete, it boasts 8 stadium-seated theaters, an upgraded 20,000 watt sound system, much larger movie screens, a digital projection system, new wall coverings and carpets. Another feature to the theater is 2 VIP sections known as \\"The Screening Room\\" it features a bar and restaurant capable of seating 50 people off of the VIP theater and luxury leather seats. This section is only open to patrons 21 and older. The theater also has its own IMAX like experience, the screens measure about 35 feet wide and 40 feet high. They have also redone the entrance of the space, including a new concessions area and restrooms. This was the last tenant in the mall, closing on January 15, 2018. Demolition Demolition of the Schuylkill Mall began on January 26, 2018 after being closed for nearly 11 days. The mall demolition began at the West Wing of the mall where the former Sears store was located and continued to the site of the former Bon-Ton. The East Wing (site of former Blum's Auction) was temporarily untouched as work continued at the site of the former Dunham's. By March 10, 2018, all that was left of the mall was the corridor between Dunham's and the former Kmart and the site of the former's Blum's Auction. On September 5, 2018, demolition was reportedly completed. In late 2019 - early 2020, the Clayco warehouse was built to replace the former Schuylkill Mall that closed on Monday, January 15, 2018.

Cloudflare's services sit between a website's visitor and the Cloudflare user's hosting provider, acting as a reverse proxy for websites. Cloudflare's headquarters are in San Francisco. History Cloudflare was created in 2009 by Matthew Prince, Lee Holloway, and Michelle Zatlyn. It received media attention in June 2011 for providing security services to the website of LulzSec, a black hat hacking group. Cloudflare acts as a reverse proxy for web traffic. Cloudflare supports web protocols, including SPDY and HTTP/2. In addition to this, Cloudflare offers support for HTTP/2 Server Push. From 2009, the company was venture-capital funded. On August 15, 2019, Cloudflare submitted its S-1 filing for IPO on the New York Stock Exchange under the stock ticker NET. It opened for public trading on September 13, 2019, priced at $15 per share. In February 2014, Cloudflare mitigated what was at the time the largest ever recorded DDoS attack, which peaked at 400 Gigabits per second against an undisclosed customer. In November 2014, Cloudflare reported another massive DDoS attack with independent media sites being targeted at 500 Gbit/s. In March 2013, the company defended The Spamhaus Project from a DDoS attack that exceeded 300 Gbit/s. Akamai's chief architect stated that at the time it was \\"the largest publicly announced DDoS attack in the history of the Internet\\". Cloudflare has also reportedly absorbed attacks that have peaked over 400Gbit/s from an NTP Reflection attack. In 2014, Cloudflare introduced an effort called Project Galileo in response to cyberattacks against vulnerable online targets, such as artists, activists, journalists, and human rights groups. Project Galileo provides such groups with free services to protect their websites. In 2019, Cloudflare announced that 600 users and organizations were participating in the project. On April 1, 2019, Cloudflare announced a new freemium Virtual Private Network service named WARP. The service would initially be available through the 1.1.1.1 mobile apps with a desktop app available later. On September 25, 2019, Cloudflare released WARP to the public. The beta for macOS and Windows was announced on April 1, 2020.  Products  = DDoS Protection = Cloudflare provides DDoS mitigation services which protect customers from distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. As of September 2020, the company claims to block \\"an average of 72 billion threats per day, including some of the largest DDoS attacks in history.\\" On September 6th, 2019, Wikipedia became the victim of a DDoS attack. European users were unable to access Wikipedia for several hours. The attack was mitigated after Wikimedia network engineers used Cloudflare's network and DDoS protection services to re-route and filter internet traffic. The specific Cloudflare product used was Magic Transit. = Content Distribution Network = Cloudflare offers a popular Content Distribution Network (CDN) service. The company launched in 2010 and TechCrunch wrote that their goal was to be \\"a CDN for the masses.\\" Ten years later, the company claimed to support over 25 million internet websites. Controversies Cloudflare has faced several controversies over its unwillingness to monitor content distributed via its network‚Äîa stance it has defended based on the principle of free speech. Cloudflare stated that it will \\"continue to abide by the law\\" and \\"serve all customers\\", further explaining \\"our proper role is not that of Internet censor\\". These controversies have involved Cloudflare's policy of content neutrality and subsequent usage of its services by numerous contentious websites, including The Daily Stormer and 8chan, an imageboard which has been linked to multiple mass shootings in the United States and the Christchurch mosque shootings in New Zealand. Under public pressure, Cloudflare terminated services to The Daily Stormer in 2017 and to 8chan following the 2019 El Paso shooting. Cloudflare has come under pressure on multiple occasions due to its policies and for refusing to cease technical support (such as DNS routing and DDoS mitigation) of websites such as LulzSec, The Daily Stormer, and 8chan. Some have argued Cloudflare's services allow access to content which spreads hate and has led to harm and deaths. However Cloudflare, as an Internet infrastructure provider, has broad legal immunity from the content produced by its users. Cloudflare provided DNS routing and DoS protection for the white supremacist and neo-Nazi website, The Daily Stormer. In 2017 Cloudflare stopped providing their services to The Daily Stormer after an announcement on the controversial website asserted that the \\"upper-echelons\\" of Cloudflare were \\"secretly supporters of their ideology\\". Previously Cloudflare had refused to take any action regarding The Daily Stormer. As a self-described \\"free speech absolutist\\", Cloudflare's CEO Matthew Prince, in a blog post, vowed never to succumb to external pressure again and sought to create a \\"political umbrella\\" for the future. Prince further addressed the dangers of large companies deciding what is allowed to stay online, a concern that is shared by a number of civil liberties groups and privacy experts. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a US digital rights group, said that services such as Cloudflare \\"should not be adjudicating what speech is acceptable\\", adding that \\"when illegal activity, like inciting violence or defamation, occurs, the proper channel to deal with it is the legal system.\\" The Huffington Post alleges that Cloudflare provides services to \\"at least 7 terrorist groups\\", as designated by the United States Department of State including the Taliban, Hamas, and the al-Quds Brigades, and have been aware since at least 2012, and have taken no action. However, according to Cloudflare's CEO, no law enforcement agency has asked the company to discontinue these services. In 2019, Cloudflare was criticized for providing services to the discussion and imageboard 8chan, which allows users to post and discuss any content with minimal interference from site administrators. The message board has been linked to mass shootings in the United States and the Christchurch mosque shootings in New Zealand. In addition, a number of news organizations including The Washington Post and The Daily Dot have reported the existence of child pornography and child sexual abuse discussion boards. A Cloudflare representative has been quoted by the BBC saying that the platform \\"does not host the referenced websites, cannot block websites, and is not in the business of hiding companies that host illegal content\\". In an August 3 interview with The Guardian, immediately following the 2019 El Paso shooting, CEO Matthew Prince defended Cloudflare's support of 8chan, stating that he had a \\"moral obligation\\" to keep the site online. In August 2019, Cloudflare terminated services to 8chan, an American imageboard, after the perpetrator of the 2019 El Paso shooting allegedly used the website to upload his manifesto. Cloudflare services have been used by Rescator, a carding website that sells stolen payment card data. Two of the top three online chat forums belonging to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) are guarded by Cloudflare. According to Prince, U.S. law enforcement has not asked Cloudflare to discontinue the service, and they have not chosen to do so themselves. In November 2015, hacktivist group Anonymous discouraged the use of Cloudflare's services following the ISIL attacks in Paris and the renewed accusation that Cloudflare aids terrorists. Cloudflare responded by calling the group \\"15-year-old kids in Guy Fawkes masks\\", and saying that whenever such concerns are raised they consult anti-terrorism experts and abide by the law. In late 2019, Cloudflare was criticized for providing services to the anti-black website Chimpmania. Hundreds of thousands signed a petition on Change.org urging Prince to terminate services to Chimpmania. The petition was created by the parents of a biracial baby who was born with gastroschisis and who was mocked as a ‚Äúmulatto monkey baby‚Äù by site users, and whose pictures were posted on the site. Over the ten years the site has been active, numerous other petitions have also been leveled against it, none of which were successful. Security and privacy The hacker group UGNazi attacked Cloudflare partially by exploiting flaws in Google's authentication systems in June 2012, gaining administrative access to Cloudflare and using it to deface 4chan. From September 2016 until February 2017, a major Cloudflare bug (nicknamed Cloudbleed) leaked sensitive data, including passwords and authentication tokens, from customer websites by sending extra data in response to web requests. The leaks resulted from a buffer overflow which occurred, according to analysis by Cloudflare, on approximately 1 in every 3,300,000 HTTP requests. In May 2017, ProPublica reported that Cloudflare as a matter of policy relays the names and email addresses of persons complaining about hate sites to the sites in question, which has led to the complainants being harassed. Cloudflare's general counsel defended the company's policies by saying it is \\"base constitutional law that people can face their accusers\\". In response to the report, Cloudflare updated their abuse reporting process to provide greater control over who is notified of the complaining party. Cloudflare is cited in reports by The Spamhaus Project, an international spam tracking organization, due to high numbers of cybercriminal botnet operations 'hosted' on Cloudflare services. An October 2015 report found that Cloudflare provisioned 40% of SSL certificates used by phishing sites with deceptive domain names resembling those of banks and payment processors. Cloudflare suffered a major outage on July 2, 2019, which rendered more than 12 million websites (80% of all customers) unreachable for 27 minutes. A similar outage occurred on July 17, 2020, causing a similar effect and impacting the same amount of sites.

It is a collection of \\"lost\\" tales that fill in the gaps between Ranger's Apprentice novels. The book was released in Australia on 3 October 2011 and in New Zealand on 7 October 2011. It is available in many languages, including Czech, Korean, and Dutch. It is available in hardcover, paperback, ebook, and audiobook.  Plot  The book begins with a scene many years in the future. A professor named Giles MacFarlane is overseeing an archaeological expedition when his assistant, Audrey, finds a little house in an area which is outside the village limits. Inside, Professor MacFarlane finds stories that tell what happens to the Rangers after they return from Nihon-Ja. In the chronicles, Gilan battles several thieves who are trying to kill Jenny, Will's hideous speech ignites a purple fire as he fights a moondarker, Evanlyn and Horace are married and at the end of the book Will and Alyss are married as well.  Synopsis  = Foreword = In the Republic of Aralan States (formerly the medieval Kingdom of Araluen), in Redman County, the archeologist Professor Giles MacFarlane and his team have excavated the remains of the infamous triangular Castle Redmont. He hoped to find proof of the legendary Rangers Corps‚Äô existence. In their third season on the site, a spry, energetic university volunteer named Audrey came across the remains of Will Treaty's cabin in the woods. There MacFarlane found a chest containing the Lost Stories of Araluen, chronicling what happened to Will, Halt and the rest after they returned from Nihon-Ja, giving the Professor the proof he was after. He then proceeds to read them. = Death of a Hero = Will Treaty, after gathering local gossip, returns to his little cabin in the woods to find Halt, his mentor and friend, waiting there for him. After coffee, Halt hesitantly tells Will a tale of his parents from immediately after the battle at Hackham Heath against Morgarath's army: upon losing that battle, Morgarath did not surrender, preferring instead to keep throwing his troops at the Kingdom's forces to cause as many losses as possible. In one of the skirmishes Halt steps up to take command of a failing flank. He notices that the Araluen line might collapse before he arrives on the front lines. He therefore stops at the back to empty his quiver of arrows into the enemy's front line, halting their advance. Halt rallies the Araluen troops but gets knocked to the ground by a club, stunned. A sergeant takes the lead, standing over Halt and then leading the charge to win the skirmish, all while enduring multiple wounds. As the sergeant lies dying on the ground, he tells Halt that his name is Daniel and that Halt should promise to take care of his wife and baby, which he does. Waking up in a healer's tent, Halt immediately sets off to find out where Daniel lived. He learns that two cheats, Kord and Jerrel, might know where Daniel lived as they asked for people's homes before playing. Halt, undercover as a soldier named Arratay, joins the gambler's tent. After pretending to imbibe copious amounts of drink, letting slip that there might be another arduous campaign and pretending to fall asleep, Halt overhears the two planning to desert the army and pillage Daniel's home first as it was the closest. Halt follows the deserters for a day and half, finally arriving at Daniel's farm. The farm was on fire and Kord and Jerrel were terrorizing the widow and her child. Halt intervenes, stabbing Kord but upon confronting Jerrel, Kord, as a last act, trips Halt. Daniel's widow jumps on Jerrel, who was about to kill Halt, saving his life but giving up hers in the process. Halt dispatches Jerrel and promises the dying woman that he would take care of the baby, whose name she reveals to be Will. After burying the woman and leaving the thieves to the crows, Halt takes Will to the Ward, an orphanage at Redmont Fief for those whose parents died in service. Halt reveals to the now grown Will that he hadn‚Äôt told him until this point because he was afraid Will would blame him as he viewed Will's parents‚Äô deaths as his fault but Will comforts Halt, claiming Halt gave him the chance for a new family. = The Inkwell and the Dagger = While Halt leaves to rescue Will and Princess Evanlyn from Skandia in The Icebound Land, Gilan returns to Castle Araluen. Ranger Commandant Crowley tasks Gilan with finding Foldar, a pitiless, thieving murderer, among all the fake Foldars who took on the notorious name to terrorize victims. Gilan narrows down suspicious cases until he finds a bloody and large-scale robbery that occurred in Highcliff Fief, which had also been missing its local Ranger. Upon arriving at Castle Highcliff, Gilan meets the seneschal, Philip, who acts a little guilty. Baron Douglas, however was a plump and emphatic pomposity. At a tavern, Gilan meets the young widowed barker, Maeve, who informs him that Philip had racked up high gambling debts. She also thinks she saw Philip heading towards Ambrose Turner's house, the man to whom he owed the most. On his way back to the castle, Gilan is ambushed by two crossbowmen. He dodges the bolts by dropping off his horse and then conceals himself in his Ranger's cloak, which can render a still wearer nigh on invisible because of its mottling. Lying still and silent on the ground, he overhears the men talking with someone they call Lord Foldar and Gilan realizes that only two people knew his true purpose in coming to Highcliff and could have informed Foldar of his plans. That night Gilan follows Philip from a large house in the village to the treasury stronghold next to his quarters, in which Philip places a sack of money. The next day Gilan explains the trap planned for Foldar to Baron Douglas. Gilan would go out with a small, empty wagon and then the normal wagon would leave carrying the tax money. This way, Foldar might think the money would be in the small wagon and that the normal wagon was a decoy. Gilan also orders the commander of local archers to conceal six archers in a copse along the tax route. As the normal wagon approaches the trees, Foldar sends a small ambush to draw off the escort and then attacks with a larger force. However, the archers fend him off and Gilan gives chase. Gilan slays Foldar in the ensuing sword fight. Gilan explained that at night, he had switched the tax money again to the small wagon because he knew the informant would tell Foldar of the original plan. Gilan reveals that the Baron was in league with Foldar, while Philip on his late night trips had just been working to repay the fief's treasury from which he had paid off his debts. = The Roamers = Halt and Will apprehend a group of river pirates who had been killing and pillaging river trade boats. They had concealed themselves aboard trade boats for four days and then stopped the attack when the pirates finally showed themselves, relying on their infamous reputation as Rangers as much as their skills to stop the attack. As the two Rangers return to their cabin in the woods, a castle Courier, Alyss, Will's unwitting crush, frantically gallops up and informs Will that Ebony, his dog, went missing three days prior. Will realizes that Roamers, migrant performers and musicians who travel in familial bands and in whose wake missing things follow, probably took Ebony. Halt suggests Will and Alyss go together because a woman is less suspicious to the Roamers than a strapping young man and that the two go as fast as possible because the Roamers liked staging dog fights. Will and Alyss, disguised as simple country folk track the Roamers for a two days, stopping one night in barn where they receive another warning of the dangers of leaving a dog with the Roamers. On day three, the pair catch up to the Roamers and do some reconnoitering that night. They deduce from a conversation in a tavern that there would be a dog fight in another couple days. Spying on the Roamers again, Alyss devises a plan to take the place of an old servant woman name Hilde, disguising herself to look like the hag. Will made sure that Alyss' disguise held, before taking the old woman to the nearby village and helping her make a new life at a friend's restaurant. Alyss follows two of the Roamers, Petulengo and Jerome, as they head out to the woods, assumably to feed the dogs meant for fighting. Alyss ends up being called to help move the dogs. She finds Ebony there, but is attacked by a vicious dog that Jerome lost control of. Will shoots it before it can hurt Alyss, but it doesn't die and it kills Jerome when he falls over it. Returning to the Roamer camp, Will gives them a dire warning to leave the kingdom and they obey. = Purple Prose = Will reviews a speech for the royal wedding of the knight Horace and Princess Evanlyn, two of his closest friends, in front Halt and his wife Pauline, the head Courier. They conclude it is a bit pompous and florid in language, although Will is very fond of it. Halt informs Will of a mission to stop a group of moondarkers, shipwrecking gangs who lure boats onto dangerous coastlines and the steal the cargo, who had been moving up the coast. Will and Halt arrive at a coastal village, where they find the moondarker's camp, do some scouting and devise a plan of action. When a ship is spotted on the horizon, Halt alerts the village guards and Will changes the color of the beacon fire that the moondarkers set up to lure in ships. The moondarkers are arrested, but Will's speech is accidentally tossed in the beacon fire, much to his dismay. Halt draws out of Will the true message he wanted to tell his friends and both Will and Halt are happier with the result. = Dinner for Five = Jenny, the owner of the restaurant to which Will had sent Hilde in \\"The Roamers\\", is preparing her home for a romantic dinner for two with the handsome Ranger Gilan. While will is trying to work on his speech for the royal wedding At the same time, three robbers break into Ambrose's safe box, which held the jewels and ingots of the silversmith's trade. The three robbers enter Jenny's house, thinking she would be at her restaurant, but recover quickly and restrain her. Gilan arrives at the Keep of Baron Arald, the Baron of Redmont Fief, where a watchman tells Gilan and the Baron about the robbery. The thieves in Jenny's home learn that Gilan would be stopping by and realize they must eliminate both the Ranger and Jenny in order to pull off the heist. With her womanly protectiveness kicking in, Jenny manages to disable two of the robbers but the third makes it out the door. However, he runs straight into Gilan, who apprehends the thieves and then soothes Jenny, who was crying because their dinner had been ruined. = The Bridal Dance = As preparations for Horace and Evanlyn's wedding commence, a series of mishaps befall Castle Redmont. Will investigates the accidents and comes up with Robard, the assistant steward who was recently demoted. In a meeting with Will, Robard admits to the crimes, but doesn‚Äôt give up everything. The next day, Robard is discovered dead - what seemed like suicide by poison - with a piece of a paper with two names on it the only suspicious thing in the room. Following the names around town, Will discovers they were aliases and the men to whom those names belonged were probably Genovesan assassins. Talking it over with Halt, the two Rangers conclude that there is a distinct danger because King Duncan and royal dignitaries from other countries would be coming to Redmont very soon for Horace and Princess Evanlyn's wedding. A new piece of evidence came to light from Robard's room, but Will could make neither heads nor tails of it. The day of the wedding arrived and as Will gave his speech (albeit unwritten and unprepared because of the story \\"Purple Prose\\"), he realized that there was a gallery above the dance hall where assassins would have a perfect window of opportunity to strike. Gathering a Skandian friend, Nils, Will hurried up the steps leading to the gallery. There, he and Nils overcame two assassins in the nick of time and Will just barely made it back in time for a dance with his sweetheart Alyss, who would have murdered him for missing the dance. As it was, she gave him a dire warning not to miss their wedding dance, when Will finally proposed. = The Hibernian = Many years earlier, in Gorlan Fief, a young Crowley stops by a tavern on his return journey to Hogarth Fief. There he confronts three drunken, rowdy soldiers who he subdues with the help of a Hibernian - the younger Halt. Crowley and Halt immediately hit it off and Halt decides to travel with Crowley, who discovers that they shared the same mentor, the Ranger Pritchard. They go to report the soldiers to their Baron, Baron Morgarath (before Morgarath decided to rebel against the kingdom). Morgarath made a bad impression on Halt and so when Morgarath tried to recruit him, Halt promptly turned the Baron down, in his classic curt manner. After parting ways, Halt once again assists Crowley by riding to his rescue as Crowley is cornered by five of Morgarath's soldiers. Crowley then convinces Halt to join him as he goes to find the then-Prince Duncan and reform the Ranger Corps from the bedraggled, corrupted group it was. = The Wolf = When a huge, renegade wolf attacks a young child, Will is called to deal with the menace. The wolf attacks Tug, Will's horse and best friend, as Will and Tug are tracking it, tearing a large gash in Tug's shoulder. Will manages to kill the beast before it does any more damage to Tug. Calling Old Bob, the horse wizard, to take a look at the wound, Will learns that Tug will never fully recover. Will must retire Tug to Old Bob's Ranger horse ranch, where the lineage of all the Ranger horse breeds are preserved and bred for. He receives a new horse, who takes on the name Tug and acts almost like the old Tug, while the old Tug becomes Bellerophon and joins the breeding program. = And About Time Too... = Finally, at long last, Will and Alyss are married, with Horace as best man, Tug as best horse, and Ebony as best dog. Halt tries to hold it together but finally breaks down and cries as he finally sees his once before apprentice getting married. And it is about time too... = Afterword = The final fragment in the collection of stories that were contained in the chest puzzled Professor Macfarlane, as they referred to a legend even more singular than the Ranger Corps: the Brotherband - led by a boy who was half Araluen and half Skandian and who had revolutionized the design of the Skandian wolfship.

He was the son of William Beamish, Esq., of Beaumont House, County Cork. In November 1816 he obtained a commission in the 4th Royal Irish Dragoon Guards, in which corps he purchased a troop in 1823. In 1825 he published an English translation of a small cavalry manual written by Count Friedrich Wilhelm von Bismarck, a distinguished officer then engaged in the reorganisation of the Wurtemberg cavalry. Beamish's professional abilities brought him to notice, and he received a half-pay majority in the following year. Whilst attached to the vice-regal suite in Hanover he subsequently published a translation of Count von Bismarck's Lectures on Cavalry, with original notes, in which he suggested various changes soon after adopted in the British cavalry. He also completed and edited a history of the King's German Legion from its formation in the British service in 1803 to its disbandment in 1816, which was published in England in 1834-7, and is a model of military compilations of its class. After quitting Hanover Beamish devoted much attention to Norse antiquities, and in 1841 published a summary of the researches of Professor Carl Christian Rafn, relative to the discovery of America by the Northmen in the tenth century. Although the fact had been notified as early as 1828 (in a letter in Niles' Register, Boston, U.S.), it was very little known. Beamish's modest volume not only popularised the discovery by epitomising the principal details in Rafn's great work Antiquitates American√¶ (Copenhagen, 1837), but it contains, in the shape of translations from the Sagas, one of the best summaries of Icelandic historical literature anywhere to be found within an equal space. Beamish, like his younger brother, Richard, who was at one time in the Grenadier guards, was a Fellow of the Royal Society and an associate of various learned bodies. He died at Annmount, co. Cork, on 27 April 1872.

In the Bah√°'√≠ Faith, this is known as the Edict of Toleration and has a prophetic significance. Background The edict took place during the process referred to as the Eastern Question in relations between European powers, Britain in particular, and the Ottoman Empire in its development at a time referred to as Tanzimat internally which included other initiatives like ending the Ottoman slave trade. It was largely a result of pressure from the British government to stop to the persecutions of the Christians. Tanzimat was an Ottoman reform process that sought equal protections under the law in Ottoman lands for all people; however, it did not address matters of religious freedom. A particular incident in 1843 with an Armenian Ottoman subject sparked an incident in August which gained international entanglements and then a Greek national in November, both of whom were put to death - the process of which became the Edict in March 1844. Reverend Edward Bickersteth referred to these developments in 1844 when he summarized diplomatic notesThe original notes of the diplomatic letter noting this edict can be obtained from the Public Record Office in London. A translation of the edict, an acknowledgment from Stratford Canning, 1st Viscount Stratford de Redcliffe to the Sublime Porte, and an accompanying letter from Canning, dated 23 March 1844, is in Foreign Office, Turkey, FO78/555/No.49. There are several other letters from Canning in the same volume on the question of the religious intolerance of the Turks. The draft of a letter from the Foreign Office, dated 16 January 1844, which made plain the attitude of the British government and which provided the direct impetus for the negotiations leading eventually to the issue of the edict, is in FO78/552/No. 4. presented to the British Parliament noting \\"The correspondence occupied a considerable part of the year‚Äîfrom Aug. 27, 1843, to April 19, 1844.\\" Note (edict) In February 1844 there is a question on the status of Jew apostates from Islam (who, it was claimed, must pass through being Christian on the way to Islam in the first place) and on March 21, 1844 appears (in translation): > It is the special and constant intention of His Highness the Sultan that his > cordial relations with the High Powers be preserved, and that a perfect > reciprocal friendship be maintained and increased. > The Sublime Porte engage to take effectual measures to prevent henceforward > the execution and putting to death of the Christian who is an apostate. According to Muslim Islamic scholar Cyril Glass√©, death for apostasy in Islam was \\"not in practice enforced\\" in later times in the Muslim world, and was \\"completely abolished\\" by \\"a decree of the Ottoman government in 1260AH/1844AD.\\" This short edict was advanced in the wider Ottoman Reform Edict of 1856. Prophetic interpretations The Edict was seen by some especially among the religious as a specific sign leading towards the fulfillment of prophecy. Research conducted by Michael Sours into this subject and the records of the development of the Edict did not refer directly to the Jews but rather infers religious tolerance through ending executions for apostasy for Jews that seemed to convert making their social situation easier while actually keeping their personal and group identity in their Judaic religion. Jerusalem has had the largest Jewish population in Palestine in recent centuries since about 1844 and been majority Jewish since about 1852. The Edict was first publicly commented upon by Reverend Edward Bickersteth in his publication, Practical Guide to the Prophecies in the 1844 edition. Adventist William Miller, and those that disagreed with him, though unaware of the Edict and the diplomacy around it, still looked to the fortunes of the Ottoman Empire even in the period. Miller pointed to the year because of the 2300 day prophecy of , relying on the Day-year principle. The 2300 days are understood to represent 2300 years stretching from 457 BC, the calculated starting date of the 70 weeks prophecy based on the 3rd decree found in Ezra, thus leading to 1843/4. Bickersteth acknowledged the same interpretation and added a second - - as a parallel to start the clock for understanding ; taking 390 years as a period for persecution of Christians in the End time. Bickersteth takes this persecution from the triumph of Ottoman rule of Constantinople in 1453, thus 1453+390 is 1843/4, directly before these events. Thus, independently of Miller, a number of Christian authors followed the significance of this declaration from Bickersteth including Alfred Edersheim, a Jewish convert to Christianity and a Biblical scholar, and Henry Grattan Guinness who broadened the themes of the understanding of the edict and its importance, and into the early 20th century with Worth Smith who mentioned it in his 1934 Miracle of the Ages. Adventist mention of the Edict wasn't until 1917. Thornton Chase, commonly recognized as the first convert to the Bah√°'√≠ Faith of Occidental background, noted the Edict in his publication The Bahai Revelation published in 1909. An Irish convert to the religion, George Townshend was the first broadly published to mention the Edict in Bah√°'√≠ literature in 1944 when he wrote: > The proclamation of His Faith was made in 1844, the year when the strict > exclusion of the Jews from their own land enforced by the Muslims for some > twelve centuries was at last relaxed by the Edict of Toleration and \\"the > times of the Gentiles\\" were \\"fulfilled.\\" in the introduction to Shoghi Effendi's book, God Passes By, published in 1944. This was also centrally mentioned by William Sears in his book Thief in the Night originally published in 1961 and in its 17th edition circa 2012. Both Townshend and Sears had high offices in the religion as Hands of the Cause.

It sits at the south end of Dahlgren Avenue, the Yard's main road, two blocks south of the Latrobe Gate near the Anacostia River. After renovation in 1993, it became offices for the Naval Historical Center. Since 2005, the building has been restored to its historical use as office of the Commandant.

Robbins Brown, 1973, History A building for officers' use at the Yard was first proposed in 1828 and is shown on an 1842 map. Though clear records of the construction have not been found, proposed improvements of $2,500 in 1837 and $2,000 in 1838 were made for a \\"Building for officers.\\" George Watterson described the building in 1842 in his New Guide to Washington as \\"a neat and beautiful building of brick, two-stories high, with verandas running all around it, has lately been erected as offices, for the officers and others doing business in this establishment.\\" A trophy park just south of the building \\"consisted of a semi-circle of captured Naval cannons graduated from the center by size with other guns and stacks of round shot placed between this semi-circle and the office.\\" The park was built before 1842 and eliminated about 1945. Commandant John Adolphus Dahlgren, who was given command of the Yard just before the Civil War, gave up the Commandant's House where he had lived, for the use of the officers of the 71st New York Regiment. He then slept and dined in the room across from his office in Building One. President Abraham Lincoln often visited Dahlgren at his offices, stating \\"I like to see Dahlgren. The drive to the Navy Yard is one of my greatest pleasures. When I am depressed, I like to talk with Dahlgren. I learn something of the preparations for defense, and I get from him consolation and courage.\\" In 1873 the building was renovated and expanded. In 1941 it became a post office and communications center, then in 1948 was remodeled to serve as officer quarters and renamed Quarters J. In 1976 the building became the Yard's visitors center and also housed the Navy Sea Cadets. It returned to use as offices after a 1993 renovation.

Past megadroughts have been associated with persistent multiyear La Ni√±a conditions (cooler than normal water temperatures in the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean). The term megadrought is generally used to describe the length of a drought, and not its acute intensity. In scientific literature the term is used to describe decades-long droughts or multi-decadal droughts. Multiyear droughts of less than a decade, such as the Dust Bowl drought of the 1930s, are generally not described as megadroughts even though they are of a long duration. In popular literature multiyear or even single year droughts are occasionally described as megadroughts based upon their severity, the economic damage they inflict or other criteria, but this is the exception and not the rule.  Impact  Megadroughts have historically led to the mass migration of humans away from drought affected lands, resulting in a significant population decline from pre-drought levels. They are suspected of playing a primary role in the collapse of several pre-industrial civilizations, including the Anasazi of the North American Southwest, the Khmer Empire of Cambodia, the Mayan of Mesoamerica, the Tiwanaku of Bolivia, and the Yuan Dynasty of China. The African Sahel region in particular has suffered multiple megadroughts throughout history, with the most recent lasting from approximately 1400 AD to 1750 AD. North America experienced at least four megadroughts during the Medieval Warm Period.  Historical evidence  Montezuma Bald Cypress tree, 900 years old There are several sources for establishing the past occurrence and frequency of megadroughts, including: * When megadroughts occur, lakes dry up and trees and other plants grow in the dry lake beds. When the drought ends the lakes refill; when this happens the trees are submerged and die. In some locations these trees have remained preserved and can be studied giving accurate radio-carbon dates, and the tree rings of the same long dead trees can be studied. Such trees have been found in Mono and Tenaya lakes in California, Lake Bosumtwi in Ghana; and various other lakes. * Dendrochronology, the dating and study of annual rings in trees. The tree-ring data indicate that the Western U.S. states have experienced droughts that lasted ten times longer than anything the modern U.S. has seen. Based on annual tree rings, NOAA has recorded patterns of drought covering most of the U.S. for every year since 1700. Certain species of trees have given evidence over a longer period, in particular Montezuma Cypress and Bristlecone pine trees. The University of Arkansas has produced a 1238-year tree-ring based chronology of weather condition in central Mexico by examining core samples taken from living Montezuma Cypress trees. * Sediment core samples taken at the volcanic caldera in Valles Caldera, New Mexico and other locations. The cores from Valles Caldera go back 550,000 years and show evidence of megadroughts that lasted as long as 1000 years during the mid-Pleistocene Epoch during which summer rains were almost non-existent. Plant and pollen remains found in core samples from the bottom of lakes have been also studied and added to the record. * Fossil corals on Palmyra Atoll. Using the relationship between tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures and the oxygen isotope ratio in living corals to convert fossil coral records into sea surface temperatures. This has been used to establish the occurrence and frequency of La Ni√±a conditions. * During a 200-year mega drought in the Sierra Nevada that lasted from the 9th to the 12th centuries, trees would grow on newly exposed shoreline at Fallen Leaf Lake, then as the lake grew once again, the trees were preserved under cold water. However, a 2016‚Äì2017 expedition by the Undersea Voyager Project found evidence that the ancient trees did not grow there during an ancient drought, but rather slid into the lake during one of the many seismic events that have occurred in the Tahoe Basin since it was formed.

Pictures, produced by Edmund Grainger and directed by Lewis Seiler, from an original story by Jerry Wald and Richard Macaulay. The film stars Virginia Bruce, Dennis Morgan, Wayne Morris, and Ralph Bellamy as airline employees, flying Douglas DST airliners. The basic premise of the film follows the operational conditions of a commercial airline, while also following its stewardesses and pilots as they go through their daily routines, punctuated with the details of their personal lives. Plot Although \\"ace\\" commercial airline pilot, Chick Faber (Dennis Morgan) is grounded by Flight Superintendent Bill Graves (Ralph Bellamy) when a flight physical reveals that his eyesight is failing. Aided by stewardess Mary Norvell (Virginia Bruce) and her friend, Nan Hudson (Jane Wyman), Graves persuades Chick to take a job as teacher in the school for stewardesses. While he remains at the airline, along with engineer, Artie Dixon (Wayne Morris), he continues work on the design of a secret research aircraft, he calls the \\"stratosphere ship\\" that will revolutionize commercial aviation by flying faster and higher than any current type. After Farber and Norvell get married, he finds that teaching is too restrictive and yearns to get back to his secret project. When he learns that the US Army Air Corps is going to test his aircraft, he attempts to get permission to make the first flight, but is refused due to his failing eyesight. Coming back after hours, Farber takes off and puts his secret aircraft through a high altitude test although Graves warns him by radio that the aircraft is too dangerous to fly without further development. At height, windows blow in and Farber barely recovers from going unconscious and pulling out of a high-speed dive, to make a crash landing back at his base. Angrily giving up his pilot's license, he decides to leave his wife and join the newly formed Chinese mercenary air force fighting against Japan. Air Corps officers intercept him in San Francisco and call him back to active duty in the military to keep the secret of the \\"stratosphere ship\\" in US hands. Graves rearranges Mary's flight schedule, sending her to San Antonio, where she is met by newly promoted Capt. Farber, now a flight instructor at Randolph Field. The reunited couple are finally at peace, knowing that everything will turn out all right. Cast As appearing in screen credits (main roles identified):\\"Credits: 'Flight Angels' (1940).\\" IMDb.

Principal photography consisting of aerial shots and exteriors took place at Burbank Airport, California. Although a mix of studio mock-ups, real aircraft and model work was used effectively, the stock footage of DC-3s at the beginning of the film led to \\"Flagship Illinois\\" becoming \\"Flagship Tennessee\\" as the airliner begins to taxi from the gate and then becomes the \\"Flagship Illinois\\" again as passengers are leaving after a bumpy landing, necessitated by the birth on board of a baby. The cast was made up of a large group of both rising and falling stars that were not typical of a lesser film. While filming Flight Angels in 1940, Wayne Morris became interested in flying and became a Naval Aviator. When war was imminent, Morris joined the Naval Reserve and became a Navy flier in 1942, leaving his film career behind for the duration of the war. Flying the Grumman F6F Hellcat off the aircraft carrier USS Essex, Morris shot down seven Japanese aircraft and contributed to the sinking of five ships. =Aircraft= The film featured: * Boeing 247 airliner (under the title credits, bearing the United Air Lines logo) * Douglas DC-3/DST airliners (in American Airlines \\"Flagship\\" livery) * Lockheed Model 12A Electra Junior subbing for the \\"stratosphere ship.\\" Lockheed 12A, registration number NC17342, was owned by Lang Transportation, Las Vegas, Nevada, and was also used in the 1937 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film Rosalie, Happy Landing (1938) and Secret Service of the Air (1938).Nagl, Roy. \\"Lockheed Model 12A Electra Junior.\\" Ancient Airliners.

It is variously called a steering knuckle, spindle, upright or hub, as well. The wheel and tire assembly attach to the hub or spindle of the knuckle where the tire/wheel rotates while being held in a stable plane of motion by the knuckle/suspension assembly. In the attached photograph of a double-wishbone suspension, the knuckle is shown attached to the upper control arm at the top and the lower control arm at the bottom. The wheel assembly is shown attached to the knuckle at its center point. Note the arm of the knuckle that sticks out, to which the steering mechanism attaches to turn the knuckle and wheel assembly. Types Steering knuckles come in all shapes and sizes. Their designs differ to fit all sorts of applications and suspension types. However, they can be divided into two main types. One comes with a hub and the other comes with a spindle. Applications In a non-drive suspension, as shown in the first photo, the knuckle usually has a spindle onto which the brake drum or brake rotor attaches. (In this picture, the central spindle upon which the wheel assembly rides cannot be seen.) The wheel/tire assembly then attaches to the supplied lug studs, and the whole assembly rotates freely on the shaft of the spindle. In a drive suspension, the knuckle has no spindle, but rather has a hub into which is affixed the bearings and shaft of the drive mechanism. The end of the drive mechanism would then have the necessary mounting studs for the wheel/tire and/or brake assembly. Therefore, the wheel assembly would rotate as the drive shaft (or half-shaft) dictates. It would not turn freely by itself, but only if the shaft was disengaged from the transaxle or differential. A driven suspension as described may also be steerable. This is often called a drive/steer arrangement.

Macdonell was the Detroit Times hockey and golf reporter in the early 1930s, but he was recruited to cover the Detroit Tigers for the 1934 World Series. In March 1937, Macdonell gave up the hockey beat at the Detroit Times to cover the Tigers on a full-time basis. By the late 1930s, he was also the sports editor at the Detroit Times. In 1939, Macdonell was added to the committee of 24 baseball writers responsible for selecting the American League's Most Valuable Player. The Detroit Times was part of the Hearst newspaper syndicate, and Macdonell's baseball writing was often published in other Hearst newspapers through the International News Service, Hearst's wire service. In July 1945, Macdonell's story about Hank Greenberg hitting a home run in his first game after returning from wartime military service was published in Hearst newspapers across the country and for military personnel in Stars and Stripes. In October 1945, Macdonell was elected as the vice president of the Baseball Writers' Association of America. He became the president of the Baseball Writers' Association of America in 1946. He was also selected to serve on the Association's board of directors in October 1947. Macdonell also served as official scorer at the 1946 World Series between the St. Louis Cardinals and Boston Red Sox. Macdonell insisted to his fellow reporters that \\"the toughest decision for a sports writer to make was the one that would take him off his beat.\\" Explaining his love for sports writing, Macdonell once asked and answered this question while interviewing Hank Greenberg: \\"When millionaires retire what do they do? They go to big golf tournaments, visit Florida baseball camps, attend big prize fights and watch Davis Cup matches at Forest Hills. It is their idea of paradise, the ideal existence. A sports writer is even closer to the fun than an ordinary spectator. Why should he give up all that if his health is OK?\\" Later years and death Macdonell was married to Mary (Schibret) Macdonell. They had two sons Robert (1921-1994) and Donald (1924-1956) and a daughter, Mrs. Daniel Sheahan. Macdonell suffered from Parkinson's disease during the last several years of his life. He retired in the summer of 1957 and moved to Northridge, Los Angeles, California. He died there in October 1957 at age 69.

Allbright was hired by the Brooklyn Dodgers to announce recreated games played away from Ebbets Field to a network of radio stations on the East Coast that included more than 100 stations, providing facsimile coverage of 1,500 Dodgers games, despite never having seen one in person. Early life Allbright was born in Dallas, Texas on November 26, 1923. As a child, he moved with his family to Ridgeway, Virginia, and would recreate games in his imagination using lineups that he had taken from the local paper. He served in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II. After receiving training in radio broadcasting, Allbright hosted musical and dance programs on the air, and covered baseball and other sporting events for stations in the Washington area, producing both live and recreated accounts. Dodgers game recreation Walter O'Malley, owner of the Dodgers, wanted to create a radio network to reach fans of the Dodgers located on the East Coast of the United States. Someone who had previous experience simulating games was desired, as such broadcasts were far less expensive than sending announcers and the required support staff to various stadiums. Assigned to find the right candidate, Dodgers president Buzzie Bavasi hired Allbright, who was working at the time for radio station WEAM in Virginia. Invited to spend time with the Dodgers at spring training, he observed the players in action, with an eye for details of each player's mannerisms that he could use in his recreations. Allbright began his broadcasting career with the Dodgers in 1949, and his recreations were presented on more than 100 radio stations by the following season. During his time with the Dodgers, he broadcast 1,500 games from a studio in Washington, D.C., beginning each one with a statement required by the Federal Communications Commission that the contents of the radio program were a recreation of an actual game and then starting each game by stating \\"This is Nat Allbright, from Ebbets Field!\\"Martin, Douglas. \\"Nat Allbright, Voice of Dodgers Games He Did Not See, Dies at 87\\", The New York Times, August 15, 2011.

Allbright maintained notes and pictures in his studio of each National League ballpark to help make his descriptions as vivid as possible. An assistant sitting outside his recording booth would take details from the play by play feed and prepare a script listing the details of each half inning. Allbright would be notified of any gap in game play so that he would be able to stretch out the material with added commentary until the typed sheets needed for the next half inning were completed. Using the information transmitted about each pitch from the ballpark, Allbright would provide a running account of the game, using his knowledge of the players and their individual characteristics and quirks to provide a running color commentary for a game he could not see. Most of the sound effects he used were from recordings, though he had a knack for using dental clicks to simulate the sound of a ball being struck by the bat. He used records and tape recordings of the National Anthem, crowd murmurs, roars and jeers to help maintain the verisimilitude of the broadcasts, though sportswriter Leslie Timms of the Spartanburg Herald-Journal would reminisce that he could never figure out why the same vendor was shouting \\"Cold Beer, Here\\" regardless of which stadium the Dodgers were playing in.Timms, Leslie. \\"Remembering Joe Louis\\", Spartanburg Herald-Journal, May 2, 1976. Accessed August 16, 2011. \\"I remember listening to Nat Allbright recreate the Dodgers games from a studio somewhere other than the ballpark, and I remember I kept wondering how the same guy kept yelling 'Cold Beer, Here' in all of the different ballparks.\\" Allbright himself supplied the voice of the beer vendor, leaning away from the microphone to simulate the voice coming from the stands. If transmissions were not received from the live game, he might add in improvised foul balls; extensive lags could be turned into an imaginary rain delay to buy additional time, with thunder simulated by crinkling a piece of cellophane.Landphair, Ted. \\"Re- Creations Not Going, Going but GONE\\", Voice of America, July 26, 2011.

You know, if you take the cellophane off a pack of cigarettes and crumple it up near the microphone, it sounds just like thunder.\\" In a 1955 article, sportswriter Red Smith described how Allbright never claimed to be broadcasting from Ebbets Field, but didn't make it clear that he wasn't, \\"kind of leaving it up to the listeners to decide for themselves.\\"Smith, Red, via New York Herald Tribune. \\"Radio Fakery Turns Up a Lovely Situation for Traveling Better: Nat Allbright, Sportscaster in Washington, Makes Listeners Think He's at Game\\", The Milwaukee Journal, October 29, 1955.

After Fred Saigh, then owner of 90% of the St. Louis Cardinals, was convicted of income tax evasion and sentenced to 15 months in federal prison in January 1953, Allbright was part of a group of prospective buyers that sought to buy the team from Saigh.Drebinger, John. \\"Berra Signs as Yankees Raise Salary to About $37,000; Reynolds Defers Decision on Offer\\", The New York Times, January 30, 1953.

Although he said the $3.75 million bid he received from Anheuser-Busch was lower than offers from interests in Milwaukee and Houston, he accepted it to insure continuing local control.\\" From 1950 until 1961, Allbright did 1,500 broadcasts of games played by the Dodgers, though he never saw the team play in person. Washington Post sportswriter Bob Addie called Allbright the \\"king of the baseball re-creators\\", an art whose practitioners included Ronald Reagan. He was awarded a ring when the Dodgers won the 1955 World Series, their only championship in Brooklyn. Improving technology and the move of the Dodgers to Los Angeles in 1958 cost Allbright many of his fans, with the team's evening home games starting at 11:00 PM in the Eastern Time Zone where his radio stations were located. Custom recreations In the years after he retired from broadcasting for the Dodgers, Allbright began a company producing simulated recreations of sporting events, in which he would insert names supplied by customers as part of the recording. One client wanted to have himself inserted as a catcher for Dizzy Dean, pitching for the Cardinals in the 1934 World Series against the Detroit Tigers, while another customer had his father's name inserted into a game in which he supposedly played alongside Babe Ruth for the New York Yankees. Other recordings had couch potatoes playing for the Boston Celtics, boxing at Madison Square Garden and playing golf at the U.S. Open. During the 1981 Major League Baseball strike, Allbright produced a manufactured account of the All- Star Game that was scheduled to have been played that year at Municipal Stadium in Cleveland, but had been cancelled due to the work stoppage. The Washington Post lauded \\"the fantasy created by Mr. Allbright\\" that evening, noting that he \\"had listeners sensing a breezy, summer Ohio night perfect for baseball\\". Before the strike was settled after half of the 1982 NFL season had been lost, Allbright broadcast eight simulated games featuring the Washington Redskins facing their scheduled opponents, setting the imaginary pace for a season in which the Redskins would in reality go on to win Super Bowl XVII. Death Allbright died of pneumonia on July 18, 2011, in Arlington, Virginia at the Virginia Hospital Center.Schudel, Matt. \\"Nat Allbright, announcer who relied on imagination to re-create ballgames, dies at 87\\", The Washington Post, August 6, 2011.

It brings a systematic approach to concerns of commercialization, standardization, and governance of cloud computing applications. In practice, it leverages the methods and tools of engineering in conceiving, developing, operating and maintaining cloud computing systems and solutions. It is about the process of designing the systems necessary to leverage the power and economics of cloud resources to solve business problems. Core features Cloud engineering is a field of engineering that focuses on cloud services, such as \\"software as a service\\", \\"platform as a service\\", and \\"infrastructure as a service\\". It is a multidisciplinary method encompassing contributions from diverse areas such as systems engineering, software engineering, web engineering, performance engineering, information technology engineering, security engineering, platform engineering, service engineering, risk engineering, and quality engineering. The nature of commodity-like capabilities delivered by cloud services and the inherent challenges in this business model drive the need for cloud engineering as the core discipline. Elements of Cloud Engineering include: * Foundation: the fundamental basics, concepts, guiding principles, and taxonomy * Implementation: the building blocks and practice guides for Cloud realization * Lifecycle: the end-to-end iteration of Cloud development and delivery * Management: the design-time and run-time Cloud management from multiple perspectives =Profession= The professionals who work in the field of cloud engineering are primarily cloud architects and engineers. The key skills possessed by cloud engineering professionals are: * Know the language of business and domain knowledge * Understand the conceptual, logical and physical architecture * Master various cloud technologies, frameworks, and platforms * Implement the solutions for quality of cloud services, e.g. HA, DR, scaling, performance * Work on the security at multiple levels * Develop applications for flexible deployment, provisioning, and management * Leverage open source packages and products * Apply agile and lean principles in design and construction The demand for skills in advanced ICT (Information and Communication Technology) has rapidly expanded in recent years as business and society are being transformed by the emergence of Internet and Web as ubiquitous media for enabling knowledge-based global economy. This in turn has created a huge demand for networked-enabled parallel and distributed computing technologies that are changing the way we conduct science, operate business, and tackle challenging problems such as epidemic diseases and climate change. Software There are many platforms available for cloud engineering, enabling a variety of adaptive environments for architectural framework design, access point sharing, and data retrieval analytics. Platform virtualization is also available, allowing multimodal hypervisor operating system interface relay within the cloud database. History The notion of cloud engineering in the context of cloud computing had been sparsely used in discussions, presentations and talks in various occasions in the middle of the 2000s. The term of cloud engineering was formally coined around 2007 and the concept of cloud engineering was officially introduced in April 2009. Various aspects and topics of this subject have been extensively covered in a number of industry events. Extensive research has been conducted on specific areas in cloud engineering, such as development support for cloud patterns, and cloud business continuity services.

Early life and education Contreras was born in 1962 in Miami, Florida, to Cuban immigrant parents and raised in Miami. He received a Bachelor of Science from Florida State University in 1984 and a Juris Doctor from University of Pennsylvania Law School in 1991. Federal judicial service On July 28, 2011, President Barack Obama nominated Contreras to fill a vacancy on the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to replace Judge Ricardo M. Urbina, who took senior status in 2011. On October 4, 2011, the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on his nomination and on October 3, 2011, reported his nomination to the floor of the Senate. On March 22, 2012, the Senate confirmed Contreras in a voice vote. He received his commission on March 23, 2012.

Notable cases On November 17, 2016, Contreras dismissed a lawsuit against Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell seeking to compel a vote on the Supreme Court nomination of Merrick Garland, finding that the plaintiff, who had simply alleged he was a voter, had no standing to sue. In 2017 Contreras was randomly assigned the case of United States of America v. Michael T. Flynn, the former national security adviser to President Donald Trump. The two-page indictment was released on December 1, 2017. Contreras accepted Flynn's guilty plea to one count of making false statements to the FBI in the course of their investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The guilty plea was part of a plea bargain with the Special Counsel investigation led by Robert S. Mueller III. On December 7, 2017, Contreras was recused from further sentencing hearings scheduled to take place in the future. The case was randomly reassigned to District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan. According to several reputable sources, text messages show that Peter Strzok, a veteran FBI counterintelligence official who worked on the Flynn case as part of Mueller's team, knew Contreras.

It exists to bridge the spectrum of development and humanitarian partners in order to support the Government of Nepal in taking action to implement long-term Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR). The founding members of the NRRC were the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the UN International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (ISDR) and the World Bank. Since 2009, new NRRC members have included AusAid, the Department for International Development (DFID), the Humanitarian Aid Department of the European Commission (ECHO), the embassy of Japan, the US Embassy and the World Health Organization (WHO). The NRRC has developed a Disaster Risk Reduction Action Plan that builds on the GoN National Strategy for Disaster Risk Management (NSDRM). Based on consultations with key stakeholders to identify disaster risk reduction priorities that are urgent and viable, five flagship areas were identified and proposed.

Natural disasters have claimed the lives of more than 27,000 people between 1971 and 2007, indicating an average loss of more than 2 lives per day due to natural disasters. More people are killed by natural disasters in Nepal than any other country in South Asia. In addition to high mortality, more than 50,000 people were reported as injured, 3,000 people missing and about 5 million people affected by natural disasters from 1971-2007.Disaster Risk Reduction in Nepal: Flagship Programmes, The Nepal Risk Reduction Consortium.

Sometimes considered a regional interpretation of the Eastern Shingle Style, it came as a reaction to the classicism of Beaux-Arts architecture. Its characteristics included a link to nature, and use of locally sourced materials such as redwood. It included an emphasis on craftsmanship, volume, form, and asymmetry. The tradition was rooted in San Francisco and the greater Bay Area. The Environmental Design Archives at the University of California, Berkeley house a repository of drawings and specifications associated with the tradition. Joseph Worcester (minister), a minister, mystic, and amateur architect, is believed to have developed the First Bay Tradition in its early stages. The style was later popularized by the architects Bernard Maybeck and Willis Polk. Other architects associated with the tradition included A. Page Brown, Ernest Coxhead, John Galen Howard, Julia Morgan, Louis Christian Mullgardt, and A. C. Schweinfurth. Polk, Maybeck, and Schweinfurth had previously worked in Brown's office. The tradition influenced later styles such as the Modernists of the follow-on Second Bay Tradition. Transitional architects associated with the bridge between these two traditions were Henry Higby Gutterson and John Hudson Thomas.

Pathria is known for his work on superfluidity in liquid helium, Lorentz transformation of thermodynamic quantities, a rigorous evaluation of lattice sums and finite-size effects in phase transitions. Pathria is also the author of a graduate textbook, Statistical Mechanics,Graduate level text book on Statistical Mechanics whose third edition appeared in 2011. He also wrote a book on relativity that has been published in a Dover edition.Dover edition of the book on relativity Early life Pathria was born in a middle-class Punjabi family to parents Ramji Das Pathria and Mela Devi Pathria. He received his early education in a local high school in Ramdas. He then joined the Hindu College. Career Pathria obtained his BSc Honours and MSc Honours degrees from Panjab University, Hoshiarpur in July 1953 and July 1954, respectively, and soon thereafter, at the invitation of Professor F.C. Auluck, joined the graduate school of Physics at the University of Delhi for his doctoral studies ‚Äì which he completed in March 1957. In February 1958, he joined the University of Delhi as a lecturer in physics and in April 1961 got promoted to readership. In August 1964, he left Delhi to take up a visiting professorship at McMaster University in Canada.Men of Education in India (Distinguished Who's Who), Compiled by C L Khosla, Premier Publishers (India), New Delhi, 1965, page 211. Even though his field of research at the University of Delhi was primarily statistical mechanics, Pathria, during that time, got fascinated with the subject of relativity and in 1963, with the friendly cooperation of the Hindustan Publishing Corporation (India), produced a book entitled Theory of Relativity. This maiden attempt at book-writing resulted in fabulous reviews from far and wide, especially from Professor William McCrea ‚Äì who himself was a celebrated author on this subject. In 1974, the Pergamon Press, Oxford produced a second edition of that book and in 2003 Dover Publications of New York took that book under their wings.Dover edition of the book on relativity In Canada, Pathria continued his research in the diverse field of statistical mechanics; at the same time, he gave graduate courses on that subject at McMaster University, Hamilton and the University of Alberta, Edmonton. In 1967, he returned to India to take up professorship of theoretical physics at the Panjab University, Chandigarh, where (apart from conducting research in a variety of subjects in mathematical physics) he continued his mission teaching the fundamentals of statistical mechanics.Panjab University, Chandigarh In 1969, Pathria returned to Canada and, in addition to his other academic pursuits, continued to teach a variety of courses at the University of Waterloo and the University of Windsor. In 1972 the Pergammon Press, Oxford, published his classic text Statistical Mechanics,Graduate level text book on Statistical Mechanics which became an instant success on the international scene. In the early 1990s, when his new publishers (Butterworth-Heinemann) persuaded Pathria to produce a second edition of this text, he sought the help of Surjit Singh, a former student of his from the Chandigarh days (who had also been a postdoctoral fellow with him at Waterloo during 1983‚Äì87). The result of this joint effort was a brand new edition of this book that came out in July 1996 and, like its predecessor, continued to be a bestseller. In between the last two events, Pathria retired from the University of Waterloo in August 1998 and, soon thereafter, moved to the west coast of the US and became an adjunct professor of physics at the University of California at San Diego ‚Äì a position he continues to hold till today. In 2009, Pathria's newest publishers (Elsevier/Academic) prevailed upon him to produce a third edition of this book. He now sought the help of Paul Beale, of the University of Colorado at Boulder, whose co-authorship produced another brand new edition in March 2011.

The Allies, under the tactical direction of Colonel Frederick Adam, were defeated and driven from a strong position at the Ordal defile largely because they failed to post adequate pickets. In an action the next morning at Vilafranca del Pened√®s, the Allied cavalry clashed with the pursuing French horsemen. The actions occurred during the Peninsular War, part of the Napoleonic Wars. Ordal and El Lledoner are located on Highway N-340 between Molins de Rei and Vilafranca. Arthur Wellesley, Marquess of Wellington's triumph at the Battle of Vitoria made Suchet's positions in Valencia and Aragon untenable. Accordingly, the marshal withdrew his soldiers from those two places and concentrated them near Barcelona. As the French withdrew, they were followed up by Bentinck's army of 28,000 Spanish, British, Germans, and Italians. Suchet resolved to strike at Adam's advance guard near Ordal with 12,000 soldiers while Charles Mathieu Isidore Decaen's 7,000 men advanced from the northeast. After Adam's defeat, Bentinck abandoned Vilafranca and fell back to Tarragona. Soon after, he resigned his command. Suchet's victory did not salvage the French position in Catalonia. As his troops were steadily siphoned away to defend eastern France, the marshal was forced to retreat to the Pyrenees, leaving behind several garrisons. These were picked off one by one until only Barcelona remained in French hands at the end of the conflict. Background After the Siege of Valencia ended with a Spanish capitulation on 9 January 1812,Smith, 373 the victorious French army was temporarily halted by the illness of Marshal Louis Gabriel Suchet. The withdrawal of troops for Emperor Napoleon's planned invasion of Russia made additional conquests out of the question.Gates, 325 Suchet, suffering from strategic overstretch, remained fairly quiet that year. On 21 July 1812, one of his division commanders, General of Division Jean Isidore Harispe drubbed General Jos√© O'Donnell's Spanish army at the First Battle of Castalla. This persuaded Thomas Maitland to abandon his amphibious invasion of Catalonia and land his small Anglo-Allied army at Spanish-controlled Alicante instead. That summer and fall, Arthur Wellesley, Marquess Wellington defeated the French at the Battle of Salamanca, captured Madrid, and was subsequently driven back to Portugal after the Siege of Burgos. During these important events Suchet and Maitland remained mostly inactive.Gates, 363-364 Louis Gabriel Suchet After Maitland became ill in September, he was replaced in turn by Generals John Mackenzie, William Henry Clinton, James Campbell, and John Murray, 8th Baronet.Glover, 270 The last-named general repulsed Suchet's attack at the Battle of Castalla on 13 April 1813, but the overcautious Murray withdrew after his victory.Smith, 414 At the prompting of Wellington, Murray mounted a sea-borne attack in June. In the Siege of Tarragona, Murray's timidity caused him to pass up a chance to conquer the weakly defended port. Fearing relief efforts by Suchet and General of Division David-Maurice-Joseph Mathieu de La Redorte, he ordered a hasty retreat, needlessly abandoning 18 heavy siege cannons. Murray was immediately superseded by Lord Bentinck.Glover, 270-275 Wellington's decisive victory at the Battle of Vitoria on 21 June 1813 made it impossible for Suchet to hold onto the provinces of Valencia and Aragon. Severely harassed by Francisco Espoz y Mina's guerillas, General of Brigade Marie Auguste Paris abandoned Saragossa on 10 July and fled over the Pyrenees to France.Gates, 405-406 Suchet evacuated the city of Valencia on 5 JulyMir√≥, Combat of the Ordal Cross and deliberately pulled back to Tarragona, leaving several French garrisons in his wake. Largely untroubled by Bentinck, the French marshal dismantled the fortifications of Tarragona and fell back toward Barcelona. Suchet paused in his retreat at Vilafranca at the end of July. After staying there about one month, the French withdrew to the Llobregat River. Cautiously, Bentick moved forward to occupy the abandoned territory, reaching Vilafranca on 5 September. At length, the British general linked with Francisco Copons y Navia so that he controlled 28,000 troops distributed between Tarragona, Vilafranca del Pened√®s, and Ordal. Battle A map of the Battle of Ordal Holding 10,500 troops at Vilafranca, Bentinck accompanied Frederick Adam's 1,500-man Advanced Guard east to the Ordal Cross heights early on 12 September. This position, which blocked a good road, was well known for its defensive strength. The Spanish army built some field works there, which were largely demolished in 1810. Moving southeast from Sant Sadurni d'Anoia, Colonel Torres arrived at the Ordal heights with 2,300 Spanish troops from General Pedro Sarsfield's division. A cavalry patrol was sent east and found no Frenchmen. Before riding back to Vilafranca, Bentinck assured Adam that the position was secure. Sir Frederick Adam Adam's unit consisted of the 2nd battalion of the 27th Foot, one rifle company each from De Roll's Swiss Regiment and the 4th Line Infantry Battalion of the King's German Legion, one battalion of the Calabrian Free Corps, and four pieces of artillery. Torres commanded the Badajoz, the Tiradores de Cadiz, and Volunteers of Aragon Infantry Regiments.Smith, 453-454 Another source substitutes the Grenadiers of Ultonia for the Badajoz and notes that each Spanish unit had only one battalion each. Adam posted the Calabrian Free Corps on his left flank. Four guns were placed across the highway and supported by the two rifle companies and two companies of the 27th Foot. Torres deployed his men in line to the right of the guns. At the far right, Adam placed the remaining eight companies of the 27th Foot. A group of 150 horsemen waited in the rear; these were from the Brunswick Hussar Regiment. As evening came on, Adam had his men sleep in their battle positions. He neglected his local security by not sending out patrols or picketing the Lledoner bridge, which spanned a deep ravine only in front of the Ordal heights. Lord William Bentinck That evening Suchet started west from Molins de Rei with 12,000 troopsGates, 406-407 in the 2nd Division of Harispe, the 3rd Division of General of Division Pierre-Joseph Habert, and cavalry. Harispe's division was made up of two battalions each of the 7th, 44th, and 116th Line Infantry Regiments. Habert's division comprised two battalions each of the 14th, 16th, and 117th Line Infantry Regiments. Suchet's 1,750-strong cavalry contingent included four squadrons each of the 4th Hussar, 13th Cuirassier, and Westphalian Chevau-l√©ger Regiments, plus three squadrons of the 24th Dragoon Regiment. Historian Digby Smith listed General of Division Andr√© Joseph Boussart as the cavalry division commander and General of Brigade \\"Meyers\\" as his second in command, probably Bernard Meinrad Fridalin Meyer de Schauensee.Broughton, Meyer de Schauensee. This was the only French general named Meyer that was alive in 1813. However, another source states that Boussart died one month earlier.Mulli√©, Boussard, Andre-Joseph Other evidence suggests that General of Brigade Jacques-Antoine-Adrien Delort led Suchet's cavalry at this time.Mulli√©, Delort, Marie-Joseph-RaymondGates, 364. Gates specifies that Jacques-Antoine-Adrien Delort fought at Castalla in 1812.Mulli√© mistakenly puts the biography of Jacques-Antoine-Adrien Delort under Marie- Joseph-Raymond Delort. Confusingly, both were promoted to General of Brigade in 1811 and died in 1846. A second French column under General of Division Charles Mathieu Isidore Decaen that numbered 7,000 men started from Martorell and marched southwest. Like Suchet's column, its goal was to attack Bentinck's force at Vilafranca. The sources do not give the composition of Decaen's force. Suchet left Molins de Rei in the early evening. Marching rapidly, his troops arrived in front of the Ordal position at 11:00 PM. To his amazement, he found that the Allies failed to post any pickets. Suchet hustled his troops across the unguarded bridge and moved them uphill toward the drowsy Allies. As the French troops moved forward, telltale noises aroused the interest of a Spanish cavalry patrol, which trotted forward to see what was happening. These horsemen were greeted by a blast of musketry, which awakened Adam's men. At the front of Harispe's division, General of Brigade Jean Mesclop led the 7th Line to the attack. Halfway up the hill, the 7th Line bumped into an entrenchment held by four Spanish infantry companies. The defenders fell back to a second field work higher up the hillside. After being joined by more Spaniards, these soldiers mounted a counterattack, which briefly pushed back the 7th Line. Charles Decaen Joined by the 44th Line, the 7th Line attacked again and rolled over the Spanish redoubt, killing many of its defenders. Suchet fed troops into the fight, sending Habert's division to the left and placing Harispe's second brigade in support of Mesclop. As the French attack developed, it spread farther and farther to the left to put pressure on the Allied right flank. Thomas Robert Bugeaud, then only a captain in the 116th Line, led his troops across the ravine on a narrow path just to the south of the bridge. This battalion arrived in front of the main body of the 27th Foot. Early in the action, Adam was wounded and handed over command to Colonel Reeves who was later wounded as well. Meanwhile, the Spanish fought well under their commanders, including Colonel Antony Bray of the Tiradores de Cadiz and the Grenadiers under Rafael Larruda. However, the weight of the French attack finally flanked and broke the Anglo-Spanish right. As the allied soldiers fled, Suchet launched Delort in pursuit with the 4th Hussars. The Brunswick Hussars momentarily checked the pursuit, but the 4th Hussars managed to overrun and capture all four British guns which had been withdrawn before the end of the fight. Altogether the 4th Hussars rounded up nearly 500 prisoners. After losing very few men in the action, the Calabrians under Colonel Carey retreated to the northwest. During the night, they ran into the head of Decaen's column and had to quickly reverse course to the south. After passing behind Suchet's advancing column, Carey's men reached the coast where they were taken off by Allied shipping, having lost 51 men. Torres' troops and about 150 men of the 27th Foot made off in the direction of Sant Sadurni and, from there, reached Vilafranca without incident. Result Spanish casualties numbered 87 killed, 239 wounded, and 132 missing. Adam's brigade suffered 75 killed, 109 wounded, and 333 missing. Altogether, the Allies lost 975 men at Ordal. French losses are estimated at about 300. Another authority states that the French lost 270 men and that the 27th Foot alone suffered 360 casualties. A third source reported far heavier French losses, 171 killed and 600 to 700 wounded. After hearing the news of Ordal and finding that Decaen was bearing down on him from the northeast, Bentinck evacuated Vilafranca. On the opposite side of town, he personally deployed his cavalry as a rear guard. His 770 troopers included two squadrons each of the 20th Light Dragoons, Brunswick Hussars, and Sicilian Cavalry Regiments, plus one troop of the Foreign Hussar Regiment. Anglo-Allied losses were 25 killed, 69 wounded, and 40 missing for a total of 134. French casualties numbered 7 officers and 100 men out of 1,750 sabers in four regiments. With this action, Suchet's pursuit ended. Tortosa's fortifications After the battle, Bentinck admitted his defeat in a dispatch to Wellington. He praised the bravery of his British and Spanish soldiers. Then he turned over command to Lieutenant General William Henry Clinton and sailed back to Sicily. After the war, Torres and Bray were decorated for bravery in action. By late 1813, Suchet's forces in Catalonia numbered 46,000 men. His field force included General of Division Louis Fran√ßois F√©lix Musnier's 3,561-man 1st Division, General of Brigade Claude Marie Joseph de Valdotte Pannetier's 3,073-strong 2nd Division, Mathieu's 2,373-man 3rd Division, Habert's 3,975-strong 4th Division, General of Division Jean Maximilien Lamarque's 4,205-man 5th Division, 2,501 cavalry, and 3,000 gunners and others. The French had 9,493 troops in garrisons at Tortosa, Lleida, and Sagunto, 1,605 at Gerona, 1,742 at Figueras, 5,844 at Barcelona, and 4,918 at smaller fortresses.Gates, 527 The new commander, Clinton declined to tangle with the wily Suchet. With no action forthcoming, the Anglo-Allied army in eastern Spain was broken up and sent to reinforce Sicily or Wellington's army. Meanwhile, Suchet was forced to disband his German units as their states abandoned the French alliance. After Napoleon ordered many of his troops away to defend eastern France, Suchet had only 17,000 men left in his field army. He evacuated most of Catalonia except for Barcelona and Figueras. By forging Suchet's signature, a rogue staff officer named Juan Van Halen was able to secure the surrender of 1,900 troops and the fortresses of Lleida, Mequinenza, and Monz√≥n. Only General of Brigade Louis Beno√Æt Robert at Tortosa was not fooled by the trick.Gates, 458-459 Eventually, Suchet was compelled to fall back to the Pyrenees. By April 1814, his army counted only 16,110 troops. Of these, Lamarque's division had 8,491 men in 11 battalions, Mesclop's brigade numbered 3,990 soldiers in seven battalions, the cavalry included 1,449 troopers in seven squadrons, and the artillery had 2,180 artillerists and others to man 24 guns. By the end, the fortified places had all fallen to the Anglo-Spanish except at Barcelona where Habert maintained a fanatical resistance. Weeks after Napoleon abdicated, Habert was finally persuaded to surrender and the last vestige of French occupation finally flickered out.

It is a philosophy of using meals specifically as a means to connect with others: eat to socialize. A brunch, dinner or supper party are popular examples of places to socially gather over food.Adventures In Secret Dining Social dining differs from a dining club in the sense that it is not exclusive, but promotes an inclusive atmosphere. Friends and strangers alike can share the social dining experience. History Social dining dates back to Ancient Greek cuisine when meals would be prepared for the purpose of gathering together during festivals or commemorations. Influence of Technology Technology has made social dining a sharable experience through real-time updates, uploaded images and check-ins (at someone's place or at restaurant). Conversations about meals happen between people present and then are shared with those who are connected to them afar. Websites such as Twitter, Facebook, FourSquare and Gastronaut all encourage people to discuss their dining activities in a virtual, social space. Apps can be downloaded to a user's smartphone to share updates. Some web-based services get people together to share a social meal, even to join local families for a social dining experience while travelling, to truly experience the local culture and culinary. There are also other social dining networks that lets people do group meals at the homes of their users. Another way to experience social dining is by visiting a supper club. Social dining experiences can also be a source of revenue for host that enable them through different kind of website, those can be associated to airbnb business model.  Serial Dining  Serial Dining is a sub-activity within social dining in which the group meets at a location determined by sequential criteria. This choice can be by cuisine, by mention in restaurant guides, or in simple alphabetic order in a telephone directory. An example of the latter is the Serial Diners of Toronto, founded in 1989 by Jason Taniguchi. This sub- activity adds an element of psychogeography in that it combines the normal experience of restaurant visiting with the more random experience of an untried location.

Ross was born in Arlington, Massachusetts on July 18, 1893,Social Security Death Index the third of the five children of Louis Hall Ross and Mable Louisa Rawson. He was the grandson of agriculturalist Warren Winn Rawson and Helen Maria Mair. Graduating from Arlington High School in June 1913, he entered the Massachusetts Agricultural College (presently the University of Massachusetts Amherst) as a pomology major in the fall of that same year.Massachusetts Agricultural College Index, 1918 During his time at the college he was notably active in college sports, having played on the football, baseball, and hockey teams, serving as captain of the latter. He was also a member of the campus \\"mandolin club\\" and the Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity. Ross graduated in 1917, entering the army soon after. He would serve as an infantry lieutenant in the 166th Regiment of the 42nd Infantry Division, better known as the \\"Rainbow Division\\", in France during the First World War. By the end of the war he had been awarded a Purple Heart with an oak leaf cluster. After the war, Ross entered the Harvard Graduate School of Architecture in 1921, graduating four years later in 1925. He would spend the next ten years working as a draftsman for prominent Boston architect, Edward T. P. Graham before starting his own firm in 1935. One of his first independent projects, Thatcher House, was designed for his alma mater as the first dorm of the Northeast Residential Complex and the oldest dormitory still in use on campus today. His first design was seen as such a success by the university (by this time known as Massachusetts State College) that he was given a gold medal at the 1938 commencement for his design and oversight of the building's construction.Massachusetts State College Index, 1938 This would be the first of over 20 dormitories that he would design for the university, among other buildings. Although not as widely known as his campus work, Ross would also design a variety of buildings in the towns of Amherst, Northampton]{, Winchester, Needham and Newton]{. Ross moved to Newton in the early 1920s where he met Dorothy M. Pickett; the couple were wed on October 8, 1928. They had two children, a son, Warren R. Ross, and a daughter, Sally L. Pestalozzi. In the last 10 years of his life Ross spent his summers in Rockport, and continued his work up until the age of 72, only a year prior to his death. After what was described as \\"a brief illness\\", Louis Warren Ross died on Thursday, September 8, 1966. Although his namesake is confined to the Builder's Association plaques of the many university buildings, never before, or since, has the Amherst campus been shaped so thoroughly by any single individual as Ross had done in his 30 years of service to the institution. It may be said that entire sections of the campus, encompass his legacy.

The company's headquarters, hatchery and processing facility are located in Mifflintown, Pennsylvania. History =Early years= Empire Kosher was founded in 1938 in Liberty, New York by Joseph N. Katz, an Austrian-Jewish immigrant to the United States. The Katz family, including Joseph's son Murray, owned and ran the business for the first five decades of operation.Popper, Nathaniel, \\"Empire Strikes Back\\", The Forward, August 12, 2009.The New York Times, \\"Weddings: Faith T. Mervis, Alan L. Katz\\", The New York Times, June 9, 1996. In the 1930s and 1940s, the Katz family recruited the rabbis required for the kosher production process from Mandatory Palestine as well as Jewish communities in Europe, and the company initially operated out of a garage in Liberty, New York. (The company's name comes from the nickname for New York State.Empire Kosher, \\"History\\", Empire Kosher Poultry, Inc.) In the 1950s, Empire became known as an innovator in kosher food production.Kosher Eye, \\"Empire Kosher Poultry: Ruling the Roost\\", Kosher Eye, November 2010. =Relocation and expansion= Early in the 1960s, while still owned by the Katz family, the company relocated to Mifflintown, Pennsylvania, approximately 40 miles outside of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, where it is still headquartered today. Katz purchased a processing plant in Mifflintown, and expanded production in order to meet the demand provided by the growing Jewish middle class. Empire became the first kosher food company to move into mainstream supermarket distribution. =Competition and debt= In 1986, a fire destroyed the production line at the Mifflintown plant, and the Katz family invested nearly $20 million to rebuild and modernize the plant. In 1992, Empire was sold to private equity firm Apollo Management, and several years later sold to another private equity firm, J.W. Childs Associates, and the company carried a high debt burden. =Investment and growth= In 2003, Empire was purchased by a consortium of private investors led by Greg Rosenbaum. The company modernized and expanded its plant and production line, more than doubling production capacity by 2009.Failed Messiah, \\"Empire Doubles Production\\", Failed Messiah, July 3, 2009. Empire currently processes 240,000 chickens and 27,000 turkeys per week, with annual revenue over $100 million, making it the largest U.S. producer of kosher poultry.

The rabbis live in on-site dormitories during the week, and the plant has its own mikvah and shul. Empire poultry is raised, slaughtered and processed in accordance with the rules of kashrut, and is certified by the Orthodox Union and Rabbi Yechiel Babad, Tartikov Rav. Until recently, KAJ from Washington Heights NY, have been one of the main Kosher supervisors on most Empire Products. KAJ pulled its Rabbinic supervision not willing to share the kashrus responsibility with an additional hechsher. As part of the kosher production process, salt is used to cleanse blood from the animal. A result of this is that kosher poultry is preferred by some non- kosher consumers for the alleged \\"juiciness\\" provided by this brining.Severson, Kim, \\"For Some, 'Kosher' Equals Pure\\", New York Times, Jan. 12, 2010.

It was first described as a new species by William Hilton in 1930 when he found it at Balboa Bay in Newport Beach, California.Hilton, W. A. (1930). A new Phoronopsis from California. Transactions of the American Microscopical Society 49(2) 154-59. Description P. californica lives in a stiff tube encrusted with sand and embedded in sandy or muddy sediment. The tube is up to 250 millimetres long, 3 millimetres wide at the open end and twice this diameter in the middle. There is a bulge at the other end, which is sealed. At the collar, just below the lophophore or feeding organ, the worm has the marked involution of the epidermis which distinguishes the genus Phoronopsis. When the worm is extended it can reach 450 millimetres in length with a diameter of up to 5 millimetres. The colour varies but is usually orangish-brown with a red, orange or green lophophore. This organ has about 1,500 tentacles, each some 2.5 millimetres long, arranged in a pair of helicoid whorls with four to seven coils. These project from the seabed and are the only part of the animal normally visible. They can be retracted back into the tube if danger threatens or when the animal is no longer submerged.Paleopolois Distribution and habitat P. californica occurs in shallow coastal waters in California and in temperate European waters near Spain, Portugal and Madeira. It lives singly and builds its tube in soft sediments varying from mud to coarse sand. It is found on the lower shore and in the neritic zone down to a depth of thirty metres. In the Mediterranean Sea it is found growing in association with the sea grass, Cymodocea nodosa.Occurrence of Phoronopsis californica and Phoronis australis at Granada Coast (Spain, western Mediterranean) Biology P. californica is a filter feeder. Numerous cilia on the tentacles create a current which brings food particles within reach. These then get trapped in mucus and moved towards the mouth. At the same time, the tentacles act as gills for gas exchange.The Phoronida Individual worms are either male or female but little is known of the process of reproduction in this species and the larval form, Actinotrocha californica, has not yet been identified.Emig, C.C.; Rold√°n, C.; Vi√©itez, J.M.

A chromatin domain with constitutive S/MARs at its termini (I). When functional demands require the specific translocation of the constituent gene to the matrix, facultative S/MARs responds to topological changes which are initiated by the association of transcription factors (TF) and supported by histone acetylation. Topological changes are propagated once the gene is pulled through the transcriptional machinery (II). Transcription is terminated (III) followed by dissociation of the transcription complex (IV) The term S/MAR (scaffold/matrix attachment region), otherwise called SAR (scaffold-attachment region), or MAR (matrix-associated region), are sequences in the DNA of eukaryotic chromosomes where the nuclear matrix attaches. As architectural DNA components that organize the genome of eukaryotes into functional units within the cell nucleus, S/MARs mediate structural organization of the chromatin within the nucleus. These elements constitute anchor points of the DNA for the chromatin scaffold and serve to organize the chromatin into structural domains. Studies on individual genes led to the conclusion that the dynamic and complex organization of the chromatin mediated by S/MAR elements plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression. Overview It has been known for many years that a polymer meshwork, a so-called \\"nuclear matrix\\" or \\"nuclear- scaffold\\" is an essential component of eukaryotic nuclei. This nuclear skeleton acts as a dynamic support for many specialized events concerning the readout a spread of genetic information (see below). S/MARs map to non-random locations in the genome. They occur at the flanks of transcribed regions, in 5¬¥-introns, and also at gene breakpoint cluster regions (BCRs). Being association points for common nuclear structural proteins S/MARs are required for authentic and efficient chromosomal replication and transcription, for recombination and chromosome condensation. S/MARs do not have an obvious consensus sequence. Although prototype elements consist of AT-rich regions several hundred base pairs in length, the overall base composition is definitely not the primary determinant of their activity. Instead, their function requires a pattern of \\"AT-patches\\" that confer the propensity for local strand unpairing under torsional strain. Bioinformatics approaches support the idea that, by these properties, S/MARs not only separate a given transcriptional unit (chromatin domain) from its neighbors, but also provide platforms for the assembly of factors enabling transcriptional events within a given domain. An increased propensity to separate the DNA strands (the so- called 'stress induced duplex destabilization' potential, SIDD) can serve the formation of secondary structures such as cruciforms or slippage structures, which are recognizable features for a number of enzymes (DNAses, topoisomerases, poly(ADP-ribosyl) polymerases and enzymes of the histone- acetylation and DNA-methylation apparatus). S/MARs have been classified as either being constitutive (acting as permanent domain boundaries in all cell types) or facultative (cell type- and activity-related) depending on their dynamic properties. While the number of S/MARs in the human genome has been estimated to approach 64,000 (chromatin domains) plus an additional 10,000 (replication foci), in 2007 still only a minor fraction (559 for all eukaryotes) had met the standard criteria for an annotation in the S/MARt database SMARtDB. Context-dependent properties Current views of the nuclear matrix envision it as a dynamic entity, which changes its properties along the requirements of the cell nucleus‚Äîmuch the same as the cytoskeleton adapts its structure and function to external signals. In retrospect it is of note that the discovery of S/MARs has two major routes: * the description of scaffold-attachment elements (SARs) by Laemmli and coworkers, which were thought to demarcate the borders of a given chromatin domain * the characterization of matrix-associated regions (MARs) the first examples of which supported the immunoglobulin kapp-chain enhancer according to its occupancy with transcription factors Subsequent work demonstrated both the constitutive (SAR-like) and the facultative (MAR-like) function of the elements depending on the context. Whereas constitutive S/MARs were found to be associated with a DNase I hypersensitive site in 'all' cell types (whether or not the enclosed domain was transcribed), DNAse I hypersensitivity of the facultative type depended on the transcriptional status. The major difference between these two functional types of S/MARs is their size: the constitutive elements may extend over several kilobasepairs whereas facultative ones are at the lower size limit around 300 base pairs. The figure shows our present understanding of these properties and it incorporates the following findings: * the dynamic properties of S/MAR-scaffold contacts as derived by haloFISH investigations * the fact that during transcription DNA is reeled through RNA- polymerase which itself is a fixed component of the nuclear matrix * the fact that certain domain-intrinsic S/MARs require the support of an adjacent transcription factor to become active. Additional information Recently, Tetko has found a strong correlation of intragenic S/MARs with spatiotemporal expression of genes in Arabidopsis thaliana.See Tetko, Igor V., Georg Haberer, Stephen Rudd, Blake Meyers, Hans-Werner Mewes, and Klaus F. X. Mayer (2006) Spatiotemporal Expression Control Correlates with Intragenic Scaffold Matrix Attachment Regions (S/MARs) in Arabidopsis thaliana. PLoS Computational Biology 2:136-145. Online copy. On a genome scale, pronounced tissue- and organ-specific and developmental expression patterns of S/MAR-containing genes have been detected. Notably, transcription factor genes contain a significant higher portion of S/MARs. The pronounced difference in expression characteristics of S/MAR-containing genes emphasizes their functional importance and the importance of structural chromosomal characteristics for gene regulation in plants as well as within other eukaryotes.

Operating under the call sign VK2MBACMA License registry Accessed 16 August 2011 the society boasts members from a wide range of backgrounds, with members ranging from retirees to school children.  History  The Manly-Warringah Radio Society can trace its roots back to 1923, when it was formed as the Manly Radio Club, callsign 2YE and then VK2MR. Initially the society held meetings at the home of a club member in Fairlight until the club outgrew the premises and was forced to move to the garage of a club member in Condamine St Balgowlah. In 1935 a large house became available in Darley Rd Manly, which was used as the club house until it was partially destroyed in 1936. Following the destruction of the clubhouse in Manly the club had use of a Navy owned room near Manly Baths, and were able to string antennas between the roof of the building and nearby trees. This building was used until 1939 when the Navy required the space for training. Manly Radio Club was disbanded with the assets of the radio club being disbursed amongst the current members at the time. The Society reformed in 1976, where it moved to various buildings around the Northern Beaches of Sydney as space became available; Hinkler Park North Manly, Harbord Diggers (meetings only), Warringah Mall, and the Society eventually settled in 1984 at the Volunteer Services Centre site in Terrey Hills where it remained until 2009 where once again it was forced to move, by SES expansion, to the Girl Guides Hall in Terrey Hills.  Club meetings  Society meetings are held every Wednesday evening from 7.30 p.m. at the Terrey Hills Guides Hall, Beltana Avenue, Terrey Hills.  Volunteer work  The society will often provide communications for sporting events and during times of natural disasters. Notably, members of the Society helped operate the ground control station for Dick Smith's record-breaking hot-air balloon flight across Australia in 1993. The club hosts the annual Scouting JOTA jamboree radio activities and has regular Cub Scout evenings (by appointment); One of the many skills taught is using the NATO Phonetic Alphabet when making contacts on HF Radio. Training and licensing The Manly-Warringah Radio Society provides training and examination services to the amateur radio community on behalf of the Wireless Institute of Australia. One of the society's goals is to enable people to become licensed amateur radio operators by holding regular training and examination days at the clubhouse. International Lighthouse and Lightship Weekend Each year the Manly- Warringah Radio Society celebrate International Lighthouse and Lightship Weekend by activating an amateur radio station at the Barrenjoey lighthouse. The goal of the weekend is \\"to promote public awareness of lighthouses and lightships and their need for preservation and restoration, to promote amateur radio and to foster International goodwill\\". Over the course of the weekend some of the over 400 radio-active lighthouses around the world will be contacted from headland, usually on HF frequencies.  Repeaters  The club owns and operates amateur radio repeaters on numerous frequencies and modes. On the 2 meter band the repeater can be operated on 146.875 MHz FM output / 146.275 MHz input while on 70 cm the repeater can be operated on 438.175 MHz FM output / 433.175 MHz input using a 91.5 Hz CTCSS tone, or in APCO P25 mode using the standard NAC of 0x293.

Provincial lords gained power as the increasingly dysfunctional dual system of government eventually collapsed amid civil war. The victorious Penlop of Trongsa Ugyen Wangchuck gained de jure sovereignty over the entire realm in 1907, marking the establishment of the modern Kingdom of Bhutan and the ascendancy of the House of Wangchuck. Since this time, the provinces of Bhutan have been reorganized several times into what are now the twenty Districts of Bhutan (Dzongkhag). Provincial titles such as Penlop of Trongsa and Penlop of Paro carry on, however, wholly subordinate to the Royal House. Traditionally, Bhutan comprised nine provinces: Trongsa, Paro, Punakha, Wangdue Phodrang, Daga (also Taka, Tarka, or Taga), Bumthang, Thimphu, Kurtoed (also Kurtoi, Kuru-tod), and Kurmaed (or Kurme, Kuru-mad). The Provinces of Kurtoed and Kurmaed were combined into one local administration, leaving the traditional number of governors at eight. While some lords were Penlops, others held the title Dzongpen (Dzongkha: ‡Ω¢‡æó‡Ωº‡ΩÑ‡ºã‡Ωë‡Ωî‡Ωº‡Ωì‡ºã; Wylie: rjong-dpon; also \\"Jongpen,\\" \\"Dzongp√∂n\\"); both titles may be translated as \\"governor.\\" History Paro Dzong, administrative headquarters of historical Paro Province Ugyen Wangchuck surrounded by his councillors at Punakha, Bhutan, 1905. Front Row: son of Thimphu Jongpen, Punakha Jongpen, Thimphu Jongpen, Trongsa Penlop, Zung Donyer [dronyer], Deb Zimpon, and elder son of Thimphu Jongpen. Under Bhutan's early theocratic dual system of government, decreasingly effective central government control resulted in the de facto disintegration of the office of Shabdrung after the death of Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal in 1651. Under this system, the Shabdrung reigned over the temporal Druk Desi and religious Je Khenpo. Two successor Shabdrungs ‚Äì the son (1651) and stepbrother (1680) of Ngawang Namgyal ‚Äì were effectively controlled by the Druk Desi and Je Khenpo until power was further splintered through the innovation of multiple Shabdrung incarnations, reflecting speech, mind, and body. Increasingly secular regional lords (penlops and dzongpons) competed for power amid a backdrop of civil war over the Shabdrung and invasions from Tibet, and the Mongol Empire. The penlops of Trongsa and Paro, and the dzongpons of Punakha, Thimphu, and Wangdue Phodrang were particularly notable figures in the competition for regional dominance. During this period, there were a total of nine provinces and eight penlops vying for power. The Penlop of Paro controlled western Bhutan; the rival Penlop of Trongsa controlled eastern Bhutan; and dzongpons controlled areas surrounding their respective dzongs. The Penlop of Paro, unlike Trongsa, was an office appointed by the Druk Desi's central government. Because western regions controlled by the Penlop of Paro contained lucrative trade routes and the most fertile agricultural lands, it became the object of competition among aristocratic families. The 10th Penlop of Trongsa Jigme Namgyel (r. 1853‚Äì1870) began consolidating power, paving the way for his son the 12th Penlop of Trongsa (and 21st Penlop of Paro) Ugyen Wangchuck to prevail in battle against all rival penlops and establish the monarchy in 1907. With the establishment of the monarchy and consolidation of power, the traditional roles of provinces, their rulers, and the dual system of government came to an end.
