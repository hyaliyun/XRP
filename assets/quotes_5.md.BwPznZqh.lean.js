Resolution Observations In the preamble of the resolution, the Council recognised the successful holding of elections in Burundi between May and September 2010 and encouraged the government to create space for all political parties. It was further encouraged by the government's anti-corruption policy and progress towards peace and stability. The Council welcomed the engagement of the Peacebuilding Commission in Burundi, and the latter's commitment to regional integration within the Economic Community of the Great Lakes Countries and East African Community. The resolution also expressed concern at human rights violations, including extrajudicial killings, torture and restrictions on civil liberties. Acts The Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon was asked to establish BNUB to support peace, stability and national reconciliation in Burundi. It would be headed by a Special Representative of the Secretary- General, and undertake the following tasks: :(a) support the development of national institutions; :(b) promoting dialogue; :(c) combating impunity; :(d) promoting human rights; :(e) ensuring economic and financial policies meet the needs of vulnerable people and advocate resource mobilisation for Burundi; :(f) support with regional integration issues. The Council emphasised the primary responsibility of the Burundian government for peacebuilding and long- term development and encouraged more efforts to improve governance and tackle corruption. It was also important to address security sector reform and the reintegration of former child soldiers. Meanwhile, a tripartite agreement between Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees concerning refugees was welcomed.

Her debut single from early 1964, \\"Don't You Know Yockomo?\\", achieved No. 1 chart success in New Zealand and in the Australian cities of Brisbane and Melbourne. It was followed in September by her cover version of Jackie Wilson's, \\"Reet Petite\\", which also reached No. 1 in New Zealand and peaked at No. 6 in Melbourne. The Australian release was a double A-sided single with \\"Do the Blue Beat\\". On her early singles she was backed by fellow New Zealanders, Max Merritt & His Meteors. Lee appeared regularly on both New Zealand and Australian TV variety programs, including Sing, Sing, Sing and Bandstand. She toured supporting Johnny O'Keefe, Ray Columbus & the Invaders and P.J. Proby. According to Australian rock music journalist, Ed Nimmervoll, in the 1960s, \\"Lee was the most successful female singer of in both her New Zealand homeland and Australia ... on stage and on record Dinah had all the adventure and exuberance for the time the boys had\\". Early life Dinah Lee was born as Diane Marie Jacobs on 19 August 1943 in Waimate, New Zealand. After her parents separated, she was fostered by a family near Christchurch where she attended Cashmere High School. Her father was a saxophonist, who worked selling carpets in a Christchurch department store and, part-time, ran a teen dance club ‚Äì The Country Club Cabaret. In 1958, Lee was asked to sing at the club on Saturdays and became popular with local patrons. As a 15-year-old, she had her first professional gig with Bobby Davis & the Dazzlers in a small hall and they later worked in a coffee lounge. In 1962, Lee was working with Christchurch group, Saints, and dating their guitarist and vocalist, Phil Garland. By year's end Saints had split and Lee and Garland formed The Playboys with Mark Graham on guitar, Brian Ringrose (ex-Ray Columbus & the Invaders) on guitar, Dave Martin on guitar and Graeme Miller on drums. They relocated to Auckland for a residency at Top 20 Club, Lee shared lead vocals with Garland, one of her covers was Huey \\"Piano\\" Smith's \\"Don't You Know Yockomo?\\" popularised by American R&B; artist Dee Dee Sharp. Playboys returned to Christchurch, but by 1963, Lee returned to Auckland to pursue her solo career, she supported gigs by Max Merritt & His Meteors or Ray Columbus & the Invaders. Playboys recruited Graeme's brother Dave on vocals and later became The Dave Miller Set in Sydney. Lee adopted the latest Mod fashions following advice from boutique owner, Jackie Holme ‚Äì a page boy haircut, white make-up, op-art clothes and white boots. After being recommended by Merritt, she joined the Startime Spectacular Tour of North Island which was headlined by Bill & Boyd and Max Merritt & His Meteors ‚Äì Merritt's band backed her during her set. Her performances were more animated and energetic than typically demure female pop artists. Lee was heckled at some regional venues and her mother was unable to recognise her when catching up at an airport. Tour organiser, James Haddleton, became her manager and she was signed with Viking Records, an independent label based in Wellington and she was promoted as 'Queen of the Mods'. New Zealand hits Dinah Lee's debut single, \\"Don't You Know Yockomo?\\", was released in August 1964 ‚Äì under the name Diane Lee, chosen by Viking ‚Äì and peaked at No. 1 in New Zealand. Viking used Merritt's band to back her in the studio and after the first pressings had sold out, Viking changed the attribution to Dinah Lee. Ray Columbus & the Invaders' single, \\"She's a Mod\\" became the first by a New Zealand act to reach No. 1 on an Australian chart. Only weeks later, Lee's single, \\"Don't You Know Yockomo?\\" was issued there by EMI on their HMV label and reached No. 1 in Brisbane and Melbourne. Lee's second single, \\"Reet Petite\\" was a cover of Jackie Wilson's hit and had also been recorded with Merritt's band, when released in September it reached No. 1 in New Zealand. Her third single, Ray Rivera's \\"Do the Blue Beat\\", followed in October in New Zealand. \\"Reet Petitie\\" and \\"Do the Blue Beat\\" were issued as a double A-sided single in Australia and reached No. 3 in Adelaide and No. 6 in Melbourne. Lee toured New Zealand and Australia on Starlift '64, promoted by Harry M. Miller, with a bill headed by The Searchers, Peter and Gordon and Del Shannon. Backing Lee at some gigs were Ray Columbus & the Invaders and, in Sydney, a newly formed group ‚Äì The Easybeats. With \\"Reet Petite\\" charting in Australia, rock'n'roller Johnny O'Keefe invited Lee to appear on his television series, Sing, Sing, Sing and join his Sydney club shows. Upon return to Auckland, Lee issued her fourth Viking single, \\"Who Stole the Sugar?\\" in November. She featured on two half-hour specials on New Zealand TV, while \\"I'm Walking\\" was issued as her next Australian single by HMV. By year's end, Viking had also released two extended plays, Don't You Know... and Yeah, Yeah We Love Them All and her debut album, Introducing Dinah Lee. In early 1965, Lee appeared on Australian TV shows, Bandstand and Saturday Date. One of her Bandstand performances was at Myer Music Bowl with headlining Jamaican Blue beat singer Millie Small. Lee travelled to the United States to appear on Shindig! ‚Äì she sang with Glen Campbell ‚Äì and on other TV shows. Lee then went to the United Kingdom where she released, \\"I'll Forgive You Then Forget You\\" on Island Records' label Aladdin. In August‚ÄìSeptember, Lee toured New Zealand and Australia with US pop sensation, P.J. Proby ‚Äì noted for splitting his pants on stage in the UK in February ‚Äì who had been banned by the BBC. In Australia, HMV released \\"Let Me In\\" to coincide with the tour. Lee won 'Entertainer of the Year' at New Zealand's inaugural NEBOA Awards in late September ‚Äì soon after she decided to base herself in Australia. Late in the year, Viking released a string of singles, \\"He Can't Do the Blue Beat\\", \\"Nitty Gritty\\" and \\"That's it I Quit\\", in New Zealand. In November, they released her second studio album, The Sound of Dinah Lee. Later career Late in 1965, Dinah Lee relocated to Sydney and in March 1966 she undertook a second tour with Small. Lee's next single was \\"He Don't Want Your Love Anymore\\" but her chart success had begun to decline. On 29 June 1966, Australian teen newspaper, Go-Set published \\"The Dinah Lee Story\\" and she appeared on their front cover. Her public popularity was still high ‚Äì she was voted No. 2 'Female Vocal' in Go-Set's pop poll in October and was in the top 5 for 1967 and 1968. Lee continued to release singles in 1966, she toured with Proby in September‚ÄìOctober and followed with a third studio album, The Mod World of Dinah Lee late that year. In April 1967, she became the 'face' for Yardley Cosmetics' commercials on Australian TV. Her July single for Viking and HMV was \\"Sorry Mama\\" but neither company renewed her contract. Lee spent most of the late 1960s on the night club circuit with occasional variety TV appearances. Lee successfully sued her former manager, Haddleton, for money owed and re-took control of her financial interests. According to Australia rock music journalist, Ed Nimmervoll, in the 1960s, \\"Lee was the most successful female singer of in both her New Zealand homeland and Australia ... on stage and on record Dinah had all the adventure and exuberance for the time the boys had.\\" Lee entertained troops in Vietnam in the late 1960s on Australian Broadcasting Commission-sponsored tours (under her birth name, Diane Jacobs) and was awarded the Vietnam Logistic and Support Medal. In the 1970s, she continued to release singles including \\"Tell Him\\" in 1972 on Polydor. In 1974, she joined O'Keefe on his comeback show, The Good Old Days of Rock'n'Roll, at St. George's Leagues Club. Her next single, \\"It Doesn't Matter Anymore\\" appeared in 1976 on Festival Records. \\"I Can See Clearly Now\\" was released in 1979 on Laser Records. In 1982, a compilation, Best of Dinah Lee was issued on Music World. By 1984, she had become involved in body building winning the 'Australian Female Body Builder of the Year' in the over 35s category. In the 1990s and 2000s, Lee continued performing on the club circuit and became a motivational speaker. ABC-TV series, Long Way to the Top, was broadcast in August 2001. Lee featured on \\"Episode 2: Ten Pound Rocker 1963‚Äì1968\\" where she discussed the mod look and her appeal to rebellious teens, \\"I had this image and it wasn't cute and pretty\\". The TV series inspired the Long Way to the Top national concert tour during August‚ÄìSeptember 2002, which featured a host of the best Australian acts of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. Lee's performances of \\"Yokomo\\" and \\"Reet Petite\\" at the final Sydney concert, as well as an interview with promoter, Michael Chugg, feature on the associated DVD, Long Way to the Top: Live in Concert released in 2002. Honours  On 24 March 2007, Lee was inducted into the RockoNZ Rock Hall of Fame, alongside fellow New Zealanders Ray Columbus and Max Merritt. She released a new album, Islands in 2006 on Waterfront Records. As from December 2010, Lee is a board member of Phonographic Performance Company of Australia.

He wrestled for WCW from 1992 until 2000. Career Walker made his professional debut in 1989. Wrestling as Hurricane Walker in 1990, he challenged for the NWA Florida Tag Team Championship; teaming with Brian Knobbs, he competed for the vacant title against Robert Fuller and Kendall Windham but was unable to win the title. When it was vacated again, he paired with Joe Gomez in another unsuccessful attempt to win the championship. He and Tim Parker won the championship belts in late 1990 by defeating Sgt. Rock and Mark Starr but soon dropped the title to Sgt. Rock and Ron Slinker. Walker made brief appearances with Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling in July 1991, the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in November 1991, and the International Championship Wrestling Alliance in 1992. In 1991, he was rated number 354 in Pro Wrestling Illustrateds annual ranking of the top 500 wrestlers in the world; the following year, he was ranked at number 365. He later trained at the WCW Power Plant, a training facility operated by WCW. He made his WCW debut in 1992 under the name Robbie Walker. Originally he was scheduled to team with Ron Simmons at the Clash of the Champions XXI against Cactus Jack, Tony Atlas, and The Barbarian in a handicap match, but was injured and was replaced by the debuting 2 Cold Scorpio. After nearly a year recovering and working house shows for WCW, he returned under the name Bobby Walker and appeared in a televised match as part of a tag team with Jason Johnson in a loss to Harlem Heat on the January 8, 1994, episode of WCW Saturday Night. Managed by Teddy Long, Walker competed as a jobber to the stars in WCW. Walker lost the majority of his matches but won occasional bouts against lower-level wrestlers. He wrestled his only pay-per-view match at WCW's first World War 3 event. He competed in a three-ring, sixty-wrestler battle royal, which was won by Randy Savage. In 1996, Walker was chosen to team with The Barbarian at Slamboree 1996 for the Lethal Lottery, but after he was injured by Lex Luger on a WCW Saturday Night, Walker was replaced by the returning Diamond Dallas Page, who would eventually win the battle royal. Walker later wrestled in a dark match prior to Bash at the Beach 1996, in which he defeated Billy Kidman. The following month, he teamed with Mr. J.L. for a dark match prior to Clash of the Champions XXXIII; they were defeated by The Nasty Boys. He continued to appear with the company until 2000. Personal life Walker is the nephew of retired professional wrestler Thunderbolt Patterson. In 2000, Walker, Sonny Onoo, Hardbody Harrison, and several other performers filed a lawsuit against WCW, alleging racial discrimination. Walker stated that his Caucasian opponents were told to make him look bad and that he was told that he would never hold a championship belt. He also stated that he was paid less than many of the company's Caucasian wrestlers. The suit also stated that African American wrestlers were made to look \\"loud, obnoxious, pompous and shiftless\\". On April 3, 2001, a judge ruled that WCW had not committed fraud or breached the contracts of the plaintiffs. He also ruled that the discrimination lawsuit could proceed. Because the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), now World Wrestling Entertainment, had purchased WCW after the lawsuit was filed, Walker's lawyer stated that the plaintiffs would pursue legal action against the WWF. The lawsuit was eventually settled out of court; sources report Harrison received a large payout.

Ward taught school in Edna starting in 1890 and married her first husband Albert Malsch a year later. The family moved to Houston in 1903, where Ward worked as a court reporter. Hortense and Albert divorced in 1906 and she married her second husband, attorney William Henry Ward two years later. Ward became the first woman to pass the Texas State Bar Exam in 1910 and soon after began practicing law with her husband. Ward chose to work behind the scenes rather than in court out of fear that all-male juries might react poorly to a female lawyer. In 1915, Ward became the first Texas woman to practice before the United States Supreme Court. Ward was also a founder of the Houston Heights Woman's Club, which is still in existence today. Every year the club gives an award honoring her to a woman who is a law student that exemplifies the spirit of public service exhibited by Ward. Ward was a prominent campaigner for women's suffrage and women's rights. She wrote pamphlets and newspaper articles and personally exhorted elected officials to vote for bills promoting women's legal rights. Ward led a successful 1918 campaign to allow women the right to vote in Texas primary elections and, on June 27 of that year, she became the first woman in Harris County, Texas to register to vote. Ward was appointed Special Chief Justice of a special all- female Texas Supreme Court in 1925. All of the court's male justices recused themselves from a case involving the Woodmen of the World fraternal organization, and, since nearly every member of the Texas Bar was a member of that organization and received insurance benefits from it, no male judges or attorneys could be found to hear the case. After ten months of searching for suitable male replacements, Governor Pat Neff decided to appoint a special court composed of three women to decide the case. This court, consisting of Ward, Hattie Leah Henenberg, and Ruth Virginia Brazzil, met for five months and ultimately ruled in favor of Woodmen of the World. Ward died in Houston on December 5, 1944.

The modern Blue Nile river cuts across part of the sedimentary basin. Strata The Blue Nile basin originated in an area of Neoproterozoic rocks aged about 750 Ma that had become a peneplain, possibly during the Paleozoic era (540‚Äì250 MaMa = Million years ago). The basin was formed due to rifting during the Mesozoic era (250‚Äì66 Ma). Between the Triassic and early Jurassic, about 300 m of fluvial sediments were deposited by rivers and streams. During the Jurassic (200‚Äì145 Ma) the basin was twice covered by an arm of the Indian Ocean for extended periods, creating a lower limestone sediment 450 m thick and an upper limestone sediment 400 m thick. In the late Jurassic and early Cretaceous periods the basin rose, and the 280 m upper sandstone sediments, both alluvial or fluvial, were deposited. In total, about 1.4 km of sediment was deposited over the basement rocks in this period. Later, the Afar mantle plume caused volcanic eruptions in the early and late Oligocene (34‚Äì23 Ma), depositing volcanic rocks between 500 m and 2000 m thick, with further eruptions in the Quaternary depositing another 300 m of rock. These layers have been exposed where the Blue Nile river has cut through the strata, creating a 1,600 m gorge where the rocks of different periods can be studied. However, the architecture of the basin is not well known in other areas due to the thick upper layer of comparatively recent volcanic rock. Rifting The NW trending rift basin originated when the basement rocks were extended between the Triassic and early Cretaceous periods through forces related to the rifting of Gondwana. As the Blue Nile basin formed, it was filled with clastic and marine sediments. In the late Miocene further rifting occurred in a NW-SE extension associated with the Main Ethiopian rift, which formed NE-trending faults. In the Quaternary (2.5 Ma - present) the region was subject to further stresses as the Main Ethiopian rift opened obliquely, creating N, ESE and NW trending extensions within the basin. Other rift basins with the same orientation formed in the region at the same time. The Blue Nile rift, Melut Basin and Muglad Basin all terminate on the line of the Central African Shear Zone, a major strike-slip shear zone. It is now known that the Muglad and Melut connect in the southeast, and then connect to the Anza trough in Kenya. It is possible that the Blue Nile basin may be a southeastern extension of the Blue Nile rift in the Sudan, and may also extend southeast of the Main Ethiopian rift, connecting to the Ogaden Basin in southeast Ethiopia.

Function  The origin recognition complex (ORC) is a highly conserved six subunits protein complex essential for the initiation of the DNA replication in eukaryotic cells. Studies in yeast demonstrated that ORC binds specifically to origins of replication and serves as a platform for the assembly of the pre-replication complex, which includes additional initiation factors such as Cdc6 and Mcm proteins. The protein encoded by this gene is the largest subunit of the origin recognition complex. While other ORC subunits are stable throughout the cell cycle, the levels of this protein vary during the cell cycle, which has been shown to be controlled by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis after initiation of DNA replication. This protein is found to be selectively phosphorylated during mitosis. It is also reported to interact with MYST histone acetyltransferase 2 (MYST2/HBO1), a protein involved in control of transcription silencing.

The AGT Division was headquartered in Kansas City, Missouri, where it remained in operation until 1960 when Westinghouse decided to focus on industrial and electric utility gas turbines. History A concise history of Westinghouse jet engine development may be found in the ASME technical paper entitled \\"Evolution of Heavy-Duty Power Generation and Industrial Gas Turbines in the United States‚Äù ( see references) delivered at the ASME International Gas Turbine Conference, The Hague, June, 1994. This paper was compiled by Westinghouse engineers who had direct personal experience or close personal connections with the subject. The following summary is gleaned from that paper as well as from the Tommy Thomason reference also cited. In March, 1943, the first US designed and manufactured jet engine went on test at Westinghouse, 15 months after the signing of a contract with the U.S. Navy Bureau of Aeronautics. This first engine, with a 19 in. intake diameter, was designated the Model 19A, had a thrust of 1130 lb. and weighed 827 lb. It had a combustor section with 20 tubes (not interconnected at first), a single stage turbine and an adjustable jet exhaust nozzle. It was configured as a booster engine, with only the accessories needed to start and control the engine. The second engine built was flown in 1944 under a Chance Vought FG-1 fighter as a boost engine on the center-line. It delivered 1,365 lb of static thrust at sea level, standard day conditions. The booster engine could be started with impingement air on the turbine blades or by propeller slip stream on the ground. The engine was then modified into the Model 19B, which combined improved axial blade and stator design, a new annular combustion chamber and added a new accessories gearbox under the engine to drive airframe accessories such as hydraulics and a generator. The engine suffered from protracted problems with combustion hot spots and acceleration flat zones. Some Model 19B's were used to power the prototypes of the McDonnell XFD-1 and two powered the ill-fated Northrop XF-79B which crashed on its first flight due to no fault of the engines. Due to wartime secrecy, Westinghouse worked on its own, with no prior jet engine experience and without knowledge of German, British or other US jet engine developments. The basic principle of the engine was similar to the original Whittle engine developed in England, but Westinghouse‚Äôs use of an axial flow compressor, along with internal combustion chamber, were major advancements that led the way to a practical engine for aviation propulsion. (Earliest GE jet engines, based on the Whittle design and developed with Allison, featured a centrifugal compressor. GE and Allison had the Army contract to develop a ‚Äòland based‚Äô jet while the Westinghouse Navy contract was for carrier-based Navy jet fighters. ) One year later, an improved Model 19B, the 19XB-2B, changed to a 10 stage compressor. Under the new designation system, it was now called the J30. It was used to power the Navy‚Äôs first production jet fighter, the McDonnell Douglas FH-1 Phantom. Sixty one (61) Phantom planes were equipped with the J30 engine. (It is noteworthy that Pratt & Whitney Aircraft, then a major producer of piston aircraft engines for the military, entered the jet engine business in 1945 as a Westinghouse/US Navy licensee to build the J30 engine.) The J34, a 34-in. diameter engine that delivered 3000 lb. of thrust, turned out to be the last production engine built by Westinghouse at its Aviation Gas Turbine Division facility in Kansas City, KS. It was used extensively by the Navy in the McDonnell F2D Banshee, the Douglas F3D Skynight and Vought F7U-1 Cutlass, with the addition of an afterburner. Late in the 1940s, to meet the growing needs of the Navy for higher thrust and longer range (a jet bomber was planned as well as new Navy fighter jets), Westinghouse began development of the J40, with a target thrust of 7500 lb. (10,900 lb. with afterburner). The J40 program was plagued by delays and development problems. The most significant of these were the failure of the electronic control system and the need to replace it, development of the afterburner and the integration of the afterburner into the engine control system. The McDonnell F3H-1N Demon was the primary target for the engine and during development, its weight increased dramatically and the thrust of the original J40 was no longer adequate. an improved J40 with a 13 stage compressor and increased air flow failed in development and the Allison J71 with an afterburner was substituted. Due to delays in afterburner development on that engine, initial production of the long delayed F3H-2N was begun using the earlier J40 as a stop-gap. This soon proved to be a major mistake and both the J40 and Demon were grounded after a number of aircraft were lost. Ultimately, other aircraft planned for the J40 were either cancelled or outfitted with alternative engines, and the J40 was never qualified for full production. The program was terminated in 1955. Although production and support of the J34 continued, Westinghouse exited the jet engine business in 1960, closing the Kansas City operation, after having supplied engines for 1223 Navy jet planes. Ironically, the first Pan Am Boeing 707 had just flown its maiden commercial flight, powered by Pratt & Whitney jet engines, just a year earlier. A technical assistance agreement with Rolls-Royce appeared to influence many engines proposed after early 1952, but none of these designs found acceptance by US airframe manufacturers or the military. Following closure of AGT Division in 1960, many of its engineers joined the growing land-based gas turbine business of Westinghouse's Small Steam & Gas Turbine Division, located at its Steam Turbine manufacturing headquarters in Lester, PA, near to Philadelphia.

The mechanical resonator is located to the lower left of the coupling capacitor (small white square). The qubit is connected to upper right of the coupling capacitor. A quantum machine is a human-made device whose collective motion follows the laws of quantum mechanics. The idea that macroscopic objects may follow the laws of quantum mechanics dates back to the advent of quantum mechanics in the early 20th century.. However, as highlighted by the Schr√∂dinger's cat thought experiment, quantum effects are not readily observable in large-scale objects. Consequently, quantum states of motion have only been observed in special circumstances at extremely low temperatures. The fragility of quantum effects in macroscopic objects may arise from rapid quantum decoherence. Researchers created the first quantum machine in 2009, and the achievement was named the \\"Breakthrough of the Year\\" by Science in 2010. The first quantum machine Scanning electron micrograph of the film bulk acoustic resonator. The mechanically active part of the resonator is supported to the left by two metal leads which act as electrical connections. The first quantum machine was created on August 4, 2009 by Aaron D. O'Connell while pursuing his Ph.D. under the direction of Andrew N. Cleland and John M. Martinis at the University of California, Santa Barbara. O'Connell and his colleagues coupled together a mechanical resonator, similar to a tiny springboard, and a qubit, a device that can be in a superposition of two quantum states at the same time. They were able to make the resonator vibrate a small amount and a large amount simultaneously‚Äîan effect which would be impossible in classical physics. The mechanical resonator was just large enough to see with the naked eye‚Äîabout as long as the width of a human hair. The groundbreaking work was subsequently published in the journal Nature in March 2010. The journal Science declared the creation of the first quantum machine to be the \\"Breakthrough of the Year\\" of 2010. Cooling to the ground state In order to demonstrate the quantum mechanical behaviour, the team first needed to cool the mechanical resonator until it was in its quantum ground state (the state with the lowest possible energy). Specifically, a temperature was required, where h is the Planck Constant, f is the frequency of the resonator and k is the Boltzmann constant. Previous teams of researchers had struggled with this stage, as a 1 MHz resonator, for example, would need to be cooled to the extremely low temperature of 50 ŒºK.Steven Girvin, http://www.condmatjournalclub.org/wp- content/uploads/2010/04/jccm_april2010_013.pdf O'Connell's team constructed a different type of resonator, a film bulk acoustic resonator, with a much higher resonant frequency (6 GHz) which would hence reach its ground state at a (relatively) higher temperature (~0.1 K); this temperature could then be easily reached with a dilution refrigerator. In the experiment, the resonator was cooled to 25 mK. Controlling the quantum state The film bulk acoustic resonator was made of piezoelectric material, so that as it oscillated its changing shape created a changing electric signal, and conversely an electric signal could affect its oscillations. This property enabled the resonator to be coupled with a superconducting phase qubit, a device used in quantum computing whose quantum state can be accurately controlled. In quantum mechanics, vibrations are made up of elementary vibrations called phonons. Cooling the resonator to its ground state can be seen as equivalent to removing all of the phonons. The team was then able to transfer individual phonons from the qubit to the resonator. The team was also able to transfer a superposition state, where the qubit was in a superposition of two states at the same time, onto the mechanical resonator.Markus Aspelmeyer, \\"Quantum mechanics: the surf is up\\", Nature 464, 685‚Äì686 (1 April 2010) This means the resonator \\"literally vibrated a little and a lot at the same time\\", according to the American Association for the Advancement of Science.Brandon Bryn, \\"Science: The breakthroughs of 2010 and insights of the decade\\", American Association for the Advancement of Science, December 16, 2010 The vibrations lasted just a few nanoseconds before being broken down by disruptive outside influences.Richard Webb, \\"First quantum effects seen in visible object\\", New Scientist, March 17, 2010 In the Nature paper, the team concluded \\"This demonstration provides strong evidence that quantum mechanics applies to a mechanical object large enough to be seen with the naked eye.\\" Notes References External links Aaron D.

One form of it goes as follows. The boundary of a region in the plane acts as a mirror. A light source is put at any point inside the curve. Will every point be illuminated? In 1958 Roger Penrose solved the problem by inventing a region of which some part is left dark if the lamp is put in a certain other part. The reader should now look at his example, which can be seen free of charge, at the bottom of web page https://books.google.com/books?id=FTHZUDzW54cC&pg;=PA1597 We do not reproduce the figure here, to avoid copyright issues. However, since the presentation there is sketchy, we explain it in more detail. The upper part of the curve is an ellipse cut in half by its major axis. The lower part is a smooth curve under the axis except at the foci where it is tangent to the major axis. It is symmetric about the minor axis. A ray coming from one focus is reflected by an ellipse to the other focus. For later use, we call this the focal reflection property of the ellipse. Consider a ray of light coming out of the pocket. Let V be the point where it hits the ellipse. It is between the rays from V to the foci and hence its reflection will also be between those two rays and will go back into the middle pocket. Hence a light source in the middle pocket will leave the side pockets dark. Since light paths are reversible, a light source in the side pockets leaves the middle pocket dark. Penrose merely mentions that if one rotates the curve about its axis of symmetry, one gets a smooth 3-dimensional region which is not illuminable from points in the middle pocket or the side groove. The insight that enabled him to conclude this was that if we rotate an ellipse about its minor axis, the ellipsoid has the following focal reflection property: Let f be the circle described by the foci. The reflection of a ray coming from a point of f intersects f. To see this we use without proof the following fact from analytic geometry. An oblique circular cone is also a straight elliptical cone. The reflection property can be derived from this as follows. Let V be any point on the ellipsoid. We want to prove that every ray coming to V from a point of the circle of foci f is reflected to another point of f. The set of rays from V to f form an oblique circular cone C with vertex V. But C is also a straight elliptical cone. Its axis is the bisector of the angle of the two rays which lie in the plane we rotated to get the ellipsoid, so it is perpendicular to the ellipsoid. The cone is invariant under a 180-degree rotation around its axis. This rotation moves every ray into its reflection. Hence the reflection of every ray is on the cone and intersects the circle of foci f. Now we can derive that a ray r coming out of the central pocket is reflected back into the central pocket just as in the plane case. Let V be the point where r hits the dome. The plane formed by r and the normal to the dome at V will contain two generators of the cone. The ray r is between them and so will be its reflection, which will therefore go back into the pocket. Hence a source of light in the central pocket will leave the groove unlit, and vice versa. We can construct a plane region not illuminable from any of its points as follows. Take two disjoint Penrose curves. Cut open the cental pockets of both and connect the two boundary curves so that we get a single closed curve. We can think of the curve in two ways: the first half ellipse, with the rest of the curve constituting its central pocket, or the second half-ellipse, and the rest of the curve constituting its central pocket. A light source at any point will be in the central pocket of at least one of the elliptical parts and will not illuminate the side pockets of that part. 3-dimensional regions not illuminable from any of their points can be constructed in the same way. Polygonal rooms have been constructed which are not quite illuminable (one point not illuminated).

Between Livet-et-Gavet and Le Bourg-d'Oisans, the Romanche forms a deep gorge. Its geographical definition coincides almost exactly with the former cantons of Le Bourg-d'Oisans (Is√®re) and La Grave (Hautes Alpes). The Oisans covers parts of the massifs of Belledonne, Taillefer, Grandes Rousses, Arves and √âcrins. The highest point in the region is the mountain of Pic Lory, a subpeak of the Barre des √âcrins which reaches a height of 4,088 metres, but the most symbolic peak is la Meije which is nicknamed the \\"Queen of the Oisans\\". The Oisans is a remarkable territory, thanks to its numerous mountain chains, valleys, rivers, streams and plains. The Oisans is a very touristic region, both for winter and summer sports. Oisans regularly hosts the Tour de France as well as many major sporting events on a European scale (Super-Biker, World of Snowboarding, Skiing World, the Bike Festival, Andros Trophy or the Criterium Cyclist of Dauphin√© Lib√©r√©). The provincial road 1091 (formerly RN 91) is the main access road into this area, beginning in the town of Livet-et- Gavet. In recent years, the RD1091 has been significantly upgraded, with various ring roads that provide faster access and more enjoyable access to the Oisans. The town of Bourg d'Oisans is the equivalent of the capital of this territory because this town is at the centre of six valleys.

Like the two other members of its genus, it lives on the decomposing remains of other fleshy mushrooms. The fungus produces small whitish fruit bodies with caps up to wide held by thin stems up to long. On the underside of the cap are closely spaced white gills that are broadly attached to the stem. At the base of the stem, embedded in the substrate is a small reddish-brown sclerotium that somewhat resembles an apple seed. The appearance of the sclerotium distinguishes it from the other two species of Collybia, which are otherwise very similar in overall appearance. C. tuberosa is found in Europe, North America, and Japan, growing in dense clusters on species of Lactarius and Russula, boletes, hydnums, and polypores. Taxonomy, phylogeny, and naming The species was first described under the name Agaricus tuberosus by the French naturalist Jean Bulliard in the 6th volume of his Herbier de la France (1786). Christian Hendrik Persoon called it Agaricus amanitae subsp. tuberosus in his 1799 publication Observationes Mycologicae, while Samuel Frederick Gray referred it to Gymnopus in 1821. It was transferred to Collybia by Paul Kummer in 1886. The species has also been called Microcollybia tuberata in a 1979 publication by Joanne Lennox, but the genus Microcollybia has since been folded into Collybia. Additional taxonomic synonyms include Marasmius sclerotipes Bres. 1881, Chamaeceras sclerotipes (Bres.) Kuntze 1898, and Collybia sclerotipes (Bres.) S.Ito 1950. Molecular phylogenetic analysis reported in 2001 used RNA sequences to establish that C. tuberosa forms a monophyletic group with C. cookei and C. cirrhata; this finding was later corroborated in a 2006 publication. The specific epithet tuberosa is derived from the Latin word for \\"tuberous\\". The mushroom is commonly known as the \\"lentil shanklet\\", or the \\"appleseed coincap\\". Samuel Gray called it the \\"tuberous naked-foot\\" in his 1821 Natural Arrangement of British plants. Description Bulliard's original drawing of C. tuberosa The cap of C. tuberosa ranges in shape from obtusely convex to cushion-shaped with a margin curved inward when young, to flattened in age, with margin curved downward to straight. The cap sometimes has a shallow depression in the center, or a shallow umbo. Its diameter is small, reaching a maximum of . The cap surface is dry to moist, smooth to covered with fine soft hairs, and somewhat hygrophanous‚Äîchanging color depending on the level of hydration. Sometimes the cap margin is pleated or grooved. The center of the cap is pinkish-buff but whitish around the margin, and it becomes whitish overall as it matures. The flesh is thin, and colored whitish to light buff. The mushroom has no distinctive taste or odor, and is considered inedible. The white to buff-colored gills are bluntly attached to the stem and closely spaced. The gills are adnate (bluntly fused to the stem), becoming subdecurrent with age (running slightly down the length of the stem). The gill spacing is close to subdistant, and the individual gills are whitish to pinkish-buff, thin, narrow to moderately broad, and have straight edges. The stem is long by , and roughly equal in width throughout its length. It is slender and thread-like, flexible and pliant, with a dry surface. The top of the stem is covered with scales or a fine whitish powder, while the lower portion has hairs ranging from delicate to coarse. The color of the stem is generally whitish to pinkish-buff, but it darkens after it has been handled. The stem interior is pithy, and becomes hollow with age. The stems originate from a dark reddish-brown sclerotium of variable shape, typically measuring by . The surface of the sclerotium is initially smooth, but later becomes wrinkled or furrowed; its interior is solid and white. It is often compared to an apple seed in appearance. Typically, several sclerotia are connected by thin strands of mycelia. The sclerotium is a resting structure that allows to fungus to overwinter in its host. In 1915, William Murrill reported the sclerotia of C. tuberosa to be bioluminescent. The spore print is white. Individual spores are smooth, ellipsoid to tear-shaped in profile, obovoid to ellipsoid or cylindric in face or back view, with dimensions of 4.2‚Äì6.2 by 2.8‚Äì3.5Œºm. They are inamyloid and acyanophilous (non-reactive to staining with Melzer's reagent and Methyl blue, respectively). The basidia (spore-bearing cells in the hymenium) are club-shaped to cylindric and 15.4‚Äì21 by 3.5‚Äì5 Œºm. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) are scattered to infrequent, inconspicuous, and 17.5‚Äì31.5 Œºm long. Their shape ranges from a contorted cylinder to roughly club-shaped to irregularly diverticulate (with short offshoots approximately at right angles to the main stem). There are no pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face). The gill tissue is made of interwoven hyphae that are non-reactive to Melzer's reagent. These hyphae are smooth and thin-walled, measuring 2.8‚Äì6.4 Œºm in diameter. The cap tissue is made of hyphae that is interwoven below the center of the cap, radially oriented over the gills, and inamyloid. These hyphae are smooth, thin-walled, and 2.8‚Äì7 Œºm in diameter. The cap cuticle is a thin layer of smooth thin- walled hyphae that are more or less radially oriented, bent-over, cylindric and somewhat gelatinous, measuring 2‚Äì5 Œºm in diameter; they are occasionally diverticulate. The cuticle of the stem is made of a layer of parallel, vertically oriented smooth, thin-walled hyphae that are 2‚Äì4.2 Œºm in diameter, pale yellowish brown in alkali mounting solution. The stem has moderately thin-walled and smooth cystidia that are resemble flexuous or contorted cylinders. They are hyaline in alkali, and 3.5‚Äì7 Œºm in diameter. Clamp connections are present in the hyphae of all tissues. Similar species Baeospora myosura is similar in size and appearance to C. tuberosa, but grows on spruce and Douglas-fir cones. The \\"Magnolia coincap\\" (Strobilurus conigenoides) is smaller and grows on the cones of Magnolias. The two remaining Collybia species closely resemble C. tuberosa, but can be distinguished by examining the stem bases at the point of attachment into the substrate. C. cookei has roughly spherical, light brown to yellowish sclerotia, while C. cirrhata does not produce sclerotia. In the field, C. tuberosa may be distinguished from C. cookei by its dark reddish-brown sclerotia that somewhat resembles an appleseed. A microscope provides a more definitive way of distinguishing the two: the hyphae in the sclerotia of C. cookei are rounded, while those of C. tuberosa are elongated; this diagnostic character is apparent with both fresh and dried material of the two species. In contrast, C. cirrhata does not produce sclerotia. Habitat and distribution It is not known if C. tuberosa is strictly parasitic, and needs the host to be living, or whether it is saprobic. Either way, the fruit bodies of the fungus are found growing solitarily or in dense clusters on the decomposing, often blackened remains of other mushrooms. Hosts include agarics (particularly Lactarius and Russula), boletes, hydnums, and polypores. In the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, Russula crassotunicata is a common and abundant species that has been definitively identified as a host of both C. tuberosa and Dendrocollybia racemosa. The Russula fruit bodies are slow to decay, and are available nearly year-round as a substrate for the saprobes. Based on field observations, the authors suggest that C. tuberosa may produce fruit bodies on less decayed mushrooms, while D. racemosa produces them on much more heavily decayed mushrooms. Collybia tuberosa is found in Europe and North America, and in most common in the summer and autumn, coinciding with the fruiting periods of other mushrooms. It has also been reported from Japan.

It is known from Europe, Asia, and North America. The fungus produces fruit bodies that usually grow on the decomposing remains of other mushrooms, like Meripilus giganteus, Inonotus hispidus, or species of Russula; occasionally fruit bodies are found on rich humus or well-decayed wood. The fungus produces small white mushrooms with caps up to in diameter, supported by thin stems that originate from a yellowish-brown sclerotium. The mushroom is difficult to distinguish from the other two species of Collybia unless an effort is made to examine the sclerotia, which is usually buried in the substrate. The edibility of the mushroom has not been determined. Taxonomy and phylogeny The species was first described in the scientific literature in 1928 as Collybia cirrhata var. cookei by the Italian mycologist Giacomo Bresadola. In a 1935 publication, Jean D. Arnold reported a series of cultural studies with monokaryon isolates (hypha having only a single haploid nucleus) of several Collybia species to determine their mating type. All attempts to produce hybrids between C. cirrhata var. cookei and C. cirrata or mycelial fusions between the two species failed. This sexual incompatibility indicated that the two taxa were separate species, and she raised the taxon from varietal to specific status, calling it Collybia cookei. The species has also been called Microcollybia cookei in a 1979 publication by Joanne Lennox, but the genus Microcollybia has since been folded into Collybia. Marcel Bon and R√©gis Courtecuisse considered the species a variety of Collybia tuberosa in a 1988 publication. A 2001 molecular analysis based on the ribosomal DNA sequences confirmed that C. cookei is phylogenetically related to C. tuberosa and C. cirrhata, and that the three species form a monophyletic group that comprise the genus Collybia. The specific epithet cookei honors the British mycologist Mordecai Cubitt Cooke. Description adnate, and their spacing is close to subdistant. The caps of young mushrooms are roughly spherical, but soon become convex to flattened in maturity, and reach diameters of . The cap margin is rolled or curled inward when young, but straightens out as it matures. The cap color is white to cream. The gills are broadly adnate to slightly decurrent, with a color similar to the cap; their spacing is close to subdistant. The whitish stem is equal in width throughout, usually not straight but with curves, and long by thick. The upper region of the stem surface can be covered with what appears to be a white powder, and there are thin hairs near the base. The stems originate from a yellowish-brown sclerotium that is up to long. The sclerotium ranges in shape from roughly spherical to almond-shaped to irregular, and its surface is often wrinkled and pitted. The mushroom has no distinctive odor or taste, and its edibility is unknown. In deposit, the spore color is white. The spores are smooth, ellipsoidal to tear-shaped, hyaline (translucent), not amyloid, and measure 3.9‚Äì5.2 by 2.6‚Äì3.3 Œºm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells in the hymenium) are four-spored and hyaline, with dimensions of 16‚Äì20 by 4‚Äì5 Œºm. They have clamps at their bases. There are no cystidia on either the edges (cheilocystidia) or faces (pleurocystidia) of the gills. The arrangement of the hyphae in the hymenophoral tissue varies from regular to interwoven. The cap cuticle is a cutis (a type of tissue where the hyphae are arranged more or less parallel to the surface), formed by hyphae with septa, roughly 4‚Äì9 Œºm in diameter. Clamp connections are present in the hyphae. The sclerotium is made of hyphae that have yellow pigment in their walls that appear in cross-section to be pseudoparenchymatous (compactly interwoven short-celled hyphae that resemble parenchyma of higher plants), and measure 5‚Äì10 Œºm in diameter. Similar species Asterophora lycoperdoides has thicker stems and brown powder on the cap surface. Collybia cookei is most likely to be confused with the two other members of Collybia, both of which are outwardly similar in appearance; distinguishing between the three typically requires excavating the stem base away from the moss or debris in which the stem is embedded. In the field, C. tuberosa may be distinguished from C. cookei by its dark brown sclerotia that somewhat resembles an appleseed. Using a microscope provides a more definitive way of distinguishing the two: the hyphae in the sclerotia of C. cookei are rounded, while those of C. tuberosa are elongated; this diagnostic character is apparent with both fresh and dried material of the two species. C. cirrhata does not produce sclerotia. Another mushroom that grows on decomposing fruit bodies is Asterophora lycoperdoides, which is distinct from C. cookei because of the powdery brown asexual spores (chlamydospores) produced on the cap surface. Alexander H. Smith has noted a general similarity in appearance between C. cookei and the North American species Clitocybe sclerotoidea (then known as Tricholoma sclerotoideum), which is parasitic to Helvella lacunosa. However, C. sclerotoidea is larger than C. cookei, with cap diameters up to , and has more distantly spaced gills. Habitat and distribution Like all members of the genus Collybia, C. cookei grows on the well-rotted, blackened remains of mushrooms, such as species of Russula, Meripilus giganteus, and Inonotus hispidus. Fruit bodies occasionally grow on well-decayed wood or rich humus. The fruit bodies grow scattered, clustered, or in groups. A field study conducted near a Brass mill in Sweden revealed that heavy metal contamination had little effect on the appearance of the mushroom, possibly because its substrate of partially decomposed fruit bodies has a lower metal concentration that the underlying topsoil. Collybia cookei is found in Europe, Asia (Japan), and North America. The European distribution extends north to the Arctic Circle and the Lofoten Islands. The species is widely distributed in North America; it was reported from Mexico for the first time in 1998. The fungus is partial to mixed forest dominated by aspen and conifers in montane and subalpine environments. In The Netherlands, it was a component of one of three communities of saprobic fungi associated with roadside verges (the land between the road edge and the adjacent wall, fence or hedge) planted with common oak (Quercus robur); the verges also supported the growth of the mushroom Russula ochroleuca, a host of C. cookei.

The species was first described in the scientific literature in 1786, but not validly named until 1803. Found in Europe, Northern Eurasia, and North America, it is known from temperate, boreal, and alpine or arctic habitats. It is a saprobic species that grows in clusters on the decaying or blackened remains of other mushrooms. The fruit bodies are small, with whitish convex to flattened caps up to in diameter, narrow white gills, and slender whitish stems long and up to thick. C. cirrhata can be distinguished from the other two members of Collybia by the absence of a sclerotium at the base of the stem. The mushroom, although not poisonous, is considered inedible because of its insubstantial size. Taxonomy and phylogeny The species first appeared in the scientific literature in 1786 as Agaricus amanitae by August Johann Georg Karl Batsch; Agaricus amanitae subsp. cirrhatus, proposed by Christian Hendrik Persoon in 1800, is considered synonymous. A later combination based on this name, Collybia amanitae, was published by Hanns Kreisel in 1987. However, Kreisel noted the combination to be \\"ined.\\", indicating that he did not believe the name to be validly published, according to article 34.1 of the rules for botanical nomenclature, which states: \\"A name is not validly published ... when it is not accepted by the author in the original publication.\\" The first correct name was published in 1803 by Heinrich Christian Friedrich Schumacher, who called the species Agaricus cirrhatus. French mycologist Lucien Qu√©let transferred it to Collybia in 1879, resulting in the binomial by which it is currently known. The species had also been transferred to Microcollybia by Georges M√©trod in 1952 and again by Lennox in 1979 (because M√©trod's transfer was considered a nomen nudum, and thus invalid according to nomenclatural rules); the genus Microcollybia has since been wrapped into Collybia. Molecular phylogenetics have shown that C. cirrhata forms a monophyletic clade with the remaining two species of Collybia. Because C. cirrhata is the only one of the three Collybia species lacking sclerotia, it has been suggested that this character trait is an anapomorphy‚Äîthat is, unique to a single, terminal species within a clade. The specific epithet is derived from the Latin cirrata, meaning \\"curled\\". Charles Horton Peck called it the \\"fringed- rooted Collybia\\". In the United Kingdom, it is commonly known as the \\"piggyback shanklet\\". Description The small fruit bodies typically grow in dense clusters. The cap is initially convex when young, later becoming convex to flattened or slightly depressed in the center, reaching a diameter of . The cap margin starts out rolled or curved inward, but straightens out as it matures. The cap surface ranges from dry to moist, smooth to covered with fine whitish hairs, and is mostly even with translucent radial grooves at the margin. It is subhygrophanous (changing color somewhat depending on hydration), becoming a grayish-orange when watery or old, and usually is white with a very faint pinkish flush when fresh. The flesh is whitish, quite thin, and has no distinctive taste or odor. The gills are adnate to slightly arcuate (curved into the shape of a bow) with a tooth (meaning that the gills curve up to join the stem but then, very close to the stem, the gill edge curves down again). There are between 12 and 20 gills that extend completely from the cap edge to the stem, and three to five tiers of lamellulae (shorter gills that do not extend completely from the cap edge to the stem). The gills are thin, narrow to moderately broad, and white to pinkish-buff. The gill edges are even, and the same color as the gill faces. The stem is long and up to thick, equal in width throughout to slightly enlarged downward, flexible and filamentous but not fragile. The stem surface is dry, whitish to grayish- orange, sometimes with tiny hairs on the upper portion that become coarser near the base. The stem base often has rhizomorph-like strands or copious whitish mycelia. The stem, unlike the other two species of Collybia, do not originate from a sclerotium. The stem becomes hollow as it matures. Although it is not considered poisonous, C. cirrhata is too small and insubstantial to be considered edible. Microscopic characteristics In deposit, the spores appear white. Individual spores are ellipsoid to tear-shaped in profile, obovoid to ellipsoid or roughly cylindric in face or back view, with dimensions of 4.8‚Äì6.4 by 2‚Äì2.8 (sometimes up to 3.5) ¬µm. They are smooth, inamyloid, and acyanophilous (unreactive to staining with Melzer's reagent and methyl blue, respectively). The basidia (spore-bearing cells of the hymenium) are roughly club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 17.5‚Äì21 by 4.8‚Äì5.6 ¬µm. The gills do not have cystidia. The gill tissue is made of hyphae that are interwoven to roughly parallel, and inamyloid. The hyphae are 2.8‚Äì8.4 ¬µm in diameter and smooth. The cap tissue is made of interwoven hyphae beneath the center of the cap, but radially oriented over the gills; it too is inamyloid. These hyphae are 3.5‚Äì8.4 ¬µm in diameter, smooth, but have irregularly thickened walls. The cap cuticle is an ixocutis‚Äîa gelatinized layer of hyphae lying parallel to the cap surface. The hyphae comprising this layer are 2.8‚Äì6.4 ¬µm in diameter, smooth, and thin-walled. They are covered with scattered, short pouch-like outgrowths. The cuticle of the stem is a layer of parallel, vertically oriented hyphae; the hyphae measure 3.5‚Äì4.2 ¬µm, and are smooth, slightly thick-walled, and pale yellowish-brown in alkaline solution. They give rise to a covering of tangled and branched caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem) that have multiple septa. The caulocystidia are 2.8‚Äì4.8 ¬µm in diameter, smooth, thin walled, and shaped like contorted cylinders. Clamp connections are present in the hyphae of all tissues. Similar species Collybia cirrhata is most likely to be confused with the remaining members of Collybia, which have a similar external appearance. C. tuberosa is distinguished by its dark reddish-brown sclerotia that resemble apple seeds, while C. cookei has wrinkled, often irregularly shaped sclerotia that are pale yellow to orange. Other similar mushrooms include Baeospora myosura and species of Strobilurus, but these species only grow on pine cones. Habitat and distribution Like all species remaining in the genus Collybia, C. cirrhata is saprobic, and is typically found growing on the decaying or blackened remains of other mushrooms; occasionally the fruit bodies may be found growing on moss or soil without any apparent connection to decaying mushrooms, although these observations may represent instances where the remnant host tissue‚Äîpossibly from a previous season‚Äîhas decayed to such an extent that it remains as buried fragments in the substrate. Known hosts include Lactarius, Russula, Meripilus giganteus, and Bovista dermoxantha. Collybia cirrhata is known from temperate, boreal, and alpine or arctic habitats. The fungus is widespread in Europe, including Bulgaria, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Latvia, Scandinavia, Slovakia, Switzerland, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. The mushroom is also common in northern montane regions of North America. In Asia, the fungus has been reported in Korea, and in Hokkaido, northern Japan. It is also known from Greenland. A 2009 publication suggested that based on the known evidence, the species' distribution may be circumboreal.

Sawyer, located on the Milwaukee Riverwalk in downtown Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The Bronze Fonz depicts Henry Winkler as \\"The Fonz,\\" a character in the 1970s television series Happy Days, which was set in Milwaukee. Description The sculpture, made of bronze, depicts actor Henry Winkler as he appeared in his role as Arthur Fonzarelli (also known as \\"Fonzie\\" or \\"The Fonz\\"). Fonzarelli was an iconic character in the 1970s television show Happy Days, a sitcom about a family in 1950s‚Äì1960s Milwaukee. He stands in his usual attire, a leather jacket and jeans, and gives a two-handed thumbs up gesture, as he often did in Happy Days. The statue is located on the Milwaukee Riverwalk, just south of Wells Street. It is accompanied by an inscription that lists donors who contributed to the Bronze Fonz project. History Acquisition The Bronze Fonz was commissioned by Visit Milwaukee, a non- profit group with the purpose of promoting tourism and bringing new businesses to Milwaukee. Visit Milwaukee raised $85,000 to commission the statue. Over the decade prior to the statue's creation, other similar television character based bronze statues, commissioned by the cable television channel, TV Land, had been built in other cities and towns to portray such figures as Mary Tyler Moore (as Mary Richards from The Mary Tyler Moore Show) in Minneapolis and Jackie Gleason (as Ralph Kramden from The Honeymooners) outside the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Manhattan. However, TV Land scrapped its plans to build a Fonz statue after a change in their marketing strategy in 2007. The sculpture was unveiled on August 18, 2008. Most of the Happy Days cast, including Winkler, Marion Ross, Tom Bosley, Erin Moran, Don Most, and Anson Williams, attended the dedication ceremony. Winkler referred to the statue as \\"unbelievable.\\" Opposition Mike Brenner, then a local gallery owner and executive director of Milwaukee Artist Resource Network (MARN), objected to the statue, which was originally planned to be located at the intersection of Wisconsin and Water Streets, a prominent downtown site. He threatened to close his gallery and resign his position in MARN if \\"that stupid Fonzie sculpture\\" was erected there. Brenner received death threats for speaking out against the Bronze Fonz, and reposted several on his web site. The CEO of the Milwaukee Art Museum, David Gordon, along with Milwaukee Journal Sentinel arts critic Mary-Louise Schumacher and other Milwaukee arts dignitaries, also opposed the statue, which ultimately was erected instead at the Riverwalk site. Brenner nevertheless closed his gallery in May 2008, and opened a Milwaukee microbrewery. In popular culture  * The statue is referenced in the lyrics of the 2014 song \\"Milwaukee\\" by The Both. The song, which recounted the local origin of the collaboration between the duo of Aimee Mann and Ted Leo, was the first single from their self-titled debut album. * In the 2015 novel In the Drink by Allyson K. Abbott, part of a cozy mystery series set in Milwaukee, the body of a murder victim is found underneath the Bronze Fonz statue.

The group formed in 2003 and released two EPs, one compilation album, and one studio album, 2006's Nightmerica. They toured the United States several times, but encountered problems when founding bassist Dominic Davi was arrested in March 2007 on allegations of rape and subsequently dismissed from the band. He was replaced by former Distillers and Angels & Airwaves bassist Ryan Sinn, and the band toured Europe and the United Kingdom. After Sinn left, a retooled Love Equals Death lineup performed on the 2008 Warped Tour and planned to record a second album, but disbanded after singer and founding member Chon Travis quit in January 2009. History 2003‚Äì05: Formation and EPs Love Equals Death formed in Petaluma, California in 2003, and generally celebrated Halloween as the anniversary of their formation. The band's initial lineup consisted of vocalist Chon Travis (formerly of Loose Change and Envain), guitarist John Rosser, bassist Dominic Davi (formerly of Tsunami Bomb), and drummer Tonio Garcia-Romero. Their first release of recorded material was a cover version of \\"Dammit Janet\\" on the compilation album The Rocky Horror Punk Rock Show, released that December. Their debut EP, 4 Notes on a Dying Scale, was released through Popsmear Records, and the band supported it with shows in the San Francisco Bay Area and their first United States tour in September 2004. A second tour followed from February to April 2005. Rosser was replaced by Duffs, and the group continued to tour. A compilation album titled The Prelude was released in Japan in July 2005 through the Treasure Trunk label, consisting of 4 Notes on a Dying Scale along with demo tracks. The Hucklebuck EP was released the following month through Popsmear. Love Equals Death signed to Fat Wreck Chords in August 2005 after label head Fat Mike was impressed by their live performance. A United States tour followed from October to December 2005, supporting The God Awfuls and The Eyeliners. 2006: Nightmerica Love Equals Death recorded their full-length album Nightmerica in November 2005 at The Blasting Room in Fort Collins, Colorado, with producers Bill Stevenson and Jason Livermore. Leading up to the album's release, they toured the United States as an opening act for Pennywise, No Use for a Name, and The Suicide Machines in January 2006, and for Tiger Army that March. Nightmerica was released March 21, 2006. Corey Apar of Allmusic called it \\"way more interesting than their fake horror film fa√ßade would suggest ... Love Equals Death is really more like a multifaceted version of a late-'90s skate punk band ... promising and refreshing in its mix of old and new sounds, Nightmerica is a breath of fresh air among the ironic screamo bands of the world.\\" Chris Moran of Punknews.org complemented the range of Travis' vocals and the musicianship as \\"extremely tight\\", but felt that the songs went in too many musical directions to give the band a firm identity: \\"This record is just all over the map. One minute we've got some Goth Bay hardcore, the next we've got Morrissey ... Nightmerica has some really good songs. But the album itself lacks direction and seems almost rushed ... there's just too much going on for one album. Especially from a band that many are not too familiar with.\\" Both reviewers likened Nightmerica to the first four albums by AFI. Love Equals Death supported the album with a music video for the song \\"Pray for Me\\" and by playing shows with the Mad Caddies, Mercy Killers, Verse, Rise Against, Strike Anywhere, Sick of It All, Stretch Arm Strong, and First Blood before touring with Time Again from May through June 2006. They also opened for Death by Stereo that August and released a second music video in October, for the song \\"Bombs Over Brooklyn\\". A tour across the United States with labelmates the Mad Caddies followed through November. 2007: Davi's arrest and departure In January 2007 Love Equals Death toured California and the southwestern United States with fellow Fat Wreck Chords acts NOFX, Strike Anywhere, and Dead to Me. Towards the end of the tour, the band was robbed in Sacramento, California, when their tour van was broken into and personal belongings were stolen. A music video was released for the song \\"Truth Has Failed\\", featuring cameos by members of Pennywise, AFI, The Suicide Machines, and No Use for a Name. A split album with Death by Stereo was planned. That March they toured the west coast with AFI, Smoke or Fire, Viva Hate, The Shook Ones, and Love Me Destroyer. On Love Equals Death's penultimate night of the tour, bassist Dominic Davi was arrested in Fullerton, California, on charges stemming from an alleged rape of a Virginia woman in June 2006. Singer Chon Travis issued a statement saying \\"We at camp LED stand by [Davi] and hope that this will all clear up soon. We will not pass any judgement on anyone until this is settled\\". However, less than two weeks later he announced Davi's separation from the band: > We would like to make it perfectly clear here at camp LED that we do not in > any way condone any such behavior related to these charges. We, however, are > not a judge or a jury and don't want to be one any time soon. We are however > a band that really just wants to continue playing music. We know that these > times have been severely trying for Dominic and the accuser. We hope for the > best outcome for all parties. However, Dominic will no longer be playing > music or working on behalf of Love Equals Death. This matter that he faces > requires all of his attention right now and we wish him well as I know all > of you do. In a July 2008 statement, Davi maintained his innocence and said that the charge of rape had been dropped, though he had pleaded guilty to misdemeanor indecent assault, and gave his thoughts on his departure from the band: > I want to make this absolutely clear, I never raped anyone. Ever. And the > charges of rape were dropped against me back in December [2007]. Even the > state prosecutor involved in this case admitted that he didn't believe I > ever raped anyone. The person that made these accusations against me changed > her story about what happened that night every single time she told it. So, > despite the fact that I never, ever, forced this girl to make out with me, > touch me, or anything, and despite the fact that it was extremely difficult > for me to plead guilty to something I absolutely did not do, I chose to take > the charge of misdemeanor indecent assault for the sake of avoiding yet more > emotional and financial strains on my family, my loved ones, and myself. > It's fair to say that the guys in Love Equals Death freaked out when all of > this happened. I don't blame them for that ‚Äì there isn't a guide book to > follow in a situation like this. They made it clear to me that they needed > to focus on the band and their career as best as they could, and that it > would be best for me to focus on my defense. It hurt at the time, but I knew > I did have to focus on defending myself. 2008‚Äì09: Lineup changes and disbanding Love Equals death remained active, scheduling a May 2007 performance with the Germs and stating they had written new songs and would still be releasing a split album with Death by Stereo. In June 2007 Ryan Sinn, formerly of The Distillers and Angels & Airwaves, joined the band as Davi's replacement. The group premiered a new song, \\"Last Dance\\", that October through their Myspace profile, while Sinn also formed a supergroup called The Innocent with Brooks Wackerman of Bad Religion, Brandan Schieppati of Bleeding Through, and Dave Nassie of No Use for a Name. Love Equals Death toured with Tiger Army in November, then travelled to Europe and the United Kingdom for a headlining tour through December. By March 2008 Sinn had been replaced by Sean Jordon, and Bryan Kelly-Holden had joined the band as rhythm guitarist. This lineup played seven dates of the 2008 Warped Tour and planned to record their follow-up to Nightmerica that August with producers Travis Richter and Lee Dyness. However, Chon Travis left Love Equals Death in January 2009, citing a desire to pursue a solo project: > Love Equals Death proved to be a strong band and a fun band to be in, but I > never felt comfortable in the band. I never felt like it was my band or that > I was really a part of everyone else here ... Right before I joined LED, I > started a solo project that I put on the back burner, because things were > going well with LED and I ended up getting too busy to focus on it. I kept > writing songs for both LED and the solo shit, knowing one day I would have > to part ways with LED to fulfill my desire to express myself the way I had > always dreamed. I was going to do this sooner and then [Davi was arrested]. > So I stayed to help get the band back on track and I never leave anything on > a negative note. That April Love Equals Death announced their breakup, saying \\"It's been a back and forth battle with everyone here to move on or to let go of this thing we love so much. We have decided to let go of Love Equals Death and preserve the good times we had and the hurdles we had to overcome. We will no longer be functioning as a band and will be calling it quits.\\" Post-breakup activity Following Love Equals Death's disbanding, Duffs, Jordon, and Kelly-Holden formed a new band, Good Knives, with singer Shaun Phillips of British punk rock band The Ruined. Using songs they had written for Love Equals Death's proposed second album and working with producer Lee Dyness, the group released an eponymously titled album in March 2010 and toured Europe. In November 2011 Chon Travis was arrested in Ukiah, California, and jailed on charges of methamphetamine and ecstasy use, possession and transport of methamphetamine for sale, and driving with a suspended license, after police reportedly found more than 11 grams of methamphetamine in his car. Travis denied the accusations, claiming the evidence had been planted and that he had tried to cooperate with the police.

She was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President George W. Bush in December 2006. She turned 100 in December 2016. Biography Colvin was born Ruth Johnson in Chicago, Illinois, on December 16, 1916. She was the daughter of Lillian Johnson and Harry Johnson (1891‚Äì1929), a Swedish-American, and owner of a construction conglomerate in Chicago. She was eldest of five children. Early years She attended Thornton Junior College in Harvey, Illinois, where she received a two-year degree. She also attended Moser Business College in Chicago and Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, where she met her future husband, Robert Colvin, who was majoring in business administration at Northwestern. She also became a member of the Kappa Delta chapter. They married in 1940, moved to Seattle, Washington, then Syracuse, New York, where he built a \\"lucrative sales and consulting career\\" around industrial chemicals. Together, the couple had two children. She earned a Bachelor of Science degree from Syracuse University in 1959. Early career Colvin became aware of the problem of illiteracy in her hometown of Syracuse when the 1960 census reports were released and in 1962 she learned that the city had over 11,000 people functioning at the lowest level of literacy. Always an avid reader herself, she worked with reading specialists at Syracuse University and developed materials to train volunteer tutors various motivation and instruction techniques. She developed two tutor training manuals; Tutor and I Speak English which are considered to be authoritative sources for training volunteer tutors to teach adults basic literacy or English as a second language. The first tutors who completed the program were from Colvin's church women's group. Literacy volunteers In 1962, Literacy Volunteers, Inc. was founded in Syracuse. The organization was chartered in New York State in 1967 as a tax-exempt, non-profit and the name was changed to Literacy Volunteers of America, Inc. (LVA). It is a national, educational, non-profit organization with staff at the local, state and national levels and a volunteer board of directors. Colvin was the first president of the organization and a lifetime member of the board of directors. In 1974, she created the English as a Second Language training program as well as a new reading series for learners. During the next few years she helped found The National Coalition for Literacy to increase public awareness of illiteracy. Colvin also published Student Involvement Guidelines to encourage student involvement in all aspects of literacy programs. The organization currently has 330 programs in 42 states with over 100,000 volunteers and students. The non-profit works in conjunction with correctional facilities, adult educational programs, libraries, universities, community service programs and industry. The non-profit looks for effective ways to teach basic literacy and English as a second language which stresses the importance of educationally sound \\"learner-centered\\" training of tutors and \\"ongoing support system.\\" From 1991 to 2001, Colvin helped with administration, training and fund development in Swaziland, in the development of the country's only literacy program. She also assessed the needs and gave initial training for the Rotary Clubs of Zambia, to set up Readers are Leaders in Zambia fund. ProLiteracy worldwide ProLiteracy Worldwide was formed when Laubach Literacy International and Literacy Volunteers of America, Inc. merged in 2002. Laubach Literacy International's history begins in 1930, when Dr. Frank C. Laubach was a missionary among the Maranao people of the Philippines. His concern about their poor living conditions led him to conclude that the ability to read and write was essential for them to begin to solve their problems. As the Maranaos learned to read, they would, in turn, teach other adults on a one-to-one basis that became known as \\"Each One Teach One.\\" From 1935 to 1967, Dr. Laubach visited 105 countries answering calls for literacy help and created reading lessons in 315 languages. He founded Laubach Literacy International in Syracuse in 1955. Civic contributions By 1977, Colvin was on the board of directors of the Syracuse Boy's Club and Consolidated Industries. She was also active in Volunteers of Greater Syracuse. Presidential medal of freedom Colvin with Norman C. Francis (center) and Paul Johnson (right) at the White House in December 2006.

He is best known as the chemist who discovered the iridium anomaly in the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene boundary layer that led the team of Luis Alvarez, Walter Alvarez, Frank Asaro, and Helen Michel to propose the Asteroid-Impact Theory, which postulates that an asteroid hit the Earth sixty-five million years ago and caused mass extinction during the age of the dinosaurs.Frank Asaro, Nuclear Chemist Who Contributed to Dinosaur Extinction Theory and Archaeological Studies, Passes Away The Berkeley Years Asaro went to college at age sixteen during World War II and earned both his undergraduate and Ph.D. degrees in chemistry from the University of California, Berkeley. For his doctorate, he worked with Professor Isadore Perlman on alpha decay processes in nuclear chemistry.Memoire of Isadore Perlman Asaro and Perlman collaborated over the next fourteen years on studies of nuclear structure. It was during this time that they developed a high-precision technique of neutron activation analysis that has become a standard for determining the origin of ancient artifacts, in particular pottery.http://archaeometry.missouri.edu/datasets/lbnl/index.html Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Nuclear Archaeology Database Asaro initially agreed to work on the project for a few months. He writes, \\"How good was Perlman at choosing new fields? I thought I would take three months off to do this. I made that decision in 1967, and I'm still doing this work 32 years later.\\"\\"Nuclear Physics Sheds Light on Ancient Archeological Mysteries One of the first projects Asaro tackled with Perlman was a study of ancient pottery from Cyprus, known as Cypriot Bichrome ware. Aided by the Swedish archaeologist Einar Gjerstad, they obtained 1,200 pottery sherds from the second millennium B.C. excavated by the Swedish Cyprus Expedition in 1927-31. Among the many results of those studies was the work done with Michal Artzy, a then graduate student at Brandeis. Up until that time, a distinctive type pottery called \\"Bichrome Ware,\\" first found in Tel Ajjul in Palestine by the archaeologist Sir Flinders Petrie, was believed to originate in Palestine after which it was exported to sites in the eastern Mediterranean. Thrown on a fast wheel and painted with animals and birds, the unusual pottery appeared to be the work of a new painter or school of painting. The Berkeley group showed that in fact the chemical composition of the pieces matched that of pottery made in Cyprus, which meant it had later been exported to Palestine and other sites, a result that had extensive ramifications on the archaeology of the eastern Mediterranean.The Origin of the \\"Palestinian\\" Bichrome Ware\\", (with M. Artzy and I. Perlman), J. American Oriental Society 93, 1973 The Colossi of Memnon In 1973, Asaro and his colleagues embarked on a study of the Colossi of Memnon, two statues of Pharaoh Amenhotep III that have stood for 3400 years in the Theban necropolis, across the River Nile from the modern city of Luxor. Collaborating with Professor Robert Heizer and his research group in the Department of Anthropology and Archaeological Research at the University of California, Berkeley, the Asaro group analyzed the stone used to construct the statues. Erected in the early fourteenth century B.C. as guardians of the Mortuary Temple, the two 50-foot monoliths consist of a quartzose sandstone rock (quartzite) formed by quartz particles cemented with iron oxide. Archeologists had once believed that all the stone used to create the statues came from a quarry about 100 miles away from the temple site, near Aswan. Asaro's group determined that the original rock used to build the statues actually came from quarries 420 miles away in Cairo, Egypt and was transported overland to the final site, a remarkable feat of engineering for that time. Using neutron activation analysis, Asaro and his co-workers showed that the stone from Aswan was only used to repair the upper half of the northern statue, which had been knocked over in an earthquake about 27 B.C. and reconstructed by Roman emperor Septimius Severus about 197 A.D.\\"The Colossi of Memnon Revisited\\", (with R.F. Heizer, F. Stross, T.R. Hester, A. Albee, I. Perlman and H.R. Bowman), Science 182, 1973 The Plate of Brass The Plate of Brass, also known as Drake's Plate, is an artifact that English explorer Francis Drake purportedly left on the coast of what is now Marin County, in the San Francisco Bay Area of California, after his ship the Golden Hinde landed there in 1579. However, in 1977, Asaro and his colleague Helen Michel used neutron activation analysis to determine that the zinc content in the composition of the plate was too high and the impurity levels too low to come from techniques of sixteenth century English for working with brass. Instead, the plate was mostly likely manufactured in the first half of the nineteenth century or later.Drake's Plate -- the end of the mystery?Scientific Investigation of Copies, Fakes and Forgeries, Paul Craddock, Butterworth- Heinemann (March 9, 2009)\\"Chemical Study of the Plate of Brass\\", (with H.V. Michel), Archaeometry 21 No. 1, 1979 The Asteroid Impact Theory Asaro is best known as the nuclear chemist who discovered the iridium anomaly that led to the development of the asteroid impact theory to explain the mass extinctions, including the demise of the dinosaurs, that occurred at the end of the geological era known as the Cretaceous period in Earth's history.\\"Extraterrestrial Cause for the Cretaceous-Tertiary Extinction: Experiment and Theory\\", L.W. Alvarez, W.A. Alvarez. F. Asaro, and H.V. Michel), Science 208, 1980 (4448): 1095‚Äì1108. His part in the work began when Nobel Prize‚Äìwinning physicist Luis Alvarez and his son, geologist Walter Alvarez, asked Asaro to look for iridium in samples of earth from the layer between the Cretaceous and Paleogene periods. Their purpose was to discover if the composition of the boundary layer that represented the transition between those two periods could provide insight into how many years the layer represented. Asaro told the Alvarezes that the amount of iridium present in such samples of the Earth would almost certainly be too small to detect. However, he was interested in the project and agreed to perform the analysis, working with colleague Helen Michel. When they discovered remarkably high levels of iridium, he believed they had done the analysis incorrectly. He and Michel repeated the tests many times before bringing their results to Alvarez. Walter Alvarez has written, \\"Frank hunts down potential mistakes with the ruthlessness of a counterspy, triple checks everything, and then checks it again .... We know today what killed the dinosaurs because of Frank Asaro's ability to make these remarkable measurements.\\" The results were soon confirmed, not only for the samples provided by Alvarez, but independently by other groups around the world. That discovery resulted in the group, led by Luis Alvarez, to propose that an asteroid collided with the Earth and caused the mass extinctions. Although the theory is sometimes referred to as the Alvarez hypothesis, the seminal paper published in the literature was authored by Luis Alvarez, his son Walter, Frank Asaro, and Helen Michel. The theory was initially met with skepticism, but over the years has become accepted as the primary explanation of the mass extinctions that took place sixty-five million years ago.What Killed The Dinosaurs? Asaro himself felt that while mass extinction of many species was well-supported by plentiful fossil records, the smaller number of dinosaur fossils available worldwide made pinpointing cause of their extinction more difficult. In the March 5, 2010 edition of Science, an international panel of experts in geology, paleontology and related fields published the results of their exhaustive review of the data, ruling in favor of the asteroid theory.Alvarez Theory on Dinosaur Die-Out Upheld: Experts Find Asteroid Guilty of Killing the Dinosaurs Biography Asaro grew up in Escondido, California, the son of avocado farmer and barber Nicolo Asaro and Antonina (Annie) Asaro. He married Lucille Marie Lavezo and settled in the California Bay Area. They had four children, Frank, Antonina, Catherine, and Marianna. Asaro's mother, one of the oldest known residents of Escondido, lived until almost 106 years old.105-year-old birthday girl reveals longevity's secret: blackjackAntonina Asaro obituary Work by Asaro and other scientists who study archeological artifacts has become trendy in recent years with the popularity of science fiction shows such as Warehouse 13 and Stargate, where storylines involve archeological artifacts imbued with magical, scientific, or mystical powers.

His greatest works date from the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. The collapse of the central Tang government in 907, meant artists and craftsmen lost their most powerful patrons.Sullivan, Three Thousand Years of Chinese Painting, 88. The imperial Tang court had inspired a golden age of literature and art at its apogee. The various provincial courts who claimed to represent a continuation of the tradition of Tang government also claimed continuity in the arts and culture. The state of the Former Shu had acted as the traditional western sanctuary ever since Emperor Xuanzong had sought refuge there during the An Shi Rebellion in 755. By the collapse of the Tang Dynasty something like a miniature Tang court existed at Chengdu. Guanxiu arrived in chengdu in 901, and remained there until his death. Wang Jian, the founding emperor of the Former Shu, bestowed upon him the honorific title Great Master of the Chan Moon (Chanyue dashi), however he is still known by his monk's name Guanxiu, which means \\"a string of blessings\\". He is famed for his depiction of arhats, disciples of historical Buddha, who lived harsh ascetic lives.Sullivan, Three Thousand Years of Chinese Painting, 89. He is however also known for his works in poetry and calligraphy as well; extant works exist for all three forms. After Guanxiu's death, Shi Ke rose to prominence as Chan painter. Arhats One arhat depicted by Guanxiu In particular Guanxiu is known for his depiction of the eighteen arhats particular to Chinese Buddhism. Chinese artists had been depicting them with great expressiveness and power since the sixth century, however Guanxiu's interpretations are often seen to have captured another dimension. A set of sixteen arhats is preserved in the Japanese Imperial Household Collection. This collection bears an inscription dated to 894. It states Guanxiu began the set while living in Lanxi, Zhejiang province. Legend has it that the arhats, or \\"Luohans\\", knew of Guanxiu's expert calligraphy and painting skills, and so appeared to the monk in a dream to request that he paint their portraits. The paintings depicted them as foreigners having bushy eyebrows, large eyes, hanging cheeks and high noses. They were seated in landscapes, leaning against pine trees and stones. An additional theme in these paintings were that they were portrayed as being unkempt and \\"eccentric\\" which emphasizes that they are vagabonds and beggars who have left all worldly desires behind. When Guanxiu was asked how he came up with the depictions, he answered: \\"It was in a dream that I saw these Gods and Buddhas. After I woke up, I painted what I saw in the dream. So, I guess I can refer to these Luohans as 'Luohans in a dream'.\\" These portraits painted by Guanxiu has become the definitive images for the 18 Luohans in Chinese Buddhist iconography, although in modern depiction they bear more Sinitic features and at the same time lost their exaggerated foreign features in exchange for more exaggerated expressions. The paintings were donated by Guanxiu to the Shengyin Temple in Qiantang (present day Hangzhou) where they are preserved with great care and ceremonious respect. The Chan Buddhist tradition of painting sought to express the immediacy and intensity of the artists intuition as well as to record moments of truth in the form of Buddhas or arhats.Sullivan, The Arts of China, 172. Even by the end of the Tang Dynasty Chan painters were practicing wildly eccentric works, which unfortunately have only survived through contemporary descriptions. His depiction of the arhats exhibit an exaggeration of features that borders on perversity, this style is typically Chan. The paintings display an emphasis on the arhat's skeletal bodies, and bony faces, as well as the incredible age of the sages. According to Max Loehr, Guanxiu's arhats represent the physical embodiment of Buddhist persecution in eighth-century China. This persecution nearly obliterated the Buddhist establishment. The tormented faces are depicted as if the arhats themselves were survivors of the death and destruction. In Chinese painting the themes of pain, suffering, and death are depicted rarely outside of Buddhist art.Sullivan, Three Thousand Years of Chinese Painting, 89.

It is produced from cellulose and has received attention as a biofeedstock. It is a white solid, although commercial samples can appear yellowish or tan. Synthesis 2,5-BHMF may be obtained from the reduction of the formyl group of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). HMF is the product of acid-catalyzed dehydration of fructose. Fructose is both an isomer of and a derivative of glucose, which can be derived from the hydrolysis of cellulose. The reduction is catalyzed by nickel, copper chromite, platinum oxide, cobalt oxide, or molybdenum oxide, and sodium amalgam, under high temperatures and high hydrogen pressure. Hydrogenation in the presence of a copper or platinum catalyst in an aqueous environment gives 2,5-BHMF as the main product. Under more forcing conditions, the furan ring is reduced as well, resulting in 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydrofuran.

The resolution was sponsored by 60 countries. Its adoption was praised by Human Rights Watch, which called it \\"a tremendous step toward ending this horrendous practice\\". Observations In the preamble of the resolution, the Council expressed concern at the slow progress on the issue of sexual violence in armed conflict, particularly against women and children. Moreover, despite calls to all parties involved in conflict and condemnation, such acts continued to occur. It reminded all states to comply with international law and for leaders to demonstrate commitment to prevent sexual violence, combat impunity and uphold accountability, as inaction would send the wrong message. Perpetrators of war crimes and genocide had to prosecuted, emphasising the primary responsibility of states to respect and ensure human rights of people within their territory. The resolution noted that ending impunity was essential if a society was to recover from conflict, and in this regard, there needed to be better access to health care, psychosocial support, legal assistance and the needs of persons with disabilities. The Council recalled the number of sexual offences in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. It welcomed attempts to address the issue in peacekeeping missions, including tackling sexual violence and promoting the role of women in civil and military functions. Acts The Council condemned the widespread and systematic use of sexual abuse against the civilian population in situations of armed conflict, and that taking steps to combat it would contribute towards the maintenance of international peace and security. It called for an end to all acts of sexual violence. The Secretary-General was asked to include information on parties suspected to be responsible for acts of rape or other acts of sexual violence, which the Council would use to engage with the parties or take action against them. The list would be made public. The resolution asked parties to armed conflict to make commitments against the use of sexual violence and investigations into alleged abuses, which the Secretary-General was asked to monitor. The Council stated its intention to designate criteria pertaining to acts of rape and other forms of sexual violence when reviewing or adopting sanctions. Meanwhile, the Secretary-General was instructed to devise monitoring, analysis and reporting arrangements on conflict-related sexual violence, while ensuring full transparency. The Security Council praised the work of gender advisers and looked forward to the appointment of women protection advisers in peacekeeping missions. States were encouraged to use scenario-based training materials provided by the Secretary-General before the deployment of peacekeeping operations, with the Council pledging to pay attention to sexual violence in mandate renewals and authorisations. Furthermore, states were asked deploy greater numbers of female police and military personnel in peacekeeping operations. Finally, the Secretary-General was asked to strengthen the policy of zero tolerance on sexual exploitation and abuse by United Nations personnel, and report regularly to the Council on progress in implementing the current resolution.

It lies completely within Muhlenberg Township and relies on the municipal services of that township. Boundaries Originally, the name Riverview Park applied only to certain developments (see below). Today, the name has generally come to mean any area in Muhlenberg Township west of PA Route 61, excluding the older communities of Muhlenberg Park and Tuckerton. Riverview Park lies entirely within the 19605 ZIP code and is serviced by the Reading Post Office. The local school district is the Muhlenberg School District. History Riverview Park is a collection of mostly post‚ÄìWorld War II housing developments on the western side of Muhlenberg Township, with most of the development occurring between 1950 and 1975. Originally, the area was a patchwork of family farms, and the development tracts correspond roughly to the subdivision of those large parcels of land. Though development flourished in the late 1940s and early 1950s, plans to subdivide the western half of Muhlenberg Township were proposed in the early 20th century. The first subdivision of homes along River Road was actually recorded in the year 1913. The development was known as \\"River View\\", and was made up of land previously land owned by William Luden, the owner of Luden's Cough Drops. At one time, Luden operated a picnic grove and park for his employees on this site. A grand development known as \\"Hyroth\\" (a play on words for the subdivision of the High Estate) was proposed and recorded in 1926. This was the land north of Whitmer Rd to the Schuylkill River. Development never came to be, and the plan was declared void in favor of the newer plan for Whitford Hill (1974). The area known as Reading Crest was subdivided in 1924, although it was not fully developed until well into the 1990s. This was the area to the west of Reading Crest Avenue with Carolina Avenue on the south, Kentucky Avenue on the north and Hilltop Avenue on the west. George Eisenbrown's successful \\"Muhlenberg Park\\" development led him to divide a vast swath of land on the northern side of Leisz Bridge Road and to the west of Soudt's Ferry Bridge Road. The subdivision of lots was recorded in 1946 and was known as \\"Riverview Park\\". To serve the post-war population and development boom, an elementary school was constructed on Stoudt's Ferry Bridge Road just south of Hain Avenue. The school was sold around 1980 and is now the Calvary Church of the Nazarene. In 1947, Riverview Park Section 2 was divided. This is the area on both sides of Grandell Ave. Some of the other post‚ÄìWorld War II developments were Hain's Acres (1953), Sheidy Acres (1956), and Wheatland (1961). A second phase of development occurred on unbuilt lands (mostly in the far northwest corner of Muhlenberg Township) in the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. Some of these developments are Whitford Hill, Wilfox Acres, Rivers Bend, Eagle's Landing, King's View, and Heather Knoll. Originally, Bodey's School House educated the children of the area. The original school house is still standing along Stoudt's Ferry Bridge Road, though it has long since been converted for residential use. Older residents of Muhlenberg Township (and Berks County) will remember this house as the residence of Ralph Dunkleberger, a notable local artist. Today Riverview Park remains a desirable area of Muhlenberg Township. Many parks weave their way throughout the community, including Laurel Run, Laurelain Playground, Reading Crest Park, Felix Dam, and Stoudt's Ferry Playground. The Muhlenberg Township Recreation Building is located along River Road in this section of the Township. Most of this area is designated as R-1 or R-2 zoning, meaning only low to medium density residential structures are allowed. There are no commercial establishments in Riverview Park. The area has one municipal swimming pool - the Laurel Run Swimming Association (members only) located at 3500 Willow Grove Ave. There are two churches in the area - Good Shepherd Lutheran Church (at Stoudt's Ferry Bridge Road and Tuckerton Road) and Calvary Church of the Nazarene (located along Stoudt's Ferry Bridge Road).

This monument was built in the 12th century, coinciding with the establishment of the city itself. History Like so many monuments of central Iran, the Jameh Mosque of Saveh's core is of the 12th century, and its single surviving minaret is dated in 1110 and 1061. The proportions of its fa√ßade are also related to systems of proportion established in the 12th century, although the work itself is, apparently, of the early 16th. Recent discoveries indicate that the mosque might have been constructed on the foundations of an older mosque dating back to the 10th. Several inscriptions found in the mosque date back to the 10th century. Architecture and design The Jameh Mosque of Saveh comprises a courtyard, porch, a minaret, a few nocturnal areas, dome and two archaic altars with inscription in Kufic script. Two altars dating to the Safavid-era are adorned with inscriptions in Thuluth script. There are also other inscriptions, inscribed with sacred verses, in Kufic and Thuluth scripts. There is an elevated porch between two nocturnal areas in the western front, and at its either sides there exists several chambers. The mosque has a rectangular open court which is 36x44 meters and is surrounded by columns made of brick. In the west side of the open court, there is a large iwan; the iwan's height and width are nearly the same. The dome of this mosque is 14 meters in diameter and 16 meters high. Internally the dome has been adorned with tiles. The mosque, originally, had two minarets but only one minaret remains standing; the minaret is 14 meters in height and 3.5 meters in diameter. The superb, varied bands of raised brick patterns and inscriptions in Kufic and Naskhi scripts make this minaret the finest of the Seljuk period still standing. The upper section is missing and the lowest section of the remaining shaft has been restored with plain brick bond.

The unions demands shares of the profits of the factories.Redfern, William A. Sukarno's Guided Democracy and the Takeovers of Foreign Companies in Indonesia in the 1960s Serbuni initiated militant agitations at the time of the 1963/1964 Konfrontasi, following similar attacks at the British Embassy and Shell Oil installations. In December 1963 the organization began picketing Unilever factories. In the latter half of January 1964, the union tried to capture the Djakarta head office and factories of Unilever. On 18 January 1964 Serbuni seized control over the Angke factory in Djakarta. A statement issued by Serbuni claimed that the occupation was a reaction to Konfrontasi, British imperialism, seizure of two Hajj ships and statements made by president Sukarno. The unionists were however expelled by local police. The union tried to occupy the Colibri factory in Surabaya on 25 January 1964, but were evicted by police. At Angke a joint supervisory committee with Serbuni representation was instituted by the police, whilst at Colibri control was handed back to the Unilever management. David Kenneth Fieldhouse argues that Serbuni did not formally seize control of the Unilever factories, as foreign enterprises taken over by unions were nationalized by presidential decree. In the nationalized industries independent unions were banned, a move that would have threatened the position of Serbuni. Thus Fieldhouse states that Serbuni's actions at the time of Konfrontasi actually sought to prevent nationalization.

Background Coleridge embarked upon his tour of Germany with his close friend William Wordsworth in 1798 shortly after the publication of their Lyrical Ballads of 1798. It was in May 1799, the eleventh month of his tour, that he encountered the print in a village inn.

Introduction PUPS/P3 is a cluster computing environment derived from the MSPS operating environment implemented on the BBC Microcomputer. The PUPS P3 environment has been used in the infrastructure of a number of scientific computing projects include the Daisy automated species identification system and a number of computational neuroscience projects. Features of the P3 process PUPS/P3 processes are homeostatic agents. These agents are able to save their state and migrate between machines running compatible Linux kernels (via CRIU). The PUPS/P3 API also gives them significant access to the state of their environment: like biological organisms they are animate. That is, they are able to sense changes in their environment and respond appropriately. Fir example, a P3 process may elect to save its state or migrate if some resource, for example processor cycles become scarce. Effectively, this is the machine equivalent of an animal electing hibernate or migrate when its food resources become scarce. PUPS/P3 can also share data resources via a low level persistent object, the shared heap. The semantics of using this are similar to those used by the free()/malloc() API supplied by standard C libraries. Computations can be jointly executed by a cluster of co-operating P3 processes. This cluster is in many ways analalogous to a multicellular organism: like cells within an organisms, individual P3 processes can specialise. For example, in the case of the Daisy pattern recognition system, the cluster consists of (ipm) processes which pre-process pattern-data, (floret) processes which run the PSOM neural nets used to classify those patterns, and (vhtml) processes which communicate the identity of patterns Daisy has discovered to the user. In addition, the Daisy cluster also has specialist (maggot and kepher) processes to clear and recycle file and memory space and (lyosome) processes which destroy and replace other processes within the cluster which have become corrupted and therefore non functional. In conjunction with virtualisation systems, for example the Oracle VirtualBox system, it is possible to use PUPS/P3 to build homeostatic virtual (Linux) machines which can carry computational payloads while living in a dynamic cloud environment. The latest release of PUPS/P3 also supports container based operating system level virtualization (via Docker (software) and check pointing and subsequent migration and/or restoration via CRIU. P3 process network The P3 system facilitates dynamic asynchronous peer to peer communication between processes and also dynamic asynchronous communication between processes and the user. In the example process network shown, several of the communications methods implemented in PUPS/P3 are illustrated. These include: User to PSRP server via PSRP client (using PSRP protocol). This communication mode establishes an asynchronous pseudotty connection between the psrp client (and hence the user) and the PSRP server process. Peer to peer (between PSRP servers) via SIC channel. A PSRP server wishing to communicate directly with another server slaves an instance of the psrp client via a Slaved Interaction Client Channel (SIC). It then instructs this slaved psrp client to open a PSRP channel to the peer it wishes to talk to. Peer to peer (between PSRP servers) via sensitive file. In this mode a PSRP server sends data to another server via file. To prevent any server reading the file it tagged with a key which has a matching lock on the recipient server. This lock and key system was inspired by enzyme-substrate and biological signaling systems.

The wreck was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. History The steamer Henry Chisholm at the Northwest Coal Dock in Duluth, Minnesota The Henry Chisholm (Official number 95610) was built in 1880 at Thomas Quayle & Sons shipyards in Cleveland, Ohio, which was considered the best wooden shipbuilders on the Great Lakes. She was a 265-foot wooden steam- powered freighter, 39 feet in breadth and 20 feet in depth, carrying three masts and a double expansion steam engine with twin Scotch boilers capable of producing 1707HP, powering a single screw. The hull was reinforced with steel and iron strapping, and was the largest wooden \\"steam barge\\" ever built in Cleveland, approaching the practical size limit for a wooden vessel of its type. The ship cost $125,999 to build, and was launched on August 28, 1880. The ship was built for Alva Bradley of Cleveland, and named for Henry Chisholm, father of the steel industry in that city. It was used on the Great Lakes from the time it was built until 1898, and frequently set records for cargo capacity, often towing several barges at once. The wreck of the Chisholm The Chisholm left Duluth, Minnesota on October 16, 1898 bound for Buffalo, New York, carrying 92,000 bushels of barley and towing the 220-foot schooner John Martin. The next day a heavy storm blew in and the tow rope to the Martin was cast off. After the gale lessened, the Chisholm spent the next few days searching for the Martin. On October 20, 1898 the ship struck a reef near the Rock of Ages Light while attempting to enter Washington Harbor. Determining the hull was too badly damaged to refloat, the captain abandoned ship, sending several crewmembers to Victoria Harbor for assistance while taking the remainder of the crew into Washington Harbor. The Martin was later found, essentially unharmed and sailing under her own power. Salvage began almost immediately, but the ship broke up and sank during storms a week later. The Scotch boilers were salvaged in 1901, but by that time the engine had slid downhill away from the wreck. The Chisholm sat mostly undisturbed until she was rediscovered by sport divers in the 1960s. The wreck today The Henry Chisholm sits in waters of 80 to 150 feet, lying on its side. Portions of the wooden hull are intermingled with the wreckage of the Cumberland, which had sunk earlier in 1877. The stern of the ship is broken away from the rest of the wreckage, and sits some distance away. The steam engine, drive shaft and prop are intact in the stern section, sitting upright at the 120‚Äì150 foot depth. The steam engine is of the double expansion variety, 20 feet high, and is in nearly perfect condition, easily viewable and accessible through the sheared-off stern. Approximately 75 dives were made to the Chisholm in 2009 out of 1062 dives made to wrecks in the Isle Royale National Park.

He joined the Royal Army Medical Corps during the Second World War and rose to become a consultant psychiatrist with the rank of Brigadier. His son was Scottish lawyer Alan Rodger, Baron Rodger of Earlsferry, who became Lord President of the Court of Session and subsequently Justice of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom. Early life Rodger was born in Glasgow and educated at North Kelvinside School (merged with Cleveden Secondary School in the 1990s), before going on to study at the Medical School of the University of Glasgow (BSc 1927, MBChB 1929). After graduating and undertaking general medical training, he was appointed assistant to Sir David Henderson at the Glasgow Royal Mental Hospital at Gartnavel, and spent a year from 1931 to 1932 as assistant to Professor Adolph Meyer at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. Career Rodger returned to Glasgow in 1934 as Deputy Superintendent of the Royal Mental Hospital and Assistant Lecturer in Psychiatry at the University. He remained there until 1940, when he joined the Royal Army Medical Corps as a Specialist in Psychiatry. By 1944, he was Consultant in Psychiatry with the rank of Brigadier, and was stationed in India and the South East Asia Command area (Burma, Ceylon, India, Thailand, Indochina, Malaya and Singapore). He increased the profile of psychiatry within military medicine and established psychiatry as an important tool in selection of officers. After the War, in 1945, he returned to Scotland as Senior Commissioner of the General Board of Control for Scotland (replaced in 1960 by the Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland), but retained his connection to the Army throughout his life. In 1948, he was appointed to the new Chair of Psychological Medicine at the University of Glasgow. He developed his unit at Glasgow's Southern General Hospital into a strong component of the University's Medical School, and was instrumental in developing it into a leader in the development of psychiatry within hospitals and the combination of psychological medicine with neurological sciences. In 1972, the unit was formed into the Institute of Neurological Sciences, where the Glasgow Coma Scale was devised by Graham Teasdale and Bryan J. Jennett in 1974. He was an external examiner at Edinburgh and Leeds Universities. Rodger served on a number of government committees as well as the Committee on Mental Health of the World Health Organisation. He was Chairman of the Scottish Division of the Royal Medico-Psychological Association in 1962 and President of the Association nationally in 1965, and was awarded an honorary fellowship in 1972 for his efforts during its application to become a Royal College. He was appointed CBE in 1967.

Her parents were Caleb W. Hallowell, of the Hallowell Family, and Mary Morris Tyson Hallowell, who were married on June 11, 1840. Caleb Hallowell was a merchant in Philadelphia, who was born in 1815 and died of tuberculosis in 1858. Her mother was born in 1820 and died in 1913 in Moret, France. Mary and Caleb were both born into the Quaker (Society of Friends) faith, but by the time of their marriage Caleb \\"had left the meeting\\". Mary was then \\"read out of meeting for marrying out of unity,\\" meaning that she was temporarily or permanently disowned by the faith. Their children continued to have the influence of the Friends through their families. The Hallowells had six children born between 1841 and 1854. Listed chronologically, they are: Francis Perot, Morris Lewis, Lewis Morris, Sara Tyson, Marshall Tyson, and Elizabeth Tyson. Even though the family were Quakers, three of her brothers, Morris, Francis and Lewis, fought in the Civil War for the Union Army. Each of them sustained injuries and/or were sick during the war. During the Civil War, Mary played a leadership role in Tennessee serving Union Army soldiers and with others raised funds for the care of the sick and wounded Union troops for the Sanitary Commission in Philadelphia.Chicago Women History Topics.

She descended through her mother's lineage from Christopher Marshall who came to the United States from Ireland and settled in Pennsylvania. He was a Committee of Safety of Pennsylvania member. Based her relationship to Marshall, she was Daughters of the American Revolution. Mary, her mother, and her niece Harrier were members of the Paris, France chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution. John Hallowell (died 1706), a Quaker from England, was her father's ancestor. Career Hallowell worked in Paris and Chicago as an \\"influential\\" adviser and organizer of art exhibits. Early career At the age of 20 she moved with her mother to Chicago and developed a career as a modern art exhibition organizer. In 1870, she lived with four of her five siblings in her mother's house. Hallowell traveled to European art centers to arrange for works of art for the Inter-State Industrial Expositions in Chicago and worked with William Merritt Chase, James McNeill Whistler, John Singer Sargent, and other Barbizon and European schooled artists. In 1878 she organized the Inter-State Industrial Exposition of Chicago. She popularized Impressionist art in the city with exhibition of the works of Degas, Monet, Pissarrol Alfred Sisley, and Pierre Auguste Renoir in the 1890 Inter-State show. She was an agent for art collectors in Chicago, including Bertha Palmer. Hallowell helped to found the Palette Club, which was first called the Bohemian Art Club. She was also a member of the Antiquarian Society. Hallowell helped to promote the development of the Art Institute of Chicago. She had increasing responsibility in management of exhibitions. Carolyn Kinder Carr, author of Sara T. Hallowell: Forsaking Plain for Fancy, stated that she was the first woman in exhibition management. She was said to have been among a group of women who were students of the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. World's Exposition, 1893 Anders Zorn, Sarah Tyson Hallowell, 1893, The National Portrait Gallery, Washington, D.C. Hallowell was one of the agents and then assistant chief of the Department of Fine Arts for the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893 in Chicago. Initially she had applied for the position of chief. At that point she had a decade organizing large exhibitions and developing important relationships within the art community. Hallowell had powerful social and political backers by that time who lobbied for the role for her. Although she was an otherwise a \\"strong candidate\\" she was not made chief. Author Carolyn Kinder Carr said, \\"As newspaper accounts of the day made clear, her gender rendered her ineligible for this high-profile job.\\" Hallowell was responsible for collecting 19th-century European art and identifying candidates for painting of wall murals by women artists. Working predominantly from Paris and at the request of Berthe Palmer, Hallowell identified Mary MacMonnies and Mary Cassatt, who became one of her friends in the 1890s.

He was the builder of Siston Court in Gloucestershire, which survives largely unaltered since his time. His excessive speculation and borrowing caused the ruination of the Siston branch of the Denys family. Early life Sir Nicholas Poyntz, husband of Jane Berkeley, first cousin of Maurice Denys, in a drawing by Hans Holbein the Younger Denys was the second son of Sir William Denys (died 1533) of Dyrham, Gloucestershire, a courtier of King Henry VIII, by his second wife Anne Berkeley, daughter of Maurice Berkeley (1436‚Äì1506). His father‚Äôs first wife, whom he had married in about 1482 and who was short-lived, was Edith Twynyho, but she died young.She was a daughter of John Twynyho (died 1485), a rich cloth merchant of Cirencester, a member of parliament for Bristol in 1472-5 and in 1484, and sister-in-law to John Tame (died 1500), of Fairford, Glos., the business partner of John Twynyho. The marriage settlement is contained in a charter dated 21 Ed IV (1482) His father was a great-grandson of Sir Gilbert Denys (died 1422) of Waterton, Glamorgan, who had settled in Gloucestershire following his first marriage in 1379 to Margaret Corbet, heiress of Siston. Barrister Denys entered the Inner Temple in London, where he trained as a barrister. He was appointed Marshal (1542-44, 1546), Steward (1545-46) and Bencher (1547). St John's Gate, Clerkenwell in 1661, by Wenceslaus Hollar In 1537, King Henry VIII granted Denys the Receivership of the former Order of Saint John, suppressed in England during the Dissolution of the Monasteries. This considerable preferment may have been due to his eldest brother, Sir Walter Denys, having married Margaret Weston, a daughter of Sir Richard Weston, of Sutton Place, Surrey, the elder brother of Sir William Weston, the last Prior of the Order before its dissolution. Denys took up residence at St John's Gate, Clerkenwell, which had been the Order's headquarters, the chief residence there being the house by the Gate formerly occupied by Thomas Docwra, the last-but-one Prior. This had a great hall, a chapel, gardens and an orchard, and was later the residence of Lionel Cranfield, 1st Earl of Middlesex.'St John's Gate and St John's Lane ', in Survey of London: Volume 46, South and East Clerkenwell, ed. Philip Temple (London, 2008), pp. 142-163 Denys also resided at St John's Jerusalem, the Order‚Äôs former Commandery at Sutton-at-Hone in Kent. He continued as sole Receiver of the Order until 1544, and after that acted jointly with Thomas Poley.Stanley T. Bindoff, 'Denys, Sir Maurice', in The House of Commons: 1509-1558, vol. 2, pp. 31‚Äì33, 34-37 Arms of Denys, sculpted in stone on Siston Court leopard's faces or jessant-de-lys azure over all a bend engrailed of the third Denys later bought the ancestral Denys manor of Siston from his elder brother, Sir Walter, who had inherited it. This was perhaps in the year 1542, when his brother needed to obtain a Royal licence to sell him Kingston Russell,Letters and Papers of Henry VIII, vol. xvii, p. 443 and one of the brothers went on to build a new country house there, known as Siston Court. The evidence for Sir Maurice being the builder comes from a letter dated 1607 to Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury from an agent offering him the property for sale, which is summarised in the Cecil Papers: : > \\"Offers for sale the manor of Siston Glos., from Bath & from Bristol, > heretofore the land of Sir Morris Dennis, present owner Mr Weeks. There is a > new house of stone which cost ¬£3,000 built by Dennis; a park which will keep > 1,000 fallow deer & rich mines of coal which yield almost as great revenue > as the land\\".Cecil Papers, vol. 19, p. 433. (124.72) Siston was built at about the same time as two of Denys‚Äôs connections were also building nearby in Gloucestershire: Sir Nicholas Poyntz, the husband of his first cousin Jane Berkeley, at Newark Park near Wotton-Under-Edge, and Sir Richard Berkeley, his nephew at Stoke Park, Stoke Gifford. Denys borrowed heavily to buy not just Siston, but also other nearby estates, including Barton Regis, a former Royal manor in Kingswood Forest,Cecil Papers, vol. 24., 6/5/1609 a large part of the Forest itself, and Abson and Pucklechurch from the Earl of Pembroke, who had obtained Pucklechurch at the Dissolution, as well as other manors in Gloucestershire and other counties. Marriage On 3 February 1545, Denys married Elizabeth Statham (died 1572), the widow of Nicholas Statham (died 1538), a member of the Worshipful Company of Mercers. Her family name is not known. Statham had been admitted to the Mercers' Company in 1512 as an apprentice of Robert Imber. He served as one of the four wardens of the company in 1532, as Second House Warden. In 1535 he is recorded as having shipped, together with his son-in-law Vincent Randall, 349 Kerseys to Sinxen Mart as part of a company of 114 cloth shippers.Anne Sutton, p. 412, note 9 His will dated 1538 was \\"sparse\\" and \\"suggests a sombre support of the new ways\\" according to Anne Sutton.Anne Sutton, p. 392 He did not, as had previously been common among Roman Catholics, mention the Virgin Mary or his parish. His main bequest was of 500 marks to be lent to \\"the moost honnest, towarde and thryving yonge men\\" Anne Sutton, pp. 461-2, note 111 of the Mercers' Company. The interest therefrom, stipulated at 25 marks per annum, was directed to the use of St Bartholomew's Hospital \\"where the king's grace will thereto appoint and give licence\\". This was then a common way of making a religious bequest indirectly, at the politically sensitive time of the Reformation, after the abolition of the chantries. If his main bequest should have been disapproved, he provided that instead one hundred poor people of the City of London should be given black gowns. He left several small bequests. Elizabeth was his residuary legatee and sole executrix. The execution of Statham's bequest, however, seems to have been blocked by Elizabeth's new husband, Denys, and the money was not released until 1550, after Denys himself had been admitted gratis to the Mercers' Company Sutton, Anne F., The Mercery of London: Trade, Goods and People, 1130-1578, Aldershot, 2005, p. 548, short biog. of Nicholas Statham; p. 392, his will; p. 462, Denys admitted to Mercers At Brook Place, Sutton-at-Hone, Denys had previously built a great house for Statham.Ireland, William Henry. England's Topographer: or a New & Complete History of the County of Kent, 1830 The name \\"Brook Place\\" may have been its name after Statham's time, in recognition of the locally important family of George Brooke, 9th Baron Cobham. This house was later renamed \\"Sutton Place\\", partially demolished, and covered in white stucco. On his marriage to Elizabeth Statham, Denys gained possession of Brook Place, although following Denys's death it was inherited by Elizabeth's daughter, from her previous marriage,Ireland, W. H., A New & Complete History of the Co. of Kent, London, 1830. Vol. 4, Sutton, pp. 368-373 who had married the Mercer Vincent Randall, who became Master of the Mercers' Company in 1574. Elizabeth is known to have been an active supporter of the new Protestant religion, of the unorthodox Evangelical variety.Sutton, Anne F.

In 1550, when the tenant was Hugh Edwards, the Mercers' Company sold the house to Sir John Gresham. Sutton, Anne, p. 526 Hugh Latimer(martyred 1555), Robert Barnes, Thomas Garret and William Jerome, (martyred together in 1540) and other evangelicals, and in 1540 had been indicted under the first enquiry under the Six Articles to abolish \\"diversity in opinions\\". Bishop Bonner chaired the commission, which included at least 5 mercers: John Alen, Ralph Warren, Richard and John Gresham and Michael Dormer and Guy Crafford, the lawyer and grandson-in-law of Joan, Lady Bradbury. The worth of Elizabeth was then assessed at over ¬£500. In her will dated 1572PROB 11/27, folio 174, will of Elizabeth Denys she left several charitable bequests, to be distributed by the Dean of St Paul's, designed to encourage the new religion by funding poor scholars at the universities. She also left a bequest to Christ's Hospital. These bequests were opposed by her son-in-law, Randall, but were upheld by the probate court.Sutton, Anne, op.cit. p. 548; p. 392, note 75 re. bequest; PROB 11/56 folios 25-26 & 235v-36 for upholding of her wishes On 8 May 1544, shortly before her marriage to Denys, Elizabeth had acquired lands in Great Sankey, Warrington, Cheshire, from Sir Thomas Boteler, who very soon thereafter \\"made a forcible entry upon and a tortious possession of a messuage and lands in Sankey\\" on account of which he was sued, before the end of 1544, in the joint names of Elizabeth and Maurice Denys. The couple then sold their Sankey lands to Denys's brother-in-law Walter Bucler, who on 1 January 1547 exchanged them with the king for other lands in Sankey.Beaumont, William. Annals of the Lords of Warrington, 1872, Part 2 Acquires Wye College In 1546 Denys acquired Wye College, Kent, from Walter Buckler, who had been granted it by the crown following the Dissolution. Buckler was secretary to Queen Katherine Parr and the second husband of Katherine Denys, Maurice's sister, whose first husband had been Edmund Tame (died 1544) of Fairford, Gloucestershire.

(BL Cott. MS. Claud. CIII, f.157b) On 22 February 1547, two days after the coronation of King Edward VI, Denys was knighted, and in the same year he became a bencher of the Inner Temple and a Justice of the Peace for Gloucestershire and Kent, as well as being elected to the House of Commons as a Member of Parliament for Malmesbury in Wiltshire. Also in 1547, he sold some of his land in Clerkenwell to Sir Edward North (later 1st Baron North), who in 1545 following the Dissolution had acquired the nearby London Charterhouse and made it his London mansion. In May 1548 he sold the manor of Surrenden to Sir Anthony Aucher (d. 1558), of Otterden in Kent, a commissioner for that county, whose burial place in Bishopsbourne Church in Kent records as follows: > \\"Sr. Anthony AUCHER, Knt.

It stood between Great Sutton Strest and Clerkenwell Road.John Strype, \\"Survey of London\\" Treasurer of Calais In December 1548, under Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset (Protector Somerset), Denys was appointed Treasurer of Calais. His position required him to reside in Calais and proved an unhappy task, thanks chiefly to the shortage of funds. Calais was a personal possession of the English Crown, and such an appointment was a sign of great trust. His uncle Maurice Berkeley, de jure 4th Baron Berkeley (1467‚Äì1523) had been appointed Governor of Calais, but died there in 1523 before he had taken up the post. In April 1550, the Privy Council rebuked Denys for his caution in pressing Lord Clinton (as he then was) not to release Boulogne to the French until they had paid a treaty obligation under the Peace of Boulogne. In February 1551, after power had passed to Northumberland, Denys was granted a pension of ¬£150 a year for life. Committed to Fleet prison In June 1552, commissioners were sent to audit Denys's accounts and in July they were ordered to investigate what had been done with money he said he had not received. On 20 November he was called back to England and on the 26th was imprisoned in the Fleet. He was summoned to present himself to the Council on 29 January 1553, with commissioners to examine his case in April. Between May and August he appears to have been back in post as Treasurer of Calais, as he was receiving new instructions, but on 12 September was again committed to the Fleet, in due course to be released again. By now, Denys's wide-reaching purchases were proving too ambitious, and debts weighed on him heavily. He sold several estates, probably to defray debts incurred in his post at Calais. In 1553, he sold Wye College in Kent to Sir William Damsell.Bindoff, op. cit., vol. 4, p. 9 Siston was also mortgaged to Rowland Hayward before his death to satisfy his creditors. Greets Cardinal Pole On 18 November 1554, under Queen Mary I, who had returned England to the Church of Rome, Denys was ordered by the Privy Council to go to Rochester to join Lord Cobham in welcoming Cardinal Pole back from his exile. Pole rapidly became one of the main forces behind the burning of many English protestant martyrs. Denys had no other government work under Mary, which may have been connected not only with his debts but also with his religious sympathies. In August 1556, Denys failed to honour two payments to the Crown, one of 1,000 marks and one of ¬£579, so was forced to pledge his manor of Burton in Gloucestershire, and in February 1557 he sold other estates around Bristol. Denys was pardoned and rehabilitated by Queen Elizabeth I in January 1559 and began to resume his career. Death In November 1562 Denys was at Portsmouth to pay soldiers and may have remained there. He died at Portsmouth on 25 August 1563, probably of the plague, which had broken out there. The \\"Cecil Papers\\" at Hatfield House contain the following entry, which followed a similar one three days before: > \\"Sir Adrian Poynings to the Queen. Concerning the state of payments to the > troops from Newhaven (i.e. Le Havre) at the death of Sir Maurice Denis (sic) > Treasurer. Wherwell 28 August 1563.Cecil Papers, vol 1. no.924 Denys had made a complicated Will on 29 October 1562, which was proved on 29 January 1564, after William Paulet, 1st Marquess of Winchester had ordered the Prerogative Court of Canterbury to take over the administration of Denys's estates \\"for the ease of my Lady Denys, who minds not to take any charge of her late husband's testaments because his debt to the Queen's Highness is not known\\". Succession At his death Denys left a large debt of ¬£7,500 due to the Crown. His heir to his surviving estates, including Siston, was his nephew Richard Denys (1525-1594),History of Parliament biography a member of parliament, son and heir of his elder brother Sir Walter Denys (c.1501-1571), of Dyrham. The inheritance of such a debt was a burden to Richard, who had also inherited debts from his own father, largely contracted due to his entanglement in Sir Maurice's land purchases and speculations.In 1554 the Council ordered bonds to be taken from Sir Walter and his brother Maurice for payment of ¬£5,486 owing from the latter, per History of Parliament biography of Sir Walter Denys (by 1501-1571) Richard appears to have redeemed the mortgage to Sir Rowland Hayward (c.1520-1593), twice Lord Mayor of London, but in his desperation to retain Siston turned to fraud. In 1568 he sold Siston to Richard Wyke\\"Wyke\\", as he spelled his own name in his letter to Sir Robert Cecil, dated 13 December 1607, Cecil Papers at Hatfield House, CP123/113, Calendar of the Cecil Papers in Hatfield House, Volume 19 (1607), pp.374-5. Originally published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office, London, 1965 (alias Week, Weeks) for ¬£3,200, but although he had received part of the purchase price, he refused to complete the transaction.

Originally published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office, London, 1965 Nevertheless in 1576 Richard Denys purported fraudulently to convey Siston to the Crown, as security for having been granted the right to pay off his debt of ¬£7,500 in annual instalments of ¬£100, and was returned ¬£1,500 of Sir Maurice's other assets previously seized by the Crown as security. This was a very favourable deal, as Cecil noted, for the ¬£1,500 on its own could be converted into a perpetuity producing an income of ¬£100 per annum to repay the debt due to the Crown.Equating to an interest rate of 6 2/3% He then attempted to evict Wyke from possession. However, clearly Siston was no longer his property to utilise in such way as security, and his scheme ultimately failed. The sequence of events of Richard Denys's fraudulent scheme are well recorded, in the handwriting of no less a legal expert that Sir Robert Cecil, who in 1607 had been offered the opportunity to purchase Siston by Robert Wyke, then in the Wood Street Compter debtors' prison.Letter from Robert Wyke to Cecil, dated 13 December 1607, Cecil papers, CP123/113, He examined in great detail the facts of the devolution of title from Sir Maurice Denys and recorded his findings in his papers, which survive in the Cecil Papers in Hatfield House.

More than 250 people were involved, including 50 persons interned in asylums and 7 deaths. A foodborne illness was suspected, and among these it was originally believed to be a case of \\"cursed bread\\" (pain maudit). A majority of academic sources accept ergot poisoning as the cause of the epidemic, while a few theorize other causes such as poisoning by mercury, mycotoxins, or nitrogen trichloride.  Background  During the Vichy government, the supply of grains from field to mill to bakery was directed by the government's grain control board, the Office National Interprofessionnel des C√©r√©ales (ONIC), and later the Union Meuniere. Essentially, this created a government monopoly on the sale of flour, allowing the government a measure of control over wartime supply shortages. This also meant that flour would be purchased directly from ONIC, and delivered to the baker for a set price, without the baker being able to have any control on quality. Following the end of the second world war, this system is relaxed, allowing for bakers to have some choice over their flour supply. The ONIC would retain its monopoly on inter-departmental exportation and importation. This system meant that millers in departments with more supply than demand could sell the excess to ONIC. In practice, this meant that the higher-quality flour would be delivered to local bakers, and lower quality flour would be exported to other departments. As such, departments with net flour deficit, like the Gard department in which is located Pont-Saint-Esprit, would be supplied with lower quality flour from other departments through the intermediary of ONIC, with the bakers having virtually no choice in the decision of the provenance or quality of their flour.  Previous sanitary events  In the weeks preceding the outbreak, a number of villages near Pont-Saint-Esprit reported outbreaks of food poisoning via bread. These outbreaks are all linked to bakeries that make their bread with most if not all of their flour supplied by the mill of Maurice Maillet, in Saint-Martin-la-Riviere. The symptoms reported are milder than those reported in Pont-Saint-Esprit. At Issirac, at least 20 people report cutaneous eruptions, diarrhea, vomiting and headaches. Similar symptoms are reported in Laval-Saint-Roman. Multiple families are reported sick in Goudargues and Lamotte-du-Rhone. In Connaux, the town‚Äôs baker receives reports from his clients that they believe his bread is causing violent diarrhea. He reports that his family, as well as himself, are all suffering from the same afflictions. The baker is quick to blame his flour, which he describes as ‚Äúbad, forming a sticky dough with acid fermentation‚Äù and which makes gray and sticky bread. In Saint-Genies-de-Comolas, the town‚Äôs mayor is alerted by one of the town‚Äôs two bakers that he received flour that was gray and full of worms. The mayor banned making bread with that flour, and referred the situation to the regions prefect, as well as to the driver that delivered the flour. The delivery driver, Jean Bousquet, would expedite to the prefect a copy of a remark made to his employer, the miller‚Äôs union in Nimes, on 9 August. In which, he writes that ‚Äúalmost every baker of Centre de Bagnols/C√®ze has complained of the quality of the flour provided by Mr. Maillet‚Äù. Following the incident at Connaux, Bousquet would request immediate written instructions from his employer regarding the situation. On the 13th of August, he requested that samples were to be taken to determine if the flour was contaminated. During this period, 42 bakers would complain of the flour delivered by Bousquet.  Mass poisoning  On the 16th of August 1951, the local offices of the town's two doctors were filled with patients reporting similar food poisoning symptoms; nausea, vomiting, cold chills, heat waves. These symptoms would eventually worsen, with added hallucinatory crises and convulsions. The situation in the town deteriorates in the following days. On the night of the 24th, a man believes himself to be an airplane and dies by jumping from a second-storey window and across town, an 11-year old boy strangles his mother. One of the town's two doctors would name the night nuit d'apocalypse; apocalyptic night.  Epidemiological investigation  Doctors Vieu and Gabbai investigated the epidemiology of the disease. On the 19th, they came to the conclusion that bread was to blame; all patients interrogated had purchased their bread at the Briand bakery in Pont-Saint-Esprit. A family from a neighboring village who had 4 out of 9 members fall ill showed that all members who ate bread from the Briand bakery fell ill, while none of the others who ate bread from another bakery did. Another family shared a loaf of Briand‚Äôs bread amongst 5 of the 7 members, the others preferring biscottes, with only the 5 falling ill. On the morning of the 20th, the health service, the prefecture, the prosecutor of the Republic and the police were notified. Roch Briand is interrogated, and finds himself surprised that the sickness that has befallen the town is blamed on his bread.  Criminal investigation  The police investigation would eventually center on the second of three batches of bread made at Briand‚Äôs bakery on the day of 16 August. The flour composition of each batch varied, as having run out of flour during the preparation of the second batch, Briand had borrowed flour from two other local bakers, Jaussent and Fallavet. Briand‚Äôs assistant would indicate that when he picked up flour from Jaussent, the baker was out ill, and took the flour from his assistant instead. Both Briand and his assistant would agree that the first batch was constituted of the previous day‚Äôs flour mixed with flour borrowed from Jaussent. They disagree on the second and third batch, while Briand states that the 2nd was made with Jaussent‚Äôs flour and the 3rd made with Fallavet‚Äôs flour, the assistant stated that both latter batches were made with a mix of the two. The investigation would lead police to interrogate many of the town‚Äôs residents, who would give inconsistent ratings on Briand‚Äôs tainted batch. Some reported that the taste was perfectly normal, while others reported chemical smells (one would relate it as an odor of gasoline, another would liken it to bleach), some reported that the bread looked normal, while others stated that its appearance was grayish.  Inquiry  On the 23rd of August, a judge of inquiry opened a formal investigation, and tasked commissaire Georges Sigaud with finding the cause of the mass poisoning event. The tainted bread made by Briand was made with only 4 ingredients; flour, yeast, water and salt. It was possible to easily discount all ingredients but flour as potential vectors for the illness. The water used to made the bread was from a municipal source, the same that also supplied the rest of the village. Both the salt and the yeast used by Briand were sourced from the same suppliers as all other bakers in the region, and subsequent testing of the supplies found no toxicity. The investigation of the provenance of the flour lead Sigaud to the UM-Gard flour distribution centre, in Bagnols-sur-C√®ze. The chief of the distribution network, Jean Bousquet, stated that since the end of July, the vast majority of the flour supplying the region was from two mills; one in Ch√¢tillon-sur-Indre, and the other being the mill of Maurice Maillet in Saint-Martin-la-Rivi√®re, the latter of which was the subject of numerous complaints with regards to the quality of its flour.  Maurice Maillet  In an interrogation that lasted multiple hours, Maurice Maillet denied mixing rye (which is highly suceptible to ergot) into his flour; opting instead to cut his product with 2% of bean flour. This was unusual, since due to a shortage of wheat, ONIC would mandate that rye flour be mixed in. However, in the Vienne department, rye of good quality was often more expensive than wheat, and as such, bean flour was authorised by ONIC as a replacement. Despite this, it came to light that the supply of grains to be milled for export was sometimes mixed with grains milled in an informal agreement called √©changisme. Under this type of agreement, often practiced at the time, a farmer would bring a baker grain they grew themselves in exchange for bread that would later be made with his grain. The baker would bring the grains to the miller, who would mill the grains. The miller and baker would each take a cut for sale. During the interrogation, Maillet would admit that he had made a deal with a baker, Guy Bru√®re, who had brought in bags to be milled. Since this was nearing the end of the season, the bags were filled with leftover grains that, sometimes, contained a high proportion of rye. The rye was not the only problem with the flour; as the miller also noted the presence of weevils, mites and dust. The baker was concerned that he would lose business should he refuse the grains on the basis of quality. Despite the miller having picked up on the low quality of the grains, he would nevertheless agree to exchange the grains for a lower quantity of flour already milled from grains marked for exportation. Being that the quantity of lower quality grains was eclipsed by the vast amount of grains for export, the miller thought that it would be possible to mix it all without decreasing the overall quality of the flour.  Arrests and trial  On the 31st of August, around 14:30, Sigaud addresses the media, announcing the arrests of Maillet and Bru√®re for involuntary manslaughter and involuntary injuries regarding their negligence in trading improper flour. Further arrests are made in the following days; an employee of Maillet, Andr√© Bertrand, is arrested, but released on bail as he is the head of a family of 9 whose wife is about to give birth. Additionally, the owners of the bakery at which Bru√®re was employed, Clothaire and Denise Audidier, are arrested for infractions to fiscal legislation and infraction regarding the legislation on wheat and flour. Scientific publishing Shortly after the incident, in September 1951, Dr. Gabbai joined by a few collegues published a paper in the British Medical Journal declaring that \\"the outbreak of poisoning\\" was produced by ergot fungus. The victims appeared to have one common connection. They had eaten bread from the bakery of Roch Briand who was subsequently blamed for using flour made from contaminated rye. Additionally, animals who had eaten the bread were found to have also perished. According to reports at the time, the flour had been contaminated by a fungus known as Claviceps Purpurea (ergot) which produces alkaloids similar to the hallucinogenic drug lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). Other theories Later investigations suggested mercury poisoning due to the use of Panogen or other fungicides used to treat grains and seeds.Jonathan Ott, Pharmacotheon: Entheogenic Drugs, their Plant Sources and History (Kennewick, W.A.: Natural Products Co., 1993), pg. 145. See also Dr. Albert Hofmann, LSD: My Problem Child (New York, N.Y.: McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1980), Chapter 1: \\"How LSD Originated,\\" pg. 6. This type of contamination was considered due to some fluorescent stains being present on the outside of some used empty flour bags returned to the distributor. Panogen was sold containing a red colorant as a safety measure, to ensure that seeds coated with it be used for planting only. Subsequent scientific tests showed that this coloring would not permeate through flour bags, but the active ingredient could do so. This would allow for thorough contamination of the flour, but would appear to be limited to the bags. Further testing showed that if bread were to be baked using Panogen- contaminated flour, the rising of the bread could be partially or totally inhibited, depending on the concentration. This hypothesis was considered thoroughly in a French civil trial regarding the accident, with the contamination mechanism being a train wagon carrying flour that could have previously carried concentrated cylinders of Panogen intended for agricultural uses. It was later discovered that pre-treating the seeds in Panogen could lead to mercury accumulation in the plants growing from those seeds. For this reason, Panogen, made by a Swedish company, was banned in Sweden in 1966. A revised version of the ban, in 1970, would prohibit the exportation of Panogen, leading to its removal from the market. In 1982, a French researcher suggested Aspergillus fumigatus, a toxic fungus produced in grain silos, as a potential culprit. Historian Steven Kaplan‚Äôs 2008 book, Le Pain Maudit argues that the poisoning might have been caused by nitrogen trichloride used to artificially (and illegally) bleach flour.Quand le pain empoisonne, La Vie des id√©es, 3 September 2008 (in French)  Conspiracy theory  In his 2009 book, A Terrible Mistake, author Hank P. Albarelli Jr originated a conspiracy theory claiming that the Special Operations Division of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) tested the use of LSD on the population of Pont- Saint-Esprit as part of its MKNAOMI biological warfare program in a field test called ‚ÄúProject SPAN‚Äù. In popular culture Barbara Comyns wrote her third novel, Who Was Changed and Who Was Dead (1954), after reading about the poisoning.

Dmitry Smolsky was the father of Victor Smolski, guitarist of the German sympho metal band Almanac. Early life Dmitry Smolski was born on July 25, 1937, in Minsk in the family of a famous Belarusian musicologist Bronislaw Smolski. A musical environment surrounded him from early childhood contributed to an early demonstration of his musical talent (the first musical publication of the young composer refers to the age of 12). At the age of seven, Dmitry began regular music lessons (violin), first in the Moscow Central Music School and then at the Music School of Belarusian State Conservatory, where he also started to learn composition under the leadership of a famous Belarusian composer Evgeniy Tikotski. In 1955, Smolski entered the Moscow Conservatory to the class of prof. Yuri Shaporin, but a year later he had to return to Minsk for health reasons. D. Smolski graduated from the Belarusian State Conservatory, where he studied in the composition class of prof. A. Bogatyrev (1960), followed by post-graduate studies in Moscow Conservatory under the guidance of prof. Nikolay Peyko (1967). Career From 1962 till 2014 D. Smolski taught composition at the Belarusian State Academy of Music. The main facts of the biography of Dmitry Smolski were illustrated in the Belarusian film \\"10 Revelations of Dmitry Smolski\\" (author T. Dubkova). Creative path Creative path of Dmitry Smolski which began in the late 1950s is the brightest page in the history of modern music. He is one of those composers who created a completely new trend in the Belarusian music of the late 1960s ‚Äì early 1970s and demonstrated a fundamentally new attitude to the art of composing. Brilliant talent and mastery in modern composing techniques (D. Smolski had a lively interest in European avant-garde of the 1960s) became the basis of a rare form of perfection in all his works. The unique author's nature of composing allows listeners and connoisseurs to talk about an outstanding ‚ÄúSmolski‚Äôs tone‚Äù. Dmitry Smolski was not afraid to enter into a confrontation with the generally accepted semi-official style prevailing in the Belarusian art at that time. He created the original symphony \\"Oktofoniya\\" (1967) and chamber oratorio \\"Song of Hiroshima\\" on the poems by Japanese poets (1965). Both artworks were written in the serial technique. In those years Smolski often used elements of avant-garde style in his chamber music. We can‚Äôt help mentioning his great works with elements of humor (Concertino for violin, Variations for wind instruments and percussion). In the later works, this gentle humor turned into sarcasm with elements of tragic farce (Variations with the Belarusian mentality, 15th Symphony, parts of other symphonies, etc.). The main theme of Smolski‚Äôs works has always been philosophical understanding of human life and destiny in a totalitarian society, the depth of psychological state of the person in dramatic situations. Each of his 15 symphonies reflects dramatic, tragic or sarcastic aspects of the complex individual experiences in the interaction with aggression or indifference of the world. Dmitry Smolski not only created his majestic symphonies but also enriched Belarusian musical history with his operas \\"Hoary Legend\\" (based on the novel by V. Karatkevich) and \\"Francis Skaryna\\"; monumental oratorios \\"My Motherland\\" (based on poems of Belarusian poets) and \\"Poet\\" (based on the work and life of famous Belarusian poet Yanka Kupala); instrumental concerts (for piano, violin, cello, cymbals); chamber instrumental and vocal compositions. Smolski‚Äôs music was played successfully in many countries (Germany, France, Italy, Russia, South Korea, USA, etc.). The CD with the recordings of his symphonies released by the British \\"Olympia\\" was the best on the CD Contest in the USA in 1992. Dmitry Smolski was also a wonderful teacher. He worked in the Belarusian State Conservatory (now the Belarusian State Academy of Music) more than a half of the century. During that time he has taught several generations of famous composers, winners of national awards, associated professors - in short, those people whose works create the face of modern Belarusian music. Dmitry Smolsky died on September 29, 2017.

CNN featured \\"Bird in Flight\\" during a story about the 50th anniversary of the first spacewalk by NASA astronauts and featured the title track on Newsroom, during a special segment on NASA's definitive discovery of flowing water on Mars. The HLN news series Raising America with Kyra Phillips selected one of the album's tracks, \\"When I Close My Eyes,\\" as the show's theme song. HuffPost's review of Water on Mars described the album as one that \\"makes a bold, tuneful impression on today's indie-pop landscape\\" and that it \\"is one of the year's smartest, not-to-be- missed debuts.\\" The Monterey County Weekly described ShyBoy's music as \\"a cross-pollination of RJD2, DJ Shadow and 2001: A Space Odyssey ‚Äì Arnold's understated vocals quickly erupt into full-blown soulful crooning that's irresistible for eardrums.\\" Kevin Bronson's Buzzbands LA noted ShyBoy's sound as \\"wonderfully dramatic,\\" and described his music as a cross between Nick Drake, Sufjan Stevens, and M83.

He served as the president of several normal schools and educational associations along the eastern seaboard. Most notably, he served as the founder and president of the National Education Association (NEA), and president of the American Normal School Association from 1856 to 1900 (44 years). He also served as the vice-president of the first International Conference of Educators, over which he presided at the centennial exposition in 1876.  Personal life  Phelps was born in Auburn, New York, the son of Halsey and Lucinda (n√©e Hitchcock) Phelps. He was descended from the puritan colonist, William Phelps. He studied at Auburn Academy and Auburn High School. In 1844, Phelps was appointed as a promising student from Cayuga County, New York to attend the New York State Normal School. This opportunity required a transfer to Albany. Phelps graduated with honors in 1846 from the first class of the Normal School in Albany and went on to teach at its Model School. In 1852, Phelps was awarded an A.M. (artium magister) degree, also known as a master's degree from Union College in Schenectady, New York. He married Carolyn Chapman, daughter of William Chapman of Albany, New York, and widow of Crawford Livingston. They had one daughter, Alice Livingston Phelps.  Professional background  In 1855, he was elected first principal of the New Jersey State Normal School at Trenton. A normal school was a school created to train high school graduates to be teachers. The following year he also became responsible for the Farnum Preparatory School in Beverly, New Jersey. He maintained responsibility for both offices until 1864. During this time he concurrently held the positions of president of the American Normal School Association from 1856 until 1860, as well as president of the National Educational Convention. Phelps Hall on the main campus of the Minnesota State Normal School, now known as Winona State University In 1864, Phelps became the president of the first Minnesota State Normal School in Winona. He served in this role for 12 years. During this same time period, he was also the editor-in-chief of the Chicago Educational Weekly from 1867 to 1868. In 1875, Phelps published two volumes of reports on the New Jersey and Minnesota normal schools, The Teachers' Handbook (1875, which was translated into Spanish for the use of the Argentine Republic). The following year he moved to Wisconsin, where he served as the vice-president of the first International Conference of Educators. He also became the president of the Wisconsin State Normal School for two years. Additional published works by Phelps include five brochures for the Chautauqua Literary and Scientific Circle (CLSC), founded in 1878 by Bishop Vincent. Donated works include \\"What is Education?\\" \\"Socrates\\", \\"Horace Mann\\", \\"Pestalozzi and Froebel\\", and \\"John Sturm\\". Phelps also offered several reports of the New Jersey and Minnesota normal schools. In 1878, Phelps received a silver medal from the Paris exposition as an educational collaborator and author. In 1879 he returned to Minnesota, where he was Superintendent of Public Schools from 1879 to 1881 and again from 1883 to 1885. He also served as the secretary of the Winona Board of Trade from 1878 to 1885, secretary of the St. Paul Chamber of Commerce from 1886 to 1887, and secretary of the Duluth Chamber of Commerce from 1887 to 1890.

At least one prototype was constructed and tested, although no production vehicles were built or saw service.  Project Prodigal  The vehicle was developed as part of Project Prodigal, which give rise to the CVR(T) series of British light tanks and related vehicles. as research into future armoured fighting vehicles. The intention was to produce an air- portable tank destroyer. The vehicle was to provide for a flexible strategic response to conflicts around the vestiges of the Empire. Despite the low intensity of such conflicts, it was assumed that the increasing supply of Soviet T-54 tanks to satellite states would require an anti-tank capability greater than previous light tanks. This was not seen as a substitute for a main battle tank, which would have to be heavily armed to deal with the massed and thickly armoured Soviet tanks of the Cold War. In particular, there was no attempt made at protection against the NBC threat that was expected for any European conflict.  Contentious  A particularly lightweight vehicle was needed, which restricted the possibility of a conventional tank with a conventional turret. The path chosen was that of a low-profile open hull with a semi-fixed gun, similar to the layout of the wartime Alecto. The small hull could accommodate only a crew of two, which in turn required an autoloader, particularly for the heavy armament and ammunition in mind. The gun chosen was the QF 20 pounder (84 mm), already in use in the Centurion tank, with the autoloader. The mount was fixed in elevation and had only a limited traverse. Most aiming relied on steering the entire tank on its tracks. Elevation used an unusual system, a hydraulic suspension system, with independent height control of each wheel station, which allowed the tank chassis to be tilted back and forth. This system had already been demonstrated in the Swedish S-tank. The chassis components were based on those of the Comet tank, although with only four road wheels rather than the Comet's five. The prototype was completed and tested on the firing ranges of Kirkcudbright Training Area. This was only a boilerplate example; it was unarmoured and the armour layout design had not been completed and the body of relatively high and vertical plates is unlikely to have been the shape or the material used for a final example. In particular, the petrol tanks were exposed and mounted above the track guards. The vehicle was also tested at Lulworth, in tests against a wheeled vehicle to test the virtues of tracked and wheeled arrangements for the Prodigal air- portable tank destroyer. The vehicle chosen was the Rhino, a six-wheeled skid- steered experimental chassis, powered by a Rolls-Royce Meteorite engine. Drivers were instructed to drive in pursuit of fixed and moving targets and to track them with a simple windscreen-mounted sight. The Rhinos steering was infamously imprecise and it was found that the tracked Contentious performed better. As with the Centurion, Contentious was later up-gunned; first tested with the 84 mm 20 pounder, the Bovington example later gained a L7 105 mm gun, derived from the 20 pounder. The replacement was relatively easy, as the 105 mm is largely a rebarrelled version of the 84 mm and has a similar breech. Photographs of the prototype do show some change to the recoil cylinders between the two.  Twin recoilless design  A further design for the Prodigal requirement used a pair of the 120 mm recoilless rifles, as used for the WOMBAT, fitted with seven-round revolver autoloaders. (period drawings of the concept vehicle) The rifles were on a swivelling mounting above a low boat-shaped hull with conventional suspension, crewed by a commander-driver- gunner. The mounting could elevate conventionally. The autoloaders and their ammunition were carried in armoured boxes above the hull, with the reaction nozzles of the recoilless rifle protruding behind.AVIA 67/18 Combustible cartridge cases in aid of project PRODIGAL 1961‚Äì1963 WAE/244/02 Pt A, National Archives, Kew Sighting for these recoilless rifles was to be the same M8C .50 spotting rifles, one for each barrel, as used with the WOMBAT.

The ranch is now administered by the Bureau of Land Management. The remaining historic ranch buildings are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  Early history  The Shirk Ranch is located on Bureau of Land Management property in the remote Guano Valley of southeastern Oregon. The ranch complex is in the Oregon high desert, just south of the Hart Mountain National Antelope Refuge in the northwest corner of the Great Basin region of North America. Native peoples inhabited the area for at least 10,000 years prior to the arrival of European explorers. The Northern Paiutes occupied the area prior to the arrival of European settlers. They had adapted to the high desert environment by living in scattered groups and moving frequently to take advantage of season lakes and migrating game animals.\\"David L. Shirk Ranch\\", National Register of Historic Places Registration Form, National Park Service, United States Department of Interior, Washington, D.C., 24 September 2009.Housley, Lucile A., \\"Guano Creek/Sink Lakes\\", Kalmiopsis (Vol. 11), Native Plant Society of Oregon, Eugene, Oregon, p. 10. In the first half of the 19th century, the area around the Shirk Ranch was explored by trappers and several military expeditions. In 1865, the United States Army built Old Camp Warner on the southeastern slope of Hart Mountain along upper Guano Creek. However, the post was abandoned within a year.McArthur, Lewis A. and Lewis L. McArthur, \\"Camp Warner\\", Oregon Geographic Names (Seventh Edition), Oregon Historical Society Press, Portland, Oregon, 2003, pp. 152-153. A few years later, the Oregon Central Military Wagon Road was built through the Guano Valley on its way from Eugene, Oregon to Silver City, Idaho. However, that venture was really a scam intended to acquire government land rather than create a viable road. As a result, the \\"road\\" was never more than a desert track.\\"Oregon History: Uncle Sam‚Äôs Handiwork\\",Oregon Blue Book, Oregon State Archives, Office of the Secretary of State, State of Oregon, Salem, Oregon, 17 September 2009. There was no permanent settlement in the area until a decade later when cattlemen began to take advantage of the open range in southeastern Oregon for grazing. The Shirk Ranch property was originally homesteaded by R.A. Turner around 1881 and then sold to William Herron. Shirk bought the ranch from Herron in 1883. When Shirk purchased the land, there were three building on the property, a house and two sheds. There is no record of the size of the property when Shirk bought it, but county tax records show the ranch was 480 acres in 1887.\\"Shirk Ranch\\", Cultural Resource Inventory: Sheldon National Wildlife Refuge and Hart Mountain National Wildlife Refuge, United States Fish and Wildlife Service, United States Department of Interior, Portland, Oregon, February 1985, pp 57-70.  David Shirk  David L. Shirk was born in Parke County, Indiana in 1844. He was the oldest of nine children. He left home at the age of 22 to travel west. He spent several years working as a cowboy on cattle drives from Texas to southern Idaho. His younger brother William joined him in 1874, and together they moved to Oregon. They both made land claims in the Catlow Valley in what is now Harney County, Oregon. David Shirk at age 28Later, the brothers acquired land in neighboring Guano Valley, approximately 50 miles west of their Catlow Valley ranch. They used the Guano Valley ranch to raise horses, while their main Catlow Valley ranch was a cattle operation. They were successful enough at their cattle business that their ranch became the social center for the local ranching community.Jackman, E. R. and John Scharff, Steens Mountain in Oregon‚Äôs High Desert Country, Caxton Printers, Caldwell, Idaho, 1967, p. 176. Eventually, a post office was opened at their Catlow Valley ranch. The Shirk post office was moved to their Guano Lake ranch in 1903, where it continued through 1905.McArthur, Lewis A. and Lewis L. McArthur, \\"Shirk\\", Oregon Geographic Names (Seventh Edition), Oregon Historical Society Press, Portland, Oregon, 2003, p. 871. The Catlow Valley was the scene of a number of Indian attacks during the Bannock War of 1878. Both Shirk brothers were engaged in defending their ranch. In one incident, William Shirk and two teamsters were ambushed. His two companions were killed outright and the Indians pursued Shirk for several miles before giving up the chase.Thompson, William, \\"The Great Bannock War\\", Reminiscences of a Pioneer - William Thompson, San Francisco, 1912, p. 136. The Shirk brothers eventually acquired about , controlling much of the water in the Catlow Valley. This was quite contentious since the vast P Ranch owned by cattle baron Peter French extended south into the Catlow Valley as well. As result, the Shirks had to compete with French for Catlow Valley grazing land and water. During one skirmish over a land claim in 1889, David Shirk shot and killed one of French's employees. Shirk was tried for murder and acquitted. After the trial, Shirk moved his home ranch west from the Catlow Valley to his Guano Valley property, probably to help avoid conflict with French and his employees. By 1899, Shirk had increased his Guano Valley parcel to . In 1914, Shirk sold his ranch holdings to pursue other business opportunities. Eventually, he moved to Berkeley, California, where he died in 1928.  Bureau of Land Management  Shirk sold his ranch to the Lake County Land and Livestock Company which owned the neighboring 7T Ranch. This allowed the 7T Ranch to extend its grazing eastward from its home range in the Warner Valley. In 1928, the ranch was bought by a Cedarville, California partnership, Mitchell and McDaniel. However, the property was taken by the Bank of Willows (California) in a foreclosure action that same year. For a number of years, the bank leased the property to Zetus Spaulding, who was married to David Shirk's daughter, Olive. The United States Government acquired the property in 1942, but Spaulding continued to live at the ranch until his death in 1945. Today, the property is administered by the Bureau of Land Management. The Shirk Ranch site in the Guano Valley borders an emergent marsh and meadow lands watered by Guano Creek, which drains the southeastern slope of Hart Mountain. The area provides habitat for migrating waterfowl as well as local birds and wildlife. Bureau of Land Management actively manages the cattle grazing leases in the area to preserve the wetland habitat and ensure wildlife diversity around the historic ranch complex.Ivey, Gary L., \\"Guano Creek\\" , Oregon Closed Basin, Oregon Wetland Joint Venture Joint, Venture Implementation Plans for Eastern Oregon, Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife and Ducks Unlimited, Lake Oswego, Oregon, 28 September 2000, pp.14-15. Because it is an excellent example of a pioneer cattle ranch in southeastern Oregon, the Shirk Ranch was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 4, 2009. The historic district covers . There are nineteen structures in the historic district. Fourteen are contributing elements and five are non-contributing. Today, the historic Shirk Ranch suffers from benign neglect. The ranch has never been fully inventoried to determine the significance of its assets and none of the buildings have been stabilized or restored. As a result, several of the historic buildings are in poor condition.\\"Cultural resources at Risk\\" , America‚Äôs Priceless Heritage: Cultural and Fossil Resources on Public Land‚ÄîOregon/Washington, Bureau of Land Management, United States Department of Interior, November 2003, p. 5.  Structures  The Shirk Ranch complex included seven historic buildings and five other contributing structures plus two separate contributing sites, the ranch dump area and a grave. Most of the ranch buildings were constructed during two periods. The first phase was in the early 1880s and then a second surge of building around 1910. The ranch building constructed in the 1880s included the original ranch house (today, only a stone fireplace is left standing), the oldest part of the blacksmith shop, and a small stone-clad shed which has collapsed. Around 1910, Shirk added a number of other buildings. These include the existing main house, two bunkhouses, a barn, a wood shed, a root cellar, an outhouse, a chicken coop/animal shed, a water tower, two wells, original fences, and the hand-dug irrigation system. All of these buildings are wood-frame structures covered either in horizontal weatherboard or vertical wood planking with wood-shingle roofing. All of the buildings were painted at one time. The main house was painted white. All the other buildings were painted red. David L. Shirk Ranch Historic DistrictThe historic district has fourteen contributing elements. They include the main house, two bunkhouses, a blacksmith shop, a wood shed, an outhouse, a chicken coop/animal shed, a water tower, two wells, original fences, and the hand-dug irrigation system. All of these historic elements are part of the main ranch complex which covers . There are two additional contributing elements, a dump area and a grave site, located on two small non- contiguous parcels of land west of the main ranch complex. Together the three sites comprise a historic district. * The main residence was built around 1910. It is located at the north end of the ranch compound, facing south. It is a two-story I-shaped structure, wide and long. It is a wood-frame structure with shiplap siding. It rests on a stone foundation and has a gable roof. It has six-over-six double-hung sash windows with simple molding frames. The house has a large front porch with hand-carved support posts. There are covered porches on the other three sides as well. The house was originally painted white. The interior was finished with plaster, simple trim and molding, and paneled doors. The first floor has four main rooms and two large panties. The front door opens to a central hallway and a stairs leading to the second floor. There are two large bedrooms at the front of the house, one on either side of the central hallway. The hallway leads to a large living room in the center of the house. The living room is long and wide. The living room is connected to the kitchen which has two adjoining panties. The second floor has three large rooms, two bedrooms at the front of the house and a large family room above the living room and kitchen. There is no second floor above the pantries. There have been no major structural alterations or additions made to the house. The house was used as a bunkhouse for ranch hands into the 1980s. * The first bunkhouse is a one-story building with a footprint of by . It is located west of the main house, facing south. It has a wood-frame structure with a stone foundation, plank floor, and a gable roof. It has horizontal weatherboard siding with corner boards. The doors are centered on the north and south ends of the building, each flanked by a small square window. * The second bunkhouse is a one-story building with a footprint of by . It is located west of the first bunkhouse, facing south. It is a wood-frame structure on a stone foundation with a plank floor and gable roof. It has vertical board and batten siding with corner boards. There are vertical paneled doors on south and east sides each flanked by a small square window. * The center section of the blacksmith shop was built in 1880s. The shop was expanded on both ends around 1910. It is located approximately southeast of the main house. It is a one-story structure measuring by . It is a wood-frame building on a stone foundation with board and batten siding and a gable roof. There is a shed-roof attachment that extends the structure by on the south side. The shop has large double doors on the east side and a vertical plank door on the west side. There is a small window on the south side of the building. * The wood shed was built about 1910. It is located on the western edge of the compound. It is an L-shaped structure. The building is by with a dirt floor, board and batten siding, and asymmetric gable covered with a galvanized metal roof. There are two separate doors on the east side and a third door on south side. * The chicken coop/animal shed is a one-story building measuring by . It is located north of the main house, facing south. It is a wood-frame structure made of rough sawn horizontal planking on the north side and vertical board and batten siding on the south side. It has two interior rooms, dirt floors, and a sheet metal shed roof. The door and several small windows are located on the east side. * The outhouse is wood-frame structure with a gable roof. It is now located at the northwest corner of the compound. However, it was customary to relocate outhouses periodically so its location probably changed a number of times while it was in use at the ranch. It has shiplap siding with corner boards. It has a vertical plank door on north side. * The two-story water tower was built around 1910. It is located approximately northeast of the main house. It has a square footprint. It has a low-pitch hip roof with shiplap siding with rubble stone covering the lower exterior walls. The stone walls have partially collapsed due to severe structural settlement. There are two doors on east elevation, one on the first floor and the other above it on the second floor. Inside, there is an enclosed diameter galvanized metal water tank housed on the second floor. The tank is supported by floor boards laid over log joists supported by log posts. * There are two wells on the property. The main well is located approximately east of the water tower. It is constructed of native stone and mortar with a square wooden cover. The well's water level is normally about below ground level. The second well is located south of the main house near the corral. The well is approximately in diameter. It is rock lined and has a wooden cover. This is probably the original ranch well. * There is an extensive system of juniper post corrals and board fences around the ranch complex. There are also historic split rail and willow fences along with modern steel post fences. Most of the fences have been repaired with various materials making them hard to attribute to a specific time period. * The ranch irrigation system is quite extensive and includes both historic and modern elements. The most obvious historic irrigation structure is the earthen dam north and east of the ranch complex. The dam begins as a low earth-berm just north of the ranch's perimeter fence. It gradually grows to a height of at a point east of the main ranch area. The dam is faced with hand-placed stones on the south side to re- enforce the earthen structure. The dam opens to a fenced pond south of the main ranch. A series of ditches once channeled the water throughout the meadow lands south and east of the ranch compound. * The ranch dump site is located on a separate parcel of land, approximately southwest of the main ranch complex. It contains a wide variety of used materials including domestic artifacts, fencing material, wagon parts, pieces of machinery, a tractor, and an automobile. Because these items help place the ranch operations in context over time, the dump site has historic value. * There is a grave marker approximately northwest of main house.

They include a caved-in root cellar, a collapsed barn, the remains of a rock-clad shed, and an old ranch house ruin. * The root cellar was constructed about 1910. It is located west of the main house, between the first bunkhouse and the woodshed. It is dug into ground with a footprint of approximately by . It is accessed by wooden stairway. Boards are nailed to ten below ground level posts to keep earth out of the cellar. The roof has a heavy 1og ridge pole with simple lumber planking covered with earth. By 1985, the roof had already collapsed. * The barn was probably built around 1910. Its ruins are located approximately 550 feet southwest of the main house. The barn was wide and long. By 1985, the barn was partially collapsed and had no roof left. The remaining structure included vertical plank walls fixed to large juniper posts which only remained at the north end of the building. The structure originally had mortise and tenon joints to hold up the loft. There was a large door opening at the end that was still standing. * The stone-clad shed was built in the 1880s. It is located at the southwest corner of the site, some distance from the other historic structures. It was a one-story structure, measuring by . It was constructed with common lumber sheathed with dry-stacked stones. The door on the east side was framed with rough-cut lumber and juniper posts. The shed had no windows. In 1985, the shed was in very poor condition with the exterior stone wall partially collapsed. * The ruins of the original 1881 ranch house are located approximately west of the main house. In 1985, the only remaining part of the original house was the ruin of a stone fireplace. All that remained was a number of large stones that formed the hearth and walls of the fireplace encased with dry-stacked rubble. There is only one non-historic structure on the site, an animal feed lot located at the southern end of the ranch complex. It was built in 1980 for modern ranch operations at the site. While it does not have any historic significance, the Bureau of Land Management has decided not to remove the structure since it is isolated from all of the contributing historic structures.

It was established in 1876 by Messrs Hunter and Urquhart who were living in a grass hut on the property in 1878 when they were still building up the run. One of the adjoining properties in 1887 was Elderslie Station, which at the time was owned by Sir Samuel Wilson. History In 1894 the station's shearing shed was burned down along with seven others in the district as part of a protest by shearers over wages. The Macpherson family owned the station in the 1890s and early 1900s. Samuel Hoffmeister, who was implicated in these events was later found dead at a nearby billabong. The following year Banjo Paterson visited the station and wrote the lyrics to \\"Waltzing Matilda\\", said to be inspired by these incidents. The music for the song was arranged by Christina Macpherson, the daughter of the owner of Dagworth and sister of the manager of the property Robert Macpherson. The station was bought by the North Australian Pastoral Company in 1995. In March 2015, Geoscience Australia reported that the Diamantina River‚Äôs course at and near its headwaters flows along the edge of a roughly circular crustal anomaly that might well be an impact structure. It is 130 km in diameter, and Dagworth lies in its northeast quadrant. The asteroid impact, if indeed this is the explanation for the anomaly, would have happened roughly 300 million years ago.

Most locals reminisce about the Grayson Jacobs Store that was located at the intersection of Scott Jacobs Memorial Drive and Spring Road. The proprietor was a well-known county supervisor who offered general merchandise to the surrounding community. It was a social hub for the rural farmers of the area. The store was also a polling place for elections in the county. In the 1940s until the polling place was moved, the precinct was monitored to judge the outcome of the county election results. There was a saying in the county, ‚ÄúSo goes Brutus, so goes Pittsylvania County‚Äù. Jacob's store closed in the 1970s when the proprietor died. The property lies in ruins today, with much of the old store building falling in. Across the intersection diagonally from the store is Spring Road Baptist Church. This church was established in 1852 and has been located on this site since the late 1800s. The present sanctuary structure dates to circa 1902.

The area around the store served as the county seat of Pittsylvania County until the end of 1776. Before the American Revolutionary War, Callands was also the seat of the Antrim Parish, which later became the Camden Parish, of the Virginia colony's established church, the Church of England. The parish priest lived here, and traveled to other churches of the parish in rotation, including the Old Chapel Church in Penhook, Virginia. \\"The larger building, on the other side of present-day VA 969, appears (by its exterior and interior design, and by local tradition) to be the courthouse, constructed during 1772 by Roberts after five years' procrastination, but incomplete records of Roberts' tumultuous business and public dealings make it difficult to identify the building for certain as the courthouse structure. By 1777 the court had been moved to present-day Chatham, and by 1788 the large brick building had come into the ownership of James Smith and Samuel Calland.

The Federal Court ruled in favour of GetUp! in their challenge of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918,. that rejected first- time voter, Sophie Trevitt‚Äôs electronic enrolment application after her electronic signature was deemed invalid..  The Case  In June 2010 it was estimated that more than 1.4 million Australians were not enrolled to vote. in the lead up to the Australian Federal election on 21 August 2010, political activists group GetUp developed a strategy to capture this market by providing an online enrolment facility, OzEnrol, which enabled users to enter the required details into an electronically submittable form, using a digital pen, mouse or laptop trackpad to sign their name. On 22 July 2010, the Australian Electoral Commission disallowed Sophie Trevitts's use of the OzEnrol tool to apply for enrolment in the electorate of Granydler, NSW  Arguments  The Commissioner claimed he acted under Section 102(1)(c) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (1)(c). granting him the discretion in judging whether Ms Trevitt‚Äôs enrolment application was ‚Äúin order‚Äù. The criteria for reaching such a decision are outlined in Section 98(2) in particular: :A claim: :(a) must be in the appropriate form; and :(b) must be signed by the claimant;(2). As a result, the Commissioner ruled Ms Trevitt‚Äôs application was not in order- citing a breach of Section 336 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918: :Every electoral paper which by this Act or the regulations has to be signed by any person shall be signed by that person with his or her personal signature. The Electoral Commissioner claimed that the Act implied enrolments were to be signed by hand. GetUp argued the electronic signature provided by Trevitt was legitimate in accordance with Section 8(1) of the Electronic Transactions Act 1999: :For the purposes of a law of the Commonwealth, a transaction is not invalid because it took place wholly or partly by means of one or more electronic communications.(2). The Act is applicable to transactions including those ‚Äúof a non-commercial nature‚Äù like that of the enrolment application. The Commissioner also expressed concerns over the quality of electronic signatures, noting their tendency to become pixilated in comparison to those that were hand-written. In response, GetUp highlighted the Commissioner‚Äôs frequent acceptance of enrolment forms via facsimile and scanned documents sent through email, recommending applicants do so using the lowest resolution at 100 dots per inch (DPI), thus rendering the signature quality to that comparable to one electronically produced.  Federal Court decision  Justice Perram agreed with GetUp regarding the acceptability of electronic signatures noting that it resembled one which had been faxed or emailed and thus would have been accepted by the Commissioner. The case subsequently became a technical debate over how the Commonwealth Electoral Act and Electronic Transactions Act were to be interpreted together considering the present context. Perram J disagreed with the Commissioner‚Äôs interpretation of Section 102(1) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act allowing him the discretion to form an opinion regarding the validity of Ms Trevitt‚Äôs application. He stated that such freedom was limited to determining whether the claimant was entitled to be enrolled - which she was having fulfilled the criteria of being over 18 years of age and an Australian citizen.Enrolment eligiblility - Australian Electoral Commission As a result, Perram J ruled that Ms Trevitt‚Äôs enrolment claim was ‚Äúin order‚Äù due to the fact that the Electronic Transactions Act was applicable to the meaning of Section 102(1)(b) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act and therefore a digital signature fulfilled the necessary enrolment requirement. The respondent was ordered to pay the applicants‚Äô costs and Ms Trevitt‚Äôs online claim was added to the electoral roll.  Implications  The Federal Court made its ruling in a context where the Electoral Commissioner was already accepting signatures in forms (such as facsimile, JPEG image) that were susceptible to a degree of manipulation. Perram J‚Äôs decision offers no reflection on the reliability or appropriateness of using electronic signatures; it merely discounts any form of discrimination in favour of non-electronic signature methods thus enforcing the concept of ‚Äòtechnology neutrality‚Äô as a key principle of the Electronic Transactions Act. As such, the success of this test case sets a precedent for future matters relating to the legitimate use of digital signatures as a means of identity verification - an issue likely to become more prevalent as dependence on technology continues to escalate. The outcome of the case does not however consider issues such as security and fraud detection which need to be addressed before the use of electronic signatures can be safely used in e-commerce practices. The result paves the way for a review of the electoral process and will encourage Federal and State governments to use the online medium in attempts to capture the estimated 6% of the Australian population who are not enrolled to vote. With an increased number of voters in each election, and the vast majority of them being young people (70% of those not on the electoral roll are aged between 19 and 39,) the Australian political circuit will become more competitive with policies likely to be more progressive in order to attract their votes. This case relied heavily on litigation funding from GetUp supporters and was a major success in the realm of public interest lawsuits. Further, the courts have historically played a minimal role in shaping the Australian electoral process. Getup Ltd v Electoral Commissioner (2010) was a breakthrough success as it proved the ability of the Australian community to fuel legal and political debate over issues of public interest. The court‚Äôs ruling also encourages the public to identify potential areas for change in Australian legislation and challenges the traditional assumptions of the law in a manner that reflects the 21st century and the advancements it offers.

Their musical style is best described as jazz-metal. Band History After several years of searching, classically trained guitarist Jan Zehrfeld joined several musicians together with the idea of forming a jazz metal band. Zehrfeld felt that he was always angry at something, and that this music was a way to channel his aggression.Jan Zehrfeld on his personal MySpace page In 2005, Panzerballett released their self-titled debut album and became part of the German progressive rock scene. The band went on to play a series of concerts in the Munich region, but also performed at the 15th National Youth Jazz Festival in Leipzig and the renowned Burg Herzberg Festival. A DVD was compiled from those shows and titled Live at Backstage Munich 2006. After several line-up changes in 2007, the jazz label ACT contracted the band and in February 2008 released their second album, Starke St√ºcke. A small tour of Germany began after the release of this album, and the album reached the 26th place on the German Jazz charts. In 2008, multiple concerts and cameo appearances were made, including the Zappanale, the Leverkusen Jazz Festival opening for John McLaughlin and Chick Corea, the Baltic Prog Fest and the self-organized Metal Jazz Festival in Munich. Short television appearances were also done. In August 2009, Panzerballett released their third album, Hart Genossen - from Abba to Zappa'. In September 2009, the album jumped to # 25 on the jazz charts and appeared in the drum magazine Drums and Percussion as the January 2010 \\"Record of the Month\\". The band then played multiple shows and cameo appearances throughout Germany (including as a guest of the Arte Lounge ARTE Lounge 7 - ARTE and in on3 Radio). Music Panzerballett plays both original compositions by guitarist Zehrfeld and his creative arrangements of popular songs from rock (\\"Smoke on the Water\\" by Deep Purple), to pop (\\"Ein Bisschen Frieden\\" by Nicole), to jazz (\\"Birdland\\" by Weather Report) to soundtrack (as the title theme The Simpsons). The band has noted their influences to be classic jazz and funk artists and also heavy progressive metal artists such as Meshuggah. The song Iron Maiden Voyage shows these diverse influences; the song's name is a pun on the name of the band metal band Iron Maiden and the Jazz Standard Maiden Voyage by Herbie Hancock). An important feature of the band's music is the virtuosity of their performance; the band's members have studied with award-winning musicians to master their instruments at a high technical level. One example of their technical skill are the highly complex polyrhythmic structures the band uses in their compositions. thumb Die Zeit writes about Panzerballett: \\"Ihre eigenen St√ºcke flankieren sie mit einer Reihe von Hardrock-, Jazz- und Entertainment- Gassenhauern, die sie mit der tadellosen Technik an deutschen Hochschulen ausgebildeter Musiker so vorbehaltlos zerschreddern und neu zusammensetzen, dass Wiedererkennungseffekt und Staunen sich die Waage halten\\" (roughly \\"Their own compositions are intermingled with a number of jazz, rock and entertainment standards which the musicians thoroughly deconstruct, using impeccable skills gained at german music conservatories. They then rebuild the works into new performances carefully balancing recognition with astonishment.\\")Stefan Hentz for \\"Die Zeit\\" on 13 March 2008 The band describes their own music as \\"delicate interlocking funk grooves with brutally hard, rhythmically complex riffs and jazz improvisation combined with ska-Death- Jazz\\"band's profile on www.panzerballett.de or like \\"hacking with a white-hot flail into grandma's freshly-baked ruebli-cake\\".\\"Sounds Like\\"-description on the band's MySpace page As musical influences, the band notes bands like Meshuggah, Tribal Tech, Planet X and Mats Morgan as the main source of their inspiration. Concerts Panzerballett is also known for exceptional concerts. The humor of the band, which is only implied in the band's albums (e.g. song titles such as Schmitz Kadtse und Mit wei√ügl√ºhendem Morgenstern in Omas frischgebackene R√ºblitorte or the vocal pieces with Conny Kreitmeier on songs like Zickenterror), occurs during their live performances more obviously, particularly guitarist Zehrfeld supplies, cable Rasta wig and sunglasses, dressed in a stage show, with exaggerated facial expressions and gestures, dance and exuberant H√ºpfeinlagen and headbanging. His improvised nonsense recalls announcements here and there on Helge Schneider.

Economy  Pittsville has a small general store named Woody's Country Store and a Post Office The primary industries are tied to agriculture, forest resources and real estate. There are views of Smith Mountain, Peaks of Otter and The Blue Ridge Mountains in the area. The real estate market has seen recent interest because of increased development on nearby Leesville Lake and Smith Mountain Lake.  History  Pittsville played an important role in early history of Virginia. Early mineral prospectors found iron ore in the form of Brown Hematite and magnetic ore in the 1860s and in 1878 the Franklin and Pittsylvania Railroad was chartered as a means of transporting the ore to market. The population at this time was approximately 80 persons. At the same time a 7-mile section of track was laid by the Washington City, Virginia Midland & Great Southern Railroad to connect Pittsville with Franklin Junction (Gretna). This branch was called the Pittsylvania Railroad. It connected to the Franklin and Pittsylvania Railroad which ran west from Pittsville to Rocky Mount. Around 1888, iron ore supplies were nearly exhausted and the railway was subsisting mainly for transport of lumber. The Railroad later fell into bankruptcy and was abandoned by 1932. Pittsville today is a small community. As of 2008 the ZIP code of its post office included 220 households, and several new developments on Leesville Lake such as Mountain View Shores, Leesville Landing, Parker's Landing, and Eagle Point Shores and part of the nearby community of Brights.

They were some of the most advanced pterosaurs, and possessed highly specialized cranial crests that may have served as sexual attraction, with males having a much larger crest. Classification Pteranodontia was originally named by Marsh in 1876. In 2003, it was given a phylogenetic definition by David Unwin as the common ancestor of Pteranodon and Nyctosaurus plus all its descendants. Though Marsh had originally named this group based on the shared absence of teeth in those species, most analyses show that all of the traditional \\"ornithocheiroid\\" pterosaurs are also members of this clade. Below is a cladogram showing the phylogenetic placement of this group from Andres and Myers (2013). In 2018, Longrich, Martill, and Andres revisited the classification, and made a different phylogenetic analysis. In the analysis, they followed Marsh's original classification, in which Pteranodontia is restricted to the families Pteranodontidae and Nyctosauridae. They also replaced Pteranodontia with Pteranodontoidea as the more inclusive group.Longrich, N.R., Martill, D.M., and Andres, B. (2018). Late Maastrichtian pterosaurs from North Africa and mass extinction of Pterosauria at the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary. PLoS Biology, 16(3): e2001663. Paleobiology Locomotion Similar to other pterosaurs, pteranodontian are considered to have been skilled fliers as well as adept at moving on the ground. Evidence from footprints shows that most pterosaurs did not sprawl their limbs to a large degree, as in modern reptiles, but rather held the limbs relatively erect when walking, like dinosaurs. Footprints of pteranodontians are still unknown, but it is likely that they also walked erect. Among pterosaurs, pteranodontians had unusually uneven limb proportions, with the forelimbs much larger and longer than the hind limbs. This would likely have required them to use unique modes of locomotion when on the ground compared to other pterosaurs. Most pteranodontians like Pteranodon flew like modern day albatrosses, which consists of flying very long distances and rarely flapping.Habib, M.

The company secured a charter from the South Carolina General Assembly in 1847 to build a line from Alston, South Carolina, on the Greenville and Columbia Railroad line, to Spartanburg, South Carolina. Unable to raise enough capital on its own, the line turned to the state for financial assistance in 1850. Construction began in 1853, with the goal of grading the entire stretch at once. This proved taxing on company coffers and by the fall of 1856, while some of track had been laid and the carrier began handling traffic, material for the remainder was wanting and the line was still not making money. A bond offering by the company to raise more money was hurt by the Panic of 1857 and the company was forced to petition the state to issue bonds. The state of South Carolina backed the issuance of 6 percent bonds to aid in the building of the road. The Spartanburg and Union was able to raise enough capital to complete the line by 1859. The total cost was approximately $1.25 million, of which the state contributed nearly half through stock subscriptions and bonds. Like many South Carolina railroads, the Spartanburg and Union felt the wrath of invading Union forces during the American Civil War. The line suffered significant damage when Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman's troops ravaged the state in 1865. Around 1878, it became the Spartanburg, Union and Columbia Railroad and later was incorporated into the Southern Railway.

Should the Chief Minister be unable to attend the presentation ceremony, the Deputy Chief Minister will present the medal instead.

After the cession of Sarawak to Britain in 1946, the medal was renamed as 'Long Service Badge'; however the purpose of the presentation of the badge remained the same. In 1963, after the independence of Sarawak within the formation of Malaysia, the badge was renamed as the 'Long Service Medal' or 'Pingat Perkhidmatan Lama'. Again, on 24 May 1996, the medal's name was changed again to the 'Pingat Perkhidmatan Setia', in accordance of Surat Pekeliling (Bil.Perj.19/96), dated 24 May 1996.

He introduced many artists who contributed to art in Dalmatia. Kruno's efforts answered many unsolved topics in Dalmatian art history. His interest on Baroque in Dalmatia, led him to be called Prijatelj od Baroka (Friend of the Baroque).This is an untranslatable play on words in english, since prijatelj in Croatian means friend  Early life Prijatelj was born in Split, Croatia. He grew up during the Second World War. He studied art history in Zagreb and Rome. Eventually he graduated from the University of Zagreb in 1946. The following year he received his Ph.D. in Zagreb. His thesis was on the Baroque period in Split. Between 1950 - 1979, he worked as the director in Gallery of Fine Arts in Split. These were his most fertile years. Prijatelj was the most important Croatian scholar of his generation in Dalmatian art history, particularly in the Baroque period. He wrote about the figures of Dalmatian art, and rediscoved lesser-known artists such as Matteo Ponzone. He attributed several works to , an itinerant Italian painter with scattered works between Zadar, Trogir, Split, Dubrovnik, Ston and ƒåiovo. Beginning in 1972, he taught contemporary art history at the Faculty of Philosophy in Zagreb, as adjunct professor. From 1979, he taught art history at the University of Zadar until his retirement in 1991. Since 1968, he was a regular member of Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts. He died in Split in 1998.

Two common types of expressions that a binary expression tree can represent are algebraic and boolean. These trees can represent expressions that contain both unary and binary operators. Each node of a binary tree, and hence of a binary expression tree, has zero, one, or two children. This restricted structure simplifies the processing of expression trees.  Overview  Expression tree of the expression (a+b)*c+7 The leaves of a binary expression tree are operands, such as constants or variable names, and the other nodes contain operators. These particular trees happen to be binary, because all of the operations are binary, and although this is the simplest case, it is possible for nodes to have more than two children. It is also possible for a node to have only one child, as is the case with the unary minus operator. An expression tree, T, can be evaluated by applying the operator at the root to the values obtained by recursively evaluating the left and right subtrees.  Traversal  An algebraic expression can be produced from a binary expression tree by recursively producing a parenthesized left expression, then printing out the operator at the root, and finally recursively producing a parenthesized right expression. This general strategy (left, node, right) is known as an in-order traversal. An alternate traversal strategy is to recursively print out the left subtree, the right subtree, and then the operator. This traversal strategy is generally known as post-order traversal. A third strategy is to print out the operator first and then recursively print out the left and right subtree known as pre-order traversal. These three standard depth-first traversals are representations of the three different expression formats: infix, postfix, and prefix. An infix expression is produced by the inorder traversal, a postfix expression is produced by the post-order traversal, and a prefix expression is produced by the pre-order traversal. =Infix traversal= When an infix expression is printed, an opening and closing parenthesis must be added at the beginning and ending of each expression. As every subtree represents a subexpression, an opening parenthesis is printed at its start and the closing parenthesis is printed after processing all of its children. Pseudocode: Algorithm infix (tree) /*Print the infix expression for an expression tree. Pre : tree is a pointer to an expression tree Post: the infix expression has been printed*/ if (tree not empty) if (tree token is operator) print (open parenthesis) end if infix (tree left subtree) print (tree token) infix (tree right subtree) if (tree token is operator) print (close parenthesis) end if end if end infix =Postfix traversal= The postfix expression is formed by the basic postorder traversal of any binary tree. It does not require parentheses. Pseudocode: Algorithm postfix (tree) /*Print the postfix expression for an expression tree. Pre : tree is a pointer to an expression tree Post: the postfix expression has been printed*/ if (tree not empty) postfix (tree left subtree) postfix (tree right subtree) print (tree token) end if end postfix =Prefix traversal= Pseudocode: Algorithm prefix (tree) /*Print the prefix expression for an expression tree. Pre : tree is a pointer to an expression tree Post: the prefix expression has been printed*/ if (tree not empty) print (tree token) prefix (tree left subtree) prefix (tree right subtree) end if end prefix  Construction of an expression tree  The construction of the tree takes place by reading the postfix expression one symbol at a time. If the symbol is an operand, a one-node tree is created and its pointer is pushed onto a stack. If the symbol is an operator, the pointers to two trees T1 and T2 are popped from the stack and a new tree whose root is the operator and whose left and right children point to T2 and T1 respectively is formed . A pointer to this new tree is then pushed to the Stack.Mark Allen Weiss,Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in C,2nd edition, Addison Wesley publications  Example  The input in postfix notation is: a b + c d e + Since the first two symbols are operands, one-node trees are created and pointers to them are pushed onto a stack. For convenience the stack will grow from left to right. Stack growing from left to right The next symbol is a '+'. It pops the two pointers to the trees, a new tree is formed, and a pointer to it is pushed onto the stack. Formation of a new tree Next, c, d, and e are read. A one-node tree is created for each and a pointer to the corresponding tree is pushed onto the stack. Creating a one-node tree Continuing, a '+' is read, and it merges the last two trees. Merging two trees Now, a '*' is read. The last two tree pointers are popped and a new tree is formed with a '*' as the root. Forming a new tree with a root Finally, the last symbol is read. The two trees are merged and a pointer to the final tree remains on the stack. Steps to construct an expression tree a b + c d e +  Algebraic expressions  Binary algebraic expression tree equivalent to ((5 + z) / -8) * (4 ^ 2) Algebraic expression trees represent expressions that contain numbers, variables, and unary and binary operators. Some of the common operators are √ó (multiplication), √∑ (division), + (addition), ‚àí (subtraction), ^ (exponentiation), and - (negation). The operators are contained in the internal nodes of the tree, with the numbers and variables in the leaf nodes. The nodes of binary operators have two child nodes, and the unary operators have one child node.  Boolean expressions  Binary boolean expression tree equivalent to ((true \\\\lor false) \\\\land egfalse) \\\\lor (true \\\\lor false)) Boolean expressions are represented very similarly to algebraic expressions, the only difference being the specific values and operators used. Boolean expressions use true and false as constant values, and the operators include \\\\land (AND), \\\\lor (OR), eg (NOT).

Plot summary Shuhei Horikawa (Chish≈´ Ry≈´) works as a mathematics schoolteacher in a middle school. A widower, he has a ten-year-old son named Ryohei (Haruhiko Tsuda), who studies in the same school. While taking his class out for an excursion one day, one of his pupils drowns after running off with a classmate on a secret boat trip. Shuhei blames himself for the accident, and quits his teaching job out of remorse. Shuhei enrolls his son to a junior high school in Ueda, where Ryohei studies as a boarder, and goes to work in Tokyo to finance his son's education. Years pass. The 25-year-old Ryohei (Shuji Sano) has finished college and has himself become a schoolteacher in Akita. Shuhei now works as a clerk in a Tokyo textile factory and the two meet occasionally. Ryohei has thoughts of quitting his teaching job to join his father at Tokyo, but Shuhei rebukes him for not doing what his duty decrees. Ryohei takes a ten-day vacation to join his father in Tokyo. Together with retired headmaster Makoto Hirata (Takeshi Sakamoto), Shuhei attends a get-together with his former pupils and the group reminisce about their school days. When Shuhei returns home, he suffers a stroke and is admitted to the hospital. Asking Hirata's daughter Fumiko (Mitsuko Mito) to take care of his son, he dies soon after. The final scene shows Ryohei and his new wife Fumiko returning to Akita, with the urn containing his father's ashes resting on the luggage rack; the two have agreed to live together with Hirata and Fumiko's younger brother.

Contents Time of the Dragon is an accessory for the Dragonlance campaign setting that describes the continent of Taladas on the world of Krynn. Taladas has its own unique cultures and geography, and as it plays no major role in the War of the Lance, Taladas remained relatively untouched by its events. The peoples who inhabit this continent have different views and lifestyles from those of Ansalon, including their relationship with the gods. The dragons of Taladas are also different in their outlook, and are more neutral in outlook due to the role Takhisis, the Queen of Darkness played with Taladas during the War of the Lance. The need to survive has colored the outlooks of the other races of Taladas, making the cultures of Taladas darker in mood than those of Ansalon. The 112-page \\"The Guide Book to Taladas\\" describes the physical and political geography of the continent, including the minotaur and gnome societies. After a brief history of the continent, the book discusses Taladas's geography one area at a time, and its impact on its peoples and how they had adapted. During the Cataclysm, one particularly huge meteorite struck the continent, causing volcanoes to erupt, and earthquakes shattered the land; volcanic dust fell over the continent, the seas were poisoned, and land masses shifted, leaving a vast sea of molten lava in the center of Taladas, surrounded by volcanoes. In the northwest part of Taladas are the steppe-dwelling Uigan, who draw their inspiration from the Mongols and Huns of historic Earth. The elves of this area are similar to the Uigan, being nomadic horse warriors. The goblins follow a settled lifestyle, living in small villages and hunting for food, ambushing elven and human horsemen, and making war with the elves. The Marak kender are different from the cute, cheerful ones of Ansalon, changed into a race marked by suspicion and paranoia. The Fianawar, having been driven from their underground homes by the Cataclysm, have developed a fear of the underground. The League of Minotaurs is the largest power in Taladas, and its society has built in controls to regulate the belief that might makes right. The minoi gnomes love to build devices but lack the logical minds necessary to make them work effectively, while the gnomoi gnomes are far more practical and control gnomish society, taking steps to make sure that it stays stable and develops. The 48-page \\"The Rule Book of Taladas\\" includes rules for new character races and new monsters. This booklet contains game rules specific to Taladas, and makes new player character races available, including the bakali (a race of lizardmen), goblins, minotaurs, and ogres. The book also discusses changes required to make standard character classes fit smoothly into Taladas, and provides player-character kits that summarize the various abilities, skills, proficiencies and backgrounds for 34 common character classes and races. Army organization charts and statistics are included for the Battlesystem supplement. Also included is a selection of monsters that inhabit Taladas. Two large color maps in the set detail the continent of Taladas, while a third maps the League of the Minotaurs, and a fourth map shows the large city of Kristophan. Also included are twenty-four \\"map cards,\\" each with a color illustration on one side and a description on the reverse, which map important locations and diagram new equipment. The color cards show clothing and armor styles, gnomish devices and a gnome citadel, and areas of the city of Kristophan in more detail. Publication history Time of the Dragon was written by David \\"Zeb\\" Cook, with a cover by Robin Wood and interior illustrations by Stephen Fabian, Fred Fields, and Ned Dameron, and was published by TSR in 1989 as a boxed set containing a 112-page book, a 48-page book, four large color maps, and 24 cardstock sheets. Editing was by Mike Breault and Jon Pickens, with cartography by Dave Sutherland and David \\"Diesel\\" LaForce. Reception In the February-March 1990 edition of Games International (Issue 13), Dave Hughes called the background information of Taladas \\"staggeringly comprehensive,\\" writing that the history presented was \\"not only interesting and believable, it is also exciting and different enough for you to be thinking of adventure ideas as you read [it].\\" He did have issues with the nine new monsters, calling them \\"mostly derivative\\", and spell lists and rules to be incompatible with recent TSR releases. He concluded by giving this a below-average rating of 6 our of 10, saying, \\"If you have been looking for a new direction in which to take your players, look at this.\\" Jim Bambra reviewed Time of the Dragon for Dragon magazine #161 (September 1990). Bambra concluded by saying that \\"The background of Time of the Dragon is plausible and meticulously presented, with neatly integrated cultures and races. It can easily be used as a campaign setting in its own right, as it not tightly tied to the world of Krynn. Time of the Dragon is well worth looking at and marks a departure from the standard Dragonlance saga setting. It has plenty to recommend it to gamers looking for a harsh and gritty fantasy world.\\" Lawrence Schick, in his 1991 book Heroic Worlds called the set \\"A nice package\\", and commented on the setting: \\"Taladas's strange and exotic cultures (for example, a society of civilized minotaurs) exhibit an unusual mix (for AD&D;) of magic and science.\\" References Dragonlance Dungeons & Dragons books ","title":"Time of the Dragon"},{"id":"30121532","text":"The South Australian Railways 750 class was a class of 2-8-2 steam locomotives operated by the South Australian Railways.

The thermo-galvanometer is an instrument for measuring small electric currents. It was invented by William Duddell about 1900. The following is a description of the instrument taken from a trade catalog of Cambridge Scientific Instrument Company dated 1905: > For a long time the need of an instrument capable of accurately measuring > small alternating currents has been keenly felt. The high resistance and > self-induction of the coils of instruments of the electro-magnetic type > frequently prevent their use. Electro-static instruments as at present > constructed are not altogether suitable for measuring very small currents, > unless a sufficient potential difference is available. The thermo- > galvanometer designed by Mr W. Duddell can be used for the measurement of > extremely small currents to a high degree of accuracy. It has practically no > self-induction or capacity and can therefore be used on a circuit of any > frequency (even up to 120,000~ per sec.) and currents as small as twenty > micro-amperes can be readily measured by it . It is equally correct on > continuous and alternating currents. It can therefore be accurately > standardized by continuous current and used without error on circuits of any > frequency or wave-form. The principle of the thermo-galvanometer is simple. > The instrument consists of a resistance which is heated by the current to be > measured, the heat from the resistance falling on the thermo-junction of a > Boys radio-micrometer. The rise in temperature of the lower junction of the > thermo-couple produces a current in the loop which is deflected by the > magnetic field against the torsion of the quartz fibre.

Each major installment of the game is referred to as an \\"Epic\\". The current installment is called \\"Epic 9.5: Trials of Devildom\\" (5th part of Epic IX). History The Open Beta version of Rappelz launched on 2 October 2006, with two separate servers available: \\"Tortus\\", the normal PvE server, and \\"Pantera\\", the more PvP/PK-oriented server. Those who had previously downloaded the Closed Beta version of Rappelz were not required to re-download the Rappelz client to play in Open Beta; however, extensive automatic patching was done by the client before Closed Beta players could enter Open Beta. Closed Beta ended on 26 September 2006. Closed-beta characters were deleted at the beginning of Open Beta; however, characters created during Open Beta were not deleted prior to the game's release. Open Beta ended with the official release of the game on 3 November 2006, entitled Epic 3 (the previous being Epic 1 and Epic 2: The Epic of the Absolute Creature). There are currently three servers in service namely, \\"Betrayal\\", \\"Undine\\" and \\"Unicorn\\". Previously there was four servers in service, \\"Tyrant\\", \\"Baphomet\\", \\"Undine\\" and \\"Unicorn\\" (PVE). Later \\"Baphomet\\" and \\"Tyrant\\" were merged into \\"Betrayal\\". Previously five servers were merged into two, \\"Fenrir\\" and \\"Bahamut\\" were merged into \\"Baphomet\\"; \\"Naga\\", \\"Tortus\\" and \\"Pantera\\" became \\"Undine\\"(PVE). The US test server for Epic 4 testing was called \\"Siren\\". Story The oldest race is the Gaia, and to assist them, the gods of Creation and Extinction brought two more races into the world. They were the Deva who represented the Light, and the Asura who represented the Darkness. With this, there was a period of peace and stability in the world. As the ages passed by, there was one among the Gaia who called herself \\"The Witch\\". Over time, she grew in tremendous power and with a ruthless ambition, rallied the people of Gaia to rebel against the world. Not all the people of Gaia heeded this call, however, and the world was thrown into chaos. It was only through the combined efforts of the three races of Deva, Asura, and Gaia that \\"The Witch\\" was finally captured and burnt alive. It was a victorious outcome of a unity between the three races. The three races continue to co-exist with each other in the world of Rappelz but dark rumors have surfaced about the second coming of \\"The Witch\\" and the return of her terrible forces. T Epic 6 sets you on a quest to discover who is behind the resurrection of the witch, the introduction of the previous Hero Hector, and finally the assassination of the witch. Gameplay Rappelz features three races: the light-based Deva, and two human races, Gaia and Asura. Each race has three classes: Warrior, magician, and summoner, the class whose abilities center around their pets. Pets are creatures that adventure alongside players, aiding them in battle. Pets and players level up individually, though typically a pet will stop gaining XP if it is a higher level than its owner. A Lak is magical energy from monsters and can be obtained by defeating monsters while wearing the appropriate necklace. Gathered Lak can be consumed if the player dies, preventing him from losing experience points, or can be traded at any Lak Trader for either chips or in-game currency, rupees. There were three types of chips. These chips are items that characters can use to significantly affect a battle by increasing the amount of damage the target takes for a limited amount of time. They come in different ranks which allow different levels of users to use chips. Items of equipment have their own level and can level up by means of upgrading. In addition, combinations of equipment with the appropriate enchantment cubes can further increase its potency, as is the case with weapons, and are reflected graphically through a glow effect. This is called 'enchanting' an item. A weak weapon or armour can be formed into a stronger item without having to sell it and buy a new one. This can also substantially increase both the item's in-game market value. The only non- equipment item that can be enchanted is the skill card. Items can also be improved by \\"socketing\\" Soul Stones. This is done by visiting a Soulcrafter. Soul Stones are dropped items that cannot be bought. When socketed, they will increase one of the primary stats of one's character if certain conditions are met. Soul Power can be charged at the Soulcrafter of each town and will be paid in Lak. Rappelz also features a Player versus Player (PvP) on/off mode. Classes and levels Rappelz features a variety of classes, most of which can be unlocked through attaining a certain character level and job level. Character levels are attained in the traditional way, by defeating mobs and gaining experience points. Besides experience points, defeating mobs also grants the player job points. Job points are required to obtain and level up the character's skills, but also to increase their job level. Most skills require a minimum job level to be unlocked. Geography The world of Rappelz consists of a large island, which is the mainland, and a smaller one, which is called Trainee's Island. The mainland is divided into several areas. There are also dungeons to be found, in which monsters are stronger, and experience and job point rewards are higher. Dungeon system Dungeons are isolated places reached through portals. The monsters in dungeons are stronger than normal monsters with the same level, but the experience and job point reward for killing one is also higher. There are also items that can only be obtained as a dungeon drop. Dungeons are usually entered as a party, or dungeon party. This enables the party to efficiently kill monsters and gain experience fast. Parties in Rappelz may contain up to 8 players. Dungeons are not instanced, meaning players will be able to interact with other characters and parties inside the dungeon. Rappelz has a feature in place that allows for guilds to 'own' a dungeon. Ownership of a dungeon brings certain advantages, such as a Lak and rupee 'tax' for characters using the dungeon. Guilds Rappelz features a simple guild system, where any player above level 20 can register a guild at a Guild Official (NPC) in the major towns. Guilds offer players a group to play with. Up to five guilds can also come together to form an alliance. This was implemented to avoid guild-hopping. An alliance owning a dungeon cannot add any other guild to the alliance.

Cbs.com. Retrieved on December 20, 2010. At age 21 at the time of the game, he is currently the youngest person to win the show.Who Won Survivor Nicaragua? Fabio Becomes Youngest Winner Ever. eCanadaNow. Retrieved on December 20, 2010. He was nicknamed Fabio by one of his tribemates on Survivor due to his resemblance to Italian fashion icon Fabio Lanzoni. Birza is a native of Lake St. Louis, Missouri, and graduated from Wentzville Holt High School in 2007.  Survivor  As the second youngest player on Survivor: Nicaragua, he was placed on the \\"younger\\" La Flor tribe. He became the tribe's resident goofball, sending his tribemates to endless laughter at every opportunity often by accidentally hurting himself, making jokes, or reinforcing his own stereotype as a blonde surfer. Birza's tribe mates started calling him Fabio, despite Birza's real name being Jud. Yet he kept the nickname afterwards. The one exception to his humor was NaOnka Mixon, whom Birza had a conflict with after Mixon took Birza‚Äôs spare pair of socks. This led to a tirade from Mixon during their first Tribal Council, outright stating that she hated him and his antics. Birza privately admitted that although it was his real personality, he planned to use it as a strategy, both by making himself socially popular among the castaways, while also fooling them into thinking that he was not intelligent enough to be a strategic threat, thus giving them more incentive to keep him around. Early on, Birza was an alliance outsider. He initially sided with Shannon Elkins, Alina Wilson, Kelly Bruno, and Ben \\"Benry\\" Henry. Elkins wanted Brenda Lowe eliminated because of her perceived deviousness, but due to Elkins's aggressiveness at their first Tribal Council, two of their allies (Henry and Bruno) eventually voted against Elkins. Afterwards, Birza's remaining alliance partners were in line for elimination, though he remained indispensable because of his strength in challenges. Strategically, he was perceived as somewhat clueless. The negative perception was reflected in his voting history, where his votes barely eliminated other players. After a Day 12 tribe swap, Birza, along with Lowe, Bruno, Matthew \\"Sash\\" Lenahan, and \\"Purple Kelly\\" Shinn, remained on the La Flor tribe. There, he became friends with the new members Jane Bright, Marty Piombo, and Jill Behm. At the Day 15 Double Tribal Council twist, Behm (the next intended target) won individual immunity. Lenahan and Lowe shifted their plan to a split vote between Piombo, who had a Hidden Immunity Idol, and Bruno, who was a Jury threat because of her athleticism despite her prosthetic leg. Birza nearly endangered the plan by gaining the trust of Piombo, who fabricated a story of him being a chess grandmaster. However, Birza stuck to the plan and voted out Bruno, although Piombo's story was his incentive for voting her off. Three days later, Birza and 11 others would comprise the merged Libertad tribe. Birza would then either join several (albeit failed) alliances, or cast his votes against random people, and would continue to act clueless about voting dynamics. After Wilson's elimination (where Birza won Immunity), there was an all-male rebellion led by Piombo, which was eventually thwarted after Lenahan and Chase Rice sided with the women. Though Birza was deemed socially clueless for the most part, he was kept for a longer time. However, when the remaining castaways realized that this strategy would work because he did not hurt anybody's feelings (particularly those of the Jury members), winning Immunity Challenges became Birza's last resort. He went on to win the last three consecutive Immunity Challenges, keeping himself safe from the vote, while the formed alliances turned on each other. After winning the Day 38 Immunity Challenge, Birza, along with Lenahan and Rice, made it to the Final Tribal Council. While Rice and Lenahan were lambasted for being indecisive and \\"spineless\\" respectively, Birza was seen as strategically clueless, though he rebutted that he nevertheless back-stabbed no one and winning several challenges proved him worthy of winning. In the end, it was Birza who won the five votes of Dan Lembo, Henry, Mixon, Shinn, and Piombo. Rice was the runner-up with four votes, while Lenahan received zero. Thus, Birza became the Sole Survivor and won the $1 million prize by a 5-4-0 margin, which was the closest margin of victory on Survivor since Bob Crowley's victory in Survivor: Gabon. Birza also eclipsed Survivor: The Amazon's Jenna Morasca's record of youngest person to ever win Survivor.Chan, Anna.

It is located on the campus of Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. Founded in 2001, the Forum now boasts over 800 institutional members that collectively represent 90% of U.S. students that study abroad. Members are primarily U.S. colleges and universities, program provider organizations, overseas host institutions and programs and affiliates that provide services to the field. Stated goals include establishing Standards of Good Practice, conducting research to assess outcomes of education abroad and collect useful data, promoting excellence in curriculum design and advocating for education abroad at all levels. The Forum President & CEO is Melissa Torres. History The Forum was first conceived in San Diego in May 2000 by a group of education abroad professionals who felt the field would require a stand-alone organization. By January 2001, an organizational statement and goals for the new organization were defined. A subsequent meeting a month later in Tucson resulted in the creation of a mission statement with five goal areas, the development of criteria for voting membership, and the establishment of subcommittees to produce a Communications Plan, Business Plan, Incorporation Plan, and Member Services/Tasks Plan. In July 2001, the decision was made to incorporate as the Forum on Education Abroad, and over the course of the next year, a Board of Advisors was created and the search for an Executive Director was launched. The Forum co-sponsored the University of Minnesota's Curriculum Integration Conference and agreed to partner with Frontiers: The Interdisciplinary Journal of Study Abroad, and adopt it as the official journal of the Forum. The first annual meeting of the Forum was held in May 2002 with over 150 members in attendance, who approved an Advisory Council (now called the Forum Council). In November 2004, the Forum held its first annual conference in conjunction with the Council on International Educational Exchange annual conference, in Santa Fe, New Mexico with 165 participants in attendance. In 2005 the Forum received recognition from the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission to serve as the Standards Development Organization (SDO) for the field of education abroad. The Forum's Bylaws were revised on May 25, 2006, and on July 1, 2006, the Forum moved its operations to Dickinson College in Pennsylvania. Brian Whalen, who had been serving as chair of the Forum Council, became president and CEO while continuing his duties as associate provost and executive director of global education at Dickinson College. The Forum's third annual conference, \\"Standards in a Diverse World: The Future of Education Abroad\\" was convened in Austin, Texas in March 2007. This was the Forum's first stand-alone conference, and it attracted 400 attendees. Presentations and sessions focused on the results of the Forum's Standards Pilot Project. The Forum Board of Directors formally adopted the Standards of Good Practice for Education Abroad (2007) on July 14, 2007. Also in 2007, the Quality Improvement Program (QUIP) was launched as a voluntary process for Forum member institutions to be recognized for assessing how well their programs meet the Standards of Good Practice. In 2013 the Forum membership has grown to include more than 650 member institutions composed of 75% U.S. colleges and universities; 15% provider organizations; and 10% universities located outside of the United States. Together Forum members represent over 90% of the U.S. students who study abroad. Role in Cuomo Investigation Study abroad received an unprecedented amount of legal and media attention after an August 2007 article published in The New York Times highlighted the often opaque nature of providers of study abroad form relationships with U.S. universities. The article prompted the office of New York Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo to launch an investigation, issuing subpoenas to a dozen study abroad study abroad organizations and at least 15 colleges and universities. The Code of Ethics that the forum developed as a response sought to offer colleges, overseas-study providers, and foreign host institutions a \\"compass\\" to guide their management of study abroad. The Standards As the only organization recognized as the SDO for education abroad, the Forum as an organization is responsible for determining Standards of Good Practice for the field and providing resources, services and programs to educate members, as well as the public at large. The Standards include: * The Standards of Good Practice for Education Abroad * The Standards of Good Practice for Short-term Education Abroad Program s * The Code of Ethics for Education Abroad History The Standards were created as a reaction to what was largely an unsupervised and unregulated field involving a variety of players with differing motives, backgrounds and approaches. Additionally, here was also a push to address growing risk and liability concerns given the fact that while education abroad enrollment numbers continued to climb throughout the 1990s and 2000s, many U.S. colleges and universities were struggling with limited resources. Prior to the Standards' development, existing quality control mechanisms in education abroad were few and those in place were mainly used on an ad hoc basis. Existing mechanisms included regional and disciplinary accreditation, in-country accreditation and reviews (APUNE), institutional guidelines and practices, internal or outside reviewers, student evaluations, faculty and department reviews, advisory boards, approved program lists as some institutions. The first edition of the Standards were released in 2004, and the second edition was put out the next year. In January 2006, the Forum began testing the Standards, based on the 2005 second edition, in a Pilot Project with a group of volunteer institutional participants ‚Äì domestic and overseas providers, domestic and overseas universities and colleges, community colleges and consortia. The results of this landmark Project were presented and discussed at the Forum annual Conference in Austin, Texas, Texas, March 1‚Äì3, 2007. Feedback collected during the Pilot Project resulted in a third edition, released in March 2008. In response to the increasing number of short-term education abroad programs and the Forum's membership call for guidance, the Standards Committee drafted Standards of Good Practice for Short Term Education Abroad Programs that was released in 2009. Quality Improvement Program (QUIP) for Education Abroad Institutional members are eligible to participate in the Forum's Quality Improvement Program (QUIP) as part of its strategic goal of developing and implementing standards designed to improve quality. QUIP consists of a guided self-study and peer review process, resulting in a comprehensive report and recommendations in the areas of program design, evaluation and assessment, marketing and promotion, student advising, and resources and operations. IES Abroad was the first third party provider to successfully complete this category of review and receive the QUIP 2A designation.

It originally aired on Fox in the United States on March 6, 2011. The episode follows Meg as she attempts to look after her handicapped neighbor, Joe, after his wife, Bonnie, has to leave town temporarily to visit her ailing father. Meg soon becomes infatuated with Joe, however, causing him to become nervous, and approach Meg's parents. Meanwhile, Stewie inadvertently clones a truly evil version of himself who rampages through Quahog before ultimately attempting to kill Stewie and Brian. The episode was written by Tom Devanney and directed by Brian Iles. It received mostly mixed reviews from critics for its storyline and many cultural references. According to Nielsen ratings, it was viewed in 6.32 million homes in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by Dee Bradley Baker, Colin Ford, Patrick Stewart and Jennifer Tilly, along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. It was first announced at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International. Plot While in her home, Lois is approached by Bonnie, who is looking for someone to look after Joe and their daughter, Susie, while she is out of town. Lois agrees to do so, but then gets Meg to look after them instead. The next day, Meg visits Joe and Susie, and tells them that she will be helping them out while Bonnie is gone. Joe and Meg bond on the way to school, causing Meg to develop feelings for Joe. The following morning, Meg wants to encourage Joe to like her so she makes him breakfast. Joe takes no interest in Meg, who continually tries to approach Joe throughout the rest of the day. That night, after receiving a call from Bonnie that she will be returning home, Meg travels to the airport where Bonnie is departing (Bangor International Airport), and puts one of Joe's guns into her luggage. Bonnie is arrested by airport security (inadvertently revealing that she was also smuggling cocaine), giving Meg extra time to be with Joe. Unaware that Meg has sabotaged Bonnie's travel plans, the two go to dinner, where Meg suggests that they have a baby, and then breastfeeds Susie, much to Joe's horror. Joe tells Lois and Peter of Meg's crush, expressing his concerns about her behavior as Brian went through the same thing. Lois questions Meg about her infatuation with Joe, telling her that the two have nothing in common. Meg waits for Joe to return home, when she jumps in front of his police car, attempting to cripple herself in order to have a common interest. Joe takes Meg to the hospital, where it becomes clear that she will recover and not lose the use of her legs. Meg apologizes to Joe for her strange behavior, Joe tells her he is lucky to have her as a neighbor, and the two decide to become friends. Meg also apologizes to Bonnie, who is understanding as she experienced a similar crush around Meg's age. Meanwhile, Brian tells Stewie that he has become soft, and has lost his evil nature. Realizing he is right, Stewie builds a machine to increase his evil, but it apparently has no effect. However, unbeknownst to him, it creates a truly evil clone of him instead. Later that day, Evil Stewie attacks Brian, trying to strangle him with his collar and shoves batteries up his nose, almost killing him. The real Stewie appears and rescues him, and when he sees the clone he realizes what has happened with the machine. Stewie wants to exploit this, but the evil clone beats him into submission, cuts off Brian's tail and forces it down Stewie's throat. Leaving both Brian and Stewie in agony, the clone goes outside and steals a car after graphically severing the driver in half with a machete. Attempting to capture the clone, Stewie ties Brian to a light post to act as bait. As Evil Stewie prepares to kill Brian, Stewie ambushes the clone and the two fight. Able to wriggle free, Brian grabs the clone's laser gun, but cannot tell the real Stewie from the clone. He kills the Stewie who fails to be amused by the sight of his own feet, a peculiarity of the real Stewie. As Stewie and Brian begin to walk home, Stewie turns back to the camera with a malicious grin and bright yellow cat eyes, to the sound of Vincent Price's diabolical laughter, a reference to Michael Jackson's Thriller video. Production and development Patrick Warburton announced the episode at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con. First announced at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International by recurring cast member Patrick Warburton, the episode was written by series regular Tom Devanney and directed by series regular Brian Iles during the course of the ninth production season. Series veterans Peter Shin and James Purdum, both of whom having previously served as animation directors, served as supervising directors for the episode, with Andrew Goldberg, Alex Carter, Elaine Ko, Spencer Porter and Aaron Blitzstein serving as staff writers for the episode. Composer Ron Jones, who has worked on the series since its inception, returned to compose the music for \\"The Hand That Rocks the Wheelchair\\". In addition to the regular cast, voice actor Dee Bradley Baker, actor Colin Ford, actor Patrick Stewart, and actress Jennifer Tilly guest starred in the episode. Recurring guest voice actors Alexandra Breckenridge, actor Ralph Garman and writer Danny Smith also made minor appearances. Cultural references Along with the episode's title, the Meg and Joe plot line heavily borrows from the storyline, as well as several scenes, of The Hand That Rocks the Cradle. The scene where Evil Stewie appears in the empty machine is a direct homage to the Star Trek episode \\"The Enemy Within,\\" down to the lighting and piano fill, which has a similar premise involving an evil duplicate of Captain Kirk. While driving Meg to school, Joe asks what a Lady Gaga is. Stewie shown with yellow eyes and Vincent Price's laughter is a direct reference to Michael Jackson's Thriller music video. The evil Stewie acts like \\"Chucky,\\" the main villain from the Child's Play series by David Kirschner and Don Mancini, including the way he attacked Brian, and killing people with weapons. Reception \\"The Hand That Rocks the Wheelchair\\" was broadcast on March 6, 2011, as a part of an animated television night on Fox, and was preceded by The Simpsons and Bob's Burgers, and followed by Family Guy creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane's spin-off, The Cleveland Show. It was watched by 6.23 million viewers, according to Nielsen ratings, despite airing simultaneously with Desperate Housewives on ABC, Undercover Boss on CBS and the season premiere of The Celebrity Apprentice on NBC. The episode also acquired a 3.1 rating in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, beating The Simpsons, Bob's Burgers and The Cleveland Show in addition to significantly edging out all three shows in total viewership. The episode's ratings decreased somewhat from the previous week's episode. Television critics gave mostly mixed reviews toward the episode, calling the storyline \\"a decent return to wacky adventures of Quahog.\\" In a simultaneous review of the episodes of The Simpsons and Bob's Burgers that preceded the show, and the episode of The Cleveland Show that followed it, The A.V. Clubs Rowan Kaiser wrote, \\"It was still weird and a bit experimental: An awkward conversation between Meg and Joe was done almost naturalistically, while an evil Stewie clone engaged in hyper-violence beyond the usual implied cartoon violence. It wasn't as funny as it should be, but it did have its moments.\\" Kaiser went on to criticize Meg's role in the episode, commenting, \\"The problem with Meg isn't just that she's treated as a punching bag by the show; it's that as either a normal character or as the butt of all the jokes, she's almost never funny or interesting.\\" He concluded his review by stating, \\"I'm not sure I liked it, but I did engage with it, which is an improvement over the last few weeks of the show,\\" and ultimately gave the episode a C+ rating, placing it third out of four, being beaten by The Simpsons episode \\"The Scorpion's Tale\\" and the Bob's Burgers episode \\"Sheesh! Cab, Bob?\\", and beating The Cleveland Show episode \\"The Blue, The Gray and The Brown\\". In a slightly more positive review of the episode, Jason Hughes of TV Squad praised the episode for its Meg-centric storyline, writing, \\"Meg is great as the incredibly needy, creepy, crazy, stalker type.\\" Hughes also praised actress Mila Kunis for her portrayal of Meg, noting, \\"almost expected her to turn into Annie Wilkes from Misery and strap Joe to a bed.\\" Hughes also stated his concern about the developments in the Stewie storyline writing, \\"I wonder if this was an acknowledgement that Stewie has changed with an intention to try and bring some of his edge back, or more like a swan song farewell to that level of callousness.\\" References External links 2011 American television episodes Family Guy (season 9) episodes Television episodes about cloning ","title":"The Hand That Rocks the Wheelchair"},{"id":"30121823","text":"Carl Davis (born November 16, 1973) is an American former professional boxer who competed between 2003 and 2017.
