The Capibaribe originates in the Serra do Jacarar√°, in the municipality of Po√ß√£o, and flows to the Atlantic Ocean at Recife. Etymology The word Capibaribe derives from the Tupi names Caapiuar-y-be or Capibara-ybe, meaning Capybara River. Sports Recife's sport team Clube N√°utico Capibaribe is named after the Capibaribe River. History The Capibaribe River was a significant geographic determinant factor in the history of Pernambuco State and the Northeast of Brazil. It was in the floodplains of the river that the first sugar cane mills were formed, its black clay soil being suitable for the cultivation of agricultural crops. The river also served as a starting point to reach the wilderness areas beyond. Access to the wilderness enabled the development of a livestock farming industry. Today, ongoing studies about the navigability of the river for urban transportation will assist in developing the region further.

The reads \\"All kings and nations bow before the Antichrist.\\" In Christian eschatology, the Antichrist, or anti-Christ, is a person prophesied by the Bible to oppose Christ and substitute himself in Christ's place before the Second Coming.

Etymology Antichrist is translated from the combination of two ancient Greek words (anti + Christos). In Greek, means \\"anointed one\\" and the word Christ derives from it.See Strong's Bible Dictionary:œáœÅŒπœÉœÑŒøœÇ \\"\\" means not only anti in the sense of \\"against\\" and \\"opposite of\\", but also \\"in place of\\".See Strong's Bible Dictionary: Œ±ŒΩœÑŒØ See the Lexicon to Pindar. Related terms as noted by the Catholic Encyclopedia include: antibasileus - a king who fills an interregnum; antistrategos - a propraetor; anthoupatos - a proconsul; antitheos - in Homer, one resembling a god in power and beauty (in other works it stands for a hostile god). History New Testament Whether the New Testament contains an individual Antichrist is disputed. The Greek term antikhristos originates in 1 John. The similar term pseudokhristos (\\"False Messiah\\") is also first found in the New Testament, but never used by Josephus in his accounts of various false messiahs. The concept of an antikhristos is not found in Jewish writings in the period 500 BC‚Äì50 AD. However, Bernard McGinn conjectures that the concept may have been generated by the frustration of Jews subject to often-capricious Seleucid or Roman rule, who found the nebulous Jewish idea of a Satan who is more of an opposing angel of God in the heavenly court insufficiently humanised and personalised to be a satisfactory incarnation of evil and threat. The five uses of the term \\"antichrist\\" or \\"antichrists\\" in the Johannine epistles do not clearly present a single latter-day individual Antichrist. The articles \\"the deceiver\\" or \\"the antichrist\\" are usually seen as marking out a certain category of persons, rather than an individual. Consequently, attention for an individual Antichrist figure focuses on the second chapter of 2 Thessalonians. However, the term \\"antichrist\\" is never used in this passage: Although the word \\"antichrist\\" (Greek antikhristos) is used only in the Epistles of John, the similar word \\"pseudochrist\\" (Greek pseudokhristos, meaning \\"false messiah\\") is used by Jesus in the Gospels: Early Church The only one of the late 1st/early 2nd century Apostolic Fathers to use the term is Polycarp (c. 69 ‚Äì c. 155) who warned the Philippians that everyone who preached false doctrine was an antichrist.Polycap's Letter to the Philippians, paragraph 7 His use of the term Antichrist follows that of the New Testament in not identifying a single personal Antichrist, but a class of people. Irenaeus (2nd century AD ‚Äì c. 202) wrote Against Heresies to refute the teachings of the Gnostics. In Book V of Against Heresies he addresses the figure of the Antichrist referring to him as the \\"recapitulation of apostasy and rebellion.\\" He uses \\"666\\", the Number of the Beast from Revelation 13:18, to numerologically decode several possible names. Some names that he loosely proposed were \\"Evanthos\\", \\"Lateinos\\" (\\"Latin\\" or pertaining to the Roman Empire). In his exegesis of Daniel 7:21, he stated that the ten horns of the beast will be the Roman empire divided into ten kingdoms before the Antichrist's arrival. However, his readings of the Antichrist were more in broader theological terms rather than within a historical context. The non-canonical Ascension of Isaiah presents a detailed exposition of the Antichrist as Belial and Nero. Tertullian (c. 160 ‚Äì c. 220 AD) held that the Roman Empire was the restraining force written about by Paul in 2 Thessalonians 2:7‚Äì8. The fall of the Western Roman Empire and the disintegration of the ten provinces of the Roman Empire into ten kingdoms were to make way for the Antichrist. Hippolytus of Rome (c. 170 ‚Äì c. 236) held that the Antichrist would come from the tribe of Dan and would rebuild the Jewish temple on the Temple Mount in order to reign from it. He identified the Antichrist with the Beast out of the Earth from the book of Revelation. Origen (185‚Äì254) refuted Celsus' view of the Antichrist. Origen utilized Scriptural citations from Daniel, Paul, and the Gospels. He argued: Post-Nicene Christianity Cyril of Jerusalem, in the mid-4th century, delivered his 15th Catechetical lecture about the Second Coming of Jesus Christ, in which he also lectures about the Antichrist, who will reign as the ruler of the world for three and a half years, before he is killed by Jesus Christ right at the end of his three-and-a-half-year reign, shortly after which the Second Coming of Jesus Christ will happen. Athanasius of Alexandria (c. 298‚Äì373) wrote that Arius of Alexandria is to be associated with the Antichrist, saying, \\"And ever since [the Council of Nicaea] has Arius's error been reckoned for a heresy more than ordinary, being known as Christ's foe, and harbinger of Antichrist.\\"from Athanasius' \\"Four Discourses\\" John Chrysostom (c. 347‚Äì407) warned against speculating about the Antichrist, saying, \\"Let us not therefore enquire into these things\\". He preached that by knowing Paul's description of the Antichrist in 2 Thessalonians, Christians would avoid deception.Chrysostom Homily 1 on the 2nd Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians Jerome (c. 347‚Äì420) warned that those substituting false interpretations for the actual meaning of Scripture belonged to the \\"synagogue of the Antichrist\\". \\"He that is not of Christ is of Antichrist\\", he wrote to Pope Damasus I. He believed that \\"the mystery of lawlessness\\" written about by Paul in 2 Thessalonians 2:7 was already in action when \\"every one chatters about his views.\\" To Jerome, the power restraining this mystery of lawlessness was the Roman Empire, but as it fell this restraining force was removed. He warned a noble woman of Gaul: In his Commentary on Daniel, Jerome noted, \\"Let us not follow the opinion of some commentators and suppose him to be either the Devil or some demon, but rather, one of the human race, in whom Satan will wholly take up his residence in bodily form.\\" Instead of rebuilding the Jewish Temple to reign from, Jerome thought the Antichrist sat in God's Temple inasmuch as he made \\"himself out to be like God.\\" He refuted Porphyry's idea that the \\"little horn\\" mentioned in Daniel chapter 7 was Antiochus IV Epiphanes by noting that the \\"little horn\\" is defeated by an eternal, universal ruler, right before the final judgment. Instead, he advocated that the \\"little horn\\" was the Antichrist: Circa 380, an apocalyptic pseudo-prophecy falsely attributed to the Tiburtine Sibyl describes Constantine as victorious over Gog and Magog. Later on, it predicts: Augustine of Hippo (354‚Äì430) wrote \\"it is uncertain in what temple [the Antichrist] shall sit, whether in that ruin of the temple which was built by Solomon, or in the Church.\\" Pope Gregory I wrote to the Byzantine Emperor Maurice in A.D. 597, concerning the titles of bishops, \\"I say with confidence that whoever calls or desires to call himself 'universal priest' in self-exaltation of himself is a precursor of the Antichrist.\\"quote from McGinn, Bernard, Visions of the End. Apocalyptic Traditions in the Middle Ages, New York: Columbia University, 1979. p. 64,.found in Brug's A Scriptural and Historical Survey of the Doctrine of the Antichrist By the end of the tenth century, Adso of Montier-en-Der, a Benedictine monk, compiled a biography of Antichrist based on a variety of exegetical and Sibylline sources; his account became one of the best-known descriptions of Antichrist in the Middle Ages. Pre-Reformation Western Church accusers Woodcut showing the Antichrist, 1498 Arnulf, archbishop of Reims disagreed with the policies and morals of Pope John XV. He expressed his views while presiding over the Council of Reims in A.D. 991. Arnulf accused John XV of being the Antichrist while also using the 2 Thessalonians passage about the \\"man of lawlessness\\" (or \\"lawless one\\"), saying: \\"Surely, if he is empty of charity and filled with vain knowledge and lifted up, he is Antichrist sitting in God's temple and showing himself as God.\\" This incident is history's earliest record of anyone identifying a pope with the Antichrist (see Christian Historicism). Pope Gregory VII (c. 1015 or 1029 ‚Äì 1085), struggled against, in his own words, \\"a robber of temples, a perjurer against the Holy Roman Church, notorious throughout the whole Roman world for the basest of crimes, namely, Wilbert, plunderer of the holy church of Ravenna, Antichrist, and arch-heretic.\\" Cardinal Benno, on the opposite side of the Investiture Controversy, wrote long descriptions of abuses committed by Gregory VII, including necromancy, torture of a former friend upon a bed of nails, commissioning an attempted assassination, executions without trials, unjust excommunication, doubting the Real presence of Christ in the Eucharist, and even burning it.From long quotations in Benno held that Gregory VII was \\"either a member of Antichrist, or Antichrist himself.\\" Eberhard II von Truchsees, Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg in 1241, denounced Pope Gregory IX at the Council of Regensburg as \\"that man of perdition, whom they call Antichrist, who in his extravagant boasting says, I am God, I cannot err.\\" He argued that the ten kingdoms that the Antichrist is involved with were the \\"Turks, Greeks, Egyptians, Africans, Spaniards, French, English, Germans, Sicilians, and Italians who now occupy the provinces of Rome.\\" He held that the papacy was the \\"little horn\\" of Daniel 7:8: Protestant Reformation Lucas Cranach, commissioned by Martin Luther.Luther's Last Battles: Politics And Polemics 1531-46 By Mark U.

Protestant Reformers, including John Wycliffe, Martin Luther, John Calvin, Thomas Cranmer, John Thomas, John Knox, Roger Williams, Cotton Mather, and John Wesley, as well as most Protestants of the 16th-18th centuries, felt that the Early Church had been led into the Great Apostasy by the Papacy and identified the Pope with the Antichrist. Luther declared that not just a pope from time to time was Antichrist, but the Papacy was Antichrist because they were \\"the representatives of an institution opposed to Christ\\".Roland H. Bainton, The Reformation of the Sixteenth Century (Boston, MA: Beacon Press, 1952), 43, 44. The Centuriators of Magdeburg, a group of Lutheran scholars in Magdeburg headed by Matthias Flacius, wrote the 12-volume Magdeburg Centuries to discredit the Catholic Church and lead other Christians to recognize the Pope as the Antichrist. So, rather than expecting a single Antichrist to rule the earth during a future Tribulation period, Martin Luther, John Calvin, and other Protestant Reformers saw the Antichrist as a present feature in the world of their time, fulfilled in the Papacy. Among the others who interpreted the biblical prophecy historically there were many Church Fathers; Justin Martyr wrote about the Antichrist: \\"He Whom Daniel foretells would have dominion for a time and times and an half, is even now at the door\\".Dialogue with Trypho, ch. 32, in Ante-Nic. Fath. I:210. Irenaeus wrote in Against Heresies about the coming of the Antichrist: \\"This Antichrist shall ... devastate all things ... But then, the Lord will come from Heaven on the clouds ... for the righteous\\".Against Heresies, III: 7:2, in Ante-Nic. Fath. Ib., V:30:3-4. Tertullian looking to the Antichrist wrote: \\"He is to sit in the temple of God, and boast himself as being god. In our view, he is Antichrist as taught us in both the ancient and the new prophecies; and especially by the Apostle John, who says that 'already many false-prophets are gone out into the world' as the fore-runners of Antichrist\\".Against Marcion, V:16, in Ante-Nic. Fath. III:463f. Hippolytus of Rome in his Treatise on Christ and Antichrist wrote: \\"As Daniel also says (in the words) 'I considered the Beast, and look! There were ten horns behind it ‚Äì among which shall rise another (horn), an offshoot, and shall pluck up by the roots the three (that were) before it.' And under this, was signified none other than Antichrist.\\"Treatise on Christ and Antichrist, chs. 25 to 63, in Ante-Nic. Fath. V:209-18.Fragments from Commentaries, 2:1-3, in Ante-Nic. Fath. V:178. Athanasius of Alexandria clearly hold to the historical view in his many writings; in The Deposition of Arius, he wrote: \\"I addressed the letter to Arius and his fellows, exhorting them to renounce his impiety.... There have gone forth in this diocese at this time certain lawless men ‚Äì enemies of Christ ‚Äì teaching an apostasy which one may justly suspect and designate as a forerunner of Antichrist\\".The Deposition of Arius, paras. 2 & 4, in Nic. & Post-Nic. Fath., 2nd Ser., IV:69. Jerome wrote: \\"Says the apostle [Paul in the Second Epistle to the Thessalonians], 'Unless the Roman Empire should first be desolated, and antichrist proceed, Christ will not come.'\\" He also identifies the little horn of and which \\"He shall speak as if he were God.\\" Some Franciscans had considered the Emperor Frederick II a positive Antichrist who would purify the Catholic Church from opulence, riches and clergy. Historicist interpretations of Book of Revelation usually included the identification of one or more of the following: * the Antichrist (1 and 2 John); * the Beast of Revelation 13; * the Man of Sin, or Man of Lawlessness, of 2 Thessalonians 2 (); * the \\"Little horn\\" of Daniel 7 and 8; * The Abomination of desolation of Daniel 9, 11, and 12; and * the Whore of Babylon of Revelation 17. The Protestant Reformers tended to hold the belief that the Antichrist power would be revealed so that everyone would comprehend and recognize that the Pope is the real, true Antichrist and not the vicar of Christ. Doctrinal works of literature published by the Lutherans, the Reformed Churches, the Presbyterians, the Baptists, the Anabaptists, and the Methodists contain references to the Pope as the Antichrist, including the Smalcald Articles, Article 4 (1537), the Treatise on the Power and Primacy of the Pope written by Philip Melanchthon (1537),Philip Melanchthon, Treatise on the Power and Primacy of the Pope (full text) in the Triglot translation of the Book of Concord. the Westminster Confession, Article 25.6 (1646), and the 1689 Baptist Confession of Faith, Article 26.4. In 1754, John Wesley published his Explanatory Notes Upon the New Testament, which is currently an official Doctrinal Standard of the United Methodist Church. In his notes on the Book of Revelation (chapter 13), he commented: \\"The whole succession of Popes from Gregory VII are undoubtedly Antichrists. Yet this hinders not, but that the last Pope in this succession will be more eminently the Antichrist, the Man of Sin, adding to that of his predecessors a peculiar degree of wickedness from the bottomless pit.\\"Archived copy at the Library of Congress (May 8, 2009). The identification of the Pope with the Antichrist was so ingrained in the Reformation Era, that Luther himself stated it repeatedly: and, John Calvin similarly wrote: John Knox wrote on the Pope: Thomas Cranmer on the Antichrist wrote: John Wesley, speaking of the identity given in the Bible of the Antichrist, wrote: Roger Williams wrote about the Pope: The identification of the Roman Catholic Church as the apostate power written of in the Bible as the Antichrist became evident to many as the Reformation began, including John Wycliffe, who was well known throughout Europe for his opposition to the doctrine and practices of the Catholic Church, which he believed had clearly deviated from the original teachings of the early Church and to be contrary to the Bible. Wycliffe himself tells (Sermones, III. 199) how he concluded that there was a great contrast between what the Church was and what it ought to be, and saw the necessity for reform. Along with John Hus, they had started the inclination toward ecclesiastical reforms of the Catholic Church. When the Swiss Reformer Huldrych Zwingli became the pastor of the Grossm√ºnster in Zurich (1518) he began to preach ideas on reforming the Catholic Church. Zwingli, who was a Catholic priest before he became a Reformer, often referred to the Pope as the Antichrist. He wrote: \\"I know that in it works the might and power of the Devil, that is, of the Antichrist\\".Principle Works of Zwingli, Vol. 7, p. 135. The English Reformer William Tyndale held that while the Roman Catholic realms of that age were the empire of Antichrist, any religious organization that distorted the doctrine of the Old and New Testaments also showed the work of Antichrist. In his treatise The Parable of the Wicked Mammon, he expressly rejected the established Church teaching that looked to the future for an Antichrist to rise up, and he taught that Antichrist is a present spiritual force that will be with us until the end of the age under different religious disguises from time to time.Tyndale, William, Parable of the Wicked Mammon, c. 1526, (facsimile copy of later printing, no ISBN number, Benediction Classics, 2008) at pages 4-5. Tyndale's translation of 2 Thessalonians, chapter 2, concerning the \\"Man of Lawlessness\\" reflected his understanding, but was significantly amended by later revisers,\\"Tyndale's Doctrine of Antichrist and His Translation of 2 Thessalonians 2\\", R. Davis, New Matthew Bible Project; a shorter version of this article was also published in the Tyndale Society Journal No. 36, Spring 2009, under the title Tyndale, the Church, and the Doctrine of Antichrist). including the King James Bible committee, which followed the Vulgate more closely. In 1973, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops' Committee on Ecumenical and Interreligious Affairs and the USA National Committee of the Lutheran World Federation in the official Catholic‚ÄìLutheran dialogue officially signed an agreement on Papal Primacy and the Universal Church, including this passage: In 1988 Ian Paisley, Evangelical minister and founder of the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster, made headlines in an infamous manner by accusing Pope John Paul II as the Antichrist during one of the pope's speeches before the European Parliament, which at the time Paisley was member of. His accusation, and the reactions of both Pope John Paul II and other members of the European Parliament, was recorded on video.Ian Paisley Heckles the Pope (1988) The Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod states about the Pope and the Catholic Church: Currently, many Protestant and Restorationist denominations still officially maintain that the Papacy is the Antichrist, such as the conservative Lutheran ChurchesNolting, Paul F., The Antichrist (part 1) A Brief Statement of our Doctrinal Position, 1932 and the Seventh-day Adventists...... Counter Reformation In the Counter- Reformation, the views of Preterism and Futurism were advanced by Catholic Jesuits beginning in the 16th century in response to the identification of the Papacy as Antichrist. These were rival methods of prophetic interpretation: the futurist and the preterist systems both are in conflict with the historicist method of interpretation. Historically, preterists and non- preterists have agreed that the Jesuit Luis de Alcasar (1554‚Äì1613) wrote the first systematic preterist exposition of prophecy‚ÄîVestigatio arcani sensus in Apocalypsi (published in 1614)‚Äîduring the Counter-Reformation. Christian views Roman Catholicism From the Fifth Council of the Lateran, the Catholic Church teaches that priests may not \\"preach or declare a fixed time for...the coming of antichrist...\\"PapalEncyclicals: Lateran Council V, Session 11 They are in no way to presume to preach or declare a fixed time for future evils, the coming of antichrist or the precise day of judgment; for Truth says, it is not for us to know times or seasons which the Father has fixed by his own authority. Let it be known that those who have hitherto dared to declare such things are liars, and that because of them not a little authority has been taken away from those who preach the truth . The church also teaches that it must undergo trials before the Second Coming,Catechism of the Catholic Church 769 and that the church's ultimate trial will be the mystery of iniquity.Catechism of the Catholic Church 675 In Judaism, iniquity is a sin done out of moral failing.Jewish Encyclopedia: Sin The mystery of iniquity, according to the church, will be a religious deception: Christians receiving alleged solutions to their problems at the cost of apostasy. The supreme religious deception, according to the church, will be the Antichrist's messianism: mankind glorifying himself rather than God and Jesus. The church teaches that this supreme deception is committed by people who claim to fulfill Israel's messianic hopes, such as millenarianism (British empire/European Union)and secular messianicism. =Popes= Pope Pius IX in the encyclical Quartus Supra, quoting Cyprian, said Satan disguises the Antichrist with the title of Christ.Papal Encyclicals: Quartus Supra, 2 Pope Pius X in the encyclical E Supremi said that the distinguishing mark of the Antichrist is claiming to be God and taking his place.Vatican.Va: Pius X encyclical Supremi, 5 Pope John Paul II, in his August 18, 1985 address on his apostolic journey to Africa, said 1 John 4:3 (\\"Every spirit which does not confess Jesus is not of God.

Fulton J. Sheen, a Catholic bishop, wrote in 1951: Eastern Orthodox In a Christmas 2018 interview on Russian state television, Patriarch Kirill of Moscow warned that \\"The Antichrist is the person that will be at the head of the world wide web controlling all of humanity. That means that the structure itself poses a danger. There shouldn't be a single centre, at least not in the foreseeable future, if we don't want to bring on the apocalypse.\\" He exhorted listeners not to \\"fall into slavery to what's in your hands\\"...\\"You should remain free inside and not fall under any addiction, not to alcohol, not to narcotics, not to gadgets.\\" Old Believers After Patriarch Nikon of Moscow reformed the Russian Orthodox Church during the second half of the 17th century, a large number of Old Believers held that Peter the Great, the Tsar of the Russian Empire until his death in 1725, was the Antichrist because of his treatment of the Orthodox Church, namely subordinating the church to the state, requiring clergymen to conform to the standards of all Russian civilians (shaved beards, being fluent in French), and requiring them to pay state taxes. Age of Enlightenment Bernard McGinn noted that complete denial of the Antichrist was rare until the Age of Enlightenment. Following frequent use of \\"Antichrist\\" laden rhetoric during religious controversies in the 17th century, the use of the concept declined during the 18th century due to the rule of enlightened absolutists, who as European rulers of the time wielded significant influence over official state churches. These efforts to cleanse Christianity of \\"legendary\\" or \\"folk\\" accretions effectively removed the Antichrist from discussion in mainstream Western churches. Mormonism In Mormonism, the \\"Antichrist\\" is anyone or anything that counterfeits the true gospel or plan of salvation and that openly or secretly is set up in opposition to Christ. The great antichrist is Lucifer, but he has many assistantsKorihor is directly referred to in The Book of Mormon as an anti-Christ (Alma 30:6) both as spirit beings and as mortals.\\" Latter-day Saints use the New Testament scriptures, 1 John 2:18, 22; 1 John 4:3‚Äì6; 2 John 1:7 and the Book of Mormon, Jacob 7:1‚Äì23, Alma 1:2‚Äì16, Alma 30:6‚Äì60, in their exegesis or interpretation of the Antichrist. Seventh-day Adventists Seventh-day Adventists teach that the \\"Little Horn Power\\", which (as predicted in the Book of Daniel) rose after the break-up of the Roman Empire, is the Papacy. The Western Roman Empire collapsed in the late 5th century. In 533, Justinian I, the emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire (which historians have labelled the Byzantine Empire), legally recognized the bishop (pope) of Rome as the head of all the Christian churches. Because of the Arian domination of some of the Roman Empire by barbarian tribes, the bishop of Rome could not fully exercise such authority. In 538, Belisarius, one of Justinian's generals, succeeded in withstanding a siege of the city of Rome by Arian Ostrogoth besiegers, and the bishop of Rome could begin establishing universal civil authority. So, by the military intervention of the Eastern Roman Empire, the bishop of Rome became all-powerful throughout the area of the old Roman Empire.http://adventist.org.uk/__data/assets/text_file/0011/10910/1260days.txt The Ostrogoths promptly re-captured the city of Rome eight years later in 546, and again in 550. Seventh-day Adventists understand the 1260 years as lasting AD 538 to 1798 as the (supposed) duration of the papacy's domination over Rome.The Great Controversy by Ellen White, p266. \\"Chap. 15 - The Bible and the French Revolution\\". This period is seen as starting from one of the defeats of the Ostrogoths by the general Belisarius and as ending with the successes of French general Napoleon Bonaparte, specifically, with the capture of Pope Pius VI by general Louis Alexandre Berthier in 1798. Like many Reformation-era Protestant leaders, the Adventist pioneer Ellen G. White (1827‚Äì1915) spoke of the Catholic Church as a fallen church in preparation for its nefarious eschatological role as the antagonist against God's true church; she saw the pope as the Antichrist. Protestant reformers such as Martin Luther, John Knox, William Tyndale and others held similar beliefs about the Catholic Church and the papacy when they broke away from the Catholic Church during the Reformation. Ellen White writes, Seventh-day Adventists view the length of time the apostate church's unbridled power was permitted to rule as shown in Daniel 7:25: \\"The little horn would rule a time and times and half a time\\" - or 1,260 years. They regard papal rule as supreme in Europe from 538 (when the Arian Ostrogoths retreated from Rome into temporary oblivion) until 1798 (when the French general Louis-Alexandre Berthier took Pope Pius VI captive)‚Äîa period of 1,260 years Paulien, John (2006) - \\"The 1260 Days in the Book of Revelation\\"  including the 67 years of the Avignon Captivity (1309-1376). Other Christian interpretations =Martin Wight= Devout Christian and political theorist Martin Wight, writing immediately after World War Two, favoured the revival of the Antichrist doctrine; not as a person, but as a recurrent situation featuring 'demonic concentrations of power'. =As \\"man of lawlessness\\"= The Antichrist has been equated with the \\"man of lawlessness\\" or \\"lawless one\\" of 2 Thessalonians 2:3, though commentaries on the identity of the \\"man of lawlessness\\" greatly vary. The \\"man of lawlessness\\" has been identified with Caligula, Nero,St. John Chrysostom, Homilies on II Thess., Nicene-Post Nicene Fathers and the end times Antichrist. Some scholars believe that the passage contains no genuine prediction, but represents a speculation of the apostle's own, based on contemporary ideas of the Antichrist.Net Bible: Man of sin =As \\"being in league with other figures\\"= Several American evangelical and fundamentalist theologians, including Cyrus Scofield, have identified the Antichrist as being in league with (or the same as) several figures in the Book of Revelation including the Dragon (or Serpent), the Beast, the False Prophet, and the Whore of Babylon.See footnotes in Revelation 7 and 13 in the Scofield Reference Bible, 1917 Voices in the Emerging Church, such as Rob Bell, reject the identification of the Antichrist with any one person or group. They believe a loving Christ would not view anyone as an enemy.Bell, Rob; Golden, Don Jesus Wants to Save Christians 2008. =As Satan= Bernard McGinn described multiple traditions detailing the relationship between the Antichrist and Satan. In the dualist approach, Satan will become incarnate in the Antichrist, just as God became incarnate in Jesus. However, in Orthodox Christian thought, this view was problematic because it was too similar to Christ's incarnation. Instead, the \\"indwelling\\" view became more accepted. It stipulates that the Antichrist is a human figure inhabited by Satan, since the latter's power is not to be seen as equivalent to God's. Luca Signorelli's fresco, The Sermon and Deeds of the Antichrist (see above), depicts the indwelling view. Satan whispers in the ear of this Christlike figure and his left arm is slipped through the Antichrist's garment as if he is manipulating him. Similar to the whore of Babylon's clothing (Rev. 17:4), the Antichrist's robe is purple.James L. Resseguie, Narrative Criticism of the New Testament: An Introduction (Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Academic, 2005), 217. Non-Christian views Judaism There are warnings against false prophets in the Hebrew Bible, but no personal anti-Messiah figure.G. W. Lorein (2003). The Antichrist Theme in the Intertestamental Period. p. 31. \\"Deuteronomy 13:1‚Äì6.... The functional equation of the religious aspect of the Beast, of the False Prophet and of the Antichrist in the book of Revelation is already being prepared here. There are also remarkable links with the Antichrist passage in the First Epistle of John.172 b.\\" A parodic anti-Messiah type figure known as Armilus, said to be the offspring of Satan and a virgin, appears in some non-legalistic, philosophical schools of Jewish eschatology, such as the 7th century CE Sefer Zerubbabel and 11th century CE Midrash Vayosha (also: \\"Midrash wa-Yosha\\"). He is described as \\"a monstrosity, bald-headed, with one large and one small eye, deaf in the right ear and maimed in the right arm, while the left arm is two and one-half ells long.\\" Being Gog's successor, his inevitable destruction by a \\"Messiah ben Joseph\\" (Messiah, son of Joseph (son of Jacob)), symbolizes the ultimate victory of good over evil in the Messianic Age.Jewish Encyclopedia: Armilus: This is confronted with the medieval Christian Antichrist and Islamic Dajjal, who will conquer Jerusalem and persecute the Jews. Islam Al- Masih ad-Dajjal (, literally \\"The Deceiving Messiah\\"), is an important figure in Islamic eschatology. Absent in the Quran, this figure is mentioned and described in the Hadith. Like in Christianity, the Dajjal is said to emerge out the east, the specific location varies among the sources.David Cook Studies in Muslim Apocalyptic The Darwin Press, Inc. Princeton, New Jersey pp. 99-104 He will try to imitate the miracles performed by Jesus, such as healing the sick and raising the dead, the latter done with aid of demons (Shayatin). He will deceive many people, such as weavers, magicians, half-castes and children of prostitutes, but the majority of his followers will be Jews. Eventually the Dajjal will be killed by 'Isa (Jesus), who upon seeing the Dajjal will cause him to slowly dissolve (like salt in water). Jesus will eventually kill him at the gate of Ludd. =Ahmadiyya= Prophecies concerning the emergence of the Antichrist (Al-Masƒ´·∏• ad-DajjƒÅl) are interpreted in Ahmadiyya teachings as designating a specific group of nations centred upon a false theology (or Christology) instead of an individual, with the reference to the Antichrist as an individual indicating its unity as a class or system rather than its personal individuality. As such, Ahmadis identify the Antichrist collectively with the missionary expansion and colonial dominance of European Christianity throughout the world that was propelled by the Industrial Revolution.Muhammad Ali. (1992) The Antichrist and Gog and Magog, Ohio: Ahmadiyya Anjuman-i IshƒÅ øat-i IslƒÅm Mirza Ghulam Ahmad wrote extensively on this topic, identifying the Antichrist principally with colonial missionaries who, according to him, were to be countered through argumentation rather than by physical warfare and whose power and influence was to gradually disintegrate, ultimately allowing for the recognition and worship of God along Islamic ideals to prevail throughout the world in a period similar to the period of time it took for nascent Christianity to rise through the Roman Empire. The teaching that Jesus was a mortal man who survived crucifixion and died a natural death, as propounded by Ghulam Ahmad, has been seen by some scholars in this regard as a move to neutralise Christian soteriologies of Jesus and to project the superior rationality of Islam.Francis Robinson.‚ÄòThe British Empire and the Muslim World' in Judith Brown, Wm Roger Louis (ed) The Oxford History of the British Empire: Volume IV: The Twentieth Century. Oxford University Press, 1999, p. 411. \\"At their most extreme religious strategies for dealing with the Christian presence might involve attacking Christian revelation at its heart, as did the Punjabi Muslim, Ghulam Ahmad (d. 1908), who founded the Ahmadiyya missionary sect. He claimed that he was the messiah of the Jewish and Muslim tradition; the figure known as Jesus of Nazareth had not died on the cross but survived to die in Kashmir.\\"Yohanan Friedmann. Prophecy Continuous: Aspects of Ahmadi Religious Thought and its Medieval Background Oxford University Press, 2003, p. 114. \\"He [Ghulam Ahmad] realized the centrality of the crucifixion and of the doctrine of vicarious atonement in the Christian dogma, and understood that his attack on these two was an attack on the innermost core of Christianity \\"Kambiz GhaneaBassiri. A History of Islam in America: From the New World to the New World Order Cambridge University Press, 2010, p. 208. \\"Ghulam Ahmad denied the historicity of Jesus' crucifixion and claimed that Jesus had fled to India where he died a natural death in Kashmir. In this way, he sought to neutralize Christian soteriologies of Christ and to demonstrate the superior rationality of Islam.\\" \\"Proclaiming himself as reformer of Islam, and wanting to undermine the validity of Christianity, Ahmad went for the theological jugular, the foundational teachings of the Christian faith. 'The death of Jesus Christ' explained one of Ahmad's biographers ‚Äòwas to be the death-knell of the Christian onslaught against Islam'. As Ahmad argued, the idea of Jesus dying in old age, rather than death on a cross, as taught by the gospel writers, 'invalidates the divinity of Jesus and the doctrine of Atonement'.\\" Baha'i The Antichrist is considered to subvert the religion of God from the inner reality of man as 'Abdu'l-Baha narrates: \\"Christ was a divine Center of unity and love. Whenever discord prevails instead of unity, wherever hatred and antagonism take the place of love and spiritual fellowship, Antichrist reigns instead of Christ.\\" In popular culture In February 1900, the Christian Russian philosopher and mystic Vladimir Solovyov published the apocalyptic A Short Tale of the Antichrist, showing his prophetic vision about the oncoming 20th century and the end of the human history. It is prophesied that the antichrist will be a lawyer who will present himself to the whole humanity like a pacifist, ecologist and ecumenist, \\"will convoke an ecumenical council and will seek the consensus of all the Christian confessions, granting something to each one.\\" The enthronement of the Antichrist is associated with conspiracy theories and particularly a Satanic plot to destroy the Christian faith and the Roman Catholic Church as well.

As a young unwed pregnant woman, Gonz√°lez had her plans to find and marry the father of her unborn child derailed by the United States Treasury Department when she was excluded as an alien \\"likely to become a public charge\\" upon her arrival in New York City. Gonz√°lez challenged the Government of the United States in the groundbreaking case Gonzales v. Williams (192 U.S. 1 (1904)). Officially the case was known as Isabella Gonzales, Appellant, v. William Williams, United States Commissioner of Immigration at the Port of New York No. 225, argued December 4, 7, 1903, and decided January 4, 1904. Her case was an appeal from the Circuit Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York, filed February 27, 1903, after also having her Writ of Habeas Corpus (HC. 1-187) dismissed. Her Supreme Court case is the first time that the Court confronted the citizenship status of inhabitants of territories acquired by the United States. Gonz√°lez actively pursued the cause of U.S. citizenship for all Puerto Ricans by writing letters published in The New York Times. Early years Gonz√°lez was born and raised in San Juan, Puerto Rico when the island was still a possession of the Spanish Crown. Therefore, she was a native inhabitant of Puerto Rico and a Spanish subject, though not of the Peninsula (Spain). Her parents were Severo Gonz√°lez and Antonia D√°vila. She was residing in the island on April 11, 1899, the date of the proclamation of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 which ceded the island to the United States. One of the conditions of the treaty was to transfer by cession the allegiance of the islanders to the United States. Gonz√°lez was a citizen of Puerto Rico, but not of the United States even though the island was governed by that nation.U.S. Supreme Court, Retrieved September 3, 2008 Gonz√°lez's fianc√© traveled to New York City in 1902, leaving her behind, pregnant and with another child from a previous marriage (she was a widow). He went with the intention of finding a job in a factory in Linoleumville, Staten Island, in the neighborhood where Isabel's brother Luis Gonz√°lez worked. Gonz√°lez was to join her fianc√© there and they were to marry after he found a place to live. Situation in Puerto Rico pre-1904 Under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 which was ratified on December 10, 1898, Puerto Rico was annexed by the United States after the 1898 Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Spain had lost its last colony in the Western Hemisphere. The United States established a military government which acted as both head of the army of occupation and administrator of civil affairs. Almost immediately, the United States began the \\"Americanization\\" process of Puerto Rico. The U.S. occupation brought about a total change in Puerto Rico's economy and polity and did not apply democratic principles in their colony. Puerto Rico was classified as an \\"unincorporated territory\\" which meant that the protections of the United States Constitution ‚Äî including the right of citizenship ‚Äî did not automatically apply, because the island belonged to the U.S., but was not part of the U.S. On January 15, 1899, the military government changed the name of Puerto Rico to Porto Rico (On May 17, 1932, the U.S. Congress changed the name back to \\"Puerto Rico\\") and the island's currency was changed from the Puerto Rican peso to the American dollar, integrating the island's currency into the U.S. monetary system.Puerto Rico History Retrieved September 3, 2008 The United States exerted its control over the economy of the island by prohibiting Puerto Rico from negotiating commercial treaties with other nations, from determining tariffs, and from shipping goods to the mainland on other than U.S. carriers. Opposition to U.S. citizenship for Puerto Ricans There were various factors which contributed to the opposition of giving United States citizenship to Puerto Ricans by the Government of the United States. The U.S. Congress was reluctant to fully incorporate Puerto Rico because its population was deemed racially and socially inferior to that of the mainland.\\"Changing forms of U.S. hegemony in Puerto Rico: the impact on the family and sexuality\\", Retrieved September 3, 2008 In 1899, a letter published in the New York Times described Puerto Ricans as: \\"uneducated, simple-minded and harmless people who were only interested in wine, women, music and dancing.\\"Americanizing Puerto Rico, New York Times Feb. 22, 1899 Retrieved September 3, 2008 Prior to 1898, the United States had organized new acquisitions from non-tribal governments into largely self-governing territories as a prelude to statehood and had generally extended broad constitutional protections and U.S. citizenship to free, non-tribal residents. After 1898, this process changed and in Puerto Rico, Congress established a centrally controlled administration and declined to recognize Puerto Ricans as U.S. citizens. In the Downes v. Bidwell case of 1901, the U.S. Supreme Court acknowledged that the U.S. Constitution functioned differently in Puerto Rico from the way it did on the mainland. Justice Edward Douglass White introduced the concept of unincorporated territories and reasoned that, unlike prior territories, Puerto Rico had not been incorporated by Congress or by treaty into the U.S. union. It was thus \\"foreign to the United States in a domestic sense\\", that is, foreign for domestic law purposes, yet also part of the United States under international law. The decision permitted the establishment of unequal, undemocratic polities in such territories, did not demand that those territories eventually be incorporated, and granted wide latitude to Congress and the executive in structuring those polities. Gonz√°lez travels to New York City In August 1902, Gonz√°lez boarded the S.S. Philadelphia, a small Red D Line steamship that departed from San Juan, Puerto Rico, with the Port of New York as its destination. She sent a telegram to her family about her expected arrival, which normally would be at the docks of New York. But, while the S.S. Philadelphia was en route, the United States Treasury Department's Immigration Commissioner General F. P. Sargent issued new immigration guidelines that changed Gonz√°lez's and her fellow countrymen's status to that of aliens. Gonzalez and the others arrived on August 4, 1902, and were transferred to Ellis Island. The new commissioner of immigration at Ellis Island was William Williams, a former Wall Street lawyer. He was aggressively leveling the statutory bar on those aliens \\"likely to become a public charge\\", and he was strictly enforcing immigration laws. Williams directed inspectors to treat aliens as suspect if traveling with less than ten dollars. He also instructed his inspectors to attach the label of \\"public charge\\" to unmarried mothers and their children, even though most of them had jobs waiting for them. Ellis Island policy dictated that \\"unmarried pregnant women were always detained for further investigation\\" and that single women were released only if family members came to claim them.Christina Duffy Burnett, \\"'They say I am not an American‚Ä¶': The Noncitizen National and the Law of American Empire\\", Retrieved September 3, 2008 Gonz√°lez was detained by the Immigration Commissioner at that port as an \\"alien immigrant\\", in order that she might be returned to Puerto Rico if it appeared that she was likely to become a public charge. Gonzalez had eleven dollars in cash on her person and her family was to pick her up, however the immigration officials discovered her pregnancy during her early line inspection and a Board of Special Inquiry opened a file (note: her surname was later misspelled as \\"Gonzales\\" by immigration officials) on her. Board Hearings A hearing was held the next day and Gonz√°lez's uncle, Domingo Collazo, and her brother, Luis Gonz√°lez, joined her (her fianc√© was not permitted to miss his job). During the hearings, the family focused on the question of preserving Gonz√°lez's honor and bringing her to New York. Inspectors weighed proof of legitimate family relations against presumptions that certain kinds of women were inadequate mothers and certain kinds of men were insufficient fathers and husbands. Williams said: :It will be a very easy matter to fill up this country rapidly with immigrants upon whom responsibility for the proper bringing up of their offspring sits lightly, but it cannot be claimed that this will enure to the benefit of the American people. Dormitory room in Ellis Island for detained immigrants Two days later, without help from the father of Isabel Gonz√°lez's expected child, Gonz√°lez's brother and Domingo Collazo's wife, Hermina Collazo (Hermina was Isabel's aunt, or the sister of Isabel's mother, Antonia Davila), tried to assure the court they could help Gonz√°lez. The family insisted that Gonzalez would not be a burden to the State's Welfare system since they had the economic means to support her. These attempts failed, in part because Gonz√°lez's fianc√© failed to appear at the hearing. The immigration authorities placed emphasis on his absence in its decision to stop her from entering the mainland US.\\"They say I am not an American‚Ä¶\\": The Noncitizen National and the Law of American Empire, by: CHRISTINA DUFFY BURNETT Collazo drew on his political and professional connections. In the 1890s, he had been active in the Revolutionary Committee of Puerto Rico, a radical wing of the Cuban Revolutionary Party that sought an Antillean social revolution to improve the status of workers and people of African descent. He had attended meetings with the Antillean activists Arturo Alfonso Schomburg and Rosendo Rodr√≠guez. Collazo swore a habeas corpus petition for Gonz√°lez. A friend of Gonz√°lez related the story to Orrel A. Parker, a lawyer. His partner Charles E. Le Barbier became interested in the case and filed Collazo's petition with the U.S. Circuit Court for the Southern District of New York. Seven weeks later, the court issued its opinion, ruling that the petitioner was an alien and upholding her exclusion. United States Supreme Court: Gonzales v. Williams Letter written by Isabel Gonzalez to Federico Degetau in April 1904 Cover of The San Juan News announcing the Supreme Court decision in the Isabel Gonzalez case of 1904. On August 30, 1902, Federico Degetau, an expert in international law and the first Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico to the United States House of Representatives,Federico Degetau from the Library of Congress unaware of the Gonzalez situation, wrote to the Secretary of State in protest of the new rules that made Puerto Ricans subject to immigration laws. His protest was forwarded to the Treasury Department. Degetau then contacted Le Barbier and Parker, who informed him that they planned to appeal Gonzalez's case to the Supreme Court. Once Gonz√°lez lost her administrative appeal, she switched tactics. She decided to appeal and to take her case to the United States Supreme Court, however this time instead of focusing on the \\"public charge\\" issue, she decided to take up the issue that all Puerto Ricans were citizens of the United States and as such should not be detained, treated as aliens and denied entry into the United States. Degetau saw in the case of Gonz√°lez the perfect \\"test case\\" because now it would not be about whether immigration inspectors, following guidelines suffused with concepts of race and gender, deemed Gonz√°lez and her family desirable. The case now would be about settling the status of all the native islanders who were in existence at the time the Spanish possessions were annexed by the United States. By February 16, 1903, Frederic Ren√© Coudert, Jr., an international law attorney from New York, who launched the Downes v. Bidwell case for clients protesting tariffs levied on goods shipped between Puerto Rico and the United States, joined Paul Fuller, Charles E. LeBarbier and Degetau in the Gonzalez case as a collaborator. The case, which became known as Gonz√°les v. Williams, was argued in the U.S. Supreme Court on December 4 and 7, 1903, with Chief Justice Melville Weston Fuller presiding. The case sparked administrative, legal, and media discussions about the status of Puerto Ricans. It also questioned the issues of immigration and U.S. doctrines in the treatment of U.S. citizens, chiefly women and people of color (dark- skinned). Gonz√°lez and her lawyers moved among the legal realms, aided by shared languages of race, gender, and morality, while the U.S. solicitor general Henry M. Hoyt, focused on what he considered were failed parents, rearing children outside moral, economically self-sufficient homes. Gonz√°lez, who was out on bond, secretly married her fianc√© and thus became \\"a citizen of this country through marriage\\", and acquired the right to remain stateside. She could have ended her appeal, but instead she decided to press her claim that all Puerto Ricans were U.S. citizens. On January 4, 1904, the Court determined that under the immigration laws, Gonz√°lez was not an alien, and therefore could not be denied entry into New York. The court, however declined to declare that she was a U.S. citizen. The question of the citizenship status of the inhabitants of the new island territories, and their situation remained confusing, ambiguous, and contested. Puerto Ricans came to be known as something in between: \\"noncitizen nationals\\". Aftermath Gonz√°lez had five children. She married Juan Francisco Torres on November 17, 1915, and stayed in New York until the 1930s when they moved to New Jersey (1930 Cranford Township NJ Census). She actively pursued the cause of U.S. citizenship for all Puerto Ricans because she believed that if the people of Puerto Rico were deceived out of one honorable status‚ÄîSpanish citizenship‚Äîthe United States was obliged to extend Puerto Ricans a new honorable status‚ÄîU.S. citizenship. She wrote published letters in The New York Times that the decision and surrounding events of her case revealed that the United States failed to treat Puerto Ricans honorably, breaking promises to them and marking them as inferior to \\"full-fledged American citizens\\".Resurrecting Gonzales: Sam Erman Comments by Sam Erman, Retrieved September 3, 2008 Gonz√°lez wrote the following: Federico Degetau traveled to Washington, D.C., as Puerto Rico's first \\"Resident Commissioner\\", or nonvoting representative. He dedicated himself to the struggle to gain U.S. citizenship for all Puerto Ricans. Frederic Ren√© Coudert, Jr. became a member of the State Senate from 1939 to 1946 and was elected as a Republican to the Eightieth and to the five succeeding United States Congresses (January 3, 1947 - January 3, 1959; was not a candidate for the 86th Congress).COUDERT, Frederic Ren√©, Jr., 1898-1972, Retrieved September 3, 2008 Legacy Gonz√°lez's struggle was not in vain. In 1917, the.United States Congress passed the Jones-Shafroth Act which conferred a statutory United States citizenship on all the citizens of Puerto Rico, This meant that the citizenship was not guaranteed by the Constitution. Two months later President Wilson signed a compulsory military service act which gave the United States the right to draft Puerto Ricans for military service in World War I.History: Puerto Ricans become U.S. citizens, are recruited for war effort The act, which was signed into law by President Woodrow Wilson on March 2, 1917, also revised the system of the government in Puerto Rico.Jones- Shafroth Act - The Library of Congress, Retrieved September 3, 2008 Gonz√°lez moved to Cranford Township, New Jersey around 1930 with her husband Juan Francisco Torres. Her descendants went on to live in New Jersey, Florida, California and Colorado. She died on June 11, 1971 and is buried with her husband at Holy Cross Cemetery in North Arlington, New Jersey.

K. Rowling's Harry Potter fantasy novel series. His first appearance was in the first book of the series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, as the best friend of Harry Potter and Hermione Granger. He is a member of the Weasley family, a pure blood family that resides in \\"The Burrow\\" outside Ottery St. Catchpole. Along with Harry and Hermione, he is a member of Gryffindor house. Ron is present in most of the action throughout the series. Character development According to Rowling, Ron was among the characters she created \\"the very first day.\\" Ron is inspired by Rowling's best friend Sean Harris (to whom Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is dedicated), but she has clearly stated that she \\"never set out to describe Sean in Ron, but Ron has a Sean-ish turn of phrase.\\"\\"Harry Potter and Me\\" (BBC Christmas Special, British version), BBC, 28 December 2001 Like Harris is to Rowling, Ron is \\"always there\\" when Harry needs him. Ron fits many of the stereotypes expected of the sidekick; he is often used as comic relief, is loyal to the hero, and lacks much of the talent Harry possesses, at least in terms of magical power. However, he proves his bravery several times, such as by playing 'real wizard's chess' in the first book and entering into the Forbidden Forest with Harry during the second book despite his arachnophobia. Some of Ron's qualities serve as foils to Harry's. Whereas Harry is an orphan with more gold than he needs, Ron comes from a loving but poor family. Many of his possessions are hand-me-downs. Harry is famous but would prefer to avoid the spotlight; Ron, in comparison, is often perceived as a mere lackey and sometimes becomes jealous of the recognition Harry receives. Finally, Ron is the most mediocre of his siblings, not being (as of the first book) an excellent Quidditch player, a noteworthy student, or the daughter his mother always wanted. All these factors combined cause Ron to feel insecure. Ron's inferiority complex and need to prove himself are the main thrusts of his character arc. Appearances Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Rowling first introduces Ron with his family in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. Harry is lost at King's Cross railway station, and the Weasleys guide him through the barrier at Platform 9¬æ into the wizarding world. Ron and Harry share a compartment on the Hogwarts Express, and they begin their friendship. Ron is fascinated with the famous Harry, and Harry is fascinated with the ordinary Ron. On the train, they both meet Hermione Granger as well, whom they initially dislike but who later becomes their close friend after they save each other during a dangerous encounter with a mountain troll. Ron and Harry share the same classes throughout the series and generally have similar academic successes and disappointments. Ron plays a vital part in the quest to save the Philosopher's Stone. His strategy at Wizard's Chess allows Hermione and Harry to proceed safely through a dangerous, life-sized animated chess game. During the game, Ron allows his piece to be sacrificed and is subsequently knocked unconscious. At the Leaving Feast, the last dinner of the school year, Albus Dumbledore, Hogwarts's Headmaster, awards Ron fifty House points to Gryffindor for \\"the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years.\\" These last-minute points help support Gryffindor's securing of the House Cup. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets The second installment, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, takes place the year following the events of the Philosopher's Stone. During the summer, Ron attempts to write to Harry several times. He receives no reply because Dobby the house elf is stopping Harry's wizard mail. Ron becomes so concerned that he and his brothers Fred and George fly their father's enchanted Ford Anglia car to Harry's home at his aunt and uncle's house. Harry spends the next month at the Weasleys' home, The Burrow. While attempting to depart from King's Cross station, Harry and Ron find themselves unable to enter the barrier to access Platform 9¬æ. With Harry, Ron conceives the idea of taking the flying Ford Anglia to Hogwarts. The plan is successful, but the Anglia loses power at the end of the journey and crashes into the Whomping Willow. Ron and Harry survive the impact, but Ron's wand is broken in the process, and the car drives itself off into the Forbidden Forest, a forest at the edge of the Hogwarts grounds in which student access is prohibited. Ron receives a Howler from his mother, berating him for taking the car. Later in the novel, Ron and Harry transform themselves using Polyjuice Potion to resemble Draco Malfoy's close associates Crabbe and Goyle, so that they can spy on him, and find out what he knows about the Chamber of Secrets. During the hunt to find the Heir of Slytherin, Ron is responsible for providing the first clue to the identity of Tom Marvolo Riddle, recalling that he saw the name \\"T. M. Riddle\\" on a trophy inscribed \\"For Special Services to the School\\". Later Ron is forced to come face-to-face with his worst nightmare, spiders, in the Forbidden Forest, where the two have ventured at Hagrid's suggestion. Giant spiders nearly devour the two of them, but the Weasley Ford Anglia returns from the Forbidden Forest and rescues the pair. Ron and Harry then discover the entrance into the Chamber, and enter it in the hopes of saving Ginny Weasley, Ron's sister, who had been kidnapped and kept in the Chamber. Due to an accident with Ron's wand, the Chamber Entrance's ceiling collapses, trapping Ron on one side and Harry on the other. Harry goes on to rescue Ginny and save the day. Ron and Harry are given Special Awards for Services to the School for this, and he receives two hundred points, along with Harry for their success in the Chamber of Secrets. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban In Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Ron's rat, Scabbers, already seen in Philosopher's Stone, goes missing, which he blames Hermione's new cat Crookshanks, and the two have a falling-out. They eventually make up when Hermione has a nervous breakdown brought by taking too many classes and distress at the fate of the hippogriff Buckbeak. The animal, owned by Hagrid, has been put on trial for injuring Draco and risks execution. Ron offers to help with the preparation of Buckbeak's defence, but this fails to help. Harry, Ron and Hermione go to see Hagrid on the execution day where they discover Scabbers hiding out in Hagrid's hut. As they leave, Scabbers struggles free of Ron and runs away. He chases Scabbers to the Whomping Willow where he is grabbed by a large black dog and dragged into a tunnel hidden below the tree. Harry and Hermione follow the tunnel, which leads to the Shrieking Shack. The dog is actually the animal form of Sirius Black (an Animagus), Harry's godfather and an escaped convict from the wizard prison Azkaban. The school's Defence Against the Dark Arts professor Remus Lupin arrives just after Harry and Hermione. Along with Sirius, Lupin casts a spell on Scabbers, who also turns out to be an Animagus by the name of Peter Pettigrew. Pettigrew was Sirius's, Lupin's, and Harry's father James Potter's school friend, thought to have been murdered by Sirius. Pettigrew, who had lived as a rat ever since faking his death, denies everything, but Sirius and Lupin piece together that he has been a servant of Voldemort, and it was he who divulged the secret whereabouts of Harry's parents, leading to their murder. Initially, Ron does not believe Sirius and refuses to turn over Scabbers to him, but he is disgusted when he learns his rat's identity. Pettigrew escapes when the main characters lead him out of the Whomping Willow. Ron, knocked out by a spell from Pettigrew, is taken to the hospital wing, and is forced to remain there while Harry and Hermione travel back in time to save Sirius and Buckbeak. At the end of the novel, Sirius sends Ron an excitable little owl whom Ginny names Pigwidgeon, but whom Ron refers to as \\"Pig\\". Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, the Weasleys invite Harry and Hermione to the Quidditch World Cup. Ron is in awe of his favourite Quidditch champion, Viktor Krum. Ron is even more excited when Krum, still a student at the Durmstrang wizarding school, comes to Hogwarts to take part in the Triwizard Tournament, a magical wizarding tournament opposing the top three magic schools in Europe. However, when Harry, underage, mysteriously becomes the fourth Tournament champion, Ron joins the dissenters who think Harry somehow cheated his way into the tournament and feels let down; according to Hermione, this stems from Ron's latent envy caused by being left out of the spotlight shared by Harry or his brothers. The rift is serious enough that the friends fail to make up for nearly a month. They only reconcile shortly after Harry successfully gets by a fire-breathing dragon in the first task; Ron realises how dangerous the Tournament is and finally believes that Harry did not enter himself. At Christmas time, as per Triwizard Tournament tradition, Hogwarts hosts a Yule Ball. Ron and Harry panic at the prospect of having to secure dates for the event, and Ron appalls Hermione with his immature approach, particularly for failing to extend her an invitation, apparently failing until the last minute to even realise she is a girl. At the last minute, Harry saves the day by getting Parvati Patil and her sister Padma to agree to come with the duo, although Padma seems less than pleased at Ron's surly attitude and shabby dress. Ron becomes overcome with jealousy when he sees Hermione with her date: his former idol Krum. When Hermione comes over to Ron and Harry for a friendly chat, Ron loses control and accuses her of \\"fraternising with the enemy\\" and giving away Harry's Triwizard secrets. At the evening's end, the two have a heated row, in which Hermione tells Ron he should have asked her before Krum, rather than simply hoping to secure her by default. Ron completely fails to get the hint and remains either in denial or oblivious to the pair's increasingly obvious feelings for each other. Ron's jealousy over Krum is mirrored by Hermione's dislike of Fleur Delacour (of the Beauxbatons Academy and a Triwizard competitor), on whom Ron has an obvious crush. In the Second Task of the Tournament, Ron is the person selected for Harry to rescue from the depths of the Hogwarts Lake, as he is the one whom Harry would most miss. Harry successfully saves him and Ron mocks him gently for thinking that the hostages for the task were in actual danger. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix In Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Ron is appointed a Gryffindor prefect, much to the surprise of himself and everyone else, especially Hermione, the other new prefect. His brother, Percy, now distant and disconnected from the family, sends Ron an owl congratulating him and advising him to \\"sever ties\\" with Harry and side himself instead with Professor Umbridge, the abominable new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts; the letter angers Ron. Ron explicitly shows his support and loyalty for Harry when his classmates imply Harry is lying about the return of Voldemort, sometimes using his power as prefect to threaten them into silence. Though they spend their usual amount of time bickering, Ron and Hermione present a united front endorsing Harry. Ron supports Hermione's suggestion of Harry teaching students practical Defence Against the Dark Arts, which Umbridge, using the Ministry of Magic to slowly take over the Dumbledore-run school, has all but banned. He co-founds the secret students' group called Dumbledore's Army. He also joins the Gryffindor Quidditch team as Keeper, but his nerves and confidence issues often get the better of him during practices and matches, causing the Slytherins to make up a song about how Ron will make sure Slytherin win the interhouse Quidditch Cup. However, during the last match, Ron plays better and wins the game and the Quidditch Cup for Gryffindor. At the climax of the novel, Ron battles the Death Eaters alongside Harry, Hermione, Ginny, Neville Longbottom and Luna Lovegood at the Department of Mysteries. He is injured in the fight, but makes a full recovery by the end of the novel. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Ron, who has grown taller over the summer, attracts the attention of Lavender Brown. Harry, the new Quidditch Captain, picks Ron to continue as Keeper for the Gryffindor Quidditch team, over competing candidate Cormac McLaggen who is equally-skilled but has difficulty with teamwork and following orders. Upon learning Hermione most likely had kissed Krum, Ron performs increasingly badly at Quidditch, and thrown off by jealousy of his former idol, becomes unkind to Hermione. His low self-esteem is not helped much by his younger sister Ginny who after Ron reacts badly to finding her kissing her boyfriend, throws in the fact that of those in the group, Ron is the only one who has never had his first kiss. To bolster Ron's confidence, Harry pretends to give him Felix Felicis, a potion which makes the drinker lucky; believing he has actually taken it, Ron performs admirably and Gryffindor wins the match. However, this leads to a major row between Ron and Hermione: Hermione accuses Harry of helping Ron cheat, while Ron berates Hermione for having no faith in his abilities. At a post-game celebration, Ron kisses Lavender (though Ginny describes it as \\"eating her face\\"). Hermione, jealous and seeking retaliation, takes McLaggen as her date to new Potions professor Horace Slughorn's Christmas party, but he proves to be an egomaniac. After Christmas, Hermione continues to ignore Ron, stopping only to give him disdainful looks and occasional snide remarks. By now, Ron is visibly discontent with his relationship with Lavender. On his birthday in March, Ron accidentally eats Amortentia-infused Chocolate Cauldrons (actually meant for Harry). After being cured by Slughorn, he then consumes poisoned mead (which Draco Malfoy actually intended for Dumbledore). Harry saves his life by forcing a bezoar, a poison antidote, into his mouth, and Ron is transferred to the hospital wing. A panic-stricken Hermione arrives, forgetting her past anger. While sitting by his bed, Hermione, Harry, Ginny and the twins hear Ron mutter Hermione's name in his delirium, although they do not hear what he is saying and ignore it. Conversely, Ron feigns sleep when Lavender visits him. Upon recovering, Ron and Hermione reconcile, and a little while later, Ron and Lavender break up. Rowling in an interview said that she \\"really enjoyed writing the Ron/Lavender business, and the reason that was enjoyable was Ron up to this point has been quite immature compared to the other two, and he kind of needed to make himself worthy of Hermione....he had to grow up emotionally and now he's taken a big step up.\\" Initially, Ron does not support Harry's belief that Draco Malfoy is a Death Eater, a follower of Voldemort, but is later convinced. Before leaving Hogwarts with Dumbledore to recover a Horcrux Harry arranges for Ron, Hermione, and Ginny‚Äîtogether with any of Dumbledore's Army they can summon‚Äîto keep a close watch on Malfoy and Snape. Harry also provides them with the remains of his vial of Felix Felicis, to aid them in the effort. Despite the D.A.'s watch, Malfoy provides the Death Eaters entrance into Hogwarts, and a battle ensues. Thanks to Felix Felicis, Ron, Hermione and Ginny are unharmed by the Death Eater's hexes during the battle. Snape kills Dumbledore during the battle when Malfoy proves that he is unable to. During his funeral, Ron comforts a weeping Hermione. Ron and Hermione vow to help Harry find and destroy the Horcruxes and kill Voldemort, even if it means leaving Hogwarts. Attention is drawn several times to Ron's deepening relationships to Harry and Hermione, with unresolved romantic tension with Hermione being one of the main subplots of the novel (and indeed, the entire series). Furthermore, Harry and Ron's friendship has strengthened to the point where Harry can tell Ron that his Quidditch performance is endangering his membership on the team without either character taking it personally. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Ron agrees to go with Harry and Hermione on the quest to destroy all of Voldemort's Horcruxes. Worried that the Ministry, now taken over by Voldemort, will learn he is with Harry on a quest, Ron dresses the family ghoul up in pyjamas and spreads the story he is ill with \\"spattergroit\\", a type of highly contagious magical illness. Ron disguises himself as Reginald Cattermole as the trio attempts to find the locket Horcrux in the possession of Dolores Umbridge. Harry decides he wants someone to wear the Horcrux at all times, fearing it might be lost or stolen. This has a much more profound effect on Ron than it seems to have on Hermione or Harry. Ron ends up lashing out in frustration at the lack of comforts and a concrete plan, eventually leaving his friends behind. Distressed over his absence, Harry and Hermione do not even mention his name during the time that he is gone. However, when they finally mention his name, Ron, who had immediately regretted his decision to leave but was captured by Snatchers and then could not return due to Hermione's anti-Death Eater enchantments, was led to Harry's location by unknown magic within the Deluminator he inherited from Dumbledore. Ron dramatically returns by saving Harry from drowning when Harry is attempting to recover Godric Gryffindor's sword from an icy pool. Harry, a sudden believer in the fate created by his return, immediately forgives Ron and insists it must be Ron who uses the sword to destroy Slytherin's locket. However, the portion of Voldemort's soul inside it plays on Ron's insecurities by revealing that Ron thinks he is \\"least loved by a mother who craved a daughter\\", then showing him a doppelg√§nger of Harry who tells him that Harry was happier without him and a doppelg√§nger of Hermione who does not return his affections and is involved instead with Harry. Ron summons his courage and overcomes the spell, destroying the locket, but is visibly shaken until Harry tells him that he regards Hermione as a sister and a friend, nothing more. The trio are eventually captured by Snatchers, and Bellatrix Lestrange tortures Hermione with the Cruciatus Curse for information. This sends Ron into a panic, and he continually screams and fights with all his effort to save her, despite Harry's instruction that he calm down and think of a better plan. The trio and some other prisoners are rescued by Dobby, but the house-elf is killed by Bellatrix during the escape. Eventually, the trio returns to Hogwarts, hoping to find the last unknown Horcrux shown in Harry's vision. Having lost the Sword of Gryffindor to Griphook the goblin, Ron gets an idea to procure more Basilisk fangs and manages to speak enough Parseltongue to open the Chamber of Secrets, where Hermione destroys the Horcrux in Helga Hufflepuff's cup. He begins to worry about the fate of Hogwarts' elves. Upon hearing this, Hermione drops the basilisk fangs she was carrying and kisses him for the first time. He also takes part in the Battle of Hogwarts, witnessing the death of his brother Fred, and teams up with Neville to defeat Fenrir Greyback. =Epilogue= Nineteen years after Voldemort's downfall, Ron and Hermione have two children: Rose Granger-Weasley, whom they are sending off to her first year at Hogwarts, and a younger son named Hugo. Though the epilogue does not explicitly say Ron and Hermione are married, news articles and other sources treat it as a fact. Ron has also passed his Muggle driving test, despite Hermione's apparent belief that he could not do so without Confunding the examiner. (Ron secretly reveals to Harry he actually did Confund the examiner.) He and Harry work for the Ministry of Magic as Aurors, and along with Hermione they have helped to revamp the Ministry; it is far different from the one that existed previously.\\"JK Rowling's Interview with Meredith Vieira\\", 26 July 2007 'Todayshow.com' Retrieved on 26 July 2007 Before becoming an Auror, Ron joins George at Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, which becomes a very lucrative business. Characterisation Outward appearance Rowling introduces Ron as \\"tall, thin and gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose.\\" Ron has the trademark red hair of the Weasleys and is indeed one of Harry's tallest schoolmates, even outgrowing some of his older brothers. Rowling states in the novels that Ron has freckles, though Rupert Grint, the actor who plays Ron, has none. Rowling has also stated that Ron has blue eyes. Personality Rowling in an interview described Ron as very funny but insensitive and immature, saying \\"There's a lot of immaturity about Ron, and that's where a lot of the humor comes from.\\" As his first exercise with the actors who portray the central trio, Alfonso Cuar√≥n, who directed the third film in the series, Prisoner of Azkaban, assigned them to write an autobiographical essay about their character, written in the first person, spanning birth to the discovery of the magical world, and including the character's emotional experience. Of Rupert Grint's essay, Cuar√≥n recalls, \\"Rupert didn't deliver the essay. When I questioned why he didn't do it, he said, 'I'm Ron; Ron wouldn't do it.' So I said, 'Okay, you do understand your character.'\\"McCabe, Bob. Harry Potter Page to Screen: The Complete Filmmaking Journey. 2011. Harper Design. Page 102. Commenting on Ron's character development in the final book, Rowling explained that \\"Ron is the most immature of the three main characters, but in part seven he grows up. He was never strong footed, people see him mostly as Harry's friend; his mother had actually wanted a girl and in the last book he finally has to acknowledge his weaknesses. But it's exactly that which makes Ron a man.\\" Magical abilities and skills Ron is given his brother Charlie's old, chipped wand, which is made out of ash and has a unicorn hair sticking out of the end. He holds the wand together with Spellotape after nearly breaking it in half at the start of Chamber of Secrets, but it malfunctions dreadfully after this, backfiring spells, making strange noises, and emitting objects from the wrong end. Ron's new wand is fourteen inches, willow and unicorn hair, which he procures before the start of his third year at Hogwarts. Ron's talents are rarely shown, but he, like the other DA members, survives a violent encounter with adult Death Eaters in Order of the Phoenix, and it is implied that during the Death Eater assault in Half-Blood Prince he held his own quite well because he was being helped by Felix Felicis, the good luck potion. In Deathly Hallows, Ron loses his original wand, and takes Peter Pettigrew's wand for his own. Following this, Ron begins to demonstrate more aptitude and general knowledge, along with a sudden spurt in maturity after a terrible row with Harry. For a while, he effectively leads the trio in the hunt for the Horcruxes while Harry suffers a major depression. Rowling has stated that Ron's Patronus Charm takes the form of a Jack Russell Terrier, \\"a really sentimental choice\\" as Rowling herself owns a Jack Russell.Anelli, Melissa and Emerson Spartz. \\"The Leaky Cauldron and Mugglenet interview Joanne Kathleen Rowling: Part Three,\\" The Leaky Cauldron, 16 July 2005 Family tree Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, for left to right: Fred or George, Ron, Charlie, Molly, Arthur, Ginny, Bill, Percy, and George or Fred. Ron was born into the Weasley family on 1 March 1980, the sixth of their seven children, and the youngest son. His middle name, Bilius, is the same as that of a deceased uncle. Ron grew up in the family home, The Burrow, near the village of Ottery St Catchpole in Devon. Ron has six siblings: his five older brothers, Bill, Charlie, Percy, twins Fred and George, and a younger sister, Ginny, each with their own distinct personality trait. One recurring factor in Ron's siblings is that they often appear to be more confident, self-assured and, to varying degrees, more outwardly talented than he is. The Weasley family is one of the few remaining pure-blood wizarding families, though they were considered \\"blood traitors\\" for associating with non-pure-bloods. Moreover, they are far from rich, and are looked down upon by snobbish \\"old families\\" such as the Malfoys. All of the Weasleys have been sorted into Gryffindor House at Hogwarts. All of the Weasley children, except Bill and Percy who both were Head Boy, are known to have played on the Gryffindor Quidditch team, with Charlie being the captain of the team for at least one of his school years. Bill, Charlie, and Ron were also chosen as the prefect of their House. The Weasleys also all work for the Order of the Phoenix, and all are members except for Ron, Percy, and Ginny, who (as of the end of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows) are not known to have officially been inducted into the Order. Arthur is distantly related to Sirius Black and is part of the famed Black family, though he and the rest of his immediate family have been considered \\"blood traitors\\" and are disowned. Other distant relatives include Draco Malfoy, Nymphadora Tonks, and Bellatrix Lestrange. Reception Ron was chosen by IGN as their third favourite Harry Potter character, who said that Ron's status as comic relief made him \\"instantly endearing\\" and that his frustration and flirtation with Hermione Granger was a \\"highlight\\". In popular culture Ron has made several appearances in parodies of Harry Potter. Seth Meyers appeared as Ron in Saturday Night Live in the sketch in which Lindsay Lohan portrays Hermione. On his The Big Impression show, Alistair McGowan did a sketch called \\"Louis Potter and the Philosopher's Scone\\". It featured impressions of Anne Robinson as Ron. In 2003, Comic Relief performed a spoof story called Harry Potter and the Secret Chamberpot of Azerbaijan, in which Jennifer Saunders appeared as both Ron and J. K. Rowling. In Harry Podder: Dude Where's My Wand?, a play by Desert Star Theater in Utah, written by sisters Laura J., Amy K. and Anna M. Lewis, Ron appears as \\"Ron Sneasley\\". In the Harry Bladder sketches in All That, Ron appears as ReRon and is played by Bryan Hearne. Ron also is a regular character in Potter Puppet Pals sketches by Neil Cicierega. In one of the episodes, \\"The Mysterious Ticking Noise\\", Ron, along with Snape, Harry, Hermione and Dumbledore, is killed by a bomb placed by Voldemort; the episode being the seventeenth most viewed video of all time as of 2008 and the winner for \\"Best Comedy\\" of the year 2007 at YouTube. In the 2008 American comedy film Yes Man, Carl (portrayed by Jim Carrey) attends a Harry Potter-themed party hosted by Norman (Rhys Darby), in which Norman disguises as Ron. In A Very Potter Musical (2009) and A Very Potter Sequel (2010), parody musicals by StarKid Productions, Ron was portrayed by Joey Richter.

In the morning Zolt√°n Tildy together with Istv√°n Szab√≥ and Istv√°n Bib√≥ held a meeting in the parliament, but when the Soviet troops reached and surrounded the building Zolt√°n Tildy went to negotiate with them and reached an agreement: the Soviets could occupy the building after all civilians left safely and Zolt√°n Tildy would leave as well. The proclamation's author, Istv√°n Bib√≥, was the only cabinet minister who remained at his post in the parliament building and thus considered himself the only representative of the Hungarian government at the time. The proclamation The proclamation claimed that the Hungarian government did not seek to pursue an anti-Soviet policy, and denounced accusations that the revolution was orchestrated by fascists. It proposed that the Hungarian government would have been able to limit mob rule and said that the intervention of a foreign army was the major cause of tensions. Istv√°n Bib√≥ called the Hungarians to not recognise the Soviet military or the Soviet puppet government as legal authority, and to resist them with passive civil disobedience, but not a civil war. The author had been in the government for only one day and claimed that the reason he did not call for armed resistance was that he was not aware of the military situation. The author called the world great powers and the United Nations to protect the freedom of the Hungarian nation in accordance with the United Nations Charter. The proclamation declared Minister of State Anna K√©thly to be the only authorised representative of the Hungarian government abroad.

It was released for Microsoft Windows and OS X in May 2012, the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in September 2013, the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in August 2014, and the Nintendo Switch in November 2018. Players choose to play as one of seven character classes ‚Äì Barbarian, Crusader, Demon Hunter, Monk, Necromancer, Witch Doctor, or Wizard ‚Äì and are tasked with defeating the Lord of Terror, Diablo, as in previous games in the series. An expansion pack entitled Reaper of Souls was released for PC in March 2014. It was released for consoles as part of the Diablo III: Ultimate Evil Edition version in August 2014. The Rise of the Necromancer pack was released for the Windows, macOS, and PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in June 2017. Diablo III: Eternal Collection, combining Reaper of Souls and Rise of the Necromancer, was released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in June 2017, and for the Nintendo Switch in November 2018. The game received critical acclaim, although its always-on DRM feature was criticized. The game set a new record for \\"fastest- selling PC game\\" by selling over 3.5 million copies in the first 24 hours of its release, and became the best-selling PC game of 2012 by selling over 12 million copies. As of August 2015, the number of sales had grown to over 30 million. A sequel, Diablo IV, was announced in 2019 and is currently in development. Gameplay Diablo IIIs inventory and HUD retain a feel similar to that found in earlier games in the series, including a viewpoint reminiscent of the isometric view of Diablo IIIs predecessors. The inventory has sixty slots for items. Armor and weaponry each occupy two slots and all other items each occupy one slot. It can also be expanded to include details about the character's attributes. Much like in Diablo and Diablo II, the quality and attributes of equipment are randomized. In addition to base stats (such as damage and attack speed for weapon or armor points on armor) higher- quality items have additional properties such as extra damage, attribute bonuses, bonuses to critical hit chance, or sockets, which allow items to be upgraded and customized by adding gems for various stat bonuses. Magic-quality items have up to three random properties, rare-quality items have up to six, and legendary-quality items typically have up to eight with varying degrees of randomness. Set items are a subtype of legendary items which provide additional, cumulative bonuses if multiple items from the same set are simultaneously equipped. Higher level monsters tend to drop higher level items, which tend to have higher base stats and bonuses. Diablo IIIs skills window. depicting the abilities of the wizard class The proprietary engine incorporates Blizzard's custom in-house physics, and features destructible environments with an in-game damage effect. The developers sought to make the game run on a wide range of systems without requiring DirectX 10. Diablo III uses a custom 3D game engine in order to present an overhead view to the player, in a somewhat similar way to the isometric view used in previous games in the series. Enemies utilize the 3D environment as well, in ways such as crawling up the side of a wall from below into the combat area. As in Diablo II, multiplayer games are possible using Blizzard's Battle.net service, with many of the new features developed for StarCraft II also available in Diablo III. Players are also able to drop in and out of sessions of co-operative play with other players. Unlike its predecessor, Diablo III requires players to be connected to the internet constantly due to their DRM policy, even for single- player games. An enhanced quest system, a random level generator, and a random encounter generator are used in order to ensure the game provides different experiences when replayed. Unlike previous iterations, gold can be picked up merely by touching it, or coming within range (adjusted by gear) rather than having to manually pick it up. One of the new features intended to speed up gameplay is that health orbs drop from enemies, replacing the need to have a potion bar. The latter is replaced by a skill bar that allows a player to assign quick bar buttons to skills and spells; previously, players could only assign two skills (one for each mouse button) and had to swap skills with the keyboard or mousewheel. Players can still assign specific attacks to mouse buttons. Skill runes, another new feature, are skill modifiers that are unlocked as the player levels up. Unlike the socketable runes in Diablo II, skill runes are not items but instead provide options for enhancing skills, often completely changing the gameplay of each skill. For example, one skill rune for the Wizard's meteor ability reduces its arcane power cost, while another turns the meteor to ice, causing cold damage rather than fire. Hardcore mode As in Diablo II, Diablo III gives players the choice to make hardcore characters. Players are required to first level up a regular character to level 10 before they have the option to create new Hardcore characters. Hardcore characters cannot be resurrected; instead they become permanently unplayable if they are killed. Hardcore characters are separately ranked, and they can only form teams with other hardcore characters. After dying, the ghost of a hardcore character can still chat. Their name still shows up in rankings, but the character cannot return to the game. If the hardcore character reached level 10 before dying, it can be placed in the Hall of Fallen Heroes. Artisans Artisans are non-player characters (NPCs) who sell and craft. Two types of artisans can be introduced by completing a quest for each: Haedrig Eamon the Blacksmith and Covetous Shen the Jeweler. The Reaper of Souls expansion introduced the Mystic artisan, who can replace individual item enchantments and change the physical appearance of items. Artisans create items using materials the player can gather by scrapping acquired items and reducing them to their component parts. These materials are used to create items with random bonuses. Unlike Diablo II rare and magic items can also be enhanced rather than just basic weaponry and armor. Crafting can be used to train and improve the skills of the artisans rather than create new items. When artisans gain new levels, their shop reflects their higher skill level. The process of salvaging items into materials also makes inventory management easier. Blizzard stated that this crafting system was designed so that it would not slow down the pace of the game. Followers Followers are NPC allies that can accompany the player throughout the game world. There are three followers in Diablo III: Kormac the Templar, Lyndon the Scoundrel and Eirena the Enchantress, who each possess their own skills and background. As followers fight alongside the player, they gain new experience, skills, and equipment as they level up. Only one follower accompanies the player at a time, creating a gameplay strategy decision. Originally, followers were only going to appear in Normal mode; however, Jay Wilson stated at BlizzCon 2011 that followers would continue to be usable in later difficulty levels. Auction house On August 1, 2011, it was reported that Diablo III would feature two types of auction houses: one where players spend in-game gold and another where players could buy or sell virtual items for real-world money. The real-money auction house was not available in Hardcore mode. Prior to release, Blizzard stated that nearly everything that drops on the ground, including gold, could be traded with other players either directly or through the auction house system. Aside from certain bound on account items, such as the Staff of Herding needed to access the Whimsyshire easter egg, Blizzard stated there would be very few items that would be bound to a particular character and therefore untradable. In order to get rated in South Korea, Blizzard had to remove the real-money auction house from the Korean release of the game as the auction house violated Korean anti-gambling laws. In the gold- based auction house, a flat fee of 15 percent was taken from the final sale price of an auction. The real-money auction house fees were US$1, ‚Ç¨1 or ¬£1 (or equivalent) for equipment (weapons and armor) and a 15 percent fee for commodity auctions, which included items like crafting materials, blacksmith and jewelcrafting plans, and gold exchange. There was an additional 15 percent \\"cashing-out\\" fee from proceeds gained selling items in the real-money auction house. While the gold-based auction house was available to any player regardless of which region they play in, the real-money auction was restricted to players on their home region. If they used the global play function to play in a different region, they would not be able to access the real-money auction house. The real money auction house was opened on June 12, 2012 (June 15 in the Americas). In March 2013, former Diablo III game director Jay Wilson stated that he felt the existence of the auction houses \\"really hurt\\" the game. \\"I think we would turn it off if we could,\\" Wilson said during his talk. But the solution is \\"not as easy as that.\\" On September 17, 2013, Blizzard stated that both the gold and real-money auction houses would be shut down on March 18, 2014. Players had until June 24, 2014 to claim gold and items from the completed tab on the auction house interface. PvP combat Player versus player combat (PvP) was added to Diablo III in a limited form with the 1.0.7 patch in February 2013. The Brawling system provides a simple free for all area where between two and four characters can fight and defeat each other as long as they like, but without any scores or damage being tracked. Players can participate by choosing from their existing characters, with access to all of the gear and skill they have gathered from playing the game in single- player or cooperative mode. PvP content for Diablo III had been discussed throughout the game's development, but on March 9, 2012, Blizzard announced that PvP had been delayed and would not be included with the game's release. Lead designer Jay Wilson said in a post on Battle.net that the PvP Arena system would arrive in a post-release patch; it would include multiple Arena maps with themed locations and layouts, PvP-centric achievements, and a quick and easy matchmaking system. On December 27, 2012, Blizzard announced that the previously mentioned Team Deathmatch or Arena mode was canceled, because it did not have enough depth. Instead a simple PvP system would be added for the time being. That PvP mode was initially named Dueling, and was renamed to Brawling before release. Although the PvP systems initially outlined were not released, Blizzard stated that they would add other full-featured PvP systems in a free future content patch. In a May 2013 interview, Diablo III developer Wyatt Cheng stated that the development team was looking to see how the Brawling PvP evolves, while they \\"continue to work on figuring out something more objective-based.\\" Character classes The five original character classes of Diablo III. From left to right: Wizard, Witch Doctor, Demon Hunter, Barbarian, and Monk. Character creation screen with the Demon Hunter selected There are five available character classes from Diablo III and two from the Reaper of Souls expansion, for a total of seven character classes.Restoring the Balance‚ÄîNecromancer Overview - Diablo III In the previous two games each class had a fixed gender, but in Diablo III players may choose the gender. * The Witch Doctor is a new character reminiscent of the Diablo II's necromancer, but with skills more traditionally associated with shamanism and voodoo culture. The witch doctor has the ability to summon monsters, cast curses, harvest souls, and hurl poisons and explosives at their enemies. To power spells the Witch Doctor uses Mana, a vast pool of mental power which regenerates slowly. * The Barbarian was initially the only returning class from Diablo II, and according to Jay Wilson the original backstory (since discarded) envisioned the male as the older character from Diablo II. Barbarians have a variety of revamped skills at their disposal based on incredible physical prowess. The barbarian is able to whirlwind through crowds, cleave through swarms, leap across crags, crush opponents upon landing, and grapple-snap enemies into melee range. The resource used by the barbarian is fury, which is generated through attacking enemies, getting attacked by enemies, and using certain abilities. Fury is used for the barbarian's strongest abilities and degenerates over time. * The Wizard succeeds the sorceress from Diablo II and the sorcerer from Diablo. The initial backstory for the female wizard described her as a rebellious sorceress who could not be tamed. The Wizard's abilities range from shooting lightning, fire and ice at their enemies to slowing time and teleporting past enemies and through walls. Wizards fuel their spells with arcane power, which is a shallow but fast-regenerating power source. * The Monk is a melee attacker, using martial arts to cripple foes, resist damage, deflect projectiles, attack with blinding speed, and land explosive killing blows. Monk gameplay combines the melee elements of Diablo IIs assassin class with the \\"holy warrior\\" role of the paladin. Blizzard has stated that the monk is not related in any way to the monk class from the Sierra Entertainment‚Äìmade Diablo: Hellfire expansion. The monk is fueled by spirit, which has defensive purposes and is slowly generated through attacking, though it does not degenerate. * The Demon Hunter combines elements of Diablo IIs amazon and assassin classes. Demon hunters use bows and crossbows as their main weapons and can also throw small bombs and knives at enemies. The demon hunter is fueled by both discipline and hatred: hatred is a fast regenerating resource that is used for attacks, while discipline is a slow regenerating resource used for defensive abilities involving acrobatics or shadows. * The Crusader is a Reaper of Souls expansion character and is similar to the Paladin from Diablo II; in the backstory these two classes plus the Templar make up the three military orders of the Church of Zakarum. The crusader has a variety of combat skills at its disposal based on physical prowess, and typically wields a shield and an associated weapon (typically a flail). The crusader has an eclectic mix of abilities, including movement abilities to move into the thick of battle, close-quarters attacks that dispose of many nearby enemies, and many more. The resource used by the crusader is wrath, which is generated through attacking enemies, getting attacked by enemies, and using certain abilities. * The Necromancer is a death-themed spellcaster, available as downloadable content for Reaper of Souls. Described as a \\"reimagining\\" of the previous incarnation seen in Diablo II, the necromancer specializes in controlling the dead, be it by summoning minions, reviving dead enemies temporarily or using their corpses as a medium to their magical powers, while using blood magic to power their offensive and defensive abilities. The resource used by the necromancer is essence, which is generated through attacking enemies with their primary skills. Compared to the other summoning class, while the Witch Doctor's lighthearted \\"creepy crawlies\\" summons of spiders and snakes, the Necromancer has a \\"grim, visceral and dark\\" design around blood, bone and corpses. The Archivist class was presented on April 1, 2009, following in Blizzard's April Fool's Day joke tradition. All seven classes are represented in the crossover MOBA game Heroes of the Storm (2015) as playable heroes. Players can choose between Sonya (the Barbarian), Johanna (the Crusader), Valla (the Demon Hunter), Kharazim (the Monk), Xul (the Necromancer), Nazeebo (the Witch Doctor), and Li-Ming (the Wizard). Plot The game takes place in Sanctuary, the dark fantasy world of the Diablo Series, twenty years after the events of Diablo II. Deckard Cain and his niece Leah are in Tristram Cathedral (the same cathedral that was the setting of Diablo) investigating ancient texts regarding an ominous prophecy. A mysterious star falling from the sky strikes the Cathedral, creating a deep crater into which Deckard Cain disappears. ;Act I The protagonist arrives in the town of New Tristram to investigate the falling star which struck the cathedral, which is now emanating risen undead. The protagonist accompanies Leah to the cathedral in order to rescue Cain from the crater into which he fell. After rescuing Cain, the protagonist learns that the only way to the fallen star is to defeat King Leoric, the former ruler of Khanduras known now as the 'Skeleton King'. Cain informs the protagonist that Leoric's crown must be recovered to defeat him, and the protagonist searches for Leoric's crown with the aid of Haedrig Eamon, the blacksmith of New Tristram. After recovering the crown, the protagonist returns to the cathedral where he/she eventually encounters and rescues Kormac, a warrior of the Templar order who has been taken captive by members of a cult known as the Dark Coven. Together, they defeat Leoric and find a stranger where the fallen star landed. The stranger's only memory is of a sword that shattered into three pieces as he fell. The protagonist recovers the sword pieces from the Khazra Den and the Drowned Temple, opposed by the witch Maghda, leader of the Dark Coven - giving aid to a bandit named Lyndon in retrieving a false relic in the process. Maghda, however, recovers the third piece before the protagonist does and attempts to force Cain to repair the sword. Leah, however, kills the cultists with a surge of magical power, forcing Maghda to kill Cain and flee with the stranger. Cain, before dying, repairs the sword and tasks the protagonist with returning it to the stranger, revealing that both the sword and the stranger are angelic. The protagonist pursues Maghda into the bowels of King Leoric's dilapidated torture chambers underneath his manor, rescuing the stranger and returning to him his sword after a violent fight with the Butcher, a powerful demon. The stranger's memories are recovered, and it is revealed that he is the Archangel Tyrael, the Aspect of Justice. Disgusted with his fellow angels' unwillingness to protect humanity from the forces of Hell, Tyrael casts aside his divinity to become a mortal and warn Sanctuary about the arrival of the demon lords Belial (Lord of Lies) and Azmodan (Lord of Sin). ;Act II The protagonist, Leah, and Tyrael travel to the city of Caldeum. The protagonist leaves to track down Maghda at Alcarnus as per orders from Asheara, commander of the Iron Wolves (returning from Diablo II), while Leah and Tyrael search for evidence of Belial in the city sewers. The protagonist first encounters a young Enchantress who introduces herself as Eirena, who hails from a different era. With Eirena's help, the protagonist finds and stops cultists from channeling an illusion by halting their progress. Continuing on, the protagonist reaches the Khasim Outpost, finding that Belial's serpent demons have imprisoned and replaced the true guards. Freeing Captain Davyd and his men, the protagonist reclaims the Khasim Outpost from the serpent demons and is given access to Alcarnus. After freeing the prisoners, the protagonist fights Maghda in her lair and kills her, avenging Cain, then returns to Caldeum to rescue Leah from the grasp of the Imperial Guards. Gaining an audience with the young Emperor of Caldeum, Hakan II, the protagonist is blamed for the chaos at Alcarnus, and the Emperor orders the protagonist's death and that Leah be brought to him, forcing the protagonist to escape the palace. Escaping to the sewers, Leah reveals that her mother, Adria (the witch of Tristram from the original game) is still alive. The protagonist aids Leah in rescuing Adria from the city's sewers. Adria reveals that the key to stopping the forces of Hell is the Black Soulstone. Crafted by the deranged warlock Zoltun Kulle, it has the power to trap the souls of the seven Lords of Hell and destroy them forever. Leah explains that Kulle was slain by the Horadrim before he could put the finishing touches on the stone, and that his severed head was sealed off in the lush Dahlgur Oasis. Adria instructs the protagonist to find the warlock's head in the oasis if the Soulstone is to be retrieved. After the head is retrieved, Leah revives the ghost of Zoltun Kulle, and Tyrael instructs him to activate the Black Soulstone. Kulle states that two vials of his blood hidden by the Horadrim in the Desolate Sands are needed to reach the stone. Leah decides to accompany the protagonist whilst putting the warlock's head in the protagonist's packs. After recovering the two vials of blood, the protagonist ventures into Kulle's archives in search of his body, while Leah prepares the ritual to bring Kulle back. After Kulle is brought back to life, the protagonist is then led into the archive's inner sanctum where the Black Soulstone is located, but is forced to defeat Kulle when the resurrected warlock attempts to take the soulstone for himself . Upon returning to Caldeum, the protagonist finds the city under attack by Belial's forces. Leah and Adria fight their way to the palace with the protagonist, revealing Belial as having taken the form of the Emperor to deceive them, and eventually defeat him. Leah then traps Belial's soul within the Black Soulstone, freeing Caldeum, after which she has a vision of the demon lord Azmodan, who is invading Sanctuary from the crater of Mount Arreat (destroyed by Tyrael in Diablo II: Lord of Destruction) in order to retrieve the Black Soulstone and empower himself, becoming the Prime Evil. ;Act III The protagonist travels to Bastion's Keep with Tyrael, their followers, Leah and Adria only to find it under attack by Azmodan's army. Tyrael instructs the protagonist to aid the defenders, lighting the signal fires on the keep's walls, and raising the catapults. With that done, the protagonist enters the stronghold, where Azmodan's forces have breached the lower levels, defeating the demon Ghom, the Lord of Gluttony. The protagonist then takes to the battlefield, destroying Azmodan's siege weapons and traveling to the crater of Mount Arreat. Tyrael assists the protagonist in reaching the demonic gate protecting the crater, and destroys it with his sword, El'druin. After a gruesome battle with a huge Siegebreaker Assault Beast, the protagonist traverses the depths of Arreat's inner core, destroying the Sin Hearts, which empower Azmodan and his armies. Azmodan's consort Cydaea, the Maiden of Lust, attempts to protect the hearts, but is defeated by the protagonist, who then confronts and defeats Azmodan. Leah seals Azmodan's soul within the Black Soulstone. With all seven Lords of Hell trapped within the stone, Tyrael states that the Eternal Conflict between Heaven and Hell will be ended if the stone is destroyed. The protagonist returns to Bastion's Keep, but finds that Adria has betrayed them. Adria reveals she has been serving Diablo from the beginning, and that Leah's father is Leoric's son Aidan, the Dark Wanderer (the Warrior player character from the first game and Diablo's reincarnate body in Diablo II), who was possessed by Diablo. Adria uses the Black Soulstone to resurrect Diablo while forcing Leah to serve as his vessel. With all the souls of the Lords of Hell now within him, Diablo becomes the Prime Evil, and begins an assault on the High Heavens. ;Act IV The protagonist arrives in the High Heavens to find that it is already under attack. Imperius, the Aspect of Valor, blames the protagonist and Tyrael for their downfall, causing Tyrael to give in to despair. On the other hand, the protagonist remains determined to fight, and defeats the demon Iskatu. The protagonist then meets Itherael, the Aspect of Fate, who instructs him to rescue Auriel, the Aspect of Hope, from Rakanoth, the Lord of Despair, in the Library of Fate. After rescuing Auriel and returning hope to the forces of Heaven, the protagonist is then instructed by Auriel to close the Hell Rifts. After this is done, the protagonist finds Tyrael, who has overcome his despair. Together, they attempt to stop Diablo from reaching the Crystal Arch, the source of power for the forces of Heaven, but not before a brawl with Izual, Tyrael's corrupted former lieutenant. After a long and fierce battle, Diablo is defeated and his physical manifestation is destroyed. The Black Soulstone is shown falling from the High Heavens, still intact. After the battle, Tyrael decides to rejoin the Angiris Council as the new Aspect of Wisdom, but remains a mortal, dedicated to building a permanent alliance between angels and humans. Development Development on Diablo III began in 2001 when Blizzard North was still in operation, and the game was announced on June 28, 2008, at the Blizzard Worldwide Invitational in Paris, France. The original artistic design differed from that shown at Blizzard Worldwide Invitational 2008 demonstration, and had undergone three revisions before reaching the standards felt necessary by the team behind Diablo III. It was announced that the game would be simultaneously released on both Windows and macOS platforms, and would require a constant internet connection to play, even for single-player mode. The proprietary engine incorporates Blizzard's custom in-house physics, a change from the original usage of Havok's physics engine, and features destructible environments with an in-game damage effect. Diablo IIIs lead designer was Jay Wilson, a former Relic Entertainment designer credited with work on Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War and Company of Heroes, as well as Blood II: The Chosen for Monolith Productions. The lead world designer was Leonard Boyarsky, one of the six co-creators of Fallout. On May 9, 2011, Blizzard announced that the game was expected to be released for external beta testing in Q3 of 2011. On September 7, 2011, Blizzard community manager Bashiok confirmed the start of the closed public beta test of the game with limited external testing by employees and their families. Testers were not restricted by a non-disclosure agreement. The beta began on April 20, 2012, and closed on May 1, 2012. Following the beta, the game officially released for Windows and OS X on May 15, 2012. Updates On June 11, 2012, it was announced at the 2012 Apple Worldwide Developers Conference keynote that native retina display support would be coming to Diablo III. The following day, a Blizzard representative confirmed via the official Battle.net forums Apple's statement, the ongoing work by the developer on the optimization of the game engine for its rendering on the Retina display (and technically on other similar future high-density monitors) and that this optimization was mainly for aesthetic purposes. Patch 1.0.4 introduced the paragon leveling system. After reaching the level cap of 60, characters continue to accumulate experience points, gaining paragon levels (up to a cap of 100), each of which provides a bonus to core stats (making characters more powerful and durable) and magic find and gold find (increasing the quantity and average quality of loot drops). Patch 1.0.5 expanded the difficulty settings with the addition of the Monster Power system. In addition to the Normal/Nightmare/Hell/Inferno difficulty system, players can also set Monster Power at any level from 0 to 10, with each level of Monster Power increasing the damage, health points, experience point yield and loot drop rates beyond the base value for a given difficulty tier. The first PvP addition to the game was in February 2013, as part of patch 1.0.7; a simple free-for-all system called \\"Brawling\\" and multiple item crafting options. For Diablo 20th anniversary, it was announced during BlizzCon 2016 that Diablo III would receive a free patch called The Darkening of Tristam that would recreate the original game. The patch contained a 16-level dungeon, four main bosses from the 1996 version and special graphics filters and 8-directions limited movement like the original game. The patch released on November 4, 2016. Console development On January 10, 2012, Blizzard community manager Bashiok tweeted \\"Yup. Josh Mosqueira is lead designer for the Diablo III console project\\" however a Blizzard spokesperson later clarified that Bashiok's tweet was only \\"intended as a confirmation that Blizzard is actively exploring the possibility of developing a console version of Diablo III,\\" adding, \\"This is not a confirmation that Diablo III is coming to any console platform.\\" At Sony's Press Conference on February 20, 2013, Chris Metzen announced that Diablo III would release on both PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4. Activision Blizzard stated in their first-quarter 2013 earnings report, that the PlayStation 3 version of Diablo III would be released in 2013. On June 6, 2013, Blizzard announced that both the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 port of the game would be released on September 3, 2013. A PS3 version of the game was published and localized by Square Enix in Japan, released there on January 30, 2014. In August 2013, Diablo III developers stated that they had started on the PlayStation 4 development of the game, titled Diablo III: Ultimate Evil Edition, and were looking at how to best utilize the new features of the PS4 controller, such as the TouchPad and the Share button. In May 2014, Blizzard announced that Diablo III: Ultimate Evil Edition would be released on August 19, bringing the game to the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. The game runs at a display resolution of 1080p on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. On June 27, 2017, Diablo III: Eternal Collection, which includes all content from previous expansions, was released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. It was later released for the Nintendo Switch as well, which included exclusive content based on Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda series and features Amiibo support. Reaper of Souls expansion At Gamescom 2013, Diablo III: Reaper of Souls was announced as the first expansion pack for the game. It features the fallen angel of wisdom Malthael as the expansion's main villain and is set in the city of Westmarch, which takes inspiration from many Gothic medieval locations. The expansion includes a new hero called the Crusader, an increased level cap to level 70, major improvements to loot drops including the ability to change item stats using an enchanting system, the ability to change the look of an item using transmogrification, and an improved Paragon leveling system which is account- wide and does not have a level cap. Reaper of Souls was released on March 25, 2014, for the Windows and macOS versions of Diablo III. The expansion pack content was released as part of the Diablo III: Ultimate Evil Edition version for consoles on August 19 for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. That edition expanded the base Diablo III game on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and brought the game for the first time to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. A second expansion was being worked on at the time of Reaper of Soul's release, but was later abandoned by Blizzard with the developers predominantly moving over to World of Warcraft. Music Russell Brower wrote the original score for the game, with additional music being composed by Derek Duke, Glenn Stafford, Joseph Lawrence, Neal Acree, Laurence Juber, and Edo Guidotti. When composing for the orchestra, Brower tried to respect the Wagnerian style from the expansion to the second game in the series, Lord of Destruction. The Overture is considered the main theme of the game and it has been performed by the Eminence Symphony Orchestra, and was released on iTunes in 2009, as a single. A similar composition was used in the cinematic teaser trailer of the game. The Tristram theme from the first Diablo, also used in the second game, is present in Diablo III with some changes.. Irish choral ensemble An√∫na also feature on the soundtrack. Brower stated that \\"Working somewhat against conventional expectations, Hell is a beautiful and seductive sound, provided by Dublin‚Äôs uniquely astounding choral group AN√öNA\\". A full soundtrack was released on iTunes at the same time of the game's release, as well as part of the Collector's Edition of the game. Marketing and release People queuing for the release in Uppsala, Sweden Diablo III was released on May 15, 2012. Players had the options to buy one of two retail boxed versions, a standard edition and collector's edition, or could also pre-order directly from Battle.net and download the installer in advance. On May 14, 2012, players who bought the downloadable version from Battle.net could install the rest of the game including patches. On May 15, 2012, the retail version could be bought from stores doing midnight launches such as GameStop. The Diablo III Battle.net servers went live at this point, people who downloaded the game could begin playing. Initially the launches were hindered by heavy server load with many users getting various errors, including the error 37 which reads; \\"The servers are busy at this time. Please try again later\\". These issues made the game unplayable for those affected, while some others experienced in-game bugs. Despite assurances from Blizzard that the problems leading to the connection errors during Diablo IIIs launch had been resolved, Eurogamer reported on May 31, 2012, that these errors were still ongoing, and had reappeared after patch 1.0.2 was released for the game. Many fans complained that the ongoing problems had caused them to lose their hardcore (permanent death) characters. In South Korea, players waited up to 36 hours to purchase the collector's edition. The release was also the source of a minor controversy in Australia when retailer Game went into voluntary administration the day before the release, and so was unable to honor pre-orders or offer refunds. In response to this, Blizzard Entertainment offered affected customers credit in purchasing the digital version of the game. On April 23, 2015, the game was released in China as it was approved by the Ministry of Culture. It used to be sold under the name \\"Big Pineapple\\" (Â§ßËè†Ëêù D…ë Boluo) which sounds similar to Diablo in Mandarin Chinese in order to dodge the sales ban. World of Warcraft promotion Starting at BlizzCon in October 2011, Blizzard offered an \\"annual pass\\" for World of Warcraft, where players who signed up for a 12-month subscription to that game received a free digital copy of Diablo III once released, as well as guaranteed beta access for the Mists of Pandaria expansion to World of Warcraft and a special Diablo-inspired mount called Tyrael's Charger in World of Warcraft. A demo version of the game, called the Starter Edition, was released simultaneously with the full release. It provides a limited introduction to the game where players can complete Act 1 up to the Skeleton King boss encounter with a level cap of 13. Originally after Diablo IIIs release the Starter Edition was only available through a guest pass code, which was included with the boxed versions of the game. Players have the option to upgrade to the full game through their Battle.net accounts. The Starter Edition became available to all users a few months after release on August 15, 2012. Reception Diablo III received \\"generally positive reviews\\" from critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic. GamesRadar+ was positive about the game's opening act and its nods to past Diablo games saying \\"we liked what we saw\\". IGN was positive about the new skill system stating \\"Instead of gameplay like Diablo II, where I often regretted how I allotted my ability points, Diablo III encourages experimentation and finding out exactly what works for your play-style. It's a vastly superior way to handle character abilities\\", and praised the overall gameplay, stating \\"the new systems really do make it a lot easier to enjoy Diablo III\\". IGN further praised the game's new gameplay design, in particular the rune and loot systems, the randomly generated levels and the game's enjoyable unpredictability. It stated the game's feel is quite intuitive and also praised the game's sound and voicing. Rock, Paper, Shotgun gave mixed commentary during the game's beta period, praising the actual game itself by stating that it is much more direct than its predecessors and intuitive in its interface. However, it said the playing experience is spoiled due to lag in single-player mode caused by a lack of an offline single-player mode. Following the game's release, it reaffirmed its displeasure at the always- online DRM and offered a mixed opinion that the game was enjoyable but added \\"nothing new\\" to its genre. Users have voiced criticism about the game's strong digital rights management which requires what is known as persistent online authentication, resulting in the lack of an offline single-player mode. Erik Kain, a Forbes contributing writer, stated that the requirement to remain online is not necessary for single-player mode and that Blizzard is abusing its position as a \\"juggernaut\\" and is setting a worrying precedent for the gaming industry. In response to questions about the lack of offline single- player, Diablo III senior producer Alex Mayberry said, \\"Obviously StarCraft II did it, World of Warcraft authenticates also. It's kind of the way things are, these days. The world of gaming is not the same as it was when Diablo II came out.\\" Gaming Blend supported the game's fanbase (referring to the user ratings on Metacritic and Amazon) and rejected counter-criticisms of the community. It claims that the gaming industry at large is far too defensive of production companies' actions, to the point of accepting backward steps in game availability. William Usher, the article's author said, \\"Journalists should have been acknowledging consumer distaste rather than fueling it with pro- corporate pandering.\\" While Gaming Blend disliked the always-online DRM, it did give the game a positive review. It stated the game includes interesting opportunities for experimentation and has great appeal for replaying over and over. The review concluded the game is \\"smooth and entertaining\\". A GameArena critic questioned how Blizzard managed to \\"fail so spectacularly at creating reliable networking for Diablo 3\\" before going on to point out the lack of competitive multiplayer. Many users criticized the art direction as it was considered too bright and colourful in contrast to the darker atmosphere of the previous releases. This led to petitions demanding Blizzard to change the design. The lead producer Keith Lee responded to these criticisms and explaining the design choices by stating that \\"We feel that color actually helps to create a lot of highlights in the game so that there is contrast.\\" He also highlighted that unlike the previous games, the players explore outdoors. The Black Soulstone footage won the 'Outstanding Visual Effects in an Animated Commercial or Video Game Trailer' award from the Visual Effects Society. The Switch version was nominated for the Freedom Tower Award for Best Remake at the New York Game Awards 2019. The 2012 PC release of Diablo III received nominations for \\"Role-Playing/Massively Multiplayer Game of the Year\\", \\"Outstanding Achievement in Online Gameplay\\", \\"Outstanding Achievement in Original Music Composition\\" and \\"Outstanding Achievement in Sound Design\\" at the 16th Annual D.I.C.E. Awards. A year later at the 17th Annual D.I.C.E. Awards, the 2013 console version of Diablo III won the award for \\"Role- Playing/Massively Multiplayer Game of the Year\\", along with a nomination for \\"Online Game of the Year\\". Sales Before its release, Diablo III broke several presale records and became the most pre-ordered PC game to date on Amazon. Activision Blizzard reported that Diablo III had broken the one-day PC sales records, accumulating over 3.5 million sales in the first 24 hours after release and over 6.3 million sales in its first week, including the 1.2 million people who obtained Diablo III through the World of Warcraft annual pass. On its first day, the game amassed 4.7 million players worldwide, an estimate which includes those who obtained the game via the World of Warcraft annual pass. In its 2012 second quarter report, Diablo III was reported to have pushed Activision Blizzard's expectations and , more than 10 million people had played the game. Diablo III remains the fastest selling PC game to date, and also one of the best-selling PC video games. As of the end of 2012, it had sold more than 12 million copies, and , Blizzard stated that Diablo III had around 1 million daily players, with 3 million unique players each month. By May 2013, Diablo III had been played by 14.5 million unique players. and had sold over 30 million copies worldwide by August 2015. Controversies South Korea On May 28, 2012, Blizzard Entertainment's offices in South Korea were raided by the Fair Trade Commission amid allegations that the company had breached consumer rights laws, including suspected violations of Korea's law on electronic commerce and commercial contracts. Players in Korea requested refunds from Blizzard based on their inability to play Diablo III, but Blizzard cited the terms of sale and refused to grant these requests. Hundreds of gamers filed formal complaints with the FTC, and in June 2012 Blizzard started offering players full refunds. France On June 15, 2012, French consumers group UFC Que Choisir announced that it had received 1,500 complaints in four days regarding connectivity issues with Diablo III. As a result of this, the organization asked Blizzard Entertainment to provide a permanent solution by June 30, 2012, and to \\"communicate completely and transparently about problems encountered in due time\\". They also requested that gamers be given reimbursement for any troubles they may have encountered. In addition, they asked the French government to take a closer look at games with online-only DRM. On June 28, Blizzard replied to the Que Choisir that the box for Diablo III clearly labelled that a high-speed internet connection was required and that most of the stability issues had been fixed. Germany The threatened legal action if Blizzard did not respond to complaints about Diablo IIIs lack of clear information on the German version of the box by July 27, 2012, regarding the always-online requirement and lack of ability to resell the digital game.

In 1940, with writer George Kapitan, Sahle co-created the Timely character the Black Widow, comics' first costumed, superpowered female protagonist. Sahle also created the long-running, early teen-humor character Candy, writing and drawing her comic misadventures for most of the character's 1944 to 1956 run in Quality Comics' Police Comics and in her own solo title, as well as in a newspaper comic strip. Biography Early career Harry Sahle was born in Cleveland to Edward Sahle and Sarah Jewell.Cuyahoga County, Ohio, Marriage Records and Indexes, 1810-1973 His mother died when he was young and he grew up in Cleveland with his father and his father's parents, who were both born in Switzerland.1930 United States Federal Census Sahle drew gag cartoons for Boys' Life magazine between 1938 and 1939, before entering the fledgling medium of comic books via the Harry \\"A\\" Chesler Studio and Funnies Inc., two Manhattan-based \\"packagers\\" that provided complete, outsourced comics for early publishers testing the medium.Harry Sahle at the Lambiek Comiclopedia Among his earliest comics work is a cover for the only issue of Pelican Publications' Green Giant Comics (Jan. 1940).Comic Book Database: Green Giant Comics #1 Accessed September 7, 2008. .

Not to be confused with the superhero Black Widow introduced in the 1960s by Timely's descendant Marvel Comics, this character -- comics' first costumed, superpowered female protagonist -- was a supernatural antihero who gathered deserving souls for Satan.The Black Widow (1940) at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. Archived from the original October 25, 2011. Other early work includes co-creating the winged superhero the Air Man in Centaur Publications' Keen Detective Funnies #23 (Aug. 1940); and creating or co-creating the Timely superheroine the Silver Scorpion, in Daring Mystery Comics #7 (April 1941), for which he signed his art with the pen name Jewell, which comics historian Michael J. Vassallo believes marked a collaboration with another, unknown artist.\\"The Silver Scorpion\\", Daring Mystery Comics #7 at the Grand Comics Database Sahle also worked as an assistant to Carl Burgos, creator-artist of Timely star the Human Torch. Per fellow artist and Golden Age contemporary Gil Kane, Sahle was also occasionally a ghost artist on work credited to Burgos in issues of Marvel Mystery Comics, Captain America Comics, and the eponymous character's own title, Human Torch. MLJ Comics Artist Gil Kane recalled that after the writers and artists Charles Biro, Bob Wood, Bob Montana and several others left MLJ Comics to move to Lev Gleason Publications, it fell largely to Irv Novick to steer MLJs stable of superhero characters. Shortly afterward, Sahle joined the company, working on characters including The Black Hood, Steel Sterling, and the Shield between 1942 and 1943, and soon thereafter working on the character that was to become MLJ's breakout success: Archie Andrews. With the departure of Montana, Archie's signature early developer, Sahle drew \\"what became the new Archie character.... [H]is work was based on Montana, but with adaptation and interpretation\\", Kane recalled. Sahle drew some of the earliest stories featuring what would become the company's namesake character, beginning by at least Archie Comics #3 (Summer 1943). Thanks to his work, \\"Sahle became the center point [of MLJ/Archie], and Novick went into the Army\\", recalled Kane, who believes Sahle worked for MLJ for a year-and-a-half before joining the Army himself. At some point, Sahle was hired away from MLJ by \\"Busy\\" Arnold and his Quality Comics. \\"Candy\\" Sahle went on to create the Quality Comics teen-humor feature \\"Candy,\\" starring typical small-town American girl Candace O'Connor of Hartwick, USA.Candy at Don Markstein's Toonopedia.

Debuting as a backup feature in Police Comics #37 (Dec. 1944), \\"Candy\\" appeared in the comic until issue #102 (Oct. 1950), when the regular line-up of characters (including Candy, Will Eisner's The Spirit, etc.) were dropped and the title became a \\"regular crime comic.\\"Miller, J.

In addition to Candy's comic-book adventures, Sahle and writer Elmer Groggin produced a Candy newspaper comic strip syndicated by the Chicago Times Syndicate from October 2, 1944. Sometime during 1945, Sahle's strip was then taken over by Tom Dorr, who continued it for a further 25 years (mostly syndicated by the Field Newspaper Syndicate, which succeeded the Chicago Times Syndicate). Much of Sahle's work was produced in the teen-humor genre, and during the 1940s he also drew another feature, \\"Ezra,\\" for Quality's Military Comics and Modern Comics titles. Sahle died in New York City 1950, aged 38. Kane blamed his death on a \\"broken heart\\" at a young age. Mike Hammer Crime novelist Mickey Spillane, who worked for Lloyd Jacquet's Funnies Inc. packager during the 1930s and 1940s, teamed with Sahle on a number of occasions, including on the character \\"Mike Danger\\", which Spillane described as \\"the original concept of Mike Hammer\\", the archetypal hardboiled detective of mid-20th century paperback novels. After Spillane's novels were successful, some \\"Mike Danger\\" stories saw print in issues of Crime Detector in 1954, and new stories featuring the character were published by Big Entertainment four decades later.Mike Danger (character) at the Grand Comics Database.

He was from the Jarchud clan of the Mongol Uriankhai. His father was Yuan dynasty general Uriyangkhadai and his grandfather was Subutai, the honored general and Noyan of Genghis Khan. Biography In 1253 he followed his father and conquered the Kingdom of Dali. Uriyangkhadai and Aju led 3,000 Mongols and more than 10,000 troops from Dali tribes to northern Vietnam in 1255. The king of the Tr·∫ßn Dynasty agreed to send tribute after his defeat in open battle. This arrangement lasted until the reign of Kublai Khan.; He and his father supported the forces of M√∂ngke Khan and Kublai Khan in 1258. Aju commanded a tumen of 10,000 men. They conquered 13 cities within 2 years and destroyed 40,000 troops of the Song Dynasty while his father was ill. After the occupation of Chingzhoua and Yovajiyu, Uryankhadai met prince Kublai at Echjou. When Kublai succeeded the throne in 1260, Aju stayed in his palace. The following year, he was ordered to lead Yuan troops in Lianshui (Ê∂üÊ∞¥). He crushed Song armies and navies from 1261 to 1275. He captured Fancheng (Ê®äÂüé) by using Khotan artillery during the Battle of Xiangyang and its governor committed suicide. In 1276, Aju was appointed to defend Beshbalik from Kaidu, a grandson of √ñgedei. He died after the defeat of Prince Sarban, who revolted against his master Kublai, in 1287.

It is one of four battalions of the Royal New South Wales Regiment and is currently a Reserve unit attached to the 5th Brigade, 2nd Division. In its present form 1/19 RNSWR was raised in 1971 with the amalgamation of the 1st Battalion and the 19th Battalion. These two units were previously linked between 1930 and 1939, although they can trace their lineage back to 1854 with the formation of a number of Volunteer Rifles units as part of the New South Wales colonial defence force. The battalion's headquarters is located in Romani Barracks, Orange, with four rifle companies spread across Wagga Wagga, Bathurst, Dubbo, and Canberra. History The 1st/19th Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment was formed in 1971 as part of the Citizens Military Force (later known as the Australian Army Reserve) with the amalgamation of the 1st and 19th Battalions. The battalion had previously existed for a short time during the years between the First and Second World Wars, having been linked on 1 July 1930 when the decision was made to amalgamate a number of infantry battalions due to manpower shortages and financial constraints that resulted from the suspension of the compulsory training scheme and the Great Depression.Keogh 1965, p. 44. During this time, the battalion was known as the 1st/19th Battalion (City of Sydney's Own Regiment). In 1939, with the prospect of war looming, the Australian government decided to expand the size of the Army, and as a consequence the 1st/19th was split once more and re-raised in their own right. These two units had previously existed as separate entities with their own lineages that can be traced back to the earliest infantry units raised in New South Wales prior to Federation, which participated in a number of conflicts including the Mahdist War, the Boer War, and the First World War. By virtue of these predecessor units, the 1st/19th Battalion is the custodian of a number of battle honours from these conflicts. The battalion also maintains the battle honours of a number of units from the Second World War. Even though during the conflict the 1st Battalion was not deployed overseas on active service, the 19th Battalion was, being sent to New Guinea in 1944 and then later taking part in the New Britain campaign. The 1st/19th Battalion also maintains the battle honours of two Second Australian Imperial Force units, the 2/1st and 2/19th Battalions, which served in North Africa, Greece, New Guinea, Malaya and Borneo. 1st/19th RNSWR A Company \\"The Riverina Company\\" in Wagga Wagga Following the end of the Second World War, these battalions were disbanded, and although the part-time military force, known as the Citizens Military Force, was re-raised in 1948,Grey 2008, p. 200. initially neither the 1st or the 19th Battalions were reformed at this time. In 1957, the 1st Battalion returned to the order of battle, when it was re-raised as the 1st Infantry Battalion (Commando), City of Sydney's Own Regiment. In 1960, following the introduction of the Pentropic divisional establishment into the Australian Army, this battalion was reduced to a company-sized unit in the newly raised 1st Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment. The Pentropic establishment did not last long and in 1965, when the Army returned to the previous Tropical establishment, the City of Sydney's Company was re-raised as a battalion in its own right. In 1966, the 19th Battalion was also re-raised as a battalion of the Royal New South Wales Regiment, attached at divisional-level to the Headquarters 2nd Division and taking on the role of a special conditions, or \\"Bushman's Rifles\\", battalion of the Citizens Military Force, offering National Servicemen from remote areas flexible training options in order to allow them to complete their service obligations. In 1971, the decision was made to amalgamate the two battalions once more, and as a consequence the 1st/19th Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment was formed, being officially established on 1 May 1971. In August 1971, the battalion was entrusted with the 1st Battalion's Colours and the following year, on 13 August 1972, 1/19 RNSWR received the Colours of the 19th Battalion, in a ceremony at Holsworthy Barracks, presided over by the Governor of New South Wales, Sir Roden Cutler. Since formation, 1/19 RNSWR, as part of the 5th Brigade, has continued to cater for the training needs of Reservists in regional areas, although after 1995 the unit no longer officially functioned as a \\"special conditions\\" battalion as all Reserve units were required to offer their soldiers flexible conditions after that date. In 1996 the battalion was decentralised and moved from Ingleburn, to four regional depots at Orange, Wagga Wagga, Bathurst and Dubbo. During the 2000 Summer Olympics, 1/19 RNSWR provided personnel to undertake search tasks as part of the Australian Army's security operations. In 2006, as part of Operation Acolyte, the battalion performed a similar role in support of the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne. Other recent activities undertaken by the battalion include a company-sized deployment to New Zealand to take part in exercises with other regional Reserve forces, various ceremonial duties and a continued commitment to contributing to Rifle Company Butterworth in Malaysia. In May 2010, the battalion provided a platoon-sized element to Operation Anode Rotation 21 for service in the Solomon Islands as part of the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands. This force returned to Australia in August 2010.

Early life Eugene was born in New York City as Frank Eugene Smith. His father was Frederick Smith, a German baker who changed his last name from Schmid after moving to America in the late 1850s. His mother was Hermine Selinger Smith, a singer who performed in local German beer halls and theaters. About 1880, Eugene began to photograph for amusement, possibly while he was attending the City College of New York. In 1886, he moved to Munich in order to attend the Bavarian Academy of Fine Arts, where he studied drawing and stage design. Career Frank Eugene: Adam and Eve, taken 1898, published in Camera Work no. 30, 1910 After graduating from the Bavarian Academy of Fine Arts, he started a career as a theatrical portraitist, drawing portraits of actors and actresses. He continued his interest in photography, although little is known of his teachers or influences. He returned to the United States, and in 1899, he exhibited photographs at the Camera Club of New York under name Frank Eugene. The critic Sadakichi Hartmann wrote a review of the show, saying \\"It is the first time that a truly artistic temperament, a painter of generally recognized accomplishments and ability asserts itself in American photography.\\" A year later he was elected to The Linked Ring, and fourteen of his prints were shown that year in a major London exhibition. Already at this stage in his career he had developed a highly distinctive style that was influenced by his training as a painter. He assertively manipulated his negatives with both scratches and brush strokes, creating prints that had the appearance of a blend between painting and photography. When his prints were shown at the Camera Club in New York, one reviewer commented that his work was \\"unphotographic photography.\\" In the summer of 1900, an entire issue of Camera Notes was devoted to his art, an honor accorded only a few other photographers. In early 1901, he traveled to Egypt. He returned a few months later and met with photographer F. Holland Day in Narragansett, R.I., during the summer. In late 1902, Eugene becomes a Founder of the Photo-Secession and a member of its governing Council. In 1904, a gravure of his was published in Camera Work, No. 5 (January). Move to Germany In 1906, Eugene moved permanently to Germany. He was recognized there both as a painter and a photographer, but initially he worked primarily with prominent painters such as Fritz von Uhde, Hendrik Heyligers, Willi Geiger, and Franz Roh. He photographed many of these and other artists at the same time. He also designed tapestries that he used as backgrounds in his photographs. A year later he became a lecturer on pictorial photography at Munich's Lehr-und Versuchs-anstalt fur Photo graphie und Reproduktions-technik (Teaching and Research Institute for Photography and the Reproductive Processes). At this point, photography rather than painting became his primary interest. He experimented with the new color process of Autochromes, and three of his color prints are exhibited at Alfred Stieglitz's Photo-Secession Galleries in New York. In 1909, two more of his gravures were published in Camera Work, No. 25 (January). In 1910, twenty-seven of his photographs were exhibited at a major exhibition in Buffalo, New York. The catalog for this show described Eugene as the first photographer to make successful platinum prints on Japan tissue. Ten more of his gravures published in Camera Work, No.30 (April), and fourteen additional images appear in No.31 (July). More than any other photographer of the early 20th century, Eugene was recognized as the master of the manipulated image. Photographic historian Weston Naef described his style this way: > The very boldness with which Eugene manipulated the negative by scratching > and painting forced even those with strong sympathy for the purist line of > thinking like White, Day and Stieglitz to admire Eugene's particular > touch...[he] created a new syntax for the photographic vocabularity, for no > one before him had hand-worked negatives with such painterly intentions and > a skill unsurpassed by his successors. In 1913, he was appointed Royal Professor of Pictorial Photography by the Royal Academy of the Graphic Arts of Leipzig. This professorship, created especially for Eugene, is the first chair for pictorial photography anywhere in the world. Two years later Eugene gave up his U.S. citizenship and became a citizen of Germany. He continued teaching for many years and was head of the photography department at the Royal Academy until it closed in 1927. Eugene died of heart failure in Munich in 1936.

These include blued steel, stainless steel, polymer frame, and \\"Ultralite\\" variants constructed of aluminum and titanium, with steel lockwork components. Much like Smith & Wesson revolvers, Model 85s can come equipped with exposed, \\"bobbed\\" (850), or shrouded (851) hammers. However, there are a number of significant internal differences between the Taurus 85 and similar Smith & Wesson revolvers. Because of these differences, Taurus has been able to keep costs relatively low. However, those same differences can make customization of the Model 85 more expensive. There are numerous cosmetic options, including gold-plated hardware and grips of wood or pearl. The Model 85 is available with either 2\\" or 3\\" barrels, is capable of firing +P rated .38 Special rounds, and utilizes a transfer bar safety. Models manufactured after 1997 feature the Taurus Security System, which consists of a keyed, quarter-turn style socket-head screw which can be set to prevent the hammer from pivoting back into the frame, thus rendering the weapon inoperative. The Model 85 line has been enlarged to include the Model 856. This model is similar to the Model 85, but adds an additional round in the cylinder to bring the Model 856's capacity to 6 rounds. The View, also known as the model 85VTA, was introduced in 2014. It has a 1.41 inch barrel, an aluminum frame and titanium cylinder, and a clear polycarbonate side plate for an unloaded weight of 9.5 ounces.Taurus USA Product Catalog, p. 9 Unlike other models, the View is only rated for standard pressure .38 Special ammunition.

People from South Asian countries like Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka and Southeast Asian nation like the Philippines are trafficked into Kuwait. Kuwait along with Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia is in Tier 4 rank which has greater wealth, but a worse human trafficking situation.  Crime by type   Terrorism  Threat of terrorist attack is a matter of concern. In the early 70's the terrorism threat was mostly against government targets perpetrated by various Palestinian factions. During the Iran - Iraq conflict terrorism was mainly by Iranian agents and supporters, where several bombings took place in public places including a suicide car bomb attempt against the ruler which failed. Also during the military buildup for Gulf War II there was a heightened terrorism threat by extremists with several attacks targeting foreigners. The government cracked down very hard against the budding extremist threat, and several high-profile confrontations took place. That along with strong action by the Saudi Arabian regime, seemed to have eliminated or greatly reduced the threat and Kuwait has not had a terrorist incident since 2005. Several Kuwaiti men linked to extremist elements have been known to have gone to Iraq to fight coalition forces, but that seems to have abated as local Iraqi militants seemed eager to use them as \\"suicide bombers\\" without the persons knowledge or consent. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) of the Government of Australia reported there is a high threat of terrorist attack in Kuwait. DFAT claimed they received reports that terrorists are masterminding attacks against assets belonging to the Government of Kuwait, hotels, restaurants and Western interests.Kuwait Government of Australia, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade The United States Department of State reported terrorists in the past attacked hotel chains which they believed belonged to westerners. Western housing complexes were also targeted by terrorist organizations. Terrorism in Kuwait may include bombing, hijacking, hostage taking, kidnapping and assassination. Both military and civilians are the potential targets of terrorist groups. According to the US State Department, terrorists can target oil infrastructure, public transportation, schools, places of worship, clubs, shopping complexes, etc., due to increased security measures in official US facilities. Although these places are potential targets of terrorist organization, DFAT emphasized \\"that attacks could occur at anytime, anywhere in Kuwait\\".

History  Origins  the Hottinger Family Swiss Coat of Arm The Banque Messieurs Rougemont & Hottinguer was launched in Paris by Baron Jean-Conrad Hottinguer in 1786. The bank was located in the H√¥tel de Beaupreaux in front of the Banque de France. In 1789, Jean-Conrad Hottinger changed the bank's name to Messieurs Hottinguer & Cie. In 1800, he was appointed regent of the Banque de France. In 1833, Baron Jean‚ÄìHenri Hottinguer took the helms of Hottingeur & Cie. In 1848, the bank bought Banque Delessert and moved the family home to the H√¥tel Hottinguer on rue de la Baume in Paris. In 1866, Baron Rodolphe Hottinguer took over the Hottinger Bank. In 1920, Henry Hottinger took over his father at the head of the group. The balcony of the Cercle de la rue Royale in Paris by Tissot. Baron Rodolphe Hottinguer is in the picture, sitting on the sofa, without hat.  International development  In 1981, Baron Henri Hottinger (1934‚Äì2015) sought to further expand the Hottinger Group by launching operations in London, New York, Nassau and Luxembourg, which were independently capitalised and regulated in their respective jurisdictions by the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF) in Luxembourg, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the US, and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the UK. In 2008, after a tenuous family feud for control of the dynasty's bank, the Baron Henri Hottinger gained control of the group. Between 2009 and 2013, Baron Henri and his sons (Rodolphe and Fr√©d√©ric) resigned their executive positions at Hottinger & Cie.  2015 Bankruptcy  In 2013 Hottinger & Partners, a franchise asset management business, was involved in an embezzlement scandal. Fabien Gaglio, a banker with the subsidiary office, confessed in January 2013 to the police he ran a Ponzi scheme on his own terms for 15 years, and stated that he had lost all the proceeds of his scheme. This confession led many of the bank's clients to sue Hottinger & Cie. Gaglio was sentenced to 5 years in a Luxembourg prison (1/2 on parole) and a ‚Ç¨150,000 fine. The lack of serious prosecution regarding this affair led many of the bank's unfortunate clients to believe Gaglio had stage-managed his confession to hide a wider scheme. In October 2015, the Finma opened an investigation for bankruptcy on the Zurich-based Hottinger & Cie AG Bank opened since 1968. In 2015, Heritage Bank and Standard Chartered bought assets from the bankrupted Hottinger & Cie. In its capacity as depository, witnessed significant losses. The Swiss division closed its doors in 2015. From Bank to Family Office Following the death of Baron Henri Hottinger in 2015, his son Fr√©d√©ric Hottinger inherited the vast majority of his father's estate, in particular Groupe Financi√®re Hottinger & Co. (Hottinger Group). Upon receiving his inheritance Fr√©d√©ric Hottinger began merger discussions with Archimedes Private Office, a multi-family office regarded as complementary to the existing Hottinger business. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) approved the merger of Hottinger and Archimedes on 26 July 2016 with Hottinger Group now maintaining offices in London, Dublin, New York and Geneva. The Luxembourg division of Groupe Financi√®re Hottinger & Co was not part of the merger. In 2017, Iteram Investments, the fund management business of Alexandre Col, merged with Hottinger Luxembourg.

Such is not the case for the two other, unofficial trails, one to the west of Mt Seymour and Mt Elsay, which continues on as the Indian Arm Trail after the point where one can head down to Elsay Lake, the other midway up the slopes above Indian Arm from the Mt Seymour access road to Elsay Creek, thence following the creek up to a junction with the official trail.

At a cellular level, involution is characterized by the process of proteolysis of the basement membrane (basal lamina), leading to epithelial regression and apoptosis, with accompanying stromal fibrosis. The consequent reduction in cell number and reorganization of stromal tissue leads to the reduction in the size of the organ. Examples Thymus The thymus continues to grow between birth and puberty and then begins to atrophy, a process directed by the high levels of circulating sex hormones. Proportional to thymic size, thymic activity (T cell output) is most active before puberty. Upon atrophy, the size and activity are dramatically reduced, and the organ is primarily replaced with fat. The atrophy is due to the increased circulating level of sex hormones, and chemical or physical castration of an adult results in the thymus increasing in size and activity. Uterus Involution is the process by which the uterus is transformed from pregnant to non-pregnant state. This period is characterized by the restoration of ovarian function in order to prepare the body for a new pregnancy. It is a physiological process occurring after parturition; the hypertrophy of the uterus has to be undone since it does not need to house the fetus anymore. This process is primarily due to the hormone oxytocin. The completion of this period is defined as when the diameter of the uterus returns to the size it is normally during a woman's menstrual cycle. Mammary gland During pregnancy until after birth, mammary glands grow steadily to a size required for optimal milk production. At the end of breastfeeding, the number of cells in the mammary gland becomes reduced until approximately the same number is reached as before the start of pregnancy.

Biography Career Baron Hottinguer Coat of Arms In 1784, Hottinguer left the city of Zurich to go pursue a business career in Paris. Due to the work of Jean- Conrad, the name Hottinger appeared under the heading of ‚ÄúBankers‚Äù in the Almanach Royal de France in 1784. During the turbulent years of the French Revolution, banking and trade associations were closed down to be reborn later on under the Directoire. Hottinguer left France during this troublesome period and traveled around Europe and America, he met his future wife Martha Redwood in London, the grand daughter of the founder of the Redwood Library and Athenaeum in Newport and married her on 24 August 1793. During this time, he made an array of contacts, and set up a useful business network around the world. This resulted in a number of fruitful commercial and business relationships, including the Bishop of Autun, Charles Maurice de Talleyrand- P√©rigord. After many years of traveling, Hottinguer finally returned to France in 1796 to continue working as French banker. Business recommenced at Hottinger & Cie in Paris once the Revolution ended. The French economy was once again able to function properly when banking and trading had resumed. Hottinger & Cie became intimately involved in financial and trade industries in France, Switzerland and many other areas of the world thanks to the work of Hottinguer. In the late 18th century, Hottinguer was one of the French agents involved in the XYZ Affair, a much-publicized diplomatic scandal between France and the United States. In the beginning 19th century, a family friend and associate, Henri Escher, established the first Hottinger representative office in America. His son, Alfred Escher, founded Credit Suisse, the √âcole Polytechnique of Zurich, and Gotthard Rail Company before being made President of the national council. For his achievements, the city for Z√ºrich recognizes him with a statue. In 1803, Hottinguer was appointed as a founding member of The Board of Governors for The Banque de France. He then went on to become a member of the general Council of trade and then president of the Paris Chamber of Commerce and Industry. On 19 September 1810 he was made a Baron of the French Empire. This hereditary title would pass to the oldest son of each generation. Hottinger later became interested in the insurance industry. In the first year that the insurance industry was open to bankers, he created the first Compagnie Royale D\`Assurances.

The earliest elpistostegalians, combining fishlike and tetrapod-like characters, are sometimes called fishapods, a phrase coined for the advanced elpistostegalian Tiktaalik. Through a strict cladistic view, the order includes the terrestrial tetrapods. Palaeobiology of the elpistostegalians A rise in global oxygen content allowed for the evolution of large, predatory fish that were able to exploit the shallow tidal areas and swamplands as top predators. Several groups evolved to fill these niches, the most successful were the elpistiostegalians. In such environments, they would have been challenged by periodic oxygen deficiency. In comparable modern aquatic environments like shallow eutrophic lakes and swampland, modern lungfish and some genera of catfish also rely on the more stable, atmospheric source of oxygen. Being shallow-water fishes, the elpistostegalians evolved many of the basic adaptions that later allowed the tetrapods to become terrestrial animals. The most important ones were the shift of main propulsion apparatus from the tail fin to the pectoral and pelvic fins, and a shift to reliance on lungs rather than gills as the main means of obtaining oxygen. Both of these appear to be a direct result of moving to an inland freshwater mode of living. The elpistostegalians gave rise to the tetrapods in the Eifelian (early middle Devonian) around 395 million years ago. While the early tetrapods flourished and diversified over the next 30 million years, the non- tetrapod elpistostegalians disappear from the fossil record fairly quickly in the early Frasnian around 380 million years ago, leaving the tetrapods the sole survivors of their line. Traits Paleontologist and professor Per E. Ahlberg has identified the following traits as synapomorphic for Elpistostegalia (and thus Tetrapoda): * The endocranium is hinged, the hinge forming the profundus nerve foramen. The cranial kinesis is also visible in the skull roof, between the parietal bones and the postparietal bones. * A rather small shoulder girdle is present. * The anal and posterior dorsal fin supported by a basal plate and three unjointed radials. * The pectoral fin skeleton is composed of bones homologous to the tetrapod humerus, ulna, and radius, followed by a host of smaller bones anchoring the fin rays; the pelvic fin skeleton similarly has femur, tibia, and fibula. Phylogeny The name, originally coined around the genus Elpistostege, later become a synonym for Panderichthyida. In most analyses, the group as traditionally imagined is actually an evolutionary grade, the last \\"fishes\\" of the tetrapod stem line, though Chang and Yu (1997) treated them as the sister clade to Tetrapoda. Elpistostegalia was re-defined as a clade containing Panderichthys and tetrapods. Below is a cladogram from Swartz, 2012.

Known by its manufacturer AB Landsverk as Lago II-III-IV, it fielded a 75 mm L/31 gun, the first of its size in a Swedish tank. It entered service with the Swedish army in April 1943. Modern in design, it was also well protected and mobile. A total of 282 were produced. As a neutral nation in World War II, Sweden did not engage in combat; thus its tanks have no battlefield record.  Design history  The Strv m/42 had its origins on modifications in the Lago (the manufacturer designation) a light tank armed with a 37 mm cannon and three machine guns produced for the Hungarian Army in late 1930s by the AB Landsverk, itself a development of the Stridsvagn L-60 light tank also made by the AB Landsverk. The Swedish Army specified for a bigger and better tank than the Lago resulting in the Strv m/42 (later known as Strv m/42 TM), a tank armed with a 75mm L/31 gun, suited against armored and soft vehicles. The gearbox of the m/42 TM was not working well and these tanks were rebuilt either as m/42 TH, or they got a new mechanical gearbox and became known m/42 TV.  Production history  In November 1941 100 Strv m/42s were ordered. All the vehicles had an electromagnetic gearbox. (Strv m/42 TM, the T meaning two engines and the M meaning electromagnetic gearbox). In January 1942 another 60 Strv m/42s were ordered. This batch were built under license by Volvo, the first 55 vehicles were fitted with twin Scania-Vabis L/603 engines and the remaining five were equipped with a new engine, the Volvo A8B. All the vehicles had the first batch electromagnetic gearbox replaced by a new hydraulic gearbox, with all these modifications, the single- engine vehicles were now designated as Strv m/42 EH, (the E meaning one engine and the H meaning hydraulic gearbox), the dual-engines tanks but with the new transmission were designated as Strv m/42 TH. In June 1942 another 80 were ordered from Landsverk, they were 70 m/42 TH and 10 m/42 EH. Between April 1943 to January 1945, 282 Strv m/42s were delivered, of which 180 tanks were made in Landsverk, 102 at Volvo. Most of the vehicles, 225 pieces, were fitted with Scania engines. The other 57 tanks got Volvo engines. All of the 225 Strv m/42 TH and m/42 TV produced (all strv m/42 with twin Scania-Vabis L/603 engines), were rebuilt between 1957 and 1960 to Stridsvagn 74 tanks and the EH vehicles (strv m/42 with single Volvo engine A8B engines) to Infanterikanonvagn 73 infantry support vehicles. The turrets were reused as static gun pillboxes, along the major coastlines, but mostly defending harbours and more seldom airfields. Variants Strv m/42 was originally ordered in four versions in three configurations: * Strv m/42 TM (Lago II) had two Scania-Vabis L/603 engines and a ZF electromagnetic gearbox. Made in 1943-44. * Strv m/42 TH (Lago III), had two Scania-Vabis L/603 engines, each with an Atlas Diesel hydraulic gearbox. Made in 1944. * Strv m/42 EH (Lago IV) had a single Volvo A8B engine and an Atlas Diesel hydraulic gearbox. Made in 1944-45. * Strv m/42 TV had two Scania-Vabis L/603 engines with a Volvo mechanical gearbox. Made in 1948.  Service  The Strv m/42 was issued to the following armored regiments: * P 1/Enk√∂ping - Gotland stridsvagnskompani (), * P 2/Helsingborg, * P 3/Str√§ngn√§s, * P 4/Sk√∂vde: where the tanks were included in the newly formed tank companies. The Strv m/42s were employed in the heavy tank companies of the armored brigades. They were phased out of active service in the 1950s and replaced by the Stridsvagn 81.

About 5,000 soldiers were massacred and others drowned. Following the decision of the Italian government to negotiate a surrender to the Allies in 1943, the German Army tried to disarm the Italians during Operation Achse. On 13 September the Italians of the 33rd Acqui Infantry Division resisted, and fought the Germans on the island of Cephalonia. By 22 September the last of the Italian resistance surrendered after running out of ammunition. A total of 1,315 Italians were killed in the battle, 5,155 were executed by 26 September, and 3,000 were drowned when the German ships taking the survivors to concentration camps were sunk by the Allies. It was one of the largest prisoner of war massacres of the war, along with the Katyn massacre, and it was one of many atrocities committed by the 1st Mountain Division (). History Background General , commander of the Acqui Division Since the fall of Greece in April‚ÄìMay 1941, the country had been divided in occupation zones, with the Italians getting the bulk of the mainland and most islands. The Acqui Division had been the Italian garrison of Cephalonia since May 1943, and consisted of 11,500 soldiers and 525 officers. It was composed of two infantry regiments (the 17th and the 317th), the 33rd artillery regiment, the 27th Blackshirt Legion, the 19th Blackshirt Battalion and support units. Furthermore, its 18th Regiment was detached to garrison duties in Corfu. Acqui also had naval coastal batteries, torpedo boats and two aircraft. From 18 June 1943, it was commanded by the 52-year-old General Antonio Gandin, a decorated veteran of the Russian Front where he earned the German Iron Cross. The Germans decided to reinforce their presence throughout the Balkans, following Allied successes and the possibility that Italy might seek accommodation with the Allies. On 5‚Äì6 July Lt Colonel Johannes Barge arrived with 2,000 men of the 966th Fortress Grenadier Regiment, including Fortress-Battalions 810 and 909 and a battery of self-propelled guns and nine tanks. After Italy's armistice with the Allies in September 1943, General Gandin found himself in a dilemma: one option was surrendering to the Germans ‚Äì who were already prepared for the eventuality and had begun disarming Italian garrisons elsewhere ‚Äì or trying to resist. Initially, Gandin requested instructions from his superiors and began negotiations with Barge. Translation by Google On 8 September 1943, the day the armistice was made public, General , commander of the 170,000-strong Italian army occupying Greece, telegrammed Gandin his order, essentially a copy of General Ambrosio's promemoria 2 from Headquarters. Vecchiarelli's order instructed that if the Germans did not attack the Italians, the Italians should not attack the Germans. Ambrosio's order stated that the Italians should not \\"make common cause\\" with the Greek partisans or even the Allies, should they arrive in Cephalonia. Comments: (\\"common cause\\", Ambrosio's tactics and Badoglio's paradox on page 423) (Corfu info and poll on bottom of page 424) (no match reference, Hitler's orders, \\"delirium of omnipotence\\" and Austrian origin on page 425) (Refusal to bury dead on page 427) In the case of a German attack, Vecchiarelli's order was not very specific because it was based on General Pietro Badoglio's directive which stated that the Italians should respond with \\"maximum decision\\" to any threat from any side. The order implied that the Italians should defend themselves but did not explicitly state so. At 22:30 hours of the same day Gandin received an order directly from General Ambrosio to send most of his naval and merchant vessels to Brindisi immediately, as demanded by the terms of the armistice. Gandin complied, thus losing a possible means of escape. To make matters even more complicated Badoglio had agreed, after the overthrow of Mussolini, to the unification of the two armies under German command, in order to appease the Germans. Therefore, technically, both Vecchiarelli and Gandin were under German command, even though Italy had implemented an armistice agreement with the Allies. That gave the Germans a sense of justification in treating any Italians disobeying their orders as mutineers or franc-tireurs, which, at that time, the laws of war considered unlawful combatants subject to execution on capture. At 9:00 hours on 9 September, Barge met with Gandin and misled him by stating that he had received no orders from the German command. The two men liked each other and they had things in common as Gandin was pro-German and liked Goethe. Indeed, Gandin's pro-German attitude was the reason he had been sent by General Ambrosio to command the Acqui Division: fearing he might side with the Germans against the evolving plot to depose Mussolini, Ambrosio wanted Gandin out of Italy. Both men ended their meeting on good terms, agreeing to wait for orders and also that the situation should be resolved peacefully. On 11 September, the Italian High Command sent two explicit instructions to Gandin, to the effect that \\"German troops have to be viewed as hostile\\" and that \\"disarmament attempts by German forces must be resisted with weapons\\". That same day Barge handed Gandin an ultimatum, demanding a decision given the following three options: > #Continue fighting on the German side #Fight against the Germans #Hand over > arms peacefully Gandin brought Barge's ultimatum to his senior officers and the seven chaplains of the Acqui for discussion. Six of the chaplains and all of his senior officers advised him to comply with the German demands while one of the chaplains suggested immediate surrender. However, Gandin could not agree to join the Germans because that would be against the King's orders as relayed by Badoglio. He also did not want to fight them because, as he said, \\"they had fought with us and for us, side by side\\". On the other hand, surrendering the weapons would violate the spirit of the armistice. Despite the orders from the Italian GHQ, Gandin chose to continue negotiating with Barge. Barge's telegram to his superiors, reporting Gandin's decision to hand over only heavy weaponry, and the German troops' readiness to attack Gandin finally agreed to withdraw his soldiers from their strategic location on Mount Kardakata, the island's \\"nerve centre\\", in return for a German promise not to bring reinforcements from the Greek mainland and on 12 September, he informed Barge that he was prepared to surrender the Acqui's weapons, as Lt Colonel Barge reported to his superiors in the XXII Mountain Corps. However, Gandin was under pressure not to come to an agreement with the Germans from his junior officers who were threatening mutiny. The Acqui's detached regiment on Corfu, not commanded by Gandin, also informed him at around midnight 12‚Äì13 September, by radio communication, that they had rejected an agreement with the Germans. Gandin also heard from credible sources that soldiers who had surrendered were being deported and not repatriated. On 13 September, a German convoy of five ships approached the island's capital, Argostoli. Italian artillery officers, on their own initiative, ordered the remaining batteries to open fire, sinking two German landing craft and killing five Germans. Under these circumstances, that same night, Gandin presented his troops with a poll, essentially containing the three options presented to him by Barge: > #Join the Germans #Surrender and be repatriated #Resist the German forces The response from the Italian troops was in favour of the third option by a large majority but there is no available information as to the exact size of the majority, and therefore on 14 September Gandin reneged on the agreement, refusing to surrender anything but the division's heavy artillery and telling the Germans to leave the island, demanding a reply by 9:00 the next day. Battle with the Germans As the negotiations stalled, the Germans prepared to resolve the crisis by force and presented the Italians with an ultimatum which expired at 14:00 hours on 15 September. On the morning of 15 September, the German Luftwaffe began bombarding the Italian positions with Stuka dive-bombers. On the ground, the Italians initially enjoyed superiority, and took about 400 Germans prisoner. On 17 September however, the Germans landed the \\"Battle Group Hirschfeld\\", composed of the III./98 and the 54th Mountain Battalions of the German Army's elite 1st Mountain Division, together with I./724 Battalion of the 104th J√§ger Division, under the command of Major Harald von Hirschfeld. The 98th Gebirgsj√§ger Regiment, in particular, had been involved in several atrocities against civilians in Epirus in the months preceding the Acqui massacre.Meyer, Hermann Frank: Die 1. Gebirgs-Division in Epirus im Sommer 1943, hfmeyer.com; accessed 6 December 2014. At the same time, the Germans started dropping propaganda leaflets calling upon the Italians to surrender. The leaflets stated: > \\"Italian comrades, soldiers and officers, why fight against the Germans? You > have been betrayed by your leaders!... LAY DOWN YOUR ARMS!! THE ROAD BACK TO > YOUR HOMELAND WILL BE OPENED UP FOR YOU BY YOUR GERMAN COMRADES\\". Gandin repeatedly requested help from the Ministry of War in Brindisi, but he did not get any reply. He even went so far as sending a Red Cross emissary to the Ministry, but the mission broke down off the coast of Apulia and when it arrived three days later at the Italian High Command in Brindisi, it was already too late. In addition, 300 planes loyal to Badoglio were located at Lecce, near the southernmost point of Italy, well within range of Cephalonia, and were ready to intervene. But the Allies would not let them go because they feared they could have defected to the German side. Furthermore, two Italian torpedo boats, already on their way to Cephalonia, were ordered back to port by the Allies for the same reasons. Despite help for the Italians from the local population, including the island's small ELAS partisan detachments, the Germans enjoyed complete air superiority and their troops had extensive combat experience, in contrast with the conscripts of Acqui, who were no match for the Germans. In addition, Gandin had withdrawn the Acqui from the elevated position on Mount Kardakata and that gave the Germans an additional strategic advantage. After several days of fighting, at 11:00 hours on 22 September, following Gandin's orders, the last Italians surrendered, having run out of ammunition and having lost 1,315 men killed. According to German sources, the losses were 300 Germans and 1,200 Italians. 15 Greek partisans were also killed fighting alongside the Acqui. Massacre Major Harald von Hirschfeld, commander of the Gebirgsj√§ger troops on Cephalonia. The massacre started on 21 September, and lasted for one week. After the Italian surrender, Hitler had issued an order allowing the Germans to summarily execute any Italian officer who resisted \\"for treason\\", and on 18 September, the German High Command issued an order stating that \\"because of the perfidious and treacherous behaviour [of the Italians] on Cephalonia, no prisoners are to be taken.\\" Google translation The Gebirgsj√§ger soldiers began executing their Italian prisoners in groups of four to ten. The Germans first killed the surrendering Italians, where they stood, using machine-guns. When a group of Bavarian soldiers objected to this practice they were threatened with summary execution themselves. After this stage was over, the Germans marched the remaining soldiers to the San Teodoro town hall and had the prisoners executed by eight member detachments. General Gandin and 137 of his senior officers were summarily court-martialled on 24 September and executed, their bodies discarded at sea. Padre Romualdo Formato, one of the seven chaplains of the Acqui Division. Romualdo Formato, one of Acqui's seven chaplains and one of the few survivors, wrote that during the massacre, the Italian officers started to cry, pray and sing. Many were shouting the names of their mothers, wives and children. According to Formato's account, three officers hugged and stated that they were comrades while alive and now in death they would go together to paradise, while others were digging through the grass as if trying to escape. In one place, Formato recalled, \\"the Germans went around loudly offering medical help to those wounded. When about 20 men crawled forward, a machine-gun salvo finished them off.\\" Officers gave Formato their belongings to take with him and give to their families back in Italy. The Germans, however, confiscated the items and Formato could no longer account for the exact number of the officers killed. The executions of the Italian officers were continuing when a German officer came and reprieved Italians who could prove they were from South Tyrol as that region had been annexed by Hitler as German province after 8 September. Seeing an opportunity, Formato begged the officer to stop the killings and save the few officers remaining. The German officer responded and told Formato that he would consult with his commanding officer.Recount of the Acqui massacre, spiegel.de; accessed 6 September 2014. When the officer returned, after half an hour, he informed Formato that the killings of the officers would stop. The number of Italian surviving officers, including Formato, totaled 37. After the reprieve the Germans congratulated the remaining Italians and offered them cigarettes. The situation remained unstable, however. Following the reprieve, the Germans forced twenty Italian sailors to load the bodies of the dead officers on rafts and take them out to sea. The Germans then blew up the rafts with the Italian sailors on board. Alfred Richter, an Austrian and one of the participants in the massacre, recounted how a soldier who sang arias for the Germans in the local taverns was forced to sing while his comrades were being executed. The singing soldier's fate remains unknown. Richter stated that he and his regiment comrades felt \\"a delirium of omnipotence\\" during the events. Most of the soldiers of the German regiment were Austrians. According to Richter the Italian soldiers were killed after surrendering to the soldiers of the 98th Regiment. He described that the bodies were then thrown into heaps, all shot in the head. Soldiers of the 98th Regiment started removing the boots from the corpses for their own use. Richter mentioned that groups of Italians were taken into quarries and walled gardens near the village of Frangata and executed by machine gun fire. The killing lasted for two hours, during which time the sound of the shooting and the screams of the victims could be heard inside the homes of the village.\\"Nazi massacre on island idyll\\", BBC.co.uk, 26 March 2001; accessed 6 December 2014. The bodies of the ca. 5,000 men who were executed were disposed of in a variety of ways. Bodies were cremated in massive wood pyres, which made the air of the island thick with the smell of burning flesh, or moved to ships where they were buried at sea. (Mentions the fires)Google translation. Others, according to Amos Pampaloni, one of the survivors, were executed in full sight of the Greek population in Argostoli harbour on 23 September 1943 and their bodies were left to rot where they fell, while in smaller streets corpses were decomposing and the stench was insufferable to the point that he could not remain there long enough to take a picture of the carnage. The Guardian UK Quote: \\"In an entry dated 23 September 1943, Corporal Richter registers the execution of Italian soldiers in Argostoli harbour, in full sight of Greek civilians and with the bodies left to rot in the autumn heat. 'In one of the small streets the smell is so bad that I can't even take a picture', he reports.\\" Bodies were thrown into the sea, with rocks tied around them. In addition, the Germans had refused to allow the Acqui soldiers to bury their dead. A chaplain set out to find bodies, discovering bones scattered all over. The few soldiers who were saved were assisted by locals and the ELAS organisation. One of the survivors was taken heavily wounded to a Cephalonian lady's home by a taxi driver and survived the war to live in Lake Como. An additional three thousand of the survivors in German custody drowned, when the ships Sinfra, Mario Roselli and Ardena, transporting them to concentration camps, were sunk by Allied air raids and sea mines in the Adriatic. These losses and similar ones from the Italian Dodecanese garrisons were also the result of German policy, as Hitler had instructed the local German commanders to forgo \\"all safety precautions\\" during the transport of prisoners, \\"regardless of losses\\". In a book review published by Corriere della Sera, other estimates of the Italian soldiers massacred at Cephalonia range between 1,650‚Äì3,800. Aftermath Italian soldiers taken prisoner by the Germans in Corfu, September 1943. The events in Cephalonia were repeated, to a lesser extent, elsewhere. In Corfu, the 8,000-strong Italian garrison comprised elements of three divisions, including the Acqui's 18th Regiment. On 24 September, the Germans landed a force on the island (characteristically codenamed \\"Operation Treason\\"), and by the next day they were able to induce the Italians to capitulate. All 280 Italian officers on the island were executed during the next two days on the orders of General Lanz, in accordance with Hitler's directives. The bodies were loaded onto a ship and disposed of in the sea. Similar executions of officers also occurred in the aftermath of the Battle of Kos, where between 96 and 103 Italian officers were shot along with their commander.Massacres and Atrocities of WWII, members.iinet.net.au; accessed 6 December 2014. In October 1943, after Mussolini had been freed and established his new Fascist Republic in Northern Italy, the Germans gave the remaining Italian prisoners three choices: > #Continue fighting on the German side #Forced labour on the island > #Concentration camps in Germany Most Italians opted for the second choice. In January 1944, a chaplain's account reached Benito Mussolini after Aurelio Garobbio, a Swiss Fascist from the Italian-speaking Canton of Ticino, informed him about the events. Mussolini became incensed that the Germans would do such a thing, although he considered the Acqui division's officers, more so than its soldiers, as traitors. Nevertheless, in one of his exchanges with Garobbio, after Garobbio complained that the Germans showed no mercy, he said: \\"But our men defended themselves, you know. They hit several German landing craft sinking them. They fought how Italians know how to fight\\". Prosecution General Lanz, commander of the XXII Mountain Corps, at the Nuremberg Trials. To date he is the only person to have served a prison sentence for the events in Cephalonia. Major Harald von Hirschfeld was never tried for his role in the massacre: in December 1944, he became the Wehrmacht's youngest general officer, and was killed while fighting at the Dukla Pass in Poland in 1945. Only Hirschfeld's superior commander, General Hubert Lanz, was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment at the so-called \\"Southeast Case\\" of the Nuremberg Trials for the Cephalonia massacre, as well as the participation of his men in other atrocities in Greece like the massacre of Kommeno on 16 August 1943. He was released in 1951 and died in 1982. Lt Colonel Barge was not on the island when the massacre was taking place. He was subsequently decorated with the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross for his service in Crete. He died in 2000. The reason for Lanz's light sentence was that the court at Nuremberg was deceived by false evidence and did not believe that the massacre took place, despite a book about the massacre by padre Formato published in 1946, a year before the trial. Because there was doubt as to who issued what order, Lanz was only charged with the deaths of Gandin and the officers. Lanz lied in court by stating he had refused to obey Hitler's orders to shoot the prisoners because he was revolted by them. He claimed that the report to Army Group E, claiming 5,000 soldiers were shot, was a ruse employed to deceive the army command in order to hide the fact that he had disobeyed the F√ºhrer's orders. He added that fewer than a dozen officers were shot and the rest of the Acqui Division was transported to Piraeus through Patras. In his testimony, Lanz was assisted by affidavits from other Germans such as General von Butlar from Hitler's personal staff, who was involved in the Ardeatine massacre. The Germans were with Lanz in September 1943 and swore that the massacre had never taken place. In addition, for reasons unknown, the Italian side never presented any evidence for the massacre at the Nuremberg trials. It is speculated that the Italians, reeling from armistice terms highly unfavourable for their country, refused to cooperate with the trial process. Given the circumstances the court accepted Lanz's position that he prevented the massacre and that the event never happened. Consequently, Lanz received a lighter sentence than General Rendulic for his misdeed in Yugoslavia, who was released in late 1951 nevertheless, after only three years of imprisonment. Lanz's defence emphasised that the prosecution had not presented any Italian evidence for the massacre and claimed that there was no evidence the Italian headquarters in Brindisi had ever instructed Gandin and his Division to fight. Therefore, according to the logic of the defence, Gandin and his men were either mutineers or franc-tireurs and did not qualify for POW status under the Geneva conventions. The Germans justified their behaviour by claiming the Italians were negotiating the surrender of the island to the British. The German claim was not entirely unfounded: in the Greek mainland, an entire division went over to the Greek guerrillas, and in the Dodecanese, the Italians had joined forces with the British, resulting in a two-month German campaign to evict them. An attempt to revisit the case by the Dortmund state prosecutor Johannes Obluda in 1964 came to naught, as the political climate in Germany at the time was in favour of \\"putting the war behind\\". In 2002 Dortmund prosecutor Ultrich Maaos reopened a case against certain persons responsible for the massacre. In his office, along with a map of the world, Maaos displayed a map of Cephalonia with the dates and locations of the executions as well as the names of the victims. No indictments or arrests resulted from Maaos' investigation. Ten ex- members of the 1st Gebirgs Division have been investigated, out of 300 still alive. Commemoration The Italian President Giorgio Napolitano in Cephalonia during remembrance ceremonies in honour of the soldiers of the 33rd Division Acqui In the 1950s, the remains of about 3,000 soldiers, including 189 officers, were exhumed and transported back to Italy for burial in the Italian War Cemetery in Bari. The remains of General Gandin were never identified. The subject of the massacre was largely ignored in Italy by the press and the educational system until 1980, when the Italian President Sandro Pertini, a former partisan, unveiled the memorial in Cephalonia. The massacre provided the historical background to the 1994 novel Captain Corelli's Mandolin. Despite the recognition of the event by Pertini, it was not until March 2001 that another Italian President, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, visited the memorial again, and even then he was most likely influenced by the publicity generated by the impending release of the Hollywood film Captain Corelli's Mandolin, based on the novel with the same name. Thanks to these actions today a large number of streets in Italy are named after \\"Divisione Acqui\\". During the ceremony Ciampi, referring to the men of the Acqui Division, declared that their \\"conscious decision was the first act of resistance by an Italy freed from fascism\\" and that \\"they preferred to fight and die for their fatherland\\". The massacre of the Acqui Division is emerging as a subject of ongoing research, and is regarded as a leading example of the Italian Resistance during World War II.Rossi, Elena Aga and Agarossi, Elena. In 2002 the Italian post issued the commemorative stamp Eccidio della Divisione Aqui. The Presidents of Greece and Italy periodically commemorate the event during ceremonies taking place in Cephalonia at the monument of the Acqui Division. An academic conference about the massacre was held on 2‚Äì3 March 2007 in Parma, Italy. Cephalonia's Greco-Italian Society maintains an exhibition called \\"The Mediterraneo Exhibition\\", next to the Catholic church in Argostoli, where pictures, newspaper articles and documents showcasing the story of the massacre are displayed.Gill, John and Edwards, Nick.

When Monash Province was abolished in 2006, he was successful in winning one of the five seats in the newly created Eastern Victoria Region of the Legislative Council. Johan Scheffer joined the Australian Labor Party (ALP) in 1991 and shortly after joined its Socialist Left faction. He was active in the Victorian Branch, holding positions of Local FEA (Federal Electorate Assembly) Secretary and State Conference Delegate for the Federal electorate of Melbourne Ports (renamed Macnamara in 2019). He was elected to the party‚Äôs State Administrative Committee and to the Agenda Committee (1996-2009), playing a key role in reorganising the policy development process through the active participation of the party‚Äôs rank and file, factional groups, affiliated unions, the Parliamentary wing and adoption by State Conference. Johan Scheffer joined with other like-minded party members in efforts to stamp out branch stacking that had become rife, especially in electorates winnable for Labor. He was an active campaigner in exposing breaches of Party rules and bringing complaints to the Party‚Äôs Disputes Tribunal. In 1993 Johan Scheffer joined the staff of the Federal Member for Melbourne Ports, Hon Clyde Holding MHR, until Holding‚Äôs retirement in 1998, when Scheffer joined the staff of Victorian MP, Hon Barry Pullen MLC in the then seat of Melbourne Province. Pullen did not contest the 1999 Victorian election, making way for Gavin Jennings, who was elected to represent the seat in 1999 as part of the new Labor Government lead by Steve Bracks. Johan Scheffer was appointed an adviser to Jennings, in his role as Cabinet Secretary (1999-2002). In 2002, Johan Scheffer nominated for the seat of Monash Province in the Victorian Legislative Council. After a bitter pre- selection battle, he won the nomination and was elected to the Council in the Victorian State election of 30 November 2002. During his 12 years in the Parliament, Johan Scheffer focussed on promoting community understanding of Labor‚Äôs program. He pushed for reforms that would address global warming and protect the environment; strengthen industrial rights and worker conditions; advance the development of environmentally sustainable urban planning; reduce gender inequality; eliminate family violence; enhance LGBT rights and understanding; protect women‚Äôs reproductive rights; build cohesive local communities including harmonious ethnic and religious groups. Scheffer lead the campaign to lay underground power lines from the Latrobe Valley to the Victorian Desalination Plant to protect farming in South Gippsland. He advocated for major and long-term investment in the Latrobe Valley to protect livelihoods after the inevitable decommissioning of the Valley's coal mines. Johan Scheffer chaired a number of Joint Investigatory Committees of the Parliament, including the Drugs and Crime Prevention Committee, the Family and Community Services Committee and the Law Reform Committee. He also served on the Economic Development, Infrastructure and Outer Suburban/Interface Services and Education Committees. Early Life Johan Scheffer was born in Batavia (Jakarta) in the Dutch East Indies (Indonesia) on 7 February 1948 to Cornelis Scheffer and Aleida Charlotte Maria Eugenie Scheffer-Verwey. His family on both sides had lived in Indonesia since the middle of the nineteenth century. On his mother‚Äôs side, his antecedents are of mixed Javanese and European background, whereas on his father‚Äôs side they are of Dutch origin. Johan Scheffer‚Äôs early immersion in Indonesian and Dutch cultures, as well as his dual nationality has given him an international outlook and a suspicion of nationalism. Johan Scheffer‚Äôs early years were spent in Indonesia and the Netherlands. After settling in The Hague in 1949, the family departed from the Netherlands in 1952 for Australia, intending to move from there to Malaya. Aleida and Cornelis were people of strong political opinions, engaged in the cross currents of their historical moment, especially the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies and their support of independence from Dutch colonialism. The adversities his parents experienced as immigrants in Australia influenced Scheffer's understanding of immigration, ethnicity and class struggle. He attended Gardenvale Infant School, St Kilda Primary School and Elwood High School, matriculating in 1966. He enrolled for a Bachelor of Arts degree at Monash University, majoring in literature. During his time at university he was active in student politics and participated in a number of campaigns, including the resistance and mobilisation against Australian and US involvement in the Vietnam War. His university studies of literature, philosophy, classical civilisation, history and politics introduced Scheffer to cultural studies, the history of ideas and the struggle for political emancipation, and to Marxism and the socialist tradition, which shaped his understanding of history and class struggle. Career Johan Scheffer completed his teacher training at the University of Melbourne in 1972 and taught history and geography at Bourke Hall, the Junior School of Xavier College, in 1973. In 1974 and 1975 he taught English literature at the De La Salle College, Malvern. He taught politics, literature, history and English at University High School from 1976 until 1984 and was an activist member of the Victorian Secondary Teachers Association (VSTA). By the late 1970s Scheffer had joined the Australian Communist Party (CPA). Johan Scheffer was a program consultant in the Australian Schools Commission‚Äôs Disadvantaged Schools Program (1984-1988) and for a time, a member of the Program‚Äôs Ministerial Advisory Committee. He worked in the inner city suburbs of Flemington, North Melbourne, Carlton and Fitzroy and was active in local government issues in the City of Melbourne. In 1988 he was appointed State Manager of the Out of Schools Hours Child Care Program that was located in the Women‚Äôs Employment Branch within the Victorian Department of Labour. This program was a Victorian Government strategy to support the Keating Government‚Äôs efforts to facilitate women‚Äôs career and employment opportunities.

Early life Jean Baptiste Baudreau Dit Graveline II was born in the 1710s (presumably 1715) on the French Louisiana settlement of Massacre Island (modern day Dauphin Island, Alabama). He was the son of Sieur Jean Baptiste Baudreau Dit Graveline, the captain of the Pascagoula militia (and the first settler of Pascagoula, Mississippi, and one of the original settlers of the old Mobile), and an Indian woman named Suzanne. Having originally been born as an illegitimate child, his father married the Indian woman in 1727 in an attempt to legitimize him. In 1734, Baudreau married Marie Catherine Viconneau, a Protestant, with whom he would have all of his legitimate children. Illegitimate Children In the 1740s, he began having an affair with a girl named Marie Henriette Huet, whose family owned a plantation in the area around modern day Portersville Bay. He had two illegitimate children with her, the majority of whom would use the surname of Baptiste (in modern-day Mobile, this has evolved into Battiste). One of these children is regarded by modern historians to be the founder of Coq'd'Inde (Coden, Alabama). Conflicts with the French Authorities and Execution in New Orleans During the course of his life, he had problems with French authorities and was subject to imprisonment several times. Despite his warm relations with Bienville, he was regarded with suspicion by some French authorities, because of his unique relationship with the local Native American population, due in large part because of his half Indian heritage. At the same time however, he was a vital part of the French colonial operation, as he was often the one who was sent on trading excursions into Creek territory. In the 1740s, he had been imprisoned by French authorities on kidnapping charges related to an excursion he took to Havana, Cuba. He broke out of prison and took refuge in Native American villages north of Mobile. The Native Americans refused to engage in any further trade with the French until he was pardoned. Governor Vandrieul petitioned for King Louis XV to drop the charges, which he did. In the 1750s, Baudreau was imprisoned at the French prison on modern day Cat Island, Mississippi for charges of illegal salvaging wrecked ships. In 1757 soldiers stationed at the prison staged a mutiny and killed the commanding officer. They took Graveline hostage and forced him to be their guide as they went into the hinterlands away from the colony. The mutineers provided Baudreau with a signed certificate saying he had not been a party to the mutiny. Despite this, Governor Kerlerec had him court martialed and he was sentenced to death. He was executed by breaking wheel in front of the St. Louis Cathedral in New Orleans, Louisiana on June 7, 1757. The French authorities subsequently mutilated what were left of his remains and deposited them in the Mississippi River. A movement is currently ongoing by some of his descendants to get the City of New Orleans to erect a marker in Jackson Square commemorating his life and brutal execution at that site. Relations with his father In 1747, while he was on the run from French authorities following his prison escape, the mother of his illegitimate children, Marie Henriette Huet, filed a claim with the French authorities for support of her children. The senior Graveline, the grandfather of the children, agreed to help provide for their support. In 1763, when his father died, he disowned his son in his will, stating that he had married his mother only to legitimize him, and then proceeded to list a number of reasons justifying the disinheritance. Impact on Gulf Coast culture and life Graveline Bay, which borders southern Mississippi and southern Alabama, is named for his father. Urbain Baudreau Dit Graveline Park in Montreal, Quebec was named for his grandfather, who was an important figure in the history of Quebec. Baudreau was the 6th great- grandfather of singer/songwriter Jimmy Buffett, the 6th great-grandfather of actress Diane Ladd, 7th great-grandfather of actress Laura Dern, and the 5th great-grandfather of Mobile, Alabama cook, socialite and television personality Connie Bea Hope. His 3rd great-grandson, Charles Clements, was one of the Confederate soldiers executed by Union authorities at Ship Island, Mississippi. Baudreau's affair with Marie Henriette Huet served as the basis for the book \\"The Passion of the Princes\\" by author Eloise Genest. A movement is currently underway to get the city of New Orleans to erect a historical marker in Jackson Square commemorating his life and grisly death. Advocates of the march held a rally in New Orleans in 2007.

Snyder's Drug Stores, Inc., 414 U.S. 156 (1973), held that a state statute, under which Snyder's had been denied a pharmacy operating permit because it was not majority owned by pharmacists, did not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.. The court overruled the decision of the North Dakota Supreme Court, which relied on the 1928 decision in Liggett Co. v. Baldridge. to hold the statute unconstitutional. The questions which were raised by the case were: (1) Does the U.S. Supreme Court have jurisdiction to decide the case, e.g. is it final; (2) was the statute in question constitutional. The Supreme Court answered both questions in the affirmative. With respect to point (1), the State Board of Pharmacy, being a state agency, is bound by the decisions of the State Supreme Court. Absent an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, it has to abide by what its State's Supreme Court says regarding the constitutionality of a state law. While the State Supreme Court had remanded the case back to the Pharmacy Board for further proceedings, this did not mean the case was nonappealable. State law allows any party aggrieved by the decision to appeal it in court. Problem is, the board itself is not a party to the decision, but is the tribunal making the decision. Thus, under the law of its state, the Board's only options to be able to raise the constitutional question are either to defy its own state's Supreme Court and refuse to grant the license, thus causing Respondent Snyder's to go back into court again, or for the Board to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. Thus, since the Board really had nowhere to go to get relief, the U.S. Supreme Court does have standing to hear the case. With respect to point (2), the case in Liggett regarded a state law that required 100% ownership by pharmacists. The law in this case required a licensee wanting to operate a pharmacy be either a pharmacist or a corporation where the majority of the stockholders were pharmacists. The owner of Snyder's Drug Stores was Red Owl, a supermarket chain, and it was not shown if the majority of the stockholders of Red Owl were pharmacists. It was a decision regarding substantive due process. However, the court's reasoning on substantive due process was not completely clear and not all of the justices agreed on how to decide the cases. As the point in requiring a pharmacy to be majority owned by pharmacists was to provide a higher degree of care and concern over the operation of a pharmacy, the court found the statute to be a constitutional use of legislative power which \\"bears a real and substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, or some other phase of the general welfare,\\" See also * List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 418 References External links * United States administrative case law United States Supreme Court cases 1973 in United States case law United States substantive due process case law 1973 in North Dakota Legal history of North Dakota United States Supreme Court cases of the Burger Court ","title":"North Dakota State Board of Pharmacy v.

It has one of a trio of port lighthouses at the end of its extension breakwater, and a famous statue of Realt na Mara (Mary, Queen of the Sea) partway along, and was responsible for the formation of North Bull Island with its nearly 5 km of beach. History Background Dublin Bay had a long-running problem with silting, notably at the mouth of the River Liffey, and held major sand banks, notably the North Bull and South Bull, to either side of the Liffey mouth, along with the Kish Bank over 11 km out to sea. Between the North and South Bulls, a sand bar existed, rising over time, limiting access to the city quays. After years of primitive dredging, an attempt to maintain a clear main channel to Dublin more effectively was begun when, in 1715, the first piles were driven of what was to become the Great South Wall, completed in 1730 to 1731. This barrier was breached by storm action some years later, and in 1761, a stone pier was commenced, working from the Poolbeg Lighthouse, 1768, back to shore, the construction, of massive granite blocks, being completed in 1795. It was during this period that the building of a North Wall was also proposed, and when it was seen that the South Wall did not solve the silting problem, the authorities responsible for Dublin Port commissioned studies on the matter. Captain William Bligh, of Mutiny on the Bounty fame, surveyed Dublin Bay for the Ballast Board in 1801, highlighting the potential of the North Bull sand bank and proposed a design for the wall that was ultimately not used. Bull Bridge, North Bull Wall and the beginning of Bull Island Bull Wall Bridge A wooden bridge, the first Bull Bridge, was erected in 1819 to facilitate the construction of the actual stone wall, based on a design by Ballast Board engineer, George Halpin. Started in 1820, the wall was completed in 1825, at a cost of 95,000 pounds. The total length of the wall is , and there are no parapets. The majority of the wall stands clear of even flood tides, and has a paved surface, but the last stage is in the form of a breakwater, submerged at high tide; the upper surface of this part is not smoothed. At the end of the wall is a masonry base with a lighthouse structure, formerly painted redDublin, Ireland, 1920: \\"The Neighbourhood of Dublin\\", Weston St. John Joyce (3rd edition, enlarged) - Chapter 24 and now painted green. Over the succeeding 48 years, the natural tidal effects created by the two sea walls deepened the entry to the Liffey from 1.8 m to 4.8 m. Much of the silt now scoured from the river course was deposited on the North Bull, and a true island, North Bull Island, began to emerge, with Dubliners venturing out to the growing beach. The volume of visitors was increased by the commencement of horse tram services to Clontarf in 1873, and further by the laying of a tram line to Howth, and a Coast Guard station was built at the landward end of the North Bull Wall. R√©alt na Mara on the Bull Wall R√©alt na Mara While the basic structure of the wall has remained unchanged since the late 19th century, a significant addition was that of a statue of R√©alt na Mara (Our Lady, Star of the Sea), erected from subscriptions from dockers, others working around Dublin Port, and a range of companies. The idea for the statue was suggested in 1950, the foundation stone was blessed on 19 June 1961, and the statue was unveiled and blessed on 24 September 1972. The structure comprises a trio of concrete pillars meeting in a globe, on which the crowned statue of Mary stands; sculpted by Cecil King. The monument is floodlit at night and visible across Dublin Bay.Dublin, Ireland, December 2007: \\"Realt na Mara\\", Leo \\"George\\" Devitt Amenities The wall features multiple public bathing shelters (each designated male or female), with steps down to the water - the water is close by only at mid- to high-tide. There are a number of car parking places, and a public toilet and information signs near the largest of these. Status The Bull Bridge and Bull Wall are technically not public property, nor the property of the local authority, but are owned by the State company which owns and manages Dublin Port. To emphasise this, and perhaps to reduce the possibility of claims of a public right of way, they are closed for a day each year.

He is known in the Anioma music industry as OGB or The Message Man.  Biography  Ogbogu Okonji was born in Ogboli Quarters in Ibusa, Oshimili-North Local Government Area, Delta State, South-south, Nigeria. He began his professional career in music in Ibusa in 1979 but would later move to Lagos where he gained prominence. He is a self-taught musician who joined a traditional music group as a secondary school student, on completing his secondary education, he joined Customs and Excise Department which then was the vogue for the youths of Ibusa but would soon retire from the department to fully pursue a career in traditional music. He further described music as something that gives him joy and fulfillment. \\"I am happy when I make people happy,\\" he also said. Ogbogu began his career by singing in a various musical groups called \\"Otu\\" in the local dialect of Ibusa in which he sang alongside notable musicians from Ibusa such as the famous Agility Okonji, and his first cousin, Etiti Okonji. Quite early in life, Ogbogu and Etiti lost their fathers (Egbuna and Amukaji Okonji)in a mystery circumstances after they were both alleged poisoned through food in 1967. After Ogbogu and Agility parted ways, he released some Albums with his cousin, Etiti as both musicians were united under one \\"Otu\\" (Dancing group) both would later part ways abandoning the \\"Otu\\" as they both pursued their individual careers in traditional music. Ogbogu Okonji in a documentary televised by the African Independent Television (AIT) Tuesday, September 2, 2008 (10.00pm) stated that he began his musical career in 1978. Ogbogu has gained wider popularity among the various Anioma towns and in the southeast, and has particularly excelled in praise-singing for rich Anioma (Igbo) business tycoons. Almost every known business tycoon of Anioma extraction has been praised in his music. He initially started with traditional Anioma or Ibusa style of music using traditional musical instruments such as Udu, Uboma, Agogo, Akpele, Isaka but in 1991 shifted to Ekobe-highlife fusion, which is now a style of his music. Ogbogu's style of music has been quite informative as it exposes the ills and abominations in the Anioma society thus his nickname name, \\"The Message Man.\\" Ogbogu told a gathering that \\"he was tired of being a big fish in a small pond and that now was the time for him to swim in the mighty ocean, stressing that he had got all the experience , skill and agility to swim in the ocean without sinkingDaily Independent, 10 September 2008 He would also tell Q Club, Lagos that \\"I am tired of being a local champion; though I'm known by people who have supported and keep supporting my musical career, I want to be known beyond my area , that is why I have come to you people whom God has given the power to make people popular ,\\" Ogbogu described his greatest challenge as securing a viable label that will release, market and distribute his works, he admittedly said he was unlucky in this area thus a major reason he still remains unknown in the Nigerian music world.

Regimental career Creasey was born in 1923, and educated at Clifton College.\\"Clifton College Register\\" Muirhead, J.A.O. ref no 11348: Bristol; J.W Arrowsmith for Old Cliftonian Society; April, 1948 He joined the Army on leaving school, and was commissioned in the Indian Army on 1942, as a junior officer in the 10th Baluch Regiment. He served with them in South-East Asia, Italy and Greece, before transferring into the British Army and joining the Royal Norfolk Regiment.Obituary: The Times, 7 October 1986. In 1955, he was a major in 39th Infantry Brigade, which served in Kenya during the Mau Mau Uprising, and in the following year experienced a different form of unconventional warfare whilst posted to Northern Ireland, during the 1956 IRA border campaign. After a spell as an instructor at the Staff College, he was promoted to command the 1st Battalion of the newly formed Royal Anglian Regiment in 1965, and saw service in the Aden Emergency. He earned an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for his service in the 1966 Birthday Honours. Senior command After Aden, he was promoted to command 11th Armoured Brigade in the British Army of the Rhine, a post he held from 1968 until 1970, and then attended the Royal College of Defence Studies in 1971. In 1972, he was appointed major-general and seconded to Oman, where he acted as Commander of the Sultan's Armed Forces. The new Sultan, Qaboos bin Said, had been trained at Sandhurst and served in the British Army, and as part of the revitalisation of his forces during the Dhofar Rebellion he requested a large number of British military advisors. Creasey's period in Oman was effective; he quickly established a centralised command of the Army, and helped take the initiative against the Dhofari rebels. His previous experience with the Indian Army proved an asset, as a sizeable proportion of the Omani army was made up of Baluchis. He left in February 1975, with the campaign winding down. After a brief spell as Director of Infantry, he was appointed on 1 November 1977 to succeed Sir David House as General Officer Commanding in Northern Ireland. His experience as a commander had largely been in small-scale \\"colonial wars\\", and as such he was a contentious choice for the position. He aimed to get quick results, and his belief that a military solution could be found to the problem put him at odds with the commander of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, Sir Kenneth Newman. This dispute peaked in 1979, after 18 soldiers were killed in the Warrenpoint ambush, when Creasey demanded the Army take over control of policing. However, he had a good working relationship with Roy Mason, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. He was replaced as commander by Lieutenant-General Sir Richard Lawson on 1 December 1979. Note that the London Gazette announced the handover effective 8 January 1980. He was appointed as Commander-in-Chief, UK Land Forces in 1980, but left this shortly thereafter to return to Oman, at the personal request of the Sultan. Creasey had waived retirement to become Deputy Commander-in-Chief and Chief of Defence Staff, in the Sultan of Oman's Armed Forces in 1981, and oversaw a far-reaching reform of the Ministry of Defence and a modernisation of the army. Among other features, the redesigned system gave him complete control of arms procurement, which with the approval of the Sultan, ensured that many contracts went to British firms. Perhaps unsurprisingly, his role in Oman was controversial in the country, with many senior Omanis criticising his methods.

The film was directed by Henri Verneuil and stars Jean Gabin, Lino Ventura and Alain Delon, whose casting led to the film's box- office success in France.Michael L. Stephens Gangster films  1996 \\"A surprising success in the United States (where it grossed over $2 million), The Sicilian Clan was an enormous box office success in Europe, and remains one of the all-time moneymakers in France. It is yet another variation on the heist gone wrong\\" Ennio Morricone completed the score for the picture. Plot In Paris, jewel thief Roger Sartet escapes from custody with the help of the Manalese, a small-time but well-organised Sicilian Mafia clan led by patriarch Vittorio and which includes his sons Aldo and Sergio and son-in-law Luigi. In prison, Sartet got to know an electrician involved in setting up an extensive security system at a diamond exhibition in Rome -- the electrician returned home early, unannounced, caught his wife in bed with a lover and shot them. Unaccustomed to prison life, he made friends with Sartet and bit-by-bit supplied him with details of the exhibition and its security system. Vittorio and a fellow Mafiose, Tony Nicosia of New York City, go to the exhibition, only to find that changes make a simple robbery difficult. Furthermore, the exhibition hall is near a police station. Nicosia instead comes up with a plan to steal the diamonds while they are en route to another exhibition in New York and sends over Jack, an alcoholic, in order to pass on the details. Meanwhile, Commissaire Le Goff pursues Sartet with unbridled determination -- the gangster having killed two of his men in cold blood during an earlier arrest. Guessing that Sartet needs false papers in order to leave the country, Le Goff's enquiries lead him to the Manalese and their arcade game business which serves as a cover for their illegal activities. While he questions Vittorio, Sartet slips out of the building, under Le Goff's nose. Jeanne, the wife of Vittorio's son Aldo and an able crook, becomes fascinated by Sartet. She has always felt out of place as the only French person in the Sicilian clan. While hiding out, she attracts Sartet's attention by sunbathing nude but as they kiss they are seen by Luigi's six-year-old son Roberto. Jeanne gets the boy to promise not to mention it to anyone. In Rome, the gang discreetly kidnap Edward Evans, the insurance man sent to oversee the transfer of the diamonds to New York. Sartet takes his place and joins the other officials accompanying the diamonds on a regular scheduled flight. Among the passengers joining the plane are Jack, Jeanne, Vittorio and his sons. Things almost go wrong when Evans' wife turns up, but Vittorio leads her to believe that her husband's same numbered flight is on the following day. Having failed to contact, Mrs Evans goes to the police. At police HQ, she identifies Sartet as one of the men she saw on the plane. Meanwhile, the plane is making its descent towards New York when the gang hijacks the aircraft. Warned of Sartet's imminent arrival in the United States, the local police race to the airport while the plane lands on a highway which has been closed off by gang's local members. Other Mafia men waiting in cars unload the diamonds from the plane and split up, Jack for Canada and the Manalese for Paris. Intending to move to Veracruz, Sartet hides out in New York while awaiting his share of the proceeds. Back home, late one evening, the Manalese are watching a film which includes a scene of a couple making out. Roberto exclaims that it looks just what Sartet has done with Jeanne. Jeanne denies the affair but the others tend to believe it. They lure Sartet back to Paris with the promise to give him his share. Jeanne calls Sartet's sister Monique to warn him of the trap. Monique await him at the airport but learns that he boarded an earlier flight. Sartet contacts Vittorio for his share in the jewelry loot meets him, accompanied by Jeanne, on a quiet road outside town. Vittorio shoots both him and Jeanne dead. Leaving both bodies, along with Sartet's money for the police to take care of, Vittorio returns home but is arrested there by Le Goff.

The first had been filmed by Bernard Borderie as Brigade antigangs (1966). Film rights to The Sicilian Clan were bought by Henri Verneuil, who teamed with Jacques-Eric Strauss and signed a deal with 20th Century Fox. Verneuil wrote a screenplay with Pierre Pelegri and then Jos√© Giovanni. Verneuil wrote the two lead roles with Jean Gabin and Alain Delon in mind - he had worked with both men before. As they wrote he decided that the part of the police officer was another strong role and decided to cast Lino Ventura, who had made his film debut in Touchez pas au grisbi (1954) starring Gabin. Irina Demick was unhappy with the role of her character in the film compared to the novel where she was a lot more active, taking part in the hijacking scene. Verneuil felt the actor would not be believable doing this, but she had considerable influence as she was the then- mistress of the head of Fox, Darryl F. Zanuck. So Verneuil rewrote the scene so that Demick's characcter takes part in the hijacking as a stewardess. Shooting Second unit filming started in New York in March 1969. Dialogue scenes started on March 24 at the \\"Franstudio\\" in Saint-Maurice. The film was shot in two versions - French and English. At the time, Delon was involved in a real-life scandal, the Markovic affair, in which his former bodyguard Stevan Markoviƒá had been found murdered. Release The film had its premiere in Paris on 8 December 1969. Reception In the book French Cinema: From Its Beginnings to the Present, author R√©mi Fournier Lanzoni wrote, \\"This gangster film reinvented the classic gangster genre, elevating it to a higher level with its hard-boiled acting, deep character studies, and attractive photography.\\" Critical According to the New York Times the film \\"has its occasional momemnts... but mostly it's a tired example of a tired genre.\\"Screen: Verneuil's 'The Sicilian Clan' By VINCENT CANBY.

Early life Bunbury was born in Glastonbury, England in 1940, to an Australian father and an English mother. He graduated with an honours degree from the University of Durham in 1963, then decided to visit his father's homeland, Australia. He worked as a farmhand on his cousin's farm in Broomehill for 2 months before moving to Perth, where he taught English at Guildford Grammar School. A visit to the school by an ABC television crew introduced Bunbury to ABC producer Roger Penny. Penny recommended Bill to apply for an ABC position and he joined the ABC'S Education in May 1969. Career Bunbury's first couple of years at the ABC consisted of radio work. He moved to television shortly afterwards to present a children's program called Here in the West. Later, while making a film series about significant communities, he came across the experience of Group Settlers in Denmark, Western Australia in the 1920s. Unable to get funds for a TV production he recorded a 30 minute radio documentary THEY SAID YOU'D OWN YOUR OWN FARM Its unexpected popularity prompted Bunbury to move full time to radio, travelling around Western Australia recording series called LIVING HISTORY. In 1985, historian and broadcaster Tim Bowden founded the ABC's social history unit, and invited Bill to join the unit. He had already produced a Background Briefing on the death of John Pat in the Pilbara and then produced Hindsight', Verbatim, Street Stories and Encounter. He retired from the ABC in 2007. Bunbury said, \\"I wanted to go while I was still doing good work. I think I've quit while I was, hopefully, still winning races. I think maybe some [journalists] retire too early. Perhaps some go on [working] too long. You try to pick the right time.\\" He has subsequently worked with Community Arts WA, producing radio features which assist Aboriginal communities to tell their own stories and has also presented VoicePrints for the Perth International Arts Festival' Bunbury's documentary series covered such topics as Cyclone Tracy, Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War, and the granting of equal wages to Aboriginal stockmen in 1966. His work had a strong focus on Indigenous Australian history. Bunbury won several awards for his radio programmes and series, including the NSW Premier's Media Prize in 1996 for his six part series UNFINISHED BUSINESS,- RECONCILIATION & THE REPUBLIC, the New York Radio Festival Gold medal for Best History Documentary, \\"Timber for Gold\\", Gold Mining and Timber ] in Kalgoorlie, and the UN Australia Peace Prize for \\"The War Rages On\\", Australians in Vietnam. His interest in oral history and recording of people's memories has created a vast resource in the Western Australian state library, Battye Library, of recorded interviews with people from various documentaries and programmes. Journalist Andre Malan has described this as Bunbury's legacy, \\"a priceless archive of the State's rich oral history that would otherwise have been lost forever\\".

In his youth he played with Union Riga and ƒÄgenskalns sports club; but he became widely known in 1921 when playing for ƒ∂eizarme≈æs. Alongside his brothers Kurts Plade, Teodors Plade and Alfrƒìds Plade, who all also played with ƒ∂eizarme≈æs, Plade won Latvian league titles in 1922 and 1923. Unlike his brothers, Plade proved to be a long-lasting force in Latvian football and he was a national team regular from 1923 to 1929, capping 16 international appearances and scoring 9 goals. In a match against Lithuania at the 1929 Baltic Cup Plade scored three goals for Latvia from passes from the rising star ƒíriks Pƒìtersons. Plade represented Latvia at the 1924 Summer Olympics. After the dissolution of ƒ∂eizarme≈æs in 1925, Plade joined RFK with which he played for two years. After two years with RFK Plade joined the newly founded Riga Vanderer with which he occasionally played until 1935. As early as 1933 Plade also took up coaching, working with V. ƒ∂uze, UniversitƒÅtes Sports, Riga Vanderer and LAS Riga, from at least 1936 he also appeared regularly as a football referee.

Made from a variety of materials, its function is to provide a layer of comfort especially when the existing mattress is worn or uncomfortable, and have been shown to improve a user's quality of sleep.  Common types of mattress toppers   Pillow top mattress toppers  Pillow top mattress toppers are filled with natural fibers such as cotton or down, or synthetic options such as microfiber. The filling is usually segmented into pockets which help them stay in place. This is similar to quilts, though mattress toppers are usually 4 inches or thicker. The variant of mattress toppers are present in most hotel beds and is responsible for their plush feel. Eggshell mattress toppers are a good way to extend the life of an older bed.  Memory foam mattress toppers  Visco-elastic foam toppers are made from visco- elastic polyurethane, also known as \\"memory foam\\". This is a type of material that exhibitst both viscous and elastic characteristics when undergoing deformation. Viscous materials, like water, resist shear flow and strain linearly with time when a stress is applied. The foam used in the construction of these memory foam toppers reacts to both pressure and temperature. This, combined with its greater density, are properties that give them their characteristic \\"weightlessness\\" sensation. Memory foam mattress toppers are touted to optimize support and promote proper spinal alignment during sleep. They are also regularly used in medical institutions because of their pressure relieving properties.  Latex mattress toppers  Latex is derived from rubber tree sap and feels springy as well as responsive. There are 2 main methods of manufacturing latex: = Dunlop Latex = Dunlop latex is heavier on one side than the other due to sedimentation during the foaming process. As such, it is primarily used for support layers of a bed. = Tatalay Latex = Tataly Latex is flash frozen, which results in a lighter, fluffier foam. It lacks support and is used primarily as a comfort layer.  Others  An electric mattress pad is made of heavy fabric with heating filaments woven into it.

Life He was born to Jewish parents and was the youngest of three sons. His father, Herman van Praag, worked in the diamond trade. His mother's name was Grietje de Jongh. Apart from his Dutch and Jewish cultural roots, Siegfried's education also introduced him to French language and culture. He pursued French studies at the Universiteit van Amsterdam, after which he became a lecturer at the Hogereburgerscholen in Purmerend. In the same year that Van Praag published his first novel De Weegschaal, he also married Hilda Sanders, a journalist. These new changes in his life came at the expense of his teaching career, which was abandoned for the time being. Still he remained active as an academic by publishing articles that were primarily concerned with Jewish and French literature. Also, his wife's profession may have introduced him to radio broadcasting, an occupation which van Praag held during various phases of his life. The rise of Nazism may have prompted a move to Brussels in 1936, and was definitely the reason why van Praag and his family left the continent for England in 1940. In London he worked for the Dutch and Belgian radio programmes of the BBC. The war made a considerable impression on van Praag and his consequent preoccupation with Jewish culture and identity‚Äîspecifically Dutch Jewish culture and the newly formed country of Israel‚Äîcan be noted in the published works that follow this period. But unlike so many other artists who were exiled to England or The New World he did return to Europe after the war, settling in the Netherlands once more. Still writing, he now also resumed his teaching career and taught in at a Lyceum in Overveen, then later at the Nutsacademie in Rotterdam. Though his greatest relevance is as a novelist, van Praag was also an essayist and an autobiographical writer. His autobiography De Arend en de Mol (The Eagle and the Mole) was published in 1973, but because of his fierce interest in Jewish identity some of his fictional and non- fictional writings may also have an autobiographical ring to them: thus Een Lange Jeugd in Joods Amsterdam (A Long Youth in Jewish Amsterdam) reflects van Praag's own experience growing up in 'Jewish' Amsterdam. By the 1980s he was nearing the end of his writing career, though he lived for another 20 years.

It was the world's longest sea wall at the time of its construction and remains one of the longest in Europe. It faces the newer Bull Wall, and has one of four port lighthouses at its end. History Background Dublin Bay had a long-running problem with silting, notably at the mouth of the River Liffey, and held major sand banks, notably the North Bull and South Bull (both hard sand dry at low waterDublin, Ireland: Collins, Greenville Capt., Map, 1686, surveyed after 1681), to either side of the Liffey mouth, along with the Kish Bank over 11 km out to sea. Between the North and South Bulls, a sand bar existed, rising over time, limiting access to the city quays. Furthermore, the shape of the Liffey estuary was rather different from the present day, with the river channel not fully enclosed, much of Pearse Street (then Lazey Hill) running along the shore, which then bent sharply south, running in a diagonal to Irishtown, with Ringsend being a narrow sand spit projecting north into the bay. To Ringsend Reclamation of the lands between the city and Ringsend progressed during the 17th and early 18th century, accelerated by the foundation of the Ballast Office in 1707, and by the granting of an estate there to Sir John Rogerson in 1713. Rogerson paid for a massive quay, all the way to a new mouth for the River Dodder, adjacent to Ringsend. Commencement Years of primitive dredging were succeeded by an attempt to maintain a clear main channel to Dublin more effectively when, in 1715, the Dublin City Assembly authorised the building of an embankment from Ringsend along the north aspect of the South Bull sand bank. The first piles of what was to become the South Bull Wall were driven that year, and major work commenced in 1717, with what was then known simply as The Piles completed in 1730 to 1731. Construction involved driving of oaken piles into the boulder clay of Dublin Bay, with these anchored by baskets of gravel, and woven wattles. A stone wall linking The Piles to the quays, The Ballast Office Wall, was completed in 1756, and the first Pigeon House at the shoreward end of the piles was built around 1760 as a residence for a caretaker. Over a period, a bank of sand and other debris, the White Bank, developed adjacent to the wall about 800m seawards of the Pigeon House. The driven-pile barrier was breached by storm action, after reported rotting and tidal stress, and in 1761, a stone pier was commenced, working from the Poolbeg Lighthouse (commenced in 1761, operational 1767) back to shore. The construction, of massive granite blocks, brought from quarries at Dalkey, was completed in 1795. The final wall dimensions were 32 feet at the base, tapering to 28 feet at the top. In the meantime, in 1791, the Pigeon House Harbour was planned, while in 1793, a gun battery, named the Half-Moon Battery for its shape, was built about 800m shorewards of the lighthouse. Also around 1793, a hotel, the Pigeon House Hotel was opened. Following temporary military arrangements after the 1798 Rebellion, the Pigeon House Fort was created, maintained from 1814 to 1897. At its peak, it included gates with trenches crossed by drawbridges at the beginning of the wall, quarters for officers and men, a hospital, armoury, magazine and stores. In 1897, the complex was sold to Dublin Corporation for development to include the city‚Äôs first major electricity generating station and a sewage processing facility, as well as reuse of the hospital. This followed the installation, between 1878 and 1881, of a sewage pipe along the wall, discharging at the White Bank. Structure and access Much of the wall is now encompassed by port facilities, or lies within the Poolbeg Generation Station complex. Public access now generally begins with the part of the wall just beyond the power station, which has parking adjacent. The area is no longer served by public transport since changes to Dublin Bus routes in mid-May 2012 saw the limited service to Poolbeg Power Station discontinued. The last bus operated on the morning of Saturday 12 May 2012. Isle of Man passenger ship, Lady of Mann, passes behind Poolbeg Lighthouse, 2004 At the seaward end of the wall stands the red-painted Poolbeg Lighthouse, standing in its current form since 1820, having replaced an earlier light-tower, which in turn replaced a 1782 light- ship. The Ordnance Survey, and later Ordnance Survey Ireland, used the low water mark of the spring tide on 8 April 1837 at the lighthouse as the standard height datum for Ireland until 1958.

History The museum officially opened its doors to the public in 2004. It is housed in a historic 150-year-old five- story building - once an elegant home to a Greek family - located in the heart of bustling Beyoƒülu district of Istanbul. Just like a vast number of other important landmark buildings in Beyoglu, the museum was originally in a state of complete disrepair when Burhan Doƒüan√ßay purchased it in 1999. From the very beginning, however, Dogancay envisaged that this architecturally inviting building would become his museum. Following a major four-year renovation, it was restored to its former glory and its interior converted to meet exacting museum standards.Dogancay Museum, retrieved 1 June 2015 It was Doƒüan√ßay‚Äôs plan to commit a considerable amount of time and energy to provide a home that would showcase a mini-retrospective, spanning over five decades of his prolific and rich artistic production.Dogancay Chronology, retrieved 1 June 2015 Even the elevator car provides exhibition space for a small display of photographs from photographic ‚ÄúThe Ironworkers Project‚Äù. Since 2010, the Doƒüan√ßay Museum has been operated under the auspices of the Burhan-Angela Doƒüan√ßay Foundation for Art and Culture. When Burhan Dogancay died in 2013, the foundation stopped collecting his works of art and began to concentrate on presenting what it already owned. Far beyond its material worth, the true value of the museum and its collection lies in the pleasure and passion for art it ignited in thousands of visitors from all over the world. A full-time director takes care of its day-to-day business, educational programs and special events. Upon entering the museum, visitors are amazed how one instantly leaves behind the hustle and bustle of the city.New York Times Obituary, retrieved 1 June 2015 Layout While the museum is dedicated almost exclusively to the work of its founder Burhan Doƒüan√ßay, one floor has been set aside for the work of the artist's father, Adil Doƒüan√ßay, a well- known Turkish impressionist painter. With over 100 works on display, the museum offers a stunning visual survey of the evolution of Burhan Doƒüan√ßay‚Äôs oeuvre, from his early figurative paintings to his wall-inspired art. The collection covers a wide range of media and materials and includes paintings, drawings, sculptures, prints, photographs and Aubusson tapestries. It was Doƒüan√ßay‚Äôs explicit intention that the Museum collection would demonstrate how far the speaking walls, which initially provided the inspiration for his work, have developed in experimental and exciting ways over the past five decades. Ground floor The museum's reception area is located on the ground floor, as is its gift shop and tearoom, where visitors are treated to tea each afternoon. An Aubusson tapestry based on a Ribbons Series design (one of fourteen that have been produced at L‚ÄôAtelier Raymond Picaud), photographs, and lithographs are also exhibited in this area. A photographic portrait of Dogan√ßay taken by Christa Frieda Vogel greets visitors as they enter from the street. First floor On the first floor, of particular note are works from the Cones Series and the Ribbons Series that both emerged in the early 1970s, marking an important transition from Dogan√ßay‚Äôs hitherto realistic rendering of weather-beaten, grimy walls to a more refined, abstract approach that incorporates elegant experiments in shadow and light and dimension. Also exhibited on the first floor are examples from the GREGO Series, named after a New York graffiti artist who almost became an alter ego for Dogan√ßay, enabling him to demonstrate through artwork how walls speak of issues and address passersby. Second floor On the second floor, the display from various Dogan√ßay wall-inspired series begins. While urban walls may be their recurring theme, the different styles in which they are rendered and the techniques employed vary greatly from series to series. Third floor Visitors will discover the Adil Doƒüan√ßay Collection and Early Figurative Works by Burhan Doƒüan√ßay. Throughout his artistic career, Adil Doƒüan√ßay cultivated Impressionist sensibilities as well as their techniques. Up close the use of open and relatively heavy brushwork is most apparent, yet observed from a distance each painting seems to capture a moment in time, in which the light and line of its subject is everything. Elementary school art competition Since 2005, the museum in cooperation with the Greater Istanbul Municipality and corporate sponsors, has organized and presented a juried elementary school art competition. Each year an average of 7,000 students between the ages of eight to fourteen, from 1,500 schools, have submitted their applications for this event.

Adult females can be from long. Males are slightly smaller (body length ) and have dark brown wings, which are absent in females. It is stoutly built, with a reddish head and brown to black body segments with prominent yellow margins. The femora are heavily spined, with the hind tibiae having two very broad ridges with only two rows of spurs. They are nocturnal and herbivorous. Unusually for insects, it gives birth to 18‚Äì24 live offspring and protects the young for a while after giving birth. Family groups are found in late summer and autumn: a brood of black nymphs, a wingless female and two or more males, all living in a hidden crack. When alarmed, it raises its abdomen into the air and squeaks loudly; it also releases a foul-smelling liquid from glands on the back when handled and alarmed, producing an indelible brown stain on skin. The only other species in the genus Aptera, A. munda, is rare, and is found in the Richtersveld.

It competed in the BPR Global GT Series in the mid 1990s. Background and development The early 1990s was particularly difficult for Group Lotus, as the repercussions of global recession were severe for all sports car manufacturers. During 1992 the Lotus dealer franchise network contracted from 29 to 19 outlets, as production of the long- running Excel and recently relaunched Elan M100 ended. Furthermore, by August 1993 General Motors had disposed of the company. In addition, although Team Lotus had remained independent from Group Lotus since 1954, its fortunes in Formula One would mirror those of the production side. With its bankruptcy in 1994, Lotus were left without any motorsport programme and production exclusively concentrated on the Esprit. It was apparent that single model production could not be sustained indefinitely. Coinciding with the decline in Lotus's fortunes were the performance of the Type 105 and 106 (X180R) cars in the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) Escort World Challenge between 1991 and 1992. These performances were an invaluable tool for Lotus's North American Marketing. The kudos of owning a proven race winner was important in securing increased sales against the established race brands of Porsche and Ferrari. Lotus‚Äô reputation of being a manufacturer of fragile and unreliable cars had been improved with being successful in endurance racing. The exploits of the works team was replicated by privateers in both America and Europe. Doc Bundy won the 1992 Bridgestone Supercar Championship drivers title with the Esprit X180R whilst Tom Langeberg won the Koni Production Car Series in the Netherlands. Although it was never conceived as such, the Lotus Esprit (now in the twilight of its career) was proving itself to be a credible racing car. Having raced the Esprit in GT2 and GT3 classes, Lotus began to develop a new version of the car to race in GT1. Development of the car was entrusted to the newly formed Lotus GT1 Engineering group, which included many staff from the recently dissolved Team Lotus. The newly developed racing car utilised the type 114 steel tubular chassis paired with a body of the Esprit S4 made entirely from carbon fibre. Lotus‚Äô expertise and investment helped modify the 3.5 litre type 918 V8 engine to produce . This power was transmitted through a six-speed Hewland TGT200 sequential manual gearbox. The final car weighed just over 900 kg. Accompanying the factory support was the involvement of elements of the now defunct Team Lotus. For example, Lotus Engineering was based at the former headquarters of Team Lotus (Ketteringham Hall) and included Alex Zanardi in the driver line-up. The Type 114 benefited from Formula One expertise of Team Lotus and included improved aerodynamics and data- acquisition systems. Performance The Lotus Esprit GT1 utilised the 3.5 L type 918 twin-turbo V8 engine of then newly launched Lotus Esprit V8. The engine was extensively reworked with the addition of one Garrett T4 turbocharger, a flat plane crankshaft, forged aluminium pistons, multipoint fuel injection and an air-to-air intercooler. All of these modifications increased the power to at 5400 rpm and of torque at 3600 rpm. The problematic Renault 5-speed gearbox was replaced by the new 6-speed Hewland sequential manual transmission resulting in better gear shifts. The car could accelerate from 0- in 3.8 seconds and had a top speed in excess of . The front suspension now had upper and lower A-arms, while at the rear were upper and lower lateral links paired with upper and lower trailing links. Brakes were AP Racing carbon-ceramic discs with 6-piston callipers at the front and the rear, and Penske triple-adjustable gas-pressurised shock absorbers were used at all four wheels with the tires being provided by Michelin. The chassis was similar to the production Esprit but with a roll-cage that added stiffness. Weight was down to . The car faced reliability issues during its career and was eventually retired from racing. Racing history The success of the Type 114 in the GT2 category gave Lotus the confidence to compete in the prestigious GT1 series the following season. In 1995, Lotus Engineering was formed using core personnel from the recently closed Lotus Formula One team. The new team's sole purpose was to design and develop a dedicated GT1 version of the Lotus Esprit V8 and to compete with them in the 1996 BPR Global GT series, with a future view to competing at the 24 ours of LeMans race. The GT1 hardly shared any components with the road-going Esprit. The silhouette was very similar to the road car but aside from rear light lenses, exterior door handles and badges virtually all else was either purpose made or were dedicated race components. Aesthetically the production model had been refreshed by new head of design Julian Thompson and relaunched as the S4 in 1993. These design alternations were incorporated as part of a wider package of aerodynamic improvements that included a carbon fibre splitter, diffuser and revised floor. Lotus also took the opportunity to include its new V8 engine which combined with one Garrett intercooled turbocharger was able to produce 550bhp. These improvements allowed the Type 114 to compete in the prestigious GT1 category. The new car debuted for the 1996 GT Series at the Circuit Paul Ricard, however, its retirement with a fractured exhaust highlighted the fragility that would persist throughout the season. Unfortunately it soon became apparent that to be successful in the GT1 category required similar budgets and development schedule of the Porsche, McLaren and Mercedes teams. The improvements to the 114 did not match its stunning debut season, although its presence at international sportscar races helped to sell over 250 V8 Esprits in 1996. There were a number of reasons that account for the second generation Type 114's relative failure in sportscar racing. Firstly the Esprit had been in production for 21 years and, despite the design being continually refreshed, it still retained some fundamental drawbacks. For example, its wide flat screen rendered it aerodynamically inferior to the McLaren F1s and Porsche 911s that it was competing against. Also the previous season's Lotus type 900-derived engine had been in production and progressively improved over twenty three years. The inclusion of the new V8 required development work by Lotus Racing and Lotus Engineering, arguably making the type 114 a test bed for the Type 115 that was to replace it but the newly developed Hewland gearbox proved to be problematic and eventually led to the car's demise. Ironically the Type 115 would abandon this engine in preference for the Chevrolet LT5-based engine that Lotus had originally designed. Three cars were built: chassis 114-001, 114-002 and 114-003. Two cars debuted at the 1996 BPR Global GT Series 4 Hours of Donington. Reliability dogged the car throughout the year and it was succeeded by the Type 115 Elise GT1 the next year. Two of the Esprit GT1s were converted to GT2. Chassis 114-001 was acquired by Mark Haines Racing, who developed it into a competitive GT2 car. Chassis 114-002 was damaged at Oulton Park and became a parts donor for the remaining cars. Chassis 114-003 was destroyed in a fire. Ultimately it would be Lotus' characteristic literal rule interpretation that would end the works involvement on the Esprit's racing career. During 1996 the FIA GT rules concerning homologation requirements were changed in an attempt to alter the emphasis of the series from sports to racing cars. Indeed, only a single production car needed to be manufactured. Therefore, as manufacturers such as McLaren produced their F1 GTR 97, Lotus took the opportunity to showcase the recently launched Elise and concentrate efforts on running the Lotus Elise GT1 (Type 115) model in the 1997 season.

The prominent butte gives its name to a small community at its base, and to a small creek that runs into the Moreau River. Geography  Thunder Butte was formed by differential erosion. Its summit is 2,733 feet (833.02 meters) above sea level,Thunder Butte Summit, South Dakota Mountain Peak Information and rises some three to five hundred feet (90 - 150 metres) above the surrounding grasslands. Thunder Butte is the highest point in Ziebach County. Thunder Butte lies on the drainage divide between the Grand River, to the north, and the Moreau River to the south; both rivers drain eastward to the Missouri. The butte is located about 75 miles (120 km) west of the Missouri River, and about 105 miles (170 km) northeast of the Black Hills, (both distances as the crow flies).

In August 1823, on the south fork of the Grand River (located north west of Thunder Butte, in Perkins County, South Dakota), Hugh Glass encountered a grizzly bear and was so badly mauled that he was left for dead by the others in his party. Reviving, he found himself alone and unable to travel except by crawling. Hugh Glass crawled from the Grand River to the Moreau River and then on south to the Cheyenne River, a distance of some 80 to 100 miles (130 - 160 km). This \\"crawl\\" consumed six weeks. After reaching the Cheyenne River, Hugh Glass recuperated for a time and then fashioned a crude raft on which he floated down the Cheyenne River and Missouri River to Fort Kiowa. The Grand-to-Moreau-to-Cheyenne River \\"crawl\\" took Glass by Thunder Butte on the divide between the Moreau and Grand Rivers, and factual and fictional accounts note that in making his crawl to the Cheyenne River, Hugh Glass navigated by watching Thunder Butte which was first ahead, then alongside, then behind him.See, for example, \\"Lord Grizzley\\", Frederick Manfred, 1954, First Signet Printing 1964, pp. 179 to 215. Thunder Butte has been commemorated by white settlers who saw beauty and majesty in the prominent landmark. The following poem was written by G. M.

Notes Many other buttes in this area of western South Dakota are capped by erosional remnants. Besides the Ludlow Formation, buttes in this area are capped by the Tongue River formations, White River Group sediments, and clinker beds formed by the combustion of coal seams which bake the surrounding rock into a hard erosion resistant layer.E-mail,South Dakota Geological Survey Program, August 19, 2008 After Hugh Glass (see above) had been mauled by a bear in 1823 and appeared to be in a dying state, two of the Ashley party were left to await his death and bury him. As Glass lingered, the two grew increasingly fearful of becoming random casualties of Indian bands roaming the valley of the Grand River. Eventually they panicked, and took off with Hugh Glass' rifle and other possessions, reporting to Ashley that Glass had died and been buried. One of the two may have been Jim Bridger, then making his first foray across the Great Plains to the Rockies. According to legend, Glass later caught up with Bridger, but forgave him because of his youth.http://www.historynet.com/hugh-glass-legendary-trapper-in-americas- western-frontier.htm/2 Hugh Glass Biography on HistoryNet.com Jim Bridger became a celebrated mountain man of the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains.

Majorettes can also spin knives, fire knives, flags, light-up batons, fire batons, maces and rifles. They do illusions, cartwheels, and flips, and sometimes twirl up to four batons at a time.\\"Twirl/Majorette info\\" Majorettes are often confused with cheerleaders; baton twirling, however, is more closely related to rhythmic gymnastics than to cheerleading. Origin and development University of Texas at Arlington majorettes, circa 1960s Majorettes performed originally a typical carnival dance originating in the Rhineland, where the young women who perform this dance are called \\"Tanzmariechen\\" (Dance Marys) in German or Dansmarietjes in Dutch. During the carnival the normal form of government is parodied. Also the army and the defense forces were traditionally parodied as a way of protesting against the Prussian occupation of the Rhenish area at the time. In Cologne, these imitations arose in particular to make Prussian militarism look ridiculous. And with a joke army that did just about everything, it would make a normal company look ridiculous. The tanzmariechen show clear origins in the camp followers in the 18th and 19th century, and have a vibrant and eventful past. Around this time Germany had a very large number of armies, and there would be young women in each regiment, who served during the day as sellers and providers of food and drink and took on household chores like washing clothes. At the same time, many of these women and girls offered themselves as prostitutes, for which they would dress themselves more provocatively, and they would dance for the soldiers. Around 1800 more regulations began to emerge in the armies. Slowly these were also applied to the camp followers. Increasingly, the camp follower was a woman who was married to a corporal or private, and whose task it was among other things \\"to wash the linen\\", according to an old army decision. The camp follower became not a typical army prostitute anymore, but also not a proper married women. Besides caring for the soldiers, she could still continue entertaining them in various ways. In the carnival mockery both the officers and the camp followers were depicted. The officer by portraying him as an effeminate, wig-wearing, conceited fool, the camp follower as a woman who was military but provocatively costumed, but also clearly recognizable as a man: the Tanzmarie. In the late nineteenth century, the carnival associations found further inspiration in the revue girls that performed in the theater at the time. These were scantily clad young women, accompanied by some military attributes like peak helmets and military backpacks, which showed provocative dances in small groups. The revue girl grew into a nightclub-like star. It can not be denied that the carnival with its Tanzmariechen has popularized and even parodied the sparkling shows that could otherwise be enjoyed only in the major European cities. Young women and girls again took on the role of tanzmariechen instead of men and they performed at the parades during the post-war carnival. A show element was added to carnival, partly because of rapidly evolving ballet education. Majorettes or tanzmariechen began increasingly to act in groups. Some parts of the Prussian military background are sometimes still reflected today in the movements, music or clothing of the majorettes. The somewhat slovenly camp follower who accompanied the troops, has evolved into a show dance group, but still inspired by the Prussian army. This metamorphosis went through the intermediate step of the role performed by men as Tanzmarie. Although the current majorette has her roots in the carnival scene, the associations of majorettes widely break these historical ties, and profile themselves more as a sports or dance club.

Biography Robert of Lexinton was a son of Richard of Lexinton (probably the first son, according to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, probably the second according to the Dictionary of National Biography. His father for a time administered the manor of Laxton in Nottinghamshire (formerly Lexington, from whence the family's name derived). Robert's brothers included Henry of Lexington, sometime Bishop of Lincoln, and Stephen of Lexington, a Cistercian monk and abbot of Clairvaux abbey. He made his start as a clerk to a successor of his father as keeper of the manor of Laxton, one Brian de Lisle. In 1214 he was appointed as a prebendary of the collegiate church of Southwell, and later succeeded to the barony of his father, who was alive in 1216. By 1221, he was acting as a justice in seven counties, and comes to notice in February 1221 as the author of a letter to Hubert de Burgh informing him of the route taken by the rebel Earl of Aumale and of the measures that he had adopted to secure the safety of the border. He continued to be employed in a like capacity in later years, being in 1225 the head of six judicial commissions. He was warden of the honour and castle of Peak and governor of Bolsover Castle in Derbyshire, and also had charge of Orford Castle. He is described as a justice ‚Äòde banco‚Äô in 1226, and as one of the chief members of the king's court, or bench, in 1229, when he sat with other judges at Westminster to hear the case between the convent and the townsmen of Dunstable. There is reason to suppose that in 1234 he was the senior of the justices of the king's bench. In 1239 he is said to have been elected to the see of Lichfield, but, the right of election being then in dispute between the canons of Lichfield and the monks of Coventry, to have declined it. When in 1240 Henry III sent justices itinerant through the whole kingdom in the hope of raising money by fines and the like, he appointed Robert chief of the justices for the northern division of England. When he and his brother-justices sat at Lincoln they were denounced by the dean of Christianity (or ‚Äòrural dean‚Äô) for trying capital cases on Sunday. In return they abused the dean, and caused his goods and the lands of his nieces, his wards, to be seized on behalf of the crown. Bishop Robert Grosseteste wrote him a sharp rebuke for his presumption in dealing thus with a clerk. He again acted as a justice itinerant the following year. After having gained a high reputation and large possessions, he was seized with paralysis, and retired from office a few years before his death, spending the remainder of his life in prayer and almsgiving. He died on 29 May 1250, and was succeeded by his elder brother John. He founded three chantries in the chapel of St. Thomas the Martyr in Southwell Minster.

In February 1979 he began a journalism cadetship on the Sydney afternoon newspaper The Sun and later worked for The Sydney Morning Herald as a court reporter and police roundsman. In 1986, he went to London, where he worked as a reporter and sub-editor for various UK national newspapers before becoming a staff feature writer on The Mail on Sunday in 1989. As a feature writer, Michael was among the first people to view the letters and diaries of Tsar Nicholas II and his wife Empress Alexandra, unearthed in the Moscow State Archives in 1991. He also gained access to Stalin's Hitler files, which had been missing for nearly fifty years until a cleaner stumbled upon a cardboard box that had been misplaced and misfiled. The archives also revealed secrets about Rasputin and the nuclear accident at Chernobyl. Robotham rose to become deputy features editor of The Mail on Sunday before resigning in May 1993 and accepting freelancing contracts with a number of British newspapers and magazines. In November 1993 he accepted his first ghostwriting commission, helping Nottingham social worker Margaret Humphreys to pen her autobiography, Empty Cradles. Published in 1994, it told the story of how she uncovered the truth behind Britain's Child Migrant Program, which saw more than 100,000 children sent abroad between 1850 and 1967, and established the Child Migrant Trust to reunite children with their families. In 2011 Empty Cradles became the basis of the film Oranges and Sunshine directed by Jim Loach and starring Emily Watson as Margaret Humphreys and Hugo Weaving and David Wenham as two of the child migrants. Michael Robotham went on to collaborate on fifteen \\"autobiographies\\" for people in the arts, politics, the military and sport. Twelve of these titles became Sunday Times bestsellers and sold more than 2 million copies. These books included the autobiographies of Spice Girl Geri Halliwell, British comedy actor Ricky Tomlinson and sixties musical legend Lulu. In 1996 Robotham returned to Australia with his family and continued writing full-time. In 2002, a partial manuscript of his first novel, The Suspect, became the subject of a bidding war at the London Book Fair.

Life Family and private life Claude Catherine de Clermont was born in Paris, the only child of Claude de Clermont-Tonnerre and of Jeanne de Vivonne. In 1561, at 18, she married Jean d'Annebaut, but found herself widowed at 20 after he was killed in the battle of Dreux in 1563. In 1565, she married for a second time, to Albert de Gondi, duc de Retz. Their children included Jean-Fran√ßois de Gondi (later archbishop of Paris) and Claude-Marguerite de Gondi (later Marquise de Maignelay and patroness of the Madelonnettes Convent). During the absence of her spouse, she assembled troops at his expense to drive off robbers threatening his lands, led them herself and forced the robbers to take flight. Court career Beautiful and courteous, Catherine was made lady in waiting to queen Catherine de' Medici. She was later appointed Governess of the Children of France. She spoke several living languages. In 1573, when ambassadors from Poland came to see the duke of Anjou, she publicly replied to them in Latin on behalf of the queen-mother and her speech took on those of Ren√© de Birague and the comte de Cheverny, who replied on behalf of Charles IX and the duke of Anjou. Cultural activity She spoke Latin, Greek and several living languages. She acquired a great reputation as an intellectual, becoming known as the \\"10th Muse\\" and the \\"4th Grace\\". The Croix du Maine wrote that: :\\"she deserved to be in the first rank of those learned and well- versed in poetry, oratory, philosophy, mathematics, history and other sciences\\". Holding a salon and regularly attending the sittings of the Acad√©mie du Palais, she was also a patroness of the arts, supporting the foundation of Jean-Antoine de Ba√Øf's Acad√©mie de musique et de po√©sie in 1570. She circulated her own writings mostly in manuscript, so that little of it has been preserved.

It lies near the village of Samovodene, seven kilometres north of Veliko Tarnovo, in central northern Bulgaria. It is one of the five stauropegic monasteries of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church. It is thought that the monastery was founded in the 11th century AD as a cloister of the Vatopedi monastery on Mount Athos. In 1360, when Tarnovo was the capital of the Second Bulgarian Empire and the traditions of hesychasm were popular in Bulgaria, it became an autonomous monastery on the order of Tsar Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria. This is legendarily tied to the charity of Ivan Alexander's second wife Sarah-Theodora and their son Ivan Shishman, a reason to also call the monastery Sarah's or Shishman's monastery. After the Ottoman conquest of Bulgaria, the monastery was plundered and burned several times by the Turks and eventually entirely destroyed. It was only reestablished in 1825 by father Zoticus of the Rila Monastery by means of donations. In 1832, a firman of the Ottoman sultan allowed the construction of a new monastery church; the church was designed by the noted Bulgarian National Revival architect Kolyu Ficheto and completed in 1834. The cross-shaped church features three apses, a single dome and a covered narthex. The icons and frescoes of the main church were painted by another famous artist, Zahari Zograf, who worked in the monastery between 1849 and 1851, after he finished his decoration of the Troyan Monastery. Among the more notable murals are those of the Last Judgment, the Wheel of Life, the Birth of the Mother of God, the Last Supper. Zograf also painted Saints Cyril and Methodius, as well as a self-portrait. In addition, the main church was richly decorated on the outside and a wood-carved and gold-plated iconostasis was installed. Between 1858 and 1863 Kolyu Ficheto constructed the seven-bell belfry, the residential buildings and the main entrance, as well as the underground chapel of Saint Andrew the First-called and the small Church of the Annunciation on top of it, with icons by Zahari Zograf's nephew Stanislav Dospevski.

In 2000 he was awarded Padma Shri by Government of India for his excellent and devoted work in the field of Sanskrit.  Early life  He was born on 7 June 1929 in a small village (Hanutiya) around 50 km away from Jaipur in Rajasthan who made it very big in the world for his dedicated work in Sanskrit. His father was a Hindu Scholar and mother a house wife. He is the eldest of the 5 brothers and 2 sisters. He was married to bharti mishra. He took his last breath on 15 November 2001. He was survived with 1 daughter (recently expired) and 3 sons.his eldest son shri bhaskar mishra is a professor in Sanskrit at the lal bahadur shastri university. His second son shri ravi mishra (with three children two daughters and a son Akshat Mishra who is serving as Awards Head at Franchise India Holdings Limited.) is serving as the general manager in jk tyres and the third son shri Arun Mishra is a businessman. Dr. Mandan Mishra took his primary education from Amarsar and high education under the guidance of Shri Pattabhiramshastriji. The relationship and the principle of this teacher-student is famous all over the world.  His career  He was the only Vice-Chancellor of such repute that almost all presidents and Prime Ministers of India appreciated his knowledge and dedication towards Sanskrit language. Under his guidance and leadership a group went to USA to promote Sanskrit as a language. Dr. Mandan Mishra started his career asa lecturer in Maharaja Sanskrit College, Jaipur. He was later upgraded as a Professor. Dr. Mandan Mishra was elected as Minister in 1956 and Minister-in-Chief in 1959 to All India Sanskrit Literature Association, a representative Association of Sanskrit established by Pt. Madan Mohan Malaviya. By then All India Sanskrit Literature Association was in dire need of a young leader like Dr. Mishra. He put in a new column of energy to the Association and opened branches in all the States. Shastri ji obtained the services of Dr. Mandan Mishra from the Government of Rajasthan for his great task and appointed him as a permanent Director of the Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri Sanskrit Vidhyapeetha. World Sanskrit Century plan was commissioned under his direction and that gave rise to a new era of Sanskrit in the country. An historical session of all India Sanskrit Literature Association could also be materialised in Calcutta in 1961, which was inaugurated by the first President of India Dr. Rajendra Prasad, due to his noble efforts and initiative. This session came out as a milestone for the development of Sanskrit and concluded with the noble decision of establishing a Sanskrit Vidyapeetha in New Delhi. On the insistence of Dr. Rajendra Prasad eminent personalities like the then chairperson of the association Shri Narahari Vishnu, Governor of Punjab, Shri Balawant Nagesh Dattar, Minister of State for Home, Government of India, Shri Shanti Prasad, a great Industrialist etc. sought the services of Dr. Mishra in New Delhi from Government of Rajasthan as a result of which he came to Delhi and founded Sanskrit Vidyapeetha in New Delhi in 1962. There was no provision of providing assistance to Sanskrit Institutions during that time. Each Institution would then be getting a maximum of Rs. 1000/- as assistance per annum from Delhi Government. With Dr. Mishra's noble effort, Delhi administration decided to extend 95% assistance to all the Sanskrit Institutions. As a result of which, each Sanskrit Institution today is getting lakhs of rupees as assistance from Government. Dr. Mishra took with himself the confidence of all the institutions simultaneously along with him. Fortunately Prime Minister of India Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri accepted the chairmanship of All India Sanskrit Literature Association and Dr Mishra was again elected as its Minister-in- Chief. On a request from Shri Shastriji, Dr. Mishra do away with the desire of an imminent foreseeable power in politics which would otherwise be bestowed upon him on the basis of his 17 years of selfless Service in Rajasthan and the reputation he had won amongst social sectors and public at large and dedicated his entire life for Sanskrit. After unexpected demise of Shri Shastriji, with Dr. Mishra's effort and request from Dr. Sampurnanandaji, Smt. Indira Gandhi took over as President of the Association and Vidyapeetha and in the honour of Shri Shastri he renamed the Vidyapeetha as Lal Bahadur Shastri Sanskrit Vidyapeetha and dedicated it to the Government of India. Dr. Mishra remained the founder director of the Institution. His consistent efforts bring in Delhi Vidyapeetha adequate progress and it became a deemed university in 1989. On 23 June 1989 the Government appointed Dr. Mishra as its first Vice-Chancellor. He started his life's journey from an evening school and got his first retirement as vice-chancellor in June 1994 and again Uttar Pradesh Administration appointed Dr. Mishra as vice-chancellor of Sampurnananda Sanskrit University, Varanasi on 1 January 1996 which glorifies Dr. Mishra's personality. More than three years of his tenure there would remain remarkable in history of the University forever. He conducted timely examinations, regular sessions, publication of 115 books, completion of Saraswati temple and its enlighten ceremony, conducting two religious observance ceremony in the presence of two presidents of India, Shri Sankar Dayal Sharma and Shri K. R. Narayanan as chief guests are rare incidents in the history of the University. Dr. Murli Manohar Joshi's presence was also remarkable there. Dr. Mishra founded Shri Pattaviram Shastri Veda Mimansa Research Centre in Varanasi paying as a homage to popular master sheer Acharya Shri Pattaviram Shastri that is in operation from a newly constructed grand building in Varanasi. Kanchi Sankaracharya also nominated him as the founder chairman of the centre.  Passing  He died serving the Rajasthan Government as Vice-Chancellor, Rajasthan Sanskrit University.

Often referred to as the prototype to the Gloster Grebe, the Grouse originally built as an experimental aircraft and then later developed as a trainer. Despite its compact design and maneuverability, the Grouse was not in itself a commercial success, although it formed the basis for the Gloster Grebe and Gamecock fighters which were used by Britain's Royal Air Force into the 1930s. Design and development The design of the Gloster Grouse was an experiment to combine the advantages of the monoplane with those of a biplane. It was designed by English aviation engineer and aircraft designer Henry Folland, the designer of the S.E.5 among other aircraft. The top wing had a thick, high lift aerofoil, while the bottom wing was smaller, with a thinner medium lift aerofoil set at a smaller angle of attack than the upper wing. This arrangement was meant to produce high lift for take-off with low drag.James 1971, p.89. To test this arrangement, new wings were fitted to a modified Gloster Sparrowhawk fuselage to produce the Gloster Grouse. The resulting aircraft was a small biplane with single bay wooden wings. The fuselage was rather short, and while the aircraft used the fuselage of a two- seat Sparrowhawk II, the forward cockpit was faired over, leaving a single seat for the pilot in an open cockpit. The Grouse retained the Bentley BR2 rotary engine of the Sparrowhawk driving a two blade propeller. The prototype Grouse Mk I (registration G-EAYN) first flew in 1923,Jackson 1973, p.335. proving during testing that Folland's theories were correct. After evaluation by the RAF, orders were placed for three fighter derivatives, to be powered by Armstrong Siddeley Jaguar radial engines, designated Gloster Grebe.James 1971, pp. 90-91. In 1924, Gloster rebuilt the Grouse into a two-seat basic trainer, the Grouse II, powered by an Armstrong Siddeley Lynx radial to replace the RAFs aging Avro 504s, emerging in this form in 1925.James 1971, p.72. Operational history The Grouse II was unsuccessful in meeting the RAF's needs, a new version of the Avro 504, the 504N, also powered by the Lynx engine, being preferred. The Swedish Army Aviation Company purchased the Grouse II prototype as an advanced trainer. The aircraft was delivered just a short time before the Swedish Air Force was founded in the summer of 1926. During its time in Sweden, it only flew 109 hours. The pilots were impressed with the good performance of the aircraft, but no more Gloster Grouses were provided to the Air Force.

It may be innate, assumed or reactive. Etymology Engraving after Pieter Breughel the Elder, 1556. caption: Al rijst den esele ter scholen om leeren, ist eenen esele hij en zal gheen peert weder keeren (\\"Even if the Ass travels to school to learn, as a horse he will not return\\") The root word stupid, which can serve as an adjective or noun, comes from the Latin verb stupere, for being numb or astonished, and is related to stupor. In Roman culture, the stupidus was the professional fall guy in the theatrical mimes. According to the online Merriam-Webster dictionary, the words \\"stupid\\" and \\"stupidity\\" entered the English language in 1541. Since then, stupidity has taken place along with \\"fool,\\" \\"idiot,\\" \\"dumb,\\" \\"moron,\\" and related concepts as a pejorative for misdeeds, whether purposeful or accidental, due to absence of mental capacity. Definition Stupidity is a quality or state of being stupid, or an act or idea that exhibits properties of being stupid. In a character study of \\"The Stupid Man\\" attributed to the Greek philosopher Theophrastus (c. 371 ‚Äì c. 287 BC), stupidity was defined as \\"mental slowness in speech or action\\". The modern English word \\"stupid\\" has a broad range of application, from being slow of mind (indicating a lack of intelligence, care or reason), dullness of feeling or sensation (torpidity, senseless, insensitivity), or lacking interest or point (vexing, exasperating). It can either imply a congenital lack of capacity for reasoning, or a temporary state of daze, or slow- mindedness. In Understanding Stupidity, James F. Welles defines stupidity this way: \\"The term may be used to designate a mentality which is considered to be informed, deliberate and maladaptive.\\" Welles distinguishes stupidity from ignorance; one must know they are acting in their own worst interest. Secondly, it must be a choice, not a forced act or accident. Lastly, it requires the activity to be maladaptive, in that it is in the worst interest of the actor, and specifically done to prevent adaption to new data or existing circumstances.\\" Playing stupid Eric Berne described the game of \\"Stupid\\" as having \\"the thesis...'I laugh with you at my own clumsiness and stupidity.'\\"Eric Berne, Games People Play (Penguin 1968) p. 138 He points out that the player has the advantage of lowering other people's expectations, and so evading responsibility and work; but that he or she may still come through under pressure, like the proverbially stupid younger son.Berne, p. 138-9 Wilfred Bion considered that psychological projection created a barrier against learning anything new, and thus its own form of pseudo- stupidity.Salman Akhtar, Comprehensive Dictionary of Psychoanalysis (2010) \\"Arrogance\\" Intellectual stupidity Otto Fenichel maintained that \\"quite a percentage of so-called feeble-mindedness turns out to be pseudo-debility, conditioned by inhibition ... Every intellect begins to show weakness when affective motives are working against it\\".Otto Fenichel, The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis (London 1946) p. 180 He suggests that \\"people become stupid ad hoc, that is, when they do not want to understand, where understanding would cause anxiety or guilt feeling, or would endanger an existing neurotic equilibrium.\\"Fenichel, p. 181 In rather different fashion, Doris Lessing argued that \\"there is no fool like an intellectual ... a kind of clever stupidity, bred out of a line of logic in the head, nothing to do with experience.\\"Doris Lessing, Under my Skin (London 1994) p. 122 Persisting in folly In the Romantic reaction to Enlightenment wisdom, a valorisation of the irrational, the foolish, and the stupid emerged, as in William Blake's dictum that \\"if the fool would persist in his folly he would become wise\\";William Blake, The Marriage of Heaven and Hell (London 1927) p. 7 or Jung's belief that \\"it requires no art to become stupid; the whole art lies in extracting wisdom from stupidity. Stupidity is the mother of the wise, but cleverness never.\\"C. G. Jung, Alchemical Studies (1978) p. 180 Similarly, Michel Foucault argued for the necessity of stupidity to re-connect with what our articulate categories exclude, to recapture the alterity of difference.Michel Foucault, Language, Counter-Memory, Practice (1980) p. 188‚Äì90 In culture MAD Magazine to become Alfred E. Neuman), used in an editorial critical of abolishing the poll tax in the American South, with a caption showing the person wants to vote but is too ignorant to understand what voting means  In comedy  The fool or buffoon has been a central character in much comedy. Alford and Alford found that humor based on stupidity was prevalent in \\"more complex\\" societies as compared to some other forms of humor.Finnegan Alford; Richard Alford. A Holo-Cultural Study of Humor. Ethos 9(2), pg 149‚Äì164. Some analysis of Shakespeare's comedy has found that his characters tend to hold mutually contradictory positions; because this implies a lack of careful analysis it indicates stupidity on their part.N Frye. A Natural Perspective: The Development of Shakespearean Comedy and Romance. Columbia University Press, 1995. Today there is a wide array of television shows that showcase stupidity such as The Simpsons.R Hobbs. The Simpsons Meet Mark Twain: Analyzing Popular Media Texts in the Classroom. The English Journal, 1998. Goofball comedy is a class of naive, zany humour typified by actor Leslie Nielsen. ‚Äì Paul Gross.Once More to the Well of Goofball Comedy, New York Times In literature The first book in English on stupidity was A Short Introduction to the History of Stupidity by Walter B. Pitkin (1932): According to In Search of Stupidity: Over Twenty Years of High Tech Marketing Disasters, (2003) by Merrill R. Chapman: \\"While In Search of Excellence turned out to be a fraud, In Search of Stupidity is genuine, and no names have been changed to protect the guilty,\\" according to one reviewer. In film Stupidity was a 2003 movie directed by Albert Nerenberg. It depicted examples and analyses of stupidity in modern society and media, and sought \\"to explore the prospect that willful ignorance has increasingly become a strategy for success in the realms of politics and entertainment.\\" Idiocracy, a Mike Judge film from 2006, explored a dystopian future America where a person of average IQ is cryogenically frozen and wakes up 500 years later to find that mankind, increasingly dependent on technology built by previous generations that it does not properly maintain or understand, has regressed in intelligence to the standards of current-era mental retardation, and that he has become the de facto smartest person on Earth.

These programs span the public, private, and non-profit sectors, and all have the goal of increasing energy efficiency and the sustainability of the built environment. Sustainable Design Organizations and Green Building Programs In the United States, governments and private organizations have established several sustainable design organizations and programs in green building. The U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) is a non-profit trade organization that promotes sustainability in how buildings are designed, built and operated. The USGBC is best known for the development of the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system and Greenbuild, a green building conference that promotes the green building industry. As of September 2008, USGBC has more than 17,000 member organizations from every sector of the building industry and works to promote buildings that are environmentally responsible, profitable and healthy places to live and work. To achieve this it has developed a variety of programs and services, and works closely with key industry and research organizations and federal, state and local government agencies. USGBC also offers a host of educational opportunities, including workshops and Web-based seminars to educate the public and industry professionals on different elements of the green building industry, from the basics to more technical information. Through its Green Building Certification Institute, USGBC offers industry professionals the chance to develop expertise in the field of green building and to receive accreditation as green building professionals. The General Services Administration, an independent establishment and government corporation under the Federal Government, builds, manages, and preserves government buildings and leases and manages commercial real estate. GSA works to ensure that the important and complex mandates and standards for federal buildings are understood and followed. Many of these requirements require improving building efficiency and sustainability by applying green technology and practices to operations and management services. The National Association of Home Builders, a trade association representing home builders, remodelers and suppliers to the industry, has created a voluntary residential green building program known as NAHBGreen.NAHBGreen - National Green Building Program  national green building standard certification nahb research center program homes residential builders remodelers scoring tool co... The program includes an online scoring tool, national certification, industry education, and training for local verifiers. The online scoring tool is free to builders and to homeowners. The Green Building Initiative is a non-profit network of building industry leaders working to mainstream building approaches that are environmentally progressive, but also practical and affordable for builders to implement. The GBI has developed a web-based rating tool called Green Globes, which has been upgraded in accordance with ANSI procedures. The United States Environmental Protection Agency's Energy Star program rates commercial buildings for energy efficiency and provides Energy Star qualifications for new homes that meet its standards for energy efficient building design. The Collaborative for High Performance Schools is a non-profit green rating program specifically for K-12 schools. Green Technology. CHPS addresses energy efficiency and additional design considerations fostering healthy and environmentally responsible school buildings. On June 4, 2008, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the \\"21st Century Green High-Performing Public School Facilities Act,\\" which would commit over $20 billion of funding over the next five years to high performance schools. eSchool News CHPS is recognized as one of the standards that projects would need to meet in order to qualify for the H.R. 3021 legislation funding. H.R. 3021 was referred to the Senate on August 1, 2008.http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:h.r.03021: THOMAS Library of Congress. The Green Communities Initiative provided the first national green building program for new constructions and rehabilitation of affordable housing. It was launched in 2004 as a partnership between initiative taker Enterprise Community Partners (ECP), the Natural Resources Defense Council, Global Green USA, the American Institute of Architects, the American Planning Association, Southface and the National Center for Healthy Housing, along with a number of corporate, financial and philanthropic institutions. Enterprise Community Partners first committed to $555 million in grants, financing and equity to bring green affordable housing to the mainstream. ECP launched the \\"next generation\\" Green Communities in 2009 thereby committing to an additional $4 billion. The Green Communities Initiative created the Green Communities Criteria which address eight areas for green building projects and are compatible with LEED standards. Campus greening Transformative work on American college campuses in the 2000s has done much to change the implicit evaluation of \\"progress\\" that green building attracts amongst academics. According to Ann Rappaport, a lecturer at Tufts School of Engineering who writes about climate change and universities, \\"[t]he value of campus greening [in the United States] goes well beyond resources saved; greening generates interest and invites members of the academic community to think differently about societal values, goods consumed, and the infrastructure for shelter and mobility, raising questions about how human needs can be met in new ways.\\"  Federal High-Performance Green Buildings  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 has made available not less than $4.5 billion for measures necessary to convert General Services Administration facilities to High- Performance Green Buildings, as defined in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (Public Law 110-140).  Green Affordable Housing  Green Affordable Housing is affordable housing that exhibits \\"green\\" or \\"sustainable\\" features. Several state and local governments have adopted programs that encourage or require building green when constructing affordable housing. Mixed-income housing developer McCormack Baron Salazar was the first developer in the world to have received two U.S. Green Building Council LEED for Neighborhood Development (LEED-ND) Certifications for completed neighborhoods University Place, in Memphis, Tennessee and Renaissance Place in St. Louis, MO. Both are urban, mixed-income, affordable developments built under the Department of Housing and Urban Development‚Äôs HOPE VI program.Developer Achieves Sustainable Development Distinction Unique in Development Industry , press release, May 6, 2011.  State and local initiatives   California  The 2010 California Green Building Standards Code(Calgreen) is the first statewide green building code in the country and seeks to establish minimum green building standards for the majority of residential and commercial new construction projects across California. San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom approved a green building ordinance in early August 2008 that imposes strict requirements on newly constructed residential and commercial buildings within the city, as well as building renovations.EERE News: EERE Network News - September 3, 2008 For homes, the ordinance requires ratings from the GreenPoints rating system, developed by a non-profit organization called Build It Green. Starting next year, new \\"small\\" residential buildings (those with four dwellings or fewer) must achieve 25 GreenPoints (equal to the \\"Elements\\" rating), but do not need to be rated. For 2010 and 2011, the homes must be GreenPoint Rated and building applications must demonstrate that a minimum of 50 GreenPoints (equal to the \\"Whole House\\" rating) will be achieved. And starting in 2012, building applications for new homes must demonstrate that at least 75 GreenPoints will be achieved. The same rules apply for mid-size residential buildings, except that the requirement for 75 GreenPoints starts earlier, in 2011. For commercial buildings and high- rise residential buildings, the ordinance adds in requirements from the U.S. Green Building Council's LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) rating system. Starting in November (if the California Energy Commission has approved the legislation), new permit applications for high-rise residential buildings must include documentation to achieve LEED certification (or 50 GreenPoints), and starting in 2010, they must include documentation to achieve LEED Silver certification (or 75 GreenPoints). A number of specific LEED standards must also be met for landscaping, water use reduction, and construction debris management. Mid-size commercial buildings don't need to meet LEED certification requirements but must meet LEED standards for building commissioning, landscaping, water use, and construction debris management starting in 2009, and must meet enhanced commissioning standards and tighter water use requirements starting in 2010. Beginning in 2012, the buildings must also meet LEED standards for the use of on-site renewable energy or the purchase of renewable energy credits. The toughest requirements apply to large commercial buildings. Starting in November, new permit applications for high- rise residential building must submit documentation to achieve LEED certification, and that requirement ratchets up to LEED Silver in 2009 and LEED Gold in 2012. There are also requirements to meet additional LEED standards, nearly equal to those for mid-size commercial buildings. Finally, for new large commercial interiors and major alterations to existing buildings, new permit applications must include documentation to achieve the same LEED rating requirements as for new large commercial buildings, and must also meet the LEED standards for materials that emit low levels of indoor pollutants. All new buildings must earn additional rating points if an older building was demolished to make room for it, and they must earn even higher points if the demolished building was historical. Building projects can also earn extra points by retaining historical features of the previous building. Earning LEED credits within this framework is becoming cost neutral for most hotel developers, especially in the Napa Valley where the industry has caught up to speed. Since at least March 2008, green property builders have been giving them \\"real figures on what it costs to build a green property\\" after developer tax incentives.

Overview Green building as a process that incorporates environmental considerations into every aspect of the home building process ‚Äì from choosing the lot and the house plan to material selection construction of the home and finally, its maintenance and operation. What constitutes \\"green\\" construction will vary according to the climate, geography and market preferences of the community in which the home will be built. NAHB members have been building green homes for years ‚Äì each one appropriate to the climate, geography and market preferences of the communities where they build. Additionally, these builders certified more than 115,000 homes in local HBA green building programs between 1995 and 2008. These programs have transformed the market because they are a cooperative effort among builders, designers, environmentalists and elected officials. Green building thrives when builders, developers and remodelers can go green voluntarily, without mandates and overbearing strictures. When that happens, there‚Äôs no limit on how green a home can be. The NAHB National Green Building Program has several component parts: *National Green Building Certification to the National Green Building Standard and the NAHB Model Green Home Building Guidelines *The Certified Green Professional educational designation *The NAHB National Green Building Conference *The NAHB National Green Building Awards NAHBGreen homes and projects can come in all sizes, styles and price points ‚Äì from starter homes to retirement villas. Each one incorporates the hallmarks of green building ‚Äì energy, water, and resource efficiency, indoor environmental quality and effective lot design. State and local home builder associations \\"affiliate\\" with NAHBGreen by encouraging their members to seek National Green Building Certification and providing educational opportunities for builders, remodelers and consumers. As of June 2009, there were 102 state and local NAHBGreen affiliates. Working with the International Code Council, NAHB spearheaded the development of the National Green Building Standard for all residential construction and renovation projects. This standard was approved in January 2009 by the American National Standards Institute, making it the benchmark for green homes. The standard development process was the latest in a series of initiatives designed to encourage education, networking and recognition for green builders. The NAHB Green Building Subcommittee was formed in 1998 and the annual NAHB Green Building Conference was first held in 1999, when the first NAHB National Green Building Awards were given to a select group of builders, remodelers and advocates for their exemplary progress. In 2005, NAHB introduced the NAHB Model Green Home Building Guidelines, allowing builders to \\"score\\" their projects in seven categories: energy efficiency, water efficiency, resource efficiency, indoor environmental quality, global impact, lot and site development and homeowner education. To score a home, builders had to achieve a minimum number of points in each of the seven categories and additional points in the categories of choice. The more points a project achieved across all categories, the higher the level. In 2006, NAHB introduced the two-day \\"Green Building for Building Professionals\\" class. Home builders, remodelers, designers and suppliers immediately filled sessions held in home building associations all over the country. National Green Building Certification There are two rating systems available to score green projects: The NAHB Model Green Building Guidelines for new single-family homes and the National Green Building Standard for new single-family and multifamily construction, residential remodeling and renovation, and subdivision development. Both rating systems are used as design tools for building professionals to plan their green projects. They are also scoring tools, providing the list of green choices made so that inspectors can test and verify the results. Finally, they are used for certification, so that a third party, the NAHB Research Center, can review the inspector's documentation and certify that the project is authentically green. Builders can apply to certify their homes with both the National Green Building Standard and Builders Challenge using the free online Green Scoring Tool. The NAHBGreen website provides instructions for the scoring tools and certification process. A list of accredited verifiers is also provided at the site. The Certified Green Professional designation The Certified Green Professional Nahb.org educational designation helps consumers recognize builders, remodelers and other industry professionals who incorporate green building principles into homes ‚Äî without driving up the cost of construction. Requirements include 24 hours of classroom instruction, two years of industry experience, adherence to a code of ethics and a commitment to approved continuing education sessions. More than 3,400 people have earned their CGPs since February 2008 ‚Äì making it the largest and fastest growing NAHB designation in the history of the University of Housing. Consumers can access a Certified Green Professional at the Builder and Remodeler Online Designation Directory at the program's website. The National Green Building Conference The annual National Green Building Conference Nahb.org features educational seminars focusing on topics including Sales and Marketing, Design, Project Management and Building Science. A Tour of Green Homes includes new single-family homes and remodeling projects in various stages of construction. You can become a fan of the NAHB National Green Building Conference on Facebook or Linkedin and share your thoughts on green with these online communities. The National Green Building Awards The National Green Building Awards Nahb.org focus upon innovative design and technology, and there is also a special category for affordable green homes.

Perched high on the banks of the Yarra River at Yarra Bend in the inner Melbourne suburb of Fairfield, it developed an international reputation for the research and treatment of infectious diseases. When it closed, it was the last specific infectious diseases hospital in Australia. Initially the hospital was devoted to the treatment of patients with fevers. Diseases treated included typhoid, diphtheria, cholera, smallpox, poliomyelitis and scarlet fever, and in its final years, HIV/AIDS became very prominent. Site and planning In the 1860s, the colony of Victoria was rife with diseases such as diphtheria, typhoid, smallpox and scarlet fever. At the time, Melbourne had two general hospitals, Melbourne and Alfred and three specialist hospitals, Lying-In, Children's and Eye and Ear. These five hospitals were unable to cope with the annual bouts of infectious diseases which recurred frequently. The Colonial Government began discussing the idea of constructing a hospital to treat patients with infectious diseases. Two sites were considered, one at Yarra Bend and another further along Heidelberg Road. Yarra Bend was the preferred location however the local residents protested and the proposal was dropped. Plans for an infectious diseases hospital were again considered in 1874 however no significant moves were made until 1897, the year of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee. Queen Victoria had made it know that any funds raised to celebrate her Jubilee should be used to help the sick. By November 1897, ¬£16 000 was raised by municipal levies. The government granted of land at Yarra Bend, due north of the Yarra Bend Asylum. Tenders were listed in 1900 for the hospital's first buildings and construction was completed in 1901. Unfortunately all of the funds had been consumed by building the hospital and further money had to be sourced to furnish the buildings and employ staff. Early years In 1904 the hospital opened its doors. Funds for operating the hospital were drawn from Melbourne, Fitzroy, Richmond, St. Kilda, Brunswick and Coburg councils. Each council contributed to the upkeep of the hospital and in return they had a seat on the Hospital Board and their ratepayers were treated free of charge. Other councils were required to pay for any of their residents who required the use of the hospital. Six patients were admitted to the hospital during its first week, one of whom died. This was a public scandal as the child who died was from Northcote and there had been a delay in admitting him whilst the Town Clerk of Northcote debated who was to pay for the boy's hospital fees. Because of public disquiet about the running of the hospital, an inquiry was held in 1912. This led to a 1914 Act of Parliament, which established a board of management. In 1915 the board was further expanded with Northcote and Preston joining the board. All councils now contributed to the upkeep of the hospital as well as receiving funding from the State Government. Spanish Influenza Victorian Spanish Influenza precautions leafletIn 1918 Melbourne and Sydney's ports were placed under quarantine in an attempt to avoid the introduction into Australia of the Spanish Influenza epidemic which was claiming thousands of lives around the world. While the quarantine had some effect in limiting the introduction of the disease to Australia, the first cases were eventually diagnosed and patients were hospitalised, causing a sharp rise in intake figures. Fairfield Hospital's intake of patients had remained stable until 1918-1920; during these years the intake jumped to 6000 patients a year, which would remain the average until the late 1980s. Polio epidemic In the late 1930s, Australia was struck by an epidemic of poliomyelitis. All acute cases were sent to Queen's Memorial Hospital and Medical Superintendent Dr F.V.G. Scholes, set aside 230 beds for polio patients. 1275 polio patients were admitted between July 1937 and July 1938. Most were less than 14 years old, 140 had respiratory paralysis and 106 required respirator treatment in an iron lung. Seventy seven of these patients died and many were permanently disabled. Prior to the 1937 epidemic, the hospital had only one iron lung, a 'Drinker' respirator. It had been imported from London to treat the occasional case of diphtheritic paralysis, a partial paralysis that may follow diphtheria, affecting the soft palate and throat muscles. With the onset of the 1937 epidemic, more respirators were urgently required. Six new wooden respirators were developed and installed by Aubrey Burstall, the Professor of Engineering at the University of Melbourne, with 23 more to follow shortly after. During the height of the epidemic, up to 47 patients were using the hospital's 30 respirators on a 'time share' basis. Further polio epidemics in 1947-48 and 1951-52 saw more patients sent to Fairfield for treatment and rehabilitation. The discovery of Salk vaccine and Sabin vaccine in the 1950s saw polio virtually eradicated from Australia. Fairfield Hospital After the Second World War, the mass production of penicillin and other antibiotics enabled a decline in several infectious diseases. As a result, in 1948 new legislation enabled the hospital to treat general medical and surgical patients, and the Queen's Memorial Hospital was renamed Fairfield Hospital. In 1959 Vivian Bullwinkel was appointed Matron of Fairfield Infectious Diseases Hospital. After her retirement in 1977, she was honoured with The Vivian Bullwinkel School of Nursing being opened at Fairfield Hospital in September 1978.Vivian Bullwinkel: an Australian heroine - timeline accessed Feb 14, 2010 Burnet Institute A virology laboratory was established at Fairfield Hospital in 1950 to undertake clinical, diagnostic and research services for the many patients with viral infections. Under the guidance of Dr Alan Ferris (1950‚Äì1970) and Professor Ian Gust (1970‚Äì1990), Fairfield gained a worldwide reputation for education, research and treatment. The laboratory was the first to isolate hepatitis A virus and one of the first strains of respiratory syncytial virus (the A2 strain, now a reference A group virus). With the emergence of the HIV virus in Australia in the early 1980s, Fairfield Hospital and its virology laboratory became one of the primary centres for patient care, diagnostic services, public health reference and research into AIDS in Australia. During this period it was suggested that the virology research functions should be transferred to a more independently managed research centre within Fairfield Hospital. In 1983, Sir Frank Macfarlane Burnet became the founding patron of the new research centre. Macfarlane Burnet, a Nobel Laureate had been appointed Honorary Consultant Epidemiologist at Fairfield Hospital in 1946, a position he held until his death in 1985. Following his death, Professor Gust and the Burnet family agreed that the virology research centre should be named the Macfarlane Burnet Centre for Medical Research (later changed to the Macfarlane Burnet Institute for Medical Research and Public Health), in honour of Sir Frank. The Burnet Institute continued to operate on the grounds of Fairfield Hospital up until the hospital's closure. HIV/AIDS In November 1982, the first case of AIDS was diagnosed at St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney. By mid 1983 AIDS was declared a notifiable disease in Victoria and Dr Ron Lucas, seconded to the CDC from Fairfield Hospital recommended that Fairfield staff warn the homosexual community of the impending illness. In November 1983, Fairfield's Professor Ian Gust began a collaboration with Dr Luc Montagnier of the Pasteur Institute in Paris to develop tests to detect HIV infection. As a result of their success, the Fairfield Hospital Laboratory began regular testing of Australian blood products in 1984, several months before the rest of the world. The first patient with AIDS was admitted to Fairfield Hospital in April 1984. In October 1984 the first AIDS outpatients clinic at Fairfield Hospital opened on Friday afternoons. Twenty five percent of initial patients were found to be HIV+. During the late 1980s, admission rates to soared to 10,000 a year, as HIV infection rates continue to increase. In 1990 researchers from Fairfield Hospital published findings from two of their studies about HIV resistance to the drug AZT during treatment. Their studies showed that some people with HIV who took AZT developed resistance to the drug and then lost that resistance when treatment was stopped. They suggested that three or more drugs are needed to be used together to treat HIV effectively (also known as combination therapy). Fairfield Hospital continued to offer care and treatment for patients with HIV and AIDS into the 1990s. In 1991, large public protests were organised against the possible closure of the hospital. However, by 1996 the majority of the hospital's HIV services had been relocated to The Alfred and Royal Melbourne Hospitals and Fairfield Hospital ceased operations. AIDS Memorial Garden In the mid 1980s, the Victorian AIDS Council and the management of Fairfield Hospital proposed the establishment of a garden and walk for the use of Fairfield Hospital patients and their families, particularly those with HIV. An area of river frontage owned by Collingwood Council was initially proposed, however it was eventually decided that a site on hospital grounds was more appropriate. Construction began 1987 with materials and professional services provided by volunteers, donators, the Victorian AIDS Council, Northcote City Council and Fairfield Hospital. The garden featured several Victorian style garden seats which were donated by families who had lost members through AIDS, a gazebo, rockeries and plantings of local indigenous plants and was opened on April 9, 1988. The garden fell into disrepair following the closure of Fairfield Hospital. As part of the agreement to purchase the bulk of the former hospital's site, NMIT accepted responsibility for the care and maintenance of the garden. However, when construction workers found vials of infectious diseases such as E. coli in the adjacent Yarra House, a strike was called and work on Yarra House (and the memorial garden) ceased. Initial intentions were that the garden not be a memorial but instead an area of respite and reflection. Closure and redevelopment In September 1991 the Report of the Reviews of Infectious Diseases in Victoria recommended the relocation of HIV/AIDS services to The Alfred Hospital. Other infectious disease patients were to be cared for by the Royal Melbourne Hospital. In the 1990s, the Victorian Liberal Government of Jeff Kennett pursued the rationalisation of hospital services. Despite strong protests, the specialised functions of the hospital were transferred to other hospitals and on 30 June 1996 Fairfield Infectious Diseases Hospital closed. Since closure in 1996 most of the hospital site has been redeveloped. The northern portion of the site including the majority of the hospital buildings were sold to NMIT. Redevelopment of the site was halted in September 2001 when workers found vials of E. coli and other bacteria in the ceiling of one of the buildings. This resulted in industrial action, which was later addressed. Many of the remaining buildings have been adapted for use by Melbourne Polytechnic, then known as NMIT. Also using part of the site is the Disability Forensic Assessment and Treatment Service, operated by the Department of Human Services. The Victorian Institute of Forensic Mental Health, Thomas Embling Hospital occupies the southern portion of the site, adjacent to the area formerly occupied by Fairlea Women's Prison.

It comprises the eastern half of the island of Timor, the nearby islands of Atauro and Jaco, and Oecusse, an exclave on the northwestern side of the island surrounded by Indonesian West Timor. Australia is the country's southern neighbour, separated by the Timor Sea. The country's size is about 15,007 km (5,794 sq mi). East Timor was colonised by Portugal in the 16th century and was known as Portuguese Timor until 28 November 1975, when the Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor (Fretilin) declared the territory's independence. Nine days later, it was invaded and occupied by the Indonesian military; it was declared Indonesia's 27th province the following year. The Indonesian occupation of East Timor was characterised by a highly violent, decades-long conflict between separatist groups (especially Fretilin) and the Indonesian military. In 1999, following the United Nations-sponsored act of self-determination, Indonesia relinquished control of the territory. As \\"Timor-Leste\\", it became the first new sovereign state of the 21st century on 20 May 2002 and joined the United Nations and the Community of Portuguese Language Countries. In 2011, East Timor announced its intention to become the eleventh member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).East Timor Bid to Join ASEAN Wins 'Strong Support', Bangkok Post, date: 31 January 2011. It is one of only two predominantly Christian nations in Southeast Asia, the other being the Philippines, as well as the only country of Asia to be located completely in the Southern Hemisphere. Etymology \\"Timor\\" is derived from timur, the word for \\"east\\" in Malay, which became recorded as Timor in Portuguese, thus resulting in the tautological toponym meaning \\"East East\\": In Portuguese Timor-Leste (Leste being the word for \\"east\\"); in Tetum Tim√≥r Lorosa'e (Lorosa'e being the word for \\"east\\" (literally \\"rising sun\\")). In Indonesian, the country is called Timor Timur, thereby using the Portuguese name for the island followed by the word for \\"east\\", as adjectives in Indonesian are put after the noun. The official names under the Constitution are Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste in English, Rep√∫blica Democr√°tica de Timor-Leste in Portuguese, and Rep√∫blika Demokr√°tika Tim√≥r-Leste in Tetum. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) official short form in English and all other languages is Timor-Leste (codes: TLS & TL), which has been adopted by the United Nations, the European Union, and the national standards organisations of France (AFNOR), the United States (ANSI), United Kingdom (BSI), Germany (DIN), and Sweden (SIS), all diplomatic missions to the country by protocol and the CIA World Factbook.  History  Prehistory Cultural remains at Jerimalai on the eastern tip of East Timor have been dated to 42,000 years ago, making that location one of the oldest known sites of modern human activity in Maritime Southeast Asia. Descendants of at least three waves of migration are believed still to live in East Timor. The first is described by anthropologists as people of the Veddo-Australoid type. Around 3000 BC, a second migration brought Melanesians. The earlier Veddo-Australoid peoples withdrew at this time to the mountainous interior. Finally, proto- Malays arrived from south China and north Indochina. Hakka traders are among those descended from this final group. Timorese origin myths tell of ancestors who sailed around the eastern end of Timor arriving on land in the south. Some stories recount Timorese ancestors journeying from the Malay Peninsula or the Minangkabau highlands of Sumatra. Austronesians migrated to Timor, and are thought to be associated with the development of agriculture on the island. Classical era Before European colonialism, Timor was included in Indonesian/Malaysian, Chinese and Indian trading networks, and in the 14th century was an exporter of aromatic sandalwood, slaves, honey, and wax. From the 1500s, the Timorese people had military ties with the Lu√ß√µes of present- day northern Philippines.Pigafetta, Antonio (1969) [1524]. \\"First voyage around the world\\". Translated by J.A. Robertson. Manila: Filipiniana Book Guild.The former sultan of Malacca decided to retake his city from the Portuguese with a fleet of ships from Lusung in 1525 A.D., SOURCE: Barros, Joao de, Decada terciera de Asia de Ioano de Barros dos feitos que os Portugueses fezarao no descubrimiento dos mares e terras de Oriente [1628], Lisbon, 1777, courtesy of William Henry Scott, Barangay: Sixteenth-Century Philippine Culture and Society, Quezon City: Ateneo de Manila University Press, 1994, page 194. It was the relative abundance of sandalwood in Timor that attracted European explorers to the island in the early 16th century. At around that time, European explorers reported that the island had a number of small chiefdoms or princedoms. Arms of Portuguese Timor (1935‚Äì1975) Colonial era =Portuguese period (1769‚Äì1975)= The Portuguese established outposts in Timor and Maluku. Effective European occupation of a small part of present-day East Timor began in 1769 when the city of Dili was founded and the colony of Portuguese Timor declared. A definitive border between the Dutch-colonised western half of the island and the Portuguese- colonised eastern half was established by the Permanent Court of Arbitration of 1914, and it remains the international boundary between the successor states Indonesia and East Timor, respectively. For the Portuguese, East Timor remained little more than a neglected trading post until the late nineteenth century, with minimal investment in infrastructure, health, and education. Sandalwood continued to be the main export crop with coffee exports becoming significant in the mid-nineteenth century. At the beginning of the twentieth century, a faltering home economy prompted the Portuguese to extract greater wealth from its colonies, which was met with East Timorese resistance. Jos√© Ramos-Horta, 1996 Nobel Peace Prize winner, second President of East TimorDuring World War II, first the Allies and later the Japanese occupied Dili, and the mountainous interior of the colony became the scene of a guerrilla campaign, known as the Battle of Timor. Waged by East Timorese volunteers and Allied forces against the Japanese, the struggle resulted in the deaths of between 40,000 and 70,000 East Timorese. Access date: 3 January 2007. The Japanese eventually drove the last of the Australian and Allied forces out. However, Portuguese control was reinstated after the Japanese surrender at the end of World War II. Following the 1974 Portuguese revolution, Portugal effectively abandoned its colony in Timor and civil war between East Timorese political parties broke out in 1975. The Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor (Fretilin) resisted a Timorese Democratic Union (UDT) coup attempt in August 1975, and unilaterally declared independence on 28 November 1975. Fearing a communist state within the Indonesian archipelago, the Indonesian military launched an invasion of East Timor in December 1975.Jardine, pp. 50‚Äì51. Indonesia declared East Timor its 27th province on 17 July 1976. The UN Security Council opposed the invasion and the territory's nominal status in the UN remained as \\"non-self-governing territory under Portuguese administration\\". independence from Indonesia held in Australia during September 1999 =Indonesian occupation (1975‚Äì1999)= Indonesia's occupation of East Timor was marked by violence and brutality. A detailed statistical report prepared for the Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation in East Timor cited a minimum of 102,800 conflict-related deaths in the period 1974‚Äì1999, namely, approximately 18,600 killings and 84,200 \\"excess\\" deaths from hunger and illness, with an estimated figure based on Portuguese, Indonesian and Catholic Church data of approximately 200,000 deaths. The East Timorese guerrilla force (For√ßas Armadas da Liberta√ß√£o Nacional de Timor-Leste, Falintil) fought a campaign against the Indonesian forces from 1975 to 1998. The 1991 Dili Massacre was a turning point for the independence cause and an East Timor solidarity movement grew in Portugal, the Philippines, Australia, and other Western countries. Following the resignation of Indonesian President Suharto, an UN-sponsored agreement between Indonesia and Portugal allowed for an UN-supervised popular referendum in August 1999. A clear vote for independence was met with a punitive campaign of violence by East Timorese pro-integration militia supported by elements of the Indonesian military. This allowed the sending of the multinational peacekeeping force, INTERFET, which was formed by Australia, the Philippines, South Korea, Thailand, and New Zealand, with aid from the United States, to restore order and aid East Timorese refugees and internally-displaced persons. On 25 October 1999, the administration of East Timor was taken over by the UN through the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET), headed by Sergio Vieira de Mello. The INTERFET deployment ended in February 2000 with the transfer of military command to the UN. Contemporary era On 30 August 2001, the East Timorese voted in their first election organised by the UN to elect members of the Constituent Assembly. On 22 March 2002, the Constituent Assembly approved the Constitution. By May 2002, over 205,000 refugees had returned. On 20 May 2002, the Constitution of the Democratic Republic of East Timor came into force and East Timor was recognised as independent by the UN. The Constituent Assembly was renamed the National Parliament and Xanana Gusm√£o was sworn in as the country's first President after Indonesian occupation. On 27 September 2002, East Timor was renamed Timor-Leste, using the Portuguese language, and was admitted as a member state by the UN. In 2006, the United Nations sent in security forces to restore order when unrest and factional fighting forced 15 percent of the population (155,000 people) to flee their homes. The following year, Gusm√£o declined another presidential term, and in the build-up to the mid-year presidential elections there were renewed outbreaks of violence. In those elections, Jos√© Ramos-Horta was elected President. In June 2007, Gusm√£o ran in the parliamentary elections and became Prime Minister. In February 2008, Ramos- Horta was critically injured in an attempted assassination. Prime Minister Gusm√£o also faced gunfire separately but escaped unharmed. Australian reinforcements were immediately sent to help keep order. In March 2011, the UN handed over operational control of the police force to the East Timor authorities. The United Nations ended its peacekeeping mission on 31 December 2012. East Timor became a state party to the UNESCO World Heritage Convention on 31 January 2017. Politics and government Xanana Gusm√£o, the first East Timorese President after Indonesian occupation. The head of state of East Timor is the President of the Republic, who is elected by popular vote for a five-year term. Although the President's executive powers are somewhat limited, he or she does have the power to appoint the Prime Minister and veto government legislation. Following elections, the President usually appoints the leader of the majority party or coalition as Prime Minister of East Timor and the cabinet on the proposal of the latter. As head of government, the Prime Minister presides over the cabinet. Nicolau Lobato Presidential Palace in Dili. The unicameral East Timorese parliament is the National Parliament or Parlamento Nacional, the members of which are elected by popular vote to a five-year term. The number of seats can vary from a minimum of fifty-two to a maximum of sixty-five. The East Timorese constitution was modelled on that of Portugal. The country is still in the process of building its administration and governmental institutions. Government departments include the Pol√≠cia Nacional de Timor-Leste (police), East Timor Ministry for State and Internal Administration, Civil Aviation Division of Timor-Leste, and Immigration Department of Timor-Leste. Administrative divisions The thirteen municipalities of East Timor East Timor is divided into thirteen municipalities, which in turn are subdivided into 65 administrative posts, 442 sucos (villages), and 2,225 aldeias (hamlets). # Oecusse # Liqui√ß√° # Dili # Manatuto # Baucau # Laut√©m # Bobonaro # Ermera # Aileu # Viqueque # Cova Lima # Ainaro # Manufahi Articles 5 and 71 of the 2002 constitution provide that Oecusse be governed by a special administrative policy and economic regime. Law 3/2014 of 18 June 2014 created the Special Administrative Region of Oe- Cusse Ambeno (Regi√£o Administrativa Especial de Oecusse, RAEOA). Foreign relations and military F-FDTL soldiers standing in formation The Casa Europa in Dili, the European Union's representation in East Timor East Timor is a full member state of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries (CPLP), also known as the Lusophone Commonwealth, an international organisation and political association of Lusophone nations across four continents. In each of those nations, Portuguese is an official language. East Timor sought membership in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in 2007, and a formal application was submitted in March 2011. Timor-Leste Defense Forces soldiers in military training Indonesia-East Timor border in Mota'ain The East Timor Defence Force (For√ßas de Defesa de Timor-Leste, F-FDTL) is the military body responsible for the defence of East Timor. The F-FDTL was established in February 2001 and comprised two small infantry battalions, a small naval component, and several supporting units. F-FDTL's primary role is to protect East Timor from external threats. It also has an internal security role, which overlaps with that of the National Police of East Timor (Pol√≠cia Nacional de Timor-Leste, PNTL). This overlap has led to tensions between the services, which have been exacerbated by poor morale and lack of discipline within the F-FDTL. The F-FDTL's problems came to a head in 2006 when almost half the force was dismissed following protests over discrimination and poor conditions. The dismissal contributed to a general collapse of both the F-FDTL and PNTL in May and forced the government to request foreign peacekeepers to restore security. The F-FDTL is being rebuilt with foreign assistance and has drawn up a long-term force development plan. Demonstration against Australia in December 2013 Since the discovery of petroleum in the Timor Sea in the 1970s, there have been disputes surrounding the rights to ownership and exploitation of the resources situated in a part of the Timor Sea known as the Timor Gap, which is the area of the Timor Sea which lies outside the territorial boundaries of the nations to the north and south of the Timor Sea. These disagreements initially involved Australia and Indonesia, although a resolution was eventually reached in the form of the Timor Gap Treaty. After the declaration of East Timor's nationhood in 1999, the terms of the Timor Gap Treaty were abandoned and negotiations commenced between Australia and East Timor, culminating in the Timor Sea Treaty. Australia's territorial claim extended to the bathymetric axis (the line of greatest sea-bed depth) at the Timor Trough. It overlapped East Timor's own territorial claim, which followed the former colonial power Portugal and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea in claiming that the dividing line should be midway between the two countries. It was revealed in 2013 that the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS) planted listening devices to listen to the East Timorese government during negotiations over the Greater Sunrise oil and gas fields. This is known as the Australia‚ÄìEast Timor spying scandal. Geography Located in Southeast Asia, the island of Timor is part of Maritime Southeast Asia, and is the largest and easternmost of the Lesser Sunda Islands. To the north of the island are the Ombai Strait, Wetar Strait, and the greater Banda Sea. The Timor Sea separates the island from Australia to the south, and the Indonesian province of East Nusa Tenggara lies to East Timor's west. The total land size is . East Timor has an exclusive economic zone of .Exclusive Economic Zones ‚Äì Sea Around Us Project ‚Äì Fisheries, Ecosystems & Biodiversity ‚Äì Data and Visualization. Much of the country is mountainous, and its highest point is Tatamailau (also known as Mount Ramelau) at . The climate is tropical and generally hot and humid. It is characterised by distinct rainy and dry seasons. The capital, largest city, and main port is Dili, and the second- largest city is the eastern town of Baucau. East Timor lies between latitudes 8¬∞ and 10¬∞S, and longitudes 124¬∞ and 128¬∞E. alt= The easternmost area of East Timor consists of the Paitchau Range and the Lake Ira Lalaro area, which contains the country's first conservation area, the Nino Konis Santana National Park. It contains the last remaining tropical dry forested area within the country. It hosts a number of unique plant and animal species and is sparsely populated.Norwegian energy and Water Resources Directorate (NVE) (2004), Iralalaro Hydropower Project Environmental Assessment The northern coast is characterised by a number of coral reef systems that have been determined to be at risk. Economy Economy of East Timor (nominal GDP)(previous and data) 226x226px Aileu Shopping mall in Dili alt= The economy of East Timor is a market economy, which used to depend upon exports of a few commodities such as coffee, marble, petroleum, and sandalwood. It grew by about 10% in 2011 and at a similar rate in 2012. East Timor now has revenue from offshore oil and gas reserves, but little of it has been spent on the development of villages, which still rely on subsistence farming. , nearly half the East Timorese population was living in extreme poverty. The Timor- Leste Petroleum Fund was established in 2005, and by 2011 it had reached a worth of US$8.7 billion. East Timor is labelled by the International Monetary Fund as the \\"most oil-dependent economy in the world\\". The Petroleum Fund pays for nearly all of the government's annual budget, which increased from $70 million in 2004 to $1.3 billion in 2011, with a $1.8 billion proposal for 2012. East-Timor's income from oil and gas stands to increase significantly after its cancellation of a controversial agreement with Australia, which gave Australia half of the income from oil and gas from 2006. The country's economy is dependent on government spending and, to a lesser extent, assistance from foreign donors. Private sector development has lagged due to human capital shortages, infrastructure weakness, an incomplete legal system, and an inefficient regulatory environment. After petroleum, the second largest export is coffee, which generates about $10 million a year. Starbucks is a major purchaser of East Timorese coffee. 170x170px 9,000 tonnes of coffee, 108 tonnes of cinnamon and 161 tonnes of cocoa were harvested in 2012 making the country the 40th ranked producer of coffee, the 6th ranked producer of cinnamon and the 50th ranked producer of cocoa worldwide. According to data gathered in the 2010 census, 87.7% of urban (321,043 people) and 18.9% of rural (821,459 people) households have electricity, for an overall average of 38.2%. The agriculture sector employs 80% of East Timor's active population. In 2009, about 67,000 households grew coffee in East Timor, with a large proportion of those households being poor. Currently, the gross margins are about $120 per hectare, with returns per labour-day of about $3.70. There were 11,000 households growing mungbeans as of 2009, most of them by subsistence farming. In the Doing Business 2013 report by the World Bank, East Timor was ranked 169th overall and last in the East Asia and Pacific region. The country fared particularly poorly in the \\"registering property\\", \\"enforcing contracts\\" and \\"resolving insolvency\\" categories, ranking last worldwide in all three. As regards telecommunications infrastructure, East Timor is the second to last ranked Asian country in the World Economic Forum's Network Readiness Index (NRI), with only Myanmar falling behind it in southeast Asia. NRI is an indicator for determining the development level of a country's information and communication technologies. In the 2014 NRI ranking, East Timor ranked number 141 overall, down from 134 in 2013. The Portuguese colonial administration granted concessions to the Australia-bound Oceanic Exploration Corporation to develop petroleum and natural gas deposits in the waters southeast of Timor. However, this was curtailed by the Indonesian invasion in 1976. The resources were divided between Indonesia and Australia with the Timor Gap Treaty in 1989. East Timor inherited no permanent maritime boundaries when it attained independence. A provisional agreement (the Timor Sea Treaty, signed when East Timor became independent on 20 May 2002) defined a Joint Petroleum Development Area (JPDA) and awarded 90% of revenues from existing projects in that area to East Timor and 10% to Australia. An agreement in 2005 between the governments of East Timor and Australia mandated that both countries put aside their dispute over maritime boundaries and that East Timor would receive 50% of the revenues from the resource exploitation in the area (estimated at A$26 billion, or about US$20 billion over the lifetime of the project) from the Greater Sunrise development. In 2013, East Timor launched a case at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague to pull out of a gas treaty that it had signed with Australia, accusing the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS) of bugging the East Timorese cabinet room in Dili in 2004. East Timor is part of the Timor Leste‚ÄìIndonesia‚ÄìAustralia Growth Triangle (TIA-GT). There are no patent laws in East Timor. A railway system has been proposed but the current government has yet to approve the proposal due to lack of funds and expertise. Tourism in East Timor - Ata√∫ro  Tourism  Tourism is still of minor importance in East Timor. In 2017, the country was visited by 75,000 tourists. In the last five years tourism has been increasing and the number of hotels and resorts has increased. The government decided to invest in the expansion of the international airport in Dili. The risk for tourists in East Timor is medium/low, with positive factors being a low crime, the occurrence of zero terrorist attacks in the last decades and road safety. Negative factors for tourists include roads in poor condition, mainly in the interior of the country. Demographics An East Timorese man partially dressed in traditional clothing Population pyramid East Timor demographic change between 1861 and 2010. East Timor recorded a population of 1,183,643 in its 2015 census. The CIA's World Factbook lists the English-language demonym for East Timor as Timorese, as does the Government of Timor-Leste's website. Other reference sources list it as East Timorese. The word Maubere,\\"Maubere\\" article at the German Wikipedia. formerly used by the Portuguese to refer to native East Timorese and often employed as synonymous with the illiterate and uneducated, was adopted by Fretilin as a term of pride. Native East Timorese consist of a number of distinct ethnic groups, most of whom are of mixed Austronesian and Melanesian/Papuan descent. The largest Malayo-Polynesian ethnic groups are the Tetum (100,000), primarily in the north coast and around Dili; the Mambai (80,000), in the central mountains; the Tukudede (63,170), in the area around Maubara and Liqui√ß√°; the Galoli (50,000), between the tribes of Mambae and Makasae; the Kemak (50,000) in north-central Timor island; and the Baikeno (20,000), in the area around Pante Macassar. The main tribes of predominantly Papuan origin include the Bunak (84,000), in the central interior of Timor island; the Fataluku (40,000), at the eastern tip of the island near Lospalos; and the Makasae (70,000), toward the eastern end of the island. As a result of interracial marriage which was common during the Portuguese era, there is a population of people of mixed East Timorese and Portuguese origin, known in Portuguese as mesti√ßos. There is a small Chinese minority, most of whom are Hakka. Many Chinese left in the mid-1970s. Languages Major language groups in East Timor by suco East Timor's two official languages are Portuguese and Tetum. English and Indonesian are sometimes used. Tetum belongs to the Austronesian family of languages spoken throughout Southeast Asia and the Pacific. The 2015 census found that the most commonly spoken mother tongues were Tetum Prasa (mother tongue for 30.6% of the population), Mambai (16.6%), Makasai (10.5%), Tetum Terik (6.05%), Baikenu (5.87%), Kemak (5.85%), Bunak (5.48%), Tokodede (3.97%), and Fataluku (3.52%). Other indigenous languages accounted for 10.47%, while 1.09% of the population spoke foreign languages natively. Under Indonesian rule, the use of Portuguese was banned and only Indonesian was allowed to be used in government offices, schools and public business. Alt URL During the Indonesian occupation, Tetum and Portuguese were important unifying elements for the East Timorese people in opposing Javanese culture. Portuguese was adopted as one of the two official languages upon independence in 2002 for this reason and as a link to Lusophone nations in other parts of the world. It is now being taught and promoted with the help of Brazil, Portugal, and the Community of Portuguese Language Countries. According to the observatory of the Portuguese language, the East Timorese literacy rate was 77.8% in Tetum, 55.6% in Indonesian, and 39.3% in Portuguese, and that the primary literacy rate increased from 73% in 2009 to 83% in 2012. Indonesian and English are defined as working languages under the Constitution in the Final and Transitional Provisions, without setting a final date. In 2012, 35% could speak, read, and write Portuguese, which is up significantly from less than 5% in the 2006 UN Development Report. Portuguese is recovering as it is now been made the main official language of Timor, and is being taught in most schools. It is estimated that English is understood by 31.4% of the population. East Timor is a member of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries (also known as the Lusophone Commonwealth) and of the Latin Union. Aside from Tetum, Ethnologue lists the following indigenous languages: Adabe, Baikeno, Bunak, Fataluku, Galoli, Habun, Idat√©, Kairui-Midiki, Kemak, Lakalei, Makasae, Makuv'a, Mambae, Nauete, Tukudede, and Waima'a. According to the Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger, there are six endangered languages in East Timor: Adabe, Habu, Kairui-Midiki, Maku'a, Naueti, and Waima'a. Education Escola Portuguesa Ruy Cinatti, the Portuguese School of D√≠li. East Timor's adult literacy rate in 2010 was 58.3%, up from 37.6% in 2001. At the end of Portuguese rule, illiteracy was at 95%. The country's main university is the National University of East Timor. There are also four colleges. Since independence, both Indonesian and Tetum have lost ground as media of instruction, while Portuguese has increased: in 2001 only 8.4% of primary school and 6.8% of secondary school students attended a Portuguese-medium school; by 2005 this had increased to 81.6% for primary and 46.3% for secondary schools. Indonesian formerly played a considerable role in education, being used by 73.7% of all secondary school students as a medium of instruction, but by 2005 Portuguese was used by most schools in Baucau, Manatuto, as well as the capital district. The Philippines has sent Filipino teachers to East Timor to teach English, so as to facilitate a program between the two countries, under which deserving East Timorese nationals with English language skills will be granted university scholarships in the Philippines. Health See Health in East Timor Religion Santo Ant√≥nio de Motael, Dili According to the 2015 census, 97.57% of the population is Roman Catholic; 1.96% Protestant; 0.24% Muslim; 0.08% Traditional; 0.05% Buddhist; 0.02% Hindu, and 0.08% other religions. A 2016 survey conducted by the Demographic and Health Survey programme showed that Catholics made up 98.3% of the population, Protestants 1.2%, and Muslims 0.3%. The number of churches has grown from 100 in 1974 to over 800 in 1994,Robinson, G. If you leave us here, we will die, Princeton University Press 2010, p. 72. with Church membership having grown considerably under Indonesian rule as Pancasila, Indonesia's state ideology, requires all citizens to believe in one God and does not recognise traditional beliefs. East Timorese animist belief systems did not fit with Indonesia's constitutional monotheism, resulting in mass conversions to Christianity. Portuguese clergy were replaced with Indonesian priests and Latin and Portuguese mass was replaced by Indonesian mass. While just 20% of East Timorese called themselves Catholics at the time of the 1975 invasion, the figure surged to reach 95% by the end of the first decade after the invasion. In rural areas, Roman Catholicism is syncretised with local animist beliefs. With over 95% Catholic population, East Timor is currently the second most densely Catholic country in the world, after the Vatican.East Timor slowly rises from the ashes ETAN 21 September 2001 Online at etan.org. Retrieved 22 February 2008 Igreja da Imaculada Concei√ß√£o church, in Viqueque The number of Protestants and Muslims declined significantly after September 1999 because these groups were disproportionately represented among supporters of integration with Indonesia and among the Indonesian civil servants assigned to work in the province from other parts of Indonesia, many of whom left the country in 1999.International Religious Freedom Report 2007: Timor-Leste. United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor (14 September 2007). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. There are also small Protestant and Muslim communities. The Indonesian military forces formerly stationed in the country included a significant number of Protestants, who played a major role in establishing Protestant churches in the territory. Fewer than half of those congregations existed after September 1999, and many Protestants were among those who remained in West Timor. The Assemblies of God is the largest and most active of the Protestant denominations. While the Constitution of East Timor enshrines the principles of freedom of religion and separation of church and state in Section 45 Comma 1, it also acknowledges \\"the participation of the Catholic Church in the process of national liberation\\" in its preamble (although this has no legal value). Upon independence, the country joined the Philippines to become the only two predominantly Roman Catholic states in Asia, although nearby parts of eastern Indonesia such as West Timor and Flores also have Roman Catholic majorities. The Roman Catholic Church divides East Timor into three dioceses: the Diocese of D√≠li, the Diocese of Baucau, and the Diocese of Maliana. Culture Sacred house (lee teinu) in Lospalos The culture of East Timor reflects numerous influences, including Portuguese, Roman Catholic and Indonesian, on Timor's indigenous Austronesian and Melanesian cultures. East Timorese culture is heavily influenced by Austronesian legends. For example, East Timorese creation myth has it that an ageing crocodile transformed into the island of Timor as part of debt repayment to a young boy who had helped the crocodile when it was sick. As a result, the island is shaped like a crocodile and the boy's descendants are the native East Timorese who inhabit it. The phrase \\"leaving the crocodile\\" refers to the pained exile of East Timorese from their island. East Timor is currently finalising its dossiers needed for nominations in the UNESCO World Heritage List, UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists, UNESCO Creative Cities Network, UNESCO Global Geoparks Network, and UNESCO Biosphere Reserve Network. The country currently has one document in the UNESCO Memory of the World Register, namely, On the Birth of a Nation: Turning points. Arts Traditional Timorese dancers There is also a strong tradition of poetry in the country. Prime Minister Xanana Gusm√£o, for example, is a distinguished poet, earning the moniker \\"poet warrior\\". Architecturally, Portuguese-style buildings can be found, along with the traditional totem houses of the eastern region. These are known as uma lulik (\\"sacred houses\\") in Tetum and lee teinu (\\"legged houses\\") in Fataluku. Craftsmanship and the weaving of traditional scarves (tais) is also widespread. An extensive collection of Timorese audiovisual material is held at the National Film and Sound Archive of Australia. These holdings have been identified in a document titled The NFSA Timor-Leste Collection Profile, which features catalogue entries and essays for a total of 795 NFSA-held moving images, recorded sound and documentation works that have captured the history and culture of East Timor since the early 20th century.NFSA provides insight into Timor-Leste history on nfsa.gov.au The NFSA is working with the East Timorese government to ensure that all of this material can be used and accessed by the people of that country.A connection with Timor-Leste on nfsa.gov.au Cinema and TV drama In 2009 and 2010, East Timor was the setting for the Australian film Balibo and the South Korean film A Barefoot Dream. In 2013, the first East Timorese feature film, Beatriz's War, was released. Two further feature-length films, Abdul & Jos√© and Ema Nudar Umanu, were respectively released on 30 July 2017 through the television network of RTTL and on 16 August 2018 at the Melbourne International Film Festival. In 2010, the first East Timorese TV drama, Suku Hali was released. Cuisine The cuisine of East Timor consists of regional popular foods such as pork, fish, basil, tamarind, legumes, corn, rice, root vegetables, and tropical fruit. East Timorese cuisine has influences from Southeast Asian cuisine and from Portuguese dishes from its colonisation by Portugal. Flavours and ingredients from other former Portuguese colonies can be found due to the centuries-old Portuguese presence on the island. Due to the East and West combination of East Timor's cuisine, it developed features related to Filipino cuisine, which also experienced an East-West culinary combination. Sports National Stadium in Dili on 18 October 2009. The East Timor Secretary of Youth and Sports said the game was intended to promote peace and stability in the region. East Timor won 4-0. Sports organisations joined by East Timor include the International Olympic Committee (IOC), the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), the International Badminton Federation (IBF), the Union Cycliste Internationale, the International Weightlifting Federation, the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF), the International Basketball Federation (FIBA), and East Timor's national football team joined FIFA. East Timorese athletes competed in the 2003 Southeast Asian Games held 2003. In the 2003 ASEAN Paralympics Games, East Timor won a bronze medal. In the Athens 2004 Olympic Games, East Timorese athletes participated in athletics, weightlifting and boxing. East Timor won three medals in Arnis at the 2005 Southeast Asian Games. East Timor competed in the first Lusophony Games and, in October 2008, the country earned its first international points in a FIFA football match with a 2‚Äì2 draw against Cambodia. East Timor competed at the 2014 Winter Olympics. Thomas Americo was the first East Timorese fighter to fight for a world boxing title. He was murdered in 1999, shortly before the Indonesian occupation of East Timor ended.

It is one of the college boat clubs at the University of Oxford. Balliol College also competes at external regattas including Marlow Regatta and Henley Royal Regatta. History Balliol College's rowing outfit, including a blue bonnet with a chequered red, green and white band and jersey with thin red vertical stripes.Sherwood, p. 81. The Balliol College Archives have much material concerning the Boat Club from about 1840 onwards. The Buttery has an extensive collection of sports photographs and trophies including many to do with the Boat Club. Although it is questioned whether an official boat club existed until the 1850s.Sherwood, p. 16. The base of the Boat Club for the latter part of the 19th century and much of the 20th century was a grand barge, which was moored on the River Thames at the south side of Christ Church Meadow. The barge was bought from the Skinners' Company in 1859.Sherwood, p. 92. The present boathouse (semi- detached, with New College occupying the other half) was opened in May 1959. The barge was on view in 1996 at Henley, when it was up for auction. The first recorded headship by Balliol College was in 1851, bumping Wadham College on the first day,Sherwood, p. 118. and later they reclaimed headship in 1855 on the seventh night after bumping Brasenose College.Sherwood, p. 120. The College has been Head of the River in the Summer Eights many times, notably a longish run in the 1950s and also regaining the Headship in 2008. Balliol's previous last reign at the Head of the River was when they were head of Torpids for three consecutive years (1968‚Äì71). At Henley Royal Regatta, Balliol has won the following events:Sherwood, pp. 317‚Äì346. * Ladies' Challenge Plate ‚Äì 1855, 1858, 1890, 1891 * Visitors' Challenge Cup ‚Äì 1899, 1901 * Silver Goblets ‚Äì 1851, 1857, 1859 * Diamond Challenge Sculls ‚Äì 1902 At the 1975 British Rowing Championships, Balliol won the lightweight men's quad sculls. Alumni Famous Balliol oarsmen have included Lord Justice Chitty, Edmond Warre (Head Master of Eton), Frederick Septimus Kelly (composer, killed in France 1916: considered one of the greatest oarsmen of all time having won at least one event at Henley Royal Regatta each year from 1902‚Äì1906 and Olympic gold in 1908), Cardinal Heard, Dan Snow (three time 'Blue' and 2001 OUBC president), HM King Olav V of Norway and HM King Harald V of Norway (who was taught to row by fellow student Nick Bevan, later a rowing coach). Rivalries Not having traditionally been a \\"rowing college\\" over much of the 20th century, Balliol College has few rivalries with other Oxford colleges. However, the Balliol/Trinity rivalry is felt more recently, as Trinity has caught up with Balliol in Summer Eights, and Balliol has defeated Trinity to claim victory in Christ Church Regatta both in 2013.http://www.balliol.ox.ac.uk/news/2013/december/bcbc-triumphs-in-christ- church-regattahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNh14-lPc7I Recent form Balliol College 1st VIII rowing to the Summer Eights Headship in 2008.

As of 29 May 2010, the College's women are currently placed \\"Head of the River\\" in the Summer Eights. The club has a history of developing new talent, and the club's lower boats have also performed very well in recent years. The combined efforts of the more experienced oarsmen and a talented crop of novices helped BCBC to top the bumps charts for both Torpids and Summer Eights in 2008 and 2009. The BCBC Torpids campaign of 2008 was the most successful campaign by an Oxford University college on record, with the five crews entered by Balliol College Boat Club bumping on average 5.4 times over the four days of racing. Eights headships * Men: 1851, 1855, 1859, 1860, 1873, 1879, 1952, 1955, 1956, 2008 * Women: 2010, 2011 Torpids headships * Men: 1897‚Äì99, 1911, 1928, 1929, 1954, 1968‚Äì71 Organisation The boat club is governed by a committee consisting of student representatives and an overseeing Senior Member (currently Douglas Dupree). All are unelected, or elected by the previous committee, and volunteer their time to the club. Coaching The Men's 1st VIII is currently coached by George New. The Women's 1st VIII were coached by Nick Bevan, attended Balliol in 1960 and has had a long history in rowing coaching at school level. He was originally approached by Balliol to help coach the Men's 1st and 2nd VIIIs but found a home with the Women of Balliol. Equipment BCBC has greatly benefited from the generous donations of old Balliolites over the years. The current men's and women's first boats, the 'Beeland Rogers' and the 'Happy Rogers' respectively, reflect this trend. Beeland Rogers is a R86 Empacher while Happy Rogers is a more standard lightweight K series boat. Training locations Novice and development crews train on the stretch of the Thames, known as \\"The Isis\\" locally, which flows through Oxford, but senior crews train further afield at Abingdon.

The NT POSIX subsystem also did not provide any of the POSIX extensions that postdated the creation of Windows NT 3.1, such as those for POSIX Threads or POSIX IPC. The NT POSIX subsystem was included with the first versions of Windows NT because of 1980s US federal government requirements listed in Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 151-2.

Accepting only a monoculture in a social group can bear risks, just as a single species can wither in the face of environmental change, for lack of functional responses to the change.Jackson, Y. Encyclopedia of Multicultural Psychology, p. 203 Thus in military culture, valor is counted a typical behavior for an individual and duty, honor, and loyalty to the social group are counted as virtues or functional responses in the continuum of conflict. In the practice of religion, analogous attributes can be identified in a social group.  Description  The Fulani traditional marriage requirements which is flogging of the Groom Culture is considered a central concept in anthropology, encompassing the range of phenomena that are transmitted through social learning in human societies. Cultural universals are found in all human societies. These include expressive forms like art, music, dance, ritual, religion, and technologies like tool usage, cooking, shelter, and clothing. The concept of material culture covers the physical expressions of culture, such as technology, architecture and art, whereas the immaterial aspects of culture such as principles of social organization (including practices of political organization and social institutions), mythology, philosophy, literature (both written and oral), and science comprise the intangible cultural heritage of a society. In the humanities, one sense of culture as an attribute of the individual has been the degree to which they have cultivated a particular level of sophistication in the arts, sciences, education, or manners. The level of cultural sophistication has also sometimes been used to distinguish civilizations from less complex societies. Such hierarchical perspectives on culture are also found in class-based distinctions between a high culture of the social elite and a low culture, popular culture, or folk culture of the lower classes, distinguished by the stratified access to cultural capital. In common parlance, culture is often used to refer specifically to the symbolic markers used by ethnic groups to distinguish themselves visibly from each other such as body modification, clothing or jewelry. Mass culture refers to the mass-produced and mass mediated forms of consumer culture that emerged in the 20th century. Some schools of philosophy, such as Marxism and critical theory, have argued that culture is often used politically as a tool of the elites to manipulate the lower classes and create a false consciousness. Such perspectives are common in the discipline of cultural studies. In the wider social sciences, the theoretical perspective of cultural materialism holds that human symbolic culture arises from the material conditions of human life, as humans create the conditions for physical survival, and that the basis of culture is found in evolved biological dispositions. When used as a count noun, a \\"culture\\" is the set of customs, traditions, and values of a society or community, such as an ethnic group or nation. Culture is the set of knowledge acquired over time. In this sense, multiculturalism values the peaceful coexistence and mutual respect between different cultures inhabiting the same planet. Sometimes \\"culture\\" is also used to describe specific practices within a subgroup of a society, a subculture (e.g. \\"bro culture\\"), or a counterculture. Within cultural anthropology, the ideology and analytical stance of cultural relativism hold that cultures cannot easily be objectively ranked or evaluated because any evaluation is necessarily situated within the value system of a given culture.  Etymology  The modern term \\"culture\\" is based on a term used by the ancient Roman orator Cicero in his Tusculanae Disputationes, where he wrote of a cultivation of the soul or \\"cultura animi,\\" using an agricultural metaphor for the development of a philosophical soul, understood teleologically as the highest possible ideal for human development. Samuel Pufendorf took over this metaphor in a modern context, meaning something similar, but no longer assuming that philosophy was man's natural perfection. His use, and that of many writers after him, \\"refers to all the ways in which human beings overcome their original barbarism, and through artifice, become fully human.\\" In 1986, philosopher Edward S. Casey wrote, \\"The very word culture meant 'place tilled' in Middle English, and the same word goes back to Latin colere, 'to inhabit, care for, till, worship' and cultus, 'A cult, especially a religious one.' To be cultural, to have a culture, is to inhabit a place sufficiently intensely to cultivate it‚Äîto be responsible for it, to respond to it, to attend to it caringly.\\" Culture described by Richard Velkley: > ... originally meant the cultivation of the soul or mind, acquires most of > its later modern meaning in the writings of the 18th-century German > thinkers, who were on various levels developing Rousseau's criticism of > \\"modern liberalism and Enlightenment.\\" Thus a contrast between \\"culture\\" and > \\"civilization\\" is usually implied in these authors, even when not expressed > as such. In the words of anthropologist E.B. Tylor, it is \\"that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society.\\" Alternatively, in a contemporary variant, \\"Culture is defined as a social domain that emphasizes the practices, discourses and material expressions, which, over time, express the continuities and discontinuities of social meaning of a life held in common. The Cambridge English Dictionary states that culture is \\"the way of life, especially the general customs and beliefs, of a particular group of people at a particular time.\\" Terror management theory posits that culture is a series of activities and worldviews that provide humans with the basis for perceiving themselves as \\"person[s] of worth within the world of meaning\\"‚Äîraising themselves above the merely physical aspects of existence, in order to deny the animal insignificance and death that Homo sapiens became aware of when they acquired a larger brain. The word is used in a general sense as the evolved ability to categorize and represent experiences with symbols and to act imaginatively and creatively. This ability arose with the evolution of behavioral modernity in humans around 50,000 years ago and is often thought to be unique to humans. However, some other species have demonstrated similar, though much less complicated, abilities for social learning. It is also used to denote the complex networks of practices and accumulated knowledge and ideas that are transmitted through social interaction and exist in specific human groups, or cultures, using the plural form. Change The Beatles exemplified changing cultural dynamics, not only in music, but fashion and lifestyle. Over a half century after their emergence, they continue to have a worldwide cultural impact. It has been estimated from archaeological data that the human capacity for cumulative culture emerged somewhere between 500,000‚Äì170,000 years ago. Raimon Panikkar identified 29 ways in which cultural change can be brought about, including growth, development, evolution, involution, renovation, reconception, reform, innovation, revivalism, revolution, mutation, progress, diffusion, osmosis, borrowing, eclecticism, syncretism, modernization, indigenization, and transformation. In this context, modernization could be viewed as adoption of Enlightenment era beliefs and practices, such as science, rationalism, industry, commerce, democracy, and the notion of progress. Rein Raud, building on the work of Umberto Eco, Pierre Bourdieu and Jeffrey C. Alexander, has proposed a model of cultural change based on claims and bids, which are judged by their cognitive adequacy and endorsed or not endorsed by the symbolic authority of the cultural community in question. Australian natives opposing the arrival of Captain James Cook in 1770 Assyrian child wearing traditional clothing. Cultural invention has come to mean any innovation that is new and found to be useful to a group of people and expressed in their behavior but which does not exist as a physical object. Humanity is in a global \\"accelerating culture change period,\\" driven by the expansion of international commerce, the mass media, and above all, the human population explosion, among other factors. Culture repositioning means the reconstruction of the cultural concept of a society. Turkman woman, standing on a carpet at the entrance to a yurt, dressed in traditional clothing and jewelry Cultures are internally affected by both forces encouraging change and forces resisting change. These forces are related to both social structures and natural events, and are involved in the perpetuation of cultural ideas and practices within current structures, which themselves are subject to change. (See structuration.) Social conflict and the development of technologies can produce changes within a society by altering social dynamics and promoting new cultural models, and spurring or enabling generative action. These social shifts may accompany ideological shifts and other types of cultural change. For example, the U.S. feminist movement involved new practices that produced a shift in gender relations, altering both gender and economic structures. Environmental conditions may also enter as factors. For example, after tropical forests returned at the end of the last ice age, plants suitable for domestication were available, leading to the invention of agriculture, which in turn brought about many cultural innovations and shifts in social dynamics. Cultures are externally affected via contact between societies, which may also produce‚Äîor inhibit‚Äîsocial shifts and changes in cultural practices. War or competition over resources may impact technological development or social dynamics. Additionally, cultural ideas may transfer from one society to another, through diffusion or acculturation. In diffusion, the form of something (though not necessarily its meaning) moves from one culture to another. For example, Western restaurant chains and culinary brands sparked curiosity and fascination to the Chinese as China opened its economy to international trade in the late 20th-century. \\"Stimulus diffusion\\" (the sharing of ideas) refers to an element of one culture leading to an invention or propagation in another. \\"Direct borrowing,\\" on the other hand, tends to refer to technological or tangible diffusion from one culture to another. Diffusion of innovations theory presents a research-based model of why and when individuals and cultures adopt new ideas, practices, and products. Acculturation has different meanings. Still, in this context, it refers to the replacement of traits of one culture with another, such as what happened to certain Native American tribes and many indigenous peoples across the globe during the process of colonization. Related processes on an individual level include assimilation (adoption of a different culture by an individual) and transculturation. The transnational flow of culture has played a major role in merging different cultures and sharing thoughts, ideas, and beliefs. Early modern discourses German Romanticism Johann Herder called attention to national cultures. Immanuel Kant (1724‚Äì1804) formulated an individualist definition of \\"enlightenment\\" similar to the concept of bildung: \\"Enlightenment is man's emergence from his self-incurred immaturity.\\"Kant, Immanuel. 1784. \\"Answering the Question: What is Enlightenment?\\" (German: \\"Beantwortung der Frage: Was ist Aufkl√§rung?\\") Berlinische Monatsschrift, December (Berlin Monthly) He argued that this immaturity comes not from a lack of understanding, but from a lack of courage to think independently. Against this intellectual cowardice, Kant urged: Sapere Aude, \\"Dare to be wise!\\" In reaction to Kant, German scholars such as Johann Gottfried Herder (1744‚Äì1803) argued that human creativity, which necessarily takes unpredictable and highly diverse forms, is as important as human rationality. Moreover, Herder proposed a collective form of Bildung: \\"For Herder, Bildung was the totality of experiences that provide a coherent identity, and sense of common destiny, to a people.\\" Adolf Bastian developed a universal model of culture. In 1795, the Prussian linguist and philosopher Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767‚Äì1835) called for an anthropology that would synthesize Kant's and Herder's interests. During the Romantic era, scholars in Germany, especially those concerned with nationalist movements‚Äîsuch as the nationalist struggle to create a \\"Germany\\" out of diverse principalities, and the nationalist struggles by ethnic minorities against the Austro-Hungarian Empire‚Äîdeveloped a more inclusive notion of culture as \\"worldview\\" (Weltanschauung). According to this school of thought, each ethnic group has a distinct worldview that is incommensurable with the worldviews of other groups. Although more inclusive than earlier views, this approach to culture still allowed for distinctions between \\"civilized\\" and \\"primitive\\" or \\"tribal\\" cultures. In 1860, Adolf Bastian (1826‚Äì1905) argued for \\"the psychic unity of mankind.\\" He proposed that a scientific comparison of all human societies would reveal that distinct worldviews consisted of the same basic elements. According to Bastian, all human societies share a set of \\"elementary ideas\\" (Elementargedanken); different cultures, or different \\"folk ideas\\" (V√∂lkergedanken), are local modifications of the elementary ideas. This view paved the way for the modern understanding of culture. Franz Boas (1858‚Äì1942) was trained in this tradition, and he brought it with him when he left Germany for the United States. English Romanticism British poet and critic Matthew Arnold viewed \\"culture\\" as the cultivation of the humanist ideal. In the 19th century, humanists such as English poet and essayist Matthew Arnold (1822‚Äì1888) used the word \\"culture\\" to refer to an ideal of individual human refinement, of \\"the best that has been thought and said in the world.\\" This concept of culture is also comparable to the German concept of bildung: \\"...culture being a pursuit of our total perfection by means of getting to know, on all the matters which most concern us, the best which has been thought and said in the world.\\" In practice, culture referred to an elite ideal and was associated with such activities as art, classical music, and haute cuisine.Williams (1983), p. 90. Cited in argues that contemporary definitions of culture fall into three possibilities or mixture of the following three: * \\"a general process of intellectual, spiritual, and aesthetic development.\\" * \\"a particular way of life, whether of a people, period or a group.\\" * \\"the works and practices of intellectual and especially artistic activity.\\" As these forms were associated with urban life, \\"culture\\" was identified with \\"civilization\\" (from lat. civitas, city). Another facet of the Romantic movement was an interest in folklore, which led to identifying a \\"culture\\" among non-elites. This distinction is often characterized as that between high culture, namely that of the ruling social group, and low culture. In other words, the idea of \\"culture\\" that developed in Europe during the 18th and early 19th centuries reflected inequalities within European societies.Bakhtin 1981, p. 4 Edward Tylor was one of the first English- speaking scholars to use the term culture in an inclusive and universal sense. Matthew Arnold contrasted \\"culture\\" with anarchy; other Europeans, following philosophers Thomas Hobbes and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, contrasted \\"culture\\" with \\"the state of nature.\\" According to Hobbes and Rousseau, the Native Americans who were being conquered by Europeans from the 16th centuries on were living in a state of nature; this opposition was expressed through the contrast between \\"civilized\\" and \\"uncivilized.\\" According to this way of thinking, one could classify some countries and nations as more civilized than others and some people as more cultured than others. This contrast led to Herbert Spencer's theory of Social Darwinism and Lewis Henry Morgan's theory of cultural evolution. Just as some critics have argued that the distinction between high and low cultures is an expression of the conflict between European elites and non-elites, other critics have argued that the distinction between civilized and uncivilized people is an expression of the conflict between European colonial powers and their colonial subjects. Other 19th- century critics, following Rousseau, have accepted this differentiation between higher and lower culture, but have seen the refinement and sophistication of high culture as corrupting and unnatural developments that obscure and distort people's essential nature. These critics considered folk music (as produced by \\"the folk,\\" i.e., rural, illiterate, peasants) to honestly express a natural way of life, while classical music seemed superficial and decadent. Equally, this view often portrayed indigenous peoples as \\"noble savages\\" living authentic and unblemished lives, uncomplicated and uncorrupted by the highly stratified capitalist systems of the West. In 1870 the anthropologist Edward Tylor (1832‚Äì1917) applied these ideas of higher versus lower culture to propose a theory of the evolution of religion. According to this theory, religion evolves from more polytheistic to more monotheistic forms.McClenon, pp. 528‚Äì29 In the process, he redefined culture as a diverse set of activities characteristic of all human societies. This view paved the way for the modern understanding of religion. Anthropology Gobustan, Azerbaijan, dating back to 10,000 BCE and indicating a thriving culture Although anthropologists worldwide refer to Tylor's definition of culture, in the 20th century \\"culture\\" emerged as the central and unifying concept of American anthropology, where it most commonly refers to the universal human capacity to classify and encode human experiences symbolically, and to communicate symbolically encoded experiences socially. American anthropology is organized into four fields, each of which plays an important role in research on culture: biological anthropology, linguistic anthropology, cultural anthropology, and in the United States, archaeology. The term Kulturbrille, or \\"culture glasses,\\" coined by German American anthropologist Franz Boas, refers to the \\"lenses\\" through which we see our own countries. Martin Lindstrom asserts that Kulturbrille, which allow us to make sense of the culture we inhabit, also \\"can blind us to things outsiders pick up immediately.\\" Sociology An example of folkloric dancing in Colombia. The sociology of culture concerns culture as manifested in society. For sociologist Georg Simmel (1858‚Äì1918), culture referred to \\"the cultivation of individuals through the agency of external forms which have been objectified in the course of history.\\" As such, culture in the sociological field can be defined as the ways of thinking, the ways of acting, and the material objects that together shape a people's way of life. Culture can be any of two types, non-material culture or material culture. Non- material culture refers to the non-physical ideas that individuals have about their culture, including values, belief systems, rules, norms, morals, language, organizations, and institutions, while material culture is the physical evidence of a culture in the objects and architecture they make or have made. The term tends to be relevant only in archeological and anthropological studies, but it specifically means all material evidence which can be attributed to culture, past or present. Cultural sociology first emerged in Weimar Germany (1918‚Äì1933), where sociologists such as Alfred Weber used the term Kultursoziologie (cultural sociology). Cultural sociology was then \\"reinvented\\" in the English-speaking world as a product of the \\"cultural turn\\" of the 1960s, which ushered in structuralist and postmodern approaches to social science. This type of cultural sociology may be loosely regarded as an approach incorporating cultural analysis and critical theory. Cultural sociologists tend to reject scientific methods, instead hermeneutically focusing on words, artifacts and symbols. Physicist Alan Sokal published a paper in a journal of cultural sociology stating that gravity was a social construct that should be examined hermeneutically. See Sokal affair for further details. \\"Culture\\" has since become an important concept across many branches of sociology, including resolutely scientific fields like social stratification and social network analysis. As a result, there has been a recent influx of quantitative sociologists to the field. Thus, there is now a growing group of sociologists of culture who are, confusingly, not cultural sociologists. These scholars reject the abstracted postmodern aspects of cultural sociology, and instead, look for a theoretical backing in the more scientific vein of social psychology and cognitive science. nowruz is a good sample of Popular and Folklore culture that is celebrating by people in more than 22 countries with different nations and religions, at the 1st day of spring. It has been celebrated by diverse communities for over 7,000 years Early researchers and development of cultural sociology The sociology of culture grew from the intersection between sociology (as shaped by early theorists like Marx, Durkheim, and Weber) with the growing discipline of anthropology, wherein researchers pioneered ethnographic strategies for describing and analyzing a variety of cultures around the world. Part of the legacy of the early development of the field lingers in the methods (much of cultural, sociological research is qualitative), in the theories (a variety of critical approaches to sociology are central to current research communities), and in the substantive focus of the field. For instance, relationships between popular culture, political control, and social class were early and lasting concerns in the field. Cultural studies In the United Kingdom, sociologists and other scholars influenced by Marxism such as Stuart Hall (1932‚Äì2014) and Raymond Williams (1921‚Äì1988) developed cultural studies. Following nineteenth-century Romantics, they identified \\"culture\\" with consumption goods and leisure activities (such as art, music, film, food, sports, and clothing). They saw patterns of consumption and leisure as determined by relations of production, which led them to focus on class relations and the organization of production. In the United States, cultural studies focuses largely on the study of popular culture; that is, on the social meanings of mass-produced consumer and leisure goods. Richard Hoggart coined the term in 1964 when he founded the Birmingham Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies or CCCS. It has since become strongly associated with Stuart Hall, who succeeded Hoggart as Director. Cultural studies in this sense, then, can be viewed as a limited concentration scoped on the intricacies of consumerism, which belongs to a wider culture sometimes referred to as \\"Western civilization\\" or \\"globalism.\\" From the 1970s onward, Stuart Hall's pioneering work, along with that of his colleagues Paul Willis, Dick Hebdige, Tony Jefferson, and Angela McRobbie, created an international intellectual movement. As the field developed, it began to combine political economy, communication, sociology, social theory, literary theory, media theory, film/video studies, cultural anthropology, philosophy, museum studies, and art history to study cultural phenomena or cultural texts. In this field researchers often concentrate on how particular phenomena relate to matters of ideology, nationality, ethnicity, social class, and/or gender. Cultural studies is concerned with the meaning and practices of everyday life. These practices comprise the ways people do particular things (such as watching television or eating out) in a given culture. It also studies the meanings and uses people attribute to various objects and practices. Specifically, culture involves those meanings and practices held independently of reason. Watching television to view a public perspective on a historical event should not be thought of as culture unless referring to the medium of television itself, which may have been selected culturally; however, schoolchildren watching television after school with their friends to \\"fit in\\" certainly qualifies since there is no grounded reason for one's participation in this practice. In the context of cultural studies, the idea of a text includes not only written language, but also films, photographs, fashion or hairstyles: the texts of cultural studies comprise all the meaningful artifacts of culture. Similarly, the discipline widens the concept of \\"culture.\\" \\"Culture\\" for a cultural- studies researcher not only includes traditional high culture (the culture of ruling social groups) and popular culture, but also everyday meanings and practices. The last two, in fact, have become the main focus of cultural studies. A further and recent approach is comparative cultural studies, based on the disciplines of comparative literature and cultural studies. Scholars in the United Kingdom and the United States developed somewhat different versions of cultural studies after the late 1970s. The British version of cultural studies had originated in the 1950s and 1960s, mainly under the influence of Richard Hoggart, E.P. Thompson, and Raymond Williams, and later that of Stuart Hall and others at the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies at the University of Birmingham. This included overtly political, left-wing views, and criticisms of popular culture as \\"capitalist\\" mass culture; it absorbed some of the ideas of the Frankfurt School critique of the \\"culture industry\\" (i.e. mass culture). This emerges in the writings of early British cultural- studies scholars and their influences: see the work of (for example) Raymond Williams, Stuart Hall, Paul Willis, and Paul Gilroy. In the United States, Lindlof and Taylor write, \\"Cultural studies [were] grounded in a pragmatic, liberal-pluralist tradition.\\" The American version of cultural studies initially concerned itself more with understanding the subjective and appropriative side of audience reactions to, and uses of, mass culture; for example, American cultural-studies advocates wrote about the liberatory aspects of fandom. The distinction between American and British strands, however, has faded. Some researchers, especially in early British cultural studies, apply a Marxist model to the field. This strain of thinking has some influence from the Frankfurt School, but especially from the structuralist Marxism of Louis Althusser and others. The main focus of an orthodox Marxist approach concentrates on the production of meaning. This model assumes a mass production of culture and identifies power as residing with those producing cultural artifacts. In a Marxist view, the mode and relations of production form the economic base of society, which constantly interacts and influences superstructures, such as culture. Other approaches to cultural studies, such as feminist cultural studies and later American developments of the field, distance themselves from this view. They criticize the Marxist assumption of a single, dominant meaning, shared by all, for any cultural product. The non- Marxist approaches suggest that different ways of consuming cultural artifacts affect the meaning of the product. This view comes through in the book Doing Cultural Studies: The Story of the Sony Walkman (by Paul du Gay et al.), which seeks to challenge the notion that those who produce commodities control the meanings that people attribute to them. Feminist cultural analyst, theorist, and art historian Griselda Pollock contributed to cultural studies from viewpoints of art history and psychoanalysis. The writer Julia Kristeva is among influential voices at the turn of the century, contributing to cultural studies from the field of art and psychoanalytical French feminism. Petrakis and Kostis (2013) divide cultural background variables into two main groups: # The first group covers the variables that represent the \\"efficiency orientation\\" of the societies: performance orientation, future orientation, assertiveness, power distance, and uncertainty avoidance. # The second covers the variables that represent the \\"social orientation\\" of societies, i.e., the attitudes and lifestyles of their members. These variables include gender egalitarianism, institutional collectivism, in-group collectivism, and human orientation. In 2016, a new approach to culture was suggested by Rein Raud, who defines culture as the sum of resources available to human beings for making sense of their world and proposes a two-tiered approach, combining the study of texts (all reified meanings in circulation) and cultural practices (all repeatable actions that involve the production, dissemination or transmission of purposes), thus making it possible to re-link anthropological and sociological study of culture with the tradition of textual theory.  Psychology  Cognitive tools suggest a way for people from certain culture to deal with real-life problems, like Suanpan for Chinese to perform mathematical calculation Starting in the 1990s, psychological research on culture influence began to grow and challenge the universality assumed in general psychology. Culture psychologists began to try to explore the relationship between emotions and culture, and answer whether the human mind is independent from culture. For example, people from collectivistic cultures, such as the Japanese, suppress their positive emotions more than their American counterparts. Culture may affect the way that people experience and express emotions. On the other hand, some researchers try to look for differences between people's personalities across cultures. As different cultures dictate distinctive norms, culture shock is also studied to understand how people react when they are confronted with other cultures. Cognitive tools may not be accessible or they may function differently cross culture. For example, people that are raised in a culture with an abacus are trained with distinctive reasoning style. Cultural lenses may also make people view the same outcome of events differently. Westerners are more motivated by their successes than their failures, while East Asians are better motivated by the avoidance of failure. Culture is important for psychologists to consider when understanding the human mental operation.

It was based on the stage play of the same title by Alan Melville.  Plot  The penniless 19th Earl of Locharne (David Tomlinson), the owner of a run-down Scottish castle which he has made into a mostly empty hotel, has to deal with a myriad of financial troubles, starting with his creditors and the few disgruntled tenants. Then there is Mr. Phillips (Brian Oulton), a socialist official from the British National Coal Board, which wants to requisition (not buy) it to convert into a vacation hostel for miners and their families. The earl introduces Phillips to a beautiful family ghost, Ermyntrude (Patricia Dainton), the earl's grandfather's mistress. Next, a long-time prospective purchaser, wealthy, attractive American divorcee Mrs. Clodfelter Dunne (Barbara Kelly), shows up unannounced to look over the place in person. The earl's evident attraction to Mrs. Dunne is observed with dismay by his assistant, \\"Boss\\" Trent (Helen Cherry). Both Mr. Phillips and Mrs. Dunne stay overnight at the castle. The earl is hard-pressed to simultaneously convince the former that the castle is falling into ruin and the latter that it is well worth purchasing. Meanwhile, eccentric boarder Miss Nicholson (Margaret Rutherford) is obsessed with proving that the earl is actually the rightful King of Scotland. When Mrs. Dunne expresses her belief that she is a member of the family, a delighted Miss Nicholson sets out to try to trace her lineage. Mrs. Dunne eventually decides to purchase the place. She and the earl drive to Aberdeen to see his solicitor, Pettigrew. The price is $250,000 (about ¬£70,000). Later, the earl receives a message to see an unnamed lady in hotel room 57. However, when he enters the room, he is disappointed to find Miss Nicholson and her followers, bent on a Jacobite restoration. The ensuing party runs late into the night, with Mrs. Dunne and Pettigrew in attendance. The earl and Mrs. Dunne, both rather intoxicated, return to the castle around four in the morning. The next day, Trent, believing that the earl and Mrs. Dunne were alone in the hotel room, quarrels with the earl. She makes him inform Mrs. Dunne that the castle is in danger of being requisitioned. Mrs. Dunne takes back her cheque. However, after hearing from Phillips that he has been passed over for promotion, the earl has Mrs. Dunne offer him the position of managing the castle for her for a large salary, provided he turn in a recommendation that the castle not be acquired. He agrees. Now that the sale has been reinstated, the earl asks Trent to marry him, much to her delight. Miss Nicholson interrupts them with dreadful news: it turns out the earl is not in the direct line of succession after all.

Korni Group) was a Yugoslav rock band from Belgrade, also known as the Kornelyans, the name which they used during a short-lived foray into the international market. Formed in 1968, Korni Grupa was one of the first Yugoslav rock bands to achieve major mainstream popularity, and the first Yugoslav supergroup. Korni Grupa is considered to be one of the most prominent and influential bands in the history of rock music in Yugoslavia. Since the beginning of their career, the band had developed a two-way musical development, one of commercial pop rock music aimed for mainstream popularity, and the other, an artistically influenced progressive rock sound crossed with influences of psychedelic, folk, jazz and symphonic rock music. The band was led by keyboard player Kornelije Kovaƒç who with the bassist Bojan Hreljac and drummer Vladimir Furduj and guitarist Velibor Kacl formed the band. After changing several vocalists, Miroslava Kojadinoviƒá, Du≈°an Preleviƒá and Dalibor Brun, and releasing several singles, the band's vocalist became Dado Topiƒá who brought along his former bandmate Josip Boƒçek as the replacement for Kacl. The lineup recorded an album's worth material, released posthumously as 1941., before Topiƒá's departure. His substitute was Zdravko ƒåoliƒá who after a six- month period left the spot to Zlatko Pejakoviƒá. With Pejakoviƒá the band recorded their eponymous debut album, the first full length rock album in SR Serbia and fourth in Yugoslavia and an English language second album Not an Ordinary Life, under the name Kornelyans. The band had also performed at the 1974 Eurovision Song Contest reaching the 12th place, owing to which, along with the little success of the second album, the band had decided to split. They held two farewell concerts at the Novi Sad Studio M and disbanded on December 1, 1974. A part of the recordings from the concerts was released on the posthumous compilation album Mrtvo more, the first double album in the history of Yugoslav rock music. After the band disbandment, the band members pursued careers as studio musicians, producers and solo acts and reunited in 1987 with Topiƒá on vocals for two performances, in Zagreb and Belgrade.  History   Early years (1968‚Äì1969)  Having left the Sarajevo band Indexi in 1968, keyboardist Kornelije \\"Bata\\" Kovaƒç returned to Belgrade and after meeting bassist Bojan Hreljac, former member of recently disbanded Elipse, the two decided to form a new band, inviting drummer Vladimir \\"Furda\\" Furduj, Hreljac's former bandmate from Elipse, and guitarist Velibor \\"Borko\\" Kacl from the also recently disbanded Zlatni Deƒçaci.≈Ωikiƒá, 1999, p.121 Korni Grupa completed its lineup with the arrival of the female singer Miroslava \\"Seka\\" Kojadinoviƒá in September 1968, with the event receiving a significant media coverage due to the members being well known public figures owing to their previous work, and thus the band had become the first Yugoslav supergroup.≈Ωikiƒá, 1999, p.121 The band had its first live appearance at the Belgrade Dom Sindikata during the Sportsman of the Year award ceremony.Janjatoviƒá, 2006, p.115 The performance featured two go-go dancers appearing on stage with the band which performed several songs they have written during the rehearsals at Hreljac's garage and a cover version of the song \\"If You Go Away\\" in which the band had used the sounds of the sea played on a tape recorder placed inside the piano.≈Ωikiƒá, 1999, p.121 The performance provided the band with the public's attention and opportunities to perform live at numerous places in Belgrade.≈Ωikiƒá, 1999, p.121 One of such performances was at Belgrade's Dom Omladine, where they held a conceptual multimedia performance with painter Ra≈°a Trkulja painting during the performance, ballerinas closed in multicolored plastic cylinders which would blur their silhouettes during their dancing, and actors performing sketches such as dusting the piano or the Lady With the Dog sketch in which a lady would walk a man on a leash in the first part of the performance and the man walking the lady in the second part.≈Ωikiƒá, 1999, p.121-122 The band was also invited to perform in the Radio Belgrade show Studio VI vam pru≈æa ≈°ansu (Studio VI Gives You a Chance), however, Kojadinoviƒá refused to sing, so for the band's appearance in the show Kovaƒç provided the lead vocals.Janjatoviƒá, 2006, p.115 The reason for her refusal was the selection of the songs for the performance, including the pop song \\"Marijan\\", the first song the Kovaƒç had written with the band, which she disliked due to being heavily influenced by the 1960s underground music, especially Julie Driscoll, whose version of \\"Season of the Witch\\" the band performed at the time.≈Ωikiƒá, 1999, p.121 Since the rest of the band took Kovaƒç's side, Kojadinoviƒá was excluded from the band, after which she started a short solo career, releasing several singers before becoming a lawyer.Janjatoviƒá, 2006, p.115 Du≈°an \\"Prele\\" Preleviƒá, famous around Belgrade at the time for his distinguished rhythm and blues and soul vocal style and excessive lifestyle, became the new Korni Grupa vocalist.≈Ωikiƒá, 1999, p.123-124 At the time, Kovaƒç was influenced by the emerging progressive rock musical style, but due to the hostility of the audience and critics towards the music, he wrote the pop-oriented song \\"Cigu- ligu\\" (\\"Tweedle-dum, Tweedle-dee\\") which Korni Grupa performed at the 1968 Jugovizija festival in Zagreb, the competition for the Yugoslav representative for the Eurovision song contest.Janjatoviƒá, 2006, p.115 Preleviƒá arrived drunk to the performance leading to an argument with Kovaƒç that ended in the decision that he should leave the band.Janjatoviƒá, 2006, p.115 Nevertheless, in 1969, the band released their debut single \\"Cigu-ligu\\", with \\"ƒåovek i pas\\" (\\"A Man and a Dog\\") as the B-side, with Preleviƒá on vocals, the latter of which Preleviƒá rerecorded on his solo album Ja, Prele (I, Prele), released in 1996. Having left Korni Grupa, Preleviƒá appeared in the cult 1969 Yugoslav adaptation of the Hair musical, recorded a studio album with Opus, a single with Oliver Mandiƒá, as well as several solo albums and devoted to a literary and journalism career.≈Ωikiƒá, 1999, p.124-125 At the age of 58, Preleviƒá died in Belgrade after a long illness, on July 28, 2007. The new Korni Grupa singer became Dalibor Brun from Rijeka, a former Uragani and Bohemi member, with whom Korni Grupa recorded their first hits \\"Magiƒçna ruka\\" (\\"The Magic Hand\\"), \\"Sonata\\" and \\"Dzum-ram\\".Janjatoviƒá, 2006, p.115 With Brun, himself fostering a typically festival singer image and a rock vocal style, the band succeeded in maintaining a double track career ‚Äì alternating between being a festival band performing commercial pop rock songs on one hand and a progressive rock band following the current global rock musical trends on the other.≈Ωikiƒá, 1999, p.125 With the folk influenced song \\"Pastir i cvet\\" (\\"A Shepperd and a Flower\\"), the band appeared at the Singing Europe festival in Netherlands winning the award for the most original band,

(\\"If You Were Alone\\") as the B-side,Janjatoviƒá, 2006, p.117 featured Balkan folk instruments ≈°argija, tarabuk and frula.Janjatoviƒá, 2006, p.115 This was however, the last recording with Brun as he, becoming less enthusiastic about the band's work, decided to leave the band conventionally.Janjatoviƒá, 2006, p.115 Having left Korni Grupa, Brun started a successful career as a pop singer.Janjatoviƒá, 2006, p.230  Dado Topiƒá years (1969‚Äì1971)  After Brun's departure, owing to the mutual friendship with Lokica Stefanoviƒá, the new Korni Grupa vocalist became Dado Topiƒá, a former member of the Osijek band Dinamiti, with whom the band appeared at the Opatija festival, performing the song \\"Devojƒçice mala\\" (\\"Little Girl\\"), which was released on a split single with the song \\"Priƒça se\\" (\\"The Rumor Says\\") by the quartet 4M.Janjatoviƒá, 2006, p.115 With Topiƒá, the band held their first solo concert in Belgrade on November 6, 1969 in Dom omladine and the concert was entitled \\"Uz malu pomoƒá na≈°ih frendova\\" (\\"With A Little Help from Our Friends\\").Janjatoviƒá, 2006, p.115 Soon after, Kacl left the band and retired from music, dying in a car accident in May 1984.Janjatoviƒá, 2006, p.115 He was replaced by Josip Boƒçek, Topiƒá's former bandmate from Dinamiti who at the time was playing in his own band Boƒçek i Tri.Janjatoviƒá, 2006, p.115

becoming a successful solo act.Janjatoviƒá, 2006, p.227 Topiƒá was replaced by the former Ambasadori vocalist Zdravko ƒåoliƒá in September 1971.Janjatoviƒá, 2006, p.116 A young singer with more of a festival schlager sensibility, twenty-year-old ƒåoliƒá right away presented an uneasy fit with the band's well-established propensity for musical experimentation with even his stage movements and

Albert de Gondi (4 November 1522 in Florence - 1602) seigneur du Perron, comte, then marquis de Belle-Isle (1573), duc de Retz (from 1581), was a marshal of France and a member of the Gondi family. His father was Guidobaldo, seigneur de Perron, who became a banker at Lyon, and his mother was Marie-Catherine de Pierrevive - his siblings included cardinal Pierre de Gondi. His motto was Non sine labore. Life Albert de Gondi was the son of Marie Catherine Gondi. He joined the court of Henry II of France on his accession in 1547 and around 1550 joined a company of chevau-l√©gers. On 13 August 1554 he served at the battle of Renty and soon afterward Henry II soon made him a gentleman of the chamber and master of the wardrobe to Charles of France. He continued to occupy these posts under Charles X and Henry III. In 1555, he won a great reputation in Italy, at the sieges of Ulpiau and Coni and the taking of Verceil. He also served with great distinction in the expeditions into Piedmont and Corsica. On 10 August 1557 he participated in the Battle of Saint-Quentin and on 13 July 1558 at the battle of Gravelines. He was in 1559 made captain of a company of gendarmes and fought at their head at the battle of Saint-Denis on 10 November 1567, at Jarnac on 13 March 1569 and at Moncontour on the following 3 October. He was chosen to carry news of victory at Moncontour to the king and was the same month made captain of 50 men at arms. Knighted on the king's orders, he won a place as conseiller d‚Äô√âtat. He was then employed as French ambassador to the Imperial court at Vienna and on 22 October 1570 was the French king's proxy at his marriage to Elizabeth of Austria. On the death of marshal Vieilleville, the comte de Retz was made governor and lieutenant-general in the pays messin, and governor of the town of Metz, by provisions granted at Duretal on 30 November 1571. He was then made captain of the first company of gentlemen of the king's household after the death of the duc de Roannois in December the same year. In 1572 he was one of the advisors in council with Catherine de' Medici at the Tuileries on the evening of August 22, the night before the ordering of the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre; he and other Italian advisors were afterwards given much of the blame for the massacres by the Huguenots: \\"All the contemporary chronicles (save one which he is suspected of authoring) incriminate him in the St Bartholomew's massacres\\".pp 26-7 The Duke of Anjou and the Politique Struggle During the Wars of Religion, Mack P. Holt, Cambridge University Press, 2002, , At the end of 1572 he was charged with a mission to Elizabeth I of England, successfully persuading her not to give aid to French Protestants. At the beginning of 1573, coming back from London, the comte de Retz commanded a squadron and forced count Montgomery to abandon Belle-Isle. The French king raised this town to a marquisate and granted it to the count of Retz, who then set out for the 1573 Siege of La Rochelle, where he was wounded. A vacancy for a marshal of France came about due to the death of the mar√©chal de Tavanes, and this was granted to the comte de Retz by provisions given at the ch√¢teau de Boulogne on 6 July 1573Histoire g√©n√©alogique de la maison de Gondi, tom.

He then became governor of Provence, by provisions given in the same place and on the same day, 6 July 1573 : these were registered at the parliament of Provence, 22 August 1574. Mar√©chal de Retz then left his governorship at Metz. He accompanied Henri III, duc d‚ÄôAnjou to Poland, returned to France with him and represented the constable at this prince's consecration, on which occasion he was also admitted to this prince's privy council. He dismissed his company of 100 gentlemen in the month of January 1575 and was made commander in chief of the army in Provence, forcing the towns and castles rebelling against Henry to submit to him and placing the town of Menerbes back under obedience to the pope. Marriage and issue On 4 September 1565, he became the second husband of Claude Catherine de Clermont-Tonnerre, baroness of Retz and of Dampierre, daughter of Claude de Clermont-Tonnerre, baron de Dampierre, with whom he had 10 children: * Charles (1569-1596), marquis de Belle-Isle, g√©n√©ral des Gal√®res de France, whose descendants end with the women of the 18th century ; * Claude-Marguerite (1570-1650), who married Florimond, marquis de Piennes (+1592) ; * Fran√ßoise (+1627), who married Lancelot Grognet de Vass√© ; * Gabrielle who married Claude de Bossut, seigneur d'Escry ; * Hyppolite (+1646) who married L√©onor de Magdelaine marquis de Ragny ; * Henri de Gondi, cardinal de Retz (1572-1622), bishop of Paris. * Louise (1572-1661), nun ; * Madelaine (+1662), nun ; * Philippe-Emmanuel (1581-1626), comte de Joigny, marquis de Belle-Isle, baron de Montmirel, g√©n√©ral des Gal√®res de France, who married Fran√ßoise de Silly (+1625), dame de Commercy, daughter of Antoine, comte de La Rochepot, whose descendants end with the 18th century women. * Jean-Fran√ßois de Gondi, cardinal de Retz (1584-1654), first archbishop of Paris.

Latexes are found in nature, but synthetic latexes are common as well. Latex as found in nature is a milky fluid found in 10% of all flowering plants (angiosperms). It is a complex emulsion consisting of proteins, alkaloids, starches, sugars, oils, tannins, resins, and gums that coagulate on exposure to air. It is usually exuded after tissue injury. In most plants, latex is white, but some have yellow, orange, or scarlet latex. Since the 17th century, latex has been used as a term for the fluid substance in plants. It serves mainly as defense against herbivorous insects. Latex is not to be confused with plant sap; it is a separate substance, separately produced, and with separate functions. The word latex is also used to refer to natural latex rubber, particularly non- vulcanized rubber. Such is the case in products like latex gloves, latex condoms and latex clothing. Originally, the name given to latex by indigenous Equator tribes who cultivated the plant was \\"caoutchouc\\", from the words caa ('tear') and ochu ('tree'), because of the way it is collected. Biology Articulated laticifers The cells (laticifers) in which latex is found make up the laticiferous system, which can form in two very different ways. In many plants, the laticiferous system is formed from rows of cells laid down in the meristem of the stem or root. The cell walls between these cells are dissolved so that continuous tubes, called latex vessels, are formed. Since these vessels are made of many cells, they are known as articulated laticifers. This method of formation is found in the poppy family and in the rubber trees (Para rubber tree, members of the family Euphorbiaceae, members of the mulberry and fig family, such as the Panama rubber tree Castilla elastica), and members of the family Asteraceae. For instance, Parthenium argentatum the guayule plant, is in the tribe Heliantheae; other latex-bearing Asteraceae with articulated laticifers include members of the Cichorieae, a clade whose members produce latex, some of them in commercially interesting amounts. This includes Taraxacum kok-saghyz, a species cultivated for latex production. Non-articulated laticifers In the milkweed and spurge families, on the other hand, the laticiferous system is formed quite differently. Early in the development of the seedling, latex cells differentiate, and as the plant grows these latex cells grow into a branching system extending throughout the plant. In many euphorbs, the entire structure is made from a single cell ‚Äì this type of system is known as a non-articulated laticifer, to distinguish it from the multi-cellular structures discussed above. In the mature plant, the entire laticiferous system is descended from a single cell or group of cells present in the embryo. The laticiferous system is present in all parts of the mature plant, including roots, stems, leaves, and sometimes the fruits. It is particularly noticeable in the cortical tissues. Latex is usually exuded as a white liquid, but is some cases it can be clear, yellow or red, as in Cannabaceae. Productive species Latex is produced by 20,000 flowering plant species from over 40 families. These include both dicots and monocots. Latex has been found in 14 percent of tropical plant species, as well as six percent of temperate plant species. Several members of the fungal kingdom also produce latex upon injury, such as Lactarius deliciosus and other milk-caps. This suggests it is the product of convergent evolution and has been selected for on many separate occasions. Defense function Rubber latex Latex functions to protect the plant from herbivores. The idea was first proposed in 1887 by Joseph F. James, who noted that latex > carries with it at the same time such disagreeable properties that it > becomes a better protection to the plant from enemies than all the thorns, > prickles, or hairs that could be provided. In this plant, so copious and so > distasteful has the sap become that it serves a most important purpose in > its economy. Evidence showing this defense function include the finding that slugs will eat leaves drained of their latex but not intact ones, that many insects sever the veins carrying latex before they feed, and that the latex of Asclepias humistrata (sandhill milkweed) kills by trapping 30% of newly hatched monarch butterfly caterpillars. Other evidence is that latex contains 50‚Äì1000√ó higher concentrations of defense substances than other plant tissues. These toxins include ones that are also toxic to the plant and consist of a diverse range of chemicals that are either poisonous or \\"antinutritive\\". Latex is actively moved to the area of injury; in the case of Cryptostegia grandiflora, this can be more than 70 cm. The clotting property of latex is functional in this defense since it limits wastage and its stickiness traps insects and their mouthparts. While there exist other explanations for the existence of latex including storage and movement of plant nutrients, waste, and maintenance of water balance that \\"[e]ssentially none of these functions remain credible and none have any empirical support\\". Applications Opium poppy exuding fresh latex from a cut The latex of many species can be processed to produce many materials. Natural rubber is the most important product obtained from latex; more than 12,000 plant species yield latex containing rubber, though in the vast majority of those species the rubber is not suitable for commercial use. This latex is used to make many other products including mattresses, gloves, swim caps, condoms, catheters and balloons. Balat√° and gutta percha latex contain an inelastic polymer related to rubber. Latex from the chicle and jelutong trees was used in chewing gum. Dried latex from the opium poppy is called opium, the source of several useful analgesic alkaloids such as codeine, thebaine, and morphine, the latter two of which can then further be used in the synthesis and manufacture of other (typically stronger) opioids for medicinal use, and of heroin for the illegal drug trade. The opium poppy is also the source of medically useful non-analgesic alkaloids, such as papaverine and noscapine. Synthetic latexes are used in coatings (e.g. latex paint) and glues because they solidify by coalescence of the polymer particles as the water evaporates, and therefore can form films without releasing potentially toxic organic solvents in the environment. Other uses include cement additives, and to conceal information on scratchcards. Latex, usually styrene-based, is also used in immunoassays. Clothing Latex is used in many types of clothing. Worn on the body (or applied directly by painting), it tends to be skin-tight, producing a \\"second skin\\" effect. Allergic reactions Some people only experience a mild allergy when exposed to latex, like eczema, contact dermatitis or developing a rash. Others have a serious latex allergy, and exposure to latex products such as latex gloves can cause anaphylactic shock. Guayule latex has only 2% of the levels of protein found in Hevea latexes, and is being researched as a lower-allergen substitute. Additionally, chemical processes may be employed to reduce the amount of antigenic protein in Hevea latex, yielding alternative materials such as Vytex Natural Rubber Latex which provide significantly reduced exposure to latex allergens. About half of people with spina bifida are also allergic to natural latex rubber, as well as people who have had multiple surgeries, and people who have had prolonged exposure to natural latex. Environmental impact Microbial degradation Several species of the microbe genera Actinomycetes, Streptomyces, Nocardia, Micromonospora, and Actinoplanes are capable of consuming rubber latex. However, the rate of biodegradation is slow, and the growth of bacteria utilizing rubber as a sole carbon source is also slow.

Organization and history Earthwatch headquarters are in Boston (Massachusetts), as well as offices in Oxford (England), Melbourne (Australia), Tokyo (Japan) and Hong Kong (China). Earthwatch was founded as Educational Expeditions International in 1971 near Boston (USA) by Robert A. Citron and Clarence Truesdale, then superintendent of Vermont public schools. In 1972, Brian A.Rosborough joined Educational Expeditions International as a volunteer and six months later became full-time president of the newly named Earthwatch. Since 1971, the worldwide organization has recruited more than 110,000 volunteers who have joined scientists in the field as research assistants, and between them have contributed more than 11 million hours of their time to front-line environmental research all over the world. Earthwatch supports more than 50 vital research expeditions in nearly 40 counties. Earthwatch Australia is a partner in Bush Blitz, operated by Australian Biological Resources Study with co-funding by Bush Blitz founding partner BHP Billiton. Research areas Earthwatch volunteers partner with leading scientists in the field to conduct valuable research across four vital areas: * Climate Change - Climate change poses one of the greatest challenges to the planet. Earthwatch supports research that improves the understanding of how climate change is affecting different environments, and they find ways to help communities reduce their impacts and adapt to changes. * Archeology & Culture - This research shines a light on the combined genetic, ecological, cultural, and linguistic variation discovered in the native biological and cultural communities. These research programs unearth the past in a way that safeguards the future. * Wildlife & Ecosystems - Habitats and animals all over the world area threatened. The goal of this research is to create conservation plans and help protect our planet and its inhabitants in today's ever-evolving landscape. * Ocean Health - This research seeks to protect marine biodiversity with a focus on those parts of the ocean most quickly impacted by society, such as the highly threatened coastal habitats including mangroves and coral reefs. Earthwatch expeditions Current research expeditions being fielded by Earthwatch scientists and volunteers from around the world: * Amazon Riverboat Exploration - Advancing strategies for community-based wildlife management and conservation in rural areas of Loreto, Peru that facilitate sustainable hunting for local communities, and ensure that nationally protected areas and conservation concessions work with local people and not against them. * Animals of Malawi in the Majete Wildlife Reserve - How can we best help African wildlife return to and thrive in their native habitat? * Archaeology of the Mongolian Steppe - What archaeological treasures await researchers at the Ikh Nart Nature Reserve in Mongolia? * Blazing the Biodiversity Trail in Brazil - What can scientists learn about conservation and biodiversity by observing the movements of wildlife in Brazil? * Butterflies and Bees in the Indian Himalayas - What does climate change hold for the Himalayas?

Remineralisation is a natural process and does not have to involve fluoride. Tooth remineralisation is the natural repair process for non-cavitated tooth lesions,Fejerskov, O., Nyvad, Bente, & Kidd, Edwina A. M. (2015). Dental caries : The disease and its clinical management (Third ed.), in which calcium, phosphate and sometimes fluoride ions are deposited into crystal voids in demineralised enamel. Remineralisation can contribute towards restoring strength and function within tooth structure.Cochrane NJ, Cai F, Huq NL, Burrow MF, Reynolds EC. New approaches to enhanced remineralization of tooth enamel. Journal of Dental Research. 2010 Nov 1;89(11):1187-97. Demineralization is the removal of minerals (mainly calcium) from any of the hard tissues: enamel, dentine, and cementum.Li X, Wang J, Joiner A, Chang J. The remineralisation of enamel: a review of the literature. Journal of dentistry. 2014 Jun 30;42:S12-20. It begins at the surface, and may progress into either cavitation (tooth decay) or erosion (tooth wear). Tooth decay demineralisation is caused by acids from bacteria in the dental plaque biofilm whilst tooth wear is caused by acids from non-bacterial sources. These can be extrinsic in source, such as carbonated drinks or intrinsic acids, usually from stomach acid coming into the mouth. Both types of demineralisation will progress if the acid attacks continue unless arrested or reversed by remineralisation.Garcia- Godoy, F. & Hicks, J. (2008). Maintaining the integrity of the enamel surface. American Dental Association, 139(3).Hicks J, Garcia-Godoy F, Flaitz C. Biological factors in dental caries: role of saliva and dental plaque in the dynamic process of demineralization and remineralization (part 1). Journal of Clinical Pediatric Dentistry. 2004 Sep 1;28(1):47-52. Tooth decay process When food or drinks containing fermentable sugars enter the mouth, the bacteria in dental plaque rapidly feed on the sugars and produce organic acids as by-products. The glucose produced from starch by salivary amylase, is also digested by the bacteria. When enough acid is produced so that the pH goes below 5.5, the acid dissolves carbonated hydroxyapatite, the main component of tooth enamel.Fejerskov O, Nyvad B, Kidd EA: Pathology of dental caries; in Fejerskov O, Kidd EAM (eds): Dental caries: The disease and its clinical management. Oxford, Blackwell Munksgaard, 2008, vol 2, pp 20-48. The plaque can hold the acids in contact with the tooth for up to two hours, before it is neutralised by saliva. Once the plaque acid has been neutralised, the minerals can return from the plaque and saliva to the enamel surface. However, the capacity for remineralisation is limited, and if sugars enter the mouth too frequently a net loss of mineral from enamel produces a cavity, through which bacteria can infect the inner tooth and destroy the latticework. This process requires many months or years. Soi S, Roy AS, Vinayak V. Fluorides and Their Role in Demineralization and Remineralization. Principal‚Äôs Message.:19.  Natural tooth remineralisation   Role of saliva  Remineralization occurs on a daily basis after attack by acids from food, through the presence of calcium, phosphate and fluoride found in saliva.Nanci, A., & Ten Cate, A. (2008). Ten Cate's oral histology. St. Louis, Mo.: Mosby Elsevier. Saliva also acts as a natural buffer to neutralise acid, preventing demineralisation in the first place. If there is reduced saliva flow or reduced saliva quality, this will increase the risk of demineralization and create the need for treatment in order to prevent demineralisation progression. Saliva function can be organised into five major categories that serve to maintain oral health and create an appropriate ecologic balance: * Lubrication and protection * Buffering action and clearance * Maintenance of tooth integrity * Antibacterial activity * Taste and digestion. As the demineralisation process continues, the pH of the mouth becomes more acidic which promotes the development of cavities. Dissolved minerals then diffuse out of the tooth structure and into the saliva surrounding the tooth. The buffering capacity of saliva greatly impacts the pH of plaque surrounding the enamel, thereby inhibiting caries progression. Plaque thickness and the number of bacteria present determine the effectiveness of salivary buffers. The high salivary concentrations of calcium and phosphate which are maintained by salivary proteins may account for the development and remineralisation of enamel. The presence of fluoride in saliva speeds up crystal precipitation forming a fluorapatite- like coating which will be more resistant to caries.  Treatment and prevention  Besides professional dental care, there are other ways for promoting tooth remineralisation:  Fluoride  = Fluoride therapy = Fluoride is a mineral found naturally in rock, air, soil, plants and water and it assists by: * Protecting children and adults against tooth decay * Repairing early white spot lesions found on the tooth surface that may develop into cavities. * Helps prevent premature tooth loss of baby teeth due to decay and overall assists in guiding the adult teeth to correct tooth eruption. * Aids in the prevention of invasive dental treatment therefore reducing the amount of money spent on dental treatment * Provides an overall community advantage, especially individuals from low socioeconomic communities, who have less access to other forms of fluoride treatments * Evidence confirms that water fluoridation is a safe and effective way to help protect teeth against decay * The addition of fluoride to the water does not alter the taste or smell of the drinking water Fluoride therapy is often used to promote remineralisation. This produces the stronger and more acid- resistant fluorapatite, rather than the natural hydroxyapatite. Both materials are made of calcium. In fluorapatite, fluoride takes the place of a hydroxide.Better health channel. \\"Dental care - fluoride\\", April 2012. retrieved on 2016-04-15. =Effect of fluoride= The presence of fluoride in saliva and plaque fluid interacts with remineralisation process in many ways and thus exerts a topical or surface effect. A person living in an area with fluoridated water may experience rises of fluoride concentration in saliva to about 0.04 mg/L several times during a day. Technically, this fluoride does not prevent cavities but rather controls the rate at which they develop making them take a lot longer and making them easier to prevent via normal brushing as it will take a higher amount of acid, usually built up over a number of days, to destroy the created fluorapatite. When fluoride ions are present in plaque fluid along with dissolved hydroxyapatite, and the pH is higher than 4.5, a fluorapatite-like remineralised veneer is formed over the remaining surface of the enamel; this veneer is much more acid-resistant than the original hydroxyapatite, and is formed more quickly than ordinary remineralised enamel would be. The cavity-prevention effect of fluoride is partly due to these surface effects, which occur during and after tooth eruption. Fluoride interferes with the process of tooth decay as fluoride intake during the period of enamel development for up to 7 years of age; the fluoride alters the structure of the developing enamel making it more resistant to acid attack. In children and adults when teeth are subjected to the alternating stages of demineralisation and remineralisation, the presence of fluoride intake encourages remineralisation and ensures that the enamel crystals that are laid down are of improved quality.Dr RS Levine. \\"The British Fluoridation Society\\", A guide to the action of fluoride in the prevention of dental decay, 2016. retrieved on 2016-05-3. Fluoride is commonly found in toothpastes. Fluoride can be delivered to many parts of the oral cavity during brushing, including the tooth surface, saliva, soft tissues and remaining plaque biofilm. Some remineralisation methods may work for \\"white spot lesions\\" but not necessarily \\"intact tooth surfaces\\". =Fluoridated toothpaste= Regular use of a fluoridated toothpaste has been shown to provide a significant source of fluoride to the mouth by the means of direct fluoride contact to tooth structure. The types of fluoride added to toothpaste include: sodium fluoride, sodium monofluorophosphate (MFP), and stannous fluoride. As stated previously, fluoride has been proven to positively affect the remineralisation process. Therefore, by using an adequately fluoridated toothpaste regularly, this assists the remineralisation process of any hard tooth tissues. = Fluoride varnish = Fluoride varnishes were developed late 1960s and early 1970s and since then they have been used both as a preventative agent in public health programs and as a specific treatment for patients at risk of caries by the 1980s, mostly in European countries. Fluoride varnishes were developed primarily to overcome their shortcoming which is to prolong the contact time between fluoride and tooth surfaces. Furthermore, when compared to other existing topical fluoride the advantages of fluoride varnishes application are being a quick and easy procedure for the clinicians, reduced discomfort for the receiving patients, and greater acceptability by the patients. Fluoride varnishes are a concentrated topical fluoride containing 5% sodium fluoride (NaF) except the Fluor protector which contains difluorosilane. There are many types of fluoride varnishes and among them the popular brands are Duraphat and Fluor Protector. Currently, the anti- caries effect fluoride varnishes are backed up by Cochrane systematic reviews, 2002 which was updated in 2013 included 22 trials with 12,455 children aged 1‚Äì15 years old. The conclusion made is similar to its previous review, a 46% reduction in D(M)FS and 33% reduction in d (e/m)fs in permanent teeth and deciduous teeth respectively = Water fluoridation = Community water fluoridation is the addition of fluoride in the drinking water with the aim of reducing tooth decay by adjusting the natural fluoride concentration of water to that recommended for improving oral health. The NHMRC released the public statement of efficacy and safety of fluoridation 2007 to set the recommended water fluoridation to the target range of 0.6 to 1.1 mg/L, depending on climate, to balance reduction of dental caries (tooth decay) and occurrence of dental fluorosis (mottling of teeth). Moreover the public statement states that the fluoridation of drinking water is an effective way to ensure the community is exposed to fluoride and can benefit from its preventative role in tooth decay.National health and medical research council. \\"Health effects of water fluoridation\\", 2016-04-06. retrieved on 2016-04-11. Plaque control Oral hygiene practices involve the mechanical removal of plaque from hard tissue surfaces Darby ML, Walsh M. Dental hygiene: theory and practice. Elsevier Health Sciences; 2014 Apr 15. Cariogenic bacteria levels in the plaque determine whether caries will occur or not, therefore, effective removal of plaque is paramount. The removal of plaque inhibits demineralisation of teeth, and reversely increases opportunities for remineralisation. Diet Demineralization is caused by bacteria excreting acids as a product of their metabolism of carbohydrates. By reducing the intake frequency of carbohydrates in an individual's diet, remineralization is increased and demineralization is decreased. Diet control is an important aspect in promoting remineralization to occur naturally. A loss of the tooth enamel structure and cavitation may occur if the demineralization phase continues for a long period of time. This disturbance of demineralisation caused by the presence of fermentable carbohydrates continues until the saliva has returned to a normal pH and had sufficient time to penetrate and neutralize the acids within any cariogenic biofilm present.Arathi Rao, Neeraj Malhotra. \\"The Role of Remineralizing Agents in dentistry: A Review\\". Volume 32, Number 6. 2011. retrieved on 2016-05-22. Increased sugar consumption in the means of foods and drinks containing high levels of sugar are known to be associated with high rates of dental decay. As a result, members of the dental team routinely assess patients' diets and highlight areas where this could be improved to reduce the risk of dental decay. A balanced diet is an important contributing factor towards oral health and general health. It is common knowledge that certain dietary habits contribute to disease, whether patients take note of advice which is given to them and change their diet as a result, is less certain. Recent studies on diet and caries have been confounded by the widespread use of fluoride toothpastes. Studies have argued that with greater exposure to fluoride, the sugar consumption/caries relationship may be weaker in the modern age than previously thought, with fluoride raising the threshold of sugar intake at which caries progresses to cavitation. It has been concluded in modern societies that a significant relationship between sugars and caries persists despite the regular widespread use of fluoride toothpaste. Several reviews conclude that high sugar consumption continues to be the main threat for dental health of whole populations in some developed and many developing countries. Therefore, a key strategy to further reducing levels of caries in individuals as well as for populations, is by means of reducing the frequency of sugar intakes in the diet. Foods high in refined carbohydrates, such as concentrated fruit snack bars, sweets, muesli bars, sweet biscuits, some breakfast cereals and sugary drinks including juices can contribute to dental decay, especially if eaten often and over long periods as the sugar nourishes the cariogenic bacteria in mouth. The bacteria produce acid, which destroys teeth. Highly refined packaged foods such as savory crackers and chips can also have high levels of carbohydrates. It is important to check the nutritional information panel on packaged foods to determine which foods and drinks have high carbohydrate concentrations. To prevent demineralisation in the mouth, it is important for an individual to ensure they have a well- balanced diet, including foods containing calcium and foods that are low in acids and sugars. The individual should have a diet high in fresh fruits and vegetables, wholegrain cereals, legumes, seeds and nuts. Sugary snacks including lollies, fruit bars, muesli bars, biscuits, dried fruit, cordials, juices and soft drinks should be limited as they contribute to dental decay and dental erosion. Additionally, excessive starchy foods (such as bread, pasta, and crackers), fruits and milk products consumed frequently can cause the growth of dental plaque and bacteria. Therefore healthy eating, healthy drinking and proper maintenance of oral hygiene is the best way to promote and maintain sound tooth structure for an individual. Xylitol, Sorbitol, and Erythritol Xylitol is a naturally-occurring sweetener that can be synthetically produced in bulk. It is classified as a sugar alcohol. Xylitol inhibits acid production by oral bacteria and promotes remineralisation of the teeth. It can be found in various products which include chewing gums and lozenges. Xylitol has been found to reduce mutans streptococci in plaque and saliva and reduce the binding of these to the acquired enamel pellicle. This in turn leads to less adherent plaque and a decrease in acid production. In addition, chewing xylitol gum will stimulate increased salivary flow which in turn increases the amount of calcium in the saliva and enhances the oral clearance. Additional saliva flow which includes chewing products such as gums that contain no fermentable carbohydrates can aid in the modulation of plaque pH. Xylitol is a sugar alcohol which provides the sensation of tasting sweetness in foods, particularly chewing gum, without providing sucrose which is the only sugar that S.mutans are capable of using to produce the polyacrylamide adhesive which allows them bind to the teeth. Xylitol does not actively reduce or harm the presence or capacities of oral bacteria, but rather does not offer them the sustenance to propagate or function. There are often claims of significant dental benefits of Xylitol. These generally derive from the perspectives of; saliva production is increased during chewing and oral stimulation which can help to maintain a more adequate supply of saliva to support normal oral functioning. Also, the idea of Xylitol being a sweetener option which does not serve as fuel for oral bacteria is considered to be the healthier alternative than sucrose (table sugar), fructose, lactose, galactose products. While these considerations may not reverse any conditions in health, they are more so preventative, and do not further the consequential events such as dental caries, malodorous breath, excessive plaque and gingivitis conditions. Erythritol may have greater protective action than xylitol and sorbitol. However, this research is industry funded and not as comprehensive as the research on xylitol.  Biomimetic glass and ceramics  Biomimetic glass and ceramic particles, including amorphous calcium sodium phosphosilicate (CSPS, NovaMin) and amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP, Recaldent), are used in some toothpastes and topical preparations to promote remineralisation of teeth. These particles have a structure mimicking hydroxyapatite, providing new sites for mineralisation to occur. Their binding to the teeth also occludes open dentin tubules, helping to reduce dentin hypersensitivity. Evidence is insufficient to recommend either for any indications, but the evidence for CSPS is stronger than that for ACP. Oligopeptide P11-4 P11-4 (Ace-QQRFEWEFEQQ-NH2, Curolox) is a synthetic, pH controlled self-assembling peptide used for biomimetic mineralization e.g. for enamel regeneration or as an oral care agent. It has a high affinity to tooth mineral. P11-4 is a self-assembling Œ≤-peptide. It builds a 3-D bio- matrix with binding sites for Calcium-ions serving as nucleation point for hydroxyapatite (tooth mineral) formation. The high affinity to tooth mineral is based on matching distances of Ca-ion binding sites on P11-4 and Ca spacing in the crystal lattice of hydroxyapatite. The matrix formation is pH controlled and thus allows control matrix activity and place of formation. Self assembling properties of P11-4 are used to regenerate early caries lesions. By application of P11-4 on the tooth surface, the peptide diffuse through the intact hypomineralized plate into the early caries lesion body and start, due to the low pH in such a lesion, to self-assemble generating a peptide scaffold mimicking the enamel matrix. Around the newly formed matrix de-novo enamel-crystals are formed from calcium phosphate present in saliva. Through the remineralization caries activity is significantly reduced in comparison with a fluoride treatment alone. In aqueous oral care gels the peptide is present as matrix. It binds directly as matrix to the tooth mineral and forms a stable layer on the teeth. This layer does protect the teeth from acid attacks. It also occludes open dentin tubule and thus reduces the dental sensitivity.

Taxonomy and systematics Eugenius Johann Christoph Esper described the striped hawk-moth in 1780 using a specimen found in Italy at Livorno (hence the Latin name livornica). In 1819 Jacob H√ºbner allocated this species in his newly erected genus Hyles. Until the 20th century Hyles livornica has been considered conspecific with the American Hyles lineata and is therefore under that name (or as Celerio lineata ssp. livornica) found in the older literature. Similar was the case with the Hyles livornicoides, which is prevalent in Australia. Hyles renneri from Nepal is sometimes treated as a valid species. On the basis of DNA testing it is well established that H. livornica in its entire Afro-Palaearctic distribution forms a genetic and taxonomic unit. This results in the following relationships among the Palaearctic widespread species of the genus Hyles: Distribution This species is found in Africa, southern Europe, Poland, central and east Asia. Description Hyles livornica has a wingspan reaching 60‚Äì80 mm. Males are slightly smaller than females. The forewings and the body are mainly olive brown or beige, with white stripes. The hindwings are pink, with black and white edges. The head and the thorax are olive-brown, with white stripes. The olive-brown abdomen has black-and-white segment, the first two segments have large black and white side spots. The antennae are dark olive brown and have a white tip. These moths fly from February to October depending on the location. In Europe they are visible from April to June and from August to September in two generations and sometimes they overwinter. This species is a migrant from Africa to Europe. The caterpillars are green, with black markings and reach a length from 65 to 80 millimeters. Hyles livornica MHNT male Dos.jpg Male Hyles livornica MHNT male Ventre.jpgMale Hyles livornica MHNT femelle dos.jpg Female Hyles livornica MHNT femelle ventre.jpgFemale Biology The caterpillars feed on various plants, mainly on Galium, Gossypium, Rumex, Vitis, Euphorbia, Linaria, Epilobium, Antirrhinum, Scabiosa, Linum, Fuchsia and Asphodelus.

At the same time, in an unofficial capacity Starr became involved in the conditioning of horses. As an unlicensed trainer his first win in 1936 was not formally recognized as were the wins of other horses he trained between then and 1952 when he applied for his license. Yonnie Starr earned his first Canadian Horse of the Year honors in 1955 with Ace Marine, a colt whose wins included the three races that four years later were officially designated as the Canadian Triple Crown series. In all, Starr won ten official Triple Crown Classics including four Queen's Plates.Queen's Pl;ate at Woodbine Entertainment His horses earned ten Sovereign Awards and won a record seven Canadian Horse of the Year titles: Ace Marine (1955), Wonder Where (1959), Fanfreluche (1970), La Prevoyante (1972), L'Enjoleur (1974, 1975), L'Alezane (1977).Sovereign Award winners - Jockey Club of Canada Seven of the horses he trained were inducted in the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame with one of them also elected to the U.S. United States Racing Hall of Fame.National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame Although Starr trained horses of both sexes, he was recognized as someone who also had a special talent to develop fillies. During his career he trained horses with great success for prominent owners such as Conn Smythe and Larkin Maloney, both individually and for the Smythe/Maloney racing partnership. In the 1970s and 1980s Starr continued as a dominant force in Canadian racing as the trainer for Quebec sportsman, Jean-Louis Levesque. In addition to training for others, he owned a few horses and notably trained Unbranded who won the 1954 Jockey Club Cup Handicap. Yonnie Starr trained horses until his death in Florida in March 1990 at age eighty-four. At the time, he had been racing for the winter season at Gulfstream Park.

Career Following his studies, Bofinger worked as staff member to the Council of Economic Experts between 1978 and 1981. From 1984 until 1990, he was an economist at the Bundesbank. Since 1992, Bofinger has been a professor at the University of W√ºrzburg. Between 1997 and 1999, he served as Dean of the university‚Äôs Department of Economics. In 1997, he turned down an offer to move to the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich.

It is found in North Africa, the Canary Islands, Madeira, some islands in the Mediterranean Sea and in the mountains in Yemen. The length of the forewings is 45‚Äì85 mm. The larvae feed on Euphorbia. It is thought that Hyles tithymali had a much larger range in Europe, but has been pushed further south after the cooling 3600 years ago. Its place has been taken over by Hyles euphorbiae, which is more resistant to the cold. Because of this, many isolated populations exist today, many of which have developed into distinct subspecies. Subspecies The following subspecies are recognised: *H. t. tithymali (Boisduval, 1834) (Tenerife, Gran Canaria, Lanzarote and Fuerteventura islands) *H. t. mauretanica (Staudinger, 1871) (North Africa) *H. t. deserticola (Staudinger, 1901) (North Africa) *H. t. gecki (de Freina, 1991) (Madeira island) *H. t. phaelipae Gil-T. & Gil-Uceda, 2007 (El Hierro and La Palma islands) *H. t. himyarensis Meerman, 1988 (Yemen) *H. t. cretica (Eitschberger, Danner & Surholt, 1998) (Creta island) *H. t. gallaeci Gil-T., Requejo & Est√©vez, 2011 (north-western Iberian Peninsula, Galicia Region, Spain)  The taxon sammuti [=H. t. sammuti (Eitschberger, Danner & Surholt, 1998)] according to molecular studies is a hybrid from H. euphorbiae √ó H. tithymali.  Hyles tithymali cretica is regarded, according to authors, as a full species or as a hybrid from H. euphorbiae √ó H. tithymali.  The taxonomic final status of the taxon gallaeci Gil-T., Requejo & Est√©vez, 2011 (larvae very similar to other taxa of the tithymali group) is awaiting a study molecular (not only of its mitochondrial DNA, but also of its nuclear DNA).

The town had recently joined the Swiss Confederation, and was poised to become a thriving center for trade. In 1401, three members of the Hottinger family were named Burghers of the city. Their names Hans, Heinrich and Rudolf ‚Äì or, in their French variants, Jean, Henri and Rodolphe ‚Äì have marked the family dynasty for over 500 years. During the 15th and 16th centuries, their descendants oversaw the canton's progressive transformation from a rural to a financial economy, taking an active role in the region's political, cultural and religious life all the way into the 18th century.  Five generations of doctors and pastors (1467‚Äì1732)  Hans-Heinrich Hottinger (1620‚Äì1667), Dean of the University of Heidelberg His grandson S√©bastien Hottinger (1538‚Äì1600), was a doctor and deputy of the Zurich City Council. Hans-Heinrich Hottinger, S√©bastien Hottinger's brother, produced for his part an illustrious line of mathematicians, physicists, doctors, and theologians, among which Hans-Heinrich Hottinger (1620‚Äì1667), better known as Johann Heinrich Hottinger, a famous orientalist, historian, theologian and Dean of the University of Heidelberg. Wolfgang Hottinger's son, Hans-Rudolf (1600‚Äì1639) charted a new destiny for the Hottingers as clergymen. His son, Rudolf (1642‚Äì1692), and grandson Hans-Rudolf (1673‚Äì1732) also became pastors. Zurich rapidly prospered during the second half of the 17th century with the end of the Thirty Year War (1618‚Äì1648), the Treaty of Westphalia, and Switzerland's independence from the Holy Roman Empire proclaiming the Confederacy's neutrality. There is little surprise, therefore, that a branch of the Hottinger family would become involved in commerce and trade. It is from this branch that the financial dynasty would emerge.  Businessmen and politicians (1712‚Äì1764)  Johannes Hottinger was born in 1712, the sole surviving son among Hans-Rudolf and Verena Hottinger's five children. The year of Johannes's birth was marked by the end of the 2nd Battle of Villmergen, following which Zurich was fully able to capitalize on its position as a major European crossroads and trading center. Johannes's career would be further aided by the fact that his uncle, Christof Hottinger, was Deputy of the City Council for the powerful saffron corporation and Treasurer of the Grossm√ºnster. In 1734, Johannes married the daughter of Johann√®s Cramer, a draper and likewise Deputy of the City Council as representative of the saffron corporation. The couple's three sons ‚Äì Johann-Heinrich (1734‚Äì1808), Johannes (1738‚Äì1797) and Johann-Rudolf (1739‚Äì1809) would all be raised from an early age with a keen appreciation for trade and business. All three would marry the daughters of well-established merchants, and expanded their business by establishing relations with the Geneva banking house Passavant, de Candolle, Bertrand & Cie.  First steps in finance (1764‚Äì1784)  Johann- Konrad (1764‚Äì1841), or Jean-Conrad in its French version, was Johann-Rudolf Hottinger's second son, and the one who would definitively establish the family as a financial dynasty. Like many sons of wealthy Zurich families, he was sent to Mulhouse in 1779 for a traineeship with a cotton factory. But Jean-Conrad was less interested in cotton trading, silk printing or smelting than in impressing the economist M. Wolf, with whom he resided, with his aptitude for drawing and mathematics. As he became more and more interested in finance, Jean-Conrad eventually answered the call of his uncle Johann Heinrich Hottinger to join him in Geneva in 1783. Home to many Protestant banking firms, Geneva was certainly better suited to Jean-Conrad Hottinger‚Äôs aspirations. Thanks to his uncle‚Äôs connections, Jean-Conrad was able to train as a banker with Passavant, de Candolle, Bertrand & Cie. Over the ensuing years, Jean-Conrad Hottinger would display a thirst for knowledge and a deepening interest in the issue of public debt, notably in France and Great Britain. Soon he expressed a desire to go to Paris, following in the footsteps of Jacques Necker, director-general of the French royal finances.  From clerk to banker (1784‚Äì1787)  Baron Jean-Conrad Hottinguer (1764‚Äì1841) Jean- Conrad Hottinger left for the French capital that same year with a letter of introduction by his former employees. This enabled him to start clerking for Le Couteulx & Cie, a highly reputable business, which had been ennobled in the time of Louis XIV. Back in Zurich, a number of illustrious wealthy businessmen ‚Äì among whom Jean Conrad and Salomon Escher, Martin Usteri, and Jean Conrad Ott ‚Äì gathered in early 1786 to discuss how to invest in Paris and which banks to contact. Jean Conrad Escher put forward the name of Hottinger, ‚Äúthe son of Jean Rodophe Hottinger and a young clerk in the service of Le Couteulx.‚Äù Arriving in Paris, Jean Conrad and Salomon Escher met with Denis de Rougemont de Chatellois, at the head of an old Parisian banking house, which, at the time, was experiencing credit problems. The Eschers were therefore able to suggest a partnership with the person of their choice. They met with then 23-year-old Jean-Conrad Hottinger, and an immediate bond was forged between the three men. Within the short space of a meeting, Jean-Conrad went from banking clerk to bank owner. In September 1786, the creation of ‚ÄúRougemont, Hottinger & Cie‚Äù was announced. A few months later, in early 1787, the new bank was listed in the Royal Almanac, with offices at Rue Croix-des-Petits- Champs, H√¥tel de Beaupreaux.  The French Revolution (1788‚Äì1798)  The bank expanded markedly within months, and already differences appeared between the two associates: ‚ÄúM. Hottinger, highly intelligent and capable, aims to immediately make a fortune; I only wish to preserve mine,‚Äù wrote de Rougemont. Soon thereafter, de Rougemont encountered problems that cause the bank's Swiss underwriters, Usteri and Escher, to lose confidence in him. Arriving in Paris amidst social upheaval in 1788, they decide to break ranks with de Rougemont. The following month, however, a number of bankruptcies forced them to reconsider, and matters were further complicated the following year by the French Revolution. The split then became political, as Jean-Conrad Hottinger pushed to extend the assignats (notes issued as paper currency from 1789 to 1796 by the revolutionary government on the security of confiscated lands) to the financial world. Their partnership was effectively dissolved at end 1790. For his part, Jean-Conrad had already entered an agreement with the former banker of the King of Poland, Paul Sellouf in July 1790. But ageing and sick, Sellouf retired only a few months later, leaving Jean-Conrad with an extensive and select clientele. As of 15 October 1790, Jean-Conrad Hottinguer found himself the sole owner of a banking institution that bore his name. The following years were not without turmoil, however, even though Jean-Conrad Hottinguer eventually emerged unscathed. According to The World of Private Banking, he left Paris in 1794 to pursue business opportunities in the United States. ‚ÄúWhen he came back to Paris in 1798, he founded ‚ÄúHottinguer & Co.‚Äù and soon thereafter opened branches at Le Havre [1802] and other French ports. He became a financial advisor of Talleyrand and is known as one of the first regents of the Banque de France.‚Äù  Establishing a financial dynasty (1798‚Äì1832)  Napoleon I of France names Jean-Conrad Hottinguer Baron of the Empire Jean-Conrad Hottinguer ‚Äì a ‚Äòu‚Äô had been added to the name to preserve the Germanic pronunciation of the name ‚Äì continued to profit from his knowledge of the issue of public debt. In particular, he took a strong interest in the new commercial laws promulgated by Napoleon as of 1807. Shortly thereafter, in the throes of several victories, the Emperor decided to bestow titles and honors on affluent members of society. Marshals were named dukes, ministers were named counts, and mayors, bankers and bishops became barons. On 19 September 1810, Jean-Conrad Hottinguer was named Baron of the Empire. He went on to have six daughters and two sons. The eldest, Jean-Henri, inherited the title and the family business. Born in 1803, Jean-Henri Hottinguer took over his father's position at the head of the bank in January 1833. Jean-Conrad had by now born out Napoleon's defeat ‚Äì playing no small role in handling France's massive war debt ‚Äì as well as the July Revolution of 1830. The family fortune was made, and Jean-Henri's focus would be to expand business abroad.  Entering the Industrial Age (1833‚Äì1866)  Baron Jean- Henri Hottinguer (1803‚Äì1866) Jean-Henri's life was at least as eventful and adventurous as his father's. He traveled to England when he was only 15 years old. At the age of 23, he sailed to New Orleans to establish new trade business with America, made possible by the bank's fleet of ships built by his father. He then made his way to Washington D.C. by steamboat, carriage and rail. In 1832, Jean-Henri married Caroline Delessert, the daughter of Baron Fran√ßois Delessert. In 1818, Jules Paul Benjamin Delessert and Hottinguer created the first savings company and contingency fund in France for modest earners ‚Äì a precursor to pension funds ‚Äì called ‚ÄúCaisse d‚Äô√©pargne et de pr√©voyance.‚Äù Caroline was the last in the line of the Delessert financial dynasty, and Jean-Henri Hottinguer took over the bank in 1848. His travels did not end after taking over the reins of the family business. He was quick to recognize the potential of the new technologies of his time, notably electricity, and participated in many of the business ventures linked to the economic development of Europe in the mid-19th century. Jean-Henri was notably instrumental in developing the French railway system, as well as, in 1852, contributing in the creation of the French waterworks company, the Compagnie G√©n√©rale des Eaux, known today as Veolia Environment. He also invested in Russia and was involved in restructuring Mexico‚Äôs finances in the early years of the French intervention.  Difficult times (1867‚Äì1950)  Baron Rodolphe Hottinguer (1835‚Äì1920) Jean-Henri Hottinguer died in 1866, leaving the bank in the hands of his son, Rodolphe Hottinguer (1835‚Äì1920), who had led a group of six European financiers in meetings with the Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire, resulting in the creation, in 1863, of the Ottoman Bank (today part of Grindlays Bank). Hottinguer & Cie. survived due to its continued involvement in the major financial events of the time, as well as Rodolphe Hottinguer's inherited interest and knowledge of the issue of public debt. In 1890, the bank celebrated its centennial, as Rodolphe Hottinger continued to pursue his father's preoccupation with the development of France's industrial infrastructure. He occupied the position of Vice President of the Paris-Lyon- M√©dit√©rann√©e (PLM) railway. By the time of World War I, Rodolphe could rely on the help of his son Henri Hottinguer (1868‚Äì1943), who was present in 1919 at the signing of the Armistice with Germany, and on whose shoulders would fall the task of coping with the Great Depression. In turn, Henri relied on his son, Rodolphe Hottinguer (1902‚Äì1985), during World War II. As he worked hard to keep the business afloat and preserve the family domain of Castle Piple, Rodolphe consigned his memories of the war to a black notebook. These memories include retrieving a list of Hottinguer employees from a German employment office at Chateaudun, and racing down a deserted Rue Royale in Paris, in August 1944, chased by a truck full of German soldiers.  The modern era (1950‚Äì2015), international expansion and decline of the Swiss bank  Baron Rodolphe Hottinguer (1902‚Äì1985) With Baron Rodolphe Hottinguer (1902‚Äì1985), the bank embraced a modern approach to banking. He managed to preserve the tradition of private banking and the qualities of a family-oriented, human size institution. In 1945, Hottinguer & Cie. in Paris joined in creating the Drouot insurance company, which would merge with Mutuelles Unies in 1982 to form AXA. Rodolphe Hottinguer occupied posts as Vice-Chairman of the Paris Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Chairman of the International Chamber of Commerce, Chairman of the European Banking Federation and, for more than 35 years, Chairman of the French Banking Association now called F√©d√©ration Bancaire Fran√ßaise. Rodolphe Hottinguer died in 1985 leaving his son, Henri, a banking legacy in solid shape and sound condition. The Banque Hottinguer in Paris was sold to the Credit Suisse in 1997. In 1968, Baron Henri Hottinguer (1934‚Äì2015), Rodolphe's son, returned to Zurich and founded Hottinger & Cie, Zurich, and with the help of his sons, Rodolphe and Fr√©d√©ric Hottinger, they started the Swiss and the international development of the Hottinger Banking Group. They founded Hottinger Capital Corp in New-York, opened a Geneva branch in 1987, and managed Hottinger Capital SA in Geneva as of 1998. A year later, they initiated a proactive international policy, based on a system of strategic partnerships, or ‚Äúaffiliated companies,‚Äù to expand the bank's reach without unduly expanding its size.\\"Une strat√©gie internationale volontariste\\" by Eric Grant in Banque et Finance no 93, sept/oct 2008. The Hottinger Banking Group had branches in Basel, Brig, Geneva, New-York, Sion, Zurich and wholly separate and independently capitalised Hottinger businesses in London, Luxembourg and Nassau. In 2007, as Paul Hottinguer retired, two first cousins of the Hottinguer family became partners of the Bank: Paul de Pourtales became Managing Partner, and Jonathan Bowdler-Raynar as Limited Partner. In December 2009 Baron Rodolphe Hottinger left the Hottinger Banking Group and created La Financi√®re Rodolphe Hottinger SA. In May 2010, to prepare the future challenges of the new financial environment, the bank became Hottinger & Cie SA with the arrival of new partners. The Swiss division of Hottinger Banking Group closed its doors for the last time in October 2015, due to the increased regulatory demands in Switzerland.  Acquisitions and divestments (2015present)  Following the death of Baron Henri Hottinger (1934‚Äì2015) his son, Fr√©d√©ric Hottinger inherited the majority of his father's estate, in particular, Groupe Financi√®re Hottinger and Co (established in 1981 and chaired by the Baron). In February 2019, a majority stake in the Bahamas division Of Hottinger Group (Hottinger Banking & Trust) was sold to Ansbacher Private Bank. The sale was not without contention as a minority shareholder objected to the sale and legal proceedings with Vernes Holdings ensued. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) approved the merger of Hottinger and Archimedes in July 2016 to form Hottinger Group. The Luxembourg division of Groupe Financi√®re Hottinger & Co was not part of the merger creating Hottinger Group. In 2017, Iteram Investments, a fund management business, merged with Hottinger Luxembourg. Fr√©d√©ric Hottinger remained a shareholder in Hottinger Group and became a board member of Iteram Investments.

Games air across Sportsnet and its sister national services Sportsnet One and Sportsnet 360. Select Blue Jays and other U.S. teams' games can be broadcast on TVA Sports (Sportsnet's French-language partner). * Rights to ESPN's Monday Night Baseball, Wednesday Night Baseball, and Sunday Night Baseball are held by TSN and RDS (French) * In French, postseason games are equally split between RDS and TVA Sports.

MLB Network is also available on some providers. *The MLB Extra Innings subscription package is available through most Canadian television providers, as well as MLB.tv.  International  * KBO: TSN Basketball National Basketball Association The NBA's Canadian marketing arm is managed by Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment, parent company of the Toronto Raptors. In turn, MLSE is majority-owned by Bell Canada and Rogers Communications; as such, coverage is mostly shared between their co-owned TSN and Sportsnet networks, along with the MLSE-owned NBA TV Canada. Toronto Raptors games are primarily aired by TSN, TSN2 and RDS, with selected games airing on Sportsnet, Sportsnet One, or Sportsnet 360. Ancillary Raptors content, including game encores, air on NBA TV Canada. All broadcasters air assorted non-Raptors games throughout the season (TSN promoted that it would air 148 regular-season games in total during the 2017-18 season); NBA TV Canada typically airs selected games and simulcasts of games from U.S. broadcasters (most often from its U.S. counterpart). All remaining games are available through the NBA League Pass out-of-market sports package. TSN and NBA TV have the Canadian TV rights to broadcast the NBA Summer League and NBA G League. TSN, Sportsnet and NBA TV have the Canadian TV rights to broadcast the WNBA. U.S. college basketball TSN owns the Canadian broadcast rights to the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament through a deal with ESPN International. CBS coverage of the tournament is also available in Canada. TSN also simulcast regular-season games from ESPN. Coverage of games is also available from U.S. networks carried in Canada, such as Big Ten Network and CBS Sports Network, along with broadcast network coverage or syndicated packages.

DAZN also distributes the NFL Sunday Ticket service in Canada; while DAZN initially planned to only distribute a digital out-of-market product in Canada, the company backtracked and revived Sunday Ticket following user complaints over the quality of its streams. Due to Canadian regulations that permit stations from different areas to be carried in the same market, several games may be available in each of the Sunday timeslots through a combination of domestic and American stations from different areas, without a subscription to Sunday Ticket. By contrast, outside a handful of areas where multiple neighbouring network affiliates are available, no more than three games may be aired in a given U.S. market on any Sunday afternoon (up to four games in week 17). Canadian university football As of 2019, CBC Sports and TVA Sports broadcasts the national U Sports playoff games, namely the Mitchell Bowl, the Uteck Bowl, and the Vanier Cup, succeeding Sportsnet (who aired it from 2013 to 2018). TVA Sports carries many QSSF games. In 2016, Sportsnet's sister broadcast network City began broadcasting a four-game U Sports Game of the Week package. Games not covered by these contracts are often carried by local cable community channels. In 2015, Global aired a Hardy Trophy semi-final and championship game as part of the Shaw TV (Shaw Cable) Canada West conference package (at the time, Shaw directly owned Global). As of the 2017-18 season, Canada West conference rights are held by the three major IPTV providers in Central Canada‚ÄîBell MTS Fibe TV, SaskTel MaxTV and Telus TV (including a regular season package and playoff coverage). U.S. college football Many ESPN College Football games are aired by TSN's feeds, including the regular season and most bowl games (which were, in the past, shared with Sportsnet 360, and not withstanding conflicts with other programming such as the World Junior Hockey Championship), and all College Football Playoff bowls. TSN also carries College GameDay. Coverage of games is also available from U.S. networks carried in Canada, such as NFL Network (Conference USA), Big Ten Network (Big Ten Conference) and CBS Sports Network (Conference USA, Mountain West Conference, Arizona Bowl, and Cure Bowl), along with broadcast network coverage. An out-of-market sports package offered by some providers includes other games from U.S. outlets that are not otherwise available in Canada (such as Fox Sports Networks, and ESPN games not picked up by the TSN channels). FloSports carries some Fox College Football broadcasts, while DAZN carries content from Pac-12 Network.

It carries streaming coverage of all PGA Tour events (including early-window PGA Tour Live blocks) and other ancillary content. Hockey National Hockey League Rogers Communications is the sole national rightsholder of the NHL in Canada as of the 2014‚Äì15 NHL season. Most national telecasts air on Sportsnet properties, and include, but are not limited to: * Hockey Night in Canada:Exclusive national window for Canadian teams on Saturday nights, multiple games airing across CBC Television, City, and Sportsnet channels. ** In rare circumstances, due to non-hockey programming conflicts, the Sportsnet regional channels may air different games. However, all four Sportsnet regional channels are available nationwide through the digital services of most providers. * Scotiabank Wednesday Night Hockey; Exclusive national Wednesday-night game on Sportsnet. * Rogers Hometown Hockey: National Sunday- night game on Sportsnet, with a travelling pre-game show broadcast from various Canadian cities. * Simulcasts of all-U.S. games from regional sports networks and NHL on NBC coverage (primarily on Thursday nights), including NBC's Sunday-afternoon games and the Winter Classic. * Stanley Cup Playoffs coverage; early rounds divided between CBC and Sportsnet. All games from the conference finals onward are simulcast by both networks. * Canadian distribution and marketing rights to the NHL.tv (Rogers NHL Live) and NHL Centre Ice services, which carries out-of-market games and U.S. nationally televised games not aired by Sportsnet channels. * Hockey Night in Canada: Punjabi Edition: Coverage of selected Hockey Night in Canada games with Punjabi language commentary on Omni Television. * Since 2019, the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network (APTN) simulcasts selected Hometown Hockey games with commentary in the Plains Cree language. French-language rights were sub- licensed to Quebecor Media; all coverage airs on TVA Sports. La super soir√©e LNH serves as the flagship broadcast on Saturday nights, typically featuring the Montreal Canadiens. =Regional= Canadian teams also contract with local or regional broadcasters for selected pre-season and regular season games not covered by the national contracts. These deals are separate from the national rights deal, and may cover up to 60 regular-season games per season. Rights are current as of the 2020‚Äì21 NHL season. *Vancouver Canucks: Sportsnet Pacific *Edmonton Oilers: Sportsnet West *Calgary Flames: TBD *Winnipeg Jets: TSN3 *Toronto Maple Leafs: Sportsnet Ontario (16 games), TSN4 (26 games) (English) ** Rights to the Maple Leafs' regional telecasts are divided equally between TSN and Sportsnet (whose parent companies own a joint majority stake in the team's parent company). Of Sportsnet's 26 regional Leafs games, ten are broadcast nationally in conjunction with Rogers' national NHL rights, with Molson Canadian as presenting sponsor. ** The team-owned Leafs Nation Network airs replays and other ancillary coverage of the team. *Ottawa Senators: TSN5 and RDS/RDS2 *Montreal Canadiens: TSN2 and RDS Each team's regional game broadcasts are restricted to viewers of that team's designated home broadcast region as assigned by the NHL. Outside said region, these broadcasts are made available exclusively through NHL Centre Ice (TV) or Rogers NHL Live (streaming). If the originating channel is available outside a team's region (e.g. out-of-market Sportsnet feeds), the game broadcasts must be blacked out in these other areas. Sportsnet also operates part-time channels for the Canucks, Flames, and Oilers in case of scheduling conflicts: these channels are tied to the Sportsnet One licence. During the period that it held the rights, Sportsnet used City station CJNT as the overflow channel for Canadiens games instead. Under previous (2002‚Äì14) rights deals with RDS, the Canadiens forwent a separate regional rights contract (at the time of its establishment, RDS was the only national French-language sports channel in Canada) and allowed all of its games to be broadcast nationally in French in conjunction with RDS's package. With the transition to TVA Sports as national rightsholder, the Canadiens chose to negotiate a 12-year regional rights deal with RDS (the team is partially owned by the channel's parent BCE Inc.) in the team's designated broadcast region. U.S. teams in close proximity to the Canada‚ÄìUS border are now also able to sell Canadian regional broadcast rights to their games. As of the 2013‚Äì14 season, Bell Satellite TV and Bell Fibe TV own regional rights to Buffalo Sabres broadcasts for portions of Canada within a 50-mile radius of First Niagara Center, approximately stretching from Niagara Falls to the community of Stoney Creek in Hamilton. Sabres game broadcasts are available to Bell TV subscribers in this region at no extra cost, and moreover are no longer available as part of the NHL Centre Ice package through other providers serving this region. The Detroit Red Wings, whose market borders on Windsor, Ontario, is presumably able to sell similar rights but has not yet done so. As with other sports properties, game broadcasts on U.S. terrestrial stations carried in Canada, such as the NBC broadcast network's national rights package. Canadian Hockey League Sportsnet and TVA Sports airs the Memorial Cup tournament and selected other games from across the CHL's member leagues, primarily on Saturday afternoons (CHL Saturday Showcase). Many regular-season games are aired locally by the applicable cable community channels. Other events *TSN and RDS holds broadcast rights to national championships and most international events sanctioned by Hockey Canada, including but not limited to IIHF world championships, the Telus Cup (men's U18), Centennial Cup (men's junior A), Esso Cup (women's U18) and the Allan Cup (senior). In 2020, TSN renewed its rights through the 2033-34 season. *Spengler Cup: TSN *Champions Hockey League: TSN *American Hockey League: Toronto Marlies games are carried by Leafs Nation Network, and occasionally simulcast by TSN networks.

The deal includes a national window on Fridays and Saturdays, and selected Saturday games simulcast on CTV. Through separate rights deals negotiated with individual teams, TSN also holds rights to all Toronto FC and Vancouver Whitecaps FC matches (there are no regional blackouts on these games, meaning that these games air nationally as well). All other matches are available on the streaming service DAZN. As of the 2017 season, TVA Sports is the French- language national rightsholder, and is the broadcaster of all Montreal Impact matches.

He attended Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut from 1950 to 1954, where he was the first blind student to graduate. He then attended Boston University from 1956 to 1958, where he studied with Margaret Charloff. Mackay also studied with Lennie Tristano in New York City, then at the Lenox School of Jazz where he studied with Bill Evans, and lastly at The Hartford School of Music where he studied with Asher Zlotnik.[ Allmusic biography by Scott Yanow]Sightless Prober of the Piano's Wonders, The Hartford Courant, Aug. 17th, 1958, Jack Bishop In the mid-1960s, Mackay joined the Hindustani Jazz Sextet with Don Ellis, Harihar Rao, who played sitar and tabla, vibraphonist Emil Richards, drummer Steve Bohannon, bassists Chuck Domanico and Ray Neapolitan. The band performed mainly original compositions which had titles like \\"Sweet Nineteen\\", \\"Turks Works\\", and \\"Bombay Bossa Nova\\". Mackay also played with the Don Ellis Orchestra in the mid-1960s. The Don Ellis Orchestra was distinguished by its unusual instrumentation (which in its early days had up to three bassists and three drummers), incorporated Indian musical elements into modern big-band writing, and different time signatures such as 5/4, 7/8, and 9/4, and more complex rhythmic cycles like 19/4 and 27/16 and its occasionally wacky humor (highlighted by an excess of false endings) and an openness towards using rock rhythms. In 1966, the Don Ellis Orchestra earned a place at the Monterey Jazz Festival. Following this successful breakthrough performance, the band performed at the Pacific Jazz Festival in October 1966, and at Shelly's Manne Hole in March 1967, releasing segments of each on 1967s Live in 3 2/3 4 Time (Pacific Jazz).The new rhythm book, Don Ellis, 1972Ellis, Don. Quarter Tones: a text with musical examples, exercises and etudes. Harold Branch Publishing: Plainview, Long Island, New York, 1975, p. 17Leonard Feather, From Satchmo to Miles. New York: Stein and Day, 1972, p219-220 In the late-1960s, Mackay and Vicky Hamilton formed a duo and produced three recordings together. The albums include sunshine pop and the groovy side of jazz in many odd time signatures. The duo sings together on most of their tracks, with a mixed male/female vocal approach. Mackay plays Fender Rhodes and piano on the albums. The tunes are mostly originals penned by the pair, and instrumentation on the record includes flute and saxes from Ira Schulman and guitar from Joe Pass.Dusty Groove In the mid-1970s, Dave Mackay, Bill Henderson, and Joyce Collins formed a unique trio which toured the northwest and gained favorable reviews. The trio recorded two Grammy nominated albums for Discovery: Street of Dreams (1980) and Johnny Mercer Tribute. In 1981, Mackay, Henderson, and Collins performed their music on the television show \\"Ad Lib\\", hosted by composer and pianist Phil Moore.AHUH ProductionsThe Internet Movie Database www.imdb.com In the late-1980s, Dave Mackay, Lori Bell, and Ron Satterfield formed the group \\"Interplay\\". Their first album titled Interplay was selected on the Grammy ballot in four categories, including Best Instrumental Composition; Dave Mackay ‚Äì (Joyful), Best Instrumental Solo; Dave Mackay ‚Äì (Joyful), and best Jazz Instrumental Performance of a Group; \\"Interplay\\". The group's second album is titled Dave Mackay and Interplay, Live at the New York Grill. In the 1990s, Dave Mackay teamed up with Stephanie Haynes. The duo recorded a CD called Two On A Swing for Why Not Records. On their CD, Mackay is sometimes only barely hinting at the more conventional chords to the standards with hair-raising accompaniment. The interplay between voice and piano on \\"Easy to Love\\" and the witty \\"Everything But You\\" are high points on this very satisfying and sometimes unpredictable CD.CD universe ,http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/music/artist/Stephanie+Haynes/a/albums.htm, Scott Yanow In the 2000s Mackay teamed up with John Giannelli on bass and Joe Correro on drums performing Bill Evans tunes in a celebration of the Life and Music of bassist Scott LaFaro. The trio recorded one of the shows at Giannelli Square. In the 2000s, Mackay also teamed up with bassist Kenny Wild and singer Tierney Sutton performing at the LA Jazz Club Monteleons. Typical set included the songs I Can't Get Started, Evergreen, Spring Is Here, Cherokee, It Never Entered My Mind, Moon and Sand, Only the Lonely, Blue Skies, I've Never Been in Love Before, Summer Me, Winter Me, and With Every Breath I Take. The Jazz critic Roger Crane described the music as \\"sounds of surprise\\".Tierney Sutton At Monteleone's, All About Jazz, November 1998, By Roger Crane In the 2010s, Dave teamed up with singer Miki Purnell, Tamir Hendelman, Lori Bell, Joey Carano, Bob Magnusson, Kevin Cox, and Tony Aros. The team recorded the album \\"Swingin' to the Sea\\" Mackay has also performed with Serge Chaloff, Sonny Stitt, Bob Wilber, Bobby Hackett, Jim Hall, Don Ellis, Emil Richards, Shelly Manne, Chet Baker, Joe Pass, Warne Marsh, Kai Winding, Stephanie Haynes, and Tierney Sutton at some of the top Jazz clubs in the country including, Boston's Storeyville and Jazz Workshop, New York's Left Bank and Village Vanguard, and Chicago's Mr. Kelly's, Shelly's Manne Hole, The Lighthouse, Donte's Jazz Supper Club, and the Samoa House.Jazz Musician Dave Mackay '54 Listens, Learns and Loves, by Carlin Carr, Trinity Reporter Winter 2007Remarkable Pianist Shaped a Vocalist, Hartford Courant - Hartford, Conn. Author: Owen McNally January 15, 2009 Mackay's original compositions include \\"Love Will Win\\", \\"Melissa\\", \\"Hands\\", \\"Joyful\\", \\"Blues for Polly-O\\", \\"Three for Five\\", \\"Blessings and Free\\", Samba For Vicky\\", \\"Now\\" and \\"Here\\". \\"Now\\" and \\"Here\\" were later recorded by Cal Tjader, and \\"Samba For Vicky\\" was later recorded by the Baja Marimba Band. In addition Dave co-wrote \\"Like Me\\", \\"Peek- A-Boo\\" and \\"Will-O-The-Wisp\\". Mackay also wrote a majority of the music (with lyricist Barbara Schill) for a hit stage musical comedy entitled \\"Is It Just Me, Or Is It Hot In Here?\\" (music by Dave Mackay & Barbara Schill; book & lyrics by Barbara Schill). It appeared to sold out audiences (1995‚Äì1998) first at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, then CBS Studio Center in Burbank, the Odyssey Theatre and Century City Playhouse.HOT FLASH!

The species was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae. It is found in Europe, North Africa and western Asia. left Caterpillar The wingspan is . The moth flies from May to July depending on the location. The forewings are ochreous with a faint olive tinge; the front margin is edged and blotched with pinkish, and there is a broad but irregular band of the same colour on the outer margin. The hindwings are blackish on their upper margin, pinkish on their outer margin, and ochreous tinged with olive between. The fringes are chequered whitish, sometimes tinged with pink. The head, thorax, and body are pinkish, more or less variegated with olive; the thorax has a patch of white hairs above the base of the wings. It is highly variable in colouration. In drier and warmer and arid areas of Asia Minor and Central Asia the pink colouration is absent. Form rosea Zerny is intermediate; f. indistincta Tutt is pinkish grey; f. suellus is yellowish sandy buff. The larva is greyish brown or darker grey, merging into yellowish brown on the front rings. The head is greyer than the body. The usual sphingid horn is absent, and in its place there is a double wart. In the early instars the caterpillar is pale greyish green with blackish bristles, and the head and under surface are yellowish. The larvae feed on Galium and Epilobium.  Similar species  D. porcellus is often confused with Deilephila elpenor, the elephant hawk moth. D. porcellus is the smaller of the two species, and other characteristics in size and coloring can be used to distinguish between the two. For example, D. porcellus has more yellow around its body and lacks the thick pink stripe that goes down D. elpenor abdomen. Ecology It is found in Europe coastal areas, heaths and meadowland edges where Galium is present. Up to 1600 m in the Alps and Spain but in North Africa, Turkey up to 2000 m.

He played for Manly-Warringah and Eastern Suburbs and coached the Gold Coast Seagulls and the Salford City Reds. Harvey primarily played at . Playing career Harvey was a Manly junior who grew into a hard-hitting prop with a reputation for a high-arm action when making a shoulder charge. Harvey played in two grand-finals while at Manly, in the 1976 win over Parramatta. Harvey was selected to represent Australia for one Test in 1978 against New Zealand but spent the whole game on the interchange bench. He played in the 1978 NSWRFL season's Grand Final draw and subsequent win over Cronulla-Sutherland. Harvey had a further chance that year to play in an international when he was selected for the 1978 Kangaroo tour, but he created some controversy when he declined the selection due to personal reasons. After receiving an offer which doubled his Manly pay-packet, Harvey signed with Easts in 1979. He played in Easts losing 1980 grand final side and remained with the club until the end of 1982 when he \\"went bush\\". In 1983, Harvey captain-coached the Tweed Heads Seagulls for a season, winning the Group 18 premiership as well as the Country Rugby League's Clayton Cup. Bob Fulton made Harvey an offer to return to Manly in 1984 but his playing contract wasn't extended for the following season and Harvey returned to country football once more. Harvey continued to play in NSW country leagues until 1992, with seasons at Forster-Tuncurry Hawks, Tweed Heads Seagulls and Wee Waa. He captain- coached the Tweed Head Seagulls to another Clayton Cup win in 1989. Harvey finished his playing career at Wee Waa, leading the team to a grand final victory in the Group 4 competition at the age of 37. Coaching career Harvey returned to the Gold Coast as a coach in 1994, succeeding Wally Lewis. The club was rebranded and became the Gold Coast Chargers in 1996 and Phil Economidis took over from John Harvey as coach. In May 1999, Harvey replaced Andy Gregory as head coach at the Salford City Reds in the Super League. After the club avoided relegation at the end of the 1999 season, Harvey was given a contract for a further season.

It was first published by Dutton in 2007. Plot summary Crusade, like Brethren before it, follows Will Campbell, a Templar involved in a secret order known as the Anima Templi, as he tries to secure peace in the Holy Land with the help of Kalawun, a high-ranking officer in the Mamluk court ruled by Sultan Baybars. Both of these men face plots from within their own organisations to throw the Holy Land into war: in Acre, Will must stop a cabal of merchants seeking to start a war by stealing the Muslim relic known as the Black Stone; while in Egypt, Baybars' son Baraka Khan and soothsayer Khadir al-Mihrani are plotting to overthrow Baybars and redouble the attack on the last remaining Franks in the Holy Land. Meanwhile, Will's childhood friend, Garin de Lyons, is now in the employ of King Edward I and has returned to Acre to extort money from the Anima Templi and to pursue his own, more selfish ends; and Will faces a threat from Baybars as the sultan gets nearer and nearer to discovering that it was Will who, many years before, ordered an assassination attempt which had failed but had taken the life of Baybars' closest friend.

In a positive review for on-line review site My Shelf, John Washburn stated that Young was \\"careful to maintain historical accuracy while at the same time bringing her characters to life in a brilliant manner.\\". He claimed to be \\"mesmerized by the brutal emotion found in this book, much in the same way I was with the first book.\\" and ended the review with \\"I am more than pleased, and I eagerly anticipate the third installment.\\". These sentiments were mirrored by A. Jurek, writing for Curled Up, who stated that \\"the plot moves swiftly despite complexities and complications exploding on each page.\\"; praising Young's \\"use of dramatic irony\\" and, of the characters, stated that \\"they are complex, human, and deeply flawed, driven as they are by their flaws to commit unspeakable betrayals and barbarities for the sake of ideals, hoping to achieve some good with their questionable acts.\\". In a mostly positive review for Reviewing the Evidence, Christine Zibas stated that \\"For those who are particularly interested in this historical time frame, Crusade is sure to pique their interest; for the more general reader, it may require a bit more slogging through the first part of the story to get truly involved in the book's characters and action.\\". Andre Delicata, writing for Malta's The Times was a little more critical of the novel, stating that the novel's problem is that \\"there is simply too much setting with meticulous descriptions where everything is dealt with in equal depth, resulting in a text with several climaxes and anti-climaxes but no real focus.\\", and that without this \\"modulation of detail\\" the reader is simply left with an \\"information overload\\". Delicata also comments that \\"if the spirit of an age is what you're after, then look no further than Crusade, which captures it voluminously and thoroughly satisfies those with a passion of detail verging on the obsessive.\\".

It is believed to emanate from Luton, Bedfordshire, in eastern England, where men in the area worked predominantly in the hattery business, which used mercury in the hat making process. The accumulation of mercury in the body causes symptoms similar to madness. The earliest known appearance of the phrase in print is in an 1829 issue of Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine.  Etymology  The origin of the saying may derive from: *Mercury poisoning of hat-makers ‚Äì A popular explanation of the phrase suggests that it was connected to mercury poisoning or Korsakoff's syndrome experienced by hat-makers as a result of the long-term use of mercury products in the hat-making trade. In 18th and 19th century England mercury was used in the production of felt, which was used in the manufacturing of hats common of the time. A late 19th-century example of the effect occurred with hatters in Danbury, Connecticut who developed a condition known locally as the Danbury Shakes. The condition was characterized by slurred speech, tremors, stumbling, and, in extreme cases, hallucinations.Mercury Workshop, p. 23, Ohio Indoor Air Quality Coalition, 2008. \\"In the late 1800s hat makers, or hatters, used to use mercury nitrate when working with beaver fur to make felt. Over time, the hatters started exhibiting apparent changes in personality and also experienced tremors or shaking. Mercury poisoning attacks the nervous system, causing drooling, hair loss, uncontrollable muscle twitching, a lurching gait, and difficulties in talking and thinking clearly. Stumbling about in a confused state with slurred speech and trembling hands, affected hatters were sometimes mistaken for drunks. The ailment became known as 'The Danbury Shakes' in the community of Danbury where hat making was a major industry. In very severe cases, they experienced hallucinations. The term ‚Äúmad as a hatter‚Äù may be a product of mercury toxicity. The practice did not completely stop until 1943.\\" * An incidence of nominalization of the verb hatter, which means \\"To harass; to weary; to wear out with fatigue.\\" according to Samuel Johnson's A Dictionary of the English Language published in 1755. In the text he cites a passage from the work of John Dryden as an example of usage: \\"He's hatter'd out with pennance.\\" * Roger Crab, a 17th-century hermit who, after working for a short time as a hatter, gave all his goods to the poor and wore homemade sackcloth clothes. Although this was presaged by political and religious radicalism, and was followed by a long married life. * An adaptation of the Anglo-Saxon word atter meaning poison, closely related to the word adder for the poisonous Crossed Viper. Lexicographers William and Mary Morris in Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins (1977) favour this derivation because \\"mad as a hatter\\" was known before hat making was a recognized trade. According to A Dictionary of Common Fallacies (1980), \\"'mad' meant 'venomous' and 'hatter' is a corruption of 'adder', or viper, so that the phrase 'mad as an atter' originally meant 'as venomous as a viper'.\\" * Historical significance: Abraham Lincoln was shot by John Wilkes Booth, and Booth was shot by Boston Corbett. Corbett spent his early life as a hat maker, and it is believed that the effects of his early life job affected his decision-making for his future. He was considered \\"mad as a hatter\\" for going against orders when he had Booth cornered in a barn in Virginia, and shooting Booth instead of taking him alive. After investigation, Corbett was forgiven for his disobedience, but left the army and went back to hat making. After a few years, Corbett was even more mad than people had once thought, and he was thrown into an insane asylum. Corbett managed to escape, and he was never seen again.  Early uses  In a section of the January‚ÄìJune 1829 issue of Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine, headed Noctes Ambrocian√¶. No. XL1V, there is a conversation between a group of fictional characters: > NORTH: Many years ‚Äì I was Sultan of Bello for a long period, until dethroned > by an act of the grossest injustice; but I intend to expose the traitorous > conspirators to the indignation of an outraged world. > TICKLER (aside to SHEPHERD.): He's raving. > SHEPHERD (to TICKLER.): Dementit. > ODOHERTY (to both.): Mad as a hatter. Hand me a segar.Original text by > Project Gutenberg. Canadian author Thomas Chandler Haliburton used the phrase twice in his 1835 book The clockmaker; or the sayings and doings of Samuel Slick of Slickville: \\"And with that he turned right round, and sat down to his map and never said another word, lookin' as mad as a hatter the whole blessed time\\" and \\"Father he larfed out like any thing; I thought he would never stop ‚Äì and sister Sall got right up and walked out of the room, as mad as a hatter.

The series debuted in Japan on January 30, 2003, with Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, later re-released as Disgaea: Afternoon of Darkness and Disgaea DS. One of Nippon Ichi's most popular franchises, it has branched off into both a manga and anime series. The Disgaea games are known for complex gameplay, extremely high maximum stats and humorous dialogue. The main characters are generally cynical, power-hungry antiheroes forced to fight alongside heroic foils. The Disgaea series has sold 4.5 million games as of September 24, 2020.https://nippon1.co.jp/news/pdf/2017/20170518_2.pdf Common elements Gameplay Each Disgaea game consists of a number of missions that the player undertakes from a central hub. In the hub, the player can manage equipment and team members, heal their party, and other functions. When the player is prepared, they can then travel to the next available mission as well as replay any mission they have already completed. Missions are usually arranged in a number of chapters with cutscenes before and after to advance the plot. Each mission requires the player to complete an objective, all missions can be completed by defeating all the enemy forces. The mission takes place on an isometric grid-based board with spaces at various heights. The player and the computer alternate turns. During the player's turn, they can summon members of their party from a starting point, up to ten. Each character, once on the board, can move and then perform an action, including melee attacks and special abilities. Once a character has performed an action, they may no longer move that turn unless they attack before moving. The player can move as many characters as desired and plan their actions at a time, then issuing an \\"Execute\\" command to carry out those actions. If the player has characters that can still move and perform actions at this time, they can do so, otherwise, they will end their turn. The computer opponents then perform their actions. When the player successfully completes a mission, they are given bonus items based on their overall bonus score, which is earned through combo attacks, special attacks, and other features of the game. The player can arrange to have allies next to each other to fight a foe with a chance to launch a combo attack, which can do more damage and boost the mission's scoring meter. Players can also have characters lift and throw other characters or objects on the level for various effects: for example, a character can throw another character to an empty space as to allow that second character to move farther than if on foot, or certain monsters called Prinnies can be thrown at others to cause explosive damage. It is possible for characters to pick up a character that is already carrying another character, and so forth, allowing for one character to move within a single turn to the far side of the map. However, any character that is still carrying another character at the end of the turn will take damage. While a character is holding others they can attack, when this is done each character adds to the damage. Across some boards are glowing colored spaces which are either red, green, blue, yellow, purple, cyan, and special objects called \\"Geo Symbols\\" which are either null, red, green, blue, yellow, purple. When these are placed on a colored field, they impart a bonus or penalty to all battle participants on the same colored field; such bonuses can also stack if multiple Geo Symbols are on the same field. A character can destroy a Geo Symbol which will cause all the field spaces it affects to cause some damage to the characters on them as they turn to another color determined by the destroyed Geo Symbol. It is possible to arrange a chain of these effects, each chain increasing the amount of damaged earned and increasing the bonus score for the mission. As with characters, Geo Symbols can also be lifted and thrown as to affect the board's bonuses. In addition to maintaining their party at the central hub, the player can create new characters to the party based on experience each character earned in battle, or, with enough experience, attempt to alter the features of the central hub, such as having better weapon or armor at the stores. This itself involves convincing the Dark Assembly to agree to such changes, and it is possible to initiate combat in the same manner as the missions to convince the creature to see otherwise. There is also an Item World gateway; here, the player can select any item in the party's inventory and enter it. The Item World for an item is randomly generated but depends on a number of factors based on the item itself such as its rarity or power. By descending through the Item World, each level similar to one of the main missions featuring a random map and a number of creatures as well as an exit portal to the next level, the player can improve the abilities of the item as well as free Guardians that live in the item. These Guardians impart certain benefits to the item, such as increased in attack or defense values, and once they are freed, they can be moved between items freely. The game can be played through multiple times, as each game features multiple endings. However, each time, the player's party, with all characters, items, and abilities, are carried over. This New Game Plus allows the player to develop extremely powerful characters, approaching the maximum character level of 9999 and 186,000 combined levels in reincarnation through repeated playthroughs. The series exists for the moment only in Japanese, English and French languages. Setting All Disgaea games take place mostly in the \\"Netherworld\\", a parallel universe inhabited by demons where moral values are reversed from those of humans. Multiple Netherworlds exist, each with their own Overlord. Other areas include the human world, shown to possess a futuristic level of technology in Hour of Darkness, and \\"Celestia\\", a heavenly realm inhabited by angels. Rather than being purely good or purely evil, inhabitants of the Netherworld and Celestia possess human-like qualities, but are swayed far more towards either moral extreme. It is shown in Disgaea 4 that both the Netherworld and Celestia are dependent on energy from the human world for survival, and that if humans begin to fear themselves, more than they would fear demons and monsters, the Netherworld will fall apart. Recurring characters Most major characters from previous games make a cameo appearance, or lend their services to characters in later ones. The main characters of the first Disgaea game Laharl, Etna and Flonne are playable in every subsequent main title so far. Due to the large number of different Netherworlds being magically connected. Characters from other Nippon Ichi games and series, such as La Pucelle: Tactics, Marl Kingdom, Makai Kingdom, Phantom Brave, Soul Nomad, Z.H.P. Unlosing Ranger VS Darkdeath Evilman, The Witch and the Hundred Knight, Battle Princess of Arcadias and The Guided Fate Paradox have also appeared in Disgaea games. Baal, the most powerful enemy in the Disgaea series, is a legendary overlord that appears as a recurring boss throughout the different games. Known as the Lord of Terror, he is a collection of evil souls that can transfer into other bodies when defeated. He often appears in a towering, monstrous form, though he is forced into more diminutive ones after being defeated. The Prism Rangers are a troupe of gag characters heavily inspired by the protagonists of the Super Sentai/Power Rangers universes. Each of the members are named after the colors of the rainbow with the word Prism preceding it, with their leader being \\"Prism Red\\". The Prism Rangers tend to be portrayed as weak, having been taken down in one shot or being unable to do the slightest bit of damage to their opponent. Asagi is a character meant to be the main character in a development hell Nippon Ichi title, Makai Wars. She constantly attempts to become the star of other games. She is voiced by different voice actresses in different games, each of whom also voices at least one other character in the respective game (Mamiko Noto in Makai Kingdom, Kana Ueda in Disgaea 2, Maria Yamamoto in Soul Nomad, Chiwa Sait≈ç in Disgaea 3, and Kaori Mizuhashi in Prinny: Can I Really Be the Hero?). is a mascot character for the artist and character designer of the series, Takehito Harada. She makes various appearances throughout the series. She is typically portrayed as a petite, blue-haired girl with red eyes, wearing a red ribbon, a white dress, white stockings, and sometimes glasses. She is also known for being mute, with characters at times referencing her refusal (or perhaps inability) to speak; This can be used to comical effect such as when she is a co-anchor, despite herself, for a Netherworld news show that plays between chapters in Disgaea 2. She is often accompanied by a stuffed rabbit named \\"Usagi-san\\" and a stuffed shark named \\"Same-san\\". Prinnies Prinny are common servants, and one of the protagonists as well as enemies in the series. They resemble small pouch- wearing penguins with disproportionately small bat wings and two peg legs for feet. Their personalities are upbeat, and they are required to use the word \\"dood\\" at the end of their sentences to signify their status (\\"-ssu\\" in the Japanese dialogue). While Prinnies use machetes as their primary weapons, they are also able to use \\"Prinny Bombs\\" from their pouch and fire a laser called the \\"Pringer Beam\\". They are created when a human who has led a worthless life or committed a mortal sin in life dies, leading to the soul being sewn into the body of a Prinny. After being reborn, they serve as maids and domestic servants in Celestia, where their good deeds lead to their reincarnation, or as servants and slaves (and sometimes cannon fodder) in the Netherworld, where they obtain money towards their reincarnation, often under lords who treat them horribly for little pay. Prinnies explode when thrown due to the human soul being unstable, and thus, a jostling, such as being tossed, will cause them to do as such.Takehito, Harada (2008), World of Disgaea, Volume 2. Broccoli Books. p. 100. Prinnies are also mass-produced with demon souls, which leaves them stable. During a certain time of the year a red moon appears in the sky of the Underworld; when this happens, all the Prinnies meet together and Prinnies who have earned enough money are allowed to reincarnate. Media Games The first two Disgaea installments were released for the PlayStation 2. The series debuted in Japan with Disgaea: Hour of Darkness in 2003 on the PlayStation 2 and has since been re-released on the PlayStation Portable as Disgaea: Afternoon of Darkness, Nintendo DS as Disgaea DS and the PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch as Disgaea 1 complete with new content. It was known for many uncommon elements previously unseen in the strategy RPG genre, such as complex gameplay, extremely high maximum stats and a maximum level of 9999, and humorous dialogue. Disgaea 2: Cursed Memories, released for the PlayStation 2 in 2006 in Japan, has been re-released on the PlayStation Portable under the title Disgaea 2: Dark Hero Days with new content. Both of these games were later ported to the PC as Disgaea PC in 2016, and Disgaea 2 PC in 2017 respectively. Both are based on the PlayStation Portable versions, with additional content and redone graphics. The series then moved on to the PlayStation 3 for Disgaea 3: Absence of Justice, released in Japan in 2008, and was re-released on the PlayStation Vita as Disgaea 3: Absence of Detention in 2012. Disgaea 4: A Promise Unforgotten was released in Japan in 2011 and re-released on the PlayStation Vita as Disgaea 4: A Promise Revisited in 2014. A direct sequel to the first game, Disgaea D2: A Brighter Darkness was released for the PlayStation 3 in 2013. Disgaea 5: Alliance of Vengeance was released in 2015, moving the series to the PlayStation 4, and was ported to the Nintendo Switch as Disgaea 5 Complete in 2017. The next game, Disgaea 6: Defiance of Destiny, was announced on September 17, 2020 and is coming to both the PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch and most notably, 3D models are now used for the characters, which is a first in the series and the standard maximum level of 9999 increased to 99,999,999. Re-released Disgaea titles have the tradition of featuring an alternate story-line to freshen up gameplay. In the first two re-releases, Etna Mode in Disgaea: Afternoon of Darkness and Axel Mode in Disgaea 2: Dark Hero Days, feature alternate story-lines with new main characters. Disgaea has also spawned several spin-off titles. The first such spin-off, Mugen Keitai Disgaea was released in 2004 as a Japanese mobile game. Makai Kingdom: Chronicles of the Sacred Tome in 2005, released on the PlayStation 2, starred Lord Zetta as an overlord of an alternate Netherworld with gameplay similar to the original Disgaea series. The much-maligned Prinnies were then featured in the side-scrolling adventure game, Prinny: Can I Really Be the Hero? in 2008 and Prinny 2: Dawn of Operation Panties, Dood! in 2010, for the PlayStation Portable. The first Android-based game, Disgaea: Netherworld Unbound, was released in 2011 as a free-to-play game with optional paid-content available. The PlayStation Portable title, Disgaea Infinite, is a visual novel in the same setting as Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, and the story- line of a Prinny being ordered to investigate the attempted assassination of Laharl. Gameplay is very simple compared to other Disgaea titles, with the primary interactive element being the ability to switch characters in order to solve a mystery. Anime Makai Senki Disgaea is an anime series based on the video game Disgaea: Hour of Darkness. Makai Senki Disgaea follows the same general plot as the game, but with several alterations to character roles and the chronology of events. Manga While not necessarily canon, a Disgaea manga, Makai Senki Disgaea, illustrated by Arashi Shindo, follows the basic storyline. Many events in the manga, while similar, have been altered completely and the humor is more offbeat (e.g. Laharl, Etna, and Flonne believe that Mid Boss may be a pedophile due to his recurring presence among the three). Many characters also appear to have different personalities (e.g. on occasion, Lamington will be seen baking a cake). The art style is also very different as many of the characters appear somewhat more mature and the art is very sh≈çjo-like. Broccoli Books released the manga in September 2006. Makai Senki Disgaea 2 ran from 2006‚Äì07 in Japan, and Makai Senki Disgaea 3: School of Devils has been ongoing in Japan since 2009.

Retrieved on 2008-12-17 Novels A set of novels written by Sow Kanimiso and illustrated by Chou Niku (although they were aided by Takehito Harada in the beginning). These novels begin with a novelization of the first game and then continues the story ten years later. The novels introduce many new characters including Laharl's relatives, Flonne's family, and Gordon and Jennifer's daughter. While it is unknown if the novels are considered canon, it can fit alongside Disgaea and Disgaea 2 in the canon due to the placement of the novel's plot (Disgaea 2 takes place only three years after the game, whereas the Disgaea novels are placed ten years after the first game). Currently, there are six novels: Enter the Maoh, Revelation, Returned, On Love part 1 and part 2, and Battle of the Maoh (which also feature appearances by Zetta, Pram, Salome, and King Drake from Makai Kingdom). Laharl, Etna, and Flonne also appear in all other Nippon Ichi novels. This includes the Phantom Brave and Makai Kingdom novels. Recently, a novel for Disgaea 2 has been released. Development The gameplay mechanic of throwing characters was developed as a \\"strong and unique\\" aspect of gameplay that would attract players. New gameplay ideas were added to each game until the \\"majority of staffers\\" were \\"not sure\\" whether they were necessary, hence its complexity. Reception The Disgaea series has been received positively by reviewers, particularly praising the amount of content, solid battle system and humor while criticizing the large learning curve and dated graphics. The highest score was received by Disgaea: Afternoon of Darkness for PSP, at a score of 87% at Gamerankings and Metacritic. Disgaea D2: A Brighter Darkness for PlayStation 3 received the lowest average score of the series, at around 74% at Metacritic, with reviewers praising the gameplay but criticizing the story and the lack of multiplayer features that was in its predecessor Disgaea 4: A Promise Unforgotten. Prinnies have been described as some of the most notable characters in the Disgaea series,Staff (September 2003). \\"Two role-playing games offer a passport to strange new worlds\\".

For example, United States Senators have a six-year term, but they are not all elected at the same time. Rather, elections are held every two years for one-third of Senate seats. Staggered elections have the effect of limiting control of a representative body by the body being represented, but can also minimize the impact of cumulative voting.http://www.stroock.com/SiteFiles/Pub341.pdf Many companies use staggered elections as a tool to prevent takeover attempts. Some legislative bodies (most commonly upper houses) use staggered elections, as do some public bodies, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission. Application in business A staggered board of directors or classified board is a prominent practice in US corporate law governing the board of directors of a company, corporation, or other organization, in which only a fraction (often one third) of the members of the board of directors is elected each time instead of en masse (where all directors have one-year terms). Each group of directors falls within a specified \\"class\\"‚Äîe.g., Class I, Class II, etc.‚Äîhence the use of the term \\"classified\\" board.See Faleye,O., 2007, Classified Boards, Firm value, and Managerial Entrenchment, Journal of Financial Economics83, 501-529. In publicly held companies, staggered boards have the effect of making hostile takeover attempts more difficult. When a board is staggered, hostile bidders must win more than one proxy fight at successive shareholder meetings in order to exercise control of the target firm. Particularly in combination with a poison pill, a staggered board that cannot be dismantled or evaded is one of the most potent takeover defenses available to U.S. companies.See Lucian Bebchuk, John C. Coates IV, and Guhan Subramanian, The Powerful Antitakeover Force of Staggered Boards: Theory, Evidence, and Policy, 54 Stan. L. Rev. 887 (2002). In corporate cumulative voting systems, staggering has two basic effects: it makes it more difficult for a minority group to get directors elected, as the fewer directorships up for election requires a larger percent of the equity to win; and it makes takeover attempts less likely to succeed as it is harder to vote in a majority of new directors. Staggering may also however serve a more beneficial purpose, that is provide \\"institutional memory\\" ‚Äî continuity in the board of directors ‚Äî which may be significant for corporations with long-range projects and plans. Institutional shareholders are increasingly calling for an end to staggered boards of directors‚Äîalso called \\"declassifying\\" the boards. The Wall Street Journal reported in January 2007 that 2006 marked a key switch in the trend toward declassification or annual votes on all directors: more than half (55%) of the S&P; 500 companies have declassified boards, compared with 47% in 2005.Jared A.

They also deliver a wide range of public engagement and archaeological outreach events and activities. The four trusts comprise: *Clwyd-Powys Archaeological Trust *Dyfed Archaeological Trust *Glamorgan-Gwent Archaeological Trust *Gwynedd Archaeological Trust The Welsh HERs were made statutory by the Historic Environment (Wales) Act 2016. This placed an obligation on Welsh Ministers to maintain the HERs, and this duty is discharged by the four Welsh Archaeological Trusts. Cadw overview of the legislative framework On 1 July 2010 the four Welsh Trusts launched their online searchable HER website known as Archwilio, at the Treftadaeth Conference in Swansea. The site was launched by Alun Ffred Jones AM, Minister for Heritage, who observed ‚ÄúWales is the first country in Britain that has made all its archaeological records available online‚Äù, and ‚ÄúArchwilio will be a tremendous asset not only for the people of Wales but also for those further afield who have an interest in the rich archaeology and cultural heritage of our country‚Äù.The Welsh Trusts launch Archwilio The site contains the combined record of the four Trusts and gives the public free access to over 100,000 pieces of information about historic sites across Wales.

Its objective is ‚Äòto advance the education of the public in archaeology‚Äô. CPAT is one of four Welsh Archaeological Trusts (WATs) which work to help protect, record and interpret all aspects of the historic environment. This includes providing advice to local authorities on archaeology and planning, undertaking archaeological projects for private- and public-sector clients, and delivering a programme of community archaeology events and activities. History CPAT was established in 1975 along with three other Welsh Archaeological Trusts. It emerged from the ‚ÄòRescue Archaeology Group‚Äô (RAG) which was set up in 1970 by Chris Musson, who became the first Chief Executive of CPAT. The Trust undertook pioneering work on prehistoric sites in mid-Wales, beginning with the excavation of the Breidden hillfort (Powys) which was being destroyed by quarrying. This was followed by the excavation of a late Iron Age hillslope enclosure at Collfryn (Powys), which found evidence for intensive occupation and remodelling of the site, including round-houses and ‚Äòfour-poster‚Äô structures that were probably granaries. CPAT has also undertaken extensive excavations of medieval sites such as Offa's Dyke and Hen Domen, near Montgomery. CPAT and the other Welsh Archaeological Trusts were pioneers in developing Historic Environment Records (HERs). In the 1970s Wales was the first part of the UK to develop a fully national system of what were then called ‚ÄòSites and Monuments Records‚Äô; this fully computerised system was pioneered by Don Benson who was then Chief Executive of the Dyfed Archaeological Trust. During the 1980s there had been good support from government for archaeology, including from Cadw which had been established in 1984. However, with the decline of the Manpower Services Commission funding models began to shift to a more ‚Äòdevelopment driven‚Äô model during this period. . With the rise of planning-related archaeology in the 1990s CPAT evolved to develop commercial ‚Äòcontract‚Äô archaeology services, whilst at the same time maintaining the HER, planning services and other public-facing project work. Operation and organisation Along with the other Welsh Archaeological Trusts CPAT forms part of a ‚Äòtripod‚Äô of institutions which help understand, conserve and interpret archaeology and cultural heritage in Wales. The Trust system in Wales is characterised by depth of regional knowledge and expertise, which partly comes from having many different roles in one organisation. The Clwyd-Powys Archaeological Trust is organised into three principal departments. The Historic Environment Advisory Service does work that in other parts of the UK are delivered by local authorities or by state heritage bodies. The three key areas of operation are: maintaining the regional Historic Environment Record (HER); providing planning advice for local authorities, developers and other bodies; and undertaking heritage management work for Welsh Government, local authorities, landowners, and others. The Education and Outreach team run a series of events and activities for the general public, providing education about the archaeological history of the region, and also giving an insight into the work of archaeologists. Some of this work is targeted at areas of social and economic exclusion, including recent work in north-east Wales. The Field Services team are responsible for the delivery of archaeological projects funded by private- and public-sector bodies. These include historic environment characterisation, site assessment surveys, field evaluation and excavation, and threat-related excavation and survey. CPAT is a Registered Organisation with the Chartered Institute for Archaeologists. CPAT is both a limited company (1212455) and a registered charity (508301). It therefore provides publicly-accessible accounts to Companies House and to the Charity Commission in the UK. The governing body is the Board of Trustees, who are voluntary non-executive directors. The Trustees delegate their authority for the day-to-day running of the Trust to the Director (Chief Executive).CPAT Trustees Annual Report 2018-19 The current Director, Paul Belford, was appointed in 2013. Beacon Ring Since 2008 the Trust has owned Beacon Ring, a hillfort on the Long Mountain near Welshpool. The site was purchased to help safeguard the earthworks for the future. In recent years CPAT has undertaken some archaeological excavations on the site.

The station was one of several unlicensed radio stations operating in the San Francisco Bay Area. Station founder Daniel \\"Monkey\\" Roberts (who claims to have later legally changed his name to his on-air persona, Monkey), says that he started broadcasting Pirate Cat Radio out of his bedroom in Los Gatos, California (a suburb in the San Francisco Bay Area) at the age of 15, despite receiving hundreds of \\"Notices of Unlicensed Radio Operation\\" from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Roberts claimed on multiple occasions that the station was able to stay on the air based on a clause in FCC regulations that allows a licensing exemption in times of war. However, the FCC rewrote the wartime clause rules following a case in April 2008. By 2005, Roberts claimed that he had been sent 160 warning letters from the FCC, and that he wasn't bothered by the possibility of his signal interfering with other broadcasters. He continued to ignore FCC letters, and reasoned that although his transmitting equipment could be seized, it wouldn‚Äôt be likely to be prosecuted for broadcasting illegally. Plans were made to form a pirate television station similar to Berkeley pirate radio legend Stephen Dunifer‚Äôs low-cost experimental setup, but ultimately all that was broadcast were a catalog of DivX .avi files on a homebrew server, though the station was actively soliciting more content at that time. In a radio interview with Skidmark Bob on Free Radio Santa Cruz in May 2005, Roberts discusses obtaining and rebroadcasting copies of BBC‚Äôs Doctor Who series before being available in the United States. Roberts called on listeners to ‚Äúset up your own station and start playing whatever you want on TV ‚Ä¶ Now is the time, get on it.‚Äù Roberts claimed that the online stream could hold up to 800 people, and planned for Pirate Cat Radio to reach 1000 watts using a directional Yagi-Uda antenna he had built. Pirate Cat radio rebroadcast The Howard Stern Show in 2006 in its uncensored form from Sirius Satellite Radio in the Los Angeles area without permission, although the signal was inconsistent. Howard Stern himself expressed frustration that his subscription-based show was being spread for free, pleading with his audience to ‚Äújust pay the 42 cents a day‚Äù for the Sirus service to access his content. The FCC had previously in 2004 cited Stern‚Äôs show on Clear Channel for ‚Äúrepeated graphic and explicit sexual descriptions,‚Äù prior to moving to Sirus satellite radio. Listeners to the illegal rebroadcasts did claim to have heard profane content on 88.3 Fm in Los Angeles A physical location and caf√© were opened in January 2008 for DJs and live audiences in the Mission District, San Francisco, built out by the staff. In March 2009, Anthony Bourdain brought his show No Reservations to San Francisco and visited Pirate Cat Radio to try the Bacon Maple Latte, a unique creation of baristas of the Pirate Cat Radio Cafe. An account of his visit aired on the Travel Channel in early August 2009. That same month, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors recognized Pirate Cat Radio for the station's \\"...trailblazing efforts towards freeing the airwaves from corporate control, providing the community with training in radio broadcast skills, empowering voices ignored by traditional media outlets; and contributing to the advancement of the City's coffee culture...\\". In May 2010, some of Pirate Cat Radio's programming was edited for content and rebroadcast on licensed station KPDO 89.3. After years of hundreds of warnings, in April 2009 Federal Communications Commission regulators discovered one of the Pirate Cat Radio transmitters on a rooftop in Twin Peaks, broadcasting the station at a frequency higher than the legal limit. The FCC fined Roberts $10,000, forcing the station off the air and causing it to transition into an internet-only radio station with podcasts. The fine was issued for broadcasting without a formal license from the FCC. In an interview, Roberts was quoted as saying \\"You know, a fine is bad, but I don‚Äôt want to go to jail. I look very bad in orange.‚Äù Hirsch, Daniel (November 20, 2009). Pirate Cat Radio fights the feds SFGate.comKumeh, Titania (January 18, 2010). \\"Music Monday: Pirate Cat Radio vs. the FCC\\". MotherJones.com By the end of 2010, many DJs expressed that there had been ongoing concerns about the management of the station over a period of months. In November 2010, DJs were told that 80% of Pirate Cat Radio Cafe had been sold to an outside investor to whom they were to pay their monthly station dues. The following month, Roberts told DJs to no longer pay the investor, but to instead deposit money into a different account. Due to these concerns, DJs asked for more transparency from Roberts, with one DJ Pirata Margarita asking to see a budget. She and other DJs claimed that Roberts terminated her position at the station after this, though he later denied this was the reason. In early February 2011, Roberts left the country, shutting down the stream and website while denying requests for interviews. The volunteer DJ and caf√© staff quickly reorganized as the PCR Collective, focusing on a ‚Äúconsensus-based media organization,‚Äù in contrast to the ‚Äúalmost fascist‚Äù management style that one DJ attributed to Roberts. On June 1, 2011, they began operating in the same location under the name Mutiny Radio.

Born in Belfast, Briggs was scouted by Manchester United at the age of 15, and signed professional forms with them on his 17th birthday. His first team debut came 10 months later, in a First Division match away to Leicester City on 21 January 1961. However, his debut was a disaster; he conceded six goals as United lost 6‚Äì1. Briggs would go on to make a total of 11 appearances for the club, the last coming in 1962, before he was sold to Swansea Town in 1964. A year later, he was signed by Bristol Rovers, where he stayed until 1968, when he moved to Frome Town, thus ending his League football career. Briggs also collected two caps for Northern Ireland, making his debut in a 4‚Äì0 loss to Wales in April 1962. His only other appearance was a 2‚Äì1 win over the Netherlands in 1965. After retiring from football, Briggs went to live in Stapleton, Bristol, and worked in insurance, construction and security until a diagnosis of inoperable lung cancer in December 2007 forced his retirement in March 2008. Briggs died at St. Peter's Hospice, Bristol, on 28 August 2008, and is survived by his wife, Ena, his three children, Julie, Stephen and Jane, seven grandchildren and one great-grandchild.

The main features are: * Data transfer (matrices and data frames) between R and Excel in both directions * Running R code directly from Excel ranges * Writing macros calling R to perform calculations without exposing R to the user * Calling R functions directly from cell formulas, using Excel's autoupdate mechanism to trigger recalculation by R * Using Excel as a GUI for R, making R functionality accessible through menus and dialog boxes instead of a command line oriented programming style. Using this paradigm, the widely used GUI package R Commander is available as an Excel menu bar. * Installed using the package RExcelInstaller from CRAN RExcel works on Microsoft Windows (XP, Vista or 7), with Excel 2003, 2007, 2010, and 2013.

He is considered one of the most important abstract artists in Italy. Life and work In the late 1920s Manlio Rho was deeply involved in Como's engagement with the European abstract movement led by Wassily Kandinsky and Kazimir Malevich. Together with the architects Giuseppe Terragni, Alberto Sartoris, and the painter Mario Radice, he created the astrattisti comaschi, a group of artists that later included Aldo Galli, Carla Prina, and Carla Badiali. This event is widely regarded by critics as a pivotal moment in the history of Italian art of the 20th century. Having worked initially in a figurative manner, he began abstract works in the early 1930s, showing a consistent preference for colour and the harmony of shapes. The art of Rho is marked by a balance between strict geometry, similar to the \\"cold\\" abstractism of Russian suprematism, and a warmth considered typically North Italian. His works comprise flat geometric shapes glowing with lukewarm colours in a palette of greens, browns and orange. In 1940 he signed the futurist manifesto Futuristi Primordiali Antonio Sant'Elia. Shows In 1935 he had his first important exhibition in the Milan art gallery Il Milione. His works have been shown at nine separate Venice Biennale from 1940 to 1986, and in numerous exhibitions around the world. In 2007 some of his works were included in two large exhibitions held in Milan's Royal Palace: Camera con vista and Kandinskji and Italian Abstract Art. Rho's works can be found in the permanent collections of many modern art museums, including Milan, Trento and Rovereto, Trieste and Rome.

Formerly known as the Jewish Historical Society of Greater Washington (JHSGW), the organization adopted a new name in 2018 as it prepared for the opening of its new museum facility, expected in 2021. The organization was founded in 1960 and incorporated as a nonprofit organization in 1965. From 1975 to 2016, it operated the Lillian & Albert Small Jewish Museum in the historic Adas Israel Synagogue building, an 1876 structure that is the oldest surviving synagogue in the city. The synagogue building has been moved three times in its history, with a final move in 2019 to become part of the planned Capital Jewish Museum.  Planned museum  Plans call for the Capital Jewish Museum to be a $34 million, facility located in the Judiciary Square and Capitol Crossing neighborhood of Northwest Washington, D.C. According to the organization, the new four-story building at 3rd and F Streets NW will include three floors of exhibit and programming space. It will incorporate the historic synagogue that formerly housed the museum, with the sanctuary \\"restored to its original appearance.\\" The museum refers to the historic synagogue as the \\"centerpiece\\" and \\"largest artifact\\" of the new museum. Other artifacts in the museum's collection include a lace collar worn by U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg; a notebook used by Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis; photographs of Jewish life in Washington, such as a 1925 image of President Calvin Coolidge dedicating a local Jewish Community Center; a banner carried by Jewish lobbyist Hyman Bookbinder at the 1963 March on Washington; a kippah (yarmulke) from a White House Hanukkah celebration; and items from local Jewish businesses and families, such as a bookstore sign and a wedding cup.  Historic Adas Israel Synagogue  The historic Adas Israel Synagogue was built in 1876 at 6th and G Streets, Northwest to house the Adas Israel Congregation. President of the United States Ulysses S. Grant attended the synagogue's dedication on June 9, 1876, marking the first Jewish service attended by a sitting president. The building is the oldest surviving synagogue building in the District of Columbia.Adas Israel Synagogue being moved in 2017. This was the second time the building has been relocated. Over the following decades, an influx of immigrants from Eastern Europe and Russia swelled the congregation's numbers. The congregation continued to worship in the original synagogue until 1908, when a new building at Sixth and I Streets, NW was dedicated. The congregation later moved again, and the latter building is known today as the Sixth & I Historic Synagogue. The original 1876 building was sold to Stephen Gatti, an Italian-American fruit dealer and real estate investor who lived a block away. In the 1910s, Saint Sophia's Greek Orthodox Church worshiped in the second-floor sanctuary. A succession of churches followed in the 1920s to 1940s. During the course of the next 60 years, the former synagogue's first floor was divided into retail spaces and housed a bicycle shop, barber, Joseph Funger's grocery store, Anthony Litteri's delicatessen, and other businesses. In the 1960s, plans for the construction of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority headquarters at the 6th and G intersection threatened the building with demolition. With the support of federal and city agencies, the Jewish Historical Society of Greater Washington arranged to move the building three city blocks to Third and G Streets, NW. On September 1, 1969, President Richard Nixon signed a law authorizing the District of Columbia government to purchase the building and lease it to the Society for historic preservation purposes at $1 a year for 99 years. The historic synagogue building was restored by the Jewish Historical Society of Greater Washington and became the home of the Lillian & Albert Small Jewish Museum starting in 1975. The historic synagogue building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites, and Historic American Buildings Survey. It is among the oldest synagogue buildings still standing in the United States. 2019 article update. It is also an official project of the Save America's Treasures program.  Relocation to Capital Jewish Museum site (2016-2021)  Starting in 2016, the development of the Capitol Crossing project required the building to move again, as the District of Columbia government sold the land on which it sat. In response, the museum was closed so that the building could be moved to a new permanent home, where it would re-open as part of a new museum building that would be constructed around the historic synagogue. The move proceeded in two stages. First, the structure was first moved about 50 feet to a temporary location on Third Street NW, to await the construction of a parking garage that would serve as its permanent base. Then, in early 2019, the building was moved to its final stop at the corner of Third and F Streets, NW. Local elected officials attended the move and gave speeches, and a rabbi offered a traveler's prayer. At the new location, the synagogue will face east, in accordance with Jewish custom. It will be part of the Capital Jewish Museum to be opened to the public in 2021.

Information Exchange (RiskIE)http://allianceforrisk.org/RiskIE/RiskIE_FAQ.htm is an Internet database created in 2007 by Toxicology Excellence for Risk Assessment (TERA). The database provides in-progress and recently completed chemical risk assessments, and is open for anyone to upload relevant information. By allowing for user input of projects, RiskIE is perhaps the first chemical risk database open for global participation. As a potential global tracking system, RiskIE might enable scientists to keep abreast of current chemical evaluations, identify opportunities for collaborations, and decide how to efficiently proceed with chemical registration, such as that of the European Union's Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH). According to Wullenweber et al. (2008), whereas risk databases have historically managed the risk data of a single country/organization (with some exceptions, e.g., Risk Assessment Information System (RAIS), International Toxicity Estimates for Risk (ITER), Toxipedia), RiskIE offers a centralized database open to all. Michael Dourson and Toxicology Excellence for Risk Assessment (TERA) Prior to starting the nonprofit corporation TERA in 1995, Dourson worked for fifteen years as a toxicologist with the United States Environmental Protection Agency. After 21 years as an independent organization, TERA then merged with the University of Cincinnati, College of Medicine, where it continued its mission to protect public health.. However, after two years the University and TERA decided to separate with independent, but related, missions. Michael now serves as TERA's Director of Science. The International Toxicity Estimates for Risk (ITER) Database According to Wullenweber in 2008, TERA provides an online database International Toxicity Estimates for Risk (ITER) database, which \\"provides chronic human health risk assessment data from a variety of organizations worldwide in a side-by-side format, explains differences in risk values derived by different organizations, and links directly to each organization's website for more detailed information. It is also the only database that includes risk information from independent parties whose risk values have undergone independent peer review.\\" ITER and RiskIE are also resources that support the mission of the Alliance for Risk Assessment (ARA) by tracking up-to-date information on risk assessment activities and risk assessment values.\\"Collaboration and Communication of Global Risk Assessment Information. Wullenweber A, Kroner O, Patterson J*, Wexler P, Rak A, Tomljanovic C; Toxicology Excellence for Risk Assessment; National Library of Medicine; Noblis, Inc.; Concurrent Technologies Corporation. 2nd World Congress on Risk. Guadalajara, Mexico. http://birenheide.com/sra/2008AM/program/singlesession.php3?sessid=W4-C Alliance for Risk Assessment (ARA) The Alliance for Risk Assessment (ARA)‚Äîis a collaboration of many different organizations working on one or more projects of mutual interest. Projects are open to all interested parties. ARA is led by a steering group of scientists from government, university and environmental science NGO. ARA fosters collaborations among stakeholders to leverage limited resources. Databases such as ITER and RiskIE bridge the communication gap between government, industry, academic, and environmental stakeholders.Risk Related Databases and other Resources from the US National Library of Medicine (NLM). Wexler P*; National Library of Medicina. 2nd World Congress on Risk. Guadalajara, Mexico. http://birenheide.com/sra/2008AM/program/singlesession.php3?sessid=W4-C For example, ARA hosts panel discussions with scientists from government, industries, nonprofits and universities on specific chemicals or risk assessment issues. Funding According to a joint investigation by InsideClimate News and the Center for Public Integrity TERA's risk-assessment database \\"receives financial and in-kind support from many companies and government agencies.\\" A review of TERA's website shows that funding is approximately 2/3s government and other nonprofit and approximately 1/3 industry and industry related. TERA has conducted over 100 peer-review meetings with approximately 50 percent of the peer-review panels for studies funded by industry groups; risk values that were accepted in, or changed because of, peer review are included in ITER.. Risk assessment methods or issues that were peer reviewed are described in separate reports. Highlights of these reviews include risk assessment documents associated with the World Trade Center 2001 disaster and the West Virginia MCHM spill of 2014. TERA has close ties to it sponsors which include government, industries, nonprofits and universities. TERA encourages collaborative work whenever possible.

They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine starts as a narrow corridor in which the larva hibernates. In March, it vacates the mine and moves to a new leaf where it creates a transparent, full depth mine that descends from the leaf tip, and occupies the entire width of the blade. Most frass is deposited in the oldest upper part of the mine. The larva may again vacate the mine and restart elsewhere. Larvae can be found from late summer to early May. They are grey green with a pale brown head.

A convict sentenced to the penal colony on Norfolk Island, he escaped and made his way to Nauru in 1842. There he \\"assimilated native culture [...,] took a Nauruan wife, fathered several children, and was adopted as a Nauruan. He became perhaps the only beachcomber the Nauruans ever fully accepted and trusted.\\" He acted as an intermediary between his people of adoption and passing European trade vessels. In 1881, Harris informed the Royal Navy that civil war had broken out on the island. In 1888, when Nauru became a German protectorate, he assisted the German authorities in informing the Nauruans of the way in which the country would be governed, and in persuading them to relinquish their firearms, with which a third of the population had been killed during the civil war. In 1889, his canoe was swept away to sea by strong currents, and he was not seen again.

It was renamed from Cheadle to Cheadle North on 1 July 1950. Operating companies The station was opened on 1 February 1866 by the Stockport, Timperley and Altrincham Junction Railway (ST&AJ;). On 15 August 1867 the ST&AJ; was merged into the Cheshire Lines Committee (CLC) joint railway. The CLC survived intact at the 1923 UK railway grouping and continued to operate the station until the CLC was absorbed into the nationalised British Railways (BR) on 1 January 1948. BR continued to operate the station for a further fourteen years until closure of the station, and others on the line, on 30 November 1964 as part of the Beeching Axe. Location and station facilities The station was located 0.5 miles north of Cheadle at the point where the Manchester Road passes over the line on a bridge. The station was situated on the west side of the bridge, with the main buildings being on the south side of the line - these still survive in non-railway use. There was a small brick-built shelter for passengers on the north side of the line. A goods shed and two-line siding was on the line's south side. The station buildings were converted into a pub in the 1980s. The pub was initially named The Station when it was a Banks Brewery pub and later Chesters Brewery. It is now a free house called The Cheshire Line Tavern. The line through the station (now reduced to single track) remains open for goods traffic. Train services from the station Cheadle CLC station was served by local passenger trains from Stockport Tiviot Dale to Altrincham and to Warrington Central and Liverpool Central stations. The weekday westbound passenger service during July 1922 consisted of four trains to Warrington and Liverpool and four trains to Altrincham. The October 1942 timetable showed the effect of wartime reductions, with three daily weekday passenger trains to Liverpool and one terminating at Glazebrook. In January 1956 the passenger train service remained sparse with just five trains in each direction, with none serving Altrincham.

Highway 97 and the Canadian National Railway (CNR) (formerly BC Rail network) traverse this mountain pass, which is the location of the Bijoux Falls Provincial Park, the Pine Le Moray Provincial Park, and the Powder King Mountain Resort at Azouzetta Lake. Transportation Azouzetta Lake is a scheduled stop for BC Bus North. During the ski season, the PK Express Bus runs Saturday and Sunday from Prince George and Mackenzie. It also runs every Saturday & Sunday from Grande Prairie. History Discovery Informed by First Nations guides, a deserter from the Simon Fraser party crossed the pass in 1806. In attempts from the east in 1873 and west in 1875, surveyors Charles Horetzky and Alfred Richard Cecil Selwyn, respectively, failed to rediscover the pass. Joseph Hunter was successful from the west in 1877, and George Dawson crossed with a pack train of over 90 horses and mules in 1879. Railway The Canadian Pacific Survey during 1879 favoured the Peace Pass or Pine Pass owing to the traffic readily generated by the fertile country, but being too far north, the Canadian Pacific Railway ultimately chose the Kicking Horse Pass. By the 1910s, the CPR was back surveying in the Peace and Pine passes,Fort George Tribune, 7 Jan 1911 leaning toward the latter.Fort George Herald, 14 Jan 1911 The Grand Trunk Pacific Railway charter specified the Peace Pass, Pine Pass or such other Rocky Mountains pass which was most convenient and practicable. After surveying the first two options during 1906‚Äì07, which encompassed of arable land east of the Rockies, the company opted for the \\"bleak sterile\\" country east of the Yellowhead Pass. No doubt motivated by the possibility of securing a \\"branch\\" line to Vancouver later (which proved unsuccessful), this decision hindered the Canadian Northern Railway, whose intention to follow this route was publicly known. Railway companies that aborted proposals to build through the Pine Pass included: the Naas & Peace River Railway,Fort George Tribune, 24 Dec 1910 the Pine Pass Railway,Fort George Herald, 29 Apr 1911 the Pacific & Hudson's Bay Railway,Fort George Tribune, 17 Oct 1914 the Edmonton, Dunvegan & Bella Coola Railway,Fort George Tribune, 16 Nov 1912 and the B.C. & Dawson Railway.Prince George Citizen, 27 Jan 1984 (55) BC Rail excursion, near Pine Pass, 2015. The Pacific Great Eastern Railway (PGE) was expected to route through the Pine Pass,Fort George Herald: 21 Mar 1914 & 4 Apr 1914Prince George Post, 21 Aug 1915 and the Pine Pass Railway might have been a section of this proposal, or a Canadian Northern Railway one. A movement lobbying for a Wapiti Pass routePrince George Citizen, 12 Feb 1919 gained no traction.Prince George Citizen, 2 Apr 1919 When the company surveyed the Peace and Pine passes during 1920, the former's circuitous route through Finlay Forks was a recognized deterrent.Prince George Citizen: 2 Apr 1920 & 6 Aug 1920 When the PGE advance stalled, CPR engineers surveyed the Peace Pass/Finlay Forks route in 1923.Prince George Citizen, 7 Jun 1923 Rumours of a possible CPR takeover of the PGE prompted speculation regarding this route being built to handle ore from the Ferguson group of mines, coal from the Peace River canyon,Prince George Citizen, 28 Sep 1928 and Peace Country wheat.Prince George Citizen, 17 Jan 1929 During 1930, when the Northern Alberta Railways extended westward toward Dawson Creek, the CPR was again surveying routes across the Canadian Rockies. Although Monkman Pass was the shortest distance, a more northerly route better served the agricultural lands and mining prospects of the Peace Country. The greater engineering difficulties of the Pine Pass made Finlay Forks preferable.Prince George Citizen: 25 Sep 1930, 27 Nov 1930, 1 Oct 1931 & 15 Mar 1934 In 1945, the PGE formally filed plans for the Pine Pass route, because it was shorter,Prince George Citizen, 14 Jun 1945 but lobbying for Finlay Forks continued.Prince George Citizen, 14 Aug 1947 When Monkman Pass was later considered, the northern Peace protested.Prince George Citizen, 19 Jan 1953 With the narrow, precipitous, and loose shale conditions ultimately ruling out the Peace Pass, the Pine Pass option became a certainty,Prince George Citizen: 18 Nov 1954 & 29 Sep 1955 but the selection was theoretically left open by tendering the construction only as far north as the Parsnip River.Prince George Citizen, 4 Aug 1955 However, within months, the government let the grading contracts southPrince George Citizen, 31 Oct 1955 and northPrince George Citizen, 8 Dec 1955 of Azouzetta Lake. The Pine Pass decision angered the Peace Pass supporters,Prince George Citizen, 6 Oct 1955 who at least sought a Finlay Forks spur.Prince George Citizen, 23 Apr 1956 On December 13, 1957, the PGE track-laying machine crossed the Pine Pass summit at Mile 126, then waited at Mile 132 for blasting to finish on the approach to an unplanned tunnel.Prince George Citizen: 20 Dec 1957 & 20 Jan 1958 Although the completed sections were already in commercial use , the rails did not reach Dawson Creek until September 1958.Prince George Citizen, 26 Sep 1958 An inaugural run and golden spike ceremony followed a week later.Prince George Citizen: 30 Sep 1958 & 3 Oct 1958 BC Rail excursion, near Pine Pass, 2015. During the 1965/66 winter, a snowdrift derailed the three lead locomotives of a train near the pass.Prince George Citizen, 28 Dec 1965 A crane came up from Squamish to lift the front diesel, and it took two days to reopen the line.Prince George Citizen, 30 Dec 1965 Two months later, an ice buildup on the track derailed two locomotives and a freight car.Prince George Citizen, 7 Feb 1966 In 1967, the PGE carried the 77-ton turbines for the W. A. C. Bennett Dam, which at the time set a record for the highest load in relation to its width transported on the line. The clearance in the Azouzetta Tunnel was .Prince George Citizen, 29 Jun 1967 To minimize snow from clogging the track and stalling locomotives, the 1971 dynamiting at Atunatchi Creek widened the right-of-way. The impact on the Azouzetta Lake environment attracted possibly unfair criticism.Prince George Citizen: 14 & 19 May 1971 When a seven-week strike ended in January, 1975, it took several days to remove the snow and ice buildup in the pass before services resumed.Prince George Citizen: 7, 8 & 10 Jan 1975 In 1982, an avalanche risk delayed the removal of a derailed snow plow, which also left two trains stranded in the area.Prince George Citizen, 13 Jan 1982 During the 1990s, 14 empty tank cars derailed north of Azu village.Prince George Citizen, 13 Jun 1994 A 23-car derailment spilled 2,100 tonnes of sulphur, which the railway sought to bury.Prince George Citizen, 17 Mar 1997 Another 13-car derailment included six liquid natural gas tankers.Prince George Citizen, 3 Aug 1996 A grain-hauling agreement between BC Rail and CNR established equal shipping rates for Peace area grain to Vancouver and Prince Rupert ports.Prince George Citizen, 13 May 1998 Highway A 1923 B.C. Department of Lands map showed a wagon trail through the pass. In 1930, the district provincial engineer intimated the cheaper Pine Pass route, with an estimated $800,000 cost, would be chosen for a highway. An alternate Peace Pass/Finlay Forks route proposed a connection through Manson Creek to the highway under construction from Fort St. James.Prince George Citizen, 7 Aug 1930 The latter, known as the Turgeon Highway continued to receive federal funding as a mining road,Prince George Citizen: 30 Jun 1938 & 15 Jun 1939 but the public support was behind another option, the Monkman Pass.Prince George Citizen: 1 & 18 Mar 1937 The positions of local members of parliament were ambiguous.Prince George Citizen: 2 Dec 1937, 20 Jan 1938, & 8 Dec 1938 In 1943, the Peace, Pine, and Monkman passes were surveyed. The following year, Premier John Hart announced the decision to reconstruct 117 miles of old road and to construct 157 miles of new road over the Pine Pass. Access to agricultural land and mineral deposits determined the final choice.Prince George Citizen, 17 Feb 1944 In 1945, the project was awarded in two sections: Mile 0 (Summit Lake) to Mile 94 (Azouzetta Lake) for $1,823,555 and Mile 94 to Mile 151 for $1,308,940.Prince George Citizen, 28 Jun 1945 The prime contractor for the southwest section, Campbell Construction, experienced extreme unforeseen difficulties,Prince George Citizen, 19 Sep 1946 and abandoned the uncompleted project.Prince George Citizen: 24 Jun 1948 & 5 Aug 1948 After calling new tenders, the lowest bid of $1,446,831 from W. C. Arnett & Co. was accepted.Prince George Citizen: 28 Oct 1948 & 11 Nov 1948 Fred Mannix & Co. completed their northeast section in 1948. Owing to significant changes to the contract with respect to labour- related issues, both Campbell and Mannix sued the province and reached settlements.Prince George Citizen: 10 & 24 Mar 1949 The modest gravel highway was usable by the fall of 1951,Prince George Citizen: 29 Mar 1951 & 16 Aug 1951 but was barely passable during that winter.Prince George Citizen, 15 Nov 1951 The route officially opened the following summer,Prince George Citizen, 3 Jul 1952 but could be challenging even in fine weather.Prince George Citizen, 31 Jul 1952 In the spring of 1955, the section south of the pass to the Parsnip River was approaching impassibility, with three stretches negotiated by Highway Department equipment towing all traffic.Prince George Citizen, 14 Apr 1955 Azouzetta Lake, Pine Pass, 2009. In 1962, work around Mount Le Moray at the northern end of the pass brought the road up to a standard for grading.Prince George Citizen, 19 Apr 1962 Despite promises regarding the imminent paving of the complete Hart Highway,Prince George Citizen: 24 Jul 1959, 17 Oct 1961 & 25 May 1962 it was not until 1963 that a contract was awarded for the pass and its southern approach,Prince George Citizen: 8 & 27 May 1963 and 1964 for the adjoining northern approach.Prince George Citizen, 20 Jul 1964 By 1977, the section comprising the pass summit and southern approaches, previously paved in 1964, was beyond repair. The work to replace the base and repavePrince George Citizen: 25 Apr 1977 & 16 Jun 1977 was completed in 1978.Prince George Citizen, 9 Mar 1978 The adjoining section north to the rail tunnel was rebuilt and repaved in 1985Prince George Citizen, 30 Mar 1985 at a cost of $12 million.Prince George Citizen, 18 Dec 1985 During 1990‚Äì91, three bridges were replaced as part of a widening and straightening project.Prince George Citizen, 30 Jul 1990 Throughout 1994‚Äì96, TNL Paving undertook a $10 million reconstruction of the Bijoux Falls to Azouzetta Lake section, applying a porous three-inch diameter gravel foundation. When the road was previously rebuilt during 1977‚Äì78, the gravel and cement base mixture hindered drainage, which soon caused frost heaves.Prince George Citizen: 25 Jul 1994, 21 Jun 1995, & 2 Nov 1995 During 1997‚Äì98, a section, which adjoined to the southwest, was rebuilt.Prince George Citizen: 10 Jun 1997 & 10 Oct 1997 In 1998, single pass paving was laid north from Azouzetta Lake to Bennett Creek.Prince George Citizen, 22 May 1998 The following year, Peters Bros. Construction repaved a crumbling section to the south of the pass.Prince George Citizen, 14 Jun 1999 Despite this investment, a report by the Northern Development Initiative Trust pressed for a further $135 million worth of improvements.Prince George Citizen, 2 Jan 2010 During 2010‚Äì2011, Cariboo Construction undertook an $18.5 million reconstruction of the remaining section north of Bennett Creek to Link Creek, the only portion untouched over the previous 25 years. Replacing two major bridges over the Pine River and two minor ones over creeks,Prince George Citizen, 10 Nov 2009 the total cost was $40 million.Prince George Citizen: 30 Jul 2010 & 25 Aug 2011 In 2011, a two- day stretch of heavy rain caused washouts at 15 sites. More than 100 workers, and more than 60 pieces of equipment, took nearly two weeks to reopen the highway to single-lane traffic.Prince George Citizen, 7 Jul 2011 Five years later, damage from torrential downpours closed the highway for almost a week.Prince George Citizen: 18, 21 & 24 Jun 2016 Tourism Bijoux Falls, Pine Pass, 2008. Established in 1956, the Bijoux Falls Provincial Park is on the southern approach.

Under a loan default sale in 1977, it comprised lodge accommodation, restaurant and service station.Prince George Citizen: 18 Feb 1977, 7 Apr 1977 & 12 May 1982 Newspaper articles sometimes appear to misname it as the Pine Valley Lodge.Prince George Citizen: 30 Aug 1972, 6 Sep 1972 & 12 May 1982 In the same vein, the Pine Valley Lodge was equally placed at Mile 144.Prince George Citizen: 4, 6, 7 & 9 Jul 1998 It was renamed Azouzetta Lake Lodge, listed for sale in 2002,Prince George Citizen: 27 Apr 2002 & 15 Jun 2002 mothballed in 2012,Prince George Citizen, 21 Jun 2011 and purchased by the Powder King Mountain Resort in 2016. The Pine Le Moray Provincial Park, on the northern approach, was established in 2000.Prince George Citizen, 10 May 2001 Pipelines & High Voltage Lines During 1952, Westcoast Transmission survey crews marked a route through the pass for a natural gas pipeline to the lower mainland.Prince George Citizen: 24 Sep 1951 & 21 Aug 1952 In 1955, the company was granted a two-year extension for completing the $162-million line, and permission to increase the pipeline diameter to .Prince George Citizen, 6 Jun 1955 To construct an oil pipeline through the pass,Prince George Citizen, 18 Apr 1957 pipes were railed there over the recently completed section of the PGE in early 1958.Prince George Citizen, 20 Feb 1958 Western Pacific Products and Crude Oil Pipelines connected Taylor and Kamloops in late 1961.Prince George Citizen: 8 Dec 1961 & 15 Jul 1966 Extending from the W. A. C. Bennett Dam, the 500,000-volt transmission lines through the pass were in place by 1967.Prince George Citizen, 27 Sep 1968 During the 1980s, replacement natural gas pipes were railed to Azu. To facilitate the transmission of higher volumes of gas, the single pipeline was upgraded to narrower pipes laid in dual formation.Prince George Citizen, 15 Sep 1980 With new construction at the ski resort close to the 200-metre-wide transmission corridor, the safety code specified thicker pipes be installed.Prince George Citizen, 4 Sep 1985 Westcoast Energy and the province shared the cost of relocating a section of gas pipelines in 1990. With the 2011 heavy rain and flooding, Pembina temporarily shut down its oil pipeline as a proactive measure before rectifying erosion and assessing the line for damage. Communications, Electricity Connections, & Water/Sewer Infrastructure In the late 1950s, the relay transmitter station for the PGE's new microwave radio system was located at Azouzetta Lake.Prince George Citizen, 30 Sep 1958 Third parties leased channels not required by the railway.Prince George Citizen, 6 Nov 1957 During the late 1980s, the Ministry of Health installed repeater stations in the pass to address reception problems experienced by first responders.Prince George Citizen, 15 Dec 1987 BC Hydro extended the power lines from Honeymoon Creek to connect Azu to the electrical grid. Upfront customer contributions and amortization over a five- year period recovered the $272,000 project cost.Prince George Citizen: 22 Jul 1988, 16 Dec 1988 & 31 May 1989 The regional district approved the installation of a water and sewer system at an amortized cost of $351,440 that was recovered from users over subsequent years.Prince George Citizen, 31 May 1989 School Bus The school bus terminated at Honeymoon Creek, but Pine Pass parents were able to extend the route a further to the Azu community from the 1970/71 school year.Prince George Citizen, 9 Sep 1970 When the school board withdrew the service for the 1972/73 year, because of cost,Prince George Citizen: 30 Aug 1972 & 6 Sep 1972 it affected less than 10 students. Withholding their children from school, an unwillingness to compromise, and lobbying,Prince George Citizen: 21 & 27 Sep 1972; 6, 10, 18 & 30 Oct 1972; 22 Nov 1972; & 6 Dec 1972 parents pressured the province to resume the service,Prince George Citizen: 20 Dec 1972 & 3 Jan 1973 which lapsed when no longer required. When a family of four moved to Azouzetta Lake in 1977, the school board agreed to increase the travel allowance to $7.60 per day to cover the parent's drive to connect with the bus,Prince George Citizen, 2 Feb 1977 however, efforts continued to restore a 100 percent subsidy from the province for a bus service.Prince George Citizen, 13 Sep 1978 For the 1989/90 year, despite nine or 10 children living in the village, the school bus connection further withdrew to the Mackenzie turnoff, away.Prince George Citizen, 2 Sep 1989, 20 Oct 1989, & 18 & 22 Nov 1989 From the 1990/91 year, the bus terminus was restored once more to Azu village (Powder King),Prince George Citizen, 1 Sep 1990 but was returned to the Mackenzie turnoff from the 1997/98 year,Prince George Citizen, 8 Sep 1997 because of low ridership.

The team's main sponsors are TIBCO Software and Silicon Valley Bank. The owner is Linda Jackson, a former professional cyclist. Team history Team TIBCO-Silicon Valley Bank is the longest running women‚Äôs professional cycling team in North America and traces its roots back to the Palo Alto Bicycles Women‚Äôs (PABW) team. The team was created by Stanford MBA and Investment Banker, Linda Jackson. Jackson left Investment banking in the early 90s to pursue her dream of becoming an Olympian. After becoming Canada‚Äôs National Champion in 1995, Jackson was selected to represent Canada in the time trial and road race at the 1996 Atlanta Games. She went on to win the Bronze medal at the 1996 World Championship Road Race in Lugano, Switzerland and accumulated numerous Canadian national championship titles in the road race and time trial. Cycling gave Jackson so much personally, that when she retired from the sport, she knew she wanted to help other women pursue their cycling aspirations. Jackson became involved with PABW on a coaching basis in 2004, directed the team in 2005 and then added TIBCO as a sponsor in 2005 in order to help the team grow from a local racing team to a national-level team. Racing as PABW powered by TIBCO in 2006, the team finished the year ranked 36 th overall in North America, up from 60 th overall the year before. The following year, Jackson added Silicon Valley Bank as a sponsor.

Career College and Amateur Williams played college soccer at Philadelphia University from 2002 to 2005. [1] Junior and senior year saw Williams earn Philadelphia Soccer Seven and Atlantic Soccer Conference 1st team honors. He graduated with a bachelor's degree in business management. During his college years he also played with the Ocean City Barons in the USL Premier Development League during the collegiate off season, playing play with the Barons each summer from 2004 through 2006. Williams was named to the 2004 All-Conference Team while leading the Barons to a rare undefeated regular season (14-0-4). After this undefeated season in 2004, Williams was offered a contract from New England Revolution but declined and decided to finish school. Professional Late summer of 2006, after a season in Ocean City, Chris played with the New York Red Bulls before signing with Miami FC of the USL First Division, playing in 21 games and was 4th on the team in minutes played. The fall of 2007, he was drafted 1st round, 4th overall and eventually signed with the Philadelphia KiXX of Major Indoor Soccer League. He played the 2007-2008 MISL season with the KiXX, then rejoined Miami FC for the 2008 summer season. The winter of 2008 saw Williams go on trial and sign with Danish 2nd Division club Blokhus FC, however the contract was mutually annulled before Williams returned to Denmark. While on trial with Blokhus Williams was identified by 1st division side Thisted FC landing him a trial with the club after his annulled contract. Williams was set to return to Thisted in the summer window of 2009, however due to some financial quagmires at the club he was not brought back. In December 2009, Miami FC welcomed Chris Back to the team. After this season, Williams signed with ƒê√† N·∫µng of the V-League, the top division in Vietnam . In 2009, Da Nang won the League and the cup title landing them in the 2010 AFC Champions league. Upon his return to the United States in 2011 Williams signed for his old PDL club, the Ocean City Nor'easters . He made his debut for his new team on May 28 in a 2-2 tie against the Long Island Rough Riders . After a short spell in Ocean city to keep fit, in late 2011, Williams went back to Vietnam where he was signed by his former team SHB Da Nang, and loaned to Fico T√¢y Ninh FC. In the fall of 2012, Williams signed with the Harrisburg Heat of the Professional Arena Soccer League where he scored 10 goals and 4 assists and was named the team's co-MVP. Williams left Harrisburg with one game left to join the Baltimore Blast of the Major Indoor Soccer League . Baltimore went on to when the 2013 Championship, where Williams assisted on the Championship game-winning goal. While in Baltimore Chris signed with the San Antonio Scorpions of the NASL, which was to begin as soon as his stint in Baltimore was complete (Late March 2013). While in San Antonio Williams played in five consecutive matches, 4 of which he started in. Due to a family emergency Williams parted ways with the Scorpions and was thought to have retired. In June 2013, Williams traveled to Thailand for two months with Club Bangkok United. Upon return to the states Williams, signed for MISL club PA Roar, where he was team captain. Chris was 2nd in the league in blocked shots with 29, as well as 13th in points for a defender despite the teams last place finish (1-19).

The curse of the pharaohs or the mummy's curse is a curse alleged to be cast upon anyone who disturbs the mummy of an ancient Egyptian, especially a pharaoh. This curse, which does not differentiate between thieves and archaeologists, is claimed to cause bad luck, illness, or death. Since the mid-20th century, many authors and documentaries have argued that the curse is 'real' in the sense of having scientifically explicable causes such as bacteria or radiation. However, the modern origins of Egyptian mummy curse tales, their development primarily in European cultures, the shift from magic to science to explain curses, and their changing uses‚Äîfrom condemning disturbance of the dead to entertaining horror film audiences‚Äîsuggest that Egyptian curses are primarily a cultural, not exclusively scientific, phenomenon.The Mummy's Curse: Mummymania in the English-speaking World, Jasmine Day, Routledge, 2006 There are occasional instances of genuine ancient curses appearing inside or on the fa√ßade of a tomb, as in the case of the mastaba of Khentika Ikhekhi of the 6th Dynasty at Saqqara. These appear to be directed towards the ka priests to protect the tomb carefully and preserve its ritual purity rather than as a warning for potential robbers. There had been stories of curses going back to the 19th century, but they multiplied after Howard Carter's discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun. Despite popular misconceptions, no curse was found inscribed in the Pharaoh's tomb.J. Paterson-Andrews, C. Andrews, p. 190. The evidence for curses relating to Tutankhamun is considered to be so meager that Donald B. Redford viewed it as \\"unadulterated claptrap\\".The Boy Behind the Mask, Charlotte Booth (quoting Donald B. Redford), p. xvi, Oneword, 2007,  Tomb curses  Curses relating to tombs are extremely rare, possibly because the idea of such desecration was unthinkable and even dangerous to record in writing. They most frequently occur in private tombs of the Old Kingdom era. Ancient Egypt, David P. Silverman, p. 146, Oxford University Press US, 2003, The tomb of Ankhtifi (9‚Äì10th dynasty) contains the warning: \\"any ruler who... shall do evil or wickedness to this coffin... may Hemen ([a local deity]) not accept any goods he offers, and may his heir not inherit\\". The tomb of Khentika Ikhekhi (9‚Äì10th dynasty) contains an inscription: \\"As for all men who shall enter this my tomb... impure... there will be judgment... an end shall be made for him... I shall seize his neck like a bird... I shall cast the fear of myself into him\\". Curses after the Old Kingdom era are less common though more severe, sometimes invoking the ire of Thoth or the destruction of Sekhemet. Zahi Hawass quotes an example of a curse: \\"Cursed be those who disturb the rest of a Pharaoh. They that shall break the seal of this tomb shall meet death by a disease that no doctor can diagnose.\\" Valley of the Golden Mummies, Zahi A. Hawass, pp. 94‚Äì97, American University Press in Cairo Press, 2000,  Modern accounts  Hieroglyphs were not deciphered until the beginning of the 19th century by Jean-Fran√ßois Champollion, so reports of curses before this are simply perceived bad luck associated with the handling of mummies and other artifacts from tombs. In 1699, Louis Penicher wrote an account in which he recorded how a Polish traveler bought two mummies in Alexandria and embarked on a sea journey with the mummies in the cargo hold. The traveler was alarmed by recurring visions of two specters, and the stormy seas did not abate until the mummies were thrown overboard. Zahi Hawass recalled that as a young archaeologist excavating at Kom Abu Billo he had to transport several artifacts from the Greco-Roman site. His cousin died on that day, his uncle died on its first anniversary, and on the third anniversary, his aunt died. Years later, when he excavated the tombs of the builders of the pyramids at Giza, he encountered the curse: \\"All people who enter this tomb who will make evil against this tomb and destroy it may the crocodile be against them in water, and snakes against them on land. May the hippopotamus be against them in water, the scorpion on land.\\" Though not superstitious, he decided not to disturb the mummies. However, he later was involved in the removal of two child mummies from Bahariya Oasis to a museum and reported he was haunted by the children in his dreams. The phenomena did not stop until the mummy of the father was reunited with the children in the museum. He concluded that mummies should not be displayed, though it was a lesser evil than allowing the general public into the tombs. Hawass also recorded an incident of a sick young boy who loved Ancient Egypt and was subject to a \\"miracle\\" cure in the Egyptian Museum when he looked into the eyes of the mummy of King Ahmose I. The idea of a mummy reviving from the dead, an essential element of many mummy curse tales, was developed in The Mummy!: Or a Tale of the Twenty-Second Century, an early work combining science fiction and horror, written by Jane C. Loudon and published anonymously in 1827. Louisa May Alcott was thought by Dominic Montserrat to have been the first to use a fully formed \\"mummy curse\\" plot in her 1869 story Lost in a Pyramid, or The Mummy's Curse, a hitherto forgotten piece of mummy fiction that he rediscovered in the late 1990s.Consuming Ancient Egypt, Sally MacDonald, Michael Rice, p. 26, University College, London. Institute of Archaeology, Routledge Cavendish, 2003, However, two stories subsequently discovered by S. J. Wolfe, Robert Singerman and Jasmine Day ‚Äì The Mummy‚Äôs Soul (Anonymous, 1862) and After Three Thousand Years (Jane G. Austin, 1868) ‚Äì have similar plots, in which a female mummy takes magical revenge upon her male desecrator. Jasmine Day, therefore, argues that the modern European concept of curses is based upon an analogy between desecration of tombs and rape, interpreting early curse fiction as proto-feminist narratives authored by women. The Anonymous and Austin stories predate Alcott's piece, raising the possibility that even earlier \\"lost\\" mummy curse prototype fiction awaits rediscovery.The Mummy's Curse: Mummymania in the English-speaking World, Jasmine Day, Routledge, 2006, pp. 46‚Äì47, 52‚Äì53  Opening of King Tutankhamun's tomb  Tutankhamun's curse statue of Anubis figure which guarded the entrance to Tutankhamun's treasury room. The belief in a curse was brought to many people's attention due to the deaths of a few members of Howard Carter's team and other prominent visitors to the tomb shortly thereafter. Carter's team opened the tomb of Tutankhamun (KV62) in 1923, launching the modern era of Egyptology. The famous Egyptologist James Henry Breasted worked with Carter soon after the first opening of the tomb. He reported how Carter sent a messenger on an errand to his house. On approaching his home the messenger thought he heard a \\"faint, almost human cry\\". Upon reaching the entrance he saw the birdcage occupied by a cobra, the symbol of the Egyptian monarchy. Carter's canary had died in its mouth and this fueled local rumors of a curse.Winstone, p. 169 Arthur Weigall, a previous Inspector- General of Antiquities to the Egyptian Government, reported that this was interpreted as Carter's house being broken into by the Royal Cobra, the same as that worn on the King's head to strike enemies (see Uraeus), on the very day the King's tomb was being broken into.The Face of Tutankhamun, Christopher Frayling, p. 232, Faber & Faber, 1992, An account of the incident was reported by The New York Times on 22 December 1922.\\"Times Man Views Splendors of the Tomb of Tutankhamen\\", The New York Times, 22 December 1922, Retrieved 12 May 2009 The first of the mysterious deaths was that of Lord Carnarvon. He had been bitten by a mosquito, and later slashed the bite accidentally while shaving. It became infected and that resulted in blood poisoning. Two weeks before Carnarvon died, Marie Corelli wrote an imaginative letter that was published in the New York World magazine, in which she quoted an obscure book that confidently asserted that \\"dire punishment\\" would follow any intrusion into a sealed tomb. A media frenzy followed, with reports that a curse had been found in the King's tomb, though this was untrue. The superstitious Benito Mussolini, who had once accepted an Egyptian mummy as a gift, ordered its immediate removal from the Palazzo Chigi. The death of Lord Carnarvon six weeks after the opening of Tutankhamun's tomb resulted in many curse stories in the press. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, creator of Sherlock Holmes, suggested that Lord Carnarvon's death had been caused by \\"elementals\\" created by Tutankhamun's priests to guard the royal tomb, and this further fueled the media interest.J. Paterson-Andrews, C. Andrews, p. 196 Arthur Weigall reported that six weeks before Carnarvon's death, he had watched the Earl laughing and joking as he entered the King's tomb and said to a nearby reporter (H. V. Morton), \\"I give him six weeks to live.\\"Winstone, p. 262 The first autopsy carried out on the body of Tutankhamun by Dr. Derry found a healed lesion on the left cheek, but as Carnarvon had been buried six months previously it was not possible to determine if the location of the wound on the King corresponded with the fatal mosquito bite on Carnarvon.In the Valley of the Kings ‚Äì Howard Carter and the Mystery of King Tutankhamun's Tomb, Daniel Meyerson, p. 158, Ballantine Books, 2009, A study of documents and scholarly sources led The Lancet to conclude as unlikely that Carnarvon's death had anything to do with Tutankhamun's tomb, refuting another theory that exposure to toxic fungi (mycotoxins) had contributed to his demise. The report points out that the Earl was only one of many to enter the tomb, on several occasions and that none of the others were affected. The cause of Carnarvon's death was reported as \\"'pneumonia supervening on [facial] erysipelas,' (a streptococcal infection of the skin and underlying soft tissue). Pneumonia was thought to be only one of various complications, arising from the progressively invasive infection, that eventually resulted in multiorgan failure.\\"Cox, A. M. \\"The death of Lord Carnarvon\\", by Ann M. Cox; The Lancet; 7 June 2003. [sic] The Earl had been \\"prone to frequent and severe lung infections\\" according to The Lancet and there had been a \\"general belief ... that one acute attack of bronchitis could have killed him. In such a debilitated state, the Earl's immune system was easily overwhelmed by erysipelas.\\" In 1925, the anthropologist Henry Field, accompanied by Breasted, visited the tomb and recalled the kindness and friendliness of Carter. He also reported how a paperweight given to Carter's friend Sir Bruce Ingram was composed of a mummified hand with its wrist adorned with a scarab bracelet marked with, \\"Cursed be he who moves my body. To him shall come fire, water, and pestilence.\\" Soon after receiving the gift, Ingram's house burned down, followed by a flood when it was rebuilt.Winstone, p. 265. Howard Carter was entirely skeptical of such curses,J. Paterson-Andrews, C. Andrews, p. 198. dismissing them as 'tommy-rot' and commenting that \\"the sentiment of the Egyptologist ... is not one of fear, but of respect and awe ... entirely opposed to foolish superstitions\\".Winstone, p. 365. In May 1926 he reported in his diary a sighting of a jackal of the same type as Anubis, the guardian of the dead, for the first time in over thirty-five years of working in the desert, although he did not attribute this to supernatural causes.Winstone, p. 266. Skeptics have pointed out that many others who visited the tomb or helped to discover it lived long and healthy lives. A study showed that of the 58 people who were present when the tomb and sarcophagus were opened, only eight died within a dozen years. All the others were still alive, including Howard Carter, who died of lymphoma in 1939 at the age of 64.David Vernon in Skeptical ‚Äì a Handbook of Pseudoscience and the Paranormal, ed. Donald Laycock, David Vernon, Colin Groves, Simon Brown, Imagecraft, Canberra, 1989, , p. 25. The last survivors included Lady Evelyn Herbert, Lord Carnarvon's daughter who was among the first people to enter the tomb after its discovery in November 1922, who lived for a further 57 years and died in 1980, and American archaeologist J.O. Kinnaman who died in 1961, 39 years after the event.\\"Death Claims Noted Biblical Archaeologist\\", Lodi News-Sentinel, 8 September 1961, Retrieved 9 May 2014 Deaths popularly attributed to Tutankhamun's curse The tomb was opened on 29 November 1922. * George Herbert, 5th Earl of Carnarvon, a financial backer of the excavation team who was present at the tomb's opening, died on 5 April 1923 after a mosquito bite became infected; he died 4 months and 7 days after the opening of the tomb. * George Jay Gould I, a visitor to the tomb, died in the French Riviera on 16 May 1923 after he developed a fever following his visit. * A.

By the late 1940s, the congregation had outgrown the small building in which it met, and, after considering expansion plans, decided to purchase a synagogue building erected in 1908 by the Adas Israel Congregation, now known as the Sixth & I Historic Synagogue.

Moralistic writings Samuel Johnson regarded himself as a moralist during his career between 1748 and 1760. Although Johnson wrote a poem, many essays, and a short novel, all of these works are connected by a common intent and each relates to others. The works during this period cannot be separated without disregarding Johnson's major ideas and themes. As David Greene points out, Johnson's moral writings contain no \\"predetermined and authorized pattern of 'good behavior,'\\" although they do emphasize certain kinds of conduct. To be moral, in Johnson's view, an individual must always be self-aware and self-critical. Johnson respected committed Christians of other denominations than his own High Church Anglicanism. . His aversion to Milton's politics entails no attack Milton's religious beliefs. He defended Thomas Browne by saying, in his Life of Browne: > Men may differ from each other in many religious opinions, and yet all may > retain the essentials of Christianity; men may sometimes eagerly dispute, > and yet not differ much from one another: the rigorous prosecutors of error > should, therefore, enlighten their zeal with knowledge, and temper their > orthodoxy with charity; that charity without which orthodoxy is vain. He attacks other religions or their adherents on the grounds that they betray Christ's teachings. This is not to say that Johnson was passive in his religious observance; instead, he was an 18th-century evangelical, which, as he defines in his Dictionary, means \\"Agreeable to gospel; consonant to the Christian law contained in the holy gospel\\". The Vanity of Human Wishes The Vanity of Human Wishes is a sort of prologue to Johnson's career as a moralist. The Rambler The Idler Rasselas Rasselas is a sort of epilogue to Johnson's career as a moralist. Sermons Johnson's sermons, according to David Greene, are \\"a neglected but important and rewarding section of his writings\\". They are dry and formally organized because Johnson did not approve of the emotionally charged rhetoric of 17th century preachers at the pulpit. Christian religion and ethics are the primary topic of the sermons with emphasis on marriage, repentance, hardening the heart, charity, pride, wisdom, and compassion. Sometimes Johnson discussed theological topics like the nature of God or political topics like morality's role in governmental action. Views Johnson was a rationalist and believed that rational thought was vital to morality. On poverty In his review of Soame Jenyns's A Free Enquiry into the Nature and Origin of Evil and its argument that those \\"born to poverty\\" should not be educated so they could enjoy the \\"opiate of ignorance\\", Johnson wrote, \\"To entail irreversible poverty upon generation after generation only because the ancestor happened to be poor, is, in itself, cruel, if not unjust\\". On madness When Jenyns claimed that madness was a way God ensured that the poor would be content with life, Johnson responded: > On the happiness of madmen, as the case is not very frequent, it is not > necessary to raise a disquisition, but I cannot forbear to observe that I > never yet knew disorders of mind increase felicity; every madman is either > arrogant and irascible, or gloomy and suspicious, or possessed by some > passion or notion destructive to his quiet. He has always discontent in his > look, and malignity in his bosom. And, if we had the power of choice, he > would soon repent who should resign his reason to secure his peace. On education Johnson responds to Jenyns's final argument, that the ends justify the means when it comes to keeping the poor uneducated, by saying: > I am always afraid of determining on the side of envy or cruelty. The > privileges of education may sometimes be improperly bestowed, but I shall > always fear to withhold them lest I should be yielding to the suggestions of > pride, while I persuade myself that I am following the maxims of policy; and > under the appearance of salutary restraints, should be indulging the lust of > dominion, and that malevolence which delights in seeing others depressed. On slavery Johnson's anti-slavery views were so strong that Boswell characterized them in this way: \\"His violent prejudice against our West-Indian and American settlers appeared whenever there was an opportunity.\\" Boswell also notes that at Oxford Johnson gave a toast and said, \\"Here's to the next insurrection of the Negroes in the West Indies\\", in addition to criticizing American independence for its hypocrisy regarding slavery.

Political writings Johnson was known as either a staunch Tory or was thought not to be active within politics; his political writings were subsequently disregarded and neglected. Boswell's Life of Samuel Johnson is to blame for part of this. Boswell did not meet Johnson until later in life, and he was unable to discuss how politics affected Johnson during his early years. Two periods, Robert Walpole's control over British Parliament and the Seven Years' War, were Johnson's most active periods and are the source for much of his early writings. Although Boswell was present with Johnson during the 1770s and describes four major pamphlets written by Johnson, he neglects to discuss them because he is more interested in their travels to Scotland. This is compounded by the fact that Boswell held an opinion contradictory to two of these pamphlets, The False Alarm and Taxation No Tyranny, and so he attacks Johnson's views in his biographyGreene 2000 p. xxi‚Äîincluding Johnson's attacks on slavery. Boswell was not the only reason why Johnson was disregarded as a political thinker; Thomas Babington Macaulay tried to promote the belief that Johnson's political thoughts were nonsensical and were the writings of a bigot.Greene 2000 p. xxii However, Macaulay was also a Whig, and the one who established the philosophical view that Whigs and Tories were polar opposites, a view that Johnson did not hold.Greene 2000 p. xx Johnson's views on politics constantly changed through his life, and early on he admitted to sympathies for the Jacobite cause but, by the reign of George III, he came to accept the Hanoverian Succession. It was Boswell who gave people the impression that Johnson was an \\"arch-conservative\\", and it was Boswell, more than anyone else, who determined how Johnson would be seen by people years later. Minor pamphlets These Pamphlets played a major role, causing growing tension between America and Britain. =False Alarm= In 1770, he produced The False Alarm, a political pamphlet attacking John Wilkes. =Thoughts Respecting Falkland's Islands= In 1771, his Thoughts on the Late Transactions Respecting Falkland's Islands cautioned against war with Spain. =The Patriot= In 1774, he printed The Patriot, a critique of what he viewed as false patriotism. On the evening of 7 April 1775, he made the famous statement, \\"Patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel.\\" This line was not, as is widely believed, about patriotism in general, but the false use of the term \\"patriotism\\" by William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham (the patriot- minister) and his supporters. Johnson opposed \\"self-professed patriots\\" in general, but valued what he considered \\"true\\" self-professed patriotism. =Taxation No Tyranny= Annotated proofs of Johnson's Taxation No Tyranny (1775) The last of these pamphlets, Taxation No Tyranny (1775), was a defence of the Coercive Acts and a response to the Declaration of Rights of the First Continental Congress of America, which protested against taxation without representation. Johnson argued that in immigrating to America, colonists had \\"voluntarily resigned the power of voting\\", but they still had \\"virtual representation\\" in Parliament. In a parody of the Declaration of Rights, Johnson suggested that the Americans had no more right to govern themselves than the Cornish people. If the Americans wanted to participate in Parliament, said Johnson, they could move to England and purchase an estate. Johnson denounced English supporters of America as \\"traitors to this country\\", and hoped that the matter would be settled without bloodshed, but that it would end with \\"English superiority and American obedience\\". Views Johnson was a devout, conservative Anglican and believed in a unity between the High Church and the Crown (the State).Bate Achievement p. 36 Although Johnson respected John Milton's poetry, he could not tolerate Milton's Puritan and Republican beliefs. Colonialism Johnson had advocated that the English and the French were just \\"two robbers\\" who were stealing land from the indigenous people of North America, and that neither deserved to live there. After the signing of the 1783 Peace of Paris treaties, marking the American colonists' defeat of the British, Johnson was \\"deeply disturbed\\" with the \\"state of this kingdom\\". Scotland James Boswell, a Scotsman, was a close companion and friend to Johnson during many important times of his life yet Johnson, like many of his fellow Englishmen, had a reputation for despising Scotland and its people. Even during their journey together through Scotland, Johnson \\"exhibited prejudice and a narrow nationalism\\". Hester Thrale, in summarising Johnson's nationalistic views and his anti-Scottish prejudice, said, \\"We all know how well he loved to abuse the Scotch, & indeed to be abused by them in return\\". On 6 August 1773, eleven years after first meeting Boswell, Johnson set out to visit his friend in Scotland, to begin \\"a journey to the western islands of Scotland\\", as Johnson's 1775 account of their travels would put it. The work was intended to discuss the social problems and struggles that affected the Scottish people, but it also praised many of the unique facets of Scottish society, such as a school in Edinburgh for the deaf and dumb. Slavery He agreed with the Whigs in being an opponent of slavery, unlike most Tories. This was well before the heyday of abolitionism, and he once proposed a toast to the \\"next rebellion of the negroes in the West Indies\\". He had a black manservant, Francis Barber (Frank), whom Johnson made his heir.Boswell Aetat. 75 transcribes Johnson's will Notes References * . * . * . * . * . * . * .

It is mostly white, with ochraceous or brownish cap markings, and a short robust stem. It is edible, but poor in taste, and grows in coniferous, broadleaved, or mixed woods. It can be confused with other white Russula species and certain white Lactarius species. Taxonomy First described by the Swedish mycologist Elias Magnus Fries in 1838, its specific epithet delica is Latin for \\"weaned\\". Older names include Christian Hendrik Persoon's Lactarius piperatus var. exsuccus. This species has undergone many taxonomic changes over the years. Russula chloroides is now considered a distinct species because of the very dense lamellae and blue/green zone at the stem apex of some specimens. Gill spacing, gill depth, spore colour and spore ornamentation have also thrown many finds into doubt, and a number of varieties have been described throughout the years.Sarnari, M. (1998). Monografia Illustrata del Genere Russula in Europa. Vol. 1. A.M.B. Fondazione.Galli, R. (2003). Le Russule 2nd Edition. R. Galli. Mycologist John Burton Cleland collected a form he described in 1935 as R. delica from under eucalypts in the Mount Lofty Ranges in South Australia, however, this was reclassified as a new species R. marangania in 1997 by Cheryl Grgurinovic. Description The basidiocarps (fruiting bodies) of Russula delica seem loath to leave the soil, and are often found half buried, or sometimes growing hypogeously. As a result, the caps often trap the surrounding leaf debris and soil on their rough surfaces. The cap can be in diameter. It is white, usually tinged with ochre or brown, with an inrolled margin, which usually remains white. At first it is convex, but later flattens, and is often funnel shaped. The firm, white stipe is short and stout, measuring 2‚Äì6 cm (0.8‚Äì2.4 in) high and 2‚Äì4 cm (0.8‚Äì1.6 in) wide. The gills are decurrent, and are quite closely spaced initially. The spore print is creamy white, and the warty oval spores measure 8‚Äì12 x 7‚Äì9 Œºm. The flesh is white, and does not change colour on cutting. It has a pleasant, fruity smell when young, but at maturity it may develop a faintly fishy or unpleasant smell.Loizides M, Kyriakou T, Tziakouris A. (2011). Edible & Toxic Fungi of Cyprus (in Greek and English). Published by the authors. pp. 250‚Äì51. . It has a spicy, tangy taste. Similar species Russula chloroides is very similar and often confused with R. delica. It can be separated by the turquoise band at the apex (at the attachment of the gills with the cap) and by its unpleasant, peppery smell. Russula pallidospora is another similar species, which has very tough flesh, more distant gills and an ochraceous spore deposit. Russula flavispora is also similar but rare, and has dense gills and a deep ochraceous spore deposit. Similar whitish milk-cap species, such as Lactifluus piperatus all exude milk from the gills, and the cut flesh. Distribution and habitat Russula delica is widespread in the northern temperate zones, including Europe and Asia. It is particularly common in the Eastern Mediterranean. It is a thermophylic species, appearing during hot spells in summer and autumn in broadleaved and coniferous woods. In North America Russula delica is rare and is largely replaced by R. brevipes, which is very similar, but not found in Europe. Edibility This mushroom is edible but poor, having an unpleasant taste, leading some to classify it as inedible. However, in Cyprus,Loizides, M. (2008). A secret world: The fungi of Cyprus.

History The location was originally a monastery of canonesses regular founded in 1640 by King Louis XIII, named the Priory of Our Lady of Victory of Lepanto, in honor of the Christian victory over Ottoman forces in the Battle of Lepanto in 1571. Its site is in the corner of what is now Boulevard Diderot with Rue de Picpus. In 1792 the monastery was confiscated by the French government and the canonesses were forced to disband. In late 1793 the complex was leased by Eug√®ne Coignard and converted into a 150-bed private prison hospital for those prisoners of the Terror who were able to pay for a more comfortable confinement. The majority of the people held there escaped execution. The most notorious prisoner at the Coignard House was the Marquis de Sade. The former monastery gardens were seized by the city and used to bury the bodies of those executed at a guillotine set up nearby. The site was later purchased by surviving family members of the aristocracy who were buried in the common graves of the site. Today the cemetery is the Picpus Cemetery.

These projects are meant to keep up with the population's rapid growth, which has strained the country's current infrastructure. Roads Doha has a comprehensive road network made up primarily of two and three-lane dual carriageways (divided highways). As a result of Doha being a relatively young city circling a central area, a majority of main streets are inordinately wide highway-like motorways that usually include service roads and large medians. While traditionally roundabouts have been used as intersections in the city, they are being rapidly phased out for signalized intersections as they are proving ineffective at regulating the increased traffic flow in turn overloading the city's road network. Most major roundabouts have been either converted to intersections or interchanges. Highways There are five main highways connecting Doha to its neighboring cities. These are the Dukhan Highway to the west of the city, the Al-Shamal Road, connecting Doha to the north of the country, the Al Khor Coastal Road, connecting Doha to the northern town of Al Khor, and the Al Wakrah/Mesaieed Road, connecting Doha to the south of the country. Finally, Salwa Road runs through south Doha and connects the city to the Saudi border to the south of the country. These highways are all currently undergoing expansion, and are being expanded within Doha itself. =Doha Expressway (D‚ÄëRing Road/Al Shamal Road)= The Al Shamal-Road has traditionally connected to the D‚ÄëRing Road in Doha, a three-lane dual carriageway that connects the city on a north-south axis. However, as a result of congestion, the D‚ÄëRing Road is being converted into a major highway through the city, and its name has been changed to the Doha Expressway, connecting Doha as a whole and connecting Doha with the north of Qatar. Several phases of the expressway have been completed, including the Al Shamal Bridge, the Landmark Interchange, the Gharaffa Interchange, and the Midmac/Salwa Road Interchange. The Al Shamal Road is also undergoing significant expansion as part of the Doha Expressway project. The road is being expanded into a four-lane highway (a total of eight lanes) with major interchanges which will better serve the country than the existing two-lane dual carriageway. Furthermore, the new Doha Expressway will connect Doha with the planned Qatar-Bahrain Friendship Bridge at al‚ÄëZubara, connecting the two Persian Gulf states in a similar manner Bahrain and Saudi Arabia are currently connected. =Al Khor Coastal Road= Commutes between Doha and the municipality of Al Khor are currently facilitated Al Khor Coastal Road, which runs through Al Daayen. =Lusail Expressway= The Lusail expressway is expected to connect the new city of Lusail, currently being constructed north of Doha, to central Doha, along with connecting the Pearl island to the mainland. The expressway is expected to take the path along the former Istiqlal Road, now Lusail Street, and will be a 4‚Äëlane dual carriageway passing through the city. The expressway will extend from Lusail City, through Rainbow roundabout, the Qatar Sports Club roundabout, and the fire department roundabout. =Dukhan Highway= Doha is linked to the country's western settlements, namely Dukhan, through Dukhan Highway. The Public Works Authority carried out the Dukhan Highway Central Project in 2017 to enhance the road network. =Salwa Highway= The Salwa Highway project's first phase has been completed. This phase involved the expansion of the highway, which connects Doha to the southwestern town of Salwa on the Saudi Arabian border, into a four-lane highway with grade separated interchanges. The rest of Salwa Road is expected to be expanded and upgraded, from the recently completed Industrial Area Interchange to the Jaidah flyover, including the construction of an underpass at the Ramada signals, Doha's busiest traffic light intersection. This project is not expected to commence until after the completion of the Doha Expressway. =F‚ÄëRing Road= The F‚ÄëRing Road will be the sixth ring road in Doha, and is being constructed as part of the transportation network leading to the New Doha International Airport. The new highway will connect the airport to the corniche at the new Ras Abu Aboud interchange, currently under construction, and will involve a new ring road south of the E‚ÄëRing Road. Taxis The state-owned Mowasalat company was founded in 2004 to run the country's public transportation. It operates all taxis in Qatar under the \\"Karwa\\" brand, with thousands of taxis in the capital. Taxi stands are usually found near malls and shopping centers. In the past difficulties arose in finding Karwa taxis due to the small number of taxis available at launch, which gradually replaced all privately owned taxis. Fares start at 10 riyals and the majority of taxis are sedans such as the Toyota Camry and ≈†koda Octavias. Most airport taxis at the Doha International Airport are Ford Freestars.  Bus networks  Public bus network An extensive bus system solely operated by the state-owned Mowasalat commenced in October 2004. It runs in the city of Doha and most of the major towns with one route that terminates as far as the Saudi border. The system covers many areas of the capital city with varied bus stop configurations ranging from open stops to semi-covered and enclosed. The system is mainly used by lower-income segments as the network connectivity is not always feasible and most buses route to the main bus stop - which in itself is a semi-covered non-air conditioned space. This clubbed with the fact that most people prefer to use their private vehicles has not led to a major shift of the city's population to public networks. However, the Doha metro is expected to change that. The main bus terminal is located in the Souqs area of downtown Doha with services operating to all major towns in Qatar. Mowasalat operates a total of 50 routes starting as early as 4am with last buses timed to depart around 11pm. It also offers three routes that cover major stops terminating at the new Hamad International airport in Doha. The fleet also has buses that run on natural gas, having launched the region‚Äôs first CNG-fuelled buses. Mowasalat also provides transportation for public schools with a fleet of over 1800 buses. The company states that it plans to expand nationwide through six major bus stations, 16 depots and 1000 buses by 2020.  Shuttle network (West bay)  Qatar‚Äôs Ministry of Transport launched this shuttle service for the West Bay district to help ease congestion in this business district. It has been operated by state-owned transport company, Mowasalat. It provides a transport choice for tourists and residents alike and was expanded in 2016 to cover more areas in the district. The single route network operates from 6 am to 9 pm with a frequency of 15 minutes. Initially launched as a free service with two lines, both the blue line and the red line have been combined into a single route pay and use facility. The route was introduced with the objective to ease the parking challenges in the congested district which houses Ministries, government organizations, corporate towers, hotels, embassies & sports clubs. Some landmarks covered along the route include, Khalifa International Tennis and Squash Complex, The Doha Exhibition and Convention Center (DECC), Dafna Towers, Ministry of Justice tower, Public Works Authority (Ashghal) buildings, Sheraton grand Doha resort and convention center, City Center shopping mall, General Post office building and several government ministries towers. Tourist network (Doha Bus)  Doha Bus is a private operated hop on hop off service established in the spring of 2013. The network has a fleet of double-decker buses and has been designed to provide a flexible approach to discovery the capital. The major interest points covered on these routes include;  Souq Waqif (traditional market)  Museum of Islamic art  Katara (cultural landmark)  Pearl Island  Education city (Qatar Foundation)  City center (major shopping mall)  Grand Mosque  Doha Corniche (water front promenade)  Qatar National Convention Center File:Doha Bus.jpgOpen- top double-decker buses used only for sightseeing. It covers over 22 stops focusing only on areas of tourist interest. File:Doha Karwa public bus.jpgThe public bus network 'Mowasalat' operational since 2004 now covers around 50 routes inclusive of all of Qatar's towns. Railways The Qatar Integrated Railway Project covers four metro lines in Doha, tram routes in West Bay and Lusail, a high-speed line, and dedicated freight railways. Doha Metro Red Line has opened on the 8th of May 2019 for commuters to travel in, from al Qassar station to al Wakra (13 stations). Other lines and stations are yet to be completed. A four-line, 300-kilometer (190 mi) metro is under construction. Construction work on the Msheireb station‚Äîplanned as the hub between‚ÄîOctober 10, 2012, to mark the start of work on the key terminal station at Msheireb, which will form the hub of the Doha metro network. The system will include commuter lines, four light rail lines, and a people mover. In August Qatar Rail signed five contracts totaling 1.48 billion riyals for work on the first phase of the metro, which covers 129 route-kilometers including the Red, Green, and Gold lines. The contracts were awarded to Porr/Saudi Binladin/HBK Contracting (enabling works), Jacobs Engineering (Red Line), Louis Berger/Egis Group (Gold Line and main stations), Hill International (Green Line), and Lloyd's Register (safety assessment). According to the CEO of Qatar Rail, Phase 1 is due to open in the fourth quarter of 2019, well ahead of the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Overall, Doha Metro will consist of four lines: in addition to the aforementioned Red Line, Gold Line, and Green Line which will be built in the first phase, the Blue Line is expected to be completed in the second phase. Msheireb Station will be the point of intersection for all of the metro lines. The Red Line (also known as Coast Line) will extend through Doha, running from Al Wakrah to Al Khor. It is separated into two divisions: Red Line North and Red Line South. The former will run from Mushayrib Station to Al Khor City, over a length of 55.7 km. Doha Metro's Green Line will connect Doha to Education City and is also known as the Education Line. Starting in Old Airport, the Gold Line (also known as Historic Line) will end in Al Rayyan and cover a distance of 30.6 km. Lastly, the Blue Line, or City Line, will only cover the city of Doha, and is planned to be circular with a length of 17.5 km. Lusail LRT The city of Lusail, which is located approximately north of Doha's city center, is getting a light rail transit system comprising 25 stations over . It will connect to the Doha metro. The opening of the Lusail LRT is expected for 2020. West Bay Tram Doha's West Bay neighborhood is also getting a transit system, an catenary-free tramway, which will also serve Education City. The turnkey-system, constructed by Siemens and utilizing its latest Avenio tramcars with supercapacitor technology, is expected to open in 2015. Gulf Railway The Gulf Railway is a proposed railway project that would connect the six Arab member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)‚ÄîBahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates‚Äîof the Persian Gulf. The regional network would be long. It is planned to be operational by 2017. A monorail system is expected to be the first to open, and will carry passengers between Bahrain and Saudi Arabia. According to initial planning documents, the metro lines will be mostly underground, which could be a challenge for engineers due to the high water table. Aviation Aircraft parking bay at the former Doha International Airport Doha International Airport was Qatar's International airport until 2014. It was the hub of Qatar Airways, and was also served by many other International airlines. Because of the rapid growth in Qatar and the rapid growth of Qatar Airways, the airport was deemed too small and inadequate for the traffic that went through. This problem was addressed with a large expansion that was made in anticipation of the 15th Asian Games. The airport's facilities were expanded significantly, including the construction of a separate first and business class terminal. Furthermore, parking bays had been constructed on the opposite side of the runway to handle additional air traffic. All these changes had temporarily eased the problem but because of the airport's small size and limited space for expansion, it was not effective to permanently solve the crowding problem. Hamad International Airport constructed about 4 km East of the former airport replaced it as the only International airport in QatarAirguideOnline.com: Global Perspectives - Qatar's New Doha International Airport This airport has been partially built out at sea on 60% reclaimed land. Next to the airport 100 hectares have been set aside for an Airport City. Commenced in 2006, the initial phases of the airport are completed and the third phase is ongoing. It received its first passengers in 2014 and when completed it will be able to accommodate around 50 million passengers annually.Information on the New Doha International Airport The new airport is located on the shore, further away from the central areas of the city than the current airport, reducing noise and environmental pollution. 2 parallel runways are operational, the western one being the eighth longest in the world at 4850 meters. The airport's 600,000 sq m passenger terminal has a check-in hall that comprises a 25,000 sq m column- free space with around 130 check-in counters. One of the largest maintenance hangars worldwide is located at the airport said to be able to cater to 13 aircraft at once. This airport is also one of the first ever designed specifically for the double-deck Airbus A380.

Plot David (Leslie Phillips) and Catherine Robinson (Geraldine McEwan) have inherited a large but rundown country house. David suggests they now have room to increase their family beyond their son, but, after a number of his previous business ventures have failed, his wife demurs. However, she does agree to his idea to use the house as a summer holiday home for the children of the wealthy. By advertising in The Times, they attract a number of customers, and hire a matron (June Jago) and a cook (Joan Hickson), but immediately fall foul of a local councillor, Mrs Spicer (Irene Handl), who wants the local authority to compulsorily purchase the house for a project of her own. The children arrive, and while some are polite, scared and helpful, others are wild, spoilt, and rebellious, including an American brother and sister, and an English girl (Julia Lockwood) who insists (falsely) that she has been maltreated by her parents. As the children grow increasingly ill- disciplined, the Robinsons and the staff struggle to keep them under control. David advocates a tough approach, while Catherine believes that the children should be allowed their freedom, but they are both undermined by a cook who is drunk most of the time. After an illicit midnight trip out to a nearby caf√©, the children are grounded for two days. Then the Robinsons hear that the local council is sending an inspector, who may close them down if they fail the test. They rally the staff and children, who all behave correctly when the inspector and Mrs Spicer visit. When the time arrives for the children's parents to come to collect them, David tells them that the children are refusing to leave unless their parents promise to spend more time with them and not send them away to holiday homes and boarding schools. After the parents agree, all the children depart. Impressed by what she has seen, Mrs Spicer says she will no longer oppose the holiday home business. When their son protests at having lost his playmates, Catherine tells David that perhaps they should now have more children of their own.

An attorney, she became president of the Native Women's Association of Canada (NWAC), serving 2004-2009, and is best known for her work in advocating for the families of missing and murdered Indigenous women, and seeking changes to policing and the justice system to better serve Indigenous peoples. She is currently an Assistant Professor at the Faculty of Law, University of Windsor. Personal life Beverley K. Jacobs (Gowehgyuseh) was born in 1965 into the Bear Clan of her mother, in the Mohawk Nation on the Six Nations of the Grand River Territory, in Southern Ontario. Her traditional name, Gowehgyuseh, means \\"She's visiting.\\" She has a daughter, Ashley, and four grandchildren: Nicholas, Tessa, Bryson and Kenna.\\"Native Leaders of Canada\\", New Federation Education After spending some time working as a legal secretary, Jacobs decided to pursue a career as a lawyer. She juggled law school with the responsibilities of being a single mother. Often because she had no alternative, Jacobs brought her daughter Ashley, then eight, to class with her. The only Aboriginal student in her first year at University of Windsor, Jacobs started the First Nations Law Students Society on campus. She graduated from University of Windsor in 1994, then obtained her Master's degree in Law from the University of Saskatchewan in 2000.Paul Riggi, \\"Bev Jacobs: A Sister in Spirit\\" , University of Windsor Alumni Magazine Jacobs has also completed a multi-disciplinary PhD in Law, Sociology and Aboriginal Health at the University of Calgary. Career Bear Clan Consulting After leaving university, Jacobs became a consultant, launching her firm Bear Clan Consulting. She advises clients on issues such as Bill C-31, Residential Schools, Matrimonial Real Property, and Aboriginal Women's health issues. Amnesty International Jacobs' consulting work led to a project at Amnesty International that changed the course of her life and career. In 2004 she wrote the Stolen Sisters Report, a ground-breaking document that exposed the racialized and sexualized violence suffered by Indigenous women in Canada, and the failure of law enforcement to protect them or to prosecute their attackers. It helped catalyze the founding of the Sisters In Spirit movement, which worked to push government, police, and media to pay attention to the growing number of missing and murdered Indigenous woman in Canada, and the large number of unsolved cases.\\"Bev Jacobs on Canada's murdered and missing indigenous women\\", CBC: As it Happens, 14 April 2015 Native Women's Association of Canada In 2004 Jacobs entered the world of Indigenous politics, running and winning the election for President of the Native Women's Association of Canada (NWAC), largely on her work with families of missing and murdered aboriginal women. Jacobs was re-elected for a second term as President of NWAC in 2006. As president of NWAC Jacobs negotiated $10 million in funding from the federal government to support research into 500 of the missing and murdered Indigenous women, to create a national registry, a hotline, and public education programs. Vigils became a hallmark of the Sisters in Spirit movement. Families of the missing and murdered would gather with pictures of the missing women, sometimes lighting candles or releasing balloons all as a means of trying to attract media attention to their cause. Bridget Tolley, an Algonquin woman whose mother was killed by Quebec police in 2001, is credited with proposing the idea to NWAC as a media strategy. Dana Wray, \\"March and vigil honours missing and murdered Native women\\", McGill Daily, October 6, 2012\\"Families share memories of missing and murdered Aboriginal women\\" , Metro News, 4 October 2015 In her role as president, Jacobs attended the 2008 meeting at which Prime Minister Stephen Harper formally apologized to survivors for abuses under the residential school system.CANADA APOLOGIZES-06 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxc1TNWKFoM Jacobs chose not to run in the 2009 election.

He was first reporter at, then the editor of, the Windhoek Advertiser until 1978 when he and Gwen Lister founded the Windhoek Observer, the country's only Saturday paper at that time. He remained the owner and editor of the Observer until his death. Personal Smith was born in Grootfontein, Otjozondjupa Region. His parents were Angolan Afrikaners whose families participated in the Dorsland Trek. Smith started suffering from Alzheimer's disease in June 2008, and died on 5 August 2008 as a result of the disease. Editorial work According to Andreas Rothe, Smith was honoured by his competitors as a \\"legendary muckraker\\" who \\"did not bow to the South African nor the SWAPO government.\\" After Lister left the newspaper in 1984, Smith ran it as a one-man operation, calling himself \\"reporter-in-chief\\". His daughter, Yanna Erasmus, later joined him at the newspaper. 1959 Old Location controversy In August 2003, President Sam Nujoma and Smith became involved in a conflict regarding the 1959 Old Location Massacre, which saw a number of black protestors shot by the South African Police. Nujoma wrote in his autobiography, Where Others Wavered: The Autobiography of Sam Nujoma, that the wounded were denied medical treatment by white medical staff, including those at the small Red Cross Society clinic. Smith, a young reporter in Windhoek at the time of massacre, challenged that claim, stating that he had personally witnessed injured blacks receiving treatment. Nujoma responded by accusing Smith of \\"blackmail\\" and dishonesty.

Transposition is typically done by either primary legislation or secondary legislation. The European Commission closely monitors that transposition is timely, correctly done and implemented, so as to attain the results intended. Incorrect transposition may be the result of non acting (leaving aside certain provisions), diverging (other scope, definition or requirement), \\"gold-plating\\" (exceeding the requirements of the directive), \\"double-banking\\" (overlapping between existing national laws and the transposed directive), or \\"regulatory creep\\" (overzealous enforcement or a state of uncertainty in the status of the regulation). The European Commission may bring a case in the European Court of Justice against states which have not transposed directives adequately. Additionally, any individual or business in a Member State may lodge a complaint with the Commission about the incorrect or delayed transposition of an EU directive or \\"for any measure (law, regulation or administrative action) or practice attributable to a Member State which they consider incompatible with a provision or a principle of EU law\\".

It was based on the 1954 novel Smugglers' Circuit by Denys Roberts. The film was started by director Henry Cornelius who died whilst making the film. He was replaced by Charles Crichton. Plot Percy Brand is a career criminal, a veteran of various cons and schemes, and he is regularly sent to prison by judge Sir Edward Crichton. That does not bother Percy too much, but what does concern him is that his son, Colin, should not discover what his father does. Percy tells him tales about being a missionary in China when he is released in 1938, a military chaplain in North Africa in 1941, and a freed prisoner of war in 1946 to cover his absences in gaol. While Percy is \\"away\\", Colin is cared for by Aunt Florence who knows what Percy really does. When Colin grows up, he chooses to become a barrister. By coincidence, it will take him seven years to achieve his goal, the same duration as Percy's latest sentence. When Percy is freed, he arrives just after Colin is called to the bar. Colin informs him that he has secured a position as an unpaid marshal, i.e. an aide, to a judge to gain experience, and not just to any judge, but to Percy's nemesis, Edward Crichton. Percy decides to retire from his life of crime rather than risk coming into court and Colin seeing him there. Retirement to a cottage on the south coast of England is not enough to keep Percy (and Florence) out of mischief. When he hears about the smuggling that took place before the conscientious Police Sergeant Bolton arrived, Percy gets involved in bringing in brandy from France, hidden inside sharks he \\"catches\\". Then an old acquaintance, \\"Major Proudfoot\\", comes to see him. Proudfoot has planted a story that an explorer was murdered and robbed of 100,000 quid of emeralds he found in Brazil. Now he has a buyer lined up for the non-existent jewels, which he wants Percy to pretend to smuggle in. Percy has a better idea, involving fake policemen and himself as a customs officer, but the plan goes awry when Judge Crichton arrives to meet his wife, returning from a trip abroad. Percy manages to steal a launch, but is eventually caught. To compound his misfortune, he is to be tried by Crichton, a last-minute substitute for a judge afflicted with gout. Florence comes up with the idea to add a fake case to the docket to occupy Crichton's remaining time on that particular circuit court, with the assistance of Percy's friends and associates. Mary Cooper brings her publican husband into court over a slander repeatedly uttered by their pet parrot. However, the judge becomes fed up with the case and finally dismisses it, leaving Percy's trial for the next day. The gang then try to frame Crichton for smuggling by planting contraband in the car they arrange for the judge and Colin to take that night, and then making an anonymous call to tip off the customs agents. Crichton decides to take a walk first, and he and Colin get lost. They inadvertently trigger a burglar alarm when they reach a house and are taken at gunpoint to the police station. Colin later \\"confesses\\" in order to try to straighten things out, but is not in time to prevent the judge and Percy from being driven in the same van to the assizes. Along the way, Percy confesses everything to Crichton, who is amused. He sends Colin on an errand so that, when Percy is brought into the courtroom, Colin is absent. The judge then recuses himself, as he has had social contact with the defendant, leaving Colin none the wiser. Out on bail, but expecting another long prison sentence, Percy bids farewell to Colin, telling him that he has come out of retirement for one more trip.

Although he never cracks a smile, chances are he will force a few on the customers. As a matter of fact, they should find most of the cheerful disorders in Law and Disorder irreverently funny and diverting\\". The TV Guide review stated it had \\"a tight screenplay, with not a word wasted, and sharp acting by some of England's best characters.

Published weekly, the comic focuses on a young ice hockey goaltender named Small Saves and his adventures.  Overiew  The strip takes place in a small, unnamed northeast US town. Small Saves is about nine years old and plays goaltender for a team of children competing against other children's teams. Small Saves always wears his game jersey and his goaltending helmet, even when sleeping. When not in a game, though, he wears his helmet tipped back on his head. He wears #1, the traditional goalie jersey number. Small Saves is very talented at his position but when he has a bad game, or loses a game, he does so in spectacular fashion. He often instigates dressing room pizza fights among his teammates, much to the consternation of his coaches and league officials. His family is proud of Small Saves and he is friendly with his teammates and members of opposing teams alike. He is also very proud of his equipment, hosting parties at his home when a new piece of equipment arrives. His equipment is always pictured as retro, leather-and-wood equipment, tan-brown in color. His mask is plain, undecorated white. He has no doubts about his future vocation: Hall of Fame professional goaltender. Other characters * Mom: Small Saves' devoted hockey mom frequently has to resort to tricks to get Small Saves to do anything not related to hockey, such as telling him a game starts in 15 minutes in order to get him up for school. * Mia: Small Saves' cat, who also wears a goalie mask tipped back on his head. Mia is based on artist James DeMarco's real-life cat, also named \\"Mia.\\" * The Coach: The Coach, name unknown, is the long-suffering manager of Small Saves' team. It is frequently The Coach who deals with Small Saves' reactions to bad losses. * The Defenseman: The Defenseman, named Dee, is a female teammate. She is notable for being the only player on Small Saves' team who does not wear a helmet, her long red hair, and her ever-present dark sunglasses. She is always willing to go toe-to-toe with Small Saves exchanging trash talk with her teammate. The artist James \\"Jay\\" DeMarco started playing ice hockey as a goaltender at age 5 and at age 56 still plays regularly. His experience included prep hockey in Watertown, Mass. and three years of semi-professional play in the South Florida Hockey League. Afterwards, DeMarco returned to Boston. He earned an Associate Degree in Commercial Art at Bunker Hill Community College. Later work as a graphic designer developed his drawing style, while continuing to indulge his passion for goaltending in local adult leagues. Goaltending contributes to the perspective needed to create the strip. \\"From your vantage point,\\" DeMarco says, \\"you get to see the best and worst of your team, and you need to balance your desire to scream with the ability to laugh.\\" Small Saves debuted in 1991. DeMarco says that while writing the comic isn't hard, it is tough to keep it fresh given the specific subject matter of an ice hockey goalie. DeMarco draws the comic by hand on paper, pencilling it then inking it, and then coloring a copy to preserve the original. The comic is a part-time job for DeMarco, who also works at a nursing home, does silk-screening, and helps out at a skating rink. James says that his fascination for cartooning began very young, drawing inspiration from classics such as The Family Circus, Peanuts and Dennis the Menace. In addition to Small Saves, He also illustrated a children's book about ice hockey, written by Darren Hersh, called Holy Moly, We Need a Goalie!: Robbin to the Rescue! DeMarco has also authored and illustrated another children's book called The Dinosaurs of Winter. Distribution Small Saves has appeared in hockey-related publications such as USA Hockey Magazine, Independent Sports News, Goalie's World magazine and InsideHockey, and is linked through NHL.com. DeMarco has said his aim is for Small Saves \\"to be in every hockey media type there is.\\" The Canadian Make-a-Wish foundation publishes a black-and-white version of the strip in coloring books that it provides to children in hospitals. Compendiums Eight volumes of collected Small Saves cartoons have been published. These include:   Merchandise  Small Saves has a variety of merchandise, including T-shirts, mugs, stickers, and coasters.

It is an initiative that started with a partnership with the University of Vermont in collaboration with the National Science Foundation, currently funded by the MacArthur Foundation Digital Media and Learning program as well as other foundations and corporations, wherein students have the opportunity to form teams with international counterparts and work towards a solution to mitigate global warming and help envision the future of renewable energy. The program is an online educational environment that uses game based learning, simulation and Web-based science resources in a global competition. It relies on the personal initiative and creativity of students working in diverse teams. The access to the project via the Web makes it possible for students, parents, homeschooling families, teachers and interested global community members to get involved to help young people with their creative ideas for innovation in new forms of energy, conservation and increased productivity. History Founded in 2005 by Craig Deluca and David Rocchio of the Arno Group and Biddle Duke, the publisher of the Stowe Reporter newspaper company in Stowe, Vt., working in close partnership with Domenico Grasso of The University of Vermont (see) College of Engineering and Mathematical Sciences, the program gives international student teams the opportunity to experience the excitement of scientific understanding and engineering design while working on significant human and societal issues ‚Äì bringing science to life in innovative new applications. The program mission is to \\"give students the tools and confidence to solve global problems together.\\" The overarching model for the learning experiences offered worldwide to any student was influenced by The George Lucas Foundation's Big ideas For Better Schools, the Partnership for 21st Century SchoolsPartnership for 21st Century Schools and game based learning. The Global Challenge was funded in part by a National Science Foundation award from the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students (ITEST) program, validating the project's design for engaging youth in science, technology, engineering and mathematics learning. Since its founding in 2005, The Global Challenge has reached over 100,000 people worldwide and engaged over 4,000 students from 60 countries in forming teams to solve the challenge. About $200,000 in scholarships, travel, summer study have been provided to over 200 students from 10 countries. International connections The Global Challenge Award is responsible for identification of high school students who represent the United States in the International Earth Science Olympiad or IESO. Students and teachers travel to South Korea in 2007 and the Philippines in 2008. Plans are now underway to form a US-IESO selection process with the support of the American Geological Institute. In addition, the design of the program builds international student teams. Students from over 79 countries participate each year. Top countries by participation with over 100 students each year have been the United States, India, China, and South Korea. Program elements There are several project areas in the Challenge. Some are designed specifically for teams, others students can work on alone. Students can mix and match projects based on their interest level and time. They can form a team to compete in one competition and, at the same time, work on individual points. * Global Business Plan Students build an international team, envision a global solution, create a detailed business plan, and submit it for judging. * Technical Innovation Plan Students build an international team, envision any kind of technical solution, explain it to a panel of judges. * Explorations Students work on their own on science, technology, engineering and mathematics units of study called \\"challenges.\\" * Green Earth Corps Students work on their own or with any team, build a home and business auditing service, earn while they learn and serve. * GCA-350 Students create an awareness event about the need to reach \\"350 parts per million\\" of CO2 in the atmosphere. Each Challenge earns certain points, and in the end, teams with the highest scores win and earn scholarships, travel awards to the Governor's Institute on Engineering in Vermont, cash prizes, and tuition scholarships. News coverage The program was the lead story \\"Save the World\\" in Learning & Leading with Technology November 2007. In the Burlington Free Press in July 2008, and has led to a number of youth- authored articles on Cogito.org, for example: Using Nanotechnology for Cost Effective Converters as well as Educating Myself, International Style. Future plans The Challenge's founders envision creating a World Game space for STEM learning.

At 21, he moved to New York to study art and was apprenticed under Walter Satterlee in 1880. He became an instructor in Satterlee's still life class and studied at the Art Students' League. In 1884, Daingerfield left Satterlee and met George Inness. The works of Inness, Albert Pinkham Ryder, and Kenyon Cox \\"inspired his visionary style\\", according to the art historian Stephanie J. Fox. Daingerfield was also influenced by the European Symbolists whose work he encountered during his time studying in Europe . In the late 1890s he achieved recognition for paintings of religious subjects, an example of which is his mural in the Church of Saint Mary the Virgin in New York City. In 1902, he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an associate member; he became a full member in 1906. Daingerfield wrote a number of articles on art, including the essay \\"Nature versus Art\\" published in 1911 in Scribner's Magazine. He published a biography of George Inness in 1911, and a biography of Ralph Albert Blakelock in 1914. Daingerfield traveled to the American West in 1911 and 1913, and made seven paintings of the Grand Canyon. He married twice. His first wife, Roberta Strange French, died during childbirth in 1891. His second wife, Anna Grainger (married 1895), bore two daughters named Gwendoline and Marjorie. Elliott Daingerfield died in 1932 and is buried in Cross Creek Cemetery at Fayetteville.

Symptoms and signs Onset is usually confined to infancy and early childhood, with peak prevalence at 18‚Äì36 months. In rare cases, particularly where the child is severely mentally impaired, onset may extend to adolescence. The classical symptoms of the syndrome are spasmodic torticollis and dystonia. Nodding and rotation of the head, neck extension, gurgling, writhing movements of the limbs, and severe hypotonia have also been noted. Spasms may last for 1‚Äì3 minutes and may occur up to 10 times a day. Ingestion of food is often associated with occurrence of symptoms; this may result in reluctance to feed. Associated symptoms, such as epigastric discomfort, vomiting (which may involve blood) and abnormal eye movements have been reported. Clinical signs may also include anaemia. Diagnosis Diagnosis is made on the basis of the association of gastro- oesophageal reflux with the characteristic movement disorder. Neurological examination is usually normal. Misdiagnosis as benign infantile spasms or epileptic seizures is common, particularly where clear signs or symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux are not apparent. Early diagnosis is critical, as treatment is simple and leads to prompt resolution of the movement disorder. Treatment Successful treatment of the associated underlying disorder, such as GORD or hiatus hernia, may provide relief. Prognosis Sandifer syndrome is not typically life-threatening and the prognosis is typically good. History Sandifer syndrome was first described in 1964 by Austrian neurologist Marcel Kinsbourne in The Lancet. Kinsbourne named the syndrome after his mentor, British neurologist Paul Sandifer, who had initially cared for the patients described in Kinsbourne's case reports.

This article presents information on references to several historical people in such works. Akechi Mitsuhide Akechi Mitsuhide is featured in various fictional works, mostly as a hero. *He will be portrayed by Hiroki Hasegawa in the lead role in the upcoming 2020 NHK taiga drama Kirin ga Kuru. *He is featured in Capcom's Onimusha as Samanosuke Akechi's uncle/relative, as well as Onimusha Tactics, as a playable character. *Mitsuhide is also one of the playable characters in Koei's Samurai Warriors series. He wields a katana, obviously taking techniques from the sword school of Iaido, and is portrayed to have a very close relationship with Mori Ranmaru. He goes against Oda Nobunaga but lets him live in one story. In another story, he is forced to kill Oda Nobunaga and Mori Ranmaru. In the second installment of the series, the relationship with Ranmaru is not present; instead he becomes closer to Nobunaga (and takes longer to fall out with Nobunaga) to a point where he does not want to kill him. This caused Saika Magoichi to assassinate Nobunaga from afar, leaving Mitsuhide to be blamed. Akechi Mitsuhide somehow defeats the Toyotomi and the Saika, uniting the land in Nobunaga's name. In a special side story, he has to fight off and defeat the Tokugawa and the rest of Japan. He also appears in the Warriors Orochi spin-off series as a starting character in the \\"Samurai\\"/\\"Sengoku\\" story lines. In this game, he shows no intention of killing or betraying Oda Nobunaga and follows him faithfully; in fairness, this depiction is based on the Samurai Warriors 2 incarnation. In Warriors Orochi 2, he and Hosokawa Gracia, his daughter, are rescued by Xing Cai and Inahime. They become allies of Shu, and they tell Liu Bei of Taira Kiyomori and Sun Wukong. He has a dream mode stage where he teams up with Ling Tong and Yue Ying to battle Masamune Date.

He then faked his death and became the High Buddhist priest called Tenkai, manipulating the Tokugawa from within. *In the James Clavell historical novel Sh≈çgun, the character of \\"Akechi Jinsai\\" is a pastiche of Mitsuhide. *Akechi Mitsuhide is one of few captains who have non-generic faces in the eroge Sengoku Rance. He can be replaced with his daughter Hosokawa Gracia, after doing two of his events using Rance's satisfaction points. *In the anime series Sengoku Otome: Momoiro Paradox, Mitsuhide is portrayed as a gender-switched version of himself, played by Eri Kitamura. *In the anime series The Ambition of Oda Nobuna, Mitsuhide is portrayed as a female protagonist serving Oda Nobuna. *In Drifters, he appears as a member of the Ends voiced by Sho Hayami. *In the Custom Game Mode of Warcraft III The Frozen Throne, One of the Selectable Heroes from the Orc Faction, is a Blade Master, with Various Names.

In his story mode ending, Yoshimoto miraculously manages to defeat both Takeda Shingen and Oda Nobunaga in Kyoto, and then plays kemari to his heart's content in front of the other warlords, who look on in amusement and disgust. **In Samurai Warriors 2 however, due to time constraints (as well as an overall shift away from Nobunaga's life towards the post-Nobunaga years), the Battle of Okehazama was shown as part of Nobunaga, Noh, and Mitsuhide's intro movies, and Yoshimoto was only mentioned and shown impaled to death within his palanquin by Nobunaga's spearmen. **However, in Samurai Warriors 2: Xtreme Legends, the battle was brought back, and Yoshimoto himself is given an updated appearance and additional moves as well as a new story mode that tells about his quest for somebody to play kemari with him due to his extreme loneliness. **He is once again made a free mode only character for Samurai Warriors 3.

In the anime, he was portrayed as a coward, weak and a pathetic leader that uses his men as scapegoats to save himself, but he was killed by Oda Nobunaga. *In the translation of Path of the Assassin, a Dark Horse Comics translation of Hanzo no Mon, which focuses on Tokugawa Ieyasu and Hattori Hanz≈ç's perspectives, Yoshimoto is viewed more positively (perhaps ironically, compared to Nobunaga) and even decides during the Okehazama campaign to replace Ujizane with Ieyasu (then Matsudaira Motoyasu) as his heir, though dying before doing so. *Imagawa Yoshimoto is the Hanny's king who rules a province full of hannys in the eroge Sengoku Rance. *He also appears briefly in the short manga Kacchu no Senshi Gamu by Yoshihiro Takahashi. *Yoshimoto appears as a gender-switched character in Sengoku Otome: Momoiro Paradox. *In Sengoku Basara, he was portrayed as a coward general that attacks with puny force, retreating further and using his subordinates as decoys by raising them as the same rank.

In Sengoku Basara 3, she now appears without her naginata, rather having her demonic hands be used as weapons. *The gunner mercenary in Atlantica Online is based on Oichi, referencing her brother's claim to fame by using gunners in the battle of Nagashino. *Oichi was named Oyu in Onimusha 2, in which she works with Yagyu Jubei, Saika Magoichi, Ekei Ankokuji, and Fuma Kotaro in defeating her brother.

She will help the player during the first story line. *Oichi appears as a minor character in the social romance sim Samurai Love Ballad (Â§©‰∏ãÁµ±‰∏ÄÊÅã„ÅÆ‰π± Love Ballad) produced by Voltage (company). ≈åtani Yoshitsugu *≈åtani Yoshitsugu becomes a playable character in Samurai Warriors 4. His appearance with a white mask was inspired by his iconic exploits at Sekigahara for simple recognition. He is Ishida Mitsunari's loyal friend who sided with him at Sekigahara. *Yoshitsugu has made an appearance as a masked samurai of the Western army in Kessen. *Yoshitsugu is also a character in Koei's video game Saihai no Yukue. He is covered with bandages, due to his leprosy. *Yoshitsugu is a minor character in James Clavell's tale Shogun where he appears as a Leprous Christian Daimy≈ç called Onoshi. *Yoshitsugu is a character in Sengoku Basara 3 who rides a floating chair with orbs as weapons. *He also appeared in Sengoku Basara: The Last Party as Mitsunari's aide and lieutenant, doing anything to achieve Mitsunari's vengeance, alongside Oda Clan's Oichi.

Similar to Zhao Yun of the Dynasty Warriors series, Yukimura is the icon for Samurai Warriors and thus usually placed on the game manual/cover Perhaps because of this, in both games so far his lifespan and prominence have been greatly extended. In the first game, he was portrayed as Takeda Shingen's second-in-command even at the Fourth Battle of Kawanakajima - which occurred 6 years before he was born historically. In the second game, the extension is more modest, but he is still portrayed as a major Takeda officer at the Battle of Nagashino, when he would have been 8. Both games feature the Summer Siege of Osaka Castle as his last and most notable battle. In many character storylines and endings, he is killed in battle at Osaka Castle. In one of his SW endings, he, Kunoichi, Uesugi Kenshin, and Takeda Shingen unite the land. In his SW2 ending, he proves his strength to his friend Maeda Keiji, and he saves Naoe Kanetsugu. Together, they united the land in honor of Ishida Mitsunari. He is also in the spinoff called Samurai Warriors Katana. Throughout the games Yukimura had a somewhat romantic relationship with his bodyguard Kunoichi. In the related series Warriors Orochi he was tricked by Orochi into thinking that Zhao Yun and the other resistance were phantoms. After losing to Zhao Yun in a fight, he realized that he was deceived, and apologizing, compensated his error by joining forces with Zhao Yun to help rescue Liu Bei. In the sequel, he works with Shima Sakon and Zhang Jiao to save Naoe Kanetsugu. In Dream Mode, he works with Zhao Yun and Shimazu Yoshihiro in saving Liu Bei and peasants. *Akimine Kamijyo's popular anime and manga series Samurai Deeper Kyo has Sanada as a main character. He is depicted as a lighthearted, beautiful trickster with a love of battle, wine, women, and almost supernatural prowess as a tactician. He had a notable admiration for the then-late Toyotomi Hideyoshi. *In Capcom's series Sengoku Basara he is traditionally one of the main characters. He serves under Takeda Shingen alongside Sarutobi Sasuke and has a major rivalry with Date Masamune. He wields two yari spears. In Sengoku Basara 3 Yukimura becomes the commander of the Takeda forces after Shingen falls ill. Soichiro Hoshi provides Yukimura's voice in the games and anime. Kouhei Takeda plays him in the Live Action TV Drama. *In the popular anime and manga series Prince of Tennis, Japan's #1 school Rikkai Daigoku's captain is named Seiichi Yukimura, and their vice-captain is named Genichiro Sanada. Likewise, Echizen Ryoma, who defeated the two forementioned players, shares his last name with the commander whose troops killed Sanada Yukimura. *Sanada Yukimura appears in his own anime called Sanada Juyushi Special (together with his brother Angelo Sanada), directed by Shimizu Keizo. *Sanada Yukimura was portrayed by comedian Gino Jinnai in the movie Kamen Rider Den-O: I am Born!.

He is brave and very loyal to his lord Shingen. *In the anime series Girls und Panzer, the gunner of Team Hippo, Kiyomi Sugiyama, calls herself Saemonza, Yukimura's nickname. She also wears his mon of three columns of two coins as a headband. *In the video game Super Mario Odyssey, Mario can obtain a suit of samurai armor and helmet with a design similar to that of Yukimura's helmet, featuring antlers and his six-coin mon. *Yukimura is a playable character in the social romance sim Samurai Love Ballad (Â§©‰∏ãÁµ±‰∏ÄÊÅã„ÅÆ‰π± Love Ballad) produced by Voltage (company). *Yukimura is a playable character in the visual novel game (purchasable through Apple and Samsung) Ikemen Sengoku; Romances Across Time, produced by Cybird (company) *Yukimura is a primary antagonist in the video game Nioh second and third DLC expansions, Defiant Honor and Bloodshed's End. In here, he commands the forces sieged in the Osaka Castle, defending Toyotomi Hideyori from the Tokugawa forces. *In Oda Cinnamon Nobunaga, Yukimura is reincarnated in modern-day Japan as a Corgi nicknamed \\"Marutarou\\". Sasaki Kojir≈ç *Sasaki Kojir≈ç's famous battle with Miyamoto Musashi is the focus of the film Samurai III: Duel at Ganryu Island and the character appears in the previous film in the trilogy Samurai II: Duel at Ichijoji Temple. Both times he was played by K≈çji Tsuruta, opposite Toshir≈ç Mifune as Musashi. *The epic historical adventure fiction novel Musashi, by famed Japanese author Eiji Yoshikawa, features a separate parallel plotline and various sub-plots highlighting the exploits of Sasaki Kojir≈ç Ganry≈©. Eventually the Musashi and Kojir≈ç plotlines intertwine, with the pair's famous duel the climax and final chapter of the novel. **Yoshikawa's novel is the basis of the 42nd NHK taiga drama of the same name from 2003. The NHK serial retains the novel's plot structure, developing parallels between the lives of Sasaki and Musashi and thus rendering Sasaki as a major character, portrayed in the show by Matsuoka Matsuhiro. *In the game Brave Fencer Musashi, the title character's sworn rival was named after Kojir≈ç. And in Musashi: Samurai Legend, the main villain was named Gandrake (Ganry≈©). *The birth and growth of Sasaki Kojir≈ç is also featured in Vagabond by Takehiko Inoue, a manga dedicated to the life of Miyamoto Musashi, though in it, Sasaki Kojir≈ç is portrayed as being deaf and a good looking young man who was popular with the ladies. *In the manga Wangan Midnight, Gen Sasaki is named after Sasaki Kojir≈ç, as they share the family name, Sasaki. *In the manga Sh≈´matsu no Valkyrie, Sasaki Kojiro is the third fighter from humanity's side that fights against the God Poseidon. *In the manga by Masami Kurumada, Fuma no Kojiro, Sasaki Kojiro and Miyamoto Musashi are main characters. An Anime version of Fuma no Kojiro was released in 1992. *Kojir≈ç appears as the main spirit in the manga Kensei Tsubame (Ââ£ËÅñ„ÉÑ„Éê„É° lit. Sword Saint Tsubame), a story about kendo practitioners who become possessed by the spirits of many famous Japanese swordsmen. The protagonist, who is possessed by Kojir≈ç, is named Tsubame Kamoshita. His name is probably a reference to Kojir≈ç's technique. *In Pok√©mon, the Japanese name James (of Team Rocket) is Kojiro. Additionally, James's partner Jessie's Japanese name is Musashi, a reference to Miyamoto Musashi. *In the visual novel and anime series Fate/stay night, the Servant Assassin introduces himself as Sasaki Kojir≈ç. However, it is debated whether his true identity is actually Sasaki, as he claims that he only took Kojiro's name. In episode 18 of the anime, Saber recognizes Assassin as Kojiro. Assassin then claims Kojiro is but a fake name and that the person called Sasaki Kojirou does not exist; he is but a character with a fabricated past that has been made into a master swordsman inside people's memories. *In Samurai Warriors 2 by Koei, Kojiro appears as an enemy officer and an unlockable bodyguard, but not a playable character except through Nene's special ability (taking on the appearance and moveset of an officer nearby) and in Samurai Warriors 2: Empires. Kojiro is a playable character in Samurai Warriors 2: Xtreme Legends, with his own Story Mode, focused mainly on pursuing and fight Musashi. The ending features Kojiro becoming rather upset after killing Musashi, and his Dream Stage has Kojiro realizing that he wants to fight alongside Musashi, rather than kill him, and they battle their way through a series of officers and challenges to reach Oda Nobunaga. His skin color is bone white (possibly as white face paint), and he is depicted as an evil minded and bloodthirsty fiend who claims to give his enemies a \\"beautiful end\\". He appears in Warriors Orochi 2 where he joins the Samurai faction under Sakon Shima to be \\"closer to\\" Musashi. *Kibagami Genjyuro from the Samurai Shodown series, is based on Kojiro just as Haohmaru is based on Musashi. *In Gosho Aoyama's Yaiba, Sasaki Kojiro was revived from his death after the final battle with Miyamoto Musashi, Yaiba's teacher. He was brought to life by Yaiba's nemesis Onimaru in an attempt to defeat Yaiba. However, after a twisted turn of event he then join Yaiba and the gang. His reputation as cool, handsome, and know his way around girls as often portrayed in many fiction about him was parodied in this series as he is shown as a complete womanizer, playboy, and even has a radar for beautiful woman. His appearance in this series was almost entirely comedic although the same would also apply to almost all of the character. *In Dr. Slump, Arale, Gatchan, and Taro used the \\"Time Slipper\\" to travel to the day of Musashi's duel with Kojiro. It states that Musashi was late for the duel over a two-day game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. Kojiro is shown waiting impatiently for Musashi, and is left waiting after Musashi goes with Arale to the future. *Kojiro's Tsubame Gaeshi (Swallow Reversal/Turning Swallow) technique is used by Shusuke Fuji in Prince of Tennis, and by Sanada Kazuki in Fighting Spirit. The technique is also featured in Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game as the card \\"Swallow Flip\\", as well as in Pok√©mon game series as the move \\"Aerial Ace\\". It is also the signature technique for the character Seraphim in \\"Is This A Zombie?\\". *The sword Monohoshizao appears in Soul Blade, the first game of the popular Soulcalibur series of fighting games. It was an extra weapon for Heishiro Mitsurugi, but it was simply named \\"Kojiro's sword\\". It later became an alternate weapon for Yoshimitsu in the third part: Soulcalibur II where it is described as a sword that was used by the renowned Japanese swordsman named Kojiroh Sasaki. In Soulcalibur III, it appears as an alternate weapon for the bonus character Arthur, a counterpart to Mitsurugi who himself is based on Miyamoto Musashi. *Kojiro is an unlockable character in the Ubisoft/Genki game Sword of the Samurai. Which also has Ganryu Island a selectable arena. Also the game features Miyamoto with an actual oar instead of a self-modified oar- Suburito. *Akane Takeda, from the Visual Novel Hanachirasu, develops Kojiro's Tsubame Gaeshi technique to counter Igarasu Yoshia's Hiru-no-Tsuki, which is an attack in which Igarasu launches himself overhead to attack the back, thus Akane literally \\"Cuts a swallow from flight.\\" *In the 2011 video game Dark Souls it is possible to obtain an extremely long katana-class weapon named the Washing Pole (in the Japanese release it is named Áâ©Âπ≤„ÅóÁ´ø; lit. \\"Laundry Pole\\"), which is named as a reference to Kojiro's trademark weapon.http://w.livedoor.jp/project_dark/d/%ca%aa%b4%b3%a4%b7%b4%c8 The sword in the game is much longer than Kojiro's, however, its blade extending an astonishing 7 feet in a caricature of the Monohoshi Zao's extended length. Shibata Katsuie *Shibata Katsuie's army plays a major role in the 1953 classic film Ugetsu monogatari. *Shibata is a playable general in Koei's Kessen III in which he is clad in black 'Oni' armour, and looks the same facially in both Kessen III and Samurai Warriors 2, showing some continuity. he appears as a non-playable character in the sequel to Sengoku Period-based video game Samurai Warriors 2 as it's known in the US and Europe and also in Samurai Warriors Katana. He is available as an unlockable bodyguard through Samurai Warriors 2 'Survival' mode. He returns in the Empires expansion as a fully playable character. However, in Samurai Warriors 2 Xtreme Legends, uses a pair of hand-axes instead of a spear, making him a fully fledged unique character. In his story, he eventually gets to marry his love, Oichi, and he helps to teach Maeda Toshiie to be a true warrior. He and Oichi kill themselves by way of setting their castle on fire in his ending, preventing Hideyoshi from getting them as allies, and making Maeda Toshiie sad and upset. In Warriors Orochi 2, he works with Oda Nobunaga, Ishida Mitsunari, and Xiahou Dun at repelling Dong Zhuo and killing Taira Kiyomori at Tong Gate. In Dream Mode, he works with Maeda Toshiie, Sun Jian, Sun Ce, and Cao Ren in protecting Oichi from Yuan Shao and Liu Biao. *He is portrayed in the eroge Sengoku Rance as a children's lover so that Rance thinks he is a lolicon. He will eventually become Ranmaru's husband after doing Ranmaru's events to clear her. His feelings about K≈çhime, Oda Nobunaga Kazunosuke's younger sister, may be a pun of Shibata being the second husband of Oichi, younger sister of the true Oda Nobunaga. *Katsuie appears in Sengoku Basara 4 as a low-rank vanguard under the Oda force. In the past he tried to rebel but failed. He is despaired in everything to the point that he's even losing emotions. *He is also a character in the anime The Ambition of Oda Nobuna as a female protagonist serving Oda Nobunaga. *Katsuie appears as a minor character in the social romance sim Samurai Love Ballad (Â§©‰∏ãÁµ±‰∏ÄÊÅã„ÅÆ‰π± Love Ballad) produced by Voltage (company). Shima Sakon *Shima Sakon is a playable character in Samurai Warriors 2, where he is portrayed as a former servant of Takeda Shingen and wields an oversized falchion. He also makes vague impersonations of Elvis Presley, which are seen on his sideburns and his quotes (\\"Thank you. Thank you very much.\\", \\"Sakon... has left the battlefield.\\"). He must be defeated by the Eastern Army in the Battle of Kusegawa. In his ending, he and Ishida Mitsunari unite Japan. He also appears in the spinoff called Samurai Warriors Katana. He also appears in Warriors Orochi as an enemy and later ally in the Wu storyline. He developed a friendship with Lu Meng. In the sequel, Sakon is the leading character of one of the five storylines of the game, as Sakon unites the various samurai clans of Oda, Takeda and Uesugi, along with the Kingdom of Wu, in an attempt to prevent the resurrection of Orichi. He also develops a friendly relationship with the mystic Fu Xi. *He also appears in the Kessen series and in Samurai Warriors Katana. *Sakon appears in Onimusha: Dawn of Dreams, where his mind is twisted and brainwashed by Ophelia, one of the Genma Triumvirate. Tenkai Nankobo uses his purification skills to free Sakon of the evil mind-altering. *Sakon is a manga series loosely based on Sakon's life, illustrated by Tetsuo Hara. He survives Sekigahara and is ordered by his lord to disrupt a plot set by Tokugawa Ieyasu's kagemusha. *In the manga Tenjho Tenge authored by Oh! Great, a character is directly named after him, Sakon Shima. *Sakon is playable in Sengoku Basara 4 as a cheerful young man who enjoys gambling and his flirtatious look. He serves under Ishida Mitsunari. *Sakon appears as a minor character in the social romance sim Samurai Love Ballad (Â§©‰∏ãÁµ±‰∏ÄÊÅã„ÅÆ‰π± Love Ballad) produced by Voltage (company). *Sakon appears as a secondary antagonist in Nioh, being a loyal servant of Mitsunari who survives the battle of Sekigahara and is later present at his master's execution. Shimazu Yoshihiro *Shimazu Yoshihiro appears in the Koei game Kessen. *He also appears in Capcom's Sengoku Basara, where he wields a giant sword and a drunkard. In the game's sequel, Sengoku Basara 2, he is determined to duel Honda Tadakatsu to determine who is stronger. *Yoshihiro is present in Koei's Samurai Warriors 2. While still portrayed as an old man, he wields a giant mallet and has a rivalry with Tachibana Ginchiyo (heiress to the Tachibana of Kyushu), while the surprise attack before Sekigahara is proposed by Toyohisa (and rejected by Mitsunari for honor's sake) at the opening of the Sekigahara stage. He unites the land under the Shimazu. He also appears in the spin-off series Warriors Orochi as a starter character for Shu Han, alongside Zhao Yun and Xing Cai. He assists Xing Cai and the mystic Zuo Ci in freeing Zhao Yun from Orochi's prison in Ueda Castle. In the sequel, he joins the samurai alliance. He works with Huang Zhong in saving Lu Meng and Gan Ning from Lu Bu's forces. In Dream Mode, he works with Zhao Yun and Sanada Yukimura in rescuing Liu Bei and peasants. *In the eroge Sengoku Rance, the four brothers of Shimazu family are Yoshihisa, Kazuhisa, Toshihisa and Iehisa. While Yoshihisa, Toshihisa, Iehisa really were Yoshihiro's brothers, the second brother, Kazuhisa's name may be the reference of Shimazu Katsuhisa, Yoshihiro's father Takahisa's adopted father. *He was mentioned by Haruo Niijima in Kenichi: The Mightiest Disciple when Niijima was trapped and planned to use the method Shimazu used to charge through the Ragnorok's surroundings. *He is a playable character in Pok√©mon Conquest (Pok√©mon + Nobunaga's Ambition in Japan), with his partner Pok√©mon being Gurdurr and later Conkeldurr. Suzuki Magoichi In most of his fictional portrayals, Suzuki Magoichi is often referred to his more common name, Saiga Magoichi. *In Onimusha 2, Saika Magoichi is a calm musketeer trying to protect Saiga village from Nobunaga's army. He feels indebted to the women of the village because his mother died at a young age, so the women raised him. He raises doubts among Ankokuji Ekei and Yagyu Jubei (actually he was the first Jubei, grandfather of the infamous Yagyu Jubei Mitsuyoshi, Yagyu Muneyoshi) when Tokichiro Kinoshita/Toyotomi Hideyoshi accuses him of serving Nobunaga. This same Magoichi is also in Onimusha Tactics, as well as Onimusha Blade Warriors. He also served as a mentor to Ohatsu, Oichi's/Oyu's daughter, from Onimusha: Dawn of Dreams, tutoring her in the wielding of firearms. Judging from the timeline, it is likely that this Magoichi is Saika Shigehide. *Magoichi is also a playable character in the Samurai Warriors series, wielding in all installments a musket with underbarrel bayonet. Magoichi is laid back and dressed in a trench coat. He bears no resemblance to either Suzuki Shigetomo nor Suzuki Sadayu (in fact, he cannot be Suzuki Sadayu; Suzuki is a separate character in the sequel). He fights to protect the people he cares about most as well as for the ladies, and even makes a friendly rival out of Maeda Keiji. He has a slight womanizing obsession. In his story path, beginning with the Battle of Ise (a fictional representation of the fall of Nagashima), and following a continuing anti-Nobunaga campaign, one ending has him becoming a wanderer after the surrender of the Ishiyama Honganji (having joined their campaign against Nobunaga), whereas a second ending has him years later raiding Azuchi Castle and killing Nobunaga. *In Samurai Warriors 2, his storyline is revised to have him be a mercenary leader originally on friendly terms with Hashiba Hideyoshi, first fighting for Nobunaga at Anegawa and then opposing him in a later stage at Osaka Bay (intended to briefly touch on the Honganji). Angered by a retaliatory attack on his village (though he is able to mitigate the damage) and temporarily breaking his friendship with Hideyoshi, he rushes over to Honn≈ç-ji where, amidst the chaos, he shoots and kills Nobunaga, and repentant Akechi Mitsuhide is the one to take the blame. Ironically enough at the end of the Battle of Yamazaki (his final stage) while standing over Mitsuhide's body he is mortally wounded by a random shot in the back fired from offscreen, and his ending has him surviving long enough to stagger into camp before collapsing and apparently dying in Hideyoshi's arms. He is shown surviving in several endings however, even though they are set years after Yamazaki. In Date Masamune's ending, the two strike an alliance, a relationship that is shown further in Samurai Warriors 3. In Warriors Orochi, Magoichi helps Zhao Yun and his army to free Yue Ying from Orochi's forces, and later joins forces with Shu Han at the end of the stage. His personality still is of a womanizer, attempting to flirt with the female Chinese characters such as Xing Cai, Yue Ying, Da Qiao, Zhu Rong, and even, Orochi's strategist, Da Ji. He even attempts to flirt with Zhang He at one point, not knowing that the extremely feminine Zhang is a man. *Koei also depicts him in the Nobunaga's Ambition series (in particular installments XI and XII) and in Taikou Risshiden (in particular V). He also appears as an enemy general in Kessen III. *He is also a hidden playable character in Visco Games' arcade shoot 'em up Vasara 2, and is the grandfather of the female Saiga Magoichi in the original game, Vasara. *Magoichi are two of the captains who have generic faces in the eroge Sengoku Rance (they take the names \\"Saiga Magoichi\\" and \\"Saika Magoichi\\"). *Magoichi appears in Sengoku Basara 3, appearing this time as a woman named Saika Magoichi (or Lady Saika in historical records). As Magoichi was the common name for the leader of the Saika Renegades, it still fits. This version of Magoichi carries a set of revolvers and other firearms at her disposal. *He is a playable character in Pok√©mon Conquest (Pok√©mon + Nobunaga's Ambition in Japan), with his partner Pok√©mon being Grovyle and later Sceptile. He also appears as a womanizer in this game. Tachibana Ginchiyo *Tachibana Ginchiyo appears in Koei's Samurai Warriors series of video games. She is a popular character despite her debut and only appearance in Samurai Warriors 2, Samurai Warriors 2 Empires and Samurai Warriors 2: Xtreme Legends (not counting Warriors Orochi). In the game, she has a rivalry with Shimazu Yoshihiro, the daimy≈ç of Satsuma. In Xtreme Legends, she becomes an ally of Ch≈çsokabe Motochika alongside Shimazu Yoshihiro. In reference to her father Tachibana Dosetsu her attacks are centered on lightning; one of her special abilities is to summon a lightning storm, or augment her sword with a lightning attribute. In her ending, she forgives the Shimazu clan and lets them live, but Shimazu Yoshihiro dies from battle wounds. In the sequel, she is joined by her husband. She also gets the honor of being the first female character in the Warriors series as a whole to wield a sword. He is also a character in Samurai Warriors Katana, a spinoff of Samurai Warriors for the Nintendo Wii. She also appears in the Warriors Orochi crossover game. She is seen by Zhao Yun, Xing Cai, and Yoshihiro Shimazu, escaping Ueda Castle, at the same time Cai and Shimazu are freeing Zhao Yun. She escapes with them, and joins Zhao Yun's Shu Han forces. In the sequel, Okuni brings Ginchiyo to Wu. She works with her equal in strength, Zhu Rong, in defeating Cao Ren. In Dream Mode, she works with Imagawa Yoshimoto and Xing Cai in saving their allies in Chen Cang Castle.

Takeda Shingen The 1988 NHK Taiga drama television series Takeda Shingen is a fictionalized account of Takeda Shingen's life with Kiichi Nakai in the title role. His life is also dramatized in NHK's 46th Taiga drama F≈´rin Kazan. Akira Kurosawa's 1980 film Kagemusha was also inspired by his life; it brought the musket-wound theory to public attention outside Japan.

In the main story, Uesugi and Takeda fall at Nagashino, while Nobunaga's forces are at Guan Du. In the Gaiden stage, aid is sent by Nobunaga to Nagashino, in the form of Huang Zhong and Guan Ping. Takeda and Uesugi join with Nobunaga in the Wu Zhang Plains to defeat Orochi's forces. At Koshi Castle, the Takeda, the Uesugi, and the Oda kill Orochi.

It was directed by Walt Disney and animated by Ub Iwerks and Ben Sharpsteen. It was the sixth Mickey Mouse short to be produced, the third of that year. In this cartoon, Mickey and Minnie are the size of regular mice, and Tom Cat is the size of a person. Synopsis After Tom Cat leaves his house, drunk on hooch, Mickey organizes all his mice friends to break into the cat's house. Once inside, Mickey and Minnie play the piano by dancing on the keys and, later, others play some of the cat's musical instruments and records (using themselves as the speaker and stylus). In the end, Mickey and Minnie kiss. Production The cartoon is a loose remake of Disney's 1925 film Alice Rattled by Rats, from the Alice Comedies series. This is the last time Mickey is portrayed as the size of a mouse, although he remains fairly small in his next cartoon, The Barnyard Battle. The cat signs his name \\"Tom Cat\\", which was briefly used as a name for the character who was shortly afterwards identified as Peg-Leg Pete. In an early script, the cartoon ended with the pet parrot calling the police, causing the mice to scurry away. Voice cast * Mickey Mouse: Walt Disney * Minnie Mouse: Marcellite Garner * Tom Cat: unknown * Parrot: unknown Reception Motion Picture News (June 8, 1929): \\"This is one of the series of the Mickey Mouse cartoons. It is synchronized for sound, which brings the greater part of the laughs. The cat ahunting goes and the mice play while the cat's away. They play everything from the piano, right down the line of musical instruments.\\" The Film Daily (July 28, 1929): \\"Amusing. Mickey and his relatives crash their way into the cat's home while the latter is hunting. The results is a music festival which proves genuinely amusing.

BOR was founded by Secretarial Order in April 1962, and formally established with the passage of the National Outdoor Recreation Act (Public Law 88-29) in May 1963. The functions of Nationwide Planning and Cooperative Services were transferred from the National Park Service to BOR after its establishment. The Bureau was absorbed into a new agency, the Heritage Conservation and Recreation Service, in 1977. History In 1956, Mission 66 was established to help accommodate users during a period of increasing usage of recreation sites. After the Great Depression, many parks became more accessible as bad roads were replaced by the US highway system, which in turn was more usable because of the increasing availability of automobiles. A series of tests performed for Mission 66 indicated several opportunities for preservation of parks, parkways, and seashores. In 1958, Congress created the Outdoor Recreation Resources Review Commission (ORRRC) to determine recreation needs, inventory recreation resources, and to recommend policies and programs to \\"...ensure that the needs of the present and future are adequately and efficiently met.\\" ORRRC released its report in 1962, recommending the establishment of the BOR to help bring structure to outdoor recreation programs. Impacts Land and Water Conservation Fund The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) was created in 1965 by the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act (LWCFA).The ORRRC recommended this act to help the states in meeting the rising demand for outdoor recreation. This act allowed the fund that the LWCF earned to be distributed back into the recreation agencies to help the development of the program by the Bureau of Outdoor Recreation. This act provided a very broad authority from the U.S. Congress to charge entrance fees and use fees for recreation. Also this act required that states submit State Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation Plans (SCORPS) to the BOR before they could get LWCF grants. The BOR's Involvement in Alaska In the mid-1970s, the BOR was tasked with surveying various river systems in the state of Alaska, for potential nomination into the National Wild and Scenic Rivers program. The BOR provided oversight to teams that traveled to many river systems across the state, for the purpose of assessing the recreational value of these river systems. Each of these teams took detailed notes of their experiences on the river, noting wildlife observed, fishing opportunities, river mileage, gradient, terrain and vegetation, river hazards and other issues of interest to recreational boaters. In cases where multiple trips were taken to the same river, multiple sets of notes were taken. These notes were compiled into the Alaska River Logs, which are presently hosted on the Alaska Outdoors Supersite. The Alaska River Logs were subsequently compiled into a book, \\"The Alaska Paddling Guide\\", co-authored by Jack Mosby and David Dapkus, two BOR employees who were involved in the project. Eventually the following 25 rivers were selected for the National Wild and Scenic program: * Alagnak River * Alatna River * Andreafsky River * Aniakchak River * Beaver Creek * Birch Creek * Charley River * Chilikadrotna River * Delta River * Fortymile River * Gulkana River * Ivishak River * John River * Kobuk River * Koyukuk River (North Fork) * Mulchatna River * Noatak River * Nowitna River * Salmon River * Selawik River * Sheenjek River * Tinayguk River * Tlikakila River * Unalakleet River * Wind River State Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation Plans State Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation Plans (SCORP) were studies that the states prepared and submitted to the Bureau of Outdoor Recreation before they could qualify for LWCF grants. SCORP has raised awareness of outdoor recreation across the nation by having hundreds of scientists, who would not have normally been working on outdoor recreation projects, involved in the studies. Once studies about outdoor recreation began a ripple affect happened. Scientists at colleges and universities began doing more research going past the requirements for SCORP which then stimulated more people to outdoor recreation. Establishing Trails on Rights-of-Way, U.S. Department of Interior (undated) Government Printing Office Stock No. 2416-00052Rails-to-Trails The Bureau was one of the earliest federal agencies to become interested in the concept of converting abandoned railroad lines to trails for walking, bicycling, skiing and other recreational uses. In 1971 it published \\"Establishing Trails on Rights-of-Way,\\" a booklet that gave the rationale and explained the process for acquiring and developing these facilities; it also provided the public with a lengthy and intriguing list of rail corridors in every state that had been abandoned between 1960 and 1970. In 1977, under the authority of the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act, Congress gave BOR additional resources to further stimulate the creation of trails‚Äîthe Rails-to-Trails Demonstration Grant Program. That program ultimately helped establish nine of the earliest rail-trails, in California, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington. Area Classification Plan The Area Classification Plan used different types of lands to classify them as either *Class I: High-Density Recreation Areas *Class II: General Outdoor Recreation Areas *Class III: Natural Environment Areas *Class IV: Unique Natural Areas *Class V: Primitive Areas *Class VI: Historic and Cultural Sites This system was in place until the early 1980s, when the recreation opportunity spectrum system replaced it. Absorption In 1977 the Heritage Conservation and Recreation Service (HCRS) was created to enforce the New Heritage Program, and the service absorbed the responsibilities of the BOR. HCRS resulted from the consolidation of over 30 different laws and focused on the identification and protection of the nation's significant natural, cultural, and recreational resources. In 1981 HCRS was abolished as an agency; its responsibilities were transferred to the National Park Service. References Further reading * Roger L. Moore, B.L. Driver.

He was also the chosen physician of three prime ministers. He was knighted in 1918, made a baronet in 1923 and raised to the peerage in 1933. Biography Early life and education Thomas Jeeves Horder Thomas Jeeves Horder was born on 7 January 1871, the son of draper Albert Horder, in Shaftesbury, Dorset. Jeeves was his mother's maiden name. He was educated privately, and at the University of London and St Bartholomew's Hospital, London. Career Horder began his career at St Bartholomew's Hospital, where his first junior post was under Samuel Gee. When still quite young, Horder successfully made a difficult diagnosis on King Edward VII which made his reputation. In 1908 he was appointed as the first physician to the Cancer Hospital, later known as the Royal Marsden Hospital. His patients included every British monarch from Edward VII to Elizabeth II (except Edward VIII). They also included two prime ministers, Ramsay MacDonald and Bonar Law, and labour leader Hugh Gaitskell. He was involved in many official committees including advising the Ministry of Food during World War II. After the war he opposed many of Aneurin Bevan's plans for a national health service and may have helped modify some of those less palatable to the medical profession. He held the positions of Deputy Lieutenant County of Hampshire; Extra Physician to the Queen (formerly Extra Physician to King George VI); and Consulting Physician to St Bartholomew's Hospital (1912‚Äì1936). Knighted in 1918, he was created a Baronet in 1923. He was raised to the peerage as Baron Horder, of Ashford in the County of Southampton on 23 January 1933. Horder served as president of the British Eugenics Society from 1935 to 1949.Past presidents of the Galton Institute, Great Britain The Galton Institute, Great Britain, was formerly known as British Eugenics Society. He was president of the Cremation Society of Great Britain from 1940 to his death in 1955. He was president of The Peckham Experiment in 1949. Marriage and children In 1902 Horder married Geraldine Rose Doggett (1872‚Äì1954), of Newnham Manor, Hertfordshire, whose maternal grandfather was James Smith Rose of Arley House, Bristol, who in 1873 was the Mayor of Totnes. Their son was the publisher Mervyn Horder (1910‚Äì1997).

The JW3 campus sits on half an acre of land and includes the community centre/arts venue, an outdoor piazza and a tower block of apartments and offices. JW3 and the London Jewish Cultural Centre (LJCC) merged in March 2015, forming a single, enhanced organisation based at the JW3 site on Finchley Road. Organisation JW3's chief executive is Raymond Simonson, former Executive Director of Limmud, who succeeded Nick Viner. Marc Nohr is also the Chairman of JW3. JW3 is run by the Jewish Community Centre for London, a charitable organisation that aims to provide a way into, or back into, active Jewish life for all of London‚Äôs Jewish community. The organisation runs a wide programme of events that it launched in 2005. These target all members of the community, irrespective of affiliation or level of observance. Held in various venues across London, the programme aims to be inclusive and is not religious, instead using its events to provide a gateway into Jewish life and foster a cohesive community.  Events programme  JW3 runs a programme of social, cultural and educational events that mix audiences, age groups and content, encouraging experimentation with ideas and attempting to engage people in new issues. Previous arts and culture events have ranged from modern interpretations of art and music gigs (e.g. an Idan Raichel Project concert)Review: Idan Raichel Project / Noa to events such as Kvetch choir (the complaints choir) that encourages people to enjoy their own creativity and a singalong with the pensioner pop group \\"The Zimmers\\".Let‚Äôs hear it for the Zimmers singing My Generation, The Times Online Books-based events have included discussions on books related to the community, with guest author appearances, and debates on topics such as \\"Has the Left Lost its Way?\\". Social action events have included Mitzvah Day and an initiative in 2007 to bring Jewish and Muslim communities together. In November 2014 JW3 launched the first ever UK Jewish Comedy Festival, an annual festival celebrating the best in Jewish comedy. Guests have included Ruby Wax, David Baddiel and Stephen Tobolowsky. The gays In March 2017, JW3 ran a programme of LGBTQ+ related events to mark the 50th anniversary of the Sexual Offences Act (which effectively decriminalised homosexuality in England and Wales). This \\"GAYW3\\" programme caused a backlash from a number of rabbis of the Orthodox Jewish community, led by Rabbi Bassous. In July 2017, Rabbi Bassous issued a notice, signed by 6 other rabbis calling on their communities to distance themselves from JW3.

It was named after the 24-hour motorcycle endurance race at Le Mans in France. The Le Mans designation was first used for an 850 prototype, based on the V7, displayed at Premio Varrone in late 1972. The original 850 Le Mans was a caf√© racer with clip-on handlebars and a bikini nose fairing, but later models were developed as sports tourers with a three-quarter fairing. A marketing success,Walker, Mick, Moto Guzzi Twins Restoration, p. 20 the Le Mans competed against Italian superbikes from Ducati and Laverda. The Le Mans spawned several successor models, a final version appearing in the late 1990s. 850 Le Mans The Le Mans 850 caf√© racer, or Le Mans Mark I (never officially labelled Mark I), was first shown at the Milan motorcycle show in November 1975,Falloon, Ian, Moto Guzzi Sport & Le Mans Bible, p. 97 and sales began in 1976. Like the 750S and the 750 S3, the Le Mans 850 was developed from the 53 hpMotor Cycle News 4 Feb 2015 V7 Sport model of 1971, but power was increased to 71 hp. The power output measured at the back wheel was 71 bhp, giving a top speed of 130 mph. Compared to its roadster sibling, the T3, the Le Mans had higher-compression domed pistons, larger engine valves, and Dell'Orto 36 mm pumper carbs with filterless velocity stacks. The Mark I had two production runs with slight modifications. The first run, Series 1, had a round CEV taillight and continued until at least September, 1976,Classic Bike, October 2008, p50 but fewer than 2,000 of these were made. The Series 2 run totalled some 4,000 bikes and had these modifications: a De Tomaso-designed rectangular taillight, a modified rear mudguard, black fork sliders and a more generous dual seat. The seat was a one-piece item of injection-moulded foam. Most Le Mans 850 bikes were red and black, but a few were metallic blue (Ice Blue), and even fewer were white. Le Mans bikes gained a reputation for poor frame paint and rusting exhausts. Le Mans bikes exported to the United States had yellow side reflectors on CEV indicators, and a sealed-beam headlight as the OEM Aprilia headlight did not meet Department of Transport approval. These US sealed-beam units protruded in an ungainly way, spoiling the profile of the bike. 850 Le Mans II thumb The Mark II was similar to the Mark I, but the small 'bikini\\" fairing became a larger full fairing, in three parts, incorporating indicators. The fairing had been tested in Moto Guzzi's wind tunnel (which had been used to test race bike fairings in the 1950s).Falloon, Ian, Moto Guzzi Sport & Le Mans Bible, p75 The new fairing had a rectangular headlight, rather than the earlier round item. Cylinder bores were not coated with Moto Guzzi's patented \\"Nikasil\\" until later. Front suspension became air-assisted. The brake calipers on the front wheel, previously mounted on the front, were now mounted behind the forks. The dualseat was the same and could carry a pillion. Further changes included a revised instrument cluster derived from the 1000cc SP. Brakes were linked, with the handlebar lever operating the front right caliper and the footbrake operating both the front left and rear caliper. 850 Le Mans III The tank, seat, fairings were redesigned, and the instrument cluster was now dominated by a large white faced Veglia tachometer. An extensive technical re-design saw 80 changes from the Mk II model. Revised cylinder heads and barrels had a squared-off cooling-fin design. Pushrods were moved further from the bore centre, allowing for future increases in cylinder capacity. The engine had improved machining tolerances, revised carburation and exhaust systems, all of which gave an increase in power and torque. Minor changes were made to the rear suspension and to the front forks, with provision of linked air-assisted damping. Le Mans 1000 1984‚Äì1993 The Le Mans 1000 appeared at the end of 1984 and continued with minor modifications until 1993. The two main production runs were known as Series 1 and Series 2. The Le Mans 1000 had a 949 cc engine with uprated 40 mm pumper carbs and the B10 camshaft from the production racer. De Tomaso himself decreed a 16-inch front wheel and new Lario-styling for the Le Mans 1000Falloon, Ian, Moto Guzzi Sport & Le Mans Bible, pp. 97-104 Instead of redesigning the frame to incorporate a smaller front wheel, Guzzi simply fitted the smaller wheel into the existing frame (which was designed for an 18-inch wheel) without reconfiguring the geometry.Falloon, Ian, Moto Guzzi Sport & Le Mans Bible, p 99 Sturdier forks were fitted, as were smaller (270 mm) semi-floating front discs. The new bike was now physically much larger than the lean and low earlier Le Mans bikes, and performance was scarcely better than the Mark III predecessor. An 18-inch option became available in 1987. The Series 2 bikes included uprated Bitubo dampers and updated geometry. Most 1988 models were factory-fitted with the 18-inch wheel.Falloon, Ian, Moto Guzzi Sport & Le Mans Bible, p 104-6 Le Mans 1000 SE (Special Edition) 1986‚Äì1988 Released to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the V7's appearance the 1000 SE was sold in late 1986, 1987, and also into 1988 for those in the US market. (Only 100 SE models were sold in the US.) All 1000 SE bikes were red and white, with a red seat, red cast wheels and most had black rocker covers, engine and lower rails. Some had black engines and transmissions. The gearing was closer and higher than the standard 1000. Le Mans 1000CI 1988‚Äì1993 The 1000CI included many updates of the previous version and included a range of color schemes. The Series 3 is sometimes called the Le Mans 1000 Mark V NT (new type) and was to be the final incarnation of the line of Moto Guzzi Le Mans models.Falloon, Ian, Moto Guzzi Sport & Le Mans Bible, pp. 114-116 Racing A 1973 factory prototype finished 4th in the 24-hour race at Barcelona's Montju√Øc circuit.

Background The band were formed in 1969 and released their first album, Cochise, in 1970. The makeup of the band changed greatly before the recording of Swallow Tales as lead singer Stewart Brown was replaced by John Gilbert. Guitarist BJ Cole said that Gilbert's voice contrasted with the voice of Brown, as Gilbert sounded best on rock songs whereas Brown was more mellow.

The contemporary Boston Arts Festival is an annual event showcasing Boston's visual and performing arts community and promoting Boston's Open Studios program.Boston Office of the Mayor: Official Festival Site Accessed 2008-10-20City press release Accessed 2008-10-20 The weekend-long Festival at Christopher Columbus Waterfront Park features a wide variety of arts and high- end crafts, including painting, photography, ceramics, jewelry, sculpture and live music. The Arts Festival, which has existed in several different forms, was relaunched by former Mayor Thomas Menino in 2003, then reconceived by Mayor Martin J. Walsh in 2015. The Beacon Hill Art Walk and Artists Crossing Gallery will be organizing the 2019 September Festival. The original Festival, briefly named the \\"Boston Art Festival,\\" was held at Boston's Public Garden between 1952‚Äì1964. That version is credited with democratizing access to the fine arts in Boston, especially for young, emerging and often Jewish-American, artists who felt shut out of Boston's famously Brahmin museums and other institutional exhibition sites. Activist artists, either linked by the Boston Museum School or the Boris Mirski Gallery founded the Boston Arts Festival. The first Festival debuted on June 12, 1952, and displayed fine art in tents in the Public Garden, and provided free performances in nearby Boston Common. This represented a major break in how art was presented in New England. No longer confined to the monied and the elite, the early Festivals provided avant garde artists with a forum in which to show their work, compete and interact with one another. That exchange of ideas and influences developed into the earliest form of American Figurative Expressionism, known as Boston Expressionism.  History  The Boston Arts Festival had roots in 1940s' meetings organized to protest Boston's Institute of Contemporary Art, then known as the Institute of Modern Art. Artists like Hyman Bloom, Karl Zerbe, Ben Shahn, Jack Levine, Joyce Reopel, Mel Zabarsky and began gathering to discuss fears \\"that the Institute would ... become a showcase for ... something quite different that what we thought it ought to show and support,\\" Arthur Polonsky said later. Zerbe's experience with Boston's Museum of Fine Arts, which only \\"owned one watercolor, and at a time when his work was being acquired quite seriously, with pleasure, by some of the other institutions,\\" stoked those fears. The meetings jumpstarted the formation of the New England Chapter for Artist's Equity, an artist's union that advocated for more equitable commissions and representation. \\"[It was] really an Equity activity.\\" Arthur Polonsky said of the Boston Arts Festival in an oral history with the Archives of American Art. \\"It was taken up by a group of businessmen later, with the collaboration of artists and gallery people, and it became the first experimental Boston Arts Festival a year later, but preceding that, that year, I remember actually working on a station wagon at night, hauling paintings in from what was then the Copley Plaza out to the exhibit place. Equity had a booth of its own in the first Arts Festival ‚Äî six years of that ‚Äî simply giving out information on the organization.\\" In their work, the artists were, critic Adam Zucker writes, \\"inspired largely by political and/or social issues and conflicts.\\" Thus, the impetus behind the Festivals was not only political, but also identity-oriented. \\"Like German Expressionism, the American arts movement addresses issues at the heart of the expressionist sensibility, such as personal and group identity in the modern world, the role of the artist as a witness to issues such as violence and corruption, and the nature of the creative process and its implications.\\" In 1952, Boston's art world did not welcome outsiders, and few galleries exhibited their work. \\"Looking back to the 1950s there were few opportunities to see works by contemporary Boston artists in a museum setting.\\" Charles Guiliano writes. \\"Despite a young new director, Perry T. Rathbone (July 3, 1911 ‚Äì Jan. 15th, 2000), who was intent on making the Museum of Fine Arts more progressive that did not extend to embracing the dominantly Jewish Boston Expressionists. In the traditional Brahmin arts community there were elements of racism and anti Semitism....\\" \\"There was a dichotomy between the conservative, traditional painters of the venerable, Copley Society, and the more progressive artists,\\" Further, Guiliano notes, \\"[t]he more traditional and socially acceptable artists showed with the Copley Society or the Guild of Boston Artists. The work of Jews, immigrants or their sons, like the Lebanese/American Gibran, showed with gallerist Boris Mirski or his former assistants Hyman Swetzoff and Alan Fink of Alpha Gallery.\\" The inclusion of juried shows also provided a forum for artistic distinction that generated interest. \\"[T]here was palpable excitement visiting the annual Boston Arts Festival. In addition to exhibiting fine arts there was a stage for live performances,\\" Guiliano continues,\\" I recall jazz by the renowned Boston baritone sax player, Serge Chaloff, a play by William Saroyan, and a solo ballet performance by Maria Tallchief. The ambitious festival (1955-1962) organized by Nelson Aldrich ended through a lack of funding. An attempt to revive it decades later was embarrassed when the theft of a painting by Barney Rubenstein occurred because of a lack of security. There were prizes awarded by jurors of the BAF resulting in debates and controversy. This focused on a perceived dichotomy between traditional still life and landscape works and more progressive forms of abstraction. Visitors voted for a Popular Prize. In 1956 that was awarded to Kahlil Gibran for his memorable ‚ÄúSt. John the Baptist.‚Äù It stunned and amazed me. With then limited experience it was the greatest work of art I had seen. \\"...[I]t seemed like a good, exuberant, democratic, freeing kind of idea to many of us,\\" artist Arthur Polonsky said. \\"It was very hearty, the sensations among the artists of Boston in those festivals of the first years, certainly, and the public. And much was accomplished. People like Robert Frost and MacLeish had taken it all very seriously. Productions in opera, along with that fragile tent city of exhibitions went up each year.\\" Of prime importance to the artists was the fact that all of the events and exhibitions at the Boston Arts Festival were free of charge. This is a point the Guide to the Boston Arts Festival Records states repeatedly, while also noting the Festival eventually became cost prohibitive: \\"The first festival included a free program of painting, sculpture and music presented outdoors at the Boston Public Garden. Over the years, the Festival would expand upon this program by adding film, dance, and theater. The duration of the Festival was gradually increased as well. At various times, the selection process of the art shows and the perceived focus on modern arts attracted controversy, and the Festival often faced budget shortfalls due in part to the decision to allow free admittance to all performances while trying to provide quality programming on a large scale. Nonetheless, the Festival continued to operate with the goal of presenting a mass audience with a 'broad cross-section of the arts of our time [and arts] of as high an artistic standard as economically possible' until 1964.  The Revived Festival  Aerial View of Christopher Columbus Waterfront Park. Mayor Thomas M. Menino revived the Boston Arts Festival in 2003 as a one-day event, intended to launch Boston Open Studios and the 2003 performing arts season. The festival drew huge crowds to the newly re-designed Christopher Columbus Park on Boston‚Äôs Waterfront. Highlights of the event included lively performances by Boston Lyric Opera, performing Italian arias, La Pi√±ata presenting folkloric dance, the Mayor‚Äôs Mural Crew offering interactive mural painting and watercolor exercises, and reports from some visual artists of record-breaking sales. The Festival was expanded to two days in 2004, with highlight performances from Boston Ballet and Jazz Hip Hop Orchestra, and huge crowd attendance. In 2005, the Festival coincided with Boston‚Äôs 375th Birthday. To celebrate, some Festival performances were relocated downtown and to Faneuil Hall. Boston Ballet performed again alongside Chu Ling Dance and Haitian singer Gi Frants. The Festival drew record crowds in 2007, when juried artists exhibited and sold their artwork in a specially built artists‚Äô village. Opera Boston made their festival debut to great acclaim as did up-and-coming harpist Maeve Gilchrist on the new Garden Stage to complement the Waterfront Stage. Boston Pops Ensemble and the very popular Boston Gay Men's Chorus also made their debuts. The 2008 Festival, building on the success of the 2007 Festival, expanded to become a three-day event. Visual artists were now able to exhibit and sell their work on Friday while special guests Blue Man Group and Buffalo Tom entertained audiences from the Waterfront Stage. Despite the wettest day in the festival‚Äôs short history, large crowds turned out as the festival opened to great energy. The rest of the weekend brought better weather and a full entertainment program on two stages. An attendance record was set for the Festival on Saturday with an unprecedented turnout and individual artists reported record sales. Boston Children‚Äôs Museum provided activities for children alongside the Mayor‚Äôs Mural Crew. The Garden Stage played host to Pan United and harpist √Åine Minogue, amongst others, while on the Waterfront stage, the upcoming group Everyday Visuals shared billing with dance troupe OrigiNation, songwriter Bleu, and for the seventh year in a row, Boston Ballet.  Festival Reorganization  In 2015, Mayor Martin J. Walsh announced that the annual Boston Arts (Ahts) Festival would be re-imagined as Emerge, a one-day celebration of local arts and culture. That version of the Festival evolved over the next four years. Plans for the 2019 Festival note that it will be organized by \\"Beacon Hill Art Walk and Artists Crossing Gallery, and will launch Boston‚Äôs Arts Open Studios season featuring more than 70 juried local visual artists and craftspeople, plus local musicians performing on the Waterfront Stage throughout the day.\\"  References  Festivals in Boston Arts festivals in the United States Boston expressionism ","title":"Boston Arts Festival"},{"id":"19161796","text":"The Bolton Cricket League is a cricket league comprising twenty teams in and around Bolton, Greater Manchester in North West England.

After completion, it was a small, one-nave building, with a small apse. In western part of the nave, there was a gallery or choir loft and under the presbytery, there was a crypt, whose remains still can be found. The crypt was supported by four columns. At the beginning of the 13th century, a larger Collegiate Church of the Holy Trinity was built. It consisted of three naves, the outer two with side-chapels. The vault was supported by six pillars, and there were two towers on the western facade. It is probable that since the mid-12th century, the church was the center of a chapter, which was overseen by the bishops of Krak√≥w. However, the earliest remaining documents confirming the existence of the chapter come from the mid-13th century.  Gothic collegiate  The third and present church was built for King Casimir III.Nicola Coldstream, Medieval Architecture, page 196 It was one of several churches built by the ruler of Poland as atonement for his murder of the vicar of Wawel Cathedral, Marcin Baryczka. The collegiate church was damaged and then rebuilt several times. In 1598 its roof and clock were renewed, confessionals were added and a sculpture of the Madonna was replaced. In 1678, a general remodeling of the church was carried out at the expense of 6000 zlotys. Four years later, a hailstorm destroyed the roof. In the late 18th century, the village of Wi≈õlica became part of the Austrian Empire in the Partitions of Poland then, after the Napoleonic Wars, it was annexed by the Russian Empire until after World War I. In 1915, the church was seriously damaged by Austrian artillery during skirmishes with the Russian Army. The Western facade was destroyed, together with the 13th century towers. After the war, when Wi≈õlica became part of the Second Polish Republic, the damage was repaired with help of Professor Adolf Szyszko-Bohusz, a renowned architect of the Jagiellonian University. On September 7, 1924, the church regained the status of a collegiate church, which had been lost back in 1819.  Architecture  The church is made of stone, with the exception of the western facade which was destroyed in 1915 and rebuilt in brick. At the northern wall there is an annex, built in the second half of the 17th century, with a sacristy. In the anteroom, there is a characteristic portal and the door inside is adorned with a 15th-century rosette. Above the portal, there is a low relief commemorating King Casimir III and Jan Bodzanta, Bishop of Krak√≥w. It was funded in 1464, on the initiative of Jan D≈Çugosz, who in mid-15th century was a canon in Wi≈õlica. The Northern portal was built in the second half of the 14th century, with several eagles and coats of arms of Polish provinces. Nearby, there is a blind window, out of which, according to a legend, the Wi≈õlica Statutes were announced in 1347. The vault in the nave is partly ribbed, supported with three pillars. In several places on the vault there are coats of arms of parts of the Kingdom of Poland during the reign of Casimir III: Greater Poland, Ruthenia, Land of Sieradz, Land of Leczyca, and Dobrzy≈Ñ Land. There are also Evangelist symbols and the head of Jesus. In the presbytery, there are the remains of several post-Byzantine wall paintings, made by Master Hail, an Orthodox painter from Przemy≈õl between 1397 and 1400.Encyclopedia of Ukraine On the altar, there is a sculpture of the Madonna of ≈Åokietek, which dates to around 1300. According to legend, King Wladyslaw the Elbow-high prayed there for unity of the country. Also, Queen Jadwiga of Poland supposedly prayed there with her husband, King Jogaila. In the cellar of the church, there is a unique Romanesque figurative floor, with different persons and animals carved on it. The floor, which measures 4 by 2.5 meters, comes from around 1170 and was discovered in 1959. Near the church there is a small museum, which depicts Wi≈õlica's history as one of Poland's medieval settlements.New York Times, After Reaching Outward, Poland Looks Back to Its Roots  References   Further reading  * Michal Jurecki, Ponidzie.

It is about a writers' circle, on the night the chairman, Arnold, seems to wander into the imaginations of the other writers. Background Part of the inspiration for Improbable Fiction was reported to be a talk that Alan Ayckbourn once gave to a writers' circle, which he suspected was actually more of a social circle. The title was inspired by a quote from William Shakespeare's Twelfth Night: > \\"If this were played upon a stage now, I could condemn it as improbable > fiction.\\" ‚Äì Twelfth Night, Act III, scene 4 If the immediately preceding adult play, Private Fears in Public Places was notable for being the bleakest Ayckbourn play for many years, Improbable Fiction was notable for being the lightest, because in the few years previously, even the comedies had serious themes to them. It has been observed that this play has similarities with Ayckbourn's earlier family plays The Boy Who Fell into a Book and, to a lesser extent, My Very Own Story. Whether there was an intentional adaptation of these plays is unclear, but this was repeated the following year with If I Were You (argued to be derived from The Jollies). Whatever the reason for such a light play, it fitted in with the Stephen Joseph Theatre's 50th anniversary season, along with a revival of another Ayckbourn comedy, Time and Time Again. Characters There are seven characters in the play. They are: * Arnold, middle-aged chairman of the Writers' group and writer of instruction manuals * Grace, mother of grown-up children, wants to write children's books * Jess, a farmer, wants to write period romance novels * Vivi, younger woman, busy writing detective novels * Brevis, retired headmaster, still writing musicals * Clem, young man, writing conspiracy theory science fiction * Ilsa, carer for Arnold's mother during Writers' group meetings. In the second act, all the characters start playing various parts from various stories, apart from a confused Arnold who carries on being himself, whatever role is thrust on him by the story. Setting In contrast to Private Fears in Public Places and its 54 mini-scenes, Improbable Fiction used the single set of the living room in Arnold's house throughout the play, and one continuous scene, broken only by the interval. The first act almost entirely takes place during the Writers' Circle meeting. In the second act, however, the same room represents various houses in various stories in Victorian times, the 1930s, and the present day, with no set change other than changing the type of phone present on the dresser. The play was performed in- the-round for its original run at the Stephen Joseph Theatre in 2005. In the 2006 tour, it was adapted for the proscenium. Synopsis The play begins with Arnold anxiously setting up the chairs for a writers' circle meeting. First to arrive is Ilsa, a young girl whom Arnold hires to serve the tea. Ilsa also looks after Arnold's live-in bed-ridden mother, who periodically demands attention by banging a stick on the upstairs floor. She holds Arnold and the rest of the group in awe on the grounds that they are all writers, although Arnold himself, the only member of the group to have had something published, only writes instruction leaflets. When the rest of the group arrive, they all, over the first act, reveal what they are working on. Grace shows her illustrations for her children's story \\"Doblin the Goblin\\" (with friend Sid the Squirrel), Jess tells her of her vision for her period romance, Vivi explains how her latest detective novel is darker than the last three, Brevis plays a (somewhat tuneless) song \\"There's Light at the End of the Tunnel\\" from his musical adaptation of The Pilgrim's Progress, and Clem reads out an extract from his science fiction story (or, as Clem sees it, \\"science fact\\", with names changed to protect identities). All the writers have obvious weaknesses with their writing. Grace's children have long since grown up and her ideas would be confusing to the age this kind of story is aimed at. Jess never manages to start writing, whilst Vivi is clearly over-writing, and her description of the detective's smitten sidekick is obviously modelled on her and her search for the right man. Brevis's long list of successfully performed musicals can be attributed to the fact that he was a teacher at a school, and now that he is retired he is stuck. And Clem gets angry that no-one can follow his incomprehensible plot, and his persistent mispronunciation of words (such as \\"invulshable\\" instead of \\"invincible\\") drives Brevis up the wall. There is not much sign of the writers helping each other that much, and the group is still reeling from last week's visiting writer (if you can count someone who is only publicised on the internet as a writer), whose summary, in Arnold's words, was that \\"You should get the F-word on with it\\" (to which Brevis points out he finished with \\"you bunch of wankers.\\") When a nervous Ilsa enters and serves the tea painfully slowly, the rest of the group start making wild speculation about her. With the meeting over, the five writers go home, leaving just Ilsa, waiting for her boyfriend to pick her up on his motorbike. Suddenly, the lights go out, and Arnold sees Ilsa, in Victorian dress, walk towards him with a candle and a knife. The other five writers also surround him in Victorian dress. Ilsa screams, Arnold cries \\"Good Gracious!\\" and the first act ends. With the second act starting exactly where the first one left off, Arnold suddenly hears Jess narrating the story, somewhat in the style of Jane Austen or the Bront√´ sisters. Ilsa, it seems, has turned into an heiress who has seen some sort of ghost. But before this mystery can be solved, the room changes into that of a 1930s house, and a detective (Clem) and his assistant (Vivi, behaving very similar to the real Vivi) question Arnold about the murder of his wife, rather like a Poirot mystery. And then, before this is solved, Arnold finds himself confronted by a group of agents investigating the alien abduction of his mother-in-law (this time, with striking similarity to The X Files, Alien or The Matrix), with the leader (Brevis), mispronouncing all the long words exactly how Clem would want them. As Arnold flits back and forth through the stories, the first two mysteries are solved relatively easily. The ghost that the heiress/Ilsa saw, was, of course, just a model created by her scheming cousin (Clem) so that she could be declared insane and he could get the inheritance, but he gets rumbled. And so (or, as Jess narrates \\"And so, dear reader ...\\") this story ends. The murder's alibi in the 1930s is exposed when it is pointed out she did not have her glasses at the time, but not before the detective comes across a strange instruction manual in his pocket. Making the first kind comment ever to his sidekick (and Vivi says \\"Isn't he wonderful!\\") he leaves Arnold with the maid/Ilsa, who now seems to be his mistress. Ilsa advances on a bemused Arnold, but before she can have her way with him, he is back in the sci-fi story. The agents capture an alien pod and use it as trade. Whilst waiting, Brevis almost starts playing a song he wrote on the piano, but gets interrupted by the release of the captive. Suddenly, the alien pod starts to open to reveal ... Doblin the Goblin (Ilsa). A much more tuneful version of \\"There's Light at the End of the Tunnel\\" starts playing, Doblin sails down the river (the open alien pod now serving as Doblin's walnut-cum-boat), Sid the Squirrel follows, with all the rest in tow. And so Arnold is left alone again. He says \\"It's nice to finish with a song\\". The real Ilsa joins him ‚Äì evidently, whilst he spent an hour in other people's imaginations, for her it was just a moment in another room. It is clear that Arnold and Ilsa have a genuine friendship. Then, after Ilsa leaves, to prove it is back to reality, Arnold's mother bangs on the ceiling once more. He goes upstairs saying \\"It was a quiet evening really. Nothing unusual ...\\" Productions The original production at the Stephen Joseph Theatre had its first performance on 26 May 2005, and an opening night on 31 May 2005Plays at a glance (Scarborough) on official Ayckbourn website featuring the following cast: * Arnold: John Branwell * Grace: Eileen Battye * Jess: Becky Hindley * Vivi: Clare Swinburne * Brevis: Terence Booth * Clem: Giles New * Ilsa: Laura Doddington The production team were: * Director ‚Äì Alan Ayckbourn * Design ‚Äì Roger Glossop * Lighting ‚Äì James Farncombe * Costumes ‚Äì Pip Leckenby * Music ‚Äì John Pattison The production toured in 2006 with the same cast, except that Stuart Fox replaced Giles New as Clem. London, once again, was not included in the tour.Arts Archive, UK performance listings Since the Stephen Joseph production, there have been three further productions by other theatre companies, in Outer London, Hastings, Crawley and Cheltenham. Critical reviews Reviews of the production were divided, generally either broadly positive or broadly negative, with little in between. Much of the difference of opinion was down to what reviewers made of the change between the first and second acts. Amongst the positive reviews, Alfred Hickling of The Guardian wrote \\"... the second half provides a theatrical transformation of the magnitude only Ayckbourn can dream of.\\"The Guardian review, 2 June 2005 Charles Hutchinson of the Yorkshire Evening Press wrote: \\"Ayckbourn moves into the speeding, fantastical dimensions of his Christmas family shows, as stories in the style of each writer overlap, giving Ayckbourn the chance to send up Jane Austen, Dorothy L Sayers and The Matrix.\\" Yorkshire Evening Press review, 2 June 2005 However, the same second act that earned praise from some critics was criticised by Sam Marlowe, saying \\"The problem is that this parade of comic cardboard cut-outs is impossible to care about, so it's not long before it falls flat,\\" whilst arguing the earlier scenes worked better.The Times review, 2 June 2005 Charles Spencer, reviewing the show on its tour at Guildford, was harsher, suggesting this play was evidence of Ayckbourn's decline. He wrote: \\"Ultimately, it's the laziness that bothers me most about latter-day Ayckbourn. You don't feel he truly cares about his characters any more: indeed, at times he can't be bothered to get inside their heads at all.\\"The Daily Telegraph review, 25 January 2006 It was suggested that the reviews were generally better for the Scarborough production in the context of its 50th anniversary season, whilst expectations on the tour were for something deeper. Nonetheless, with three professional productions in the three years after the tour ended, Improbable Fiction has maintained a stage life outside of its original run. The play had its American premiere on 1 May 2009, at the Black River Playhouse, Chester, New Jersey, directed by Michael T. Mooney.

Plot Michele Abbagnano (Nino Manfredi) ekes out a living by abusively selling coffee, hot milk and cappuccino on the night trains running between Naples and Vallo della Lucania; each night, his goods held in a set of vacuum flasks which he carries in a basket along with handfuls of sugar packets he steals from railway caf√©s, he moves from carriage to carriage peddling warm drinks to the dazed, sleepy passengers. The need to maintain his young son (who suffers from a congenital heart deficiency) in an institution and the hope to amass a large enough sum to have him undergo surgery to make him healthy for good is more than enough to keep Michele in his awkward and exhausting line of business, to which, however, he's exceptionally suited. Keen of eye and wit he manages to befriend most of the passengers on the night trains, helping them with small favours (like waking them up before the stations they need to descend at) and telling tall tales centered on his right arm, which he keeps wrapped in a long leather glove pretending it to be wooden. Michele tailors the stories to the people he's telling them to...pretending of having been a successful pianist who had his career ruined to a young cross-eyed man pining about having been rejected from the Carabinieri, telling how he saved orphanage boys from a roaring fire to the nun leading some schoolboys, narrating how he lost the limb to freezing on the Eastern Front to the WW2 veteran and so on. During one night of 'work' Michele will be chased across the train by a trio of conductors who have been ordered by the Ministry of Transports to put an end to his activities once and for all; he'll meet his son (who has escaped from the institution) and will cross paths with a trio of petty thieves decided to enroll him as an accomplice in their misdeeds.

Mussey Jr. (often called RD Mussey) (May 30, 1833 - May 29, 1892) was a Union Army colonel during the American Civil War and a distinguished lawyer. He was an important recruiter of black men into the United States Colored Troops. Between April 1865 and November 1865, Mussey was President Andrew Johnson's private secretary. Johnson nominated Mussey for appointment to the brevet grade of brigadier general of volunteers, but the U.S. Senate did not confirm the appointment. Mussey was the husband of Ellen Spencer Mussey who was also his law partner and became the head of the practice upon his death. Early life Mussey was the son of the medical doctor Reuben D. Mussey and his wife Hettie Osgood. He was born in Hanover, New Hampshire on May 30, 1833.Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher, Civil War High Commands. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001. . p. 606 Some sources list his name as Reuben Delevan Mussey, suggesting that Jr. may not be technically correct, but since both he and his father are referred to as Reuben D. Mussey or Reuben Mussey, the Jr. is the best way to distinguish the two. After matriculating from Dummer Academy in Byfield, Massachusetts and attending Phillips Academy at Andover, Massachusetts, RD Mussey graduated from Dartmouth College in 1854. After College, he began teaching and working in the press in Boston. In 1859, he was the Washington correspondent of the Cincinnati Gazette. Civil War He campaigned for Abraham Lincoln in 1860 and was a leader in the Wide Awakes and at the outbreak of the Civil War joined a militia company led by abolitionist Cassius M. Clay which organized to guard the president and the White House. When the regular army was expanded in May 1861, he began serving in the regular army of the United States as captain of the 19th U.S. Infantry Regiment.Reunion of the Society of the Army of the Cumberland, Volume 23, 1892, Edited by Clarke, Robert. Mussey supported the anti-slavery movement and was in favor of the enlisting of black troops in the war.Cimprich, John. Book details, Slavery's End in Tennessee, 1861-1865 by John Cimprich, questia.com Mussey was a strong advocate of enlisting African-American soldiers and in correspondence with his superiors took issue with William T. Sherman's view on this issue.Smith, John David. Black Soldiers in Blue: African American Troops in the Civil War Era. University of North Carolina Press, 1 Aug 2004, p 231. As a captain of the 19th U.S. Infantry Regiment from May 14, 1861 until June 14, 1864, Mussey helped recruit African-American soldiers for the Union Army, being detailed to act as a commissioner for organizing black troops with headquarters at Nashville. On June 14, 1864, Mussey was appointed colonel of the 100th U.S. Colored Infantry. However, he remained in Nashville rather than serving with the regiment, instead continuing his organizational duties. After the war While in Nashville, he became connected with then governor and later President Andrew Johnson. Mussey served as President Johnson's private secretary from April 1865 to November 1865. At some date for which the record has not been found, Johnson nominated Mussey for appointment to the brevet grade of brigadier general in the regular army, to rank from March 13, 1865, but the U.S. Senate did not confirm the appointment.Mussey is shown on page 440 of Hunt, Roger D. and Jack R. Brown, Brevet Brigadier Generals in Blue. Gaithersburg, MD: Olde Soldier Books, Inc., 1990. , but no confirmation date is given and the Eicher's positively state that Mussey's appointment to rank from March 13, 1865 was not confirmed by the U.S. Senate. On the other hand, despite the Eichers statement that Reuben D. Mussey Jr. was not confirmed as a brevet brigadier general, other sources list him as a brevet brigadier general without reservation, including the relatively recent source of Hunt and Brown, 1990, p. 440. The Eichers cite Hunt and Brown but there is nothing in the Mussey entry in that book which supports their conclusion about Mussey's appointment not being confirmed and the editor of this footnote found nothing elsewhere in the Hunt and Brown book concerning Mussey. This means that it must be said that Mussey's full actual substantive rank was colonel and, pending the discovery of information from another definitive source, that there is a conflict in the sources as to whether or not his nomination as a brevet brigadier general ever was confirmed. Mussey was mustered out of the volunteers on December 26, 1865 and resigned from the regular army on February 19, 1866. Soon after this date, he began a law practice in Washington D.C. He had two daughters with his first wife. It was after her death he met and latter married Ellen Spencer. Mussey also served as an adjunct professor of law at Howard University. Reuben Delevan Mussey died in Washington, D.C. on May 29, 1892. He is buried in Oak Hill Cemetery (Washington, D.C.). Religiously, he was a member of The New Church Notes On Page 270 of Medical Record, Volume 1, edited by George Frederick Shrady, Thomas Lathrop Stedman.

He advocated and implemented close ties of the military to science for purposes of advanced weapons development. He was the head of the Army Ordnance Office, Senator of the Kaiser Wilhelm Society, first president of the Reich Research Council, the first general officer to be a member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences, as well as being a professor at both the University of Berlin and the Berlin Technical University. He was an early and key supporter of the development of ballistic rockets as weapons. The military-scientific infrastructure he helped implement supported the German nuclear energy program, known as the Uranium Club. Being depressed over heavy criticism from Hitler for shortfalls in munitions production, he committed suicide in 1940. He was given a State funeral. Career From 1898, Becker was a military engineer. From 1901 to 1903, Becker studied at the Munich Artillery and Engineering School. From 1906 to 1911, he studied at the Berlin Military Engineering Academy, specializing in ballistics under Carl Julius Cranz; from 1908 to 1911, he was a teaching assistant at the Ballistics Laboratory there. From 1911 to 1914, he was a member of the Artillery Examining Board. In 1913, Becker co-authored a revision of Cranz' classic text, Lehrbuch der Ballistik. During World War I, Becker held two positions. From 1914 to 1916, he commanded a 42-cm mortar battery. From 1917 to 1919, he was an advisor on artillery ballistics at the Weapons and Equipment Inspection (Inspektion f√ºr Waffen und Ger√§t), which later became the Heereswaffenamt (HWA, Army Ordnance Office).Document 75. E. Schumann: Armed Forces and Research p. 209, in . From 1919 to 1923, Becker studied chemistry and metallurgy. He was awarded a doctorate of engineering in 1922, with a thesis on cathodic change of phenol. From 1922, Major Becker was an advisor to the HWA inspections office. Becker was aware of the advantages of a close relationship between the military and science in the development of future weapons technology. As early as 1924, he recommended the establishment of a central laboratory of chemistry and physics. But only when he was director of the Ballistics and Ammunition Department of the Weapons and Equipment Inspection (Inspektion f√ºr Waffen und Ger√§t) was he able to implement his recommendation. The Central Office of Army Physics and Army Chemistry (Zentralstelle f√ºr Heeresphysik und Heereschemie) was formed in 1926 and recognized as an Armed Forces department in 1929. When Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933, this department took on greater importance and received generous funding from the Reich. Its Research Department established top- quality facilities, one of them was the Heeresversuchsanstalt (Armed Forces testing station) in Gottow; it was under the direction Kurt Diebner and played a central role in the German nuclear energy project, also known as the Uranverein (Uranium Club).Document 75.

Karl Becker, head of the ballistics and munitions section of the HWA Weapons Testing Division, was a key early supporter of Germany's development of the rocket as a weapon. In 1929, Becker got permission of the Reichswehrministerium (RWM, Reich Ministry of Defense) to do so. He was interested in the development of both solid-fuel and liquid-fuel rockets. Later, one of his subordinates, Walter Dornberger became important as leader of the V-2 rocket program. Wernher von Braun was hired in 1932.Michael J.

From 1932, Becker was an Honorary Professor of military sciences at the Friedrich- Wilhelms-Universit√§t (later, the Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin, i.e. University of Berlin). From autumn 1933, he was an ordentlicher Professor (ordinarius professor) of technical physics at the Technische Hochschule Berlin in Berlin Charlottenburg (later, the Technical University of Berlin). From 1935, he was ordentlicher Professor of defense technology, physics, and ballistics, as well as dean of the military engineering department (Wehrtechnische Fakult√§t), which had been newly created in 1933, at the Technische Hochschule Berlin. He was on the supervisory board of the Kaiser- Wilhelm Gesellschaft, the umbrella organization for numerous technical institutes.

Description Growing to a size of between 35 and 90 mm (excluding the tail), adults have a pattern of light brown, dark brown and white longitudinal stripes down their back. Below these are a series of narrow brown, black and white vertical stripes, which extend from the sides down to the stomach. The stomach is white with bright blue markings (males), and the rest of the underside is a deep pinkish-red hue. The tail changes from a brown color near the body with alternating rings of blue and black. The entire tail of juveniles and hatchlings is a bright blue color. It eats virtually any prey item, including berries, amphipods, moths, ants and small hermit crabs. Habitat The lizard is mainly found in beach areas and upland forest. Once indigenous to the island of St. Croix, the population was extirpated, likely due to habitat loss and the introduction of the Indian mongoose to the island in the 1880s. The lizard is found on four islands: Protestant Cay, Green Cay, Ruth Cay (a man-made island, constructed by dredging in the 1960s), and Buck Island. Eleven individuals were introduced to Ruth Island in 1990, and 57 individuals were introduced to Buck Island in 2008. Status The United States Fish and Wildlife Service listed the St. Croix ground lizard as endangered in 1977 (according to the Endangered Species Act of 1973), and Pholidoscelis polops is currently listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Efforts to save this species include two translocation projects to mongoose-free offshore islands around St. Croix. In 1990, ten lizards from the Protestant Cay population were placed onto Ruth Island. In 2008, fifty-seven lizards from the Green Cay population were placed onto Buck Island.

Over the years, she sailed the waters between Canada and the Caribbean, enabling students to learn navigation and nautical skills. She originally operated in the New England and Canadian waters during summer, and the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico in winter, making frequent stops in Bermuda during her transits north and south. During her time with Ocean Navigator Magazine, she carried six adult students and was crewed by a licensed captain and mate, a navigation instructor, two deckhands, and a cook. After an extensive refit in 1999, Ocean Star began training students and young adults on solely Caribbean waters. In 1999, she was bought by Seamester to host their college sail and scuba training programs. With Seamester, Ocean Star sails from her home port in Road Harbour, Tortola as far south as Grenada, with stops in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Saint Kitts, Martinique, Nevis, Saba, Sint Eustatius, Antigua, Dominica, Guadeloupe, Saint Lucia, and Saint Barthelemy.

It is considered to be one of the best selling Yugoslav records, and was ranked #46 on the list of Greatest Yugoslav Rock and Pop Music Albums.Antoniƒá, Du≈°ko - ≈†trbac, Danilo (1998) YU 100: najbolji albumi jugoslovenske rok i pop muzike,  History  Having finished the tour in support of Odbrana i poslednji dani album, the band started working on new material. Since Jugoton was unsatisfied with the sales of Odbrana i poslednji dani, the band had to take on a more commercial sound. In the meantime, bass guitarist Zdenko Kolar left to serve in the Yugoslav People's Army and was temporarily replaced by Branko Isakoviƒá. The band went to London and worked with producer Bob Painter who completely changed their style. The result was ƒåokolada. Originally planned to be released as a double EP entitled U gradu bez sna, at Jugoton's insistence it was released as a long-playing record. The album turned out to be the greatest commercial success the band had ever achieved. It sold roughly 350,000 copies which, with the Riblja ƒåorba album Mrtva priroda, made it one of the best-selling albums in Yugoslavia. The record was later overtaken by Plavi Orkestar and Bajaga i Instruktori. The album cover featured the girl from wrappers on \\"Seka\\" chocolates manufactured by Zveƒçevo from Slavonska Po≈æega. The album design was by the band members themselves with the help of Vladimir Galiƒá and the photographs were by Goranka Matiƒá. Most of the songs from the album were hits. The romantic \\"Bambina\\" and \\"Stranac u noƒái\\", a sentimental piano oriented ballad, were released as a promo single, but due to large popularity, later appeared for sale as well. A lot of funk elements are recognizable on the album, especially on \\"Soda boj\\" and \\"Udri bogata≈°a\\". The record also featured the ballads \\"U gradu bez sna\\" and \\"Tiho, tiho\\". Even though the record credited Neboj≈°a Krstiƒá, Srƒëan ≈†aper and Vlada Divljan as the writers of all the tracks, it is known that Divljan did not work much on the album as he was working on his university degree dissertation at the time. He wrote \\"Radostan dan\\", \\"Vetar i zastave\\" and \\"Ja sam tu\\" (partially containing lyrics from the song \\"Proplakat ƒáe zora\\" written by Drago Britviƒá, performed by Mi≈°o Kovaƒç on the festival Split 71). Guest appearances included the producer Bob Painter himself on synthesizer and Vivian Goldman on backing vocals. After the album's release, the band went on an enormously successful tour. The concert in Zagreb featured seven encore calls. However, due to differences within the band, they split up after the Ljubljana show.

It is bordered by Avenida Cuauht√©moc to the west, across from Belen Street to the north, Eje Central to the east and Eje 3 Sur Jos√© Pe√≥n Contreras to the south. History Generators at the Centro Cultural Estaci√≥n Indianilla. The neighborhood was planned by Francisco Lascur√°in in 1889, in an area called \\"La Indianilla\\". This name came from three indigenous women named Mar√≠a Clara, Mar√≠a Concepci√≥n and Mar√≠a Paula sold some of their land here to Father Domingo P√©rez Barcia to build a small chapel. However, Lascur√†in never followed through with his plans to construct the neighborhood. In 1895, The Mexican City Property Syndicate Limited proposed the plan to lay out the neighborhood anew, gaining approval of the Mexico City ayuntamiento. The major streets such as Ni√±os Heroes, Dr. Lavista, and Dr. R√≠o de la Loza were laid out. Originally the colonia was called \\"Hidalgo\\" but, as almost all of the streets here are named after famous physicians, the area became known as \\"Doctores,\\" leading to its current official name. In 1880, Ram√≥n Guzm√°n, owner of an enterprise of streetcars pulled by mules, established a yard there for the maintenance and storage of his vehicles. Today the Procuradur√≠a de Justicia del D.F. (Court house of the Federal District) is located in its place. A couple of decades later, a large part of this area was owned by the Compa√±√≠a de Tranv√≠as, also known as the Mexican Electric Transway, serving as a trainyard as well as housing workshops for the maintenance and repair of rail cars. This service began in 1900. Train engineers, who worked all hours, gave rise to vendors selling food, especially chicken soup (\\"caldo de pollo\\") in the late night and early morning hours. This tradition remains and the area is noted for its soup. Sites of interest Hospital General de M√©xico, located on Dr. Balmis street near Avenida Cuauht√©moc and Metro Hospital General. General Hospital of Mexico The General Hospital of Mexico (Hospital General de Mexico) was inaugurated on 5 February 1905 and covers seventeen hectares. Today, the hospital employs 6,000 professionals including doctors, nurses, technicians, paramedics and administrators. Each day, the hospital treats 3,000 outpatients, discharges about 112 inpatients, and performs 164 surgeries and other invasive procedures. It has 39 medical specialties in treatment, diagnostics and rehabilitation, providing care at the secondary and tertiary level. The hospital also receives each year 1,163 medical students and 447 residents as well as 1,624 nursing students and other paramedical trainees. It is also a research hospital with 70 investigators, 27 percent of whom are members of Mexico's National System of Researchers (SNI), publishing about 158 articles each year. Arena M√©xico Doctores is home of \\"Arena M√©xico,\\" considered the \\"cathedral\\" of lucha libre, a style of professional wrestling. The arena hosts wrestling four days a week, on Sunday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday. Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre, the oldest professional wrestling promotion in the world, along with sister promotion Lucha Libre Elite, are the current tenants of the Arena M√©xico.

It has murals by Ra√∫l Anguiano and glasswork by Revueltas. Escuela Libre de Derecho (Free School of Law) View of the Escuela Libre de Derecho from Dr. R√≠o de la Loza Street. Located on Dr. V√©rtiz 12, on the corner of Arcos de Bel√©n, it is one of the most prestigious law schools in Mexico, and second only to UNAM in age. It was founded 14 July 1912, during a time when Mexico was in political turmoil, including student unrest against the regime of President Porfirio D√≠az. It offers degrees at both the bachelor's and master's levels for those seeking careers as lawyers and other aspects of juridical science. Porfirio D√≠az mansion. Porfirio D√≠az mansion On Doctor Jim√©nez street, is an old mansion that was a wedding gift for Porfirio D√≠az and his new wife do√±a Carmen Romero Rubio. They first used the house as a getaway as this area was just on the outskirts of the city at the time. In 1904, they decided to convert it into an educational center for working mothers and their children, known as the \\"Casa Amiga de la Obrera\\" (Friends House of the Working Woman). It is now the Escuela de Participaci√≥n Social No. 1 (Social Participation School No. 1) primary school affiliated with UNESCO. Centro Cultural Estaci√≥n Indianilla. Centro Cultural Estaci√≥n Indianilla The Centro Cultural Estaci√≥n Indianilla is located on Claudio Bernard Street in the colonia. This cultural center was opened in 2006 in what was an old workshop for the reparation of tram cars. The building had been in disrepair for a number of decades. It now houses exhibition space for modern and \\"alternative\\" art, taking advantage of the buildings tall ceilings and rooms built to accommodate railcars. In its basement, is the Frida de Juguete Arte Objeto Museum with pieces from artists such as Alberto Castro Le√±ero, √Ångel Ferm√≠n Vizuet, Francisco Toledo, Gustavo P√©rez, Irma Palacios, Jazz Moart and Joe Laville. Centro M√©dico Siglo XXI (IMSS) (21st Century Medical Center-IMSS) This facility was inaugurated in 1964, becoming the most important center for specialized medicine in the country. It is located on Cuauht√©moc Avenue in the far southwest corner of the colonia. The hospital houses about 30 works of art from fourteen different artists such as David Alfaro Siqueiros, Federico Cant√∫, Luis Nishizawa, Francisco Z√∫√±iga, Jos√© Ch√°vez Morado, Salvador Pinoncelly and Tosia Malamud. The 1985 Mexico City earthquake damaged many of the buildings' foundations requiring demolitions but their artworks were salvaged. The center sees the art as an integral part of the healing process. Inside the main entrance of the hospital is a mural called \\"Homage to rescue\\" by Jos√© Ch√°vez Morado. It is 230 square meters etched in marble done between 1988 and 1999. Government buildings This area, especially the northern section, is home to a number of Mexico City's governmental offices, including: *Procuradur√≠a General de Justicia del Distrito Federal, on Gabriel Hern√°ndez Street. *Asesor√≠a Jur√≠dica Laboral, on Dr. Lucio St. *Comisi√≥n de Derechos Humanos del Distrito Federal, on Doctor R√≠o de la Loza St. *Instituto Electoral del Distrito Federal, on Orozco y Berra St. *Fondo de Seguridad P√∫blica del D.F., on Gabriel Hern√°ndez St. *Fondo para la Atenci√≥n y Apoyo a las Victimas del Delito, on Gabriel Hern√°ndez St. *Instituto de Formaci√≥n Profesional del D.F., on Gabriel Hern√°ndez St. *Sistema de Corredores de Transporte P√∫blico de Pasajeros del Distrito Federal (Metrob√∫s), on Av. Cuauht√©moc. Crime and public safety The area has a reputation of being high crime. It was ranked among the top 25 neighborhoods of the city for percentage of residents incarcerated, and it was ranked fourth most ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù neighborhood based on the total number of reported crimes per day (not calculated per capita), behind Centro, Colonia del Valle, and Colonia Narvarte. It is also known for its large numbers of cantinas, cabarets and ‚Äúhotels de paso‚Äù (hotels with hourly rates). However, most of the crime associated with this area is related to car theft and chop shops. For example, a Hummer stolen from El Paso, Texas, was recently found intact on the streets here. Colonia Doctores used to be the home to many pulquer√≠as, bars or cantinas that serve pulque to a mostly lower-class clientele. However, in Mexico City, these establishments have been heavily regulated because they were often seen as centers of vice. Due to this, and the increasing popularity of beer, very few pulquer√≠as still exist; a remaining example is \\"La Hija de los Apaches\\" at Dr. Lavista 186.

Design and history The Germans were desperate for long-range artillery in the early part of World War I and resorted to mounting naval guns on wheeled carriages as well as rail cars. The wheeled carriages were less than successful due to their great weight, but the rail-mounted guns rather more so. All of the naval guns received nicknames and were crewed by sailors. The 15 cm guns were called \\"Nathan\\", \\"Nathan Ernst\\" and \\"Nathan Emil\\" although the reason for three different names isn't known for certain. Quite probably they were used to differentiate between models of the 15 cm gun as both the C/13 and the C/16 guns are known to have been used. The latter guns were originally intended for the canceled s then under construction while the former were spare guns for dreadnoughts and older light cruisers. At any rate the 15 cm guns were mounted in a well-base flatcar with two four-wheel bogies. No outriggers were fitted so the recoil energy from shots fired perpendicular to the railroad track could rock the flatcar significantly even with it chained to the ground. They were fitted with front and side gunshields, although, oddly enough, no overhead armor was fitted. They first saw service in 1918 and appear to have been mainly used for coastal defense duties. It fired naval Spgr. L/5 (Haube) HE shells weighing with of explosive filler.Fran√ßois, p. 41 It used the German naval system of ammunition where the base charge was held in a metallic cartridge case and supplemented by another charge in a silk bag which was rammed first. The same gun was used for coast defense duties in concrete emplacements after World War I as the 15 cm SK L/45. References Notes Bibliography * Fran√ßois, Guy.

Hurston was a relative newcomer on the literary scene when this short story was published, but eventually had greater success with her highly acclaimed novel, Their Eyes Were Watching God. \\"The Gilded Six-Bits\\" is now published in Hurston's compilation of short stories entitled Spunk in which it is now considered one of her best stories. \\"The Gilded Six-Bits\\" is a story full of love, betrayal, and forgiveness. It portrays the life of two happy newlyweds who both test their relationship and their love for one another when a charismatic outsider comes into their community and into their home. The story embodies Hurston's typical writing style in which it focuses on the common African-American lifestyle, represented by regional dialect and metaphors, and is set in her native town Eatonville, FL where it reflects the traditions of the community. \\"The Gilded Six-Bits\\" symbolizes the meaning of a true marriage and the truth that lies underneath its meaning. Plot summary \\"The Gilded Six-Bits\\" opens with the description of a house, surrounded by what is described as \\"a Negro yard around a Negro house in a Negro settlement. But there was something happy about that place.\\" The characters are first introduced when Missie May awaits her husband, Joe, who is returning from work on a pay day, where he comes home and tosses silver dollars through the front door for Missie May to pick up. Like always, she pretends to be mad that he is throwing the money and playfully chases him, then goes through his pockets to find a little present that he has bought her. That night, with the silver dollars placed next to Missie May's plate during dinner, Joe tells her that he is going to take her out to a new ice cream parlor opened by a new rich black man in town from Chicago, who goes by the name of Otis D. Slemmons. To many people in the community, Slemmons is seen as a charismatic and wealthy black man. Joe discusses Mr. Slemmons' fine clothes, all the while Missie May seems to be unimpressed, suggesting that he might be lying about his wealth and success, and stated \\"Aw, he don't look no better in his clothes than you do in yourn. He got a puzzlegut on 'im and he so chickle-headed, he got a pone behind his neck,\\" which is implying that there is no other man that can be better nor look better than Joe. Joe still believes that Slemmons is still a great man and decides to take Missie May to the ice cream parlor so he can show his beautiful wife off in hopes of meeting Mr. Slemmons. At the ice cream parlor, Missie May still shows that she is not impressed by the man but shows some keen interest in his wealth. After returning home Joe tells Missie May that although he may not have money like Slemmons, he'd rather be broke as long as he has her. Every week, they make their visit to the ice cream parlor. It's not until one night that Joe gets off work early the test of love is finally revealed. Joe arrives home to find Slemmons in the bed alongside Missie May. Missie May pleads and apologizes to Joe by revealing that the only reason she slept with Slemmons was to get money from him. Joe shows anger by attacking Slemmons, but after he leaves he shows no more signs of anger. The next morning, Joe treats the day as if it was just an ordinary day and asks Missie May why she is not eating breakfast. Missie May cannot understand why Joe does not leave her, but he continues to torture her by carrying around the golden coin Slemmons left behind to symbolize the affair. Days go by and the couple slowly drifts away until Joe comes home complaining of aches and pains. He asks Missie May to give him a massage and that night they end up sleeping together for the first time in a long time. When Joe gets up that morning, he leaves behind Slemmons' coin, in his attempt to torture her, by paying her for her services. When Missie May examines the coin, she realizes that it is nothing but a gilded half dollar. She realizes that Slemmons was not a rich man after all, but a liar and a fake. At that point, Missie May feels ashamed and embarrassed by throwing all of the happiness away for something that seemed too good to be true. A few weeks after this event, Missie May finds out that she is pregnant and Joe is not concerned whether the baby is his or not. Fortunately at the end of the story, the baby is born, and after some convincing by his mother, Joe accepts the baby as his. Joe is truly happy and takes the gilded coin to the candy shop to buy his wife some chocolates. That night when he returns home, he continues the tradition between the two, by tossing the silver half dollars to Missie May to symbolize the happiness that is again within the house, and for the first time in a while, they are finally a happy couple again. Themes, influences, and symbols \\"The Gilded Six- Bits:\\" The short story was coincidentally published the year the United States went off the gold standard and Franklin D. Roosevelt asked loyal Americans to exchange their gold for silver and paper money. This type of money had significance in the story in which it personifies the character, Otis D. Slemmons as having gold money and symbolizes him being known as a counterfeit. Appearance vs. reality: Hurston dramatizes this theme by portraying that objects are covered to make them better than they are, which can be seen with the gilded half-dollar. Also, people are seen as two faced, which can be seen by both Otis D. Slemmons and Missie May. Marriage is also a disguised form of prostitution, the flexible use of language makes communication impossible, and the double meaning of words functions as the representation of fraud as seen by the six bits. Biblical allusions: In Hosea 1:2, considering the story of Hosea, it is found that the prophet commanded to \\"marry an adulterous wife\\" as it can be compared to Hosea and Joe with Gomer and Missie May. As it can be understood, at the end of the story when Joe's mother explains that she never thought he would end up with Missie May because she was liable to go astray as it can be understood with her affair with Slemmons. This can be compared with Hosea and Gomer because Gomer was an adulterous wife and did not remain faithful to her husband. Just as Joe threw silver coins in the house to Missie May, with fifteen shekels and some barley, Hosea attempts to buy back his wife. Also, after the night of the affair, at breakfast Joe tells Missie May she cries too much. He compares her to Lot's wife. He states, \\"Don't look back lak Lot's wife and turn to salt.\\" Influences from Hurston's own life: Hurston was married and divorced twice. Her rocky marriage occurred just prior to the writing of \\"The Gilded Six-Bits\\", which portrays a marriage tested by infidelity. In the story, Missie May's infidelity tests the strength of the marriage with Joe, a marriage which ultimately surpasses its weaknesses. The marriage is spared because, despite Hurston's hardships in her own marriages, she saw marriage as an important foundation capable of providing possibilities in life. \\"The Gilded Six-Bits\\" was influenced by her educational endeavors in anthropology and her unsuccessful marriage with Herbert Sheen. Film The movie of The Gilded Six-Bits is based on the actual story of a happy couple whose life is disrupted when a fancy hustler played by Wendell Pierce comes to town enticing Missie May played by T'Keyah Crystal Keymah with the promise of gold. Novella Nelson also stars as Mama Banks, Joe's (Chad Coleman) cautious mother. The film aired on the Showtime cable network in February 2001 and was directed by Booker T. Mattison.

The music was performed by the Michael Nyman Band, recorded live in one take and ending in applause at Riverside Studios and edited for the album by William Furlong, Audio Arts' editor-in-chief. The artwork is a four-part theatre work that \\"deals with the consequences after the unveiling of the ultimate architectural masterwork, a 'model' for society.\\"Liner notes. All quotations are from this source unless otherwise specified. The four parts of the work are dance, dramatics, gymnastics, and contemporary sound, including music, dialogue, and noises, with each discipline utilized in a way to emphasize its unique qualities. The first side of the album is the dialogue sculpture for four voices reducing to one. There are many voices, male and female, as many as four at once, none of whom are identified, but one is Michael Nyman. The voices comment on architecture, social class, welfare, Jimmy Carter, and the nature of art, among other things, often as arrogant or loud and powerful characters. There are complaints about 'The Masterwork,' particularly by a workaday architect who does not consider himself \\"slashed\\" with multiple disciplines.

Tropical Storm One (1B) The first storm of the season began its life on October 10 in the Bay of Bengal. It executed an anticyclonic loop to the west, and became a tropical storm before hitting eastern Sri Lanka on the 17th. It continued westward, and ultimately dissipated over the Arabian Sea on the 20th. Unknown Two (2B) On October 18, a storm of unknown intensity hit eastern India, dissipating the next day. Tropical Storm Three (3A) The monsoon trough spawned a tropical depression off the western Indian coast on November 12. It tracked generally northwestward, slowly organizing into a tropical storm on the 17th. The storm turned to the northeast, where it dissipated over the northeastern Arabian Sea. Tropical Storm Four (4B) A storm of unknown intensity persisted in the western Bay of Bengal from December 3 to the 7th, remaining well offshore of any landmass. Tropical Storm Five (5B) The last storm of the season formed in the central Bay of Bengal on December 12. It moved east-southeastward, then turned to the west where it briefly became a tropical storm. The storm struck eastern Sri Lanka, and dissipated over the island on the 17th.

Playing career Early career Simpson was born in Glasgow and as a youth played for Benburb before joining Wolverhampton Wanderers in January 1947. He only made two First Division appearances for the Wolves before moving to Third Division (South) Notts County in October 1949. He made 76 appearances for Notts County between 1949 and 1952, scoring on seven occasions and he also collected a Championship medal in 1950. Southampton In November 1952, he was transferred to Second Division Southampton, with Jack Edwards moving to Meadow Lane. According to Holley & Chalk, he \\"had an excellent temperament\\" and was made club captain soon after his arrival. On 28 February 1953, he broke an ankle playing at Brentford. Saints had spent most of the season in the relegation zone, but Simpson's replacement, former club captain Stan Clements was not able to lead the team to safety and they dropped to the Third Division (South) for the first time since 1922. Simpson recovered in time for the start of the next season, but in October he lost his place to newly arrived Robert McLaughlin. Simpson regained his place for five matches at the end of the season, and in 1954-55 he was initially ever-present, scoring his only goal for the Saints with a header against Reading at The Dell on 2 October 1954. Whilst scoring the goal, he was knocked unconscious, but recovered in time for the next match. In mid-March, he was replaced by Bryn Elliott and in the summer of 1955 he was offered a free transfer. In his three years with the Saints, he made a total of 75 appearances, scoring once. Later career In June 1955, he was transferred to fellow Third Division South side Shrewsbury Town, where he continued to give good service, making over 100 appearances in three years. He then returned to the Wolverhampton area, where he joined the family fish and chips business, turning out occasionally for Nuneaton Borough.

He died before the building was finished, and it was completed by his daughter, Jeanne, in 1508.Carr√© de Busserolle, loc. cit.; Several owners succeeded to the estate, but none brought major transformations to the castle. According to terms of a sale contract dated 28 June 1715 between Georges-Fran√ßois de Gu√©nand, seigneur de l'√âtang and Pierre Anguille de la Niverdi√®re, the land consisted of a ch√¢teau-fort,Carr√© de Busserolle, loc. cit.. enclosed walls, ditches, drawbridge, barns, gardens, orchards, vines, mature wood of standing timbers and coppice, wild rabbits, and many other things. On 24 June 1853, Santiago Drake del Castillo, heir of a wealthy plantation owner, acquired the castle. At this time the northern wing was added, in the neo-gothic style; this tripled the living space. M. Drake del Castllo also founded a free school for some sixty young girls, in the valley between the ch√¢teau and the railway right-of-way.Carr√© de Busserolle, loc. cit.. Charles E. Bedaux and the royal wedding In 1927, Charles Bedaux, a Franco-American industrial millionaire, and his wife Fern, purchased the castle from Jean Drake del Castillo, the grandson of Santiago. They carried out substantial work to modernise the castle, such as adding a plumbing system, improving the electrical system and installing central heating in all parts of the building, with 60 tons of pipes installed in the walls. The eight bedrooms are each equipped with a bathroom in the art d√©co style; all have baths equipped with an American system, making it possible to fill and empty a bathtub in less than one minute. Indoor toilets were also added. Bedaux installed a telephone, which at the time was unique in a French residence; it was directly connected to the exchange in Tours, and therefore required an operator to be present in the castle. A golf course with 18 holes, a tennis court, a gymnasium and a solarium were also built at this time. In 1937, the marriage of the Duke of Windsor (formerly King Edward VIII), and Wallis Simpson took place here.Howarth, Patrick (1987). George VI. (Hutchinson), p.73; Cecil Beaton took their wedding photos here as well. On the death of Fern Bedaux in 1972, the castle was bequeathed to the State, which reassigned it to the council of Indre-et-Loire in 1974.

The channel was created in 2000 when it replaced the Pan-European version of Cartoon Network in the region. History Cartoon Network was launched in 1993 across Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and was originally twinned with movie channel TNT (later TCM) in a pan-European version. Cartoon Network ran from 6:00am until 8:00pm CET, with TNT taking over from 8:00pm to 6:00am CET. Some programs on the pan-European feed were dubbed into Norwegian, Swedish and Danish, dubbed locally by companies such as SDI Media Denmark and Dubberman Denmark, for the Danish soundtrack. On December 16, 1996, Cartoon Network became a 24/7 channel, as did TNT. However, a version of the channel called TNT & Cartoon Network continued to appear on some providers in Europe. In 2000, a regional Scandinavian version of Cartoon Network was created, broadcasting in Danish, Swedish and Norwegian. In mid-May 2006, the channel rebranded to the City era, with the logo, promos, bumpers and idents altered as well. The Boomerang block was removed but most of its program content still continued to be offered on the channel. In mid-May 2009, the branding was changed to the Arrow era as seen on other CN feeds in the EMEA region at the time. In early 2011, the channel rebranded to the Check It 1.0 era, with a new logo, bumpers and idents influenced by the Checkerboard era. From October 1, 2012 onwards, there are local Swedish commercials on the Swedish subfeed's ad breaks as opposed to the pan-Nordic commercials aired in Denmark, Norway, Finland and Iceland. Since November 1, 2013, Cartoon Network has been broadcasting in widescreen. Although the channel airs 24/7, some distributors only broadcast the channel between 6:00am and 9:00pm, with Turner Classic Movies filling the remainder of the schedule. Distributors that only broadcast the partial version include Viasat, Telia Digital-tv and many smaller analogue cable systems. The channel is not yet available in Finnish in Finland, but some of the programs on the channel are available in Finnish on local Finnish channels such as MTV3, C More Juniori, Sub and Nelonen. In November 2014, the channel rebranded to Check It 3.0, following various other EMEA feeds doing so. On April 2, 2016 Cartoon Network Nordic rebranded to the Check It 4.0 graphics package, marking the first major stage towards the rebrand rollout across the EMEA region. Programming blocks Cartoon Network Classics Mainly shows Cartoon Cartoons, along with other programming dropped from the main schedule. It airs at 2:00am CET, to 4:00am CET. The block is not advertised, and does not have any special bumpers. It also lacks commercials. Toonami Similarly to its American and British counterparts, the Toonami block mainly showcased action-oriented cartoons. However, not much anime was shown, and Toonami Nordic was more focused on non-Japanese action cartoons. Shows that were shown included Samurai Jack, Batman of the Future, X-Men: Evolution, The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest, Justice League, Beyblade and Megas XLR. Boomerang When it existed, the Boomerang block on CN Nordic would usually air older content, such as Looney Tunes, Merrie Melodies, Tom and Jerry and various Hanna‚ÄìBarbera cartoons. When it was removed, its content was spread around the schedule, but over the years the shows have either been removed or moved to Boomerang instead.  My CN  A block also featured on CN UK, My CN, which existed throughout the Arrow era on CN Nordic, aired every weekend, giving the viewers a chance to vote for one of two different shows via the network's website. The show with the most votes would air on weekends at 8:10am CET. The show also gave viewers the chance to become the host regardless of nationality. Also, if for example a Swedish viewer was chosen as a host, their voice would be dubbed into Danish and Norwegian for the respective soundtracks, and if for example a Finnish or Icelandic viewer was chosen to be a host, their voice would be dubbed into Danish, Swedish and Norwegian.

The Yucatec way has its counterparts among other Maya groups. In Tzotzil ethnography, the way (here called wayihel or chanulCalvin 1997: 870Pitt-Rivers 1970: 186) is more often an animal companion and refers not only to domestic animals, but also to igneous powers such as meteor and lightning. In Tzeltal Cancuc, the nagual animal companion is considered a 'caster of disease'.Villa Rojas 1947: 584 Other names found are: Lab, labil, wayixelal or vayijelal, way and wayxel or wayjel.Diccionario Multilingue Svanal Bats'i K'opetik Siglo xxi editores argentina, S.A. 2005 p 175  In the Classic Period  Jaguar way with scarf A Classic Maya hieroglyph is read as way (wa-ya) by Houston and Stuart. These authors assert that a glyph representing a stylised, frontal 'Ahau' (Ajaw) face half covered by a jaguar- pelt represents the way, with syllabic wa and ya elements attached to the main sign clarifying its meaning.Houston and Stuart 1989 Many way animals are distinguished by (i) a shoulder cape or scarf tied in front; (ii) a splashing of jaguar spots or other jaguar characteristics; (iii) the attribute of an upturned 'jar of darkness'; and (iv) fire elements.See figures in Robicsek and Hales 1981: 28‚Äì34 The Classic wayob include a far wider array of shapes than the 20th-century ones from Yucat√°n (insofar as the latter have been reported), with specific names assigned to each of them. They include not only many mammals (especially jaguars) and birds, but also apparitions and spooks: hybrids of deer and spider monkey, walking skeletons, a self-decapitating man, a young man within a fire, etc.Grube and Nahm 1994 The animal wayob are likely to be transformative shapes of human beings, the walking skeletons (Maya Death Gods) more particularly of the ah uaay xibalba transformers. At times, the name of the way is followed by an 'emblem glyph' giving the name of a specific Maya kingdom (or perhaps its ruling family).Freidel et al. 1993: 191‚Äì2.

(Called the Evening Star prior to 1899, the Toronto Daily Star is now known simply as the Toronto Star.) \\"I have very fond memories of the Toronto Star,\\" Shuster told Star reporter Henry Mietkiewicz for a story that ran on April 26, 1992, three months before Shuster died in Los Angeles. \\"I still remember drawing one of the earliest panels that showed the newspaper building. We needed a name, and I spontaneously remembered the Toronto Star. So that's the way I lettered it. I decided to do it that way on the spur of the moment, because the Star was such a great influence on my life.\\" Golden Age When Superman first appeared in comics, in June 1938's Action Comics #1, his alter ego, Clark Kent, worked for the \\"large metropolitan daily\\" newspaper (Action #7, Dec 1938) the Daily Star under editor George Taylor (Superman #2, Fall 1939). With the exception of Action Comics #2, when Kent (and Taylor) inexplicably worked for the Cleveland Evening News, the above arrangement remained unchanged through March 1940 (Action #22). Kent apparently had persuaded Taylor to hire him only shortly before the first issue of Action by phoning in an exclusive account of Superman's first public act‚Äîthwarting an attempted lynching at the county jail (Superman #1, Summer 1939). Before long, Kent was referred to as the paper's \\"ace scribe\\" (Action #9, Feb 1939) and \\"ace reporter\\" (Action #6, Nov 1938). He often butted heads with Lois Lane, an aggressive, career-minded journalist who'd started as the Daily Star's \\"sob sister\\" (Action #7, Dec 1938) and \\"lovelorn editor\\" before earning her stripes as a full-fledged \\"news reporter\\" (Superman #3, Winter 1940) and war correspondent in Europe (Action #22, Mar 1940). Then, in Spring 1940 (Action #23), without any in-story explanation, the newspaper suddenly was referred to as the Daily Planet, an especially amusing development for Kent and Lane, who were abroad and in the midst of a multi-issue storyline when their place of employment changed names (the alteration had been made earlier in the newspaper comic strip, with Nov 13, 1939's #259). In reality, the fictional newspaper's name was changed to avoid a name conflict with actual papers that had \\"Star\\" in their titles. In the monthly comic titled, Superman, the newspaper was the Daily Star until it was changed, also without fanfare, to the Daily Planet in Superman #4 (Spring 1940). George Taylor remained the editor (Action #25, June '40) through November 1940 (Action #30), after which new Daily Planet editor Perry White inexplicably appeared (Superman #7, November‚ÄìDecember 1940). Kent and Lane made no reference to the management change, though they clearly were not as enamored of White as they'd been of Taylor. Silver and Bronze Ages When DC Comics made use of its multiverse means of continuity tracking between the early 1960s and mid-1980s, it was declared that the Daily Star‚Äîedited by George Taylor‚Äîwas the workplace of the Golden Age or \\"Earth-Two\\" Clark Kent, Lois Lane and office boy-turned-cub reporter Jimmy Olsen, while the Daily Planet‚Äîedited by Perry White‚Äîwas unique to their Silver Age or \\"Earth-One\\" counterparts. In the Silver Age continuity, Perry White was promoted to editor-in-chief upon the retirement of the Earth-One version of George Taylor (this took place while Clark Kent was in college). The Perry White of Earth- Two, however, was a lead reporter for the Daily Star and \\"filled in\\" as editor from time to time when Taylor was away. Clark Kent of Earth-2 advanced his reporting career to become Lead Investigative Reporter for the Daily Star. But, always mindful of his dual persona, he largely maintained a retiring manner. In the meantime, Kent (and Superman) befriended Jimmy Olsen, who'd started as a pre-teen office boy at the Daily Star in the 1930s but became a cub reporter when he published the story of Superman's defeat of the Archer (Superman #13). In the late 1940s, would-be crime lord Colonel Future challenged the Wizard, a rumored sorcerer, to eliminate the Man of Steel. The Wizard cast a spell to rid the world of Superman, but merely made Clark repress the memory of his alter ego. As a result, Kent became an aggressive, crusading reporter who won the heart‚Äîand hand‚Äîof Lois Lane. But when she discovered Clark's secret on their honeymoon, Lois tracked down the Wizard and made him reverse the spell. (Action Comics #484.) George Taylor retired in the early 1950s, and Kent was selected over Perry White as the new Editor-in-Chief of the Daily Star. Lois Lane-Kent was promoted to Lead Investigative Reporter while James Olsen became a managing editor. When, in the mid-1980s, the multiverse collapsed into a single new universe (Crisis on Infinite Earths #10), the history and most of the people of Earth-2 were wiped from existence. However, Lois Lane-Kent was saved from the universal reboot and went with her husband to live in a pocket dimension (Crisis on Infinite Earths #12). Modern Age In the post-Crisis universe, the Daily Star is occasionally mentioned, suggesting it is a separate newspaper. For nearly twenty years, Superman was content in the \\"paradise\\" dimension until Lois fell ill (Infinite Crisis Secret Files 2006). Believing that seeing home would revitalize her, Superman built a replica of the Daily Star building. This failed to help, however. When Lois finally died, she told her husband that she was happy to have lived such a long life. In week 38 of 52, it is implied that the Star is owned by Lex Luthor, or at the very least, is highly sympathetic to him, and skeptical of metahumans. The New 52 In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Action Comics runs stories set five years in the past, where Clark works for the Daily Star under Taylor, while Lois and Jimmy work for Stars competitor, The Daily Planet. In the re- launched Superman comic, set in present day, Clark has joined the staff of the Daily Planet with Jimmy and Lois. References *Daily Star.

Tokyo Gore Police was released to several film festivals in North America. It received generally positive reviews, noting that it lives up to its title by being gory, perverse and bizarre. Plot The film is set in a near future chaotic Japan. A mad scientist known as \\"Key Man\\" (Itsuji Itao) has created a virus that mutates humans into monstrous creatures called \\"Engineers\\" that sprout bizarre weapons from any injury. The Tokyo Police Force has been privatized to deal with this new threat of engineers, so a special squad of officers called \\"Engineer Hunters\\" are created to deal with them. However, unlike the average police force, the Engineer Hunters are a private quasi-military force that utilize violence, sadism, and streetside executions to maintain law and order. Helping the police force is Ruka (Eihi Shiina), a troubled loner who is very skilled in dispatching the Engineers. Along with helping the police, she is looking for the killer of her father, an old-fashioned officer who was murdered in broad daylight by a mysterious assassin. Ruka soon receives a new case to hunt down Key Man, but once she encounters him, he infects her by inserting a key-shaped tumor into her scar- riddled left forearm before disappearing. Meanwhile, a police officer (Yukihide Benny) becomes infected while visiting a strip-club filled with Engineers and massacres the main precinct, causing the Tokyo police commissioner (Shun Sugata) to order a city-wide crackdown on Engineers ‚Äî indiscriminately executing anyone suspected of being one. While continuing her investigation, Ruka visits Key Man's home, where he reveals the truth about their past. His father was a police sniper who resigned after a sniping operation gone wrong. Desperate to keep his family out of poverty, he was paid to assassinate Ruka's father, who was leading a rally against the privatization of the police force. But shortly after gunning down Ruka's father before her eyes, he was murdered by the police commissioner ‚Äî the real mastermind of the assassination ‚Äî in front of Key Man. Swearing to avenge his father's death, he injected himself with the DNA of several infamous criminals, mutating him into his present form. After realizing that she and Key Man are seeking vengeance on the same man, Ruka slices him in half with her katana before heading back to the precinct. On her way, she witnesses the police force brutalizing civilians accused of being Engineers. When her bar owner friend (Ikuko Sawada) is drawn and quartered, Ruka's left arm mutates into an alien-like head with razor-sharp claws before she beheads the officers behind the execution. During her rampage, she is shot in the right eye, but her body quickly replaces it with a cybernetic eye. She confronts the police commissioner, who admits to her father's assassination, but explains that he raised her to become the perfect Engineer Hunter as atonement. Following a gruelling sword fight, Ruka dismembers and eventually decapitates the commissioner ‚Äî effectively bringing down his reign on the police force. During the end credits, it is revealed that Key Man is still alive, having mended himself back into one piece with the help of one of his test subjects.

Nishimura decided to make Tokyo Gore Police, a remake of an independent film that he made many years before called Anatomia Extinction which received the Special Jury Award in the Off Theatre competition at the 1995 Yubari International Fantastic Film Festival. Shot and completed in just two weeks, Tokyo Gore Police would be Nishumura's first commercial film. The fight choreographer for the film was Taku Sakaguchi who Nishimura has worked with previously on the film Meatball Machine. The comical yet satirical television commercial scenes in the film were filmed by Noboru Iguchi and Y≈´dai Yamaguchi. Yamaguchi suggested this to bring a different flavor to the film to balance out the rest of the film's more dark tone. Release Tokyo Gore Police premiered in several film festivals before being released in Japan. The film had its North American premiere at the New York Asian Film Festival on June 21, 2008. The film premiered in Canada at the Fantasia Festival on July 12, 2008. The film has its Asian premiere at the Puchon International Fantastic Film Festival in July 2008. A Region 1 DVD of the film was released on January 13, 2009 by Tokyo Shock A Region 2 DVD of the film was released on April 13, 2009 by 4Digital Media. A straight to video prequel has been announced for release in Japan.  Critical reception  Tokyo Gore Police was received well by American critics on its original release. The film ranking website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 82% \\"Fresh\\" rating and an average rating of 6 out of 10, based upon a sample of eleven reviews. Brian Chen reviewed Police with a score of 3.5/5. He comments, \\"It's not a horrible film; it's not a great film; it's just everything it tries to be ‚Äî perverse, grotesque, bizarre ‚Äî and a little more.\\" V.A. Musetto of the New York Post gave the film three stars out of four calling the film \\"bloody good\\". Michael Esposito of the Chicago Tribune gave the film three stars noting the film as \\"sick, twisted and gory, but surprisingly funny in an adolescent boy fantasy way ‚Äî Beavis and Butt-head would love it.\\" Russel Edwards of Variety claimed, \\"Like Tokyo Shock's recent \\"Machine Girl,\\" for which helmer provided gore effects, [the] pic[ture] will fleetingly exist in midnight sidebars at fests and much longer on fanboy ancillary.\\" Edwards also said that Tokyo Gore Police had \\"occasionally witty moments, but the relentless catalog of mutilations lacks the emotional power of similar fare in pics by, say, fellow Japanese gorehound Shinya Tsukomoto [sic].\\" References External links 2008 films 2000s action thriller films Japanese films Japanese action films Japanese action thriller films Japanese science fiction horror films Japanese-language films Films directed by Yoshihiro Nishimura Dystopian films Girls with guns films Nikkatsu films Tokyo Shock Japanese science fiction films Japanese horror films Splatter films 2000s exploitation films Japanese action horror films Japanese comedy horror films Japanese action comedy films 2000s action comedy films Japanese comedy films 2008 comedy films 2000s monster movies Japanese films about revenge 2000s science fiction action films Exploitation films ","title":"Tokyo Gore Police"}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:I}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},B={class:"card-container"};function F(s,e,o,c,u,i){const m=f("PoemCard");return t(),n(h,null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("section",null,[a("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâ your ETHü•≥")])])],-1)),a("section",null,[a("div",B,[(t(!0),n(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,p)=>(t(),b(m,{key:p,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const E=d(P,[["render",F]]),H=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/65.md","filePath":"guide/65.md"}'),R={name:"guide/65.md"},N=Object.assign(R,{setup(s){return(e,o)=>(t(),n("div",null,[v(E)]))}});export{H as __pageData,N as default};
