This changed with the passage of new organ donation laws in 2008. If two patients have the same medical need, priority will now go to the patient who has signed an organ donor card, or whose family members have donated an organ (though medical necessity still takes precedence). This policy was nicknamed don't give, don't get. The law also defines \\"brain death\\" as an indication of death for all legal purposes, including organ donation. Additionally the law provides financial reimbursement to living donors for medical expenses due to donation and lost time at work. Organ trafficking is explicitly banned. Health insurance plans can no longer reimburse patients who go abroad to receive transplants. Currently, although the rate of organ donation is still relatively low, it is rising.  Legal status  Until 2008, there was no law prohibiting organ trafficking in Israel. In 2008, the Knesset approved two laws designed to regulate organ donations. The first law defines brain-respiratory death as a situation in which person who has no blood pressure, fails to breathe without external life support systems and has no response from the pupils or any other reflexes is declared dead by two certified doctors.Knesset approves organ donation law The second law provides for various benefits to living organ donors, such as reimbursement for medical expenses and lost work up to 18,000 NIS (roughly US$5,000), priority on the transplant list should they require a future organ donation,Organ Donation: Legal, But Still Controversial waived self- participation fee for any medical service resulting from the donation, and the attainment of a \\"chronic patient\\" status, which entitles the holder to additional medical benefits. In addition, the law criminalizes organ trafficking, receiving compensation for organs, or acting as an organ broker. This law was cited as a model by proposed 2009 legislation in the US. Organizations  Israel operates a National Transplant and Organ Donation Center, established in 1993 as an institute of the Ministry of Health.Organ donation and transplantation, Orit Brawer Ben-David, p.143, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2005 The center incorporates the ADI organization, founded by private citizens, which maintains a database of donors and sponsors donor cards. As of 2009, the database contains around 500,000 names of donors, about 10% of Israel's adult population. Since some ultra-religious Jews feel the 2008 law does not properly address halachic questions, Israel's Chief Rabbinate has decided to issue an organ donor card of its own, which allows organ harvesting from the potential donor only if brain death is determined according to the strictest letter of the law - for example by requiring that brain death be confirmed using electronic equipment rather than just the determination of a physician.Organ donation to get halachic approval The Halachic Organ Donor Society is active in Israel trying to raise awareness about Halachic acceptance of brain-stem death and support of organ donation. Most Israelis are secular but when it comes to death, most turn to Orthodox rabbis to seek guidance. That is why Israel has one of the lowest organ donor rates in the Western world. The Halachic Organ Donor Society has succeeded in recruiting more than 230 rabbis to register for organ donor cards. It has given presentations to over 30,000 Jews around the world to encourage them to donate organs to the general public. This public awareness campaign has increased the number of Israelis who have signed organ donor cards.  Prevalence of donations  Both Orthodox Jews and the majority secular Jewish population often cite Jewish law as the reason for not donating. The rate of agreement to organ donation is only 45%, which is 50% lower than the rate in most Western countries. The percentage of people who hold an organ donation card in Israel is only 14 percent;http://www.health.gov.il/English/Topics/organ_transplant/Pages/kartis_ADI.aspx Israel Ministry of Health - ADI in Western countries the rate is 30-40%. As a result, there are about 1,000 Israelis currently on the \\"waiting list\\" for organs, and it is estimated that roughly 10% of them die annually, due to a lack of donations. Yaakov Levi, the director of the Heart Transplant Unit at Sheba Medical Center has called for organs to be allocated first to those who are willing to donate their own organs and have possessed a donor card for several years. This call was accepted and incorporated into the 2008 law. According to the New York Times, \\"Organ donation rates in Israel are among the lowest in the developed world, about one-third the rate in Western Europe, in large part because of what Health Ministry officials and doctors describe as a widespread impression that Jewish law prohibits transplants as a 'desecration of the body......'\\"  Organ trafficking  According to organ trade expert Nancy Scheper-Hughes of Organ Watch (in 2001), Israel had become a \\"pariah\\" in the organ transplant world. The lack of donations due to Jewish custom heightened the disparity between the supply and demand of organs. This led to the popularity of \\"transplant tourism\\" in which patients in need of organs travel to medical centres abroad to receive organs. Prior to the 2008 law prohibiting it, some Israeli organ brokers advertised on the radio and in newspapers. Kidneys, which are the most traded organ, may fetch up to $150,000 for brokers who usually pay the donors far less. The Jewish weekly newspaper The Forward reported in the wake of this scandal that an Organ Trafficking Prohibition Act of 2009, sponsored by Democratic Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, has yet to be officially introduced in the U.S., but that its proposed language cites Israel as a model of a country that has enacted a law providing benefits for organ donors. The lack of regulations against organ trafficking prior to 2008 made Israel a focal point for the international organ trade. Health insurance would reimburse Israelis for organ transplants done abroad, but this has been banned in the new law. As a result of all the abuses of the illegal market in human organs, there is a growing movement of activists in Israel and in America to legalize a Government-regulated program to offer financial incentives to people for living kidney donations and to families for deceased donations from brain-stem dead donors. This movement is headed, among other organizations, by the Alliance for Organ Donor Incentives.  The Aftonbladet accusations  In August 2009 the Swedish tabloid Aftonbladet published an article alleging that in 1992 the Israeli Defense Force took organs from Palestinians who died in Israeli custody.Aftonbladet: \\"Our sons are plundered of their organs\\" The allegations were denied by Israel, and the article caused a diplomatic row between Israel and Sweden. However the author of the article, Donald Bostr√∂m, spoke to Israel Radio on 19 August 2009 and said he was worried by the allegations he reported: \\"It concerns me, to the extent that I want it to be investigated, that's true. But whether it's true or not ‚Äî I have no idea, I have no clue.\\" In December an interview was broadcast on Israeli television during which Israel's chief pathologist, Dr. Yehuda Hiss, discussed the harvesting of organs in the 1990s at the Abu Kabir Forensic Institute. The interview was followed by a confirmation from Israeli officials that organs were taken in the 1990s without the permission of families of the deceased. Officials denied that the practice continued, and noted that both Israeli and Palestinian organs were taken without permission. \\"We started to harvest corneas for various hospitals in Israel,\\" Hiss said in an interview on Israel's Channel 2 network. \\"Whatever was done was highly informal. No permission was asked from the families,\\" he said.

Transferred to the Royal Navy and commissioned as Dacres on 28 August 1943, the ship was named after Vice Admiral James Richard Dacres (1749‚Äì1810). Service history Dacres was attached to the B4 Escort Group based at Belfast, which comprised three destroyers and two Captain class frigates ( and ), and carried out escort duties in the Atlantic. Dacres was one of three Captain class ships (along with and ) selected for conversion to headquarters ships for use during \\"Operation Neptune\\" ‚Äì the invasion of France. Her aft three-inch (76 mm) gun and all the depth charge gear was removed and the superstructure extended to provide accommodation for extra Staff Officers; two deck houses were built for communications equipment and a small main mast added to support more aerials. Four more 20 mm Oerlikons were fitted, and a number of radar sets installed. For the invasion Dacres sailed from Portsmouth, even though her forward motor room had flooded, which compelled her to sail on only one engine. However she could still make about 16 knots, which was enough for her to lead in her convoy of assault ships to her group position off Sword on schedule at daybreak on D-Day ‚Äì 6 June 1944. As the Allied forces moved inland the staff officers were transferred ashore, and Dacres joined Kingsmill in patrolling the Normandy anchorage until August, when she sailed for Portsmouth, salvaging an abandoned Liberty ship on the way. At Portsmouth dockyard she was stripped of the additional superstructure and guns, and restored to working order, before returning to Belfast in early 1945 to join the 10th Escort Group. Although the group sank three U-boats during February Dacres was not credited with helping in any of these kills. In April 1945 she was transferred to the 15th Escort Group until VE Day, after which she was put into reserve until returned to the United States Navy on 26 January 1946.

It opened in 1885 and closed in 1964. History Most of the line was built over the route of the southern section of the Herefordshire and Gloucestershire Canal, which had opened in 1798. =Construction and opening= After a period of financial struggle the canal was leased to the Great Western Railway (GWR) in 1863 and in 1881 work started on conversion to a railway. The railway was built by two companies, the Newent Railway and the Ross and Ledbury Railway. The line was inspected by Colonel F. H. Rich in July 1885 and opened on 27 July. It was operated by the GWR with which both of the smaller companies were amalgamated in 1892. =Closure= The line closed to passenger traffic in 1959, with the Dymock to Gloucester section remaining open to goods traffic until 1964. Route The line followed a south and then south-easterly route between Ledbury railway station and Gloucester Central railway station, it joined the Gloucester to Newport Line at Over Junction.Stan Yorke, Lost Railways of Gloucestershire, 2009, Stations were constructed at Ledbury Town Halt, Greenway Halt, Dymock, Four Oaks Halt, Newent, Malswick Halt and Barbers Bridge.

It proposed to give the National Assembly the power to declare Quebec \\"sovereign\\", with the \\"exclusive power to pass all its laws, levy all its taxes and conclude all its treaties\\".Act Respecting the Future of Quebec (Bill), art. 1‚Äì2. It received a first reading in the National AssemblyNational Assembly of Quebec, travaux parlementaires, book 70 (7 September 1995) p.4708 (Archive) but the final version of the bill was never voted on following the defeat of the sovereignty option in the 1995 Quebec referendum. Had it become law, it would have served as the legal basis for the Quebec government to declare Quebec a sovereign country. Preamble The bill contained a 1,586-word preamble, evoking the history of Quebec and the right of the Quebec people to choose its destiny. It also contained considerable poetic phrases, such as \\"We know the winter in our souls. We know its blustery days, its solitude, its false eternity and its apparent deaths.\\" It concluded with the phrase, \\"We, the people of Qu√©bec, through our National Assembly, proclaim: Qu√©bec is a sovereign country.\\"Act Respecting the Future of Quebec, preamble The original version of the bill had a blank page as its preamble. Jacques Parizeau explained it this way: \\"[T]he preamble... has intentionally been left unwritten. This preamble will eventually become the Declaration of Sovereignty of Quebec. It must describe who we are as a people and who we wish to become. As such, it must be a vivid reflection of our values and our hopes, our traditions and our ambitions. This blank page calls out to all of us. We must devise it together, participate and contribute the best of ourselves.\\"Jacques Parizeau, \\"A message from the Prime Minister\\" (20 August 1995) In the end, the preamble was written by several prominent pro-sovereignty Quebec writers and poets, including famous Quebec singer Gilles Vigneault, author-playwright Marie Laberge, sociologist Fernand Dumont and constitutional experts Andr√©e Lajoie and Henri Brun.\\"'We, the people of Quebec, declare . . .'\\". The Toronto Star (7 September 1995) Main text In addition to declaring Quebec a sovereign country, the bill lays out several key steps in the independence process. It required the Government of Quebec to propose to the rest of Canada a partnership treaty based on a \\"Tripartite Agreement\\" signed on 12 June 1995 between Parizeau, Bloc Qu√©b√©cois leader Lucien Bouchard and Action democratique du Quebec leader, Mario Dumont. This agreement outlined a series of proposals that the leaders agreed a sovereign Quebec would make to Canada to share power between the two countries, including in the areas of: * customs union; * free movement of goods; * free movement of individuals; * free movement of services; * free movement of capital; * monetary policy; * labour mobility; and * citizenship.Act Respecting the Future of Quebec, Schedule The Bill provided that negotiations on a partnership treaty could not extend past 30 October 1996 (one year after the 1995 referendum).Act Respecting the Future of Quebec, art. 26 The Bill also foresaw the drafting of a new Quebec constitution,Act Respecting the Future of Quebec, arts. 6‚Äì9 the continuity of Quebec's current boundaries,Act Respecting the Future of Quebec, art. 10 the creation of a Quebec citizenship,Act Respecting the Future of Quebec, arts. 11‚Äì13 use of the Canadian dollar Act Respecting the Future of Quebec, art. 14 and continuity of current laws and social benefits.Act Respecting the Future of Quebec, arts. 18‚Äì22 Political significance The bill was part of the Quebec government's strategy to increase support for sovereignty prior to the 1995 referendum. The Parti Qu√©b√©cois promised during the 1994 Quebec election to hold a referendum during 1995. However, the Parti Qu√©b√©cois received only 0.35% more votes than the federalist Quebec Liberal Party in that election, and polls at the time showed that Quebec independence (at least, without significant economic and political links with Canada) was not supported by the majority of Quebecers. Along with the February 1995 hearings on the future of Quebec and 12 June 1995 Tripartite agreement between Parizeau, Bouchard and Dumont, the sovereignty bill was designed to both get people interested in discussing Quebec sovereignty and reassure Quebecers about the likelihood that a sovereign Quebec would retain links with Canada. As part of this strategy, the draft bill was sent to every Quebec household by the Quebec government in advance of the referendum campaign, along with a copy of the Parizeau- Bouchard-Dumont agreement of 12 June 1995. Despite these efforts, polls did not show a significant increase in support for Quebec sovereignty until the final weeks of the October 1995 referendum campaign. The bill was explicitly referred to in the question appearing on the ballot in the 1995 Quebec sovereignty referendum: \\"Do you agree that Qu√©bec should become sovereign after having made a formal offer to Canada for a new economic and political partnership within the scope of the bill respecting the future of Qu√©bec and of the agreement signed on 12 June 1995?.\\" See also *1995 Quebec referendum *List of documents from the constitutional history of Canada *Quebec sovereignty movement *Politics of Quebec External links *Draft Bill Respecting the Future of Quebec (original version introduced into the National Assembly and sent to Quebec households) *Final text of the Act Respecting the Future of Quebec given a first reading by the National Assembly but never proclaimed into law References Political history of Quebec 1995 in Canadian law Quebec sovereignty movement Quebec Legislature Proposed laws of Canada 1995 in Quebec ","title":"Act Respecting the Future of Quebec"},{"id":"23750190","text":"The molecular formula C21H26N2O3 may refer to: * Corynanthine * Dregamine * Rauwolscine * Rhazine * Stemmadenine * Tabernaemontanine * Vincamine * Yohimbine ","title":"C21H26N2O3"},{"id":"23750207","text":"Sarah Crane (born 9 September 1972 in Brisbane) is an Australian operatic soprano.

Incumbent President Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya won the election with 91% of the vote. Voter turnout was 74.7%.Dieter Nohlen, Michael Krennerich & Bernhard Thibaut (1999) Elections in Africa: A data handbook, p597 Background President Taya came to power in a coup d'√©tat in 1984 and ruled Mauritania as one-party state for the next 8 years. Under the 1991 constitution multi-party democracy was introduced with Taya being elected with 62% of the vote in the 1992 presidential election. However the opposition alleged that the 1992 election had been fraudulent and the main opposition groups in Mauritania boycotted the 1997 election as they said it would not be a fair contest with, for instance, the electoral commission not being independent. Candidates The campaign began on 27 November with President Taya the clear favourite. Taya focused on the performance of the economy and reinforcing democracy during his campaign. Taya was backed by the Mouvance Presidentielle, which included the Rally for Democracy and Unity (RDU) and a faction of the Union of Democratic Forces. Four candidates challenged Taya including, Kane Amadou Moctar, the first black African to run for president in a country that had been dominated politically by Moors since independence. Moctar was a former hospital administrator who pledged to oppose slavery and establish a new policy of fisheries. Chbih Ould Cheikh Malainine was a former cabinet minister who had quit the RDU to form his own party and campaigned to eliminate slavery. Moulaye El Hacen Ould Jeid was the secretary general of the Mauritanian Party for Renewal and Concord and in his campaign called for press censorship to be ended. Lastly Mohammed Mahmoud Ould Mah was the secretary general of the Popular Social and Democratic Union. He had contested the 1992 election and pledged to renegotiate agreements with the European Union and International Monetary Fund if he was elected. Results President Taya won the election with official figures showing a turnout of around 74%, however the opposition claimed that their boycott had been successful and did not accept the official results.

It is native to Europe and Asia, where it is common, and it is an introduced species in much of North America and Africa.Interactive Agricultural Ecological Atlas of Russia and Neighboring Countries It is well known as a noxious weed where it is naturalized and also in many parts of its native range. This is an annual herb producing an erect stem often with sprays of many long, bending branches, its form varying in different regions and climates. The plant may approach a meter in height. The stems are lined with linear to oval leaves up to 5 centimeters long and coated in whitish hairs, and the herbage emits a scent generally considered unpleasant.Non-native Plant Species of Alaska: European Stickseed The inflorescence is a long, leafy raceme of tiny flowers near the ends of the branches. Each flower is 2 to 4 millimeters wide with five light blue corolla lobes. White-flowered plants are occasionally seen. The fruit is a cluster of four nutlets which are coated in hooked prickles. The seeds are dispersed when the prickles get caught on animal coats and human clothing, and when they are moved by wind. This plant grows easily in a wide range of habitat types, including agricultural fields, roadsides, gravel beds, and rocky waste places. It thrives in overgrazed pastures.

Together with the adjacent building at No. 50, it is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building. The buildings incorporate part of the Chester Rows. The stone frontage at the street and row levels of No. 48 is considered to be the earliest shop front still surviving in England. It was once the largest known medieval town house in the Chester Rows, and the stone-walled hall at the row level extending to No. 50 was the largest hall set parallel to the rows in Chester. History The building was constructed in the 13th century. During the 14th century it was extended to the south (into what is now No. 50), when the hall, set parallel to the rows, was built. During the 20th century part of the building was used by William Jones, a grocer. In the 1960s the business was taken over by the department store of Owen Owen, but this closed in 1999. The ground floor continues to be used as a shop. Architecture=Exterior= At the level of the row are three round-headed chamfered arches, the piers of which pass down to the ground level, at the sides of the windows and entrance of the shop at this level. Above the arches, in Gothic script, is the inscription \\"Three Old Arches\\". Duplicated at the tops of the piers, between the arches, is the date \\"1274 AD\\". Above the arches are three sash windows, each with 12 panes and, in the top storey is another sash window, this one being tripartite, with 4:12:4 panes. =Interior= In the undercroft of No. 48, the original stone pillars have been replaced by cast iron columns. The undercroft of No. 50 retains its original stone arch. Much of the medieval stone hall remains at the level of the row, which extends between Nos. 48 and 50. It is the largest stone-walled hall set parallel with the row in Chester, measuring over 12m by over 8m, and it contains four medieval doorways. The hall also contains a 16th century open fireplace with a 19th century cast iron range.

The film, a jihad satire following a group of homegrown terrorist jihadis from Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England, stars Riz Ahmed, Kayvan Novak, Nigel Lindsay, Arsher Ali and Adeel Akhtar. Plot A group of radicalised young British Muslim men aspire to be suicide bombers. They are Omar (Riz Ahmed), who is deeply critical of Western society and interventionism; his dim-witted cousin Waj (Kayvan Novak); Barry (Nigel Lindsay), a bad-tempered and extremely rash white convert to Islam; and the naive Faisal (Adeel Akhtar), who tries to train crows to be used as bombers. While Omar and Waj travel to an al Qaeda-affiliated training camp in Pakistan, Barry recruits a reluctant fifth member, Hassan (Arsher Ali). The training trip ends in disaster when Omar attempts to shoot down an American drone and accidentally destroys part of the camp; the pair are forced to flee. However, Omar uses the experience to assert authority on his return to Britain. Omar and Waj don't trust Hassan when they first meet him at the airport, but Omar reluctantly chooses to allow him to join the group instead of murdering him to stop him exposing the plan. The group disagrees about what the target should be. Barry wants to bomb a local mosque as a false flag operation to \\"radicalise the moderates\\", but Omar considers this idiotic. Faisal suggests blowing up a branch of the pharmacy chain Boots because it sells contraceptives and tampons, but Omar states it is a not a worthwhile target. Omar's conservative but pacifist brother visits him and tries to talk him out of doing anything violent; however, Omar and his wife mock him for keeping his wife in a small room and squirt him with water pistols, making him flee. After the group begins production of the explosives TATP, Hassan is left alone to watch the safehouse as Barry takes Waj and Faisal out to a field for a test- detonation of a small amount of TATP contained in Omar's microwave, using a nearby fireworks show to cover the sound. Omar berates Barry for doing this in his absence, and because Barry was supposed to stay behind at the safehouse since he's likely being watched by the police. Omar and Barry are still arguing as the group returns to the safehouse, but are interrupted when they find Hassan dancing with an oblivious neighbour (Julia Davis). The group suspects they have been compromised and transport their volatile explosives to a new location in grocery bags. Faisal trips up while crossing a field and is killed in the explosion. This angers Omar, who berates the others and leaves. Faisal's head is found and Omar visits the others to tell them. They reconcile, and Omar decides to target the upcoming London Marathon due to having access to mascot costumes, which they use to conceal the explosives. Meanwhile, armed police raid Omar's brother's house. The group drive to London in their costumes and prepare to attack. Waj expresses doubts about the morality of their plot, but Omar convinces him to go through with it. A police officer approaches the group, but is satisfied and leaves after a brief conversation. Hassan loses his nerve and tries to alert the officer, but is killed when Barry detonates his bomb remotely. The remaining three panic and run away, and the police start searching for them. Omar has a change of heart, feeling guilt about manipulating the easily led Waj into dying for a cause he doesn't understand and attempts to prevent the attack. Police snipers receive Omar's description and shoot at him as he attempts to blend in with the runners, but mistakenly kill a bystander in a similar costume instead. Waj is cornered by police in a kebab shop and takes the staff hostage. Omar contacts Waj from his mobile phone and convinces him to let all but one of the hostages go. Barry finds Omar during the phonecall, snatches the phone and swallows the SIM card, however, as Barry begins to choke, a well-meaning passer-by attempts to perform the Heimlich manoeuvre, forcing Omar to flee before Barry's explosives are inadvertently detonated. Omar hurries to a nearby mobile phone store to buy a new SIM card to contact Waj, but leaves empty handed due to the frustratingly slow employees and convoluted signup process. Omar spots a colleague (Craig Parkinson) and borrows his phone. He attempts to talk Waj down, but his call is interrupted when the police charge in and kill the remaining hostage whom they mistake for Waj. Confused, Waj detonates his bomb, killing everyone in the kebab shop. Distraught, Omar walks into a nearby Boots pharmacy and detonates his bomb. In an epilogue, it is revealed that the police later arrested Omar's innocent brother as a terrorist; that they deflect responsibility for shooting the hostage and bystander; and that Omar unknowingly killed Osama Bin Laden when misfiring his rocket in Pakistan.

In a separate interview, he asserts that the research predated the 7 July 2005 London bombings: Morris suggested in a mass email, titled \\"Funding Mentalism\\", that fans could contribute between ¬£25 and ¬£100 each to the production costs of the film and would appear as extras in return. Funding was secured in October 2008 from Film 4 Productions and Warp Films, with Derrin Schlesinger & Mark Herbert producing. Filming began in Sheffield in May 2009. Morris has described the film as a farce, which exposes the \\"Dad's Army side to terrorism\\". During the making of the film, the director sent the script to former Guant√°namo Bay detainee Moazzam Begg. Begg has said that he found nothing in the script that would be offensive to British Muslims. The actor Riz Ahmed also contacted Begg, to ask whether the subject matter was \\"too raw\\". When the film was completed, Begg was given a special screening and said that he enjoyed it. The film's music supervisor was Phil Canning. The song \\"Avril 14th\\" by electronic musician Aphex Twin plays during the film's ending credits. Release The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2010 and was short-listed for the festival's World Cinema Narrative prize. Introducing the film's premiere, Morris said: \\"I feel in a weird way that this is a good-hearted film. It's not a hate film, so I would hope that aspect would come through.\\" The UK premi√®re took place at the National Media Museum as part of Bradford International Film Festival on 25 March 2010, and was followed by a nationwide release on 7 May. Despite its acclaim at the Sundance Film Festival, Four Lions failed to find a distributor in the U.S. for nine months, until the newly formed Drafthouse Films picked it up. The film had a limited release in the US on 5 November 2010. Four Lions was released in the UK on DVD and Blu- ray on 30 August 2010, and in the U.S. on 8 March 2011. Reception=Critical response= Four Lions received positive reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a \\"Certified Fresh\\" score of 83%, based on 134 reviews, with an average rating of 7.3/10. The site's consensus reads, \\"Its premise suggests brazenly tasteless humor, but Four Lions is actually a smart, pitch-black comedy that carries the unmistakable ring of truth.\\" Metacritic gives the film a score of 68 out of 100, based on 28 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews.\\" The Daily Telegraph wrote that \\"[Chris Morris's] evocations of the claustrophobic mundanity of the Muslims' lives, their querulous banter, their flimsily pick 'n' mix approach to the Koran all feel painfully, brilliantly real.\\" The Daily Express rated Four Lions 4/5 and praised the performances in particular, calling the film \\"brilliantly cast with all the actors displaying sharp comic timing and both [Riz] Ahmed and [Kayvan] Novak also bringing out the touching humanity of their characters.\\" Upon its screening at Sundance, the Los Angeles Times and The Hollywood Reporter gave the film extremely positive reviews, the latter describing the film as \\"a brilliant takedown of the imbecility of fanaticism\\" drawing comparisons with This Is Spinal Tap and The Three Stooges. Amongst the reviewers that gave the film negative and mixed reviews were Nigel Andrews of the Financial Times, who called the film a \\"spectacular miss\\" and The Guardians Jeremy Kay, who wrote \\"as a satire on terror, Four Lions seems to be a missed opportunity\\". Andrew Pulver, also writing for The Guardian, gave the film a more favourable review, stating that \\"Chris Morris is still the most incendiary figure working in the British entertainment industry.\\" The UK premiere at the National Media Museum in Bradford was followed by a question and answer session with Chris Morris, Jesse Armstrong, Sam Bain, three of the principal actors, and two of the producers. Morris stated that he does not find the film at all controversial and that attempting to cause controversy is \\"one of the most boring things you can do\\". Morris also gave a talk introducing the film at a summer 2010 screening at Latitude Festival in Suffolk. =Box office= Despite an initial release on just 115 screens across the UK, the film was successful at the box office on its opening weekend, generating the highest site average of all the new releases (¬£5,292) and making a total of ¬£609,000. According to the Official Top 10 UK Film Chart (7‚Äì9 May 2010), Four Lions was placed at sixth, behind Iron Man 2, Furry Vengeance, A Nightmare on Elm Street, Hot Tub Time Machine and The Back-up Plan. Due to its popularity, Optimum Releasing increased the number of screens showing the film to 200. As of 8 August 2010, Four Lions grossed ¬£2,932,366 at the UK box office. As of 13 March 2011, Four Lions worldwide gross was US$4,353,954. =Accolades= Time Magazine rated the film as among Top 10 movies of the year 2010. The lead actors, Kayvan Novak and Nigel Lindsay, were both nominated for Best Comedy Performance in Film at the British Comedy Awards 2010. Kayvan Novak went on to win the award, thanking all his \\"brothers\\"‚Äîreferring to his fellow actors in Four Lions. At the BAFTAs 2011, Chris Morris won the award for Outstanding Debut by a British Writer, Director or Producer. He beat competition from The Arbor, Exit Through the Gift Shop, Monsters and Skeletons.

In 2000, he made the short film Der Atemk√ºnstler, for which he was nominated for the Talent award First Steps, and in 2002, he made a TV pilot, Rec ‚Äì Kassettenm√§dchen/Kassettenjungs. In 2003, his first feature-length film, Ganz und gar, which describes the life of a young leg amputee, was released in theaters. This was followed in 2004 by the drama Sommersturm (Summer Storm), which, according to Kreuzpaintner, resembles his own coming out as a young homosexual. In 2006, he wrote the screenplay for the film version of the youth novel Die Wolke. In 2007, Trade was released internationally. The film focuses on the subject of human trafficking, forced prostitution, and modern slavery. Trade was produced by Rosilyn Heller and was originally supposed to be directed by Roland Emmerich. However, as he was involved in preparation for directing 10.000 B.C. at the time, another director was sought, and Emmerich chose Kreuzpaintner, having met him previously in Munich in 2003. On October 9, 2008, Krabat, an adaptation of the youth novel of the same name by Otfried Preu√üler was released, starring Robert Stadlober, Daniel Br√ºhl and David Kross. In 2009, Kreuzpaintner founded the production company Summerstorm Entertainment in Berlin, along with producers Ossie von Richthofen and Fabian Wolfart. One of the company's first projects is a Brazilian-German co- production with the working title Her Name Was Lola. The film is a romantic comedy which will be filmed in English, and deals with a woman from London, who falls in love with a young man from Rio de Janeiro. The Brazilian actor Jonathan Haagensen will play the male lead role. Filming should begin in the beginning of the next year in London and Rio.

Life and times Mart√≠nez was born and raised in C√≥rdoba, Argentina. He enrolled in the National University of C√≥rdoba, received a law degree in 1948 and in 1955, he participated in a Southern Methodist University conference on fossil fuel policy. He began teaching land law at his alma mater in 1956 and earning a juris doctor, in 1957. Active in the centrist Radical Civic Union (UCR), Mart√≠nez entered politics and was elected to the Provincial Senate, in 1962. He was elected Mayor of C√≥rdoba in 1963 and remained in the post until a coup d'√©tat removed President Arturo Illia (a fellow UCR figure), in 1966.Academia Nacional de Derecho y Ciencias Sociales: V√≠ctor Mart√≠nez Mart√≠nez returned to academia and edited Los Principios, a local newsdaily, from 1970 to 1972. During new elections in 1973, he ran unsuccessfully for Governor of C√≥rdoba Province. Continuing to teach at the university, he served on government advisory panels on the local, provincial, and national levels on the subject of land law. He established the Argentine Society of Natural Resource Law and Management and was named Dean of the Land Law Department at the University of C√≥rdoba, in 1979. Following seven years of a failed military dictatorship, elections were called for October 1983. The UCR, which held its convention in July of that year, nominated a center-left former Congressman and human rights lawyer, Ra√∫l Alfons√≠n, for President and Mart√≠nez (who, as a somewhat more conservative figure, would help balance the ticket) for Vice President. Following weeks of tied polling with the Justicialist Party, the UCR won the elections by 12%, and Mart√≠nez was elected Vice President.Todo Argentina: 1983 Sworn in on December 10, Mart√≠nez's role as President of the Argentine Senate became critical given the Justicialists' advantage of 21 Senators to the UCR's 18. He was unable, however, to prevent their defeat of Alfons√≠n's Labor Union Reform Law of 1984 or of the proposed, 1987 transfer of the nation's capital to Viedma (both, key issues to the President). Mart√≠nez made numerous diplomatic visits abroad as Vice President. He was designated Honorary Citizen of California by Governor George Deukmejian, in 1985, and was made an Honorary Member of the Inter-American Bar Association, in 1986. Ultimately, however, a sharp currency crisis and sudden rioting forced Alfons√≠n to advance the planned, December 1989 inaugural of his successor, Carlos Menem, by five months, and Mart√≠nez tendered his resignation on June 30 (effective Alfons√≠n's July 8 handover).Todo Argentina: 1989 He resumed his land law practice afterwards and received numerous international awards, including the Grand Cross of the Crown of Italy. He later served as Ambassador to Per√∫ during President Fernando de la R√∫a's 1999‚Äì2001 administration.

The house and gardens are run as a tourist attraction while the estate is farmed to provide additional revenue. Forde Abbey is a Grade I listed building. History Plan of the Abbey and its surroundings (1911) Between 1133-36, wealthy nobleman Richard de Brioniis built a priory on his land at Brightley (meaning \\"bright\\" or \\"clear\\" pasture) and invited Gilbert, Abbot of Waverley in Surrey, to send 12 monks to form a new Cistercian community there. One story is that the agricultural land surrounding the new priory was insufficiently fertile, forcing the monks to consider returning to the mother house in 1141. However, Adelicia de Brioniis, the sister of Richard and successor to his estate, offered them an alternative site close to the River Axe in the manor of Thorncombe. Here, between 1141‚Äì48, they built a new priory which came to be known as \\"Ford\\" due to its proximity to an old river crossing. The monastery was dedicated to the Virgin Mary.Heath, 1911, pp. 25-27. John of Ford (c. 1140 ‚Äì 21 April 1214) was the prior of Forde Abbey, then from 1186 abbot of its daughter house of Bindon, and between 1191 and 1214 the abbot of Forde. He was a friend and ally of King John during the papal interdict, receiving remuneration from the king.Josiah Cox Russell, \\"Social Status at the Court of King John,\\" Speculum, 12:3 (1937), 326. The foundation grew and became very wealthy, eventually possessing lands over by the 14th century. Sometime in the 13th Century, the body of St. Wulfric of Haselbury was buried in the western transept of the abbey's church, after an attempt by Benedictine monks from Montacute Priory to steal the body of the saint. The third abbot, Abbot Baldwin, became Archbishop of Canterbury. Abbot Chard, the last abbot of Forde at the time of the dissolution of the monasteries, surrendered the abbey to the Crown peacefully in 1539. The abbey buildings and lands were leased in 1540 to Richard Pollard (1505-1542), second son of Sir Lewis Pollard (c.1465-1526) of King's Nympton, Devon, Justice of the Common Pleas from 1514-26Hoskins, W.G., Devon, p. 337 Richard Pollard was later knighted and his son sold Forde Abbey to his relative, Sir Amias Poulet of Hinton St George, Somerset. Sir Amias and his father before him had acted as Steward of the Abbey and its property while it was a monastery. In 1580-81, Sir Amias Poulet was licensed to alienate lands belonging to that abbey to William Rosewell, the 20-year-old son of William Rosewell, Solicitor-General. Forde Abbey probably changed hands about the same time. William Rosewell of Forde died in 1593 and Forde Abbey was left to his wife Anne. Their son Henry probably took ownership on maturity in 1611. Henry became Sir Henry Rosewell of Forde in 1619. Forde Abbey was held for nearly seventy years by the Rosewells until it was sold in 1649 to Edmund Prideaux (died 1659), Member of Parliament for Lyme Regis and Treasurer of the Inner Temple, London. He supported the Parliamentary cause during the English Civil War and was the attorney-general for most of the Interregnum. He made a fortune practising law and running the Parliamentary postal service. Having purchased the property he converted the buildings into his private home,Forde Abbey website - History page with several classicising features, including the small loggia.J.J. West, in the Archaeological Journal, 140 (1983:27f) suggested that the surveyor in charge of the designs was Edward Carter (died 1663), Inigo Jones' chief deputy in the extensive repairs to St Paul's Cathedral (noted in Howard Colvin, A Biographical Dictionary of British Architects, 1600-1840, 3rd ed. 1995, s.v. \\"Carter, Edward\\"). The house remained largely unchanged during the 18th century, though the gardens were created during this period. In 1815, the house was rented to the philosopher Jeremy Bentham. During the 19th century the house had a succession of owners, some of whom neglected the house while others attempted to renovate it. In 1905, the cousin of the last owner inherited the house and moved in with her husband Freeman Roper, whose descendants still own and occupy the house and estates. House and gardens Much of the original monastery, including the abbey church was demolished in the period after the dissolution; only two statues, now on display in the Great Hall, have been found from the original church. The monastic parts of the current house are the Great Hall, the north side of the original square of the cloisters as well as the monks' accommodation, the Upper Refectory and the Undercroft, which was the abbey's working area, and the Chapter House, which has been converted into a chapel. Other rooms have been subsequently converted into State Rooms and show no evidence of their earlier use. Prideaux added some bedrooms and a reception area in the front of the building as part of his conversion of the abbey to a private house. The gardens of Forde Abbey are one of the main attractions. They are listed as Grade II* in the National Heritage List for England as a \\"historically important garden\\".Historic England National Heritage List for England, Forde Abbey, retrieved 22 September 2016 The Roper family has maintained and improved the gardens during their tenure. The gardens cover including several water features, planted gardens and an arboretum. The lawns were laid out in front of the house in the 18th century and many of the trees were planted in the 19th century. Beech House by the Great PondThe Great Pond, which was originally the head pond for a watermill, feeds a series of cascades down the hill to three smaller ponds which were a part of the gardens laid down in the 18th century.

This dedication was most evident in his acquisition and sale of the Vinland Map, and its associated manuscripts, between 1957 and 1959. Even after he had sold them to fellow Yale alumnus Paul Mellon, he was able to give a great deal of assistance to the international team (led by his friend and frequent customer, Yale librarian Thomas Marston) assigned the job of authenticating the Map, both answering their questions and volunteering suggestions over a period of years.Laurence C. Witten II, \\"Vinland's Saga Recalled\\" fromYale University Library Gazette vol. 64, no. 1-2 (1989) Laurence and Cora were keen collectors. Among their interests were early stringed musical instruments and associated items, sound recordings capturing 19th century singing styles, pre-Columbian American art, and antique automobiles. After acquiring the very large vocal recording collection of George T. Keating (co-founder of the Memorial Library of Music at Stanford University) in 1960, the Wittens made their sound archive available to scholars by depositing it at Yale University Library in 1961, forming the nucleus of the Yale Collection of Historical Sound Recordings, since greatly augmented by them and others.Karol Berger The Yale Collection of Historical Sound Recordings, Association for Recorded Sound Collections Journal, vol. 6 no. 1 (1974)Linda W.

There were no serious repercussions, however, and he continued in his rare books business, though relocated shortly afterwards to Southport, CT. He also wrote a number of scholarly papers related to his collecting interests, published in academic journals, and was co-author of a catalogue of manuscripts donated to the Beinecke Library by Paul and Mary Mellon, published in 1977.Laurence Witten et al., \\"Alchemy & the Occult: From the Collection of Paul and Mary Mellon\\", New Haven CT, Yale Beinecke Library (1977) In 1983, Laurence suffered a minor heart attack, which prompted him to offer the stringed instruments collection for sale in November of that year, at an asking price of $3 million. The Shrine to Music Museum at the University of South Dakota was keen to buy the collection, but before a funding appeal could be properly launched, the Berlin Musikinstrumentenmuseum made a preliminary offer of $2 million. Witten rejected this, and long-time Shrine sponsors Robert and Marjorie Rawlins, who had already agreed to contribute $1 million, provided the full $3 million to forestall any further foreign bids.

It is the second boat of the project, separated from the first by 16 years (1993‚Äì2009). Considerable changes were made to the initial design. Differences in the project have appeared sufficient to consider it as a new upgraded version Yasen-M (). The submarine is named after the city of Kazan. History The submarine project was developed in the Malachite Design Bureau in Saint Petersburg. The Russian navy declared that the submarine will be improved in comparison to , the first of the class. Compared to the first-of- class, Kazan will reportedly have two more VLS silos (10, compared to 8 on Severodvinsk), 2 fewer torpedo tubes (8, compared to 10 on Severodvinsk) and a pump-jet propulsor. Based on released photographs, the submarine appears to retain a conventional propeller as opposed to U.S. Virginia-class submarines which are equipped with a pump-jet propulsor. Kazans first crew had been formed in March 2016, and the submarine was originally to be commissioned in 2017. On 23 August 2016, the Sevmash shipyard reported that the submarine would be delivered to the Russian Navy in 2018. On 31 March 2017, Kazan was rolled out of the construction hall and subsequently launched on the water. It has began its sea trials on 24 September 2018 and is expected to join the Russian Navy in 2019. In October 2019, President of the United Shipbuilding Corporation Alexei Rakhmanov, stated that Kazans deployment is delayed until the end of 2020 due to technical issues with its complex control systems. Following TASS report has specified the commissioning period as \\"September- October\\" 2020. In mass culture SSGN Kazan features prominently in the Kirov novel series by John Schettler. At the end of the first season, the modern submarine battles a US task force near the Kuril Islands and then hunts down rebellious captain Karpov on board the battlecruiser Kirov. Its fictional Captain Ivan Gromyko, the Matador, appears throughout the series, with significant action in the final season covering the outbreak of WWIII in 2021.

Criticisms of the church have centred both on the nature and extent of abuse, and on historical and contemporary management of allegations by church officials. Internally, the church began updating its protocols in the 1990s, and papal apologies for abuse in Australia were made by Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI. A number of government enquiries have also examined church practices‚Äîmost notably the 2015‚Äì17 Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. The royal commission established that some 4,444 claimants alleged incidents of child sexual abuse in 4,756 reported claims to Catholic Church authorities (some claimants made a claim of child sexual abuse against more than one Catholic Church authority) and at least 1,880 suspected abusers from 1980 to 2015. Most of those suspected of abuse were Catholic priests and religious brothers and 62 percent of the survivors who told the commission they were abused in religious institutions were abused in a Catholic facility.Royal Commission: ANALYSIS OF CLAIMS OF CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MADE WITH RESPECT TO CATHOLIC CHURCH INSTITUTIONS IN AUSTRALIA ; June 2017 Australia's Catholic leaders had been among the first in the world to publicly address management of child abuse: In 1996, the church issued a document, Towards Healing, which it described as seeking to \\"establish a compassionate and just system for dealing with complaints of abuse\\". Inquiries have since established that historically, church officials had often failed to prevent future abuse by clergy who had come to their attention by transferring clergy and religious to new parishes or dioceses and not stripping them of their religious status. A widely reported 2012 claim in a Victorian police report that 43 suicide deaths were directly related to abuse by clergy spurred the formation of a Victorian state Parliamentary Inquiry into the Handling of Child Abuse by Religious and other Organisations.Victoria Police in false claim on child-abuse suicides; theaustralian.com.au; 25 July In October 2012, the Chief Commissioner of Victoria Police, Ken Lay, in a submission to a parliamentary inquiry on the issue, recommended that some of the church's actions to hinder investigations (including dissuading victims from reporting to police, failing to engage with police and alerting suspects of allegations against them) be criminalised. The Gillard Government called a wide-ranging royal commission in 2013 to examine religious and non-religious institutions and their responses to child abuse allegations. Archbishop Denis Hart, president of the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference, said he welcomed the royal commission, as did the Archbishop of Sydney, Cardinal George Pell, who said that he hoped it would help victims and stop a \\"smear campaign\\" against the church. Pell was himself later convicted of child sex offences, but was acquitted by the High Court of Australia on 7 April 2020. However, a new sex abuse investigation against Pell involving allegations which were discussed in the ABC tv special Revelation started on 13 April 2020.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/04/13/australian-police- investigating-new-child-abuse-allegations/ The Bishops Conference, established a national co-ordinating body, called the Truth, Justice and Healing Council to oversee the church's engagement with the royal commission and the pastoral and other ramifications that arose from the sexual abuse scandal. Of the 201 Catholic Church authorities surveyed by the royal commission, 92 (46%) reported having received at least one claim of child sexual abuse. Overall, some 4,444 claimants alleged incidents of abuse in 4,756 reported claims over the period 1950‚Äì2015 (86% of claims related to pre-1990 incidents). The 3,057 claims resulting in a payment for redress amounted to $268 million between 1980 and 2015. Alleged perpetrators were overwhelmingly male (90%) and religious brothers were disproportionally highly responsible (having the most claimants and some 37% of all alleged perpetrators, despite being numerically inferior to priests and religious sisters). By means of a weighted index, the commission found that at 75 archdioceses/dioceses and religious institutes with priest members examined, some 7 per cent of priests (who worked in Australia between 1950 and 2009) were alleged perpetrators (this finding did not represent allegations tested in a court of law). Senior Counsel Gail Furness told the commission that \\"Children were ignored or worse, punished. Allegations were not investigated. Priests and religious leaders were moved. The parishes or communities to which they were moved knew nothing of their past. Documents were not kept or they were destroyed.\\" By August 2011, according to Broken Rites, a support and advocacy group for church-related sex abuse victims, there had been over 100 cases in Australia where Catholic priests had been charged for sex offences against minors, as well as others involving non-custodial sentences and inconclusive proceedings. On 3 June 2019, 18 months after being ordered to do so by the country's Royal Commission into Institutional Child Sexual Abuse, the Australian Catholic Church published its National Catholic Safeguarding Standards. The standards closely parallel the commission's recommendations as well as norms enshrined by the government in the National Principles for Child Safe Organizations, although some provisions were watered down. One notable alteration concerned the number of hours per year that people should be undergoing professional and pastoral supervision, which was reduced from the recommended 12 hours to six hours. On 7 May 2020, newly released portions of the Royal Commission into Institutional Child Sexual Abuse's report stated that Pell knew about sex abuse in Catholic church as early as 1973.https://www.businessinsider.com/george-pell-knew- child-sex-abuse-catholic-church-royal-commission-2020-5On May 8, 2020, the Australian Supreme Court established an Institutional Liability List to administer child sex abuse lawsuits The list includes claims for damages arising from the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. The Royal Commission's allegations against George Pell and the Roman Catholic Diocese of Ballarat played a role in the creation of the list. In September 2020, the Australian state of Queensland passed legislation which makes it so religious institutions, such as the Catholic church, and their members are no longer able to use the sanctity of confession as a defence against failing to report material information about the sexual abuse of children.https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-09-08/queensland-law-jail-priests- not-reporting-child-sex- confessions/12642144https://www.mondaq.com/australia/crime/983758/queensland- to-force-priests-to-report-child-sexual-abuse Under the new Queensland law, clergy who refuse to report confessions of sex abuse will face a maximum sentence of three years in prison. Cases=Archdiocese of Adelaide= On 13 September 2011, Senator Nick Xenophon used parliamentary privilege to name an Adelaide priest as the alleged perpetrator of six sexual assaults on John Hepworth about 50 years earlier. Senator Xenophon alleged that the vicar- general of the Adelaide archdiocese, Monsignor David Cappo, had been provided with detailed allegations in 2008 but had failed to act upon them, the investigations still being \\"at a preliminary stage\\" and the priest concerned not being stood down during the investigation. Monsignor Cappo subsequently resigned from several governmental positions. The Catholic Church established a formal independent inquiry, conducted by Michael Abbott, , found that there was no substance to the allegations. Father Albert Davis (d. 2007), a member of the Dominican order, was charged in 2006 with 17 incidents of indecent assault involving seven boys at Blackfriars Priory School between 1956 and 1960. Davis was committed to stand trial in the Adelaide District Court, but he died before proceedings were commenced. Father Charles Barnett pleaded guilty in 2009 (after extradition from Indonesia) to three child sex charges for events between 1977 and 1985 at Crystal Brook and Port Pirie. =Archdiocese of Sydney= In 2007, Ross Murrin, 52, a former Sydney Catholic school teacher and Marist Brother, accused of indecently assaulting eight male Year 5 students at a Daceyville school in south-east Sydney in 1974, pleaded guilty to some of the 21 charges. In 2016, Fr Roger Flaherty received a sentence of two years and two weeks in prison five months after pleading guilty to molesting three altar boys in the 1970s and 1980s. However, Flaherty's advanced age and poor health allowed him to be eligible for parole six months into his sentence. Former Sydney archbishop Cardinal James Freeman and auxiliary bishop Edward Kelly were accused of shielding Flaherty from prosecution when the acts of sex abuse were committed. In 2017, Fr Denis Chrysostom Alexander was arrested in Sydney and faces an extradition to Scotland for sexual and physical abuse he reportedly committed at the former Fort Augustus Abbey in the 1970s. The sex abuse investigation against Alexander also resulted in the Archdiocese of Sydney stripping him being of his priestly faculties in Australia by 2013 as well. In 2018, the Archbishop of Sydney, Cardinal George Pell, was convicted of child sex offences, but was acquitted by the High Court of Australia in 2020. In April 2019, Fr Anthony Caruana was arrested and charged with sexually abusing five minors, including one male minor, between the years 1982 and 1988 when he was a dormitory manager, rugby coach and band teacher at Chevalier College. Marist Brothers In February 2020, convicted Marist Brother William Wade, who served as principal of five Australian Marist Brother-run high schools, plead guilty to also concealing the abuse from authorities.https://www.newcastleherald.com.au/story/6652445/history-after- marist-brother-pleads-guilty-to-concealing-serious-child-sex-crimes/ Diocese of Armidale This diocese incorporates 25 parishes and 24 schools within about 90,000 km2 and is clearly, one of, if not the highest density locations of Catholic Child Sexual Abuse in Australia on a per capita basis. The extraordinary and shocking story of 'Father F', later to be identified as former Armidale local, and former Catholic Priest John Joseph Farrell, was central to the ABC Television program Four Corners expose \\"Unholy Silence\\". This was first broadcast on Monday 2 July 2012 and was potentially the final trigger that led to the then prime minister, Julia Gillard, announcing the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. The reaction of Armidale locals to the program was strong and one of indignation that something should have been done sooner by the Catholic Church. Case Study 44 of the Royal Commission (Held Monday 19 to Thursday 22 September 2016) focused specifically on this case of a former Catholic priest abusing children over a 20-year period and the alleged cover-up by the church hierarchy including Father Bernard Flood, Father Richard Gleeson, Monsignor Wayne Peters (dec), Father Brian Lucas, Monsignor John Usher, Bishop Gerard Hanna (ret), Bishop Bede Heather (ret), Bishop Luc Matthys (most of whom gave evidence to the Royal Commission) and even Australia's most senior Catholic, Cardinal George Pell. On 1 November 2019, former Diocese of Armidale priest David Perrett plead not guilty to 139 charges of child sexual assault at a number of locations, including Armidale, Guyra, Walgett, Moree, Penrith, Bundarra, Lower Creek and Sawtell between the 1960s and 1990s.https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-01/former-priest-pleads-not-guilty- to-sex-charges/11664202 Perrett, aged 82, had been arrested for these charges and was denied bail in August 2018,https://www.northerndailyleader.com.au/story/5601642/81yo-retired-priest- refused-bail-on-historical-sex-abuse-charges/ but was later granted bail in April 2019 after he was told he had only six months to a year to live.https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/a-spent-volcano-old-ill-former- priest-bailed-on-131-charges-20190409-p51cip.html In February 2020, it was ruled that Perrett would stand trial starting 18 January 2021.https://www.tenterfieldstar.com.au/story/6644899/trial-set-for-former- new-england-priest-accused-of-historical-sex-abuse-charges/ Diocese of Maitland-Newcastle The diocese has been referred to as the \\"epicentre of Catholic clerical sexual abuse in Australia\\" due to a number of paedophile priests with extensive abuse records being jailed since 1997, a dedicated clergy abuse police strikeforce (Strike Force Lantle) having laid more than 170 abuse charges. Convicted abusers include Father Vincent Ryan (a $6 million compensation payout to victims, setting a record for the Catholic Church in Australia), Father David O'Hearn (serving a 23-year sentence) and Father James Fletcher (died in jail in 2006). John Sidney Denham pleaded guilty to 29 child sex charges involving 27 boys under his care while a priest in Newcastle in the 1970s. It was alleged that the Archbishop of Adelaide, Philip Wilson, knew about clerical sexual abuse when serving in the New South Wales' diocese of Maitland-Newcastle in the late 1970s and 1980s. On 27 July 2012, John Pirona was found dead in his car five days after leaving a letter ending \\"too much pain\\", this referring to his abuse by a paedophile priest in 1979 when Pirona was 12, the event occurring a year after Maitland-Newcastle bishop Leo Clarke was informed that the priest was a sex offender. On 31 July 2012, NSW Police in Strike Force Lantle announced they would be providing prosecutors with evidence that Father Brian Lucas, general secretary of the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference, Archbishop Wilson of Adelaide and Michael Malone, retired Bishop of Maitland-Newcastle, had committed the offence of concealing a serious crime under s316 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) in concealing child sexual abuse by the priest Denis McAlinden (now deceased) in the Maitland- Newcastle diocese. The evidence includes an admission by then Maitland- Newcastle bishop, Leo Clarke, to McAlinden that \\"your good name will be protected by the confidential nature of the process\\" despite \\"your admission to Father Brian Lucas and other evidence\\" and a letter from the late Maitland- Newcastle monsignor Patrick Cotter to Bishop Clarke that McAlinden \\"feels no such inclination towards mature females but towards the little ones. I have never heard of this condition before and knowing Father McAlinden as we do, we do not think it can be real serious.\\" In November 2012 the Premier of New South Wales, Barry O'Farrell, ordered a special commission of inquiry into allegations of sexual abuse by Catholic clergy in this diocese and whether the church had hindered police investigations. Presided over by Margaret Cunneen , she reported her findings to the Governor of New South Wales, Marie Bashir, on 30 May 2014. On 22 May 2018, the Newcastle Local Court found Wilson guilty of the charge of failing to report allegations of child sexual abuse by Fletcher in 1976. Wilson was given a maximum sentence of 12 months in detention for concealing child sexual abuse in the 1970s. On 6 December 2018, Wilson was acquitted of all the charges of which he had previously been found guilty. The Director of Public Prosecutions had been reported to be considering a challenge in the Supreme Court of New South Wales but on 20 December, announced that there were no reasonable prospects of success of appeal on errors of law. On 15 February 2017 it was reported that the Catholic Church in Australia had secretly paid the equivalent of $276.1 million in compensation to thousands of people sexually abused as children by priests and religious brothers. Between 1980 and 2015, the Christian Brothers, which operated a number of residential facilities, made the highest number of payments at 763, totaling $48.5 million. Most reported incidents of sex abuse occurred between 1950 and 1989. Some reported incidents occurred as early as the 1920s and the latest after 2010. In May 2019, Fr Vincent Gerald Ryan, who had previously served 14 years in jail for sex abusing for abusing 34 boys from 1973 to 1991, was jailed for at least 14 months for sex abuse he committed against two altar boys during this timeframe which were not prosecuted. Diocese of Wagga Wagga In 2002, Vincent Kieran Kiss, 70, pleaded guilty in the Sydney District Court for sex crimes against four teenage boys, aged 13 to 17, between 1966 and 1973 at locations including Albury, Yass and Sydney. Kiss was the Diocesan Director of Youth in Wagga Wagga at the time of the offences and the four victims were members of the Young Christian Students Association. Diocese of Wollongong In 1993, the Illawarra Mercury alleged that Gwynneville parish priest Father Peter Lewis Comensoli and Brother Michael Evans had been involved in the sexual abuse of boys. Comensoli was jailed and was later named during the Wood Royal Commission. Evans committed suicide. In 1996 Father John Gerard Nestor was charged with the 1991 indecent assault of a 15-year-old altar boy. Nestor was initially convicted by a Local Court magistrate and sentenced to a 16-month gaol term which was overturned on an \\"all points\\" appeal to the District Court. The case ended suddenly when prosecution witnesses were caught in contradictions, Judge Phelen stating that the supposed victim seemed to have difficulty \\"distinguishing fact from imagination\\". Nestor went on to work as a priest for a number of years in senior appointments. After engaging in secular employment he was laicised in 2009. The former Australian prime minister and leader of the Australian Liberal Party, Tony Abbott, provided a character reference for Nestor's trial describing him as \\"an upright and virtuous man whom he had known since 1984 while studying at Sydney's St Patrick's Seminary to become a priest\\". The Illawarra Mercury reported lawyer Chris Murphy suggesting that the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse investigate the case of Nestor. In 2010, Kelvin Gerald Sharkey, 83, was sentenced in the Wollongong District Court to at least 15 months' jail for sexually abusing an altar boy on three occasions between 1969 and 1975 when Sharkey was parish priest of St John Vianney's Church at Fairy Meadow and at St Bernard's Church at Batemans Bay. In 2017, Marist Brother and former principal of the Mary Immaculate Catholic Parish Primary School in the Sydney suburb of Eagle Vale, plead guilty to four counts of sexually abusing a minor. In 2018, Bishop Peter Ingham issued an apology and acknowledged the history of sex abuse at various Catholic schools in the Diocese of Wollongong. In March 2019, Father Ron Peters, who was formerly listed as the \\"Dean and Adiministrator\\" of the Diocese of Wollongong, was charged with sex abuse. Diocese of Bathurst St Stanislaus College Bathurst in the 1970s and 1980s was referred to by an anonymous former student as a \\"pedophile paradise\\" due to the abusive activities of priests there. William Stanley Irwin, 55, for instance, a former Catholic brother, was convicted on 31 March 2011 by a jury in the Sydney District Court on two counts of gross indecency on a male under the age of 18 at St Stanislaus' College in Bathurst in the mid-1980s. Having been asked by the boy's parents to counsel him in relation to prior sexual abuse, Irwin kissed the youth and initiated mutual masturbation when the pair stayed at the boarding school overnight during a road trip in 1986. Irwin was later a dormitory master at St Stanislaus' for two years and a chaplain and teacher at St Aloysius' College at Milsons Point. Kevin Francis Phillips, similarly, pleaded guilty in a Sydney District Court on 3 December 2010 to four counts of gross indecency with a child under the age of 18. Phillips was sentenced on 21 April 2011 to a total of 15 months' jail. On the first three counts, he was sentenced to a concurrent term of nine months starting on 21 April 2011 and expiring on 20 January 2012. On the final charge of gross indecency by a male with a male under 18 years, Phillips was sentenced to a term of nine months to start on 21 October 2011 and expiring on 20 July 2012 with a non-parole period of three months. Brian Joseph Spillane also was convicted on 30 November 2010 on nine counts of indecent assault against three girls aged between eight and seventeen while he was based in Sydney in about 1979, a Vincentian priest at that time. During bail proceedings it was heard that Spillane faced a further 135 charges relating to alleged offences against boys at St Stanislaus' College whilst Spillaine was chaplain. These latter charges were expected to be heard in four more trials that were expected to last until late 2011. Spillaine was refused bail. After a court-ordered media blackout was lifted, in place since 2013, it was reported in 2016 that Spillane was convicted of assaults on five St Stanislaus' College students after a trial in 2013, and in 2015 he pleaded guilty to assaults on four boys at the school in the late 1980s. It was reported that during 2016 Spillane was convicted of attacks on five students between 1974 and 1990. Spillane, who is currently in custody, was sentenced in February 2017 to an additional nine years in prison, and is not eligible for parole.  Diocese of Parramatta  In 1992, after allegations arose that a priest had been sexually abusing some of his parishioners, a meeting was held between the accused priest and three senior members of clergy. As a result of the meeting the priest was banned from conducting Mass, but was otherwise permitted to continue serving as a priest. The priest was laicised in 2005. In 2012, allegations arose through the Four Corners television program that the priest admitted to child sexual abuse at the 1992 meeting, and that the senior clergy present chose not to report the allegations to police. Cardinal George Pell subsequently denied that the priest admitted to sexual abuse at the meeting. In February 2010, Fr Robert MacGregor Fuller began serving a 6-to-18-month sentence months after pleading guilty to sending both a sexually lurid video broadcast of himself and sexually lurid text messages to a 13-year-old girl in the summer of 2009. =Archdiocese of Melbourne= The Chief Commissioner of Victoria Police, in a submission to a parliamentary inquiry established in April 2012, stated that Melbourne archdiocese's Melbourne Response process, under which victims may not be legally represented appeared to \\"be a de facto substitute for criminal justice\\" that was detrimental to prosecuting suspected sexual criminals. He noted that though the Melbourne Response states on its website that in the past 14 years the church has compensated 300 people as victims of sexual abuse and identified 86 offenders of whom 60 were priests, not one complainant was referred to Victoria Police. The report stated that the process of moving offenders to other positions in the church restricted capacity to bring them to account and promoted a culture of secrecy that hindered more victims speaking out. The Melbourne Response's system, the report states, has outdated process that include requiring victims to confront alleged offenders. Notable cases have included: Michael Charles Glennon‚Äîsentenced to 22 years' jail with a non-parole period of 15 years for 23 offences against children, including rape, indecent assault, gross indecency, sexually penetrating a child under the age of 16 and sexually penetrating a child under the age of 10; David Daniel‚Äîsentenced to six years' jail with a non-parole period of four years and six months for molesting four boys, a girl and an adult male; and Wilfred James Baker‚Äîsentenced to four years in prison (parole after 2 years) for 16 counts of indecent assault and one of gross indecency, involving eight boys, aged 10 to 13, over a 20-year period between 1960 and 1979. Three priests, Michael Aulsebrook, Frank Klep and David Rapson, were investigated and prosecuted for sexual abuse which took place at Rupertswood College Sunbury in the 1990s. Rapson was jailed in 2013 for at least 13 years, with the possibility of parole after 10 years, for molesting 8 students at a Catholic school in Melbourne between 1973 and 1990. Kelp was jailed for ten-and-a-half years in 2014 after he pleaded guilty to 15 sex offences involving many boys, including siblings at the school aged between 11 and 15, between the 1970s and 1980s and will be eligible for parole six-and-a-half years into his sentence. Aulsebrook, who was convicted in a retrial, received a sentence on seven-and- a-half years in 2018 for raping a 12-year-old boy at the Salesian College boarding school in 1988 and will be eligible for parole four and half years in his sentence. Brother Tanson was found to have sexually abused Amber Louise while she resided at a Christian Brothers orphanage in Victoria in the 1970s.https://www.childabuseroyalcommission.gov.au/narratives/amber-louises- story Despite belonging to a different order, Tanson was allowed to visit the orphanage on a regular basis. Tanson and an associate who was a Christian Brother were accused of abusing other children at the orphanage as well, though Louise\\"s case was the only one which was proven. Former Melbourne archbishop and former high ranking Roman Curia official Cardinal George Pell was sent to jail on 27 February 2019, two months after being convicted of molesting two choir boys. Judge Peter Kidd sentenced Pell on 13 March 2019 to serve six years in jail, with three years and eight months' non-parole period. In August 2019, the Victorian Court of Appeal rejected Pell's appeal to have his convictions overturned. Pell then sought leave to have the matter heard in the High Court; however, he did serve all 405 days of his required prison sentence. On 7 April 2020, Pell won his appeal with the Australian High Court and was soon afterwards released from prison after serving 13 months of his six year prison sentence. On 11 April 2020, Pell stated in an interview with Sky News journalist Andrew Bolt, which aired on Sky News Australia on 14 April 2020, that he was \\"ashamed\\" of the way the Catholic Church dealt with sex abuse cases.https://www.skynews.com.au/details/_6148718483001https://thewest.com.au/news/religion- and-belief/explosive-comments-cardinal-george-pell-says-paedophilia-a-cancer- within-catholic-church-he-is-ashamed-of-how-it-dealt-with-sex-abuse- ng-b881516798z He maintained his innocence and suggested that the alleged victim had been \\"used\\".\\"George Pell tells Andrew Bolt the man who testified against him may have been used\\", The Guardian, 14 April 2020. On 16 April 2020, the Richmond Football Club denied Pell the right to be reinstated as the club's Vice-Patron and ambassador.https://www.theaustralian.com.au/subscribe/news/1/?sourceCode=TAWEB_WRE170_a_GGL&dest;=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theaustralian.com.au%2Fnation%2Fgeorge- pell-wont-be-reinstated-as-vice-patron-says-richmond%2Fnews- story%2Fbabb70f2dc1a888175dc211c04dd1733&memtype;=anonymous&mode;=premiumhttps://www.heraldsun.com.au/subscribe/news/1/?sourceCode=HSWEB_WRE170_a_GGL&dest;=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.heraldsun.com.au%2Fnews%2Fvictoria%2Frichmond- tigers-wont-reinstate-george-pells-club-ambassador-role-following- acquittal%2Fnews- story%2F982fe7ebe425d92fd6ab134d4c7454b1&memtype;=anonymous&mode;=premiumhttps://www.thechronicle.com.au/news/tigers- wont-reinstate-pell-as-club-ambassador/3996298/ On 27 April 2020 the Archdiocese of Melbourne issued an apology for shielding Father Gerard Mulvale, who had sexually abused a girl named Stephanie Piper on at least eight occasions between 1975 and 1979.https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-04-27/woman-wins-catholic-church- apology-for-1970s-abuse-of-daughter/12173506 An investigation against Mulvale later started in 1993, during which the Archdiocese of Melbourne denied his guilt. In January 1994 Stephanie committed suicide at the age of 32. However, Mulvale was eventually convicted in November 1995 of sexually abusing two boys. Stephanie's mother Eileen Piper has along been engaged in legal action against the Archdiocese of Melbourne as well. On 6 May 2020 it was revealed that previously undisclosed portions of the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse report found Pell had shielded former Archdiocese of Melbourne priest Peter Searson from potential prosecution after the Catholic Church in Australia secretly concluded that he sexually abused children.https://www.theaustralian.com.au/subscribe/news/1/?sourceCode=TAWEB_WRE170_a_GGL&dest;=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theaustralian.com.au%2Fnation%2Finquirys- edits-not-flattering-for-george-pell%2Fnews- story%2F366c9cea3b080a7cb8779806b63e9ff4&memtype;=anonymous&mode;=premium It had been previously revealed in 2014 that the Catholic Church in Australia concluded in 1997 that Searson sexually abused both boys and girls when he was teaching at Holy Family Parish Primary School in Doveton in Melbourne's south- east.https://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-11-25/details-of-pell-apology-to-victim- of-paedophile-priest-released/6972448https://rctlaw.com.au/legal- blog/2015/frustration-over-response-to-abuse-at-melbourne-catholic-school However, the results of the Catholic Church's investigation were not released to the public and Searson died in 2009 before he could face a criminal trial. In 2014, Helen Last, the former director of the Archdiocese of Melbourne's pastoral response office, claimed that in 1997, Pell blocked her from during more to investigate the claims against Searson, telling her in letter \\"under control\\" and \\"there remains no need for any pro-active measures from your office,\\" and then was removed her from her post one month later after she defied his order. The newly disclosed details, which were made public on 7 May 2020, also revealed that while he was serving as an Auxiliary Bishop of Melbourne, Pell knew that Searson not only sexually abused students at his school, but, as early as 1989, also ignored complaints that showed signs of Searson's aggressive behavior, such as his use of children's toilets and making his students watch him torture animals. The newly disclosed portions of the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse report, which was originally published in redacted form in December 2017, also revealed that priests and clergy staff accused of abusing children within the Archdiocese of Melbourne were sometimes \\"dealt with\\" by being transferred to other parishes. Diocese of Ballarat The Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse final report published on 15 December 2017 found that 139 people made a claim of child sexual abuse to the Diocese of Ballarat between 1980 and 2015 and that there was 21 alleged perpetrators identified in claims. Of the 21 alleged and convicted perpetrators 17 were priests which is 8.7% of the priests who ministered during this period. The royal commission's final report of Catholic Church authorities in Ballarat was released on 6 December 2017. The commission found that Bishop Ronald Mulkearns had failed to take action, saying that \\"Bishop Mulkearns again was derelict in his duty in failing to take any effective action to have (infamous paedophile Gerald) Ridsdale referred to police and to restrict Ridsdale's contact with children.\\" The commission pointed out to the structure of the diocese, culture and governance, concluding that \\"The most likely explanation for the conduct of Bishop Mulkearns and other senior clergy in the Diocese was that they were trying to minimise the risk of scandal and protect the reputation of the Catholic Church.\\" The Melbourne report found that Peter Connors, a former Bishop of Ballarat, was part of a culture that practiced \\"using oblique or euphemistic language in correspondence and records concerning complaints of child sexual abuse\\". Below are some extracts from the conclusion of the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse's report into Case Study 28‚ÄîCatholic Church authorities in Ballarat: > This case study exposed a catastrophic failure in the leadership of the > Diocese and ultimately in the structure and culture of the Church over > decades to effectively respond to the sexual abuse of children by its > priests. That failure led to the suffering and often irreparable harm to > children, their families and the wider community. That harm could have been > avoided if the Church had acted in the interests of children rather than in > its own interests. > Euphemistic and elliptical language was often used in correspondence and > minutes to mask the true nature of the conduct discussed. There was repeated > reference to 'pressures', 'strains' and unspecified 'problems'. On > occasions, records were deliberately not made or kept or were destroyed. > The result of these inexcusable failures was that more children were > sexually abused by Catholic clergy in the Diocese. There was a catastrophic > institutional failure which resulted in many children being sexually abused. > We heard about the devastating, often lifelong, consequences in the lives of > those children. The welfare of children was not the primary concern of > Bishop Mulkearns and other senior members of the Diocese when responding to > complaints and allegation of child sexual abuse against their priests. There > is no doubt it should have been. The report on Ballarat also described the impact it had on victims. One section outlines suicide and premature death caused from the abuse. One victim said > Newspapers don't report suicides, so the public doesn't hear about the > broken families and their shattered lives, about the unseen impact of > institutional child sexual abuse. Children are left behind and they don't > understand why. It doesn't end when the abuse ends. Other harms are outlined. Another victim outlines the general harm in the Ballarat community: > Such chronic sexual abuse in the Ballarat community has led to a large > number of men who are not able to be productive members of society and in > neglect have become either emotional, social or financial burdens upon the > community. One victim who told their story to the Royal Commission was Paul Levey was sent to live with Ridsdale at the age of 14 at the presbytery in Mortlake. The Levey said he was \\"sexually abused all the time just about every day\\" and the Commission heard evidence that Ronald Mulkearns was among a number of clergy who knew Ridsdale had a boy living with him, but failed to intervene. The commission found that Mulkearns \\"ignored\\" pleas from Paul Levey's mother who was \\"concerned about the situation and sought his assistance\\" even though \\"By this time, Bishop Mulkearns knew of Ridsdale's admission of offending against boys.\\" The Commission stated that Bishop Mulkearns' response to Paul Levey living with Ridsdale in the Mortlake presbytery \\"demonstrated a total absence of concern for the welfare of that boy\\". The Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse found that the then Bishop of Ballarat Diocese, James O'Collins, had received a complaint in the 1960s that Father Gerald Ridsdale had sexually abused a boy but did not take action. The royal commission was also told Bishop Ronald Mulkearns knew in 1975 that Ridsdale had abused boys and again did nothing to stop the abuse from occurring. A priest, Gerald Ridsdale, was jailed in 1994 for 18 years, with a minimum of 15 years, after pleading guilty to 46 counts of child sexual offences, including buggery, indecent assault and gross indecency, committed over two decades on 21 victims. In 2006, he pleaded guilty to 35 additional charges relating to indecent assault against 10 boys. On these charges, he was sentenced to 13 years' imprisonment, with a minimum of seven years. A few of his victims criticised the sentence. Ridsdale would have been eligible for parole in August 2013, at the age of 79. On 20 June 2013, Ridsdale was again charged by Victoria Police with an additional 84 offences against 14 victims committed between 1961 and 1981. He pleaded guilty to 29 counts (27 of indecent assault, one count of buggery and one count of carnal knowledge of a girl under the age of 16) committed between 1960 and 1980 and asked for a further 27 counts to be taken into consideration at sentencing, which will take place at a date to be fixed. After pleading guilty to the above charges, including raping and abusing children as young as four, Ridsdale was sentenced to eight years in prison in April 2014 and was scheduled to be eligible for parole in April 2019. The latest charges bring the tally of Ridsdale's confirmed victims to 54. In May 2015 Ridsdale gave an account of his offending in evidence to the Royal Commission on Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse.J. Franklin, Gerald Ridsdale, pedophile priest, in his own words, Journal of the Australian Catholic Historical Society 36 (2105), 219‚Äì230. However, his ineligibility for parole was eventually extended. Ridsdale pleaded guilty to a further 20 offences against 10 boys and a girl on 13 April 2017. These offences were committed between 1961 and 1988 in western Victoria and were expected to extend his release date further into the future. On 15 August 2017 Ridsdale pleaded guilty to 23 charges including two counts of rape and one of buggery, for abusing 12 children, 11 boys and one girl with ages ranging from 6 to 13, between 1962 and 1988 in the Victoria state city of Ballarat and the surrounding area. On 14 May 2020 Victorian County Court Judge Gerard Mullaly extended Ridsdale's non-parole period, which was originally scheduled to end in 2022, by another two years to 2024.https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/australian-pedophile-priest-sentenced-to- more-jail-time-1.4938897 On 8 August 2011 Robert Charles Best, a Christian Brother, was sentenced in the Victorian County Court to 14 years and nine months' jail, with a non-parole period of 11 years and three months, for 27 offences involving sexual abuse of 11 boys. Best taught at Catholic primary and secondary schools in Ballarat, Box Hill and Geelong (all in Victoria, Australia) between the 1960s and 1980s. Best has been convicted by a jury and has pleaded guilty to more than 40 child sex offences against dozens of students, some as young as eight years old. Best had not been expelled by the Christian Brothers and the order had expended more than 1 million on his legal costs. In May 2013, the Christian Brothers admitted to Victoria's parliamentary inquiry into child abuse they did what they could to defend members accused of sexual assault against children. They admitted to hiring a private investigator to follow one of Best's victims. In addition to paying the aforementioned legal costs, the church also paid hundreds of thousands to defend other members also accused of rape. On 21 August 2019 Ballarat's Bishop Paul Bird acknowledged that Pell, who had lost his appeal in the state of Victoria, had ties to this Melbourne suffragan diocese and apologised for the history of sex abuse in the diocese as well. On 6 September 2019 the Diocese of Ballarat released a statement admitting that the high-ranking clergy in the diocese knew of sex abuse claims against Gerald Ridsdale and afterwards made efforts to shield Ridsdale from prosecution. This confession came in the wake of civil lawsuit filed against thedDiocese by one of Ridsdale's victims. In addition to the Archdiocese of Melbourne sex abuse charges, Pell also faces numerous sex abuse charges stemming from his time in the Diocese of Ballarat. The three-episode miniseries Revelation, which aired on ABC TV on 17 March 31 March and 2 April 2020,https://www.abc.net.au/radio/programs/abc-news- specials/episode-3/12114314 revealed two men, identified as Bernie and Peter Clarke, who accused Pell of sexually abusing them as boys when he served at the Catholic-run orphanage where they resided in the 1970s.https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-04-02/george-pell-ballarat-allegations- revelation/12109952 The new sex abuse allegations against Pell were also investigated by Australian journalist Sarah Ferguson.https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-04-02/george-pell-ballarat- allegations-revelation/12109952 Despite the fact that his sex abuse convictions related to his time in the Archdiocese of Melbourne were later overturned, Pell still faces 10 civil lawsuits, with some stemming from his time in the Diocese of Ballarathttps://cruxnow.com/vatican/2020/04/vatican- welcomes-pell-verdict-affirms-anti-abuse-resolve-as-survivors- protest/https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/mar/04/george-pell-to- be-sued-over-alleged-1970s-sexual-abuse-in-ballarat The overturn of Pell's Melbourne conviction also did not prevent the Australian Broadcast Corporation (ABC) from releasing a statement defending the accuracy of Revelation, stating that \\"The ABC has‚Äîand will continue to‚Äîreport accurately and without fear or favour on stories that are in the public interest, including this one.\\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/09/abc-to-re-edit-and-restore- george-pell-episode-of-revelation-as-news-corp-goes-on-attack Despite the fact that the third episode was temporarily removed from online reruns, it will be restored after undergoing some re-editing to update the content; all three episodes also remain available on ABC Radio's website.https://www.abc.net.au/radio/programs/abc-news- specials/episode-3/12114314 In his interview with Bolt, Pell stated that failures to act on the abuse, which he referred to as \\"cancer\\", still haunted him. On 13 April 2020, the Revelation allegations developed into a new sex abuse investigation against Pell. Robert Patrick Claffey, a priest, pleaded guilty in 1998 to indecent assault of two boys aged 12 and 13 after their sister died in a road accident in 1978. In 2014, he was also charged with 16 counts of indecent assault and one count of buggery against about seven child victims between 1970 and 1992. In October, 2016, he pleaded guilty to the offences and was jailed for 18 years. On May 8, 2020, it was revealed that Claffey was still serving a prison term for the sexual abuse of 14 children between 1969 and 1992, and that at least one of his victims, Joseph Barrett, was granted a settlement of $35,000 after filing a lawsuit against the Diocese of Ballarat. On 6 May 2020 it was revealed that the newly disclosed portions of the Royal Commission report found that Pell had attempted to protect Ridsdale from potential prosecution by transferring him when he was a vicar of the Diocese of Ballarat. Pell had also confessed to the Commission that \\"didn't do anything about it\\" when a young schoolboy told him that Brother Edward Dowlan was sexually abusing him, but also tried to hide the fact that it was also in part his duty to assist in the investigation.https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/06/george- pell-sections-of-child-abuse-royal-commission-report-to-be-published-on- thursday According to the report's newly disclosed details, which were made public on 7 May 2020, by 1973 Pell was \\"not only conscious of child sexual abuse by clergy but that he also had considered measures of avoiding situations which might provoke gossip about it.\\" On 7 May 2020 the portions of the Royal Commission report involving Pell were made public and revealed that the Commission found that Pell knew about the abuse committed by Ridsdale and deliberately attempted to cover it up when he took part in the College of Consultors decision to transfer Ridsdale from the Mortlake parish in Ballarat to Sydney in 1982. The Commission rejected Pell's claim that he was deceived when he cast his vote to transfer Ridsdale as \\"implausible.\\" It was also reported that Pell attempted to bribe Ridsdale's nephew David Ridsdale, who was also sexually abused by Gerald, into keeping quiet.https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/07/george-pell- cardinal-was-aware-of-children-being-sexually-abused-royal-commission-report- reveals David testified to the Royal Commission that the attempted bribe took place when he told Pell about the sex abuse over the phone in February 1983.https://www.smh.com.au/national/pell-knew-in-1982-that-ridsdale-was- moved-to-save-church-from-scandal-20200507-p54qr9.html David stated that after he brought up the abuse \\"[Pell] then began to talk about my growing family and my need to take care of their needs,\\" and that \\"He mentioned how I would soon have to buy a car or house for my family.\\" David's sisters Patricia Ridsdale and Bernadette Lukaitis also backed his account, telling the royal commission that their brother called them shortly after his conversation with Pell and said Pell had tried to bribe him. Despite not being satisfied with how David interpreted Pell's offer, which was believed to be mere assistance rather than an offer of silence, the Royal Commission accepted that Pell \\"turned his mind\\" to Ridsdale taking his boy victims on overnight camps. Accusations against Pell, Ridsdale and Claffey also played a major role in the Australian Supreme Court's decision to create the Instiutional Liability List on 8 May 2020. The list will administer child sex abuse lawsuits nationwide. =Marist Brothers= In September 2018, Marist Brother Gerard McNamara, 80, was sentenced to nine months in prison for molesting five boys who were aspiring athletes at St Paul's Catholic College, where served as principal, in Traralgon between 1970 and 1975. He also molested one of these boy 30 times. In June 2019, the Marist Brothers produced a list of 154 members who were accused of sexually abusing children in Australia between 1980 and 2015. In May 2020, McNamara began serving his second stint in prison after pleading guilty to charges of indecent assault and one count of common assault of more than 15 male students between 1970 and 1975.https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-05-15/catholic-brother-nicknamed-the- rat-sentenced-to-jail-for-sex/12252922 This time, he received a sentence of 35 months in prison, with 28 months suspended. Since his first sex abuse conviction in June 2006, which resulted in a suspended prison sentence, McNamara, who was also nicknamed \\"The Rat,\\" has received three additional convictions and sentences on sex abuse charges, but was able to once again receive a suspended prison sentence following another conviction in December 2016. =Archdiocese of Brisbane= In June 2010, Brisbane priest Michael Ambrose Endicott plead guilty to take indecent photos of two schoolboys between 1977 and 1978 and received a one-year suspended prison sentence. In March 2019, he received an 18-month prison sentence after being convicted of making boys strip nude for photos during the 1970s and 1980s, only to have this conviction overturned the next month. Diocese of Townsville Notable cases include: Neville Joseph Creen, who molested young girls while he served as a priest at Mount Isa, north-west Queensland, from 1973 to 1981. In Brisbane District Court on 12 September 2003, Creen (aged 63) was sentenced to three-and-half years' jail with a 14-month minimum after admitting to 34 indecent dealing charges involving 18 girls under the age of 13. One girl was aged just 5 when Creen abused her at a youth camp and later at the home of her grandparents. Creen pleaded guilty to a further six charges on 4 November 2004 and was sentenced to an additional two years' jail. =Archdiocese of Perth= In 1995, Gerard William Dick, a self-confessed sexually abusive priest, was sentenced to three-and-a-half years' jail for 10 incidents of indecently dealing with boys aged between 8 and 10 at a Christian Brothers' orphanage in Western Australia. David Christian was fined 10,500 on seven charges of indecently assaulting boys at the Marist Brothers school. In 1994, the Parliament of Western Australia was presented a petition with 30,000 signatures which demanded an inquiry into the sexual and physical assault that took place in various institutions run by the Christian Brothers including Castledare Boys' Home, Bindoon, Clontarf and Tardun. The Christian Brothers accepted that there was strong evidence that many of the allegations were true, and made a public apology. A legal action brought by over 200 former students ran from 1993 in the New South Wales Supreme Court and was finalised in 1996 with an out of court settlement. In 2014, retired Subiaco and Shenton Park priest Patrick Holmes was sentenced to three years' jail. He had pled guilty to six child-sex charges dating between 1969 and 1981. He later appeared in court in 2018 and again in 2019, entering a not-guilty plea in response to 16 new charges filed after an investigation by the WA Police's Child Abuse Squad. In January 2019, retired Perth priest Allan John Mithen received a 13-month suspended prison sentence after pleading guilty to two counts of sexually abusing an Aborigine girl at a mission in 1965. In March 2019, Joseph Tran, a well known and popular Perth priest, committed suicide after accusations surfaced that he had molested a girl for years. Diocese of Bunbury Adrian Richard Van Klooster pleaded guilty to four counts of indecently dealing with children under the age of 13 and was found with child pornography on his computer. =Archdiocese of Hobart=Marist Fathers of Tasmania Notable cases include: in 2007 Gregory Ferguson was sentenced to two years' jail (eligible for parole after 12 months) for offences in 1971 against two boys aged 13 at Marist College, Burnie, Tasmania. On 13 December 2007 he was sentenced to an additional three years' jail for offences against a third boy; in 2008 a jury found former priest Roger Michael Bellemore guilty on three counts of maintaining a sexual relationship with a young person under the age of 17 years in the 1960s and 1970s while he was at the same college. By December 2018, six former priests who taught at the College had been convicted of committing acts of sexual abuse. =Archdiocese of Canberra and Goulburn= In February 2008, a teacher at Marist College Canberra, Brother John William Chute (also known as Brother Kostka) pleaded guilty in the ACT Magistrates Court to 11 charges of indecently assaulting students of the college during the 1980s. Damages for sexual abuse have also been sought by former students at Marist College Canberra. A teacher at Daramalan College in Canberra was also charged with numerous sexual assaults in 2000; however, he committed suicide shortly after he was charged. Seven further charges against Chute relating to alleged offences committed before 1985 were dropped, due to a legal limitation that charges relating to sexual indecency had to be made within a year. In June 2008, Chute was sentenced in the ACT Supreme Court to six years in jail, serving two years in prison, one year in weekend detention, and three years suspended. =Transfer of accused clergy to Fiji= On July 13, 2020, New Zealand's 1News revealed that of some of at least 1,300 clergy who were accused of committing sexually abusing children in the nation of Fiji were originally from Australia before they were transferred. One example was Australian priest Julian Fox, was later convicted and jailed in 2015 for child sex crimes. Fox was transferred to Fiji in 1999 after Australian police started an investigation against him. The Catholic Church in Fiji also had knowledge of sex abuse allegations against Fox nine years before he was charged. Pope Benedict's statement On 19 July 2008, before a congregation of 3,400 assembled in Sydney's St Mary's Cathedral, Pope Benedict XVI lamented that child sex abuse had taken place and the pain it caused. He also condemned those responsible for it and demanded punishment for them. However, he did not state or imply that the institutional church, or any of its leaders, accepted any responsibility for what had taken place. His statement reads: > \\"Here I would like to pause to acknowledge the shame which we have all felt > as a result of the sexual abuse of minors by some clergy and religious in > this country. I am deeply sorry for the pain and suffering the victims have > endured and I assure them that, as their pastor, I too share in their > suffering. ... Victims should receive compassion and care, and those > responsible for these evils must be brought to justice. These misdeeds, > which constitute so grave a betrayal of trust, deserve unequivocal > condemnation. I ask all of you to support and assist your bishops, and to > work together with them in combating this evil. It is an urgent priority to > promote a safer and more wholesome environment, especially for young > people.\\" On 21 July 2008, before flying out of Australia, Pope Benedict met at St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney, with two male and two female victims of sex abuse by priests. He listened to their stories and celebrated Mass with them. The Premier of New South Wales, Morris Iemma, said that \\"Hopefully it will be a sign of righting the wrongs of the past and of a better future and better treatment by the church of the victims and their families.\\" Mark Fabbro, a victim of abuse and member of the Catholic Abuse Survivors Collective, said that while he was \\"happy to receive the apology, we still consider it indirect and insufficient\\". Chris MacIsaac of the victims' rights advocacy group Broken Rites said the Pope had taken his apology further than his previous comments on the issue as he has \\"never put it quite so strongly before\\", but expressed disappointment that the Pope had not made his apology directly to sexual abuse victims. One Australian victim of sexual abuse by a Catholic priest has stated in the media: \\"Dealing with the church itself was a hell of a lot more traumatic than dealing with the abuse.\\" See also ; Sexual abuse cases in catholic church * Catholic Church sex abuse cases * Catholic Church sex abuse cases by country * Catholic Church sex abuse cases in Belgium * Catholic Church sexual abuse cases in Canada * Catholic Church sexual abuse cases in Dublin * Catholic Church sex abuse cases in English Benedictine Congregation * Catholic Church sexual abuse cases in Ireland * Catholic sexual abuse cases in New Zealand * Catholic Church sex abuse cases in the United States * William Kamm, leader of schismatic catholic group convicted for sexual abuse ; Critique & consequences related topics * Criticism of Pope John Paul II * Debate on the causes of clerical child abuse * Ecclesiastical response to Catholic sex abuse cases * Instruction Concerning the Criteria for the Discernment of Vocations with Regard to Persons with Homosexual Tendencies in View of Their Admission to the Seminary and to Holy Orders * Media coverage of Catholic sex abuse cases * Settlements and bankruptcies in Catholic sex abuse cases * Sex Crimes and the Vatican, BBC documentary * Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, NGO for victims in USA ; Investigation, prevention and victim support related topics * Broken Rites Australia, support and advocacy group in Australia * National Review Board, USA * National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, UK * Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors * Sexual Addiction & Compulsivity, peer-reviewed journal on prevention & treatment * Virtus (program), church initiative in USA * Vos estis lux mundi, church procedure for abuse vases ; Other related topics * Child sexual abuse in Australia * Clerical celibacy * Homosexual clergy in the Catholic Church * Paraphilia * Pontifical secret * Spiritual abuse * Roman Catholicism in Australia References Child abuse in Australia Rape in Australia Incidents of violence against boys violence against children Violence against men Violence against women in Australia 21st-century scandals Sexual abuse cover-ups External links * Australian Catholic Historical Society: The Sexual Abuse Crisis ","title":"Catholic Church sexual abuse cases in Australia"},{"id":"23750801","text":"Arthur William Devenish Meares, also known as Arthur William Devenish-Meares or \\"Newry\\" Meares (1874‚Äì1935)Newry Meares player profile Scrum.com was an Irish rugby union player who won four caps for Ireland and two for the British Isles.

The tradition related to poor people being able to ask the more wealthy for food and drink at the celebrations of winter. Customarily a troupe of traveling male singers went from door to door to entertain and ring in the new year. Hosts were expected to give them food and drink. Other sources say the young men were seeking donations for Twelfth Night.Ekberg, Carl J., Colonial Ste. Genevieve: An Adventure on the Mississippi Frontier, Tucson, AZ: Patrice Press, 1996, , pp.320-321 Begun as a way for the poor to be given gratuities by the rich, it also became a community social event for young men to visit with the families of young women. Over time, the practice became an occasion for visiting with relatives and friends and was more or less a traveling feast. At first it was carried on only by young men, often in costume; women joined the party in the 20th century. In many years, the people appeared in disguise, as part of the celebration was a kind of overturning of the common order. This tradition has been practiced annually since 1722 in Prairie du Rocher, Illinois. It has been revived in Ste. Genevieve, Missouri. Both were former French colonial villages settled by French Canadians in the eighteenth century. In the latter town, current celebrations feature singers and musicians, attired in colonial dress, who begin their night's journey at the local American Legion Hall.

Its role was to ensure adequate supplies of uranium for the respective countries weapons development programs. The agency initiated a range of incentives to several countries to encourage exploration and a fast buildup of mineral reserves. The main countries targeted for the programs were the US, Canada, South Africa, and to a limited extent Australia. The countries tried to monopolize on the resources of the territories they owned or that had hardly any claim. The Belgian Congo was an example of the third world place that was used for its resources. In Australia, uranium ore from a number of mines was processed at the purpose built Port Pirie Uranium Treatment Complex which operated under contract to the CDA by the Government of South Australia between 1955 and 1962.  History  General Leslie Groves was a United States General that was put in charge of assembling and maintaining the Manhattan Project. He was a major campaigner for the creation of the CDT because he saw the importance of not only obtaining an adequate amount of uranium to complete the needs of the Manhattan Project, but also to attempt to obtain the uranium so that the Soviet Union would have less access. The entire world's stockpile of uranium was unknown, but a joint effort was a good start to securing access to the most uranium possible. He first created a program, Murray Hill Area Project, that‚Äôs main goal was to seek locations of uranium ore and thorium ore based on reports from mostly foreign documents. He found that protecting the thorium could prove just as important because it could be converted into uranium. This meant that finding the locations was only half the battle and funneled money into the purchase of the varies mineral rights.

Its traders and shops are involved in both wholesale and retain commerce. The main commodities and goods traded are clothes, Chikan embroidery work, spices, dry snacks, hosieries and wedding decorations. In fact, Aminabad is a combination of various markets, cluster of houses, offices and is often compared to the bustling Chandani Chowk of Delhi. History The year the market place came into being is not clear. But by all accounts it was during the rule of the Nawabs that the place got its present basic form and name. According to the most credible version of the history the land on which Aminabad stands belonged to Rani Jai Kunwar Pandey. The Rani, besides being a vassal of the Mughals, was also a very good friend of Khadija Khanam, the Begum (wife) of the first Nawab of Oudh, Saadat Khan Burhan-ul-Mulk, who was also the Grand-Wazir of the Mughal Empire. The Rani constructed a Mosque on this land and gifted it to her good friend, the wife of the Nawab. This 18th century Mosque, known as Padain Ki Masjid (The Brahmin Woman's Mosque), still stands in Aminabad. The maqbara of Begum Khadija Khanam was also constructed in front of the masjid, but it has been lost to the vagaries of time, though the grave is still to be seen. By the time the Nawabs moved their court from Faizabad to Lucknow, the site had become a center of activity and irregular commerce like weekly market etc.. It was a part of the city known as Masarratganj. The actual land on which Aminabad later was built had passed under the possession of Sikandar Shikoh, a son of the Mughal emperor Shah Alam II. After the death of Sikandar Shikoh his wife became custodian of the property in Masarratganj and she sold it for Rs.2800/- to Nawab Imdad Husain Khan Aminuddaulah, who was the Prime Minister of Nawab Amjad Ali Shah, the fourth Nawab of Lucknow. This was around 1840s. Aminuddaulah was a visionary and he took upon the task of metamorphosing this area into a developed zone. Over the following years concrete houses, shops and parks replaced the thatched huts and ramshackle shelters in the open fields. Traders, craftsmen and entertainers were encouraged to set up their establishments. Four gates had been erected on all the four sides and each gate had an adjoining mosque. The biggest gate known as Kalaan Phatak was at the main crossing and the mosque near it was also called Kalaan Phatak Masjid. Towards the west was the smaller Khurd Gate near Mehra Cinema on Gwynne Road. The gates no longer exist but the mosques are still there and are known by their original names. Aminuddaulah also initiated the construction of a big park in the open space within the rows of the newly opened shops during this time. After the revolt of 1857 the rule of the Nawabs came to an end and the Aminabad came under British rule. After the mutiny of 1857, the entire area came under the rule of the British. Later in 1905 Lt. Governor Sir J.D. Latouche, visited Aminabad and ordered its renovation. It was then that Loutouche Road leading to this market came into existence and till date is called so. The renovated Aminabad was inaugurated by Sir Loutouche himself in 1911. Meanwhile, Babu Ganga Prasad Varma came to live in Aminabad in 1910 and designed the market with big corridors so that roads could be used for walking Ganga Prasad memorial hall was built by him for public functions. He was the one who came up with Goonge Nawab Park. In 1912 the British government made a master plan for this area and, as per the plan, roads on all the four side of this park were laid out and the park came to be known as Aminuddaulah Park. In the following years the importance and stature of Chowk and Nakhas bazaar started receding and Aminabad gained ascendancy, and Aminuddaulah Park became not only the talk of the town but the nation itself. In 1928 it was at this park where during the struggle for independence the freedom fighters first hoisted the tri-colour. That eventful day was followed by the address to the nation by Mahatma Gandhi for the civil disobedience movement. Many more leaders including Jawahar Lal Nehru, Atal Bihari Bajpayee and Subhash Chandra Bose gave fiery speeches for independence at this platform. The huge congregation that had gathered at Aminuddaulah Park to listen to Jawahar Lal Nehru was brutally lathi-charged by the British force and several people, including Nehru, got hurt. Gulab Singh Lodhi had climbed up a tree in the park and hoisted the tri-colour flag. The British police shot him down and later on his statue was installed in the centre of the park and still stands there. The park by now had acquired the name of Jhandewala Park because flags of various Indian political parties fluttered here. Prior to independence the literati of the city had made Aminabad their place of dwelling and they eagerly awaited the leading Indian newspapers like Humdum, Haqeeqat and Pioneer each morning. Newspaper vendors would come to the main crossing early morning and their wares were sold till late evening. The writers, poets and educationists even then frequented Danish Mahal in the ground floor of Central Hotel, and the nearby Siddiq Book Depot and Anwar Book Depot. There was a time when at these erudite centres one could have come across the likes of Syed Masood Hasan Rizvi, Dr. Shujaat Ali Sandilavi, Josh Malihabadi, Prof. Ehtesham Husain, Nawab Mir Jafar Ali Khan ‚ÄòAsar‚Äô, Majaz and many more. The owner of Danish Mahal, Nasim Ahmad, who passed away recently, was not only well-conversant with all kinds of books, but was also familiar with the persona and wherewithal of the stalwarts of the town. Since the time of Nawabs, the market boasts of its unmatched fashion, and being one of the oldest markets, it is still surrounded by buildings and architectures of nawabi era. Shops Shops sell fashion products, interior decoration, bed sheets bed Covers, carpets, ornaments, jewelry, fashion garments, fancy dresses, chikan kurta, chikan sarees and other women's wear, chikan menswear, footwear and other such apparel. Most products are locally produced. A special attraction is Thursday's footpath market. Among the less wide streets of the nawabi times, the market shows off a wide variety of products on sale. In spite of being congested at times, Aminabad is a colorful, vibrant and a lively market to shop, and with products ranging from gold and silver to jewelry and ornaments, chikan kurtas to fancy sarees loaded with embroidery, from Lucknawi paan (betel leaves) to bakeries. Eateries include non-vegetarian restaurants, sweet shops, bakeries and paan shops, including Tunday Kababi, Wahid Biryani and Alamgir, Kalika Chat House Some of the oldest shops are Om Prakash Seth, Madan Sarees, Dupatta Mahal, Sargodha Cloth House, Sri Keshav Handloom, Keshav Decor.

In the most recent census (2001) Hollington had a population of 212. There are only a few buildings in Hollington of note such as the Red Lion pub to serve the small population. Hollington does have a building of historical importance, a 500-year-old wooden framed house named Lodge Farm; this building currently is a grade II listed building.  Location and land use  At last count the village had 84 households with the average house containing over 7 rooms in total. The vast majority of the houses are either detached or bungalows, which is to be expected of a country parish of this size. The other land uses involve mostly agricultural land, though there used to be a Church of England school and a church in the parish. These have both been closed and the church converted into a house and sold privately.  Population  The population in Hollington is currently recorded in the census along with other nearby settlements; as a result it is hard to determine the current total population. During the last census that Hollington was individually analysed in 1961 it was at 164 people; much lower than roughly 90 years before, when it was at 261. Of the 212 people currently living in Hollington 149 are between 16 and 74 and of those people 95 people are economically active 28 are in the manufacturing industry and 72 are in the service industry, likely working in the nearby towns and cities. File:Hollington population chart.png  Farming  Hollington was recorded in the Domesday Book in 1086 as Holintune, meaning in old English, the farmstead where holly grows. This along with other historical references has shown that the parish has mostly always been an agricultural village. The area is known for having high quality soil known as keuper marl, which is considered effective for farming and milk production. Modern farming in the area has changed considerably in recent years compared to the past, for example half way through the 20th century there were as many as 18 farms in Hollington all working on a small scale with only a few animals, but now there are very few farms, much larger in size. This is because as the old farmers retired, their farmland was purchased by larger companies and combined with their own land to create even larger farms. Also a major handicap on large scale farming was removed in the 1950s when piped water was made available where as before the only water supply was pumped up by hand. This made it easier to water large scale farms and to take care of more animals than was possible before.  Hollington Chapel  In the past there was very little available to the people in terms of services; one of the main buildings most parishes would have wanted in the past would have been a church, but the chapel in Hollington was not built until 1847. Records show that the church in the nearby village of Longford was used by people in Hollington. Records show that the chapel in Hollington was very well attended for many years and the location of many of the parishes‚Äô events such as a harvest festival; it was then closed in 1992 and sold and converted into a home in 1995.  Hollington millennium committee  The Hollington millennium committee was formed in 1999 in order to organise the millennium celebration, but after the success of the celebration the committee continued to operate, setting up many more events, including fundraisers for the queen‚Äôs golden Jubilee party in 2002. The fundraisers have also been used in order to restore the village greens, plant trees and more. Though in current years lack of support from the locals has made it so the committee has had to struggle with poor turnouts.

As the case begins to center on dyslexia, Will waits nervously to see if anyone will notice his own, and he and Faith race frantically from the dormitories of Georgia Tech to the halls of one of Atlanta's exclusive private academies to keep another corpse from surfacing.

The old cathedral of Dromore, which had been taken by the Protestants, was burnt down by the Irish insurgents in 1641, and rebuilt by Bishop Taylor twenty years later; the Catholic Church was erected later. In 1750 the seat of the cathedral was transferred to Newry the largest town of County Down situated at the head of Carlingford Lough. Newry Cathedral, dedicated under the joint patronage of St Patrick & St Colman, was designed by the city's greatest native architect Thomas Duff and work began in 1825 with the basic building completed in 1829.https://discovernorthernireland.com/Newry-Cathedral-of-St- Patrick-and-St-Colman-Newry-P3091/ Built of local granite, it was the first Catholic Cathedral in Ireland opened after Catholic Emancipation.

The aquarium's exhibition focuses on the Black Sea's flora and fauna which includes over 140 fish species, but also features freshwater fish, Mediterranean fish, exotic species from faraway areas of the World Ocean, mussels and algae. The foundation of the aquarium was initiated by Prince Ferdinand I on 6 January 1906 in the Euxinograd palace. Ferdinand entrusted Doctor Parashkev Stoyanov with the establishment of a maritime biological station. The monarch also requested assistance from the prominent German biologist Anton Dohrn, founder of the Stazione Zoologica in Naples, who provided Ferdinand with blueprints and photographs of the Naples station. On 25 January 1906, the Varna Municipal Council allotted money for the aquarium's construction and appointed a commission in order to select a suitable location for the building. The foundation stone was laid on 22 October the same year in Varna's Sea Garden in the presence of Prince Ferdinand and the Bulgarian Royal Family, as well as many important statesmen and intellectuals. The aquarium's edifice was constructed to the design of Munich-educated Varna architect Dabko Dabkov. The building's facade is decorated with a sizable bas-relief of a clam and smaller reliefs of popular Black Sea species. The edifice was completed by 1911. However, the outbreak of the Balkan Wars in 1912 delayed the opening of the aquarium. In 1913, Ferdinand made the building property of Sofia University. World War I and the severe sanctions imposed on Bulgaria with the Treaty of Neuilly did not permit the unveiling of the aquarium until 1932, when the maritime biological station was inaugurated by Tsar Boris III. Until 1932, the building had accommodated army units, Bulgarian refugees from Thrace, the School of Mechanics and the School of Fishing. Today, the aquarium's research unit, the adjoined Institute for Fish Resources, includes 12 scientists who conduct research related to hydrobiology, hydrochemistry, marine microbiology, ichthyology, plankton and benthos.

A French frigate force that had been raiding British commerce off West Africa approached and attempted to attack a convoy of valuable East Indiamen, large and heavily armed merchant vessels sailing from Britain to British India and China, two ships sailing for Botany Bay, and a whaler sailing for the South Seas' whale fishery. The small British ship of the line escorted the convoy, which otherwise had to rely on the ships' individual armament to protect them from attack. Due to their large size, the East Indiamen could be mistaken for ships of the line at a distance, and the French commander Commodore Jean- Fran√ßois Landolphe was un-nerved when the convoy formed a line of battle. Supposing his target to be a fleet of powerful warships he turned to escape and the British commander, Captain Rowley Bulteel, immediately ordered a pursuit. To preserve the impression of warships he also ordered four of his most powerful East Indiamen to join the chase. Belliqueux rapidly out ran Landolphe's flagship Concorde, leaving Landolphe with no option but to surrender without any serious resistance. The rest of the French squadron continued to flee separately during the night, each pursued by two East Indiamen. After an hour and a half in pursuit, with darkness falling, the East Indiaman came alongside the French M√©d√©e, giving the impression by use of lights that she was a large ship of the line. Believing himself outgunned, Captain Jean-Daniel Coudin surrendered, only discovering his assailant's true identity when he came aboard. The action is the only occasion during the war in which a British merchant vessel captured a large French warship. Background By 1800, the British and French had been at war for seven years and the British dominated the sea, following a number of significant victories over the French, Dutch and Spanish fleets.Nelson Against Napoleon, Gardiner, p.11. Off every French port, large squadrons of British ships of the line and frigates awaited French movements and whenever possible intercepted and destroyed French merchant vessels and warships. While British trading ships travelled in large, well-armed convoys, French ships were forced to slip between harbours to avoid the British blockade. To counter British control of the seas, the French periodically despatched squadrons of ships to raid British trade lanes, particularly off West Africa and in the South Atlantic, where the stretched Royal Navy maintained only minimal forces.Nelson Against Napoleon, Gardiner, p. 12 The large convoys of East Indiamen were among the principal targets for any French raider. These huge ships sailed from Britain with general cargo, or often military stores and troops, to India or other ports in the Indian Ocean, South East Asia, or China. There they would sell their cargoes and take on spices, tea, silk and other luxury goods before making the return journey to Britain. A round trip took over a year and an East Indiaman sailing to Britain would routinely carry hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of trade goods; one large convoy that sailed from Canton in January 1804 was worth over ¬£8 million.The Victory of Seapower, Gardiner, p. 88. East Indiamen were well-protected, armed with up to 30 guns, and generally travelled in large convoys in which the ships could provide one another with mutual protection. Such convoys often had a Royal Navy escort, usually including a ship of the line.The Victory of Seapower, Gardiner, p. 101 On 6 March 1799, a French squadron had sailed from Rochefort. Consisting of the frigates Concorde, under Commodore Jean-Fran√ßois Landolphe, M√©d√©e, under Captain Jean-Daniel Coudin, and Franchise, under Captain Pierre Jurien, it was a powerful force, capable of inflicting significant damage on lightly defended merchant shipping. Eluding the blockade force off Rochefort, the squadron sailed southwards until it reached the coast of West Africa. There Landolphe's ships began an extended commerce raiding operation, inflicting severe damage on the West African trade during the rest of the year. Eventually the strain of serving in tropical waters told on the ships and all three were forced to undergo an extensive refit in the nearest available allied shipyards, which were located in the Spanish-held River Plate in South America.James, Vol. 3, p. 45 Repairs continued for six months, until Landolphe considered the squadron once again ready to sail in the early summer of 1800. The squadron almost immediately captured an American schooner, which it fitted out as a tender.Nelson Against Napoleon, Gardiner, p. 148. At the time, France and the United States had been engaged for two years in the Quasi War. Battle The British convoy consisted of the East Indiamen , , , , and , the Botany Bay ships and , and the whaler .Lloyd's List, ‚Äì accessed 11 November 2013. The sole British warship was Belliqueux.Woodman, p. 148. On 4 August they were near the island of Trinidade off the Brazilian coast. From there the East Indiamen would catch the westerly trade winds that would carry them to Saint Helena, the Cape of Good Hope, and their destinations. At 07:00 on 4 August, while the French squadron was cruising off the Brazilian coast, lookouts sighted sails on the horizon. Uncertain of the identity of the strange ships, the French gradually closed the distance during the morning. Landolphe could see that there were seven large vessels and three smaller ships, all unmistakably British. He was unable however to tell whether they were naval ships of the line or East Indiamen. Initially he thought they might be merchant ships, but at noon he sighted double rows of gunports along the side of each ship and called off the attack, turning away and signalling for his squadron to split up, believing the enemy to be large warships easily capable of destroying his small force. Captain Jurien protested Landolphe's order, insisting that the convoy was composed of merchant ships and not warships, but Landolphe over-ruled Jurien's protests.Clowes, p. 532 In fact, Jurien was correct. With the French in full flight, Bulteel determined to continue the ruse that his convoy consisted of warships. While he and Belliqueux pursued Concorde, he signalled for his largest East Indiamen to follow the other French ships to ensure that they did not return and counterattack the convoy while Belliqueux was engaged. Exeter, under Captain Henry Meriton, and Bombay Castle, under Captain John Hamilton, were to follow M√©d√©e while Coutts, under Captain Robert Torin, and Neptune, under Captain Nathaniel Spens, were to follow Franchise. All four vessels were over 1200 tons (bm) and carried 30 cannon each, but none had more than 130 crew aboard and could not compete in accuracy or rate of fire with the 315 men aboard each of the French ships. Throughout the afternoon the chase continued, with Belliqueux steadily gaining on the French flagship while Franchise, accompanied by the American schooner, gained on her pursuers. At 17:20, Bulteel was within long range of Landolphe's ship, which returned fire when possible. During the exchange of gunfire neither side suffered damage or casualties, but the ship of the line was clearly gaining on the frigate and within ten minutes Landolphe surrendered rather than see his ship destroyed and his men killed in an unequal combat.Woodman, p. 149 By 19:00, Franchise had dumped her lifeboats and a large quantity of guns and supplies overboard, lightening the ship enough for her to far outstrip the pursuit. As night fell the French frigate made a full escape from the British force. M√©d√©e however had not escaped. Although Bombay Castle was many miles behind, only distantly visible on the horizon, Exeter had been able to follow the frigate closely. Meriton was aware that the French warship was much stronger than his own merchant vessel, but realized that as the frigate had made no effort to fight, her commander must believe Exeter to be a ship of the line. To reinforce this image in the rapidly approaching darkness, Meriton arranged lights behind every gunport, whether or not it contained a cannon, creating an effect described as \\"a fearsome, leering jack-o'-lantern\\".Miller, p. 155 As his ship drew level with the French frigate, Meriton hailed the enemy's deck, calling on them to surrender. Intimidated by this large and seemingly powerful enemy, Coudin decided that his only option was to strike his flag and come aboard the British ship to surrender formally.James, Vol. 3, p. 46 Arriving on board, he was astonished to see far fewer and smaller guns than a warship normally carried. When Coudin asked to whom he had surrendered, Meriton is said to have replied \\"To a merchantman\\". Appalled, Coudin demanded to be allowed to return to his ship and conduct a formal naval battle, but Meriton refused. Aftermath In the engagement on 4 August 1800 neither side had a single man killed or wounded; the action still inflicted a severe naval defeat on a powerful French frigate force, ending its successful raiding career. Although Captain Jurien in Franchise spent another three weeks off the Brazilian coast before returning to France. On 9 August he encountered the merchantman Wellesley, which was on her way to the Cape, but after an engagement of about an hour, the British ship succeeded in driving off her attacker.Grant (1803), p. 52. Jurien followed Wellesley for two days but then gave up the chase;Grant (1803), p. 52. he then did not see another sail until he left the area. Bulteel's convoy continued on, pausing at Rio de Janeiro on 12 August to resupply. The East Indiamen then went on to Saint Helena on their way to Asia. The two Botany Bay ships sailed on to Australia and the whaler Seringapatam sailed for the South Seas. The captured frigates were valuable prizes but the Royal Navy only acquired Med√©e, which it took into service as HMS Medee, which it never commissioned but instead used as a prison ship for a few years before selling her in 1805. The frigates had come into port shortly before the Peace of Amiens and thus were deemed surplus to Navy requirements. The ships and their stores and equipment were sold privately; the proceeds from the sale were paid as prize money in February 1803. The British crews also benefited from head- money, a financial award for each French sailor captured during the engagement. Bulteel and Meriton were commended. Meriton was to fight two more naval battles against the French, serving at the successful defence of the China Fleet at the Battle of Pulo Aura in February 1804. He was badly wounded and captured by a French frigate squadron after a fierce defence at the Action of 3 July 1810.James, Vol. 5, p. 264.

Alexander successfully pacified each in turn, leaving him free to begin the long planned invasion of Persia. In 336 BC, while attending the wedding of his daughter by Olympias, Cleopatra and Olympias' brother, Alexander I of Epirus at Aegae, Philip II was assassinated by the captain of his bodyguard, Pausanias. Philip's son, and previously designated heir, Alexander was proclaimed king by the Macedonian noblemen and army.McCarty, Alexander the Great, p. 30-31. * Plutarch, The Age of Alexander, p. 262-263 * Renault, The Nature of Alexander the Great, p. 61-62 * Fox, The Search For Alexander, p. 72 News of Philip's death roused many states into revolt including Thebes, Athens, Thessaly and the Thracian tribes to the north of Macedon. When news of the revolt reached Alexander he responded quickly. Though his advisors advised him to use diplomacy, Alexander mustered the Macedonian cavalry of 3,000 men and rode south towards Thessaly, Macedon's immediate neighbor to the south. When he found the Thessalian army occupying the pass between Mount Olympus and Mount Ossa, he had the men ride through Mount Ossa and, when the Thessalians awoke, they found Alexander at their rear. The Thessalians surrendered and added their cavalry to Alexander's force as he rode down towards the Peloponnese.McCarty, Alexander the Great, p. 31. * Plutarch, The Age of Alexander, p. 263 * Renault, The Nature of Alexander the Great, p. 72 * Fox, The Search For Alexander, p. 104 * Bose, Alexander the Great's Art of Strategy, p. 95 Alexander stopped at Thermopylae, where he was recognised as the leader of the Sacred League before heading south to Corinth. Athens sued for peace and Alexander received the envoy and pardoned anyone involved with the uprising. At Corinth, he was given the title 'Hegemon' of the Greek forces against the Persians. While at Corinth, he heard the news of the Thracian rising to the north.Bose, Alexander the Great's Art of Strategy, p. 96. * Renault, The Nature of Alexander the Great, p. 72 Thrace Thracian tribes Before crossing to Asia, Alexander wanted to safeguard his northern borders and, in the spring of 335 BC, he advanced into Thrace to deal with the revolt, which was led by the Illyrians and Triballi. He was reinforced along the way by the Agriani, a Thracian tribe under the command of Alexander's friend, Langarus. The Macedonian army marched up to Mount Haemus, where they met a Thracian garrison manning the heights. The Thracians had constructed a palisade of carts, which they intended to throw upon the approaching Macedonians. Alexander ordered his heavy infantry to march in loose formation and, when the carts were thrown, either to open the ranks or lie flat on the ground with their shields over them. The Macedonian archers shot and when the Macedonian heavy infantry reached the top of the mountain they routed the Thracians.Arrian, The Campaigns of Alexander, p. 44. * Renault, The Nature of Alexander the Great, p. 73 The Macedonian phalanx at the \\"Battle of the Carts\\" against the Thracians in 335 BC Meanwhile, a large Triballian army led by their king, Syrmus, advanced upon the Macedonian rear. The Triballians retreated to a gorge, where they were drawn out by Alexander's light infantry. On the open ground, they were crushed by Alexander's infantry and cavalry, leaving behind 3,000 dead. The West Thracian Triballian king Syrmus took refuge on Peuce Island in the Danube Delta when pursued by Alexander the Great. Alexander brought ships up the Danube to use in an assault on the island. The attempts failed due to the swift current of the river, steep banks, and fierce defense. Eventually the Macedonians abandoned their attacks on Peuce and instead crossed into the territory of the Getae.Arrian 1.3 The Macedonians marched to the Danube River where they encountered the Getae tribe on the opposite shore. As Alexander's ships failed to enter the river, Alexander's army made rafts out of their leather tents. A force of 4,000 infantry and 1,500 cavalry crossed the river, to the amazement of the Getae army of 14,000 men. The Getae army retreated after the first cavalry skirmish, leaving their town to the Macedonian army.Arrian, The Campaigns of Alexander, p. 45-48. * Renault, The Nature of Alexander the Great, p. 73-74 Illyria The Siege of Pelium was undertaken by Alexander the Great against the Illyrian tribes of what is modern day Albania.Hammond-Walbank, A History of Macedonia, pp. 39-48Ashley, The Macedonian Empire, pp. 171-175 It was critical for Alexander to take this pass as it provided easy access to Illyria and Macedonia, which was urgently needed in order to quell the unrest in Greece at this time in Athens and Thebes. This was an important point of demarcation in Alexander's early reign, as it established him among the Danubian tribes to the north as a serious monarch to be reckoned with, just as he would later establish this precedent for the Greek city states under his hegemony. Taking this place allowed Alexander to march his army to southern Greece quickly, which would eventually result in the total destruction of Thebes. Thebes The Battle of Thebes was a battle that took place between Alexander III of Macedon and the Greek city state of Thebes in 335 BC immediately outside of and in the city proper. After having been made Hegemon of the League of Corinth, Alexander had marched to the north to deal with revolts in Illyria and Thrace. The garrison in Macedonia was weakened and Thebes declared its independence. The Thebans refused to submit on merciful terms, and he assaulted the city, razed it to the ground, and sold all the survivors into slavery. With the destruction of Thebes, mainland Greece again acquiesced in Alexander's rule. Alexander was now finally free to undertake the Persian campaign which had been planned for so long by his father. See also *Ancient Macedonian army ReferencesBibliography * Renault, Mary, (2001).

Undertaken by the Allies in 1942, it was the first attempt at deception by the London Controlling Section (LCS) and was designed to convince the Axis powers that the Allies would soon invade German-occupied Norway. The LCS had recently been established to plan deception across all theatres, but had struggled for support from the unenthusiastic military establishment. The LCS had little guidance in strategic deception, an activity pioneered by Dudley Clarke the previous year, and was unaware of the extensive double agent system controlled by MI5. As a result, Hardboiled was planned as a real operation rather than a fictional one. Clarke had already found this approach to be wasteful in time and resources, preferring to present a \\"story\\" using agents and wireless traffic. Resistance to the operation by the chosen units meant that much of the preparation was not completed. Adolf Hitler ordered the reinforcement of Scandinavia in March and April 1942, before Hardboiled was shelved in May. It is unclear to what extent the operation contributed to his decision. Despite its limited impact, the operation gave the LCS experience in planning deceptions, and laid the groundwork for future exploitation of Hitler's belief that Northern Europe was strategically important. Background Strategic deception was a new topic for the Allies, having been pioneered in 1941 in Cairo by Dudley Clarke and his Advanced Headquarters 'A' Force. Following a presentation in September by Clarke, the Joint Planning Staff of the British War Ministry decided that a special organisation should be set up to plan and execute deception operations. They recommended that a \\"controlling section\\" be set up to oversee strategic deception planning, which would then be put into practice at the operational level by the armed services. The idea was approved and Clarke was offered the role. After he declined, the Chiefs of Staff chose Colonel Oliver Stanley, the former Secretary of State for War, as the new Controlling Officer. Stanley had great difficulty in convincing the Allied military establishment, which was sceptical of strategic deception and resistant to the idea of a central planning authority, to take part in an operation. Despite obtaining a few staff officers, the London Controlling Section (LCS) was, in the words of one member, in a state of \\"near impotence\\". In December 1941 Stanley received permission to plan the LCS's first operation, following several months of pressure on the Allied command. Planning Royal Marines, the unit chosen for Hardboiled, training in deep snow during March 1942 Hardboiled had no specific goal for the Allies, other than to convince the Germans of an imminent invasion threat against Norway. Clarke had already established that deception operations should have a clear idea of what the enemy was supposed to do (rather than what they were expected to think). Stanley was unaware of this, not being in communication with Clarke's department in Cairo. As a result, the objective for Hardboiled was chosen because the resources existed and it would not affect real future operations (planners had already rejected Norway as a viable target), rather than for any strategic advantage it brought the Allies. Stanley was also unaware of the extensive double agent network under the control of the Twenty Committee, having merely been told that MI5 had an avenue through which to pass information to the enemy. Stanley at first proposed that the notional target should be Narvik or Trondheim. Allied commanders decided these were implausible targets because of their northern location and an amphibious landing at Stavanger was chosen, based on planning for Operation Dynamite (a previously considered, and rejected, invasion of the country). The date of the fictional invasion was set for 1 May 1942. Hardboiled was planned as a real operation, involving actual training and troop movements, culminating in the embarkation of a fake invasion. The plan relied on German intelligence, rumour and leaks to convey the deception to the enemy. Clarke and 'A' Force had already discovered in previous operations that realistic training was wasteful, having found that much of the effort could be falsified using agents and wireless traffic. The LCS lacked guidance from Cairo and so made many of the same mistakes. The LCS also lacked knowledge of MI5's Double-Cross System and its double agents. The department were unaware that no uncontrolled German operatives were active in the UK, and so incorrectly believed any deception would have to be highly realistic to appear genuine. Before the operation could go into action, Stanley had one final objection; he found the codename Hardboiled \\"silly\\". LCS member Dennis Wheatley had picked it from a book of codewords, and explained to Stanley (who was unaware) that the name had been randomly selected so as to bear no relation to the operation's aims. Operation The Royal Marines Division were earmarked for Hardboiled, trained in mountain warfare, and given cold weather equipment. Realistic invasion plans were drawn up and Norwegian currency was stockpiled. These preparations met with considerable resistance from the armed forces, who considered the operation to be a waste of effort. The need for soldiers in real operations and training meant that, in the end, a lot of the preparation never occurred. The LCS attempted passive deception as part of Hardboiled. Agents canvassed Norwegian refugees for information about Stavanger and for possible interpreters. The hope was that rumours would reach neutral countries and filter back to the German intelligence network. Some deception was also passed on via agents. Impact Hardboiled soon petered out as the Royal Marines were required for an amphibious operation in Madagascar in July 1942. It had appeared effective, as during April and May the Germans had reinforced the region. Historian Joshua Levine notes that Hitler had a \\"near-obsession with defence of Scandinavia\\" during this period and that it is unclear how much the operation had contributed to his strategy. Michael Howard, who wrote the official British history of strategic deception, attributes the lacklustre response to severe setbacks the Allies were then facing on every front, and writes that it is difficult to imagine the Germans believing that a major offensive operation was being planned. The operation did not give the Allies any tactical or strategic advantage; Howard notes that it provided experience for the planners in handling deception and for the Twenty Committee in proving the worth of double agents. Terry Crowdy, writing in 2008, argued that any experience that the LCS attained was limited by the lack of guidance from Cairo and knowledge of double agents. Dudley Clarke had already shown that the most effective method of deception involved the use of agents and faked wireless traffic, rather than major training and troop movements. Hardboiled was the first deception plan aimed at Norway. It led into several others, including Operation Tindall and Operation Solo, culminating in the 1944 Operation Fortitude North, one of the Allies' largest and most successful deceptions. In May 1942, John Bevan replaced Stanley as head of the LCS, after the latter had asked Winston Churchill for permission to re-enter politics. At the same time, the committee was given much broader powers. Hardboiled was sidelined by the new regime, and had been dropped entirely from the LCS programme by the end of May.

A sixth victim, who was pregnant at the time of the attack, survived, but her child was delivered stillborn. The crimes took place in 1978 and 1979, but Parker was not identified as the killer until 1996. Parker confessed to the murders, and was sentenced to death on January 21, 1999. Following his conviction, another man, Kevin Lee Green, who had been charged with one of the murders and had served 16 years in prison, was exonerated and released. Early life Parker was born in 1955, into a poor family with 11 brothers and sisters. In 1963, his mother passed away, and his grandmother had to take care of him. After the death of his mother, Parker and his family moved into segregated housing in Arizona. In the mid-1960s, Parker and his brothers moved to a neighborhood mainly populated by African-Americans with little to no education, and was a frequent target of bullies. Due to trouble at school, he began to huff household and industrial chemicals, eventually becoming addicted. In the late 1960s, Parker moved with his family to San Diego, California. In his teens, he began to use drugs such as mescaline and LSD, his school grades worsening as a result. In 1970, he stole several items from his school, but was captured and promptly expelled. Due to his age and the laws of the juvenile court, however, he wasn't charged with a crime. He was transferred under supervision of guardians to the Boys Republic, a private all-boys school for troubled adolescents, located in Chino. After spending several months at the school, Parker escaped and led a transient lifestyle for the next few years. In 1973, Parker enlisted in the United States Army and enrolled into the Marine Corps. Until 1974, he served at a military base in Adak, Alaska, after which he was transferred to Tustin, where he worked from 1974 to 1977. In 1978, he received the honorary title of staff sergeant. In 1978, he continued his service at the El Toro air station in Irvine, where he served until the beginning of 1980, when, due to problems with law enforcement, he was forced to resign. Crimes On February 15, 1980, Parker abducted and raped a 14-year-old girl in Tustin. He released her without causing her any further serious injuries. The victim contacted the police and described the car and appearance of her assailant, on the basis of which Parker was soon arrested. He confessed to the crime, and in exchange for a commutation of his sentence, he also admitted to a robbery committed 13 days earlier in Pasadena, while visiting his brother. Parker was found guilty of rape and received an eight-year sentence, which he served at the California Correctional Institution in Tehachapi. On February 13, 1984, while in custody, Parker attacked his cellmate David Feertadot with a blunt object, inflicting serious head injuries. The motive for the attack was never established, and in June 1984, Parker was given an additional sentence for causing grievous bodily harm. In November 1987, he was paroled and released. Over the next few years, he led a transient lifestyle, periodically working as a day laborer, but earning his income mainly through thefts. In July 1993, he was arrested for several thefts and robberies in Orange County, for which he was convicted and sentenced to four years imprisonment. However, in February 1995, he was paroled again. In January the following year, Parker was rearrested for violating the conditions of his parole and returned to prison to serve out his sentence. During this time, he was forced to give a blood sample. Exposure DNA profiling tests were conducted on the blood sample from Parker, which showed that his profile corresponded to that of an unidentified serial killer who left biological traces during six attacks on different women around Orange County between 1978 and 1979, using primarily a 2x4 piece of lumber, a hammer or mallet. For this reason, the killer was nicknamed \\"The Bedroom Basher\\". Based on this, on June 14, 1996, Gerald Parker was questioned for his involvement at his cell in the Avenal State Prison. He denied having to do anything with the killings and protested his innocence, but under pressure from mounting evidence, he confessed during another interrogation two days later. According to his testimony, on December 1, 1978, in Anaheim, Parker entered the apartment of 17-year-old Sandra Fry, whom he raped and beat severely, inflicting severe head injuries that later killed her. Parker‚Äôs next murder took place on March 31, 1979, in Costa Mesa. He entering the apartment of 21-year-old Kimberly Rawlins, whom he raped and then hit on the head with a blunt object. As with Fry, he left biological traces on Rawlins' body. On September 14, he entered the apartment of 31-year-old Marilyn Carleton, brutally beating her during an attempted rape, causing her severe head injuries, which she would die from the following day. This crime was witnessed by the victim's nine-year-old son, who subsequently described the attacker to police. On September 30, Parker attacked 20-year-old nurse Dianna Green, who was 9 months pregnant. He beat her with a piece of blackboard and subsequently raped her. Green survived, but her child was stillborn and she fell into a retrograde amnesia. The killer left the crime scene unnoticed and didn't leave any clues behind, as a result of which Kevin Green, the victim‚Äôs husband, was wrongfully charged, convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for the attack in 1980. On October 6, Parker entered the Tustin apartment of 24-year- old Deborah Kennedy. He attacked and severely beat her with a hammer, causing her severe head injuries and a brain hemorrhage; she later died of her injuries. In this instance, Parker managed to avoid leaving behind any incriminating evidence, aside from his semen traces on the victim's body. Fourteen days later, he committed another murder in Costa Mesa. He entered the apartment of 17-year-old Deborah Senior, raping and then beating her with a blunt object, inflicting severe head injuries that eventually killed her. This time, Parker left behind not only his biological traces, but a palm print of his left hand. During interrogations, Parker's testimony turned out to be consistent with the times and dates of the crimes, despite his claims that he had committed these acts while in an intoxicated state. Trial Gerald Parker's trial began in 1997. He did not dispute his guilt in the murders. The main evidence was based around the DNA tests and his own confession, because of which he was sentenced to death by lethal injection in 1999. The charges against Kevin Green, convicted of assaulting his wife and murdering their unborn daughter, were dropped, and he was released after spending 16 years behind bars. Aftermath Parker is currently incarcerated at San Quentin State Prison, awaiting execution. In 2017, his lawyers appealed for the nullification of his death sentence and for a new trial, arguing that Parker was mentally disturbed at the time of the murders, as a result of his being bullied as a child combined with abuse of drugs and alcohol. However, that appeal was rejected.

It was formed by the merger of several schools when the government began to abolish the tripartite system in the mid-1960s. Springwood has over 1700 pupils, including a Sixth Form with over 300 pupils and has been designated a Specialist Performing Arts College. Ofsted consistently rate the school as \\"Good\\", the most recent inspection having been in February 2017. History Springwood was formed in 1979 by the merger of the Alderman Catleugh Secondary School and the King's Lynn Girls High School. The name Springwood was chosen for the newly formed school due to the main site being adjacent to the Spring Wood. At the beginning of the 2010‚Äì11 academic year, Andrew Johnson took over as headteacher from Peter Hopkins, who had been part of the school since 1995. Springwood is part of the West Norfolk Academies Trust, a group of four secondary schools and seven primary schools. Site There were three sites for the school, the old Alderman Catleugh at the end of Queensway with its two wings and in excess of 20 mobile classrooms, the new block of the girls High School also on Queensway and a smaller original site of the girls High School located in King Street in the town centre. The two main sites were used for 11 - 16 schooling whilst the town centre site was used for the Sixth Form, the King Street site eventually being sold off for a housing complex and the main two sites being upgraded and extended. Curriculum The school runs a two-year Key Stage 3, leaving three years for students to prepare for GCSEs. Ofsted reported in 2017: > Pupils learn within a calm, orderly environment and enjoy positive > relationships with their teachers and with each other. They speak > articulately and with confidence, wear their uniform with pride, and treat > the school site with respect. Leaders and teachers emphasise the importance > of academic achievement; pupils respond to these high expectations by > working diligently ‚Äì often with evident enthusiasm. Activities Springwood offers the Duke of Edinburgh Award for motivated pupils. There are also various clubs and societies. =House System= Each student belongs to one of five houses, which are each named after a Norfolk country house. *Felbrigg *Blickling *Oxburgh *Holkham *Sandringham See also *King's Lynn Academy *King Edward VII Academy *St Clement's High School ReferencesExternal links *School Website *Government Schools Information *2011 Ofsted Inspection Report 1979 establishments in England King's Lynn Academies in Norfolk Secondary schools in Norfolk Educational institutions established in 1979 ","title":"Springwood High School, King's Lynn"},{"id":"23751686","text":"Pink Ludoos () is a 2004 film directed by Gaurav Seth, about a Sikh family in Canada.

He was one of the first professors of Greek descent to teach Greek in Padua. Biography Thomaeus was born in Venice, Italy on February 1, 1456 to a Greek family from Epirus. While in Florence, he studied Greek philosophy and literature under the tutelage of Demetrios Chalcondyles. In 1497, the University of Padua appointed Thomaeus as its first official lecturer on the Greek text of Aristotle. In 1504, he was elected to succeed Giorgio Valla as chair of Greek in Venice, but because Thomaeus failed to take the post seriously, he was succeeded in 1512 by Marcus Musurus. In 1524, Thomaeus published a collection of philosophical dialogues in Latin, the first of which was titled \\"Trophonius, sive, De divinatione\\". He was admired by scholars such as Desiderius Erasmus for his philological capabilities. When the University of Padua was reopened after the wars of the League of Cambrai, Thomaeus taught at the university until his death on March 28, 1531.

It lies in the Rotherbaum quarter of the Eimsb√ºttel borough in Hamburg at the Rothenbaumchaussee avenue. History The museum originated as a small ethnographic collection of the city library, begun in 1849. This collection later became part of the Museum for Natural History in Hamburg, and in 1867 was opened to the public as \\"Die Ethnographische oder Sammlung f√ºr V√∂lkerkunde im Anschluss an das Naturhistorische Museum in Hamburg\\". The collection, which at that time numbered 645 objects, was curated by Adolph Oberd√∂rfer and Ferdinand Worl√©e. 1871 saw the renaming of the collection to \\"Culturhistorisches Museum\\", so that it progressed from the \\"Naturhistorisches Museum\\". On 29 April 1879 the \\"Museums f√ºr V√∂lkerkunde\\" was founded. At first the businessman Carl W. L√ºders led the museum in the position of provost until 1896. On 1 October 1904 Georg Thilenius took over the position of full-time administrative director of the \\"Museums f√ºr V√∂lkerkunde und Vorgeschichte\\". Georg Thilenius strongly supported the building of a freestanding museum to house the collection. Once approved, the construction lasted between 1908 and 1912, with an expansion to house workspace completed in 1929.

It lies southeast of DeRidder on the corner of Louisiana highways 113 and 394. Dry Creek is above sea level. The geography of the area is slightly hilly, ranging from above sea level, consisting of mostly sandy soils with many creeks (not all dry) and ponds. Dry Creek is at the beginning of the \\"piney woods\\" of central Louisiana. Logging is the major industry of the area. The area is locally noted for Sugartown melons. Bundick Lake Bundick Lake is located approximately north/northwest of \\"downtown\\" Drycreek. Dry Creek Baptist Camp Dry Creek Baptist Camp is located at the corner of the two highways across from the only grocery store in the community, with a Pentecostal Church on the north side and a Bible Church on the south side of its boundary. Education Dry Creek is a part of the Beauregard Parish School Board. Children in the area attend East Beauregard Elementary School and East Beauregard High School, north. Historic Buildings Referred to as the \\"White House\\", the Dry Creek School, currently owned by Dry Creek Baptist Camp, is an imposing neo-Greco building,. Built in 1912, the wings and columns of the building were added in 1919-1920. The school closed in 1962 when the Sugartown school and the Dry Creek school consolidated into East Beauregard School. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places January 28, 1988.  Early History of Dry Creek  Although no longer existing, the Dry Creek sawmill, built in 1841 for the expressed purpose of supplying lumber for doors and furnishings of the first Calcasieu Parish courthouse, was located on Mill Bayou, about one-fourth mile south of the current Dry Creek Cemetery. Both the sawmill site and Dry Creek Cemetery are located near a trail connecting Lake Charles to Natchitoches and used as a mail route between Lake Charles, Sugartown, and Vernon Parish communities in the 1840s. Legend has it that the first burial in Dry Creek Cemetery occurred in 1860 or 1861 and was an eleven or twelve-year- old girl whose family was traveling through the area and buried her by a small young cedar tree in a pasture area near the trail. Some believe the old trail runs through the middle of the cemetery and slightly east of the cedar tree. The Spears family (L.D. Spears, Sr.) came to Dry Creek in the 1870s, bought federally-owned property including site of the cemetery, and established the Dry Creek Cemetery (formerly Spears Cemetery) as a community cemetery in 1880. It is believed that L.D. Spears, Sr., gave permission for Ella Burnett, the infant niece of Lucy Cooper (discussed later), to be buried near the cedar tree in 1880. During the early years of Dry Creek, the Lindsey Cemetery, established in 1861, recorded several 1860s and 1870s burials. Thomas Williams, founder of Dry Creek, and his wife are believed to be buried somewhere on the original William Hanchey property, formerly Williams' homestead. Williams and his wife died before 1860, and their children had left Dry Creek. The historic sawmill was built by Williams, considered the first settler of Dry Creek in the 1830s and first police juror of Ward 7 (Sugartown Ward) of Imperial Calcasieu Parish, created in 1840 from St. Landry Parish. The Hanchey family is said to have acquired Williams' property years after his death in latter half of 1850s. The Hanchey family settled in Dry Creek between 1861-1865. Sources indicate that the Hanchey family may have lived in the Topsy area near Marsh Bayou for a short period of time before moving to Dry Creek.  Beginning of Dry Creek Cemetery: What Records Indicate  The Hanchey, associated Pate and Bradford families, and Cooper family came to northern Vernon from Holmes County, Florida (along the Florida and Alabama boundary), at the same time in 1860 (1850 Fl. Census records and 1860 La. Census records). The 1860 Census records these families living in neighboring houses northeast of Leesville near the intersection of two trails (one from Natchitoches to Lake Charles and another extending from Cotile Landing (present-day Boyce), a steamboat landing on the Red River, to East Texas. Census records and Turner genealogy also show that Edith Crumpler Cooper, mother of Lucy, had family members living in the same northern Vernon area since 1852 (three sisters married to the Turners who later moved to present- day Allen Parish and a brother). The Turners and Crumpler sisters and brother lived in Holmes County, Florida, before they took a long journey by wagon to Louisiana in 1852. Also, there is mention in genealogy of the Hanchey family that ancestors traveled by boat from Mobile to Louisiana. It is likely that all four of these families may have been traveling together and may have continued to travel southward by wagon through Dry Creek in the summer of 1860 (July or August) on their way to Marsh Bayou, northeast of Lake Charles. Several old Hanchey obituaries (over 100 years old) indicate the family first settled a few miles northeast of Lake Charles near the Calcasieu River in 1860. Although this is only speculation, one Hanchey family member believes that there is some connection to the girl buried under the cedar tree. The grave by the cedar is in the center of the original Cooper family plot with marked graves dating back to the 1880s on three sides, and appears to be the grave of an 11 to 12-year-old girl described in the legend and identified in 1860 Census records of the Cooper family as Lucy Ann Cooper, approximately 12 years of age. It is not known if the Cooper family remained long at Marsh Bayou or returned to northern Vernon, as tax and property records for these areas were destroyed by the burning of Alexandria during the Civil War and the Lake Charles Fire in the early 1900s, but Property Tax Records of Angelina County, Texas, show that the family lived in Angelina County, Texas (Lufkin area) after the Civil War (1866-1873),then returning to Dry Creek. All four families returned to Dry Creek, and many were buried within the shade or sight of the now ancient cedar tree, estimated to be 162-178 years old, a witness tree to the long history of Dry Creek.  Dry Creek, One of Oldest Beauregard Communities  Both the Lindsey and Dry Creek cemeteries in the community recorded their first burials in 1860-61 and are still used today. The first church/school was said to have been built in 1860. The 1860-61 time period records developments indicating the beginning of a community. Dry Creek is one of the oldest communities in Beauregard Parish. Sugartown (1820s) is the oldest, and the Hopewell community established a church and cemetery in the 1850s, with the first log church erected near Dollar Branch in 1852. Other than the Williams family whose members were either deceased or had left the community by the late 1850s, the Iles, Lindsey, and Miller families were the first to live in Dry Creek before 1860 (late 1850s). One source on Lindsey family genealogy lists 1859 as the year the Lindsey and Miller families came to Dry Creek from north Louisiana. The 1860 Census records of Imperial Calcasieu Parish do confirm that these three families were living in Dry Creek in the summer of 1860. = Notable people = * James David Cain, former member of both houses of the Louisiana Legislature *Dorothy Sue Hill, current state representative for Beauregard, Allen, and Calcasieu parishes; rancher and retired educator in her native Dry Creek *Herman Ray Hill, former state representative for Beauregard, Allen, and Calcasieu parishes; rancher and retired educator in Dry Creek; husband of current Representative Dorothy Hill = References  External links = *Dry Creek Baptist Camp website Unincorporated communities in Beauregard Parish, Louisiana Unincorporated communities in Louisiana School buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Louisiana National Register of Historic Places in Beauregard Parish, Louisiana ","title":"Dry Creek, Louisiana"},{"id":"23751792","text":"Lasthenia platycarpha is a species of flowering plant in the daisy family known by the common name alkali goldfields.

The environment of Malaysia is the biotas and geologies that constitute the natural environment of Malaysia. Malaysia's ecology is megadiverse, with a biodiverse range of flora and fauna found in various ecoregions throughout the country. Tropical rainforests encompass between 59% to 70% of Malaysia's total land area, of which 11.6% is pristine. Malaysia has the world's fifth largest mangrove area, which totals over a half a million hectares (over 1.2 million acres). Human intervention poses a significant threat to the natural environment of this country. Agriculture, forestry and urbanisation contribute to the destruction of forests, mangroves and other thriving ecosystems in the country. Ecosystems and landscapes are dramatically altered by human development, including the construction of roads and damming of rivers. Geographical phenomena, such as landslides and flooding in the Klang Valley, along with haze, stem from widespread deforestation. Subtle climate change occurs as a direct result of air pollution and the greenhouse effect, which in turn is caused by the emission of greenhouse gases. Low-lying areas near the coastline of Sabah and Sarawak are under threat from current sea level rise. The environment is the subject of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment at the federal level. The Department of Wildlife and National Parks is responsible for the preservation of flora and fauna in Malaysia. Several environmental organisations have been established to raise awareness regarding the environmental issues in Malaysia. Biota The rafflesia can be found in the jungles of Malaysia. Malaysia is home to 15500 species of higher plants, 746 birds, 379 reptiles, 198 amphibians, and 368 species of fish. There are also 286 species of mammals in Malaysia, of which 27 are endemic and 51 are threatened. Some of these mammals are found in both Peninsular Malaysia and Malaysian Borneo. The former has 193 species of mammals, while the latter has 215. Among the mammals that are native to Malaysia include the Asian elephant, the Indochinese tiger, the leopard cat and the pot-bellied pig. Endangered species include the orangutan, the tiger, the Asian elephant, the Malayan tapir, the Sumatran rhinoceros and the Singapore roundleaf horseshoe bat. The tropical moist broadleaf forests of Peninsular Malaysia consist of 450 species of birds and over 6000 different species of trees, of which 1000 are vascular plants that occur naturally in karsts. The rainforests of East Malaysia are denser, with over 400 species of tall dipterocarps and semihardwoods. The national flower of Malaysia is the Hibiscus rosa-sinensis, an evergreen that was introduced into the Malay peninsula in the 12th century. The rafflesia is also widely found in the country. =Ecoregions and land use= There are various ecoregions in Malaysia with varying degrees of prevalence. Major forests account for 45% of all ecoregions in the country, interrupted woods represent 33%, major wetlands constitute 3%, grass and shrubs make up 2% while other coastal aquatic regions form 8% of the country's land area, with crops and settlements taking up the remaining space. Malaysia has many national parks, although most of them are de facto state parks. The Taman Negara National Park in central Peninsular Malaysia is 130 million years old, making it one of the oldest rainforests in the world. About 41% of the land area is classified as \\"low human disturbance\\", 19% is categorised as \\"medium human disturbance\\" and 40% falls under the \\"high human disturbance\\" category. 2.7% of the land is totally protected, 1.77% is partially protected and 4.47% is totally or partially protected. Climate The precipitation map of Peninsular Malaysia in December 2004 shows heavy precipitation on the east coast, causing floods there. Malaysia lies along the 1st parallel north to the 7th parallel north circles of latitude, roughly equal to Roraima (Brazil), the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Kenya. According to the K√∂ppen climate classification system, Malaysia has a tropical rainforest climate due to its proximity to the equator. The country is hot and humid all year round, with an average temperature of and almost no variability in the yearly temperature. The country experiences two monsoon seasons, the Northeast Monsoon and the Southwest Monsoon. The Northeast Monsoon brings heavy rainfall to the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia and western Sarawak, while the Southwest Monsoon signifies dryer conditions throughout the country except Sabah. During the Southwest Monsoon, most states experience minimal rainfall due to the stable atmospheric conditions in the region and the Sumatran mountain range, which brings about the rain shadow effect. Sabah experiences more rainfall because of the tail effect of typhoons in the Philippines. The urban heat island effect is caused by overdevelopment and general human activities in the cities of Malaysia. =Air Pollution Index= The Air Pollution Index (API) is used by the government to describe the air quality in Malaysia. The API value is calculated based on average concentrations of air pollutants, namely sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, ozone and fine dust (PM10). The air pollutant with the highest concentration is the pollutant that will determine the value of the API. Fine dust is typically the dominant pollutant. The API is reported on a scale starting from 0. A score of 0 to 50 is considered good, 51 to 100 is moderate, 101 to 200 is unhealthy, 201 to 300 is very unhealthy and anything higher than 300 is hazardous. A state of emergency is declared in the reporting area if the API exceeds 500, which occurred in Port Klang in 2005. Non-essential government services are suspended, and all ports and schools in the affected area are closed. Private sector commercial and industrial activities in the reporting area might be prohibited. Environmental law and conservation The Environmental Quality Act of 1974 and other environmental laws are administered by the Division of Environment. Clean-air legislation was adopted in 1978, limiting industrial and automobile emissions. However, air pollutant remains a problem in Malaysian cities. The National Forestry Act of 1984 was enacted for sustainable forest management, but the act has not been enforced. =Treaties and international agreements= Malaysia is a party to the following international environmental agreements: Malaysia signed but did not ratify the Kyoto Protocol on climate change. =Environmental organisations= The following is a non-exhaustive list of several non-governmental organisations devoted to the preservation and conservation of the environment in Malaysia: Environmental issues The 2005 Malaysian haze over Kuala Lumpur. Haze is one of the most serious environmental issues in Malaysia. There are a number of environmental issues faced by Malaysia, such as deforestation and pollution. According to a study by Centre for Marine and Coastal Studies in 2008, about 30% of Malaysian coastline is subject to varying degrees of erosion. According to the United Nations, Malaysia's deforestation rate is the highest among tropical nations. The country's annual deforestation rate increased 86% between 1999‚Äì2000 and 2000‚Äì2005. Malaysia lost an average of 140,200 hectares of its forests or 0.65% of its total forest area every year since 2000, whereas in the 1990s, the country lost an average of 78,500 hectares, or 0.35 percent of its forests annually. Widespread urbanisation, agricultural fires and forest conversion for oil palm plantations and other forms of agriculture are the main causes of Malaysia's high deforestation rate. Logging is responsible for forest degradation in the country, and local timber companies have been accused by environmental organisations of failing to practice sustainable forest management. Mining in peninsular Malaysia has left a mark on the environment. Deforestation, pollution of rivers, and siltation have resulted in losses of agriculture, and road projects have opened new areas to colonisation. Air pollution from industrial and vehicular emissions is a major issue in the urban areas of Malaysia. Malaysia is ranked 42nd in the world in terms of vehicle ownership per capita, with 273 Malaysians having vehicles out of every 1000. Public transportation has been introduced in the form of bus networks and railway systems as mitigation, but utilisation rates are low. Water pollution occurs due to the discharge of untreated sewage; the west coast of the Peninsular Malaysia is the most heavily populated area. 40% of the rivers in Malaysia are heavily polluted. The country has 580 cubic km of water, of which 76% is used for farming and 13% is used for industrial activity. Cities in Malaysia produce an average of 1.5 million tons of solid waste per year. In 2000, Malaysia was ranked fourth in the world in terms of per capita greenhouse gas emissions after taking into account land use change with 37.2 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per capita. Periodic fires, which usually coincide with the events of el Ni√±o, burn thousands of hectares of forests across Malaysia, especially in Malaysian Borneo. The haze originating from these fires and the fires in Kalimantan, Indonesia typically have adverse health effects on the populace, besides causing air pollution. In particular, the 1997 Southeast Asian haze, the 2005 Malaysian haze and the 2006 Southeast Asian haze were caused by slash and burn activities in neighbouring Indonesia. On 23 June 2013, the air pollutant index (API) in Muar, Johor has spiked to 746 as of 7.00am, which is more than twice the standard hazardous levels according to the Department of Environment website on Sunday. Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak has agreed to declare emergency status in Muar and Ledang with immediate effect after the API readings reached more than 750. He stated that the haze is due to the open-burning in Indonesia and he offered cloud seeding for them. However the Indonesian Environment Minister Balthasar Kambuaya has identified eight companies with Malaysian links that are being investigated for burning in Riau and Jambi, that has led to the haze that is choking neighbouring countries Malaysia and Singapore. All schools in Selangor and Kuala Lumpur are also called to close for a day due to the haze situation worsening as of 5pm. The highest API ever recorded in Malaysia was in Sarawak in 1997 with a reading of 860. The Minister of Natural Resources and Environment Minister Datuk Seri G. Palanivel was flayed by Penang Chief Minister Lim Guan Eng for prioritising the pandas more than Malaysians, a RM25 million exhibition centre will be completed by November and two pandas will be transported from China. The minister also announced that he would be meeting his Indonesian counterpart this Wednesday to discuss about solutions to overcome the haze problem.

Training inputs have been provided to all village health workers of TF. TF has also been enlisted to provide training to members of Village Health and Sanitation Committees of Village Gram Panchayats of all the villages of Umreth, Anklav and Anand talukas of Anand District and Balasinor and Virpur talukas of Kheda District during the financial year 08-09. The Gujarat state government has provided grants for this project of around Rs.1100,000 (eleven lakhs or one million one hundred thousand rupees). Apart from community health, TF also has programs for children, (Balwadi program) and for livelihood enhancement of women (handicrafts). TF also has organised anti tobacco campaigns in its program villages.

The town of Stanley, Idaho is northeast of the peak. Views of the peak may be accessed from the scenic Idaho State Highway 75, and on hiking trails from Redfish Lake and throughout the Sawtooth and White Cloud Mountains. History Williams Peak is named for pioneer Dave Williams, who was a part of the first ascent team in 1934 along with Robert and Miriam Underhill.Lopez, Tom. Idaho: A Climbing Guide. Seattle: The Mountaineers Books, 2000, p. 160 Williams also owned the property of what is now the Idaho Rocky Mountain Ranch, which looks toward the peak. Routes Various routes are available for hikers and climbers as the mountain's southern slopes and ridgelines offer challenging and exciting scrambling, while the steep North Face offers the peak's classic alpine climb with over or 9 pitches of steep climbing. 1) The June/ North Couloir (III 5.7) - This prominent steep couloir cuts up the northeast face to a notch just below the summit. It's fairly easy access from the Alpine Way Trail near Marshall Lake. The couloir often has ice, rock, and snow and is blocked by a large cornice in the winter near the top. The first ascent came in 1986 by Kirk Bachman and B. Franklin. Rope up at the base of the couloir and expect highly variable conditions on snow and ice. The route is straightforward. At the top of the couloir, follow the ridge to the west and then the south to the summit. It's only from the top of the couloir to the summit proper. The easiest descent is to utilize the south facing routes to get back to the trail. 2) Southeast Slopes (Class 3) - Easy access from the Alpine Way Trail make this method probably the easiest and quickest route on the mountain. Winter time offers great snow climbing and ski descents here. 3) East Ridge (Class 4) - A more challenging route involves up and down scrambling on the prominent southeast ridge above the Southeast Slopes route. There are sections of extreme exposure and steep, loose gullies to cross over. Mountain Goats were encountered on this route. 4) Southwest Couloir (Class 3) - This route is readily accessible from the Thompson / Williams Saddle (Thompson and Williams can be done together) or the Lake 8865 area.

He is most famous for inventing the Savage Model 99 lever-action rifle, which remained in production for over 100 years, and founding Savage Arms. However, his most lasting and valuable inventions may be radial tires,, May 21, 1915, Vehicle Tire, Inventor Arthur W. Savage and it has been argued, the modern detachable box magazine used in almost all modern military firearms. He also invented an early torpedo and built and raced cars. Early life He was born in Kingston, Jamaica, British West Indies. His father was Welsh, a special commissioner to the West Indies, charged with setting up an educational system for the slaves emancipated in 1834.Kimmel, Jay, \\"Savage & Stevens Arms: Collector's History\\" Cory Stevens Publishing, Travels In the late 1880s he took his family to Australia, homesteading in a covered wagon. He came to own what was then the largest cattle ranch in Australia. Eleven years later he sold it and bought a coffee plantation in Jamaica. In 1892 he moved to Utica, New York, and hired himself to a railroad, the Utica Belt Line Street Railroad (See List of New York railroads). He also got part-time work at a gun factory, the Utica Hammer Magazine Company. Savage Arms Savage and his son Arthur John began designing guns. His first model in 1887 was a lever-action rifle with the magazine in the stock, rather than under the barrel., July 12, 1887, Lever Action Gun, Single-shot or Magazine, Inventor Arthur W. Savage. Six years later, he patented a lever- action rifle able to shoot then-modern guncotton military center-fire cartridges with .303-caliber spitzer bullets., July 26, 1893, Hammerless Rifle, Inventor: Arthur W. Savage; It was called the 'Model 95' because production started in 1895. This \\"Model 95\\" was the direct predecessor of the Savage Model 99. Savage invented a novel rotary magazine rifle. A benefit of this magazine was that it had a cartridge counter on the left side of the receiver that enabled the shooter to tell how many cartridges remained in the magazine. Lacking sufficient manufacturing capacity the first 9600 ( plus or minus ) Model 1895 rifles were contracted to be built by Marlin Repeating Arms and are so marked with the JM proof mark. In 1894, Savage started Savage Arms in rented space on Hubbell street in Utica, New York to produce his new rifle. Slightly later, in 1897, he filed for the patent on a nearly identical gun with a removable box magazine. This is substantially the modern Savage Model 99 lever-action rifle., Firearm, Filed: Apr 21, 1897, Granted Oct. 3, 1899, Inventor: Arthur W. Savage It stayed in production until 1999. The modern removable box magazine often seen on military rifles was invented in 1908 by Savage, as an improvement to the Model 99., April 28, 1908, Improved Magazine, Inventor: Arthur W. Savage It did not come into wide use until his patent expired in 1942 with the obvious exception of the family of rifles designed by James Paris Lee and adopted by the USN and the British Empire; first as the Lee‚ÄìMetford and later as the Lee‚ÄìEnfield rifles. The box magazine has many attractive features that ensured its eventual dominance: shoulders to retain cartridges when it is removed from the rifle, operates reliably with cartridges of different lengths and is insertable and removable at any time with any number of cartridges. This allows the operator to reload the gun infrequently, carry magazines rather than loose cartridges, and to easily change the types of cartridges. It is assembled from inexpensive stamped sheet metal. When empty the followerThe \\"follower\\" is the sheet metal part between the last cartridge and the spring. stops the bolt from engaging the chamber, informing the operator of the gun's emptiness before any attempt to fire. Savage collaborated on the invention of the Savage-Halpine torpedo,, September 27, 1891, Torpedo, Inventor Arthur W. Savage which was eventually adopted by the Brazilian navy. Although U.S. sea trials were successful, it was not adopted in the U.S., due to political considerations.

Early life Oriani-Ambrosini was born in Rome in 1960. He was the son of Columbia University trained constitutional law professor and international lawyer Raffaele Oriani, who died in 1971, at 39. He was then adopted and raised by his grand-uncle Gaspare Ambrosini, an Italian founding father, jurist and statesman, who presided over the Italian Constitutional Court. Oriani- Ambrosini's education was influenced by his grand uncles, Vittorio Ambrosini a founder of the Italian arditi, and Antonio Ambrosini, an international law professor credited as the architect of the Warsaw Convention. On the paternal side, he was related to Alfredo Oriani, a futurist who subscribed to the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche. Even though his adoptive father was a leader of Democrazia Cristiana, Oriani-Ambrosini spent his teenage political activism under the wing of Marco Pannella, the leader of the Italian nonviolent radical, environmentalist and libertarian movement. Oriani- Ambrosini maintained a lifelong association with it and was a member of its General Council. Oriani-Ambrosini attended the Sapienza University of Rome, Harvard University and Georgetown University Law Center. Over a three-year period at Rome University, he assisted former President of the Italian Constitutional Court, Professor Francesco Paolo Bonifacio, with seminars on constitutional justice. He conducted research under the direction of the Secretary of the Italian Parliament, Guglielmo Negri, for the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche and the Italian Chamber of Deputies on the US environmental system and the National Environmental Policy Act Le municipalit√† statunitensi e il governo dell'ambiente a livello locale In: Studi parlamentari e di politica costituzionale. n. 68(1985), p. 71 et seq. to support the drafting of an EEC directive and assess its compatibility with the Italian constitutional framework. Oriani-Ambrosini also assisted Prof. Nicola Greco in his conducting of seminars which focused on public enterprise law at the Universita' di Pisa. From the age of 17, Oriani-Ambrosini worked in the family law firm preparing written legal briefs and arguments. After winning a Fulbright scholarship, Oriani-Ambrosini relocated to the United States to specialize in constitutional law and international financial and commercial law. In 1986, he became the right-hand man of Rutgers University law professor, Albert Blaustein, an international constitutional consultant who participated in the writing of over 30 constitutions worldwide. He assisted Blaustein in a graduate seminar on constitution's drafting and became the Vice President of the Philadelphia Foundation and the public-advocacy UN-accredited law-firm Human Rights Advocates International, both presided over by Blaustein. He engaged in constitutional negotiation, lobbying, and public interest litigation in respect of Nicaragua (electoral law), the Russian Federation (preparation of the first draft constitution), Canada (position of Indian tribes in the national constitution and the tribes' own constitutions), Uganda, Fiji (constitution drafting), Romania (representing Alliancia Civica), Poland, Rom Nation, Italy (constitutional reports), the Moluccan Nation (Government in exile), Macedonia (representing VMRO), Cuba (shadow Government), Tibet (Government in Exile), proposed State of Humania, Seychelles (constitutional advisor to Sir James Mancham) and Zaire (Advisor to Paramount Chief Logotongo III).

Oriani-Ambrosini? in Virginias Business February 1992 Lawyer Although his career had always been politics and constitutional law, Oriani-Ambrosini made his living as a commercial lawyer and a businessman. Soon after his arrival in Washington, D.C., he became \\"of counsel\\" in the small but specialized international law firm of Hanna, Gaspar & Birkel, dealing with international commercial and financial transactions, including interest rates arbitrage, corporate and contractual negotiation, civil litigation in commercial matters and torts.The Washington Lawyer: New Global Lawyers Hanna & Oriani, January 1990 He began a lifelong friendship with businessman Peter J. Knop and became the General Counsel of the Washington D.C Knop Organization then consisting of TFI, SWPP Development Corp., Agricycle, Inc. and Avenir Corp. He served as the managing director of SWPP and Acrycle, dealing with venture capital and investment management, advising on the structuring of ventures, as well as waste recycling and agribusiness in a highly regulated and litigation-prone environment. Together with Knop he created a $10 million per year business which was involved in lobbying, litigation and government relations. Politics In 1991 he began what would become a life-changing relationship with Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi. In December 1990, he acted as the legal advisor for the Inkatha Freedom Party at the opening of CODESA, the two-year-long South African constitutional negotiations from apartheid to democracy. In June 1992, he sat with Buthelezi at the meeting of the UN Security Council in a meeting called by Nelson Mandela to push forward the transition to democracy. In November 1992 he drafted the Constitution of KwaZulu/Natal which was unanimously adopted by the KwaZulu Legislative Assembly as the constitution of a member state of a federation to be formed in the national negotiation process. This was the first detailed constitutional draft or proposal in the South African constitution-making process and in that process, helped to advance civil liberties such as abortion, gay rights and a ban on the death penalty, as well as second and third generation human rights which until that point were not part of the South African constitutional discourse. For three years Oriani- Ambrosini worked full-time as the chief constitutional negotiator for the IFP and the erstwhile KwaZulu Government, and was involved in all stages and phases of the negotiation from its beginning to the end of pre-election negotiations, including the entire drafting of the 1994 interim Constitution. He played a key role in the international mediation effort led by Henry Kissinger and Lord Carrington and the negotiation of the Agreement for Reconciliation and Peace which enabled an all-inclusive democratic election in 1994.Ben Temkin, Buthelezi: A biography, pages 293 et seq. as well as the finalization of the South African Constitution. After South Africa's first democratic elections, Buthelezi became South Africa's Minister of Home Affairs and the Leader of a minority party in Mandela's Government of National Unity. Oriani-Ambrosini was then appointed as Buthelezi's sole Cabinet Adviser. He held this position for 10 years, providing advise for all issues before Cabinet and in Parliament, including the negotiation and drafting of the final national Constitution, the adoption of hundreds of comprehensive legislative reforms and policy documents transforming almost all fields of government and civil society. He co-drafted film and publication laws, citizenship amendment laws, homosexual life partnership and customary union regulations and other reforms which carry a libertarian slant. Oriani-Ambrosini is acknowledged as being the main, if not the sole, architect of the South African immigration reform process from 1996 to 2004. He was appointed by Buthelezi as a Member of the task force formulating the new South African immigration policy where he became the drafter of both the policy and the new legislation. He was also responsible for piloting the legislation through NEDLAC and Parliament,Page redirection acting as the Ministers spokesperson in this often controversial process. He then drafted the interim immigration regulations and piloted the subsequent process of consultations for the final regulations. In Home Affairs, he advised the Minister regarding all policy matters as well as the management of a 7000 plus person Department during the tenure of six Director- Generals. He was intimately involved in the structuring of the electronic universal population and fingerprints registry (\\"HANIS\\") and related national ID card, as well as the departmental restructuring to devolve civil affairs delivery aspects to municipalities and in all aspects of the Department's policies and legislation.Cat-And-Mouse Game At Home Affairs Oriani-Ambrosini promoted the first high level security cooperation between his Department and U.S. security and negotiated high-level cooperation with Australia in refugee affairs. During his ten years in the South African government, Oriani- Ambrosini's responsibilities were not limited to Home Affairs. In that period he advised the Province of KwaZulu Natal, including negotiating and drafting the 1996 provincial Constitution of KwaZulu Natal, a number of pieces of legislation adopted by the provincial legislature and several of the province's constitutional litigations. With Director General R. Sizani, he spearheaded the legal and administrative implementation of KwaZulu Natal's historical defiance of President's Thabo Mbeki's dictate that no lifesaving- antiretroviral drugs were to be given within the public system to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV-AIDS. He also advised the Coalition of Traditional Leaders and precursory groupings of traditional leaders and partook in all major activities of the governing and policy making bodies of the IFP, including re-drafting most of the Party's constitution and supporting all the IFP's annual party conferences. Throughout this period, Oriani- Ambrosini partook in high-level and State trips to Germany, Canada, Russia, the United Kingdom, Israel, Morocco, Italy, Taiwan, Indonesia, Australia, Belgium, Austria, the Netherlands, the United States, Portugal, France and Bulgaria, and was member of the Government of South Africa's delegation at three high-level United Nations conferences as well as numerous international visits and conventions. Oriani-Ambrosini also directed, managed and/or engineered over 45 major constitutional and high-profile civil litigation cases on behalf of the IFP, the KwaZulu Natal Government and the Department of Home Affairs. Oriani-Ambrosini left the South African Government in May 2004 to reopen his Washington, D.C. office and establish Ambrosini & Associates a legal and business consultancy. He established Promethea Corporation, a philanthropic company which manufactured safe kerosene cookers in Vietnam and distributed them in Africa to replace unsafe versions used by millions of people.http://www.promethea.biz While focusing on rebuilding his legal practice and setting up business ventures in China, Vietnam, Europe and South Africa, Oriani-Ambrosini continued to advise Buthelezi on policy and institutional matters. During this period, he drafted the IFP's proposed 2005 Constitution for KwaZulu Natal, Buthelezi's constitutional amendments Bill to separate the offices of Head of State and Head of Government and several other policy documents. He also participated in the 4th World Parliamentary Convention on Tibet and directed successful public interest constitutional litigation. He became a Member of the National Assembly of South Africa in May 2009 where he served on the following Committees: Trade and Industry, Public Enterprises, Economic Development, Justice and Constitutional Development Portfolio, Finance and Rules, Private Members Bills and the Constitutional Review Joint Committees. Oriani-Ambrosini brought to the South African Parliament the spirit and methodology of nonviolent democratic radicalism. He organized and single-handedly executed the first filibuster in South African parliamentary history, which forced a four-month delay in the passing of the controversial Protection of State Information Bill - South Africa's secrecy law. He challenged the constitutionality of the Rules of Parliament in a three-year-long multi stage litigation which culminated in a landmark Constitutional Court decision which declared the unconstitutionality of all the Rules of Parliament which prevented a single Member of Parliament from introducing legislation.[e-Library OPAC] He intervened as an amicus curiae in the constitutional litigation which barred the extension of the term of office of the Chief Justice and in litigation determining the measure of freedom of speech allowed in Parliament. He also used the tool of requesting the President not to assent legislation to return it to Parliament on constitutional grounds, which the President did with respect of the controversial Intellectual Property Law Amendment Bill which would take out of the public domain indigenous folklore and traditional knowledge. Oriani- Ambrosini was one of the six founding members and a director of the Parliamentary Institute of South Africa (PISA) a tax-exempt,cross-party parliamentary forum, which facilitates meaningful dialogue amongst serving and former parliamentarians,captains of industry, opinion makers, leaders of civil society, academics and diplomats. Oriani-Ambrosini was part of INPaT, (the international Network of Parliamentarians'on Tibet) an action group established and mandated at the World Parliamentary Conference on Tibet. He has visited Tibetan camps in India and has been an outspoken advocate of human rights protection in Tibet, often publicly challenging the Chinese government to allow an international parliamentary fact-finding mission to have unfettered access to Tibet. He led his party leader's successful lawsuit against the ANC, which found the South African government's repeated denial of an entry visa to the Dalai Lama to be wrongful. Oriani-Ambrosini published extensively on economic and financial matters, advocating a libertarian model for the realization of a just and fair society. His thinking, expressed in his Libertarian Manifesto, endorses the role of the state in providing free and universal access to services such as education, health and social assistance, but suggests that the state ought to operate or own no delivery infrastructure or facility. He has advocated the reform of the monetary system to substitute debt-based banknotes with government issued debt-free notes in a system which no longer allows banking fractional reserve.Letter To The Deputy President From Mario G.R. Oriani-Ambrosini. MP Oriani-Ambrosini maintained his legal practice in the US, albeit remotely, as well as a standing political association with the US libertarian movement. In 2013 he became a partner in the South African office of Translink, a Swiss-based international corporate finance firm specializing in mergers and acquisition with 30 offices worldwide.Translink Corporate Finance At the time of his death Oriana- Ambrosini was a citizen of the United States, Italy and South Africa and was fluent in both English and Italian.

Educational leadership  Eichner graduated from Chaminade High School in Mineola, New York, in 1953. He received his undergraduate degree at the University of Dayton and his graduate degree in theology from the University of Fribourg, in Switzerland, and he was ordained in 1966, From 1967 to 1992 he served as president of his high school alma mater, Chaminade.

In 1980, Eichner petitioned the New York State Court of Appeals to allow removal of a respirator keeping Brother Joseph C. Fox alive. Fox, an 88-year-old member of the religious community that Eichner led, had fallen into a coma after a cardiac arrest that occurred during a hernia operation. In the wake of the Karen Ann Quinlan case, Fox had expressed his strong desire not to be kept alive by extraordinary means, according to Eichner and other Marianist brothers at Chaminade. The court appointed Eichner ‚Äúcommittee of the person of Brother Fox‚Äù and authorized him to have the respirator removed. He did so, and on January 24, 1980, Fox died of congestive heart failure. Another issue on which Eichner has spoken out is ‚Äúfinancial decadence,‚Äù particularly in Long Island ‚Äúprom culture.‚Äù In 2006, after Kellenberg discontinued the senior prom, Eichner and Kellenberg Principal Kenneth Hoagland, S.M., wrote parents to say that the prom had become synonymous with ‚Äúflaunting of affluence, assuming exaggerated expenses, a pursuit of vanity for vanity's sake.‚Äù The letter was published on the Chicago Tribune op-ed page and received national attention.Ann Hulbert, ‚ÄúTake Back the Prom,‚Äù Slate, http://slate.msn.com/id/2129379/ Eichner has also received attention for positions he has taken as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Catholic League, though League President Bill Donohue is the organization‚Äôs more outspoken and controversial leader. Eichner has spoken for the League on two matters related to Catholic-Jewish relations. First, in 2004, when accusations of anti-Semitism were raised against Mel Gibson‚Äôs The Passion of the Christ, Eichner was a strong public supporter of the film.\\"The Passion of the Christ\\" Sets New Records,‚Äù Catalyst, Volume 31, Issue 3: April 2004, http://www.catholicleague.org/Passion/0404b_cat.htm Eichner called the film ‚Äúa meditation on our own inhumanity to each other and how this doesn't destroy God's love,\\" and he endorsed a two-mile walk by 1,000 Kellenberg upperclassmen to see the movie on Ash Wednesday.Alison Gendar, February 19, 2004 ‚ÄúCatholics Want Mel‚Äôs Movie With Passion,‚Äù New York Daily News, http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2004/02/19/2004-02-19_catholics_want_to_see_mel_fi.html Second, Eichner defended a reference to the ‚Äúconversion of Jews‚Äù in the traditional Latin liturgy for Good Friday Mass. He called this a matter not of anti-Semitism, but of concern; \\"we would say,‚Äù he explained, that ‚Äúeveryone who doesn't see Jesus is living in a certain amount of darkness, and we want them to see the light.\\" http://clericalwhispers.blogspot.com/2007/07/latin- mass-may-damage-catholic-jewish.html Similarly, Eichner has suggested that fundamentalist Christians are limited in their religious perspective. He made this point when a Kellenberg junior was barred from returning for her senior year after her evangelical family had clashed with the school over several religious issues. Her dismissal came after she refused to sing as a choir member in Jesus Christ, Superstar; she objected that one of the songs ‚Äúonly speaks of Jesus' humanity; it does not mention his divinity.\\" Eichner asserted that the school had a right to expect students to respect its religious beliefs and practices. He maintained that ‚ÄúWe are Catholic in the true sense of the term. We are not rightist or fundamentalist. We would find their version of Christianity to be narrow and fundamentalist, and we are not a fundamentalist school.\\" Doctrine Separates a Girl and Her School, Stewart Ain, New York Times, June 30, 2002, https://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/30/nyregion/doctrine-separates-a-girl-and-her- school.html?pagewanted=2 On August 5, 1988, Eichner was an impromptu guest on Late Night with David Letterman. During the broadcasthttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvwa_uLI-5c, Letterman and guest Don Rickles conducted remote camera interviews with people in the lobby of the Loews Summit hotel, one of whom was Eichner.

A member of the Kennedy family, he is the ninth child of Robert F. Kennedy and Ethel Skakel Kennedy. Early life  Kennedy is the ninth child of Robert F. Kennedy and Ethel Skakel Kennedy. He was born in New York City. Kennedy was baptized in the Catholic faith by William Jerome McCormack at St. Patrick's Cathedral in front of a crowd of 200 people. He is named after General Maxwell D. Taylor, then serving as the U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam. Kennedy attended Phillips Academy and after expulsion attended Moses Brown School in Providence, Rhode Island, graduating in 1983. He graduated from Harvard College where he majored in American history and was a member of the Spee Club of Harvard University, a Final Club. He married Victoria Anne Strauss (born February 10, 1964), the granddaughter of Maurice \\"Moe\\" Strauss on July 13, 1991, in Philadelphia. Both he and his wife graduated in 1992 from the University of Virginia School of Law, where he was elected president of the Student Legal Forum. Both his father and his uncle, Senator Ted Kennedy, had served as presidents of the Student Legal Forum. Career=Writing= Kennedy wrote the national best-selling book titled Make Gentle the Life of This World: The Vision of Robert F. Kennedy and the Words That Inspired Him. He is also the author of Danger's Hour: The Story of the USS Bunker Hill and the Kamikaze Pilot Who Crippled Her, which was released by Simon & Schuster on Veterans Day (November 11, 2008). The book garnered praise from filmmaker Ken Burns, journalist Tom Brokaw, and historians Walter Isaacson, Doris Kearns Goodwin, and Stanley Karnow. In collaboration with the Harvard documentary filmmaker Randolph Bell, he is writing, producing, and directing a documentary on the use of suicide as a weapon of war. His articles have appeared in DoubleTake Magazine, Conde Nast Traveller, and Escape Magazine. =Civil, human, and environmental rights work= Kennedy began his law career in July 1992, serving for three years as an assistant district attorney in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. As a director of the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial, Kennedy has led human rights missions to Haiti, South Africa, and Kenya. Kennedy co-founded the Urban Ecology Institute at Boston College, where he taught in the Biology and English Departments in attempts to inspire change through community action and education. In response to the considerable ecological and economic challenges in the city of Boston, the Urban Ecology Institute attempts to study the emerging field of urban ecology, with the intention of helping residents understand the natural resources in their communities and the actions that must be taken in order to protect them. An avid advocate for civil rights and environmental rights, Kennedy spoke at the Loyola Marymount University Bellarmine Forum in 2006 on the importance of urban ecology. Kennedy claimed that the Jesuit colleges should be more involved in their local communities, and that scientists, educators and attorneys must work with middle and high-school youth to improve science and civic education, so as to protect and transform the use of natural resources before they are lost forever. Kennedy is working with the Pearl Coalition to build a museum in remembrance and recognition of the largest non-violent escape attempt by slaves in American history, the Pearl Incident. While at Georgetown University, Kennedy concentrated on Latin-American history, and has made dozens of trips through Central and Latin America, spending time in nearly every country in South America. He joined a Venezuelan mapping team to attempt to create the first detailed maps of the upper reaches of the Rio Caroni. He co-led (with Barry Clifford) an expedition to locate the sunken French fleet of Admiral D\`Estress off the Las Aves Archipelago of Venezuela, and participated in the subsequent filming of the BBC/Discovery Channel Documentary about the lost fleet, which had sunk in 1678 while attempting to sack the Dutch at Cura√ßao. Max Kennedy partially financed and produced two Venezuelan historical feature films about Manuela Saenz in 2000 (Lover of Simon Bolivar and Colonel in the Venezuelan Independence Army) and Francisco de Miranda in 2005 (Leader of Venezuelan Independence). His name appears on the credits of both films and other Venezuelan films to which he has contributed. Kennedy has toured the Venezuelan Barrios, and was successfully involved in the fundraising of donations from the U.S. to the homeless children's shelter run by Fundaci√≥n Atenea in Caracas. Kennedy has had extensive meetings with Leopoldo Lopez, former Mayor of Chacao ‚Äì formerly one of the only elected opposition figures in Caracas ‚Äì and with Henrique Capriles, former Mayor of Baruta and current Governor of the State of Miranda. He has been a personal friend for more than 15 years to Maria Corina Machado, the head of SUMATE (a Venezuelan NGO that promotes clean elections), who has been indicted by the Government under several criminal charges for that reason. Kennedy worked as a research fellow at the John Carter Brown Library for Advanced Research in History and the Humanities at Brown University. =Politics= Although Kennedy has never run for public office, he has shown a consistent interest in public affairs, and has been involved in many campaigns, usually as a field organizer. Kennedy began working as a field organizer for the first congressional campaign of Joseph Patrick Kennedy II in 1986, where he organized wards in Allston and Brighton. Later, he managed the re-election campaign for Senator Edward M. Kennedy in 2000. Max Kennedy has volunteered on a number of other campaigns, including the presidential campaigns of Edward M. Kennedy in 1980; Michael Dukakis in 1988; Al Gore in 2000; John Kerry in 2004, and as a surrogate for Barack Obama in 2008. In 2001, the Boston and New York media touted Kennedy as a possible candidate for Massachusetts's 9th congressional district, a seat vacated by Democrat Joe Moakley. Kennedy never declared his candidacy, citing his desire to spend time with his family, including his three children under the age of 10. Maxwell Kennedy endorsed Senator Barack Obama early in the primary season, and campaigned for Senator Obama throughout 2008 at approximately 200 events in crucial swing states, including Ohio, Colorado, New Mexico, Virginia, and Pennsylvania. In Scranton, Pennsylvania, he visited diners and doughnut shops at six a.m. and led senior citizens in singing old Irish ballads at lunch centers; Kennedy campaigned in Indiana on Martin Luther King Jr. Day and again during the Jefferson-Jackson dinner; he campaigned also across Texas from Austin to Dallas and Fort Worth through San Antonio. He phone-banked for Senator Obama and spoke at several Rock the Vote Bus Tour events. He also introduced Senator Obama at a dinner in Hickory Hill. In October 2009, Kennedy announced that he would be endorsing Alan Khazei in the special election to fill the US Senate seat of his late uncle, Ted Kennedy. Kennedy was nominated by President Obama to serve as a Member of the Board of the Directors of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) on January 26, 2011. He was sworn into office by Elizabeth Littlefield, the President of OPIC in November 2011, and received a Security Clearance. Kennedy served on the Board until January 2018. Soon after, Kennedy and his wife Victoria moved to Chicago to work with his brother Chris Kennedy who was campaigning for Governor of Illinois. =Law= Kennedy works as counsel to the law firm of Strange and Butler LLP in Los Angeles, California. Personal life Kennedy married Victoria Anne Strauss on July 13, 1991 at the Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul in Philadelphia.https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/children-of- camelot/7/ They have one son, Matthew Maxwell Taylor Kennedy Jr. (born September 18, 1993), and two daughters, Caroline Summer Rose Kennedy (born December 29, 1994), and Noah Isabella Kennedy (born July 9, 1998 in Hyannis, Massachusetts). When Max and Edward Kennedy Jr. were children, grandmother Rose would tell them the story of how their uncle, President John F. Kennedy, saved a member of his PT boat crew in World War II by towing him to an island. Max visited the Solomon Islands in 2002 with Robert Ballard to revisit the scene of the story of John F. Kennedy's PT-109. He presented a bust of the late president to Biuku Gasa and Eroni Kumana, the native coastwatcher scouts who found the missing Kennedy and his crew.

Known colloquially as Ekspres and started in 1963 as an evening paper meant to compete with Veƒçernje novosti, it arrived on the market as the fourth Belgrade daily. After initial difficulties it eventually managed to build a sizable readership, so that by the early 1980s it achieved a daily circulation in excess of 200,000 copies. Ga≈°enje Ekspresa - Ni≈°ta od vaskrsenja With the disintegration of SFR Yugoslavia followed by wars, the UN trade embargo, and the resulting severe financial crisis that hit Serbia, Ekspres' circulation nosedived. In 1999, during NATO's bombardment of Serbia, the paper became the centerpiece of controversy due to a commentary published in the April 5, 1999 issue titled \\"ƒÜuruvija doƒçekao bombe\\" (ƒÜuruvija Greeted the Bombs) about a prominent journalist Slavko ƒÜuruvija. ƒÜuruvija was essentially accused of being happy about the fact that Serbia suffers daily NATO air raids. The piece was even referenced on RTS television's (Serbian state TV, also firmly under Milo≈°eviƒá's control at the time) central evening newscast Dnevnik 2 on April 4, the night before the issue went to news stands. When ƒÜuruvija got assassinated six days later on April 11, 1999, many pointed to the article and its mention in the newscast as part of groundwork for the murder, meant to dehumanize ƒÜuruvija and desensitize the public to the news of his impending death. Widely held view is that Milo≈°eviƒá's wife Mira Markoviƒá ordered both the article and ƒÜuruvija's subsequent murder. With its reputation severely tarnished, the paper continued after the October 2000 regime change, but its financial prospects looked very bleak. In 2004, one last attempt to resurrect it occurred after Politika AD and WAZ-Mediengruppe formed a 50-50 joint venture. Ekspres got a visual makeover, but it still couldn't keep up and eventually folded in early 2005.

The focus is on implementation level security issues and software security testing. History OUSPG has been active as an independent academic research group in the Computer Engineering Laboratory in the Department of Electrical and Information Engineering in the University of Oulu since summer 1996. OUSPG is most known for its participation in protocol implementation security testing, which they called robustness testing, using the PROTOS mini-simulation method. The PROTOS was co-operated project with VTT and number of industrial partners. The project developed different approaches of testing implementations of protocols using black-box (i.e. functional) testing methods. The goal was to support pro-active elimination of faults with information security implications, promote awareness in these issues and develop methods to support customer driven evaluation and acceptance testing of implementations. Improving the security robustness of products was attempted through supporting the development process. The most notable result of the PROTOS project was the result of the c06-snmp test suite, which discovered multiple vulnerabilities in SNMP. The work done in PROTOS is continued in PROTOS-GENOME, which applies automatic structure inference combined with domain specific reasoning capabilities to enable automated black-box program robustness testing tools without having prior knowledge of the protocol grammar. This work has resulted in a large number of vulnerabilities being found in archive file and antivirus products.

After patrols in the area between the Scottish Isles and the Irish Sea, Capel was anchored in Moelfre Bay, Anglesey to await \\"D-Day\\". She sailed on 5 May 1944 to join the massive anti-submarine screen patrolling the western end of the English Channel, in order to protect the Normandy Landings of 6 June 1944. Capel returned to Belfast on 18 June to rest. After the port of Cherbourg was captured and cleared the Capel and her Escort Group escorted convoys across the Channel, to and from Cherbourg with rest periods spent at Plymouth. In late 1944 the group shifted operations to the eastern end of the Channel, patrolling the convoy route to the newly liberated port of Antwerp. At 14.14 hours on 26 December 1944 Capel and the rest the Escort Group were patrolling east-northeast of Cherbourg when the sighted the group and fired three T5 torpedoes; one of which hit Capel and another . Affleck was towed to port, but declared a total loss, while Capel sank at position . The survivors were picked up by American MTBs and taken to Cherbourg. Her commander, Lieutenant B.G. Heslop, DSC, eight officers, and 67 men were lost.

Their sound is categorized as indie rock, folk rock, experimental rock, alternative rock, or just rock, blending lush, complex arrangements with sing-along choruses that bring to mind folk-inflected pop and well-written novellas. Pulling Up Floors, Pouring on (New) Paint, released in 2006, captures the gorgeous melodies and warm, organic maladies of front man Shawn Jones. The September 2008 release saw the band embark on its most extensive touring to date, which included CMJ Music Marathon, Pop Montreal and South by Southwest in Austin, Texas. The Lovely Sparrows premiered the music video directed and animated by Eric Power of Clear Productions for \\"Year of the Dog\\" off Bury the Cynic during the 2009 SXSW Music Festival in Austin, Texas. The video was honored as one of the 25 best music videos of the year 2008 by MusicForants.com. Bury the Cynics was on the best of list by Fensepost (#2 album in 2008), The Bomb Shelter (#11), the Austinist (#5), Side One: Track One v1 (#7) and Side One: Track One v2 (#1). The Lovely Sparrows band's \\"new record is now officially in progress\\" and targeting the record's release in 2010. History Formed in 2005 by singer- songwriter Shawn Jones, The Lovely Sparrows is the culmination of over a decade of slugging it out in the southwestern indie rock circuit. The earliest incarnation of the band, which can be heard on 2005's self-released Take Your Hats Off You Godless Bastards 7‚Ä≥, reveled in Pavement and Bob Pollard-style laconic fuzz pop. Their early bash and pop revelry, however, was to be short- lived after a romantic split between Jones and bandmate Meaghan Perry stripped away the band's fuzzy, upbeat pop leanings. Jones rebuilt the band, embarked on a brief, danger-prone West Coast solo tour, dealt with numerous house floods, and recorded the band's debut EP in the wake of that breakup. Friends as well as former, current and occasional members of the band contributed their talents to flesh out Pulling up Floors, Pouring on (New) Paint, which was released to small-scale acclaim on upstart label Abandoned Love Records. The EP received positive reviews from the likes of Pitchfork, Spin, Paste, and Harp, as well as a host of bloggers and radio stations such as KUT, KVRX, KEXP, and KSZU. The band showcased at SXSW Music Festival then embarked on a few short tours of the East Coast and Midwest, recording a Daytrotter session and picking up discerning fans along the way.

The Tiny Tim was a rocket power adaption of a 500lb bomb - each aircraft carrying a single rocket. The plan was disapproved.

The character is played by Melissa Walton and first appeared on-screen on 26 November 2008 during the first series of the Hollyoaks spin-off Hollyoaks Later as a new love interest for the character Dominic Reilly (John Pickard). She made her first appearance in the Hollyoaks series in February 2009 and was the first character to be introduced to the series by producer Lucy Allan. In 2010 Loretta was axed from the series, along with 15 other characters, during a cast cull by executive producer Paul Marquess. The character development has Loretta having worked as a pole dancer and Walton put extensive research into the role, including visiting strip clubs. Despite this occupation Loretta has been portrayed out of conjunction with the blonde stereotype. She has been involved in storylines which include facing prejudice, body scarring issues and stalking fellow characters. The character is most noted for the series intending to portray her as a child murderer trying to piece her life back together. The plot was subsequently axed having caused a great amount of controversy among the British public after newspapers alleged that the storyline was copying a real- life case. Loretta has been positively received by the media for her appearance and has been dubbed a \\"blond bombshell\\". Before Loretta's departure from the series Marquess made changes to the characters persona: portraying her as a stalker being obsessive, calculating and pretending to have leukaemia. In her final storyline it was revealed that she had been sexually abused as a child and admitted herself to a psychiatric hospital. Character creation and casting The character of Loretta was created as a temporary love interest for Dominic Reilly (John Pickard) and was intended to feature only in Hollyoaks Later, the spin-off from the Hollyoaks series. In 2009 it was announced that the Hollyoaks' producer Lucy Allan had decided to introduce both Loretta and Cheryl Brady (Bronagh Waugh) into the main show. Allan said, \\"Cheryl and Loretta will bring an energy and a sense of fun to the show. Both Melissa and Bronagh impressed me with their performances in Hollyoaks Later and I'm sure viewers will warm to them quickly.\\" Loretta was initially paired with Dom and, after ending their relationship, was given links to other characters in the series. Walton had a pole set up in her living room to practice pole dancing. Speaking of her research Walton stated: \\"I loved it. It's really good exercise. It's really good for toning. They didn't ask me to, but I did... I went and I had pole dancing classes. I had a pole put up in my living room.\\" Though Walton had initially signed on for a three-month stint Allan decided to renew her contract in 2009 and keep Loretta in the series until 2010. In early 2010 it was announced that Allan had stepped down from the position of executive producer and that Paul Marquess had taken over the role. It was soon revealed that Marquess planned to give Hollyoaks a \\"shake up\\", changing the productions team and beginning a cast cull by axing three established characters. Stephanie Waring (who plays Cindy Hutchinson) then revealed that all remaining cast members feared their own character would be axed. One month later Marquess announced his plans to axe a further 11 characters, including Loretta at the end of Walton's contract. It was also revealed that Loretta would depart at the same time as her current love interest Jake Dean (Kevin Sacre). On 8 June 2010 Walton filmed her final scenes for the series, along with two fellow cast members Scare and Gerard McCarthy (who plays Kris Fisher). She spoke of her upset over leaving her fellow cast members, but later said she was looking forward to pursuing other projects. Walton also confirmed that she was happy the door was left open for a potential return, stating that she would consider reprising her role as Loretta in the future. Walton also said she understood why Marquess axed her character, he did not feel Loretta had anywhere left to go after the cancellation of her main storyline. However, she also felt like she deserved another chance to prove herself. Character development and impact=Characterisation= Loretta has stated on-screen that she does not want to conform with the stereotype of a blond pole dancer, and makes it clear that she is a keen bird watcher and enjoys documentaries. Speaking of the character Walton stated, \\"I love that Loretta's not a stereotypical stripper sort of girl‚Äîthere‚Äôs a lot more depth to her. She‚Äôs actually quite shy and reserved. She‚Äôs got lots of interesting little hobbies, like bird-watching and Roman history! Then at night she skips off and turns into a stripper. It‚Äôs like two different lives, and I think many real-life pole-dancers are like that. They‚Äôre really nice, normal girls by day, and by night they turn into these temptresses.\\" Walton also praised the soap's realistic portrayal of the occupation, saying that many pole dancers attend university or have good professions but rely on stripping for extra money, and that she has met people like her character in the strip club where Hollyoaks films scenes. Walton hopes viewers will find Loretta's alter ego as a stripper tasteful commenting, \\"As tasteful as you can be in a pink frilly bra and knicker set, with a little skirt that‚Äôs more like a belt, and back-combed hair and fake eyelashes!\\" Loretta's stripper clothing is in stark contrast to her every day look of non- revealing clothing. Loretta's relationships helped develop the character. Her first relationship is with Dom Reilly who shares her interests in bird watching, documentaries on ancient Rome and literature. The relationship immediately gave viewers an insight into the character. However, as their relationship progressed, it became apparent that Dom could not handle Loretta's profession as he feared for her safety, which ultimately lead to their break up. Loretta's second relationship is a short-lived fling with Ravi Roy (Stephen Uppal) where she is determined to see the good in him, and help him while he suffers from a brain aneurysm, but ends the relationship when he attempts to assault her. Loretta then begins a secret romance with Jake, who had tried to murder his child and rape his wife. Loretta believes he had been misled and is still a good person, demonstrating Loretta's willingness to give people second chances. Walton comments, \\"[Loretta] is just lovely ‚Äì she sees the good in everyone.\\" When television listings magazine What's on TV challenged Walton to explain why Loretta would be interested in Jake after his crimes Walton said, \\"Loretta's big on forgiveness. She believes Jake‚Äôs changed, that he's learnt from his time inside and he's paid his debt to society.\\" Melissa Walton (pictured) said Loretta pole dances to gain power over men. After Marquess decided to axe Loretta he changed the character's direction and her persona. She became obsessive over men, controlling towards Jake, manipulative and began lying to get what she wanted. Jake later decides he does not want her, of this Walton states that: \\"She's not going anywhere. She's deluded and manipulative and he hasn't seen anything yet!\\" She also is shown have \\"bunny boiler\\" tendencies, with Walton agreeing to the label. Walton later revealed that Loretta began pole dancing to have power over men because of the abuse she suffered as a child although, as Loretta's exit approached, she was now a dangerous and deluded woman. =Child murderer controversy= In November 2009 Loretta became the centre of media controversy when various media outlets announced that Loretta would be part of a storyline which revealed that she had murdered a child in her past. The controversy began when tabloid newspaper The mother of murdered toddler James Bulger, Denise Fergus, condemned the storyline. While speaking to the news website Click Liverpool she criticised the decision to air a plot that allegedly mirrored her son's death, stating they should have consulted her first. She said, \\"I'm shocked and disgusted at what Hollyoaks is doing. They have clearly based this story on what happened to James and it's outrageous that they should do this without consulting with me in any way.\\" She threatened to encourage a boycott of the show. Channel 4 released a statement defending the plot, explaining it had nothing to do with any real life case: \\"The forthcoming storyline is not based on any real-life case and it will in no way seek to recreate real events. The storyline focuses on the psychological repercussions for two characters in the show who were responsible for the death of a 12-year-old girl in the past.\\" Speaking about delving into her character's history Walton commented to entertainment website Digital Spy, \\"It took a little while and until now, we've known little about her. Nobody in the village knows who she is or where she's come from. She's just planted herself in the village knowing hardly anybody. She's quite a mysterious character. I'm absolutely loving the opportunity to explore her backstory.\\" Speaking about her reaction to the plot she continued, \\"I was like, 'Oh my gosh!' I was so shocked but absolutely chuffed to bits because this is what all actors want ‚Äì something massive like this to sink my teeth into. I feel so privileged that they've trusted me with this story. I know they've wanted to do it for a while and they've finally chosen me!\\" In the same interview Walton described the storyline, \\"Loretta and Chrissy were best, best friends through childhood. They were closer than sisters. She somehow tracks Loretta down and turns up out of the blue after Loretta's finished a dance class. What we learn is that when they were 12, they bullied a young girl and didn't stop until they killed her. They kept pushing and pushing and eventually killed her. Since then, Loretta and Chrissy have been completely separated from each other, their families and friends. They've spent years in institutions having psychiatric and behavioural treatment.\\" Chrissy reminds Loretta of her secret past in scenes cut from transmitted episodes. (2009) Kevin Sacre, whose character was directly involved in the storyline, voiced his support for the plot stating: \\"I think the fact that it's the sort of thing that happens in real life means it's something that should be addressed. Anyone who buries their head in the sand is a bit na√Øve. And I think soap is a medium where you can explore issues of real life.\\" Just days before the episodes were set to transmit Channel 4 announced that it was axing the storyline, due in part to Fergus's reaction to the storyline. Whilst Walton had previously claimed the storyline was about three twelve-year-old girls, Channel 4 admitted the similarities between the story and the Bulger case. \\"This particular storyline was not based on any real life case and was not intended to recreate actual events. However, after conversations with Denise Fergus we have agreed to amend certain aspects of the storyline.\\" Amber Hodgkiss, who was cast to play Chrissy, expressed her disappointment over the decision to axe the plot all together saying, \\"The storyline has been completely cut. I am not so happy about it. I would like it to go ahead, but I don't have that decision. It wasn't based on Jamie Bulger, but people portrayed it that way. It was quite a big storyline that could affect people, but it happens.\\" Fergus said she was grateful that the plot was axed saying, \\"I'm grateful that they are respecting my wishes. I made it clear that I did not want those scenes broadcast and I'm pleased to say they clearly understood my feelings.\\" When episodes that were intended to feature the storyline transmitted, they instead featured a selection of then \\"last minute\\" scenes. In these scenes Hodgkiss portrays a new character, Caroline, who holds Loretta and Jake hostage. =Stalker and exit storyline= Walton's exit from the series was described as dramatic, with Walton commenting on this during an interview with magazine programme Live from Studio Five stating, \\"I'm very pleased with my exit, you know. I'm very, very pleased with what I've been given and I've really enjoyed doing it. I've probably enjoyed the last few months of filming more than I've enjoyed anything else that I've done, to be honest.\\" Loretta's backstory gradually began to unfold on-screen. Loretta decided she needed to win Jake back. Her ex-boyfriend Adam (Vlach Ashton) warned Jake that Loretta had previously stalked him. This starts to damage their relationship and during an interview with What's on TV Walton commented on it saying that Jake was suspicious of Loretta's motives. Loretta love for Jake turned into an obsession with Walton saying, \\"She's definitely not giving up on him. What he thought was love is already actually an obsession. She wants to totally control him\\". The story line reveals her past of obsessions with men and Walton stated, \\"You sense Adam wasn't the only ex-partner she stalked. She has a mobile full of men's numbers.\\" Walton explains the cause of her behaviour, \\"You find out much later on that it's because of something that happened in her past. Her obsession really is getting full-on [...] She's jealous of anybody who gets Jake's attention.\\" After Jake's sister Steph Cunningham (Carley Stenson) is diagnosed with cervical cancer Loretta pretends she once had leukaemia in order to trap Jake. He throws her out though because his son had previously suffered from the illness. Loretta refuses to give up and her behaviour becomes more erratic. In the final episodes of her departure Loretta manages to convince everyone that Jake was mentally ill once more. She takes Nancy Hayton (Jessica Fox) hostage for snooping into her life with Adam and Walton states, \\"Loretta is dangerous and deluded, Nancy's terrified of her ‚Äì she tries to escape but Loretta won't let her She accidentally pushes Nancy, who crashes into a table and bangs her head badly\\". Walton also revealed more of Loretta's past saying, \\"Adam confesses that Loretta was violent towards him, basically she did some awful things to him that she's doing to Jake now.\\" The storyline sought to explain all the unanswered questions left in her backstory with Walton saying, \\"He [Jake] tries to talk her round, and at that point she reveals she was sexually abused when she was very young. It's supposedly the reason she went into stripping to have power over men.\\" Walton also defended Loretta's final actions, saying the character was confused and did not mean to hurt anyone. In Loretta's final scene she voluntarily admits herself into a psychiatric hospital after being convinced to by Jake. Storylines Loretta first appears as a stripper who works in a lap-dancing club. During her job Loretta meets Dom. The pair like each other but she decides not to go out with him, she feels he is not yet over the death of his wife Tina (Leah Hackett). Loretta is not seen again until February 2009, when she and Dom begin a relationship. Loretta clashes with Mercedes Fisher (Jennifer Metcalfe) who is not happy to find out that Dom has moved on from Tina. Loretta moves in with Cindy Cunningham (Stephanie Waring) and Darren Osborne (Ashley Taylor Dawson). Loretta lies to Dom saying she has quit her job and does not tell him the truth until Darren finds out and begins to blackmail her. Loretta then quits her job for Dom, but later finds a new job as a stripper at a different club. Dom worries about Loretta's safety at her job and gives her a rape alarm, much to her amusement. Loretta reassures him, but realises how serious it is for him when he reveals that Tina's abduction and death has left him uptight about safety. They then end their relationship. Loretta drunkenly teaches Nancy Hayton, Zoe Carpenter (Zo√´ Lister), Hannah Ashworth (Emma Rigby) and Sarah Barnes (Loui Batley) how to dance in the Student Union bar. She slips and falls onto some glass bottles which break and cut her stomach. Loretta is horrified when she is left scarred by the glass. Her boss sacks her, because her scars have rendered her unattractive, and Loretta is given a job in Tan & Tumble by Ash Roy (Junade Khan). Loretta develops a crush on Ravi Roy which makes his brother Ash jealous. After Loretta catches Ravi being violent towards his sister Leila (Lena Kaur) she distances herself from him and Ash starts flirting with her. Ash kisses Loretta and Ravi sees it and lashes out at. This leads an angry Ravi to fight in an illegal boxing match. After Ravi taunts Ash he punches Ravi, who was diagnosed with an aneurysm, and Ravi falls into a coma. Loretta explains to Kris Fisher (Gerard McCarthy) and Anita Roy (Saira Choudhry) that Ash tried to kiss her, which Kris believes and Ash tries to deny. Loretta gradually becomes good friends with Nancy and Hannah. When Nancy's abusive ex-husband Jake Dean, who tried to rape her and kill his and his ex-wife Becca's son Charlie (Joshua McConville), returns to the village Loretta consoles Nancy and moves in with her. Loretta grows close to Jake and, although initially hesitant, forms a relationship with him. After Jake and Loretta go public, Loretta is kicked out by Nancy and moves in with Jake. When Jake's sister Steph Cunningham (Carley Stenson) suggests the pair are moving too quickly Loretta agrees, she talks to Jake who gets angry showing his temper to Loretta for the first time. The couple reconcile with the help of Steph. Loretta strikes up a friendship with Holly Hutchinson (Lydia Waters) who aspires to be a dancer like Loretta after feeling unnoticed by her mother Cindy. As they bond Loretta gives Holly advice on dancing. Loretta faces prejudice when she starts applying for new jobs, as no one will employ her due to her previous jobs as a stripper. She later lies during an interview, her interviewers discover her previous employment and make derogatory remarks to her. Holly runs away from home and a large-scale police investigation is put in place to find her. Many other residents in the village suspect Loretta's boyfriend Jake of being her kidnapper, unaware that she is safe and hiding in Darren's flat. Loretta leaves Jake after she begins to doubt his innocence but later reconciles with him. After Jake finds Holly he chases her, she falls over and takes a blow to the head and falls into a coma. Initially the police suspect that Jake was behind this but later release him. Loretta once more begins to doubt him. Upset, Jake goes to stay with his old friend Caroline (Amber Hodgkiss). After sleeping with him Caroline drugs him, ties him up, tries to kill him, and holds him hostage for a few days. She is angered to learn he is going out with Loretta and sets out to try to kill Holly but Loretta is there by Holly's bedside. Caroline tries to attack Loretta with a syringe needle but Jake saves Loretta and, in the process, Caroline is stabbed with the needle. After the ordeal Loretta disappears, having to accept the fact that Jake had cheated on her much to his dismay. She returns but while she was away Loretta had become involved with a realtor called Adam. At first Jake thought she was looking for a home. However, when he saw them both arguing, Jake realises something was not as it seemed. When Jake confronts Loretta she tells him that Adam was harassing her. This leads to Jake confronting Adam and warning him to stay away from Loretta. However Adam tells him that Loretta had been controlling his life and that she wants to be with him. Adam explains that Loretta had told him about Jake and that he was the biggest mistake of her life in the hope that Adam would take her back. Later she goes on a night out to The Loft nightclub and threatens Charlotte Lau (Amy Yamazaki). She says that she will kill Lau if she ever goes near Jake again, making viewers realise that Loretta had changed her personality and her behaviour since her absence. Loretta pretends she had Leukaemia but Jake finds out the truth and ends their relationship. She later convinces Steph that Jake lied when he told Steph that Loretta had said she was ill and she makes Frankie and Steph believe Jake is losing his mind again.

She debuted on-screen during the episode airing on 9 June 2009 and was introduced by series producer Lucy Allan as the ex-girlfriend of Lydia Hart (Lydia Kelly). In September 2010, it was announced that Yamazaki and Charlotte had departed Hollyoaks and her final scenes had already aired, with Charlotte making her final appearance on 17 September 2010. Character creation and casting In May 2009, in an interview with entertainment website Digital Spy, Hollyoaks series producer Lucy Allan announced that a number of students at Hollyoaks Community College would be moving out of Halls of Residence in preparation for the new term. Former BBC Three Coming of Age actress Amy Yamazaki joined the cast as Charlotte Lau, the new barmaid at the SU Bar and ex-girlfriend of established character Lydia Hart (Lydia Kelly). She made her first on-screen appearance on 9 June 2009. In July 2009, it was announced by the media that Charlotte would become one of the new of students. Charlotte was noted for being the second homosexual female character to be introduced in 2009. In September 2010, Yamazaki was unexpectedly written out of the show. After her departure, the Hollyoaks official website confirmed her final scenes had already aired. Fans of Charlotte became angry with executive producer Paul Marquess because they thought he had axed her. In reality Yamazaki had quit to concentrate on her writing. Whilst interviewed by entertainment website Digital Spy Marquess stated: \\"I just want to put the record straight that Amy who played Charlotte wanted to go, because I think a lot of people were really angry with me for 'axing' Charlotte ‚Äì which I didn't! She wanted to go off and write, so that's why she fell off an arch!\\" Characterisation Charlotte's personality has been evident from inception. She has an alternative dress code, with Channel 4 publicity stating that she is a 'Tokyo grunger'. She is also described as super friendly, funny and cool and knows how to hold her own. With script writers referencing on-screen that she may be unhinged. After the character had appeared on-screen for a brief period of time her style was described as 'funky and feisty' and has been applied a trend of bold clothing to create a 'Tokyo pop' look. Charlotte is also very open about her sexuality and makes reference to it on-screen on a number of occasions. In October 2009, Amy Yamazaki, whilst talking about the character's sexuality, stated in an interview with PA: \\"As far as I'm concerned, acting is just acting whether you're kissing a boy or a girl. Chances are you're not going to fancy them ‚Äì they're just people you work with. I don't want to come across as someone who'll kiss anybody but when it comes to an acting job, I don't have an opinion if my character fancies a person whether it be boy, girl or, I don't know, mushroom.\\" Storylines Charlotte first appears on 9 June 2009, as a barmaid in the SU Bar and the ex-girlfriend of Lydia Hart (Lydia Kelly). Archie Carpenter (Stephen Beard) immediately starts flirting with Charlotte and is annoyed to find out she is a lesbian, realising many girls in the village are lesbians or have had lesbian encounters. Ravi Roy (Stephen Uppal) is embarrassed when Charlotte tells him she is a lesbian after he flirts with her. On 24 July, Charlotte begins to get closer to Lydia. The pair see Lydia's girlfriend Sarah Barnes (Loui Batley) kissing Rhys Ashworth (Andrew Moss) and assume something is going on, however they are unaware she did it to get music tickets for her and Lydia. After Lydia finds this out, she apologises and the pair kiss. Charlotte watches as they kiss and appears upset. Charlotte teases Nancy Hayton (Jessica Fox) about her sexuality, and is convinced she is a lesbian, although Nancy repeatedly disputes this. When Sarah splits up with Lydia, Charlotte offers her a shoulder to cry on. This later leads to Lydia trying to kiss Charlotte but she retaliates. Lydia storms off after Sarah sees them both and blames everything on Charlotte. Charlotte later becomes a Psychology student at Hollyoaks Community College and moves into the halls. She then mistakenly thinks India Longford (Beth Kingston) is a lesbian and offends her. On what would have been Lydia and Charlotte's anniversary, Lydia is given a bouquet of dead flowers. Sarah and Zoe Carpenter (Zo√´ Lister) blame this on Charlotte, claiming she is trying to split them up. Charlotte then accuses Zoe of attempting to break up the relationship. Lydia takes Charlotte's side, creating a divide in her relationship with Sarah. Sarah later dies during skydiving unbeknown to Charlotte the parachute was tampered by Lydia but Zoe is wrongfully arrested this leads to a feud between Charlotte and Zoe's brother Archie who is desperate to defend his sister. Charlotte and Lydia get back together, but agree to keep quiet. During Zoe's trial, Charlotte attends. When the knife Zoe apparently used to cut the parachute is shown to the court, Charlotte recognises it, as she gave Lydia it before the camping trip. Charlotte confronts Lydia, who immediately admits to using the knife, but in an attempt to commit suicide. After Charlotte pleads with her to tell the police, Lydia tells her if she goes to prison, she will kill herself. Despite this, Zoe is found not guilty of Sarah's murder. However, she befriends Lydia to gain a confession. When Charlotte discovers Zoe's plans, she admits to Mike and Dave Colburn (Elliot James Langridge) about Lydia's murder of Sarah. Charlotte rushes to the local cemetery, where Lydia and Zoe are, with Dave and Mike close behind. When she gets there, Lydia stabs Zoe at Sarah's grave. Charlotte pleads with Lydia, who threatens her. As they realise Zoe is still alive, Lydia tries to get the knife. However, Charlotte attacks her and Dave gets the knife. New fresher Jamil Fadel (Sikander Malik) tries it on with Charlotte, unaware she is a lesbian. Charlotte takes drugs, given to her by Doug Carter (PJ Brennan) in Chez Chez. She dances with Jamil, who is convinced that he can win her over. Charlotte leaves the nightclub and suggests going into town with India and Jamil, who are unaware she had taken drugs. Charlotte climbs on top of the village wall arch and asks them to join her. Doug watches her and Jamil on the arch and rushes to stop them. However, Charlotte loses her balance and falls off. Charlotte is taken to hospital, where she regains consciousness. Doug is made to leave after Charlotte tells everyone he gave her the drugs. Charlotte fears she will be paralysed and decides to leave Hollyoaks.

It is one of the oldest public buildings in the Baltic states. The building is currently used as the Latvian National Symphony Orchestra concert hall.  History  View of the Large Guild from a 1918 vintage picture postcard Large Guild today Large Guild was Riga merchant organization. Its roots begin with Holy Spirit guild in the 13th century as Riga's first new established brotherhood. The Guild accepted traders and craftsmen, except for weavers and sauna operators. Later the Holy Spirit guild was split in two parts. According to historical sources, the two parts were named for the two rooms: the Minster and Zoste Rooms. The two room names were brought from Germany by German traders. Later on, the two guild organizations were split by economic and social interests: the Large Guild brought together German traders and the Small Guild brought together German craftsmen. In 1353, in the Minster Room, traders were recognized by statute, and that it is treated as the year of Large Guild establishment. The current look of the Large Guild was made by architects Karl Beine and Heinrich Shelle between 1853 and 1859. Large Guild was rebuilt in the Tudor gothic style. The concert hall in the Guild was made after 1963 because of a fire. In 1965. the Guild was reconstructed by architect Modris Gelz and the interior was customized for concert hall needs. The Large Guild currently houses the Latvian National Symphony Orchestra. Its rooms are also suitable for a wide range of cultural events and conferences. = Interior = The most known Large Guild rooms are the minster room and bride's chamber. The minster room is famous because it is the only room in Latvia who is preserved from the Middle Ages as a secular society building indoor room. The bride's chamber was meant as a Guild gathering place and also was meant for wedding needs. In 1888 there was made stained glass in the Large guilds staircase (master A. Frieshtatle), expressing the greatness of united German merchants. Stained glass depicts the events of 1353, when the master of the Order of the city handed over Large guilds building to the representatives of the guild. Modern day stained glass depicts most important business areas of Riga. In 1936, stained glass was made by Ansis Cƒ´rulis.

Because it crossed the International Date Line it began in local time on November 14 west of the date line over northern Australia, and ended in local time on November 13 east of the date line near the west coast of South America. Its greatest magnitude was 1.0500, occurring only 12 hours before perigee (Perigee on 2012 Nov 14 at 10:11:48 UTC), with greatest eclipse totality lasting just over four minutes. A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. A total solar eclipse occurs when the Moon's apparent diameter is larger than the Sun's, blocking all direct sunlight, turning day into darkness. Totality occurs in a narrow path across Earth's surface, with the partial solar eclipse visible over a surrounding region thousands of kilometres wide. It was the 45th eclipse of the 133rd Saros cycle, which began with a partial eclipse on July 13, 1219 and will conclude with a partial eclipse on September 5, 2499.

The most populous city to experience totality was Cairns, which had 2 minutes of totality an hour after daybreak (06:39 AEST, 20:39 UTC) with the sun at an altitude of 14¬∞. Norfolk Island, a small Pacific island east of Australia, experienced a partial eclipse with a maximum of 98% of the sun obscured at 08:37 NFT and an altitude of 42¬∞. New Zealand experienced a partial eclipse. Auckland had 87.1% of the sun obscured, whereas Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin respectively had 76.3%, 68.8% and 61.5% of the sun obscured. Maximum eclipse over New Zealand occurred around 10:30 NZDT (21:30 UTC), with Auckland at 10:27, Wellington at 10:34, Christchurch at 10:35 and Dunedin at 10:36.Total Solar Eclipse of 2012 November 14 in Australia Xavier M. Jubier Most of Chile and parts of Argentina saw a partial eclipse at sunset. In some places over half the sun was obscured. In Chile, Valdivia in Los R√≠os saw 63% obscured, Quell√≥n in Los Lagos saw 54% obscured. Chilean coastal locations were ideally situated to observe an eclipsing sunset over the Pacific Ocean. Points further north, up to about La Serena, saw the eclipse begin as the sun was setting. West of the International Date Line the eclipse took place on the morning of November 14. The maximum eclipse totality, of duration 4 min 2 sec, occurred east of the International Date Line on November 13, approximately 2000 km east of New Zealand, and 9600 km west of Chile. On the morning of November 14, skies in Auckland were cloudy, obscuring much of the eclipse, which peaked at 10:27 NZDT. Cloud also obscured the moment of totality at Cairns, disappointing many tourists that had flocked to the area. Eclipse chasers along the northern beaches up through to Port Douglas generally got a clear view however.

The Macmillan Committee was formed in 1929 by Royal Command 3897, and it was tasked with determining whether the contemporary banking and financial system was helping or hindering British trade and industry. Scottish lawyer Hugh Pattison Macmillan was named as its chairman, although due to his lack of economic or financial expertise, he largely \\"remained in the background\\".Donald Edward Moggridge, Maynard Keynes: An Economist's Biography, p. 510, Routledge, 1992, . Other members of the committee included Ernest Bevin, Lord Bradbury, R. H. Brand, Theodore Gregory, John Maynard Keynes, and Reginald McKenna.Charles Loch Mowat, Britain Between the Wars: 1918-1940, pp. 260‚Äì261, Taylor & Francis, 1978, . The committee took evidence from many leading economists of the day, such as Arthur Cecil Pigou, D. H. Robertson and Lionel Robbins, on the subject of unemployment. It decided in favour of the so-called Treasury view that expenditure on public works was not the answer, in spite of the signing of Addendum 1 by some of its leading members. This addendum, which was signed by Keynes, A.A.G. Tullock, J. Frater Taylor, Sir T. Allen, Ernest Bevin and R. McKenna, advocated a programme of public works and import restrictions. However the committee insisted that monetary policy should be concerned with 'the maintenance of the parity of the foreign exchanges before the avoidance of the credit cycle and the stability of the price level.' The Penguin Dictionary of Economics George Bannock, R. E. Baxter and Evan Davis. 5th Edition. Penguin Books 1992. The committee published its findings and recommendations in the Report of Committee on Finance and Industry, or more simply, the Macmillan Report, in 1931.Friedrich A. von Hayek, The Road to Serfdom, pp. 66‚Äì67, University of Chicago Press, 1944. The Macmillan Report \\"served as a venue in which J. M. Keynes challenged the 'Treasury View'\\", according to economist Friedrich von Hayek. The report was largely authored by Keynes, and it recommended several Keynesian policies such as nationalization of the Bank of England and government regulation of international trade.Philip Williamson, National Crisis and National Government, pp. 255‚Äì258, Cambridge University Press, 2003, . Historian Charles Loch Mowat characterized these recommendations as \\"cautious\\" and said that, by the time of its publication, they \\"had been almost overtaken by events\\". Its members disagreed on some points and one member dissented on its findings. These opinions and reservations were included in the report's extensive addenda.J. C. Stamp, The Report of the Macmillan Committee, The Economic Journal, pp. 424‚Äì435, Vol. 41, No. 163, September 1931. The report also asserted that \\"the relations between the British financial world and British industry ... have never been so close as\\" those respective relationships in Germany and those in the United States. From this conclusion arose the term the \\"Macmillan Gap\\".Chris Wrigley, A Companion to Early Twentieth-Century Britain, pp. 250-251, Wiley-Blackwell, 2003, . As such, many Britons felt that their banks were failing their industrial base. This view did not consider the balance that banking institutions needed to strike between their depositors, who desired high interest rates and liquidity, and their debtors, that is, those in industry, who desired low-interest loans that could not be recalled quickly. Investments of relatively small amounts of money were riskier and more costly for lenders, which put small businesses seeking loans at a disadvantage.W. A. Thomas, The Finance of British Industry 1918‚Äì1976, pp. 117‚Äì118, Taylor & Francis, 2006, . While the report dedicated only 300 words to such a disparity, the term Macmillan Gap is the most enduring part of the report. It was also one of the few recommendations which were acted upon. In response to the committee's suggestion, an institution was created to finance small businesses:Raymond Frost, The Macmillan Gap 1931-53, Oxford Economic Papers, Oxford University Press, p. 1. the Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation.M. M. Postan, An Economic History of Western Europe: 1945-1964, p. 122, Taylor & Francis, 2006, . The maintenance of the exchange rate was agreed to be the first priority by all, including the signatories of Addendum 1. Two months after the report was published the UK came off the Gold Standard and the exchange rate depreciated immediately by 2% and continued downwards for 12 months.

On 30 September 2009, Hyperion and Amiga, Inc. reached a settlement agreement where Hyperion was granted an exclusive, perpetual and worldwide right to distribute and use 'The Software', a term used during the dispute and subsequent settlement to refer to source code from AmigaOS 3 and earlier, and ownership of AmigaOS 4.x and beyond. Background=Amiga, Inc.= After Commodore filed for bankruptcy in 1994, its name and IP rights, including Amiga, were sold to Escom. Escom kept the Amiga products and sold the Commodore name on to Tulip Computers. Escom went bankrupt in 1997 and sold the Amiga IP to Gateway 2000 (now only Gateway). On 27 December 1999, Gateway sold the Amiga name and rights to Amino Development, who changed the company name to Amiga, Inc. once the assets had been acquired. The 'Amino' Amiga, Inc. and the 'KMOS' Amiga, Inc. are seen by Hyperion as legally distinct entities, contracts to one are of no relevance to the other. =Hyperion's OS4 project= Hyperion Entertainment has released AmigaOS 4 (OS4) to the public in 2004. The five year development process led to accusations of vapourware and producing a modern PowerPC OS, given that Hyperion claimed that they had the original AmigaOS 3.1 source code to reference (a claim later proven accurate). This was made worse by the apparent much more rapid progress and maturity of competitor and alternative AmigaOS clone MorphOS, which had been begun several years earlier. Perhaps the most important feature of OS4 as regards the legal dispute is the presence of an entirely new PowerPC native kernel. ExecSG replaces the original Amiga Exec and is claimed entirely the work and property of Hyperion's subcontracted developers Thomas and Hans-Joerg Frieden. Neither Amiga, Inc. nor Hyperion actually own ExecSG, so technically cannot demand or hand it over, leaving the OS with fragmented and confused ownership. The supposed rebirth of Amiga AmigaOne X1000 running AmigaOS 4.1 In 2007 The Inquirer reported that the Amiga was inching closer to rebirth with the long-awaited release of AmigaOS 4.0, a new PowerPC-native version of the classic AmigaOS (Motorola 68k) from the 1980s. This new PowerPC OS would run on the AmigaOne machines, now out of production, which could only run Linux while waiting for the new PowerPC OS to be released. The year after, Amiga, Inc. also announced a new AmigaOS 4 compatible system that would be available shortly. The new machine was neither Genesi's Efika, nor the project codenamed Samantha, (now known as the Sam440ep from ACube Systems). The new hardware was from a new entrant, the Canadian company ACK Software Controls, and would have consisted of a budget and advanced model. The dispute Four days after Amiga, Inc. announced the new Amiga OS4 (OS4) compatible machines, they sued Hyperion Entertainment (Hyperion). Amiga, Inc. stated that it decided to produce a PowerPC version of AmigaOS in 2001 and on November 3, 2001, they signed a contract with Hyperion (then a game developer for the 68k Amiga platform as well as Linux and Macintosh). Amiga, Inc. gave Hyperion access to the sources of the last Commodore version, AmigaOS 3.1, but access to the post-Commodore versions OS 3.5 and 3.9 had to be purchased from the third party responsible for their development, since Haage & Partner (developers of OS 3.5 and 3.9) never returned their AmigaOS source code to Amiga, Inc. Amiga, Inc. also said that its contract allowed Hyperion to use Amiga trademarks in the promotion of OS4 on Eyetech's AmigaOne and stipulated that Hyperion should make its best efforts to deliver OS 4 by March 1, 2002, a port of an elderly operating system (68k) for an entirely different processor architecture (PowerPC) in four months, an optimistic target that Hyperion failed to meet. According to Amiga, Inc., the contract permits the purchase of the full sources of OS4 from Hyperion for US$25,000. The court filing says that Amiga, Inc. paid this sometime in April‚ÄìMay 2003, to keep Hyperion from going bankrupt, and that between then and November 21, 2006, Amiga, Inc. paid another $7,200, then $8,850 more which it says Hyperion said was owing. Furthermore, in the filing, Amiga, Inc. President Bill McEwen revealed that Amiga, Inc. still hasn't received the sources for AmigaOS 4, that he's discovered that much of its development was outsourced to third-party contract developers and that it is not clear if Hyperion has all the rights to this external work. Eventually, after five years and $41,050, on 21 November 2006, Amiga, Inc. told Hyperion it had violated the contract and gave it 30 days to sort it out‚Äîto finish the product and hand over the sources. That did not happen, so the contract was terminated. on 20 December 2006. Hyperion claims in its defense that Amiga, Inc. rendered the contract null through dealings with KMOS, a company which acquired the Amiga assets and renamed itself Amiga, Inc. over 2004‚Äì05. Four days later, on 24 December 2006, Hyperion released the final version of OS4 ‚Äì although according to Amiga, Inc., Hyperion claims that this was merely an update of the developers' preview version of 16 April 2004. Since the contract ended, Hyperion had no rights to use the name AmigaOS or any Amiga intellectual property, or to market OS4 or enter into any agreements about it with anyone else. Nevertheless, AmigaOS 4 was still being developed and distributed. Furthermore, ACube Systems released a series of Sam440ep motherboards, which run AmigaOS 4\\\\. For a time, the case seemed deadlocked with neither side being apparently able to prove the point either way. Without Amiga, Inc.'s permission, Hyperion Entertainment could not use the AmigaOS name or related trademarks. Hyperion's defense centered around the potentially contract-voiding nature of the Amiga, Inc./KMOS handover, the problems they faced in acquiring the post-Commodore OS 3.x source code which Amiga, Inc. claimed to own and have access to, and the presence of new work and open components in the new operating system. Hyperion Entertainment and Amiga, Inc. reached settlement agreement On 30 September 2009, Hyperion Entertainment and Amiga, Inc. reached settlement agreement where Hyperion was granted, \\"an exclusive, perpetual, worldwide right to AmigaOS 3.1 in order to use, develop, modify, commercialize, distribute and market AmigaOS 4.x.

Owned by the NIP Info Orfej publishing company whose general manager Milorad Antoniƒá previously made a profit on the Belgrade-based Ekskluziv magazine and Bijeljina-based Ekstra magazin, Nacional's first issue appeared on 4 December 2001. Published in the ambitious initial circulation of 60,000 copies, the paper managed to establish itself fairly quickly on the market. With its semi-tabloid content format, the paper's chief editor was Predrag Popoviƒá while Dragan J. Vuƒçiƒáeviƒá was his deputy. Svetomir Marjanoviƒá, another prominent journalist on the Serbian daily tabloid scene was a feature editor. Nacional was published under the mantra 'Dnevni list Srbije' (Serbia's daily).

The two were ostensibly caught by Nacional reporters at Hotel Jugopetrol on Mount Zlatibor as the tabloid ran salacious details of the adulterous relationship for days.Mar≈°i se razveo!;Kurir, 23 January 2005 The story appeared against the backdrop of continuous in-fighting among the member parties of the ruling DOS coalition in the wake of an attempt to have Mar≈°iƒáanin removed from the parliamentary speaker position for supposedly breaking procedural rules. The timing of the story's release thus raised suspicion of being politically motivated. Nacional editor-in-chief Predrag Popoviƒá later admitted to being tipped off about the Mar≈°iƒáanin story by the Serbian secret police.Seks partijski neprijatelj broj jedan!;Alo!, November 2010 In May 2013, talking about the Serbian tabloids' modus operandi and business model, Serbian Journalists' Association president Ljiljana Smajloviƒá brought up Nacional's 2001 Mar≈°iƒáanin story as \\"the very first instance in Serbia of an important political or business figure undergoing character assassination in the tabloids where the target gets dragged through mud via a sustained campaign that goes on day after day and sometimes even ends up lasting for weeks or months\\". She added: \\"The 'success' of the Mar≈°iƒáanin episode, in that those who started it got what they were after as he soon resigned his post and from that point on basically became political roadkill that would within a few years leave politics altogether, led to the same model being replicated over and over again. Ever since then, Serbian tabloids have become potent and powerful political tools. Specific information is leaked to them by the people in positions of power in an effort to incriminate or defame rivals\\".Na≈° gost - Ljiljana Smajloviƒá;GEM televizija, 28 May 2013 In February 2002, the newspaper score a bit of coup when it brought star columnist Bogdan Tirnaniƒá on board. =Ljiljana Buha letters and campaign against Zoran ƒêinƒëiƒá= Throughout 2002, Nacional ran a series of stories painting Serbian prime minister Zoran ƒêinƒëiƒá in extremely negative light. They started with a piece claiming ƒêinƒëiƒá rang in New Year 2002 at a lavish party in Dubai where the bill got footed by known criminals and fugitives from Serbian justice system. Later that year, the paper began publishing a series of letters supposedly written by Ljiljana Buha, estranged wife of politically connected Serbian businessman with underworld ties Ljubi≈°a \\"ƒåume\\" Buha, in which she purportedly claims that Serbian organized crime has infiltrated the highest levels of political power in Serbia, specifically singling out prime minister ƒêinƒëiƒá and his political circle of friends and allies. Though most of the claims from Nacional's Ljiljana Buha letters were in time proven to be either exaggerations or outright fabrications, including strong likelihood that the letters weren't even written by Ljiljana Buha, but by members of the Zemun Clan, the letters managed their primary aim of politically damaging ƒêinƒëiƒá and his government. More details of the entire episode came out over the years since. In Milo≈° Vasiƒá's 2005 book Atentat, the 2001-2003 Serbian deputy prime minister ƒåedomir Jovanoviƒá claimed that during the period when Nacional published the Buha letters and accompanying anti-ƒêinƒëiƒá pieces, Nacional editor-in-chief Predrag Popoviƒá met with ƒêinƒëiƒá in October 2002 \\"admitting to the prime minister sheepishly and remorsefully that he'd taken money to publish the Ljiljana Buha letters because he needs to make a living before offering to stop the whole thing for ‚Ç¨50,000\\". Jovanoviƒá added that ƒêinƒëiƒá agreed to pay up, but that the Nacional campaign against him continued. =Banned by government and folding= On 18 March 2003, using its broad powers under the state of emergency act, Serbian government's Ministry of Culture and Information headed by Branislav Leƒçiƒá issued a temporary ban on publication of Nacional due to \\"publishing a number of articles relating to the state of emergency and for questioning the reasons behind the state of emergency\\". Then on 1 April 2003, the Belgrade city commercial court started liquidation proceedings against Nacional's publisher in Belgrade, Info Orfej. Despite the fact that they were not met either one of three possible conditions for liquidation of company, that company, by the annual accounts have expressed a profit of around 23 million dinars, that all contributions was paid, the company was liquidated, and 50 employees for indefinite time (of which 32 journalist) and 72 associates, lost their jobs and the means of work (118 computers, 120 desks and other equipment for communications). The company was seized on 21 April 2003, two days before the state of emergency ended. After a year, the Supreme Commercial Court abolished liquidation and the Constitutional Court of Serbia announced that the decision of quench of the media in the state of emergency was unconstitutional.

The historic preservation group lead local efforts protect historic property in the Sarasota-Bradenton area from commercial development. The group later expanded its scope to include environmental conservation. Its most notable project was the preservation of Seagate, the former home of Cincinnati, Ohio, industrialist Powel Crosley Jr. and his wife, Gwendolyn, and its later owners, Mabel and Freeman Horton. (Horton was a civil engineer who proposed the construction of the original Sunshine Skyway Bridge across Tampa Bay.) In 2002 the organization tried to secure Rus-in- Ur'be, an undeveloped parcel of land in the center of the Indian Beach Sapphire Shores neighborhood, as a local park; however, as of 2014, real estate developers intend to build condominium units at the site. History Kafi Benz, founder of Friends of Seagate In the late 1980s Kafi Benz founded the Friends of Seagate, a nonprofit historic preservation organization, to champion the preservation of portions of Seagate, a historic, property in Manatee County, Florida. Preservation projects The Friends of Seagate is best known for its efforts to preserve the Seagate estate along Sarasota Bay. The bay-front property was acquired by the State of Florida in the early 1990s. The present-day, Powel Crosley Estate serves as an event rental facility. A parcel of the property is the present- day site of the University of South Florida Sarasota-Manatee campus. Seagate's distinctive weathervane atop it tower was th inspiration for the organization's logo. Following public acquisition of the Seagate property, the nonprofit organization's objectives expanded to include broader community development, conservation, and preservation issues that involvedg other archaeological, artistic, cultural, built and natural environmental, and historical concerns.Listing in Florida Administrative Weekly, volume 28, number 50, State of Florida, December 13, 2002 documenting participation in environmental preservation through a $1.5 million acquisition grant to Friends of Seagate in partnership with local city government to purchase land for a park in the Indian Beach Sapphire Shores neighborhood in Sarasota Lake Underwood, a patron to Friends of Seagate, provided much of the funding and equipment for the expansion of the organization. =Seagate=Ownership Seagate Platted as a residential subdivision named Sea Gate in 1925, Cincinnati, Ohio, industrialist Powel Crosley Jr. acquired the property that became known as Seagate in 1929. Crosley had a two-and-a-half- story Mediterranean Revival style house, built on the site on Sarasota Bay for his wife, Gwendolyn, who died there in 1939. Crosley rarely used the home after her death and sold the property in 1947. Powel Crosley, Jr. in 1940s ad - Sarasota History Center Seagate changed ownership several times, and several unsuccessful plans were submitted for its commercial development, until a local campaign for its preservation resulted in the property's public acquisition. Subsequent owners included Mabel and Freeman Horton, who was a civil engineer who proposed the construction of the original Sunshine Skyway Bridge across Tampa Bay. The Horton family lived at Seagate from 1948 until 1977. The Campeau Corporation of American purchased Seagate in the early 1980s for development into a condominium project, but the condominium market in Florida collapsed shortly after Campeau acquired the property and the company's plans to convert the home and auxiliary buildings into a clubhouse and headquarters of the development were never realized. However, the company was successful it its efforts to have the Crosley estate was formally added to the National Register of Historic Places on January 21, 1983.The unusual listing included all of the remaining of the property. Most historic listings only include structures. See In 1990 the State of Florida acquired the property, which was divided into two portions. The bay front residence and were overseen by Manatee County, Florida. The much larger, eastern portion of the property along Tamiami Trail was overseen by New College and University of South Florida until their separation and the resulting development of this portion into a new satellite campus for the university. Preservation efforts In the late 1980s Kafi Benz founded Friends of Seagate Inc., a local, nonprofit preservation organization, and initiated a campaign for Seagate's preservation. Benz and her group also began a fundraising effort for its acquisition.Sarasota Magazine, May 1, 1992 Benz, the Friends and Seagate, and area residents successfully opposed several proposals for the property's commercial development. See also: Prior to the property's public acquisition in the early 1990s, the property was assessed for its archaeological, architectural, biological, cultural, environmental, and historical aspects. Dudley E. DeGroot, See also: Also: Also: a member of the Friends of Seagate board of directors, led an archaeological survey of the area that Benz conducted and registered.Benz was listed as a contributor to 0An Historic Resources Survey of the Coastal Zone of Sarasota County, Florida, prepared for the Sarasota County Board of County Commissioners, Sarasota County Department of Natural Resources, and the Sarasota County Department of Historical Resources by the University of South Florida Department of Anthropology, Tampa, Florida for the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation per CM.235 Agreement for Cultural Resources Management; March 1990, pp. 5, 210‚Äì13. \\"...A great deal of information was generously shared by colleagues and concerned Sarasota County residents. We wish to acknowledge the special contributions of the following: ... Kafi Benz, Dudley deGroot ...\\" (p. 5.) Jerris Foote, a fellow director with Benz of the Sarasota Alliance for Historic Preservation, Inc., also participated in the survey.. The archaeological survey was provided to Frank Perkins IV, the Manatee County property appraiser, for inclusion in the assessment and proposal for Seagate's public acquisition. Public acquisition and redevelopment In 1990 the state of Florida acquired the property, which was divided into two parcels. The Manatee County Commission paid $1.6 million in 1991 for the bay-front residence and of land, intending to preserve and renovate the property. The present-day Crosley Estate has been restored. It is used as a meeting, conference, and event rental venue. sometimes referred to as the Crosley mansion. The estate is aided by fundraising efforts of the Crosley Estate Foundation. The University of South Florida controlled of the property, which it acquired for $2 million for future expansion if a satellite campus for the Tampa-based university along Tamiami Trail. The design process for the University of South Florida's satellite campus (the present-day University of South Florida Sarasota-Manatee) was extensive. Kafi Benz participated in a design charrette that lasted several days, providing tours of the property and suggesting many details to the design team. The location of the campus's three-story building is derived from a plan that Benz proposed, which included use of open space on the parcel of land in order to preserve the uplands slash pine forest that dominated the eastern portion of the property. Although Benz's initial design plan was built, the university sacrificed the pine forest to reduce costs. Instead of constructing a planned parking facility, the university created surface parking. Except for a small stand in which gopher tortoise habitat existed, most of the mature pine trees were lost to a clear-cut of the land that would become the campus parking lot. A new entrance driveway also divided a small stand of pine trees. The driveway was elevated to accommodate tunnels designed for animals to use to avoid crossing the roadway. The former wetlands on the property was excavated to create a storm- water retention area landscaped to resemble a lake. Oak seedlings were planted in the landscaped islands created among the rows of asphalt. The university projected that it would outgrow the facility within twenty years. Wildlife habitat Documentation by the state of a breeding pair of eagles in a registered nest on the Seagate property contributed to preservation efforts An eagle nest found on the Seagate property was registered through Florida's department of environmental protection. It was designated as nest \\"Number Nine\\" for Manatee County after the state completed its assessment. Photographer Arthur E. \\"Mike\\" DeLoach, a board member of Friends of Seagate, assisted with the documentation. In addition, the property was the subject of other environmental studies that indicated the habitat supported two populations of gopher tortoise; the concomitant animals associated with that habitat, such as indigo snakes; and the registered eagle nesting site. Other birds associated with the site include hawks, osprey, owls, woodpeckers, and waders, such as the roseate spoonbill. A great rookery of herons and egrets also took advantage of the isolated property. Horseshoe crabs used the secluded beach as a breeding location. A small portion of the natural habitat remains to the north of the Crosley home, beyond the yacht basin. A narrow beachfront extends into the bay from a steep bank that was enlarged by fill that was dumped from dredges for access to the basin beginning in 1929. Beyond the fill are a few exotic trees introduced for flood control and landscape value, but native vegetation remains among a few invasive species. Longleaf pine as well as second growth slash pine of great age remain in undisturbed areas. Plans for potential use of the remaining portion of the property must be presented to the county government officials for review. =Rus-in-Ur'be= Rus-in-Ur'be - marble plaque inset into a column of the main entrance, one of three original gateways to the property; roughly, it may be translated as, country in the city In November 2002 the Friends of Seagate partnered as the nonprofit environmental entity with the Sarasota municipal government as the eligible local governmental entity for a grant of $1,505,625 through the Florida Communities Trust's \\"Florida Forever Program,\\" a state conservation and recreation lands acquisition grant program. The partners intended to hold the Rus In Ur'be property in the center of the Indian Beach Sapphire Shores neighborhood of Sarasota for use as a local park. The grant request was approved as part of the Series FF2 funding cycle, but the partners were unable to acquire it before the land was sold for private development.Parks and Open Space 2002 Funding Status Report, State of Florida, Florida Forever Cycle FF2, Florida Communities Trust - Department of Community Affairs, 2002. The parcel of more than contained a wooded and undeveloped land, wetlands, a tennis court, and a Sarasota School of Architecture structure that served as a private clubhouse or recreational lounge for a bay-front home on Bay Shore Road opposite the property. (The Bay Shore Road home was sold separately from the Rus In Ur'be and held by a real estate developer.) The timber-framed clubhouse of pecky cypress included a roof with glazed blue Japanese ceramic tiles and expansive glass partitions along the western elevation, facing the tennis courts. The clubhouse structure and the tennis courts were demolished. The property was subsequently cleared and surveyed, then platted for development with single-family homes. A private road was paved through the parcel, but no structures were built prior to the downturn of the real estate market as the speculation boom of the 1990s and 2000s collapsed. Other development projects have been proposed for the vacant parcel of land, but local residents opposed them. Some of the neighborhood residents still wanted the remaining undeveloped property to be a community park; however, a real estate developer purchased two parcels of vacant land in 2014, intending to build single-family homes and condominium units on the sites.

Directed by Jack Bender, it was broadcast in two parts on October 23 and 24, 1994. The drama centers on the life chronology of a Hollywood actress who becomes a successful film director in an era when directing was dominated by men. Plot Starting in 1951, Faye Price is a famous Hollywood actress who, while entertaining the troops during the Korean War, falls in love with Ward Thayer, a rich heir. Seven years later, they are married, with four children. Ward loses his job and considers suicide, but Faye offers to start acting again. Originally, this upsets Ward, because he was not fond of moving to Fairfax, California. On the set of her new movie, the director and producer fight each other and the director eventually leaves the set. Faye offers to direct the scene herself. At first, nobody thinks she will be able to, but she turns out to direct the scene with a lot of success. She is soon offered directing jobs at television series, including Zane Grey Theater. Meanwhile, her home life is less fortunate. Ward has been depressed since going bankrupt and he has started an affair. When Faye finds out, she immediately kicks him out of the house. However, she soon agrees to give him another chance and they decide to work together on films as director and producer. Their film debut becomes a blockbuster success with positive reviews and she is contracted by Universal. Years later, their children have grown up. Lionel is a student, hoping to be a photographer one day, Greg is still in school and wants to become a football player, Valerie is an actress waiting for her big break and Anne is the quiet youngest sister. Greg admits his grades aren't good enough and that he dropped out of school to join the army. Lionel shocks his parents by admitting he is gay. Faye is surprised, but accepts the news. Ward, however, is outraged and cuts him out of his life, with forbidding his other children to ever contact him again. Anne is furious and decides to run away. Faye is devastated, but can't afford to quit her job and look for her. Soon, Greg announces he will serve for the army in Vietnam. The entire family comes together to say goodbye, but Ward refuses to speak to Lionel. Later, Faye receives a phone call from the police, informing her that Anne has been arrested for drug possession. Faye picks her up and is shocked to find out she is pregnant. Ward convinces her to try to make her give up her child. Anne is in tears after giving birth, but reluctantly agrees to give up the baby for adoption. Tragedy reaches the Thayer family when it is announces that Greg died in Da Nang, only a few days before peace was declared. At the funeral, Ward finally acknowledges his now only son Lionel, but still has trouble accepting that he is gay. Meanwhile, Faye is nominated for an Oscar. Valerie is jealous of her mother's success and they get into a fight when she announces she dropped out of UCLA for the lead role in a cheap horror film, for which she is required to go nude. The Oscar nomination takes all of Faye's time. This makes Anne feel very neglected and she starts to hang out at her friend's place a lot. During this time, she bonds with the father of this family, Bill O'Hara. Faye finally decides to forgive Ward and they reunite. Soon, the Thayer family deal with a second tragedy, when Lionel and his boyfriend John get into a car accident. Lionel survives, but John dies. He has trouble dealing with his loss and spends all his time working as a photographer. Later, Anne upsets her parents by admitting she is dating the much older Bill. Ward is furious and confronts Bill with the fact he is seeing a 17-year-old girl. However, Anne and Bill are still determined to marry and it doesn't take long before she gets pregnant again. Meanwhile, Valerie finally gets her big break, when she is given the second lead role in her mother's newest film project. The lead player, George Waterson, at first treats her badly, because he thinks she is a horrible actress. However, she eventually wins his heart and they start a secret relationship. Lionel finds love as well, with Paul Steel, a drug addicted actor who was recently fired. In the end, the movie directed by Faye and starring Valerie becomes a great success and Val enjoys her overnight stardom. Later, Anne gives birth to a son. The labor and baby reminds her of her first pregnancy and she blames her mother for having given up her first baby. Ten years later, Val makes Anne realize that Faye was actually a great mother, but didn't have a lot of time. Anne tries to apologize, but she is too afraid. Suddenly, Faye dies. Anne feels guilty for not having apologized, but Ward assures her that Faye knew how much she loved her. Differences between the film and the novel. * In the novel, Valerie is one of a set of twins.

The election was important for the bitterness of the contest between the Coalition and Independent factions within the Liberal Party and the deepening of this division within the party as a factor in the long-term decline of Liberalism in Wales. Vacancy The by-election was caused by the desire of Prime Minister David Lloyd George to find a Parliamentary seat for his private secretary Captain Ernest Evans.Michael Kinnear, The Fall of Lloyd George: The Political Crisis of 1922; University of Toronto Press, 1973 pp. 190‚Äì191 Lloyd George persuaded the sitting Coalition Liberal MP, Matthew Vaughan-Davies, who had represented the constituency for more than twenty-five years,The Times, 1 January 1921 p. 10 to accept a peerage so creating an opportunity for Evans to enter Parliament.Ffion Hague, The Pain and the Privilege; Harper Press, 2008 p.384 Candidates=Coalition Liberals and Unionists= Unsurprisingly the Coalition Liberals chose Ernest Evans as their candidate. Evans was a lawyer. He had been called to the Bar in 1910 and after the First World War he became private secretary to Lloyd George. He held that post until 1920.The Times House of Commons 1935; Politico‚Äôs Publishing 2003 p.154 Evans was supported by Lloyd George's Unionist partners in the Coalition government.The Times, 28 January 1921 p.10 =Liberal split= At first it was reported that Evans might not be opposed as he was a Cardiganshire man; his father was Clerk to the County Council.The Times, 3 January 1921 p.12 However, the local Liberal Association was representative of both Coalition and Independent Liberal wings of the party and neither group had a permanent advantage over the other. Attempts by those opposed to the Coalition had earlier tried to ensure that any replacement for Vaughan-Davies would not be another Coalition Liberal but although this resolution passed the executive committee, it was never ratified by the membership.Kinnear, The Fall of Lloyd George p.191 Once Vaughan‚ÄìDavies' peerage was announced, a number of other possible by-election candidates put their names forward. First it was announced that Sir Lewes Loveden Pryse, a local land owner, would stand in the by-election as a Liberal Anti-Waste candidate.The Times, 4 January 1921 p. 10 A number of by-elections at this time were contested by members of the Anti-Waste League a political party founded in 1921 by Lord Rothermere. The party campaigned against what they saw as excessive government spending. It is not clear if Loveden Pryse was formally connected to the Anti-waste League or if he just taking advantage of a well-known political position close to his own views. To resolve the issue of its choice of candidate, the Cardiganshire Liberal Association invited five potential candidates to address a meeting of the Association and to invite them to accept the outcome of the democratic decision, to use the secretary of the Association as their election agent, and to state if they were Coalitionists or 'free and independent Liberals'.The Times, 24 January 1921 p.10 These men were Evans, Loveden Pryse, W. Llewelyn Williams, KC the former MP for Carmarthen and Recorder of Cardiff and two local Aldermen, J M Howell and D C Roberts.The Times, 7 January 1921 p. 11 Howell refused to attend the meeting and announced that he supported Lloyd George. In the meantime at a meeting in London of the newly formed Welsh Independent Liberal Association, attended by Llewelyn Williams, it was decided that if Cardiganshire Liberals chose a Coalition Liberal candidate, they would oppose him.The Times, 8 January 1921 p. 14 As the other possible candidates dropped out of contention, the choice for Cardiganshire Liberals crystallised between Evans and Llewelyn Williams. Evans declared that if the Association selected a candidate who would not support the Coalition, he would stand anyway.The Times, 24 January p.10 In the event, at a rowdy meeting, Cardiganshire Liberals voted to adopt Llewelyn Williams. Of the 350 delegates invited to the selection meeting on 26 January 1921, 347 attended and voted by a majority of 206 to 127 in favour of Llewelyn Williams.The Times, 26 January 1921 p.10 The election which followed led to the re-emergence of tensions within Cardiganshire Liberalism, which had lain dormant for years, between the rural areas of the hinterland and the middle-class seaside towns. It was in the rural areas that Williams found the greatest levels of support. =Labour= The Labour Party stated they had a candidate ready to stand if the outcome of the Liberal selection process produced a candidate who was unacceptable to them. It was assumed, that given Labour's opposition to the Coalition, that if Evans was chosen therefore Labour would contest the election. In the end however they chose not to do so and Llewelyn Williams claimed he had secured Labour's wholehearted support in the by-election.The Times, 29 January 1921 p. 10 He later received the public support of William Harris the organiser of the South Wales Miners' Federation who declared it was the duty of Labour to vote against the present government which, he said, was the enemy of the working man.The Times, 8 February 1921 p. 10 Issues=Agriculture= Agricultural policy was an early issue raised in the election. This was because the Cardiganshire Farmers' Union, a generally pro-Conservative organisation, held a meeting to question Captain Evans and decided to ask all candidates the same series of questions. They wanted to know if the candidates approved of farmers having to give up land to ex-soldiers, if they would support a reduction in the number of government inspectors supervising farmers and their work, particularly those operating under the Wages Boards. Although Loveden Pryse decided not to put himself up as a candidate, the issue of waste and government expenditure was raised in the election. The farmers wanted to know if the candidates would oppose increased spending on education, public health, land settlement and housing. Despite the conservatism of the country people it was reported that Llewelyn Williams was receiving a good reception in the rural areas.The Times, 2 February 1921 p. 7 =Waste= Llewelyn Williams picked up the Anti-Waste theme and declared that it was not by returning a tame official of the government that the Coalition could be held to account for its extravagance and its loss of control over the nation's finances.The Times, 3 February 1921 p. 10 =The record of the Coalition and the position of Lloyd George= Llewelyn Williams tried to rally traditional Liberal support by emphasising the influence in Lloyd George's government of the Conservatives (who were in the majority in the Coalition). He would be happy to support the Prime Minister he said, when he got rid of the Curzons, Carsons, Balfours and Bonar Laws who only a few years before had been trying to cut his political throat over the Marconi case.The Times, 31 January 1921 p. 11 Llewelyn Williams was fiercely opposed to Lloyd George, his one-time friend,Kenneth O Morgan, Wales in British Politics: 1868-1922; University of Wales Press, 1963 pp. 295‚Äì296 whom he had broken with over the issue of conscription in 1916. According to one historian, Llewelyn Williams was paranoid about Lloyd George calling him a 'dictator' and a 'little devil who plagues us so.'Kenneth O Morgan, Consensus and Disunity: The Lloyd George Coalition Government 1918-1922; OUP 1979 pp. 198‚Äì199 He also disliked intensely the government action against nationalist forces in Ireland and the use of the so-called Black and Tans. Llewelyn Williams sought to counter Evans' credentials as a Cardiganshire man by getting his wife to make an appeal to women voters as a native of the county. This appeal was however decisively trumped by the appearance in the constituency of the wife of the Prime Minister. Mrs Lloyd George made a visit lasting four days in support of Captain Evans when she was received enthusiastically with bouquets and brass bands according to one sourceP J Madgwick, N Griffiths & V Walker, The Politics of Rural Wales: A Study of Cardiganshire; Hutchison, 1973 p46 and addressed a special meeting of women at Aberystwyth. Her campaigning concluded only on election day itself with a tour of polling stations and a last minute plea for votes published in the Cambrian News.Hague, The Pain and the Privilege; Harper Press, 2008 p. 389 Evans based his appeal on the reasons for maintaining the Coalition after 1918 and appealed for loyalty to Lloyd George as a great Welshman and war hero. There was an unashamed appeal to patriotism. Mrs Lloyd George told electors that the Germans were anxiously watching the result of the contest and the Cambrian News published a cartoon showing Prussian Militarism trying in vain to woo Miss Cardiganshire away from Lloyd George.Madgwick, Griffiths & Walker, The Politics of Rural Wales, p 47 Evans associated himself with the points made by Lloyd George at the executive meeting of the Welsh National Liberals on 8 February 1921. These were chiefly, the recognition that the emergency extended into the post-war phase; the need for national unity to face the challenges of the economy and demobilization after the war; the need for unity to enforce the post-war international settlement agreed at the Paris Peace Conference and the moves to find a solution to the question of Home Rule for Ireland.The Times, 9 February 1921 p. 12 In a letter of support to Evans, Conservative leader Bonar Law also made similar points about the need for national unity and government o be carried on in a non-partisan way.The Times, 10 February 1921 p. 10 Loyalty to the Prime Minister as a great Welsh figure was also reported to have been a factor in swaying the voters.The Times, 21 February 1921 p. 11 =Religion= One topic which was reported to have been a dead issue in the election was the Church question, a policy which for a generation was the central and burning issue of Welsh politics. Violet Bonham Carter tried to raise the issue in a speech at Aberystwyth, attacking Lloyd George for re-endowing the Anglican Church with taxpayers' money. But it seemed to leave the audience cold. The many sects in the Welsh Nonconformism found themselves divided between the different candidates, a dilemma with which they were highly unfamiliarThe Times, 16 February 1921 p. 12 and perhaps this lack of unity served to lessen the profile and importance of the disestablishment tradition. However, Evans was a Methodist, which was the dominant denomination in the area,Kenneth O Morgan, Consensus and Disunity: The Lloyd George Coalition Government 1918-1922; OUP 1979 p. 199 as was Mrs Lloyd GeorgeHague, The Pain and the Privilege; p. 385 while most supporters of Llewelyn Williams were Congregationalists. Ministers of religion frequently appeared on political platforms and political factionalism within the Liberal tradition spilled over into the politics of the chapels both between the demoninantions and within.Madgwick, Griffiths & Walker, The Politics of Rural Wales p. 48 So religion certainly seems to have been, after all, more of factor than was believed by commentators at the time. =Polling day= In this respect the Coalition had an advantage. In particular they were able to make use of many more motor vehicles to get their supporters to the poll which was important in a constituency like Cardiganshire which was full of outlying villages and farms. On election day it was said that 250 motor cars, mostly owned by Conservative backers of the Coalition, were brought out for the purpose of ferrying voters to the polling stations and this was a significant factorJenny Rees, Looking for Mr Nobody: The Secret Life of Goronwy Rees; Transaction Books, 2000 p. 25 whereas Independent Liberals could muster only 50 cars in response.Hague, The Pain and the Privilege; p. 389 Result In what was reported to have been an unexpectedly heavy poll of 80%, Captain Evans won the seat for the Coalition by a majority of 3,590 votes.Craig, F. W. S. (1969). British parliamentary election results 1918-1949 (1 ed.). Glasgow: Political Reference Publications. . Page 550 Ernest Evans Despite this, the many votes received by Llewelyn Williams, the fact that Cardiganshire Liberal Association had chosen an Asquithian over Lloyd George's candidate and the bitterness engendered in the campaign all sounded a warning to the Prime Minister for the future support of his Coalition and the risks to the unity and the future of the Liberal Party in Wales and beyond. As the historian David Powell has commented \\"Internecine war of this sort was inevitably damaging to Liberal unity and Liberal morale. It also prevented either Liberal faction from claiming undisputed right to the Liberal name and tradition and was doubly confusing to potential voters at a time when electoral loyalties were in a state of flux.\\"David Powell, British Politics 1910-1935:The Crisis of the Party System; Routledge, 2004 p. 103 The damage was exemplified by the support Llewelyn Williams received from a number of literary and intellectual figures and from the representatives of organised Labour. Liberal divisions made so public during the course of the by-election undermined the previously unassailable hold the Liberals had had on the Welsh intelligentsia which began increasingly to switch its allegiance to Labour.Kinnear, The Fall of Lloyd George; p. 192 Aftermath Evans retained the seat at the following General Election, again against another Liberal challenger; See also * List of United Kingdom by-elections (1918‚Äì1931) * United Kingdom by-election records ReferencesBibliography  Further reading  A Vision Of Britain Through Time (Constituency elector numbers) 1921 elections in the United Kingdom By-elections to the Parliament of the United Kingdom in Welsh constituencies Elections in Ceredigion 1921 in Wales 1920s elections in Wales ","title":"1921 Cardiganshire by-election"},{"id":"23752614","text":"Heart is a 1987 film directed by James Lemmo.

This site was bombed during the Blitz in 1940, and temporary lodgings were occupied at Butchers' Hall in Bartholomew Close between 1941 and 1944 until that too was bombed. Its post-War situation was somewhat more permanent, with the 1944 move to Sion College on the Embankment. The 1996 closure of much of the college meant that new premises had to be found ‚Äì at the Insurance Hall on Aldermanbury, and the club moved again to the Baltic Exchange on St. Mary Axe in 2003. It was most recently based in the premises of the Little Ship Club on Bell Wharf Lane.

Gameplay The player explores a new, randomly generated dungeon for each adventure. The player encounters monsters and human enemies, and experience points are awarded based on the disparity between the character's and the monster's statistics. The players' primary goal is the recovery of a treasure hidden on the deepest level which is guarded by a particularly effective team of monsters.

It also was not completely rewritten from the ground up, but instead contained the original Z80 code from the TRS-80 with an interpreter to convert it to x86 assembly language. Reception Dunzhin was reviewed in Dragon magazine #71 by John Warren.

The competition was contested by all 18 first-class counties, as well as 10 minor counties and the national teams of Scotland, Ireland, the Netherlands and Denmark, to make up a full 32-team tournament. The final was won by the Hampshire Hawks, who beat the Warwickshire Bears by 18 runs at Lord's on 3 September 2005. This would be the final year that the competition was held as a knock-out only format and was also the final year to date in which the minor counties also participated. It would be the first year white balls and coloured clothing was used although red balls and white clothing were still used in the early stages in matches between first class counties and the minor counties. Format The eighteen first-class counties were joined by 10 minor counties ‚Äì Bedfordshire, Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Devon, Northumberland, Shropshire, Staffordshire, Suffolk, Wales Minor Counties and Wiltshire ‚Äì as well as the national teams of Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands and Scotland. Teams who won in the first round progressed to the second round, those who won in the second round progressed to the quarter-finals. Winner from the quarter-finals progressed to the semi-finals and winners from that round progressed to the final at Lord's, which was held on 3 September 2005. Fixtures=First Round= The first round was held on 3‚Äì5 May. While some upsets looked possible at times, with teams such as the Netherlands, Berkshire and Staffordshire threatening their first-class opponents, there were no first round surprises. Two of the games featured two first-class sides: Durham lost to Derbyshire by one wicket off the last ball; Somerset were edged out by Leicestershire in a very low-scoring thriller. Northamptonshire's Charl Pietersen took 7 for 10 at Svanholm Park, Br√∏ndby as Denmark fell to the competition's second lowest score in its history, for 56 all out. 24 of those runs were extras, with no Dane scoring more than 8 with the bat. Pietersen, who was playing in his debut match for the Northants first team said, \\"The ball was swinging about and they were perfect conditions for bowling. I just concentrated on getting the ball in the right areas and the conditions did the rest. I'm grateful for the opportunity I've been given by Northants. I'm here to learn and try to get myself in the first team on a regular basis. No cricketer wants to play second-team cricket and I'm no different. But one performance won't get me in, I've got to be consistent with my wicket-taking and my economy.\\" It took Northamptonshire one ball less than 17 overs to make 59 for 2 to win the match just before lunch as the Danes were humbled. Afterwards the Danish coach said, \\"We knew it was going to be difficult. We are short of money but we are trying to develop every time we play against different opposition. We have a lot of young players and it was good for them to test themselves against the professionals.\\" (BBC scorecard)  Nick Knight made 108 in Rotterdam to take Warwickshire to 237 for 5, despite five maidens being bowled by the Dutch. In reply Holland were 101 for 4 off 27 overs when rain prevented play for the first day, leaving them 137 to win off 23 overs on the second day. Daan van Bunge was doing well with 37 off 37 balls at close. Van Bunge was the mainstay of the reply on the second day, and the Dutch looked good as long as he and Billy Stelling were at the crease, and they led the way to 205 for 5 before Stelling was caught off Neil Carter. That precipitated a collapse, as the last 4 wickets went for 9 runs, and Warwickshire managed a 23-run victory. (BBC scorecard)  Berkshire did well at their home ground in Reading. Despite 80 from Phil Weston, Gloucestershire only made 223 from 49.3 overs. Apart from a second-wicket partnership worth 118 between Weston and Chris Taylor, wickets fell regularly, leaving the minor county in with a clear chance. Berkshire progressed well in reply, reaching 69 for 2 off 14 overs when rain halted play for the day. On the second day, however, Berkshire soon capitulated for 138, as Sri Lankan spinner Upul Chandana took 4 for 27. The last eight wickets fell for 26 runs. (BBC scorecard)  Andrew Crook scored freely for Lancashire at Sir Paul Getty's Ground at Wormsley as he broke Lancashire's one-day record with his 162 not out. Glen Chapple gave support as he scored the competition's fastest ever half-century, making 55 in just 16 balls as the first-class team finished on 370 for 4. They were denied the chance to wrap up the win on the first day though, as rain halted play with Buckinghamshire on 39 for 2. No play was possible on the second day, and with 10.3 overs of Buckinghamshire's innings bowled, a decision was possible on the Duckworth-Lewis method.(BBC scorecard)  No play was possible on the first day at Exmouth because of rain. When play started on what was a wettish pitch with a slow outfield Essex hit over the top and ended on 264 for 5 off their 50 overs, with Andy Flower and Ravinder Bopara recording half-centuries. Devon were not competitive in reply and soon succumbed, making only 84, although that could be seen as a recovery from 23 for 6 - a position they were in thanks to Essex pacers Andre Adams and Darren Gough, who took three wickets each with the new ball. Neil Hancock, who turned out in two Twenty20 games and one National League match for Somerset in 2004, top scored with 40 despite batting at seven. (Cricinfo scorecard)  Ireland, trying to emulate their success in this competition against Surrey the previous year, fared poorly on the first day at Belfast. After being put into bat by Yorkshire, the visitors' fast bowler Matthew Hoggard took two wickets to help reduce them to 33 for 3 when rain put an end to proceedings for the day after 12.3 overs. After the play that was possible, Irish vice- captain Kyle McCallan said, \\"It was disappointing losing our top three batsmen so early on. But our strength is in our depth of batting. It's not the end of the world at the moment and we're still hoping to post a total of around 200.\\" On the second day they achieved this, reaching 201 thanks to half-centuries from Eoin Morgan and Peter Gillespie, but it was never going to be enough against Yorkshire. Half-centuries from Ian Harvey, Michael Vaughan and Phil Jaques saw the visitors home with 15 balls to spare as they made 202 for 4.(BBC scorecard)  Rain meant there was no play on the first day at Jesmond. On a second day where plenty of runs were available, Northumberland put on 206 for 8 with Stephen Humble making an unbeaten 88 from number 8 in the batting order. Middlesex in the shape of Ed Smith and Paul Weekes knocked them off in just 31.3 overs. Weekes ended up with 106, Middlesex' first List A century of the season. (BBC scorecard)  Kent came close to being humiliated by the minor county Wiltshire at Salisbury as they were bowled out for 160, with Kevin Nash taking 4 for 46. In reply, Wiltshire were always in with a chance, but lost wickets regularly, with Simon Cook taking 4 for 22. However, with 10 runs needed off the last over, Nash was run out to seal a Kent win. (BBC scorecard)  Bedfordshire batted first at Luton. They progressed slowly, making their first 50 in the 23rd over. Whilst they improved to 143 for 9 in their 50 overs, it was never going to be enough. By way of comparison, it took Sussex six overs to reach their first 50, with Ian Ward (65 off 44) scoring most of the early runs, although admittedly batting was easier on the drying pitch. Sussex overhauled their modest target with 31.3 overs to go - almost two thirds of their allotted quota. (Cricinfo scorecard)  Durham put on 234 in their 50 overs at Chester-le-Street, mostly thanks Paul Collingwood, who scored 82 from 83 balls. Spin bowler Ant Botha took 4 for 44. In reply, Steve Harmison performed well, trapping Michael Di Venuto lbw with his third ball and, in a hostile and accurate spell, had Hassan Adnan caught at first slip. He ended with three for 45. Derbyshire were wobbling, but anchored by Chris Bassano who eked out 57 from 104 balls. This, along with 50 from Graeme Welch, kept Derbyshire in the game, but it needed a tenth wicket partnership of 16 between Botha and Kevin Dean to see them through on the last ball of the game. (Cricinfo scorecard)  It was an unusual game at Grace Road, which was all done by 3.30pm. The ball swung greatly, and there was seam movement, and Charl Willoughby of Leicestershire made the most of them first, taking 6 for 16 as Somerset were dismissed for 94 - though it could have been much worse, as they were 58 for 9 before Ian Blackwell and Simon Francis attacked and added 36 for the last wicket. Marcus Trescothick, the Somerset captain, who only made 11 said, \\"Conditions were not conducive to one-day cricket, that's for sure. Unfortunately, we lost the toss and had the worst of it, but we still thought we could win because we have more consistent length bowlers. Even 130 or so could have been a great score.\\" Leicestershire themselves struggled in reply, and Somerset took wickets regularly, reducing the hosts to 70 for 7. However, they were not able to take another, as Leicestershire ended on 96 for 7 - Ottis Gibson and Claude Henderson adding 26 for the eighth wicket, Leicestershire's highest partnership of the match. (Cricinfo scorecard)  The first day at The Grange saw no play because of rain. After losing the toss, Scotland were put in, and the bowlers immediately made it very difficult for Scotland. It took them six overs to make their first ten runs, and every time they tried to accelerate, they lost wickets. In the end, they could only muster 134 all out in 46.5 overs. Vikram Solanki and Stephen Moore made this target look easy, passing the required 135 runs without losing a wicket in 5 balls fewer than 20 overs. Both batsmen made half-centuries. (Cricinfo scorecard)  Shropshire batted first at Whitchurch, making only 132 as Shane Warne and Richard Logan took 3 wickets each. This was never a big enough target to hold off Hampshire. The crowd were treated to a powerful innings by England's new star one-day performer, Kevin Pietersen, who had been promoted to No. 1 in the batting order. He scored 76 off 49 balls in an innings that included six sixes and seven fours as Hampshire racked up 133 for 3 off 21.1 overs. (Cricinfo scorecard)  Last year, Surrey were knocked out in Round One of this Trophy by Ireland, and so they would have come to Leek determined to avoid the same ignominy this time round. Staffordshire did push them hard, however. Staffordshire batted first, and made 186, with 23 wides showing how inaccurate the Surrey bowling was. In reply, ex-Middlesex bowler, David Follett, took 3 for 13 to reduce Surrey to a worrying 47 for 4. Then Mark Ramprakash came in, who steaded the Surrey ship with 49, before he was run out, leaving Surrey 45 to win off 62 balls with 4 wickets left. Rikki Clarke and Martin Bicknell got most of them, as Surrey won with 192 for 7 with 7 balls to go, Bicknell winning the game with a six. (Cricinfo scorecard)  After rain, play only began at 3pm at Bury St Edmunds with Glamorgan batting first. The highlight of their innings was an undefeated 100 from Matthew Elliott in 104 balls, with his partners contributing usefully as the visitors racked up an imposing 320 for 5. Suffolk were never in contention, and to spare the need for the match going into a second day, play continued in near-darkness to 8.40pm, with Glamorgan bowling their last 32 overs (all with spin, in order to make conditions playable for batsmen) in 80 minutes. Staffordshire finally finished on 177 for 8 off their 50 overs, recovering from 69 for 6. (Cricinfo scorecard)  After a four-and-a-half hour rain delay, Wales Minor Counties batted first at Swansea, and fared poorly. The only score of any note came from Willy Bragg, an 18-year-old left-hander, currently in the middle of his A-Level exams. He made an undefeated 41 runs, as Wales Minor Counties were dismissed for 119. Mark Ealham took 4 for 28 and Andrew Harris 3 for 31. Nottinghamshire were never really threatened, but did lose 4 wickets in making 121 off 26.2 overs. (Cricinfo scorecard) =Second Round= The Second Round was played on 17 and 18 May. The surprise of the round was the elimination of defending champions Gloucestershire by a Surrey team that had lost all four of its one-day games against first-class counties up to that point in the season. At Derby, Derbyshire won the toss and chose to field against Kent, who scored 257 for 4 after healthy contributions from the entire top order, Geraint Jones top-scoring with 70 while Derbyshire's South African all-rounder Ant Botha took three for 40 with his left-arm spin. Martin Saggers (three for 21), Amjad Khan (one for 12) and Simon Cook (one for 22) then reduced Derbyshire to 27 for 5, and Derbyshire were never in the match from there. Eventually they were bowled out for 130 in 42.5 overs. (Cricinfo scorecard)  Zimbabwean all- rounder Sean Ervine and veteran wicket-keeper Nic Pothas made the most important contributions as Hampshire overpowered Glamorgan at Cardiff. Only Michael Powell showed some sort of resistance, scoring 56 in Glamorgan's 214, while Ervine took five for 50 from his ten overs - admittedly mostly tail- enders, but he got the most wickets. Chris Tremlett also took three for 32. Pothas then notched up the first limited-over century of the Hampshire season, scoring 114 not out off 127 balls and standing tall while Glamorgan's fast bowlers Andrew Davies and Simon Jones made inroads with the ball. England prospect Kevin Pietersen continued his fine form with 69 off 64 balls, including four sixes, as he shared a 130-run partnership with Pothas. Thanks to the quick scoring of Pothas and Pietersen, Hampshire won with nearly 11 overs to spare. (Cricinfo scorecard)  Surrey overcame their poor one-day form, with four losses in four National League games, to reach the quarter- finals in a close game at Bristol against Gloucestershire. Surrey won the toss and fielded first, restricting Gloucestershire to 230 for 8 after most of the Surrey bowlers got wickets. Chris Taylor made 74 and top-scored, but it was the all-rounder Alex Gidman who managed to keep his head calm, scoring 58 not out while the tail crashed to single figure scores around him. In reply, Surrey struggled to 110 for 4, losing wickets at key moments, but Rikki Clarke (62 not out) stood tall towards the end, taking the winning runs off James Averis with three balls and three wickets remaining in the innings. (Cricinfo scorecard)  Andrew Flintoff took 4 for 26 in helpful bowling conditions as Essex made only 195 for 9 at Old Trafford. In reply, Lancashire's opening partnership of Mal Loye and Stuart Law put on 53 in 10.1 overs, before Alex Tudor dismissed them both. Brad Hodge, however, kept the run rate up. Hodge was dropped on 32, and Lancashire might have been put under pressure if it had been taken, but instead he went on to make 82 off 102 balls, as Lancashire made there target with 6 wickets and 6 overs to spare. (Cricinfo scorecard)  Northamptonshire batted first at Lord's. Their top order performed well, with Usman Afzaal making 75 off 120 balls, and useful contributions from Bilal Shafayat (46) and David Sales (40). However, once they were out, 7 wickets fell for 40 runs, leaving them on 215 for 9, before Robert White smacked 36 to lift the visitors to 238. Middlesex got off to a good start, reaching 148 for 2 and 168 for 3, as opener Paul Weekes scored a century. However, then Damien Wright took 4 wickets for 1 in 7 balls, as Middlesex collapsed in more spectacular fashion than the visitors, losing their last 6 wickets for 8 runs. (Cricinfo scorecard)  Dougie Brown took a wicket in each of his first three overs to help a poor Warwickshire one-day side to victory at Edgbaston. Warwickshire batted first, and the hosts were on 78 for two after 15 overs, with Nick Knight (69) and Ian Bell (35) in control. Then Bell was stumped attacking a ball from Claude Henderson leaving the score on 116 for 3 in the 22nd over. There then was a collapse as 5 fell for 64, before Heath Streak and Tony Frost put on 55 in the last 9 overs to lift Warwickshire to 235. In Leicestershire's innings immediately faltered as Brown's wickets reduced them to 16 for 3. Brown was helped by good tight bowling from Heath Streak at the other end, which meant they chose to attack Brown. Leicestershire tried to rebuild, but never managed it, finally being dismissed for 152 with 6.3 overs to go. (Cricinfo scorecard)  Yorkshire batted first at Headingley and fared poorly at first, slumping to 88 for 4 when Michael Vaughan cut the ball from Zander de Bruyn onto his stumps. Craig White and Anthony McGrath then put on 83 in 22 overs, and late hitting gave Yorkshire a defendable total of 241 for 9 with 52 off the last 5 overs. The Worcestershire innings followed a similar course. First they were reduced to 50 for 3, and then Kabir Ali (67) and Zander de Bruyn (82) came together, putting on 117. White then interrupted them, taking three wickets. The run-chase was thus effectively curtailed, and Worcestershire finished well behind on 227 for 8. (Cricinfo scorecard)  Nottinghamshire got off to a bad start at Hove by losing their first 3 wickets for only 12 runs. They continued to lose wickets at regular intervals until the score moved on to 111 for 8, when Samit Patel (61) and Gareth Clough (22) came together and lifted the total to 195 for 9 off the 50 overs. Three Nottinghamshire batsmen were run out. Sussex immediately lost Ian Ward and Mike Yardy, moving to 1 run for 2 wickets. However, the ship was steadied with half-centuries from Murray Goodwin and Carl Hopkinson and they eventually eased through with 3 wickets and 18 balls to go. The win, however, came at a price for Sussex, who now had to play Lancashire away in the next round, rather than host the touring Australians in a 3-day game. The cost of the win was estimated at ¬£50,000. (Cricinfo scorecard) =Quarter-Finals= Andrew Symonds scored 101 and took two wickets for 46 to be the difference between the sides at Old Trafford. Having been sent in to bat, Lancashire owed much of their success to a partnership of 118 between Symonds and Marcus North, and good lower-order hitting took the total to 249 for 8, despite three wickets each from Sussex' Pakistanis, Rana Naved-ul-Hasan and Mushtaq Ahmed. The Sussex chase looked on when they were 112 for 1 with Matt Prior and Chris Adams at the crease, as they were just waiting for opportunities to up the run-rate, but instead Symonds and England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff ran through them with the ball, and Robin Martin-Jenkins and Ahmed eventually had to consolidate to 214 for 8, losing by 35 runs. (Cricinfo scorecard)  Despite an unbeaten 158 from Jonathan Batty, Surrey still lost their quarter- final game at The Oval, having first batted to make 358 for 6 in 50 overs. James Benning with 73, and Graham Thorpe with 60, also contributed, as Hampshire used seven bowlers who all failed to keep their conceded runs below six an over. In reply, Azhar Mahmood served up a wicket maiden over in the first over of Hampshire's innings, leaving Hampshire 359 to win with nine wickets in hand, but Shane Watson and Craig McMillan put the visitors from the south back on track with a partnership of 81 for the fourth wicket. When McMillan was run out, Hampshire were 200 for 4, but Watson powered on to make 132, his highest career List A cricket score to boost Hampshire to 342 for 8 when Tim Murtagh broke through his defences. By then, it was too late, as Shaun Udal completed his 44 not out, having added 63 with Watson for the eighth wicket earlier, and Hampshire made it to the target with thirteen balls to spare - although they had been given eleven extra balls due to no-balls and wides. (Cricinfo scorecard)  Andrew Hall and Robert Key gave Kent some hope of winning the match at Edgbaston with their opening partnership of 120 runs, but spinners Ashley Giles and Alex Loudon broke through twice each to limit the final score to 259 for 6. Warwickshire's reply centred on former England ODI player Nic Knight, who made fourteen fours in his 27th one-day century. Three wickets from Justin Kemp had earlier set Warwickshire back to 118 for 3, but Knight and Trevor Penney who made 50 not out off 43 balls, guided Warwickshire to the target with nearly four overs to spare. (Cricinfo scorecard)  Michael Lumb with 89 and Ian Harvey with 74 lifted Yorkshire to 270 all out at Headingley in the fourth quarter-final of the C&G; Trophy. It was a bit of an implosion from 227 for 3, but runs came thick and fast in that period, so Yorkshire wouldn't be too disappointed with losing their wickets. Northamptonshire started well, getting to 163 for 2 after all their top four got starts, but two wickets from England Test bowler Matthew Hoggard started to turn the match. From then on, the Northamptonshire effort just stopped dead, as they lost five wickets for 24 runs to fall to 216 for 9. Steffan Jones and Jason Brown paired up for 21 for the last wicket, but it was too little, too late. =Semi-Finals= Yorkshire never managed to score in the semi-final match at The Rose Bowl, which meant that Hampshire were set a relatively easy target of 198 to win. Michael Lumb top-scored with 43, but the late order failed to score runs quickly enough to get past 200; number ten John Blain only made six off 20 deliveries, while number nine Tim Bresnan made three off ten. Yorkshireman Deon Kruis served up some economical bowling early on to John Crawley, and bowled him for a 28-ball 8, but a 147-run partnership between Nic Pothas and Sean Ervine saw Hampshire right on track, as they won with over 10 overs to spare. Ervine made his second List A century, off 96 balls, but was caught and bowled by Richard Dawson three balls later. It didn't matter much - Hampshire only needed 20 runs to win, and Shane Watson and Nic Pothas knocked them off to book Hampshire's place in the C&G; Trophy final. (Cricinfo scorecard)  Warwickshire put in a fine bowling effort to send Lancashire out of the C&G; Trophy, despite Lancashire's Australian Marcus North taking three wickets. North's bowling - and others, Sajid Mahmood took two wickets - set Warwickshire back to 155 for 7, but Michael Powell and Trevor Frost put on an eighth-wicket partnership of 81 runs to carry Warwickshire to a total of 236 for 8 after 50 overs. Lancashire looked on track when Mal Loye and Stuart Law negotiated some tricky early bowling to put on 49 for the fourth wicket and see the score to 80 for 3, but medium pacer Jamie Anyon took two wickets, and a fiery spell from Neil Carter, which included two wickets to see him end with four for 26, had Lancashire bowled out for 137. (Cricinfo scorecard) =Final= *This was the first 50 overs-a- side English domestic final to be played with coloured clothing and white balls. Hampshire became the third team to win a major county trophy in 2005, as they prevailed in a high-scoring final at Lord's, leaving only the County Championship left for grabs. Nic Pothas and Sean Ervine added 136 runs for the second wicket to propel Hampshire to a big total against Warwickshire, whose bowlers gave away 20 runs from wides but still managed to bowl Hampshire out on the last ball. Ervine was fifth out, taking 91 balls for his second successive C&G; century, before he was caught off Jonathan Trott, who finished with three wickets for 35 runs. Neil Carter took five wickets to redeem his 66 conceded runs, while Makhaya Ntini bowled two maiden overs for Warwickshire, but went wicketless. Warwickshire were set to chase 291 to win, and Carter fulfilled his job as a pinch hitter well, scoring four fours and one six en route to 32, and Nick Knight and Ian Bell kept up with the required run rate well. However, Bell suffered cramps just before he reached 50, and that limited his movements - he succumbed shortly afterwards, chipping a simple catch to Chris Tremlett and was gone for 54. The other batsmen tried to add runs with Knight, but yielded to the Hampshire bowling and fielding effort, and when Knight was finally dismissed for 118 Warwickshire needed 40 runs for the last three wickets. Shane Watson effectively stopped that, having Dougie Brown and Ashley Giles out bowled, leaving Warwickshire to hit about 20 runs in the last over. It was too much for Makhaya Ntini, who was bowled by Chris Tremlett with the second ball of the last over, and thus Hampshire took an 18-run victory.

In 1965, as military governor of Saigon, he had successfully repressed Buddhist mobs instigated by Th√≠ch Tr√≠ Quang of the ·∫§n Quang group and Th√≠ch T√¢m Ch√¢u of Vi·ªát Nam Qu·ªëc T·ª±. With his commanding skills and knowledge, ƒê·ªïng was regarded highly by American and French officers, and well respected by many ARVN officers. A staunch nationalist and anti-communist, he was considered an ally to the labor union, the Northern Catholics, several Vi·ªát Nam Qu·ªëc D√¢n ƒê·∫£ng (Vi·ªát Qu·ªëc) factions, multiple ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát groups, Vi·ªát Nam C√°ch M·∫°ng ƒê·ªìng Minh H·ªôi (Vi·ªát C√°ch) high-ranking members, Duy D√¢n and H√≤a H·∫£o leaders. Early life and education Ph·∫°m VƒÉn ƒê·ªïng was born October 25, 1919, in Qu·ªëc Oai district, S∆°n T√¢y, Tonkin (now North Vietnam), when Vietnam was still part of French Indochina. He grew up in his father's village of Xu√¢n ƒê·ªó, Gia L√¢m district (then part of B·∫Øc Ninh Province) and went to school in H√† N·ªôi where he earned the \\"Th√†nh Chung\\" (Dipl√¥me d'Etudes Primaires Superieures Indochinoises (DEPSI)) upon his graduation from ƒê·ªó H·ªØu V·ªã School. Generations of ƒê·ªïng's family had taught at the Imperial Court. Ph·∫°m VƒÉn ƒê·ªïng himself had planned to become a teacher, so he enrolled at the √âcole Normale d'Instituteurs. In 1939, he had to withdraw, as he did not have the money to bribe a court official, even though he had passed the required examinations. He then joined the French colonial army at the persuasion of his father's friend. It was a good decision as ƒê·ªìng would later become one of the first Vietnamese officers to command French soldiers at the light division level (Groupement Mobile). ƒê·ªïng was also one of the few ARVN officers to have been officers in the French Army and the only general officer who had begun his military career as a private. Ref:External links News of his death- Career summary=World War II= Five years after joining the army as an enlisted man, he was promoted to Officer of Materials for the 2nd Battalion of the 19th Colonial Infantry Regiment (Officier du Mat√©riel, II/19e RMIC) stationed in M√≥ng C√°i. Here, he earned the trust of young N√πng, many of whom he later trained to be competent officers of the ARVN. On March 9, 1945, as part of their coup d'√©tat in French Indochina, Imperial Japanese Army forces in Tonkin attacked two battalions of the 19√®me RMIC at H√† C·ªëi. Two days later, the regiment commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Charles LeCocq, was killed in action while leading a counter-attack. His body would have been left behind were it not for the sharp-shooter Hoang Duc Phung who recovered it with ƒê·ªïng's mortar support. Two weeks later, ƒê·ªïng and remnants of the 1er Territoire Militaire fought their way to Qu·∫£ng T√¢y in South China where they joined General Marcel Alessandri who had been cooperating with the Chinese National Kuomintang Army (ÂúãÊ∞ëÈù©ÂëΩËªç) in the fight against Japanese armies. There, ƒê·ªïng attended a special officer class. During this period, he secretly made contacts with several Vi·ªát Qu·ªëc revolutionaries-in-exile most of whom would become his good friends and ardent supporters throughout his career in South Vietnam. At the end of 1945, Sous Lieutenant ƒê·ªïng returned to Vietnam where he was assigned to V·∫°n Hoa. =The First Indochina War= In 1946, ƒê·ªïng was transferred to the south where he participated in several major operations in G√≤ C√¥ng, Long Th√†nh, and Th√†nh Tuy H·∫°. A year later, his successes against communist troops earned him a promotion to Lieutenant. His abilities in organizing intelligence networks eventually landed him a position working for the Governor of North Vietnam, Nghi√™m Xu√¢n Thi·ªán as Sous-Directeur des Etudes (Ph√≥ S·ªü Nghi√™n C·ª©u) where he reported to Captain Sylvain Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn Minh. In 1949, Lieutenant ƒê·ªïng went back to the army as Chief of S-2 for the 2e BVN (Tr∆∞·ªüng Ph√≤ng 2 c·ªßa B·ªô ch·ªâ huy Tƒê2 VN). In 1950, the State of Vietnam's Minister of Defense Phan Huy Qu√°t, a ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát leader, asked ƒê·ªïng to join the Vietnamese National Army. A year later, after participating in the battle of Vƒ©nh Y√™n, he was appointed Commandant of the South Zone based in Nam ƒê·ªãnh. Early 1952, Captain ƒê·ªïng was appointed Commander of the 55th Vietnamese Battalion (55e BVN) stationed at the N√† S·∫£n fire-base. In late November, using 3 battle-hardened divisions (308th, 316th and 320th) General Giap attacked N√† S·∫£n with the intention of defeating the French Union forces to take control of northwest Tonkin. The 55e BVN fought valiantly against the enemy's relentless assaults. To put an end to the \\"human wave\\", ƒê·ªïng ordered his artillery- support to level and to fire howitzers loaded with fragmentation shells directly at the enemy troops. His decision saved the battalion and earned him a promotion to Major. By the end of the year, he took command of the 2e Groupe Mobile that participated in some of the hardest-fought battles to pacify the Red River Delta, especially in the Ninh B√¨nh area during Operation Hautes Alpes in March 1953. In September 1953, he was appointed Commander of the B√πi Chu Secteur and concurrently Commander of the Forces of North Vietnam Light Battalions and Artillery. The latter position was very important, for he was in command of nineteen light infantry battalions (TƒêKQ) and three artillery companies with the mission to pacify a military zone comprising seven provinces. Prior to taking command of B√πi Chu, ƒê·ªïng participated in Operation Tarentaise to take back areas under the Vi·ªát Minh's control. In October 1953, he commanded Operation L√™ L·ª£i to attack enemy's strongholds in the area. The operation was successful, though the cost was high: one of ƒê·ªïng light battalions at Qu·∫ßn Ph∆∞∆°ng H·∫° was completely destroyed by the Vi·ªát Minh's more seasoned independent regiments. It was in B√πi Chu that ƒê·ªïng, a Buddhist, would become an ally of Bishop Ph·∫°m Ng·ªçc Chi, his diocese and Father Ho√†ng Qu·ª≥nh. In return, these Roman Catholics would become his staunch supporters in both North and South Vietnam. In mid-1954, he was sent to South Korea to attend a special military training. Coming back to Vietnam shortly after the Geneva Convention that had partitioned the country into two, ƒê·ªïng as Commander of the Qu·∫£ng Y√™n Military Academy redeployed the academy resources and its personnel southward during Operation Passage to Freedom. =Vietnam War=From 1954 to the end of the 1st Republic ƒê·ªïng had done well as a military man. He had been recognized as a capable tactician by his superiors who continuously promoted him in the first 14 years of his military career. From a humble beginning as a plain soldier in 1939, he had steadily climbed the military ladder to the position of Lieutenant Colonel at the end of the First Indochina War. After the partition of Vietnam into two countries, Head-of-State B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i brought his government south where power struggles among different groups would lead to a change in the country's political future. Early 1955, Prime Minister Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám consolidated his power over South Vietnam by forcing General Hinh to leave the country then by using the armed forces to defeat the B√¨nh Xuy√™n, H√≤a H·∫£o and Cao ƒê√†i forces. Then, in a rigged referendum on October 23, 1955, Di·ªám ousted B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i and founded the Republic. During this time, ƒê·ªïng was the Coastal Zone Commander (Li√™n Khu Duy√™n H·∫£i). After the referendum, Di·ªám celebrated his rise to power by promoting all senior officers. Even though he supported General Hinh, ƒê·ªïng was promoted to Colonel. He would remain in charge of the coastal zone until October 25, 1956 when President Di·ªám transferred him to S√¥ng Mao (B√¨nh Thu·∫≠n) to command the 3rd Field Division, a unit made up entirely of N√πng soldiers. Lieutenant Colonel ƒê·ªó M·∫≠u, ƒê·ªïng second-in-command who was Di·ªám's prot√©g√© and a C·∫ßn Lao party member, was promoted to replace him. Ironically, M·∫≠u later would betray Di·ªám in 1963. Colonel ƒê·ªïng attracted Di·ªám's attention by refusing to let C·∫ßn Lao's cadres conduct political training sessions for his troops. Moreover, he also befriended and sheltered remnants of the B√¨nh Xuy√™n and H√≤a H·∫£o's defeated forces. In March 1958, President Di·ªám seeing that the 3rd Field Division was loyal to none but Colonel ƒê·ªïng, transferred N√πng soldiers to other units within the Army. In 1959, some of the N√πng soldiers left the army to join Father Nguy·ªÖn L·∫°c Ho√°, a good friend of ƒê·ªïng and a fervent anti-communist priest at the newly formed Sea Swallows enclave in C√† Mau. ƒê·ªïng, who was self- taught in English, was sent to training at the United States Army Command and General Staff College in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. When ƒê·ªïng returned to Vietnam in 1959, he was appointed Deputy Commander of the III Corps. In this position, he was in charge of conducting campaigns against NVA and Viet Cong units within the Corps's territory. During this period, he was not killed as President Di·ªám had hoped. Instead, due to his bravery, ƒê·ªïng earned the loyalty of his new troops and the respect of many junior officers which caused Di·ªám to mistrust him even more. The Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh's family personally disliked the colonel because of his friendship with Western reporters who had been writing articles damaging to the country's cause and unity (such as Neil Sheehan, David Halberstam, Malcolm Browne, Fran√ßois Sully, Robert Shaplen, Peter Arnett, and Beverly Deepe). In December 1962, after an American general had advised Di·ªám to promote ƒê·ªïng to general and after hearing other American advisers praised the colonel for his commanding skills, the president demoted ƒê·ªïng to III Corps's Inspector General of Strategic Hamlets. In August 1963, Buddhist monks caused a political disturbance, commonly known as the Buddhist crisis. This turmoil led to the November 1st coup d'√©tat that toppled Di·ªám's government. Shortly before the coup, President Di·ªám had the colonel held at Camp L√™ VƒÉn Duy·ªát out of suspicion that the latter was preparing to launch a coup to topple the government. ƒê·ªïng was indeed one of the conspirators and his detention shifted the President's suspicion away from other senior officers, primarily General ƒê√¥n, head of a CIA-backed and funded group of plotters (CIA liaison officer Lucien Conein gave this group US$42,000). On November 2, General D∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn \\"Big\\" Minh, a Di·ªám's prot√©g√©, ordered his bodyguard Captain Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Nhung and Major D∆∞∆°ng Hi·∫øu Nghƒ©a to torture and to kill the brothers Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh. Most Vietnamese senior officers suspected that general Minh took US Ambassador Lodge's suggestion of eliminating the brothers \\"to prevent any colonel from bring them back to power\\". Several ARVN generals then assumed leadership of South Vietnam. Power struggles, some of which influenced by the monk Tr√≠ Quang, would lead to a period of instability in the whole country. Political stability only came in 1967 when Lieutenant General Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Thi·ªáu and Air Marshal Nguy·ªÖn Cao K·ª≥ were elected leaders of the 2nd Republic. The turbulent years (1964‚Äì1967) With the escalation of the Vietnam War and with the increased United States involvement, the role of the ARVN became more significant but was seen by the media in the West as insignificant. After the coup, Colonel ƒê·ªïng served briefly as 7th Infantry Division Commander, during which time he earned the alias \\"Tiger of the Delta\\" for his twelve successful operations against Viet Cong and NVA troops. Late December 1963, he was abruptly relieved command of the division and was sent to Taiwan as military attach√©. Returning from Taiwan in May 1964, he was promoted to Brigadier General by General Nguy·ªÖn Kh√°nh. Late October 1964, he was promoted to Major General. A month later on November 27, he was appointed military governor of Saigon (now Ho Chi Minh City) and concurrently as Special Capital Military District Commander (T∆∞ L·ªánh Bi·ªát Khu Th·ªß ƒë√¥). During this time, ƒê·ªïng formed and funded his own armed group made up almost entirely of N√πng soldiers. Being charged with keeping the capital safe in these troubled times, he had to deal with an enemy in South Vietnam, the Buddhist Struggle Movement led by two monks, Th√≠ch Tr√≠ Quang of the ·∫§n Quang group and Th√≠ch T√¢m Ch√¢u of Vi·ªát Nam Qu·ªëc T·ª± (VNQT). Both of these monks wanted to topple the government of Vietnam, or at least to render it ineffective. Prime Minister Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn H∆∞∆°ng, a Buddhist, took a firm stand against the movement to prevent the country from anarchy. During this turmoil, PM H∆∞∆°ng fully supported General ƒê·ªïng when the latter effectively handled Buddhist protests and street agitations. Arrests were limited but well chosen and almost of detainees were proven to be Communists agents within the ·∫§n Quang group. At one time, ƒê·ªïng deployed two battalions to disband a violent and armed mob from VNQT. T√¢m Ch√¢u stopped his anti-government activities after a meeting with General Nguy·ªÖn Kh√°nh, while Tr√≠ Quang continued to cause political unrest. Recent declassified CIA documents suggest that the Buddhist movement had been penetrated by Viet Cong agents. T√¢m Ch√¢u himself published a White Paper in 1993 accusing Tr√≠ Quang of being a power-hunger man manipulated by North Vietnam and of harboring Communist agents. A declassified French S√ªret√© report showed that Tr√≠ Quang joined the Indochinese Communist Party in 1949, a fact that former SRV Deputy Prime Minister T·ªë H·ªØu proudly confirmed in 2000. In January 1965, Tr√≠ Quang successfully pressured Head-of-State Nguy·ªÖn Kh√°nh into dismissing P.M. H∆∞∆°ng. A month later, Dr. Qu√°t, a devout Buddhist and former Minister of Defense, was chosen to form a new government. Even without H∆∞∆°ng to support his actions, the general did not hesitate in arresting communist agents, many of whom had disguised as monks in the Buddhist movement. His success in preventing Tr√≠ Quang from toppling the government led the Armed Forces Council (H·ªôi ƒê·ªìng Qu√¢n L·ª±c) to name the general U·ª∑ Vi√™n An-Ninh (Security Commissioner) in March, shortly after his friend Nguy·ªÖn Kh√°nh was forced to resign and to leave the country. Infuriated by the AFC's action, Tr√≠ Quang manipulated Qu√°t, Thi·ªáu and K·ª≥ into dismissing the general from his positions of military governor and Special Capital Military District Commander. A recent declassified CIA memo showed Thi·ªáu as the one who requested general \\"Little\\" Minh, the Chief of General Staff, to investigate ƒê·ªïng for protecting gambling operations, a claim that Minh disputed and refused to do as asked. The same memo showed Qu√°t wanting to dismiss the general for being a troublemaker and K·ª≥ claiming ƒê·ªïng as corrupted. All of their actions against the general came after Tr√≠ Quang's continuous accusation that ƒê·ªïng was pro Catholics and perhaps even pro Di·ªám. The monk cited the general's unexplained actions toward some of Di·ªám's people as evidences, such as: protecting L√™ VƒÉn \\"White\\" Th√°i (Dr. Tuy·∫øn's assistant), or defending Tr·∫ßn Qu·ªëc B·ª≠u (co-founder of the C·∫ßn Lao party) and M√£ Tuy√™n (Head of the Tri·ªÅu Ch√¢u Chinese in Saigon). For two years after the dismissal, ƒê·ªïng remained in politics. He stayed in touch with two friends who had been exiled by K·ª≥: Nguy·ªÖn Ch√°nh Thi who sided with the monks during the Buddhist Crisis in Central Vietnam and Nguy·ªÖn Kh√°nh who was too vocal against American intervention in Vietnamese affairs. During this period, he was sent to several special assignments abroad, most notably to Thailand where his friend and a former Di·ªám's supporter, general Th√°i Quang Ho√†ng was the Ambassador. In June 1967, K·ª≥ forced the general to retire. The retirement did not stop ƒê·ªïng from military and social affairs. He continued to keep in touch with ARVN general officers to learn of troops' morale and he mentored junior officers in tactics. He also continued to serve armed forces personnel by co-founding an association for ancient and current combatants, the Hi·ªáp H·ªôi Chi·∫øn Sƒ© T·ª± Do. He worked with Australian Brigadier Ted Serong on a defense plan for the country in case the USA decided to stop all military aid. Closer to home, he continued to train his private army of N√πng soldiers. From the height of a political career to exile From 1969 to 1974, General ƒê·ªïng served military personnel in a different capacity, Minister of War Veterans (equivalent to the US Secretary of Veterans Affairs). During this time, he worked with West Germany to get financial and medical support for disabled veterans. His relationship with German officials in Oberhausen resulted in military orphans or children of disabled veterans going there to further their education. Most of the students came from the seven ministry-sponsored Qu·ªëc Gia Nghƒ©a T·ª≠ schools. Minister ƒê·ªïng's personal ties with Australian, Taiwanese and South Korean officials benefited Vietnamese veterans. During his tenure, Australia, Taiwan and South Korea provided much needed funding and training to disabled veterans at vocational facilities. His friendship with an American adviser Shelby Robert and his wife Miriam benefited the ministry as well. In April 1973, the Robert and the Gettysburg Presbyterian Church donated several wheelchairs and provided funding to train a Vietnamese doctor from the ministry. Later that year, the minister traveled to the United States and several western European countries to ask for financial assistance. The trip yielded good results: several US colleges provided the ministry with funding for its prosthetics center. In particular, Ohio State University sent professors to train teachers and to teach QGNT's students in three special courses: typing, accounting and home economics. President Thi·ªáu, in power since 1967, was becoming a dictator. By 1974, he had had thousands opposition persons arrested, and had increased the number of executions. Mass protest demonstrations led by opposition leaders in Saigon caused Thi·ªáu to reorganize his cabinet in an attempt to quiet the opposition. He also used the occasion to get rid of potential threats to his power. Minister ƒê·ªïng, with his own private army and considered by Thi·ªáu as a potential threat, was dismissed from the cabinet in February 1974 and two months later imprisoned without trial on corruption charges. Government-run newspapers and television channels then launched a public humiliation campaign against the minister, accusing him of corruption and of plotting against the government. In June, a special committee acquitted the minister of all charges after hearing testimonies from the ministry's high-ranking staff. Still, ƒê·ªïng was only released in July after Tr·∫ßn Qu·ªëc B·ª≠u, head of the T·ªïng Li√™n ƒêo√†n Lao C√¥ng (Confederation of Vietnamese Labor, the equivalent of the American AFL-CIO), and Father Ho√†ng Qu·ª≥nh of the Northern Catholics pressured Thi·ªáu to do so. After his release, General ƒê·ªïng spent his time mentoring senior Army officers and advising civilian opposition leaders on tactics against President Thi·ªáu. The Communist invasion in 1975 cut short of his attempt to return to political power. During the Fall of Saigon, he and his family were able to escape on a US Air Force C130 that took them to Guam, and then onward to the United States where he was offered political asylum. Personal life In his spare time, ƒê·ªïng wrote poems to relax under the pen name of N√πng Kh√°nh L√¢m. In 1944 while he was stationed in M√≥ng C√°i, he wrote poems to court a N√πng woman, L√™ Th·ªã L√Ω (1919‚Äì1992). They got married and eventually had five children. After coming to the States and settling in Arlington County, Virginia, ƒê·ªïng would occasionally serve as a translator on special projects for the Defense Department before retiring in 1982 to take care of his wife who had suffered from a stroke. Two years after L√Ω died, ƒê·ªïng remarried to M·ªπ-Lan Tr·ªãnh, from whom he acquired three stepdaughters. In 1996, he and his new family moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania where he died of congestive heart failure on November 26, 2008. Major General Ph·∫°m VƒÉn ƒê·ªïng is survived by his second wife M·ªπ-Lan, five children, three stepchildren, nine grandchildren and three great- grandchildren. Awards and decorations General ƒê·ªïng earned the following personal Vietnamese and foreign decorations and awards (unit citations are not listed): =Vietnam military decorations= * T∆∞∆°ng Trung Long Tinh Huy-Ch∆∞∆°ng (Officier de l'Ordre du Dragon d'Annam ‚Äì Order of the Dragon of Annam, Officer class) * ƒê·ªá Tam ƒê·∫≥ng B·∫£o Qu·ªëc Hu√¢n-Ch∆∞∆°ng (Commander of the National Order) * Ch∆∞∆°ng M·ªπ B·ªôi Tinh ƒê·ªá Nh·∫•t h·∫°ng (Chuong My Merit medal, 1st class) * ƒê·ªá T·ª© ƒê·∫≥ng B·∫£o Qu·ªëc Hu√¢n-Ch∆∞∆°ng (Officer of the National Order) * L·ª•c Qu√¢n Hu√¢n- Ch∆∞∆°ng ƒê·ªá Nh·∫•t h·∫°ng (Army Distinguished Service Order, 1st class) * Anh D≈©ng B·ªôi Tinh (Cross of Gallantry, with 18 citations ‚Äì palms & gold stars) * Ph√°t Tri·ªÉn S·∫Øc T·ªôc B·ªôi Tinh ƒê·ªá Nh·∫•t h·∫°ng (Ethnic Development Service Medal, 1st class) =Foreign decorations and awards= * Republic of China Order of Blue Sky and White Sun with Grand Cordon (ÈùíÂ§©ÁôΩÊó•Âã≥Á´†) * Republic of China Order of Brilliant Star, 1st Class(‰∏ÄÁ≠âÊôØÊòüÂã≥Á´†) * France Chevalier de la L√©gion d'honneur * France Croix de guerre 1939-1945 avec palme de bronze (citation a l'ordre de l'Arm√©e) * France Croix de guerre des Th√©atres d'Op√©rations Ext√©rieures avec 2 palmes d'argent et 4 citations de bronze * France Croix du combattant volontaire * France M√©daille Coloniale avec Barrette Extr√™me-Orient * France M√©daille d'honneur pour Actes de Courage et de D√©vouement * France M√©daille Comm√©morative de la guerre 1939‚Äì1945 * France M√©daille comm√©morative de la campagne d'Indochine * France Chevalier de l'Ordre du m√©rite du Territoire Autonome Nung * France Croix d'officier de l'Ordre du M√©rite Civil de la F√©d√©ration T'ai * Republic of Korea Field Marshal Lord Eulji Cordon, ROK 2nd highest decoration Order of Military Merit (Î¨¥Í≥µÌõàÏû•: ÏùÑÏßÄ). * Republic of Korea Order of Service Merit, 2nd Class (Í∑ºÏ†ïÌõàÏû•: Ìô©Ï°∞) * Kingdom of Thailand Most Exalted Order of the White Elephant, Commander class (‡πí‡πì. ‡∏ï‡∏£‡∏¥‡∏ï‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏†‡∏£‡∏ì‡πå‡∏ä‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏á‡πÄ‡∏ú‡∏∑‡∏≠‡∏Å ‚Äì dtr√¨ dtaa pon ch√°ang-p√®uak) Quotes= Quotes by = * \\"Our (the Republic of Vietnam government's) failure even to try winning the active loyalty of the rural population would lead toward defeat\\" (to George Allen, a US Army intelligence analyst in May 1960) = Quotes about = * \\"... his military skills, exceptional leadership and effort have contributed to the success (of the 55th BVN) at N√† S·∫£n in 1952 ...\\" (Republic of Korea's Minister of Defense Son Won Il, August 1954) * \\" ... a professional soldier ... tough, combatwise ... long friendship ... two old comrades from widely divergent backgrounds pulled together by the drama of Indochina.\\" (Howard R.

Huong knows only Dong and likes him ...\\" (Ambassador Maxwell Taylor's telegram to U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk, December 23, 1964) References=Glossary= * 1964‚Äì67 = This period of political unrest caused by Communist-manipulated, CIA-backed monks was also known as the \\"time of the generals\\". During this time, senior officers often formed groups with their own armies either to stage a coup d'√©tat or to protect themselves from their rivals. Evidences can be seen in photographs or senior officers and their troops wearing non- regulated uniforms of various designs. * Arm√©e Nationale Vietnamienne (ANV) = Qu√¢n ƒë·ªôi Qu·ªëc gia Vi·ªát Nam (National Army of Vietnam) created in 1949 as the State of Vietnam's armed forces. * ARVN = Army of the Republic of Vietnam, often incorrectly used as a collective term to refer to all South Vietnamese armed forces. * B√¨nh Xuy√™n connection = General ƒê·ªïng's belief in sheltering nationalists-in-danger led to his friendship with several former members of the Bay Vien's B√¨nh Xuy√™n (officially part of the QDQGVN under Head-of-State B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i). Lieutenant L√™ Nh·ª±t Quang, one of his earlier aides-de-camp, was the son of a B√¨nh Xuy√™n member. * B√πi Chu Secteur = located in B√πi Chu province and heavily populated by Catholics, the secteur was one of the first French military territories returned to the ANV's control. * BVN = Bataillon Vietnamien. Officially formed in 1949 as part of the Army for the State of Vietnam, a typical battalion consisted of 829 men, armed with French weapons. Its officers could be either Vietnamese or French. BVNs were formed to replace French units. By 1954, there were 98 BVN's. * Bataillon L√©ger = Light Infantry Battalion or Ti·ªÉu-ƒëo√†n Khinh-qu√¢n, formed in 1953, consisted of 638 men, armed entirely with US weapons. Its officers were Vietnamese. TDKQs were formed to pacify territories. By July, 1954, there were 81 TDKQ's. * Corps = The Republic of Vietnam was divided into four tactical zones, each of which was a political as well as military jurisdiction. * Duy D√¢n = ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát Duy D√¢n (Great Viet Populism Party) founded in 1942 by Nguyen Huu Thanh, codename Ngoc Tho (White Jade Rabbit) or more commonly known as XYZ Thai Dich Ly Dong A. The party found its support among Northern Vietnamese intellectuals who saw Ly Dong A's Populism as one of the best Vietnamese political theories. A wrote many doctrines and one of his best work is Huyet Hoa (Blood Flower). In 1946, after a failed armed revolt to overthrow Ho Chi Minh's government, A and his lieutenants were arrested and executed in H√≤a B√¨nh. During the Vietnam War, Professor Nguy·ªÖn H·ªØu Ch·ªânh, one of Duy D√¢n's top theorists, was one of General ƒê·ªïng's political advisers. * ƒê·ªó H·ªØu V·ªã school = One of the few schools the colonial government allowed to open for Vietnamese students in Tonkin. It was named after the fifth son of ƒê·ªó H·ªØu Ph∆∞∆°ng, Ch·ª£ L·ªõn's honorary mayor. Captain V·ªã, crippled after his plane had crashed in a 1914 mission, rejoined his former unit the 1st Foreign Legion Regiment. On July 9, 1916, Captain V·ªã, commander of the regiment's 7th company, died while leading an attack on German troops near Chancelier. * Field Division = S∆∞-ƒëo√†n D√£ Chi·∫øn with 8,600 men was organized as a regular division for conventional warfare. * Groupe Mobile = Largest military unit in Indochina and equivalent to a brigade or a light infantry division, a GM had approximately 6,000 men. Besides the infantry troops, the unit had: 1 company of mortar and light artillery, 1 field battery battalion equipped with 105mm howitzers, 1 platoon of combat medics, 2 light armored companies and 2 amphibious forces. * GS-2 = A group of officers in the headquarters of a military unit (in ƒê·ªïng's case, a battalion) that provide their commanders with information for planning, coordinating, and supervising operations. In Military Staff Organization, \\"2\\" is the military intelligence group. * Human Wave = Chi·∫øn Thu·∫≠t Bi·ªÉn Ng∆∞·ªùi (\\"Sea of human\\" tactics) was a classic Communist offense used mostly by Chinese and Vietnamese from the 1940s to the 1980s. An assaulting force that outnumbered defending troops at least 4 to 1 stormed the position continuously, creating endless \\"waves of people\\". Heavy artillery pounding the position to rubble usually preceded the assault. * Li√™n Khu Duy√™n H·∫£i = Military territory comprising four coastal provinces: Ph√∫ Y√™n, Kh√°nh H√≤a, Ninh Thu·∫≠n and B√¨nh Thu·∫≠n * Light Infantry Division = S∆∞-ƒëo√†n Khinh Chi·∫øn with 5,245 men was organized to operate in difficult terrains. * N√† S·∫£n fire-support base = General Salan's brainchild against Gi√°p's forces assaulting the T'ai territory and Upper Laos. Located in a valley 20 km south of S∆°n La, the fortified fire-support base was a strategic point set up to cut off Viet Minh's troop movements and to defend northwest Tonkin. Na-San had an airstrip that could accommodate the Dakota airplanes, had 21 \\"rings\\" of outposts with a complicated trench system, enforced with barbed wires. Na-San had a defense force of 11 battalions (15,000 men) and 6 artillery batteries. In December 1952, Gi√°p's forces failed to capture Na-San after bloody battles that cost the Viet Minh close to 5,000 lives and 2,000 wounded prisoners. The French Union forces lost 2 battalions. In his autobiography, Salan credited the superior air-support for the French victory (\\"sans elle [l'aviation], Na San n'√©tait pas possible et je perdais la bataille du Nord-Ouest\\" ‚Äì \\"Without air-support, N√† S·∫£n would not be possible and I would've lost the Northwest battle\\"). * Ninh B√¨nh = A province south of the Red River Delta. During the First Indochina War, Ninh B√¨nh, a strategic position and the \\"rice basket of Tonkin\\", must be defended at all cost by the Franco-Vietnamese forces. * N√πng = North Vietnam's ethnic minority of mixed Chinese-T'ai-Vietnamese. They are Chinese-speaking but are classified separately from the urban ethnic Chinese or Hoa. Their language is Cantonese Chinese with some T'ai and Vietnamese vocabularies. Prior to the partition of Vietnam into two countries, the Nungs lived mainly in the northeast areas bordering China. They are known for being a fierce warrior race. For generations, they sided with the French colonial government in exchange for autonomy from the Vietnamese Imperial Court. During the Indochina and the Vietnam Wars, Nungs were on both sides of the conflicts. General Ph·∫°m VƒÉn ƒê·ªïng, a northern Vietnamese who had gained their respect, was considered as one of their own. ƒê·ªïng spoke the language fluently, accepted their customs and married a Nung from M√≥ng C√°i. The actual highest-ranking Nung in the ARVN was Major General Ch∆∞·ªõng Dz·∫ønh Quay, IV Corps Chief of Staff at the end of the war. On the communist side, Lieutenant General L√™ Quang ƒê·∫°o was the highest- ranking Nung known during the Indochina and Vietnam Wars. * Qu·∫£ng Y√™n Military Academy (NCO) = Established in 1953 as a military educational institution that prepared candidates for service in the State of Vietnam Army's non- commissioned officer corps. * Qu·ªëc Gia Nghƒ©a T·ª≠ = Ward of the Nation was a brainchild of Lieutenant Colonel Tr∆∞∆°ng Khu√™ Quan who modeled it after France's \\"Office des Pupilles de la Nation\\". This independent agency was formed in October 1963 to provide educational opportunities for war orphans and children of war invalids/disabled veterans. In 1967, the Ministry of War Veterans took over the agency but continued to let it run by an independent management committee. By the end of the Vietnam War, QGNT had seven schools and 4 dormitories with over 200 teachers and an administrative staff close to 300 persons (most of whom were military widows, war disabled veterans and family members of soldiers who had died during the war). * RMIC = R√©giment Mixte d'Infanterie Coloniale (Mixed Colonial Infantry Regiment) consisted of 4 battalions. * Territoire Militaire = Part of the Tonkin division that had 5 military territories, one of which was the 1er Territoire Militaire based in M√≥ng C√°i. * Vi·ªát C√°ch = Vi·ªát Nam C√°ch M·∫°ng ƒê·ªìng Minh H·ªôi (Vietnam Revolutionary Alliance Party) started out in Nanjing as a coalition force of Vietnamese revolutionaries living in China since the late 1930s. Its first governing body consisted of leaders from different parties. By 1944, infighting rendered Vi·ªát C√°ch ineffective and most members went back to their original parties. Those remained with the party rallied around Nguy·ªÖn H·∫£i Th·∫ßn. After World War II, party members led by Than and armed by Kuomintang returned to Vietnam where several of its leaders joined Ho Chi Minh's government. After Ho signed the modus vivendi allowing French troops to re- enter the country, Viet Minh attacked to eliminate all opposition groups (Viet Cach was one). Some of the surviving members went back to China while others remained behind to rally around B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i. During the Vietnam War, a Viet Cach leader of VNQDƒê's background T·∫° Nguy√™n H·ªëi was one of General ƒê·ªïng's political advisers. * Z√¥ne = The State of Vietnam was divided into several military zones. In the early years of the country when the central government was new and when French colonial officials were still involved Vietnam's affairs, commanders (commandants) ran their zones any way they wanted to, some to the point of being warlords. The zones in Tonkin were: Northwest Autonomy Zone, Zone North, Zone West, Zone South, Zone Hanoi, Zone Hai Phong and Coastal Zone. Zone South (Zone Sud), the largest and most important, consisted of 3 provinces (Nam ƒê·ªãnh, Th√°i B√¨nh and Ninh B√¨nh), Ph·ªß L√Ω capital town, 4 sectors and 2 quarters (north of south of S√¥ng ƒê√°y). =Bibliography=      External links News of his death:  General:         External Links on Medals: , Retrieved September 30, 2009 *, Retrieved November 8, 2009  * Army of the Republic of Vietnam generals 1919 births 2008 deaths Non-U.S. alumni of the Command and General Staff College South Vietnamese military personnel of the Vietnam War Vietnamese anti-communists Vietnamese emigrants to the United States 3 Pham Van Dong Recipients of the Gallantry Cross (Vietnam) Recipients of the Distinguished Service Order (Vietnam) Recipients of the Order of the Dragon of Annam Chevaliers of the L√©gion d'honneur Recipients of the Order of Blue Sky and White Sun Recipients of the Croix de Guerre 1939‚Äì1945 (France) Recipients of the Order of Military Merit (Korea) Recipients of the Croix de guerre des th√©√¢tres d'op√©rations ext√©rieures People of the First Indochina War People from Arlington County, Virginia Military personnel from Philadelphia Government ministers of Vietnam ","title":"Ph·∫°m VƒÉn ƒê·ªïng"},{"id":"23752846","text":"NIET may refer to: * Noida Institute of Engineering and Technology, an engineering college in Greater Noida * National Individual Events Tournament, a national forensic-speaking tournament in the United States See also * Niet, a punk rock and hardcore punk band from Ljubljana, Slovenia ","title":"NIET"},{"id":"23752849","text":"L'amore non ha fine (Love Has No End) is the posthumous album from Italian singer Valentina Giovagnini, containing previously unreleased material.

He was the starting quarterback for Fritz Crisler's University of Michigan football teams in 1941 and 1942. Crisler later called Ceithaml \\"the smartest player he ever taught.\\" Ceithaml was selected as the quarterback on the 1942 All-Big Ten Conference team, the captain of the 1942 All-American Blocking Team, and was the 19th player selected in the 1943 NFL Draft. He later served as an assistant football coach at Michigan and the University of Southern California. Early years Ceithaml was born in Chicago and raised on the city's South Side. He was an All-City quarterback two straight years for Lindbloom High School. University of Michigan In 1939 Ceithaml enrolled at the University of Michigan and joined the football team at the beginning of the Fritz Crisler era. He was 6-feet tall and weighed 184 pounds as a football player at Michigan. As a sophomore in 1940 Ceithaml was the backup quarterback to Forest Evashevski on a team the included All-American Tom Harmon. Ceithaml first saw substantial playing time in November 1940 leading the press to report: \\"George Ceithaml has ended Michigan's two-year search for a capable substitute for Forest Evashevski. Ceithaml, a 190-pound sophomore, turned in a fine performance calling signals and blocking for the Wolverines against Pennsylvania.\\" Ceithaml received the 1940 Meyer Morton Award, established by the University of Michigan's \\"M\\" Club to recognize the underclassman who shows the greatest development and most promise as a football player. During his junior and senior years in 1941 and 1942, Ceithaml started all 18 of Michigan's games and played on defense as well as offense. In 1941, he started all eight games for a Michigan team that went 6-1-1 and finished the season ranked No. 5 in the final Associated Press poll. As a senior in 1942, he started all ten games and was selected as the captain during a season in which the Wolverines finished with a record of 7-3 and were ranked No. 9 in the country in the final Associated Press poll. The 1942 team captained by Ceithaml has been called \\"Crisler's '42 Iron Men\\": > \\"What made the 1942 Michigan football season interesting was the great > spirit shown by a club that lacked bench strength. The Wolverines had to > play up to eight men both ways every Saturday, yet they finished with a 7-3 > record. Three years later Coach Fritz Crisler invented two platoon football > in a futile attempt to wear down the superior Blanchard-Davis Army team at > Yankee Stadium, and from that time on ironman football became a memory that > not too many of today's fans still remember. ... In the backfield George > Ceithaml at quarterback and Bob Wiese at fullback rarely took a breather.\\" The 1942 season opened with a game against a military team from the Great Lakes Naval Station that featured 13 All-Americans and several professional players. Despite being rated as 35-point underdogs, the Wolverines held the Great Lakes team scoreless and won 9-0. The 1942 season also featured the first match between Michigan and Notre Dame since 1909. Ceithaml led Michigan to a 33-20 win over the Fighting Irish and scored the Wolverines' first touchdown on a quarterback sneak. In a 1993 interview, Ceithaml recalled that the 1942 Notre Dame match was \\"more than just a game.\\"Kruk, Natural Enemies, p. 134. He recalled: \\"We were so revved, we could have played two more quarters. The coaches never had to say a word to get us jacked up. We're Michigan. And the personal pride -- the pride of beating Notre Dame -- was intense.\\"Kruk, Natural Enemies, p. 134 Ceithaml had the responsibility to call the plays in Crisler's complex single-wing offense, and Crisler later called Ceithaml \\"the smartest player he ever taught.\\" After the plays were called, the quarterback in Crisler's offense was mainly a blocker. Before a 1942 game between Michigan and Harvard, the Harvard Crimson wrote: \\"Directing the team is Captain and quarterback George Ceithaml, who is a canny play-caller and rugged blocker.\\" Ceithaml developed a reputation as a fierce, \\"granite- shouldered\\" blocker,(\\"Granite-shouldered George Ceithaml of Chicago, the team captain, is back to maintain his reputation as a fierce blocker.\\") and some of his most important contributions came as a blocker for fullback Bob Wiese and halfback Tom Kuzma. Football Hall of Famers Red Grange and Elmer Layden called Ceithaml \\"one of the best blockers, signal callers, and defensive players in Michigan history.\\" Ceithaml's final game for Michigan was the 1942 season finale, a 28-14 win over Iowa. After the game, Associated Press sports writer Paul Chandler credited Ceithaml for his play-calling and \\"clever\\" blending of reverses, laterals and forward passes. At the end of the 1942 season, Ceithaml was named as the first-team quarterback on the Associated Press All-Big Ten Conference team and the captain of Wirt Gammon's 1942 All-American Blocking Team. In January 1943, Ceithaml was a starter for the East All-Stars in the 1943 East-West Shrine Game. He intercepted three passes in the game and helped the East to a 13-12 win. Military service and post-war football Ceithaml was the 19th player selected in the 1943 NFL Draft, taken as the third round pick of the Brooklyn Dodgers. However, he joined the United States Navy after graduating in June 1943 rather than sign with the National Football League. (Despite being drafted by the Dodgers, \\"Ceithaml joins the navy after graduation in June.\\") Ceithaml reached the rank of lieutenant and participated in the January 1944 landing at Anzio Beach and the June 1944 D-Day landing at Normandy. After returning from military service, Ceithaml was employed by the Ford Motor Company. In 1946, Ceithaml was chosen to play for the holdover College All-Star team in an annual match against the NFL champions. Ceithaml was reunited with former Michigan teammate Tom Harmon on a College All-Star team that defeated the NFL champion Rams by a score of 16-0. Ceithaml intercepted a pass off Kenny Washington in the fourth quarter of the game to stop a late drive by the Rams. In August 1946, the Detroit Lions engaged in a trade with the Boston Yanks to obtain the right to sign Ceithaml, but Ceithaml opted not to play professional football. Coach at Michigan In March 1947 Fritz Crisler hired Ceithaml to return to the University of Michigan as an assistant coach. He was initially assigned as the coach of the junior varsity squad, but was promoted to the position of backfield coach. Ceithaml was an assistant coach on Michigan's 1947 and 1948 championship football teams that compiled a two-year record of 19-0 and outscored opponents by a combined two- season total of 646-97. In 1949, the University of Michigan yearbook credited Ceithaml as being \\"the man behind the famous Michigan single-wing attack.\\" Ceithaml continued to serve as an assistant football coach at Michigan through the 1952 season. While staying in Southern California for the 1948 Rose Bowl between Michigan and USC, Ceithaml met Joan Kalmbach, a graduate of Pasadena City College and former Rose Bowl queen semifinalist. Kalmbach, an ardent USC fan, was working for Los Angeles radio station KXLA, and the two became acquainted on a pre-Rose Bowl trip to Catalina Island. Ceithaml proposed to Kalmbach on New Year's Eve‚Äîthe night before Michigan beat USC 49-0 in the Rose Bowl. The couple were married in Ann Arbor in April 1948, four months after they met. Coach at USC In 1953 Ceithaml moved with his wife and son, George W. Ceithaml, to Los Angeles after accepting a position as the backfield coach for the USC Trojans. Having lost badly to Michigan's single-wing offense in 1948, USC head coach Jess Hill told reporters, \\"We had to have a man who knew the single wing.\\" Hill checked with Crisler, and Crisler recommended Ceithaml. Based on the recommendation, Hill hired Ceithaml \\"sight unseen.\\" The Los Angeles Times expressed their hope that Ceithaml would teach USC's backs Michigan's \\"fullback spinner\\" and other \\"hocus pocus\\" plays. Ceithaml served as USC's backfield coach from 1953 to 1956. In January 1956 San Diego State University sought to lure Ceithaml away from USC by offering him a head coaching position and faculty status. Ceithaml opted to remain at USC for the 1956 season. In February 1957 Don Clark was hired as USC's new head coach; and one week later, Ceithaml announced his retirement from the coaching profession. He told the press at the time, \\"I intend to retire from coaching and seek an opportunity in another field.\\" Hall of Fame football coach George Allen credited Ceithaml as one of his influences in his book, \\"How To Scout Football.\\" Later years In April 1957 Ceithaml was hired as the divisional manager in the Pasadena area for Investors Diversified Services, Inc., then the world's largest investment management firm. By 1971, he was the company's regional vice president and shortly thereafter moved to the company's headquarters in Minnesota to become the company's senior vice president for marketing. Ceithaml retired in 1983 and moved back to California with his wife Joan. He died on May 24, 2012, at the age of 91 in Dana Point, California.

After conquering the Achaemenid Empire of Persia, the Macedonian king (and now the great king of the Persian Empire), Alexander, launched a campaign into the Indian subcontinent in present-day Pakistan, part of which formed the easternmost territories of the Achaemenid Empire following the Achaemenid conquest of the Indus Valley (late 6th century BC). After gaining control of the former Achaemenid satrapy of Gandhara, including the city of Taxila, Alexander advanced into Punjab, where he engaged in battle against the regional king Porus, whom Alexander defeated in the Battle of the Hydaspes in 326 BC,Fuller, pg 198 The Anabasis of Alexander/Book V/Chapter XVIII but he was so impressed by the demeanor with which the king carried himself that he allowed Porus to continue governing his own kingdom as a satrap.The Anabasis of Alexander/Book V/Chapter XIX Although victorious, the Battle of the Hydaspes was possibly also the most costly battle fought by the Macedonians.Peter Connolly. Greece and Rome At War. Macdonald Phoebus Ltd, 1981, p. 66 Alexander's march east put him in confrontation with the Nanda Empire of Magadha. According to the Greek sources, the Nanda army was supposedly five times larger than the Macedonian army. His army, exhausted, homesick, and anxious by the prospects of having to further face large Indian armies throughout the Indo-Gangetic Plain, mutinied at the Hyphasis (modern Beas River) and refused to march further east. Alexander, after a meeting with his officer, Coenus, and after hearing about the lament of his soldiers,The Anabasis of Alexander by Arrian, Book VI, Chapter XXVII - The Answer of Coenus eventually relented,The Anabasis of Alexander by Arrian, Book VI, Chapter XXVIII - Alexander Resolves to Return being convinced that it was better to return. This caused Alexander to turn south, advancing through southern Punjab and Sindh, along the way conquering more tribes along the lower Indus River, before finally turning westward.The Anabasis of Alexander/Book V/Chapter XXVIII Alexander died in Babylon on 10 or 11 June 323 BC. In , one year after Alexander's death, Chandragupta Maurya of Magadha founded the Maurya Empire in India.  Background = Sources = Of those who accompanied Alexander to India, Aristobulus, Onesicritus, and Nearchus wrote about the Indian campaign. The only surviving contemporary account of Alexander's Indian campaign is a report of the voyage of the naval commander Nearchus, who was tasked with exploring the coast between the Indus River and the Persian Gulf. This report is preserved in Arrian's Anabasis (c. AD 150). Arrian provides a detailed account of Alexander's campaigns, based on the writings of Alexander's companions and courtiers. Arrian's account is supplemented by the writings of other authors, whose works are also based on the accounts of Alexander's companions: these authors include Diodorus (c. 21 BC), Strabo (c. AD 23), and Plutarch (c. AD 119). = Socio-political conditions in India = Alexander's incursion into India was limited to the Indus River basin area, which was divided among several small states. These states appear to have been based on dominance of particular tribes, as the Greek writers mention tribes such as the Malloi as well as kings whose name seem to be tribal designations (such as Porus of the Puru tribe). The Achaemenid Empire of Persia held suzerainty over the Indus valley in the previous decades, but there was no trace of Achaemenid rule beyond the Indus river when Alexander's army arrived in the region. Strabo, sourcing his information from the earlier writer Eratosthenes, states that the Achaemenid king controlled the area to the west of the Indus. This area (including the Kapisa-Gandhara region) was probably the territory of the Indians, who according to the Greek accounts, fought alongside their overlord Darius III at the Battle of Gaugamela. Greek writings as well archaeological excavations indicate the existence of an urban economy dependent on agriculture and trade in the Indus basin. The Greeks mention the existence of cities and fortified towns such as Taxila. Arrian mentions that after defeating Porus, Alexander marched eastwards towards the Chenab River, and captured 37 towns: the smallest of these towns had 5,000 or more inhabitants. In the Swat valley, Alexander is said to have seized 230,000 oxen (possibly Zebu), intending to send them to Macedonia for ploughing land. Aristobulus saw rice being grown in paddy fields, Onesicritus reported the existence of a crop called bosmoran (possibly the pearl millet), and Nearchus wrote of \\"honey-yielding reeds\\" (presumably the sugarcane). Nearchus also mentions that Indians wore clothes made of cotton. Rock salt was extracted from the Salt Range, and supplied to other parts of India. Some primitive communities existed in the forest, desert, and coastal regions of the subcontinent. For example, Nearchus mentions that people around the Tomeros river (Hingol) subsisted on fishing, and used stone tools instead of iron ones. The Greek writers mention the priestly class of Brahmanas (as \\"Brachmanes\\"), who are described as teachers of Indian philosophy. They do not refer to the existence of any religious temples or idols in India, although such references commonly occur in their descriptions of Alexander's campaigns in Egypt, Mesopotamia and Iran. Greek accounts mention naked ascetics called gymnosophists. A philosopher named Calanus (probably a Greek transcription of the Indian name \\"Kalyana\\") accompanied Alexander to Persepolis, where he committed suicide on a public funeral pyre: he was probably a Jain or an Ajivika monk. Curiously, there is no reference to Buddhism in the Greek accounts. Other than their mention of the Brahmanas, the Greek narratives about Alexander's invasion do not directly mention the caste system. Some Brahmanas acted as advisors to local princes: Alexander had groups of Brahmanas hanged in present-day Sindh for instigating the rulers Musicanus and Sambus to revolt against him. The Greek writings attest the existence of slavery in at least two places: Onesicritus describes slavery in the territory ruled by Musicanus, and Aristobulus mentions poor people selling their daughters publicly in Taxila. Aristobulus also observed Sati, the practice of widows immolating themselves on their husbands' pyre, at Taxila. The practice of exposing dead bodies to vultures, similar to the Magian practice of Tower of Silence, was also prevalent in Taxila. Nearchus mentions that Indians wrote letters on closely woven cloth; it is possible that this is a reference to a precursor of the Kharoshthi script, which may have developed from the Aramaic alphabet during the Achaemenid rule. While describing a tribe on the coast of present-day Balochistan, Nearchus mentions that they were different from Indians in \\"their language and customs\\", which implies that he associated a particular language with the Indians. This does not mean that the Indians spoke a single language: the language that Nearchus associated with India might have been a lingua franca used for official and commercial purposes. This lingua franca was most probably the Gandhari Prakrit, as the Greek names (e.g. \\"Taxila\\" and \\"Sandrokottus\\") for Indian people and places seem to be derived from this language (e.g. \\"Takhasila\\" and \\"Chandagutta\\") rather than Sanskrit (e.g. \\"Takshashila\\" and \\"Chandragupta\\"). Nearchus attests the existence of medical science in India: he mentions that when the Greek physicians failed to provide remedies for snake-bites to Alexander, the king gathered Indian healers who were also able to cure other diseases and painful conditions. The Greek accounts do not mention any other sciences of contemporary India. = Alexander's preparation = Ancient Indian warriors (from left to right: Sattagydian, Gandharan, Hindush) circa 480 BC. Naqsh-e Rostam reliefs of Xerxes I. After the death of Spitamenes and his marriage to Roxana (Raoxshna in Old Iranian) in 326BC to cement his relations with his new Central Asian satrapies, Alexander was finally free to turn his attention to India. For Alexander, the invasion of India was a natural consequence of his subjugation of the Achaemenid Empire, as the areas of the Indus valley had long been under Achaemenid control, since the Achaemenid conquest of the Indus Valley circa 515 BC.The Achaemenid Empire in South Asia and Recent Excavations in Akra in Northwest Pakistan Peter Magee, Cameron Petrie, Robert Knox, Farid Khan, Ken Thomas p.714 Alexander was only taking possession of territories which he had obtained from the Achaemenids, and now considered rightfully his own. Alexander invited all the chieftains of the former satrapy of Gandhara, to come to him and submit to his authority. Ambhi (Greek: Omphis), ruler of Taxila, whose kingdom extended from the Indus to the Jhelum (Greek: Hydaspes), complied. At the end of the spring of 327 BC, Alexander started on his Indian expedition leaving Amyntas behind with 3,500 horse and 10,000 foot soldiers to hold the land of the Bactrians. Cophen Campaign Alexander personally took command of the shield-bearing guards, foot-companions, archers, Agrianians, and horse-javelin-men and led them against the clansthe Aspasioi of Kunar valleys, the Guraeans of the Guraeus (Panjkora) valley, and the Assakenoi of the Swat and Buner valleys. Alexander faced resistance from Hastin (or Astes), chief of the Ilastinayana (called the Astakenoi or Astanenoi) tribe, whose capital was Pushkalavati or Peukelaotis. He later defeated Asvayanas and Asvakayanas and captured their 40,000 men and 230,000 oxen. Asvakayanas of Massaga fought him under the command of their queen, Cleophis, with an army of 30,000 cavalry, 38,000 infantry, 30 elephants, and 7,000 mercenaries. Other regions that fought Alexander were Abhisara, Aornos, Bazira, and Ora or Dyrta. A fierce contest ensued with the Aspasioi, in the course of which Alexander himself was wounded in the shoulder by a dart, but eventually the Aspasioi lost the fight; 40,000 of them were enslaved. The Assakenoi faced Alexander with an army of 30,000 cavalry, 38,000 infantry, and 30 elephants. They had fought bravely and offered stubborn resistance to the invader in many of their strongholds such as the cities of Ora, Bazira, and Massaga. The fort of Massaga could only be reduced after several days of bloody fighting in which Alexander himself was wounded seriously in the ankle. When the Chieftain of Massaga fell in the battle, the supreme command of the army went to his old mother, Cleophis, who also stood determined to defend her motherland to the last extremity. The example of Cleophis assuming the supreme command of the military also brought the entire population of women of the locality into the fighting. Alexander was only able to reduce Massaga by resorting to political strategem and actions of betrayal. According to Curtius: \\"Not only did Alexander slaughter the entire population of Massaga, but also did he reduce its buildings to rubbles\\".Curtius in McCrindle, p. 192, J. W. McCrindle; History of Punjab, Vol I, 1997, p 229, Punjabi University, Patiala (editors): Fauja Singh, L. M. Joshi; Kambojas Through the Ages, 2005, p. 134, Kirpal Singh. A similar slaughter then followed at Ora, another stronghold of the Assakenoi. =Siege of Aornos= The Aornos is located to the north of Taxila, Pakistan. In the aftermath of general slaughter and arson committed by Alexander at Massaga and Ora, numerous Assakenians fled to a high fortress called Aornos (not definitely identified but somewhere between Shangla, in Swat, and the Kohistan region, both in northern Pakistan). Alexander followed close behind their heels and besieged the strategic hill-fort. The Siege of Aornos was Alexander's last siege, \\"the climax to Alexander's career as the greatest besieger in history\\", according to Robin Lane Fox. The siege took place in April 326BC. It presented the last threat to Alexander's supply line, which stretched, dangerously vulnerable, over the Hindu Kush back to Balkh, though Arrian credits Alexander's heroic desire to outdo his kinsman Heracles, who allegedly had proved unable to take the place Pir-Sar, which the Greeks called Aornis. The site lies north of Attock in what is now the Punjab, Pakistan, on a strongly reinforced mountain spur above the narrow gorges in a bend of the upper Indus. Neighboring tribesmen who surrendered to Alexander offered to lead him to the best point of access. At the vulnerable north side leading to the fort, Alexander and his catapults were stopped by a deep ravine. To bring the siege engines within reach, an earthwork mound was constructed to bridge the ravine. A low hill connected to the nearest tip of Pir-Sar was soon within reach and taken. Alexander's troops were at first repelled by boulders rolled down from above. Three days of drumbeats marked the defenders' celebration of the initial repulse, followed by a surprise retreat. Hauling himself up the last rockface on a rope, Alexander cleared the summit, slaying some fugitivesinflated by Arrian to a massacreand erected altars to Athena Nike, Athena of Victory, traces of which were identified by Stein. Sisikottos, or Sa≈õigupta, who had helped Alexander in this campaign, was made the governor of Aornos. Punjab After reducing Aornos, Alexander crossed the Indus to begin campaigning in the Punjab region. =Battle of the Hydaspes River= A painting by Charles Le Brun depicting Alexander and Porus (Puru) during the Battle of the Hydaspes. The Battle of the Hydaspes River was fought by Alexander in July 326BC against king Porus (possibly, Paurava) on the Hydaspes River (Jhelum River) in the Punjab, near Bhera. The Hydaspes was the last major battle fought by Alexander.P.H.L. Eggermont, Alexander's campaign in Southern Punjab (1993). The main train went into what is now modern-day Pakistan through the Khyber Pass, but a smaller force under the personal command of Alexander went via the northern route, resulting in the Siege of Aornos along the way. In early spring of the next year, he combined his forces and allied with Taxiles (also Ambhi), the King of Taxila, against his neighbor, the King of Hydaspes. Porus awaits the attack of Alexander, July, 326 BC. Porus was a regional King in India. Arrian writes about Porus, in his own words: Porus drew up on the south bank of the Jhelum River, and was set to repel any crossings. The Jhelum River was deep and fast enough that any opposed crossing would probably doom the entire attacking force. Alexander knew that a direct crossing would fail, so he found a suitable crossing, about upstream of his camp. The name of the place is \\"Kadee\\". Alexander left his general Craterus behind with most of the army while he crossed the river upstream with a strong contingent. Porus sent a small cavalry and chariot force under his son to the crossing. According to sources, Alexander had already encountered Porus's son, so the two men were not strangers. Porus's son killed Alexander's horse with one blow, and Alexander fell to the ground. Also writing about this encounter, Arrian adds, \\"Victory coin\\" of Alexander the Great, minted in Babylon c.322 BC, following his campaigns in the Indian subcontinent. Obverse: Alexander being crowned by Nike. Reverse: Alexander attacking king Porus on his elephant. Silver. British Museum. The force was easily routed, and according to Arrian, Porus' son was killed. Porus now saw that the crossing force was larger than he had expected, and decided to face it with the bulk of his army. Porus's army were poised with cavalry on both flanks, the war elephants in front, and infantry behind the elephants. These war elephants presented an especially difficult situation for Alexander, as they scared the Macedonian horses. Alexander started the battle by sending horse archers to shower the Porus's left cavalry wing, and then used his cavalry to destroy Porus's cavalry. Meanwhile, the Macedonian phalanxes had crossed the river to engage the charge of the war elephants. The Macedonians eventually surrounded Porus's force. Diodorus wrote about the battle tactics of war elephants: The fighting style of Porus' soldiers was described in detail by Arrian: According to Curtius Quintus, Alexander towards the end of the day sent a few ambassadors to Porus: According to Plutarch this was one of Alexander's hardest battles: Plutarch also wrote that the bitter fighting of the Hydaspes made Alexander's men hesitant to continue on with the conquest of India, considering that they would potentially face far larger armies than those of Porus if they were to cross the Ganges River. Porus was one of many local kings who impressed Alexander. Wounded in his shoulder, standing over tall, but still on his feet, he was asked by Alexander how he wished to be treated. \\"Treat me, Alexander, the way a King treats another King\\", Porus responded. Other historians question the accuracy of this entire event, noting that Porus would never have said those words.Rogers, p.200 Philostratus the Elder in the Life of Apollonius of Tyana writes that in the army of Porus there was an elephant who had fought bravely against Alexander's army and Alexander dedicated it to Helios (Sun) and named it Ajax, because he thought that a so great animal deserved a great name. The elephant had gold rings around its tusks and an inscription was on them written in Greek: \\"Alexander the son of Zeus dedicates Ajax to Helios\\" (ŒëŒõŒïŒûŒëŒùŒîŒ°ŒüŒ£ Œü ŒîŒôŒüŒ£ Œ§ŒüŒù ŒëŒôŒëŒùŒ§Œë Œ§Œ©Œô ŒóŒõŒôŒ©Œô).Philostratus the Elder, Life of Apollonius of Tyana, ¬ß 2.12 Alexander did not continue, thus leaving all the headwaters of the Indus River unconquered. He later founded Alexandria Nikaia (Victory), located at the battle site, to commemorate his triumph. He also founded Alexandria Bucephalus on the opposite bank of the river in memory of his much-cherished horse, Bucephalus, who carried Alexander through the Indian subcontinent and died heroically during the Battle of Hydaspes. Musicanus Musicanus (Arrian, Anabasis of Alexander, 6.17, Indian: M√ªshika) was an Indian king at the head of the Indus, who raised a rebellion against Alexander the Great around 323 BC. Peithon, one of Alexander's generals, managed to put down the revolt: :\\"Meantime he was informed that Musicanus had revolted. He dispatched the viceroy, Peithon, son of Agenor, with a sufficient army against him, while he himself marched against the cities which had been put under the rule of Musicanus. Some of these he razed to the ground, reducing the inhabitants to slavery; and into others he introduced garrisons and fortified the citadels. After accomplishing this, he returned to the camp and fleet. By this time Musicanus had been captured by Peithon, who was bringing him to Alexander.\\" - Arrian AnabasisArrian Anabasis Book 6b Patala The King of Patala came to Alexander and surrendered. Alexander let him keep possession of his own dominions, with instructions to provide whatever was needed for the reception of the army.Arrian, Anabasis of Alexander, 6.17 Revolt of the army Asia in 323 BCE, the Nanda Empire and neighboring Gangaridai of Ancient India in relation to Alexander's Empire and neighbors. East of Porus's kingdom, near the Ganges River (the Hellenic version of the Indian name Ganga), was the powerful Nanda Empire of Magadha and the Gangaridai Empire of Bengal. Fearing the prospects of facing other powerful Indian armies and exhausted by years of campaigning, his army mutinied at the Hyphasis River (the modern Beas River), refusing to march further east. Alexander's troops beg to return home from India in plate3 of 11 by Antonio Tempesta of Florence, 1608. Chandraketugarh in West Bengal, India is believed to be the capital of Gangaridai. The Gangaridai army, with its 4,000 elephant force, may have led to Alexander's retreat from India. Alexander, using the incorrect maps of the Greeks, thought that the world ended a mere away, at the edge of India. He therefore spoke to his army and tried to persuade them to march further into India, but Coenus pleaded with him to change his mind and return, saying the men \\"longed to again see their parents, their wives and children, their homeland\\". Alexander, seeing the unwillingness of his men, agreed and turned back. Campaign against the Malli Along the way, his army conquered the Malli clans (in modern-day Multan). During a siege, Alexander jumped into the fortified city with only two of his bodyguards and was wounded seriously by a Mallian arrow. See also: His forces, believing their king dead, took the citadel and unleashed their fury on the Malli who had taken refuge within it, perpetrating a massacre, sparing no man, woman or child. However, due to the efforts of his surgeon, Kritodemos of Kos, Alexander survived the injury. Following this, the surviving Malli surrendered to Alexander's forces, and his beleaguered army moved on, conquering more Indian tribes along the way. Aftermath Ptolemy coin with Alexander wearing an elephant scalp, symbol of his conquests in southern Asia. The army crosses the Gedrosian Desert, by Andre Castaigne (1898-1899). Alexander sent much of his army to Carmania (modern southern Iran) with his general Craterus, and commissioned a fleet to explore the Persian Gulf shore under his admiral Nearchus while he led the rest of his forces back to Persia by the southern route through the Gedrosian Desert (now part of southern Iran) and Makran (now part of Pakistan). In crossing the desert, Alexander's army took enormous casualties from hunger and thirst, but fought no human enemy. They encountered the \\"Fish Eaters\\", or Ichthyophagi, primitive people who lived on the Makran coast of the Arabian Sea, who had matted hair, no fire, no metal, no clothes, lived in huts made of whale bones, and ate raw seafood obtained by beachcombing. During the crossing, Alexander refused as much water as possible, to share the sufferings of his men. In the territory of the Indus, Alexander nominated his officer Peithon as a satrap, a position he would hold for the next ten years until 316BC, and in the Punjab he left Eudemus in charge of the army, at the side of the satrap Porus and Taxiles. Eudemus became ruler of a part of the Punjab after their death. Both rulers returned to the West in 316BC with their armies.

The Club has occupied the same building at 19 Old Broad Street, near Tower 42 and Liverpool Street station, since its foundation, although it initially occupied it on a leasehold basis, with freehold being acquired in 1889.

Further, it allows users to record trip data and share it via the web, including interfaces with Facebook and Twitter. Trapster was recognized by Time Magazine as one of the 10 Best iPhone Apps for Dads in June 2009. In addition, Wired listed Trapster as the number 1 application in their 10 Mobile Applications that Make the Most of Location and CNET named Trapster as their number 1 free iPhone automotive app. Trapster's mobile GPS app supported the operating systems Android, iOS, BlackBerry OS, Windows Mobile, webOS, S60, and unlocked Java ME phones with GPS. In addition to these mobile phones, Trapster had support for both Garmin and TomTom navigation units.  Features  Trapster can use Wi-Fi or GPS to pinpoint the user's current location and send them audio alerts or text messages when they are approaching a ticket threat. Users report the existence of a trap by pressing the touch screen or using a key combination on the mobile device. To negate the effect of pranksters or the police entering bogus locations, users can verify the locations of existing traps in the same manner. Trapster gives greater weight to traps that are rated more reliably. Users can customize the alerts via the Trapster website or the mobile app so that they only receive notifications of conditions they are interested in, such as red light cameras or live police. Information about static traps, such as red light cameras and speed cameras, stays in Trapster's database indefinitely. Live speed trap locations are kept in the system for one hour, as it is likely that the officers will move on to a new location.  History  Pete Tenereillo launched Trapster, the modern equivalent of headlight flashing, where motorists warn other motorists of police speed traps, in November 2007, and by early 2009, had 1/2 a million users signed up. On July 20, 2009, Trapster had signed up its 1 millionth user. Less than a year later, the company claimed to have in excess of 4 million users. As of October 2012, the company had over 17 million users, and peaked at 22 million users before being shut down in 2014. Law enforcement officials have differing reactions to Trapster, although it is thought to be legal in all 50 US states, and in most countries worldwide. Washington D.C. police chief Cathy Lanier denounced the technology as a 'cowardly tactic' and said that \\"It's designed to circumvent law enforcement ‚Äî law enforcement that is designed specifically to save lives.\\" Later, a D.C. police spokesperson said that Lanier was misquoted and that the department has no opinion on the matter. Bill Johnson, executive director of the National Association of Police Organizations stated that he is all for it if the result is that people slow down. \\"If someone slows down because of it\\", he said, \\"it's accomplishing the same goal of trying to get people to obey the speed limit.\\" Additionally, Sgt. Brent Barbee of the Amarillo, Texas Police Department said \\"Having (motorists) slow down on their own is a lot less manpower-intensive than having us forced to spend time writing tickets. Whether they slow down because their friend told them to slow down (by using Trapster) or a ticket, the net effect is the same: They've slowed down.\\" Pete Tenereillo sold Trapster to the NAVTEQ division of Nokia in 2010 and is no longer involved with the company. In January, 2011, Trapster's servers were apparently hacked, and the user database of more than 10 million email passwords were possibly revealed. On December 1, 2014, Trapster announced that it is shutting down its services at the end of 2014. When checked on December 21, 2014, it was discovered the Trapster website was put into closure mode, thereby cutting off new activations, and the Twitter account permanently closed. Pete Tenereillo re-acquired the assets of Trapster in late 2017.

It was produced by Harley and Jimmy Horowitz. Background Having spent almost a year living in Los Angeles, during which time his debut solo album Hobo with a Grin was released, Harley returned to London at the end of 1978. In mid-November 1978, various UK music magazines reported that after returning to England at Christmas, Harley would form a new band, record a new album in February and plan a world tour for later in the year. Speaking to the Daily Star in December 1978, he described Hobo with a Grin as \\"an experience\\", adding: \\"But this time I'll do things very differently. I'll get the band together, then record the album in a fortnight - the way I always used to.\\" The Candidate took three weeks to write, while recording took place during February at Abbey Road Studios. The entire album was also mixed and mastered at Abbey Road Studios, except mixing for \\"Freedom's Prisoner\\", which took place at Morgan Studios. Afterwards, Harley began planning a British and European tour for later in the year. When talking of forming a new Cockney Rebel line-up, Harley commented to Daily Mirror's Pauline McLeod: \\"There will undoubtedly be some of the old group members of the group in the line-up. Maybe Jim Cregan could join up for it if he's not busy recording with Rod Stewart.\\" Speaking to Maggi Russell in early 1979, Harley revealed of the new album: In an interview with The Evening News in October, Harley spoke of his return from America and the album's creation: In May 1979, Harley appeared with Peter Gabriel at one of Kate Bush's Hammersmith Odeon concerts in May 1979. It was Harley's first performance on stage in two years. Later in August, New Musical Express announced that Harley was currently bringing a touring band together and was in the middle of planning a British tour to follow the release of his new album. In September, EMI released The Candidate, along with the single \\"Freedom's Prisoner\\". Despite predictions, The Candidate was a commercial failure, although \\"Freedom's Prisoner\\" did reach #58 in the UK Top 75 during October.http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/18068/steve-harley/ By this time, plans for a British tour were scrapped. Instead, Harley performed a one-off, sold-out show at the Hammersmith Odeon in London in October, with a new line- up of Cockney Rebel as his backing band. Comparing The Candidate with Hobo with a Grin, Harley commented in his interview with The Evening News: \\"I looked at that LP the other day ‚Äì looking is enough. I can't bear to listen to it. It's the worst thing I've ever done. I'm getting the old Cockney Rebel band together for a concert in London at the end of this month. And there won't be one song from the Hobo with a Grin LP in the set. But The Candidate is a different story altogether. After hours of deliberation, I've left out two songs from it and I hated doing that. There isn't a bad song on it.\\" Following the disappointing sales of The Candidate, EMI dropped Harley from their label. The album was his last studio album until the release of 1992's Yes You Can. Release The album was released on vinyl by EMI Records in the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and Portugal. The album's sleeve featured photography by Mick Rock. The photographs displayed on the back side of the sleeve were taken showing Harley and co. during the recording sessions of the album. Later in 2000, the album received its first CD release through EMI and Harley's own Comeuppance Discs label. It contained two bonus tracks; the 1982 non-album single \\"I Can't Even Touch You\\" and a live version of the 1974 Cockney Rebel song \\"Psychomodo\\". On 6 October 2003, Voiceprint released the album on CD as a part of their \\"2 for One Series\\" along with Harley's 1992 album Yes You Can. On 31 October 2011, The Candidate was digitally remastered and released on CD by BGO Records as a double album set with Hobo with a Grin. Promotion In the 20 October 1979 issue of Melody Maker, a full-page, black-and-white advert was published to promote the album's release, as well as the \\"Freedom's Prisoner\\" single. A music video was also filmed to promote the single. Critical reception Upon release, Red Starr of Smash Hits commented: \\"Harley's never fully developed talents have scraped rock bottom in recent years. Side one here is back to his stylish, tuneful, Cockney Rebel best, but side two is simply pedestrian Americanised blandness that provokes only weariness. A mixed up album from a mixed up man but all credit for returning to the fray.\\" He considered \\"Audience with the Man\\" and \\"Freedom's Prisoner\\" to be the album's best tracks. Mike Nicholls of Record Mirror praised the album in comparison to the \\"poor\\" Hobo with a Grin. He commented: \\"The Candidate shows Harley once again writing interesting and intelligent songs in a musical setting both contemporary and proficient. The honesty and unpretentious ingenuity of The Candidate should re-establish [him] as an artist working independently of current trends with a style and craftsmanship that easily transcends this or any other year's models.\\" Aberdeen Press and Journal stated: \\"The Candidate finds Harley in fine form, vitriolic as ever.\\"Aberdeen Press and Journal - 17 November 1979 - page 11 Aberdeen Evening Express noted: \\"Steve's back with an album which puts him more in a conformist category rather than a (Cockney) rebel. But it's great all the same. Funny how he always manages to come up with at least three brilliant tracks on each album. This time it's \\"Audience with the Man\\", \\"Freedom's Prisoner\\" and \\"How Good It Feels\\". His lyrics and eloquent singing are still very much the Harley of old.\\"Aberdeen Evening Express - Review - 5 December 1979 - page 13 Dave Thompson of AllMusic retrospectively wrote: \\"When \\"Freedom's Prisoner\\" hit the airwaves in fall 1979, it would have taken a lot to convince the longtime fan that the man hadn't resparked all his old glories again. It was Harley's finest 45 in half a decade. It was also a total fluke, as the accompanying album flopped onto the streets and proved itself to be little more than a clutch of substandard songs, glued together by alluring production alone. \\"Audience with the Man\\" and \\"From Here to Eternity\\" do bear repeated listens, but too much of The Candidate clung so lifelessly to the stylus that it was hard to believe our hopes had ever soared so high.\\" Of the 2000 re-issue of the album, Q commented: \\"Despite Harley returning to Blighty, the splendid The Candidate sold so poorly that EMI dumped what four years previously had been their major act. \\"Freedom's Prisoner\\" deserved to be an enormous hit, \\"Woodchopper\\" rhymes 'editorial' with 'accusatorial', and the soul-baring \\"One More Time\\" ruminates lasciviously on being taken from behind the leopardesses. Time surely for a little readjustment of history.\\"Q Magazine, September 2000, p.124 Of the 2011 BGO double CD release of the album with Hobo with a Grin, Terry Staunton of Record Collector stated: \\"Harley's opening brace of releases not to feature the Cockney Rebel name took him ever further away from the glam/art rock of his chart past. Hobo with a Grin takes stabs at anything and everything. The following year's offering draws from just as big a notice board, but the musical thumbtacks are rarely strong enough to hold the ideas in place. \\"Audience with the Man\\" and \\"From Here to Eternity\\" suggest a love for early Springsteen, but with little of Bruce's energy or articulacy, \\"How Good It Feels\\" is passable Brit country, while \\"Freedom's Prisoners\\" sounds like synth-rock played by jet-lagged Cossacks.\\" Track listingPersonnel * Steve Harley ‚Äì vocals, producer * Jo Partridge ‚Äì guitar * Nico Ramsden ‚Äì guitar, backing vocals * Phil Palmer ‚Äì guitar * Joey Carbone ‚Äì keyboards, backing vocals * Steve Gregory ‚Äì saxophone, saxophone arrangement * John Giblin ‚Äì bass * Stuart Elliott ‚Äì drums * Bryn Haworth ‚Äì mandolin (track 1) * The English Chorale ‚Äì choir (track 3) * Robert Howes ‚Äì choir director (track 3) * Yvonne Keeley ‚Äì backing vocals * Jimmy Horowitz ‚Äì producer (all tracks), celesta (track 2) * Mike Hedges ‚Äì mixing (track 3) * Tony Clark ‚Äì engineer (all tracks) * Haydn Bendall ‚Äì assistant engineer (all tracks) * Chris Blair ‚Äì mastering * Graham Marks ‚Äì design (front cover lettering) * Mick Rock ‚Äì front/back cover photography, design for TRA Studios Inc., art direction for TRA Studios Inc. * Ernie Thormahlen ‚Äì design for TRA Studios Inc., art direction for TRA Studios Inc. * Richard Young ‚Äì inner sleeve photography * Billyee ‚Äì design (inner sleeve and album back jacket graphic and design) for Bine Graphic Designs Inc. * Neal Kandel ‚Äì design (inner sleeve and album back jacket graphic and design) for Bine Graphic Designs Inc.

In 1902, during Cecil Rhodes' funeral procession in Cape Town, his coffin was carried on top of the Long Cecil carriage. Today the gun is located on the stylobate (facing the Free State) of the Honoured Dead Memorial in Kimberley. At some time before 1915 Pratt & Whitney built a model of this gun as a gift to the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.  Construction  The defenders at Kimberley had only the relatively small RML 2.5 inch Mountain Gun at their disposal and therefore lacked a weapon that could effectively match those fielded by the surrounding Boers. Barrel and breech blueprints Labram and Edward Goffe, Chief Draughtsman at the mine, reviewed the limited number of textbooks and publications on gunmaking that were available in Kimberley. From this and calculations on what it would require to build a gun capable of firing a shell over , they decided that it was feasible to build the gun with the materials at hand. Construction of the gun began on 26 December 1899 with rough-turning of the barrel, but some of the tools required for rifling the barrel were not available and first had to be manufactured on site. The barrel was constructed from a , billet of mild steel. The steel billet was originally ordered as a shaft for one of the De Beers workshop machines.  Impact on the siege  Long Cecil Ammunition As with all the components, custom ammunition for the gun had to be manufactured in the De Beers workshops. The first proving shot was fired a little over three weeks later on 19 January 1900 at a Boer encampment near Kamfers Dam, north of the city. Contemporary accounts state that the Boers were initially surprised by range of the new gun, which was able to land projectiles very accurately on their previously safe position. The gun fired a total of 255 shells onto Boer positions from the time of its manufacture until the end of the siege about a month later. The gun did not change the balance of power for long, because the Boers brought a larger 100-pound \\"Long Tom\\" gun to bear within two weeks of Long Cecil's deployment. The shelling of the besieged residents thereby escalated and soon became more lethal than before. The shelling ended only with arrival of Major- General French's 8,000-strong cavalry on 15 February 1900.

Story  Poisoned with Kryptonite and put on trial for causing as many disasters as he prevents, Superman must relive his past as his closest friends as allies try to save him from eternal imprisonment in the Phantom Zone. Prosecutor Lex Luthor (who is also running for Mayor of Metropolis) squares off against Superman's advocate, Lois Lane in front of acting judge, one of the Guardians of the Universe.

He played in the Football League with Southend United, before dropping into non-League football. Playing career Forbes started his career with Essex Senior League side Saffron Walden Town, before joining Southend United in 2000. He spent the pre-season on trial with Canvey Island before joining Southend. Forbes made his debut for Southend, replacing Scott Houghton as a substitute in the 73rd minute in a Third Division match against Brighton & Hove Albion in the 2‚Äì1 win on 12 August 2000 at Roots Hall. His first goal for Southend United was on 4 November, when they defeated Macclesfield Town 3‚Äì1 at home in the Third Division. Forbes scored in injury time with a shot from the edge of the penalty area. He made a total of 59 appearances, scoring four goals in all competitions for Southend over two seasons, after an injury ravaged season. Forbes struggled with injuries to his thigh, hamstring and ankle. \\"First I had trouble with my thigh, then it was my ankle, my hamstring and then my ankle again. It's just been one injury nightmare after another,\\" Forbes admitted. After being released at the end of the 2001‚Äì02 season, Forbes signed for Isthmian League Premier Division club Canvey Island in July 2002. He went out on loan to Bishop's Stortford, February 2002.

He re- signed for Heybridge Swifts on a permanent basis in October 2004, before leaving in April 2005 by mutual consent. Heybridge manager, Brian Statham explained Forbes' departure saying; \\"Scott felt that at times he was being unfairly criticised by the management and had not been given a fair crack of the whip.

Life The son of Thomas Marshall, he was born at Barkby in Leicestershire, and baptised there on 9 January 1621. He was educated first under Francis Foe, vicar of Barkby, matriculated at Oxford on 23 October 1640, as a batler of Lincoln College, and was Traps scholar from 31 July 1641 till 1648. Oxford was garrisoned for the king and Marshall served in the regiment of Henry Carey, 1st Earl of Dover, at his own expense, so that he was excused fees when graduating B.A. on 9 July 1645. On the approach of a parliamentary visitation in 1647, Marshall left the university and went abroad. On 14 July 1648 he was expelled for absence by the visitors. In Rotterdam he became preacher to the company of merchant adventurers in that city at the end of 1650. In 1656, when the merchants moved to Dort, he accompanied them and remained there for sixteen years. On 1 July 1661 he graduated B.D. at Oxford. Marshall was a student of Anglo-Saxon and Gothic. His Observations on Anglo- Saxon and Gothic versions of the gospel, which he published in 1665, led to his unsolicited election to a fellowship of Lincoln College on 17 December 1668. He proceeded D.D. on 28 June of the following year, and was chosen Rector of his college on 19 October 1672. Soon after he was made chaplain in ordinary to the king. He was rector of Bladon, near Woodstock, from May 1680 to February 1682, and was installed dean of Gloucester on 30 April 1681 In 1681 and 1684 he was one of the delegates for the chancellor of the university, James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde, who was absent in Ireland. Marshall died suddenly in Lincoln College, about 11 P.M., on Easter Eve, 18 April 1685, and was buried in the chancel of All Saints' Church, Oxford. A memorial stone in the floor, with a Latin inscription, marks the spot. He left the residue of his estate to Lincoln College, for the maintenance of poor scholars. 'Marshall's scholars ' were regularly elected from 1688 to 1765, when the scholarships ceased to be distinctively designated. He bequeathed many books and manuscripts to the public library of the university, which are still kept together. The manuscripts include several of his own grammars and lexicons of Coptic, Arabic, Gothic, and Saxon. His Socinian books were left to John Kettlewell whom he made his executor. Lincoln College library hold a collection of Civil War pamphlets, bound into 76 volumes, which Marshall specified were to be held in their library. Works His reputation rests on his philological learning, especially in early Teutonic languages. Franciscus Junius, his former teacher, moved to Oxford in 1676, and lived opposite Lincoln College, in order to be near him. Besides his Observationes in Evangeliorum Versiones perantiquas duas, Gothicas scil. et Anglo-Saxonicas (Dort, 1665; Amsterdam, 1684), he published anonymously The Catechism set forth in the Book of Common Prayer, Oxford, 1679, 1680, 1700. To the later editions was added An Essay of Questions and Answers, also by Marshall. It was translated into Welsh by John Williams of Jesus College, Cambridge, and published at Oxford in 1682. He edited Josephus Abudacnus's Historia Jacubitarum seu Coptorum, in Egypto, Oxford, 1675, and wrote a prefatory epistle to Thomas Hyde's translation of the Gospels and Acts into Malay, Oxford, 1677.

The regiment was raised on 1 April 1967 and disbanded on 25 April 1993. Following subsequent amalgamations and reorganisations the regiment is represented by the 4th Battalion, The Yorkshire Regiment. History The regiment was formed as part of the response to the 1966 Defence Review. This review mandated a reduction in the size of the Territorial Army (TA). As a result, most of the Yorkshire battalions of TA infantry were merged into a single battalion of the new regiment. The battalions merged into the new regiment were: * 3rd Battalion, The Prince of Wales's Own Regiment of Yorkshire * 4th/5th Battalion The Green Howards * The West Riding Battalion The Duke of Wellington's Regiment * The Hallamshire Battalion The York and Lancaster Regiment Regimental headquarters were established at York, with companies based in Sheffield, Middlesbrough, York and Halifax. In 1969 a fifth company was established in Leeds with the amalgamation into the regiment of The Leeds Rifles, The Prince of Wales's Own Regiment of Yorkshire. Following the formation of the Leeds company, the five parent units were reduced to cadre strength and administered by the new regiment. Two years later the 2nd and 3rd Battalions were raised by the five infantry cadres and the three Yorkshire based TA Royal Artillery regiments. The Humber Regiment, Royal Artillery became A (Humber Artillery) Company, 2nd Battalion Yorkshire Volunteers; the West Riding Regiment, Royal Artillery became A Battery, 3rd Battalion Yorkshire Volunteers and the Sheffield Artillery Volunteers became B Battery, 3rd Battalion Yorkshire Volunteers. Battalion headquarters for the newly formed battalions were at York and Huddersfield respectively. On 1 January 1988 a 4th battalion was raised but this was short lived and in 1992 the 3rd and 4th Battalions were merged into the 3rd/4th Battalion with battalion headquarters in Sheffield. The 1990 defence review, Options for Change, decided to reintroduce the relationship between the TA battalions and the regular army regiments. Less than a year after the formation of the 3rd/4th Battalion, the entire regiment was broken up and each battalion became a battalion of the three Yorkshire infantry regiments. 1st Battalion became 4th/5th Battalion Green Howards (Yorkshire Volunteers); 2nd Battalion became 3rd Battalion The Prince of Wales's Own Regiment of Yorkshire (Yorkshire Volunteers); 3rd/4th Battalion became, 3rd Battalion The Duke of Wellington's Regiment (West Riding)(Yorkshire Volunteers).

The National Day of Hatred was an important holiday in the PRK, and the Kampuchean United Front for National Construction and Defense mobilized Kampuchean mass organizations to ensure popular participation.The KUFNCD In the PRK, the policies of the United States (dubbed as imperialist) and the People's Republic of China (dubbed as expansionist) were also targets of dislike during the Day of Hatred. The 1983 conference had formulated that the objective of the National Day of Hatred was to mobilize international public opinion against the Khmer Rouge, their allies and their foreign backers. In particular, the issue of the representation of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea in the United Nations was highlighted. During the 1980s and 1990s, the National Day of Hatred was marked by fiery speeches and the burning of paper effigies of Pol Pot. During the PRK years, the National Day of Hatred represented one of very few spaces for victims of the Khmer Rouge to publicly discuss their experiences from the Democratic Kampuchea period. Also, the event provided an increased space for religious institutions (such as Buddhist temples) to hold functions.Saltsman, Adam. Hate to Remember‚Ä¶and Remember to Hate During the UNTAC period, the National Day of Hatred was put on hiatus as the UN administration sought to involve the Khmer Rouge into the political process. Later in the 1990s, the day was revived. In 2001, the event was officially renamed 'Day of Remembrance'. The National Day of Hatred is still marked in Cambodia, although the commemorations are of smaller scale today. Since the massive defections from the remaining Khmer Rouge guerrillas, the National Day of Hatred lost much of its prominence. Still commemorations are held, such as public theatre plays about the Khmer Rouge period. The Cambodian People's Party (the modern incarnation of the KPRP, the ruling party in the PRK) still conduct commemorations of the National Day of Hatred, often to remind Cambodians of the Khmer Rouge links from the 1980s of the contemporary opposition parties. The Phnom Penh municipality has instituted a tradition of arranging visits to the Choeung Ek fields, where Buddhist ceremonies are held.

Lu Yongxiang was born October 22, 1867, in Jiyang, Shandong, China. Impoverished as a child, he joined the Huai Army in 1890. In 1895 he joined the new Beiyang Army, rising to brigade commander. At the time of the 1911 Xinhai Revolution Lu was given command of the Beiyang 3rd Division. After the Republic of China was established, Lu was appointed commander of the Beiyang Tenth Division, guarding Zhejiang. For joining Duan Qirui, as part of the Anhui clique Lu was made military governor of Zhejiang from August 14, 1919 to September 7, 1924. Near the end of his term as Zhejiang governor he fell out with his counterpart, Jiangsu governor Qi Xieyuan, over control of Shanghai and their conflict became the First Jiangsu-Zhejiang War. Lu was defeated by Qi and his Zhili clique allies, most importantly Sun Chuanfang, when Sun attacked from the south. His control over Zhejiang collapsed when the local civil administration under Xia Chao defected to the Zhili clique. On October 13, 1924, Lu retired and sought asylum in Japan. After the Beijing coup on November 11, Duan Qirui appointed Lu as military governor of Zhili Province. After a month he was replaced, but he was made military governor of Jiangsu on January 16, 1925, after a joint Anhui-Fengtian expedition under Zhang Zongchang briefly retook Jiangsu and Shanghai in January. He left office on August 5, 1925, replaced by Yang Yuting as Zhang Zuolin's army entered the province. When Sun Chuanfang invaded the province and drove Zhang Zongchang out, Lu fled to Tianjin, where he lived in seclusion until he died in 1933.

Differing opinions can arise depending on if the death is categorized as brain death or cease of the heartbeat. It is important for doctors and health care providers to be knowledgeable about differentiating theological and cultural views on death and organ donations as nations are becoming more multicultural. General overview Due to the recent advancements in medical technology, many religious and moral dilemmas have impacted biomedical ethics. It is difficult to reach full consensus on organ donation within each religion. One of the main problems that has come from these advancements in the past few decades has been defining death, which leads to organ donation and transplantation controversy. In 1968, Harvard medical school defined death as 'irreversible coma.' It is important for healthcare practitioners to understand formal religious views on bioethics and organ donations in multicultural societies so medical advancements can still be aligned with religious views. Both receiving and donating organs is up to interpretation as there is no direct references to the process in religious texts. Because of this, many scholars, religious authorities and individuals interpret the readings differently. All this allows for different views between religions as well as within major religions. Any religious processes and traditions that occur right after death also effect views on organ donation. Christianity Christians generally support organ donation as an altruistic act and leaves the process as an individual decision. The Church of England has stated that organ donation is an act of Christian duty. =Catholicism= Catholics believe the dead body is designed for resurrection and eternal life. However, love and communion are key beliefs in Catholic religion and an organ donor's act is considered an act of self-giving and communion. The New Testament suggests in the Gospel of Matthew 22:39, \\"Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.\\" Pope John Paul II interpreted this Golden Rule in his quote,\\"We shall receive our supreme reward from God according to the genuine and effective love we have shown to our neighbor.\\" Pope Benedict XVI has owned a donor card since the 1970s, but deceased popes cannot become organ donors because their bodies must be buried intact, and preserved as potential relics. =Jehovah's Witnesses= Since Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses are not allowed to accept external blood products, their view on organ donation is complicated by the medical procedure itself. Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses believe that organ donation with no transfusion of blood is an individual decision.https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1101990002#h=23 Islam The majority of Islamic religious leaders accept organ donation during life (provided it does not harm the donor) and after death in order to save someone's life. Most religious leaders do not accept brain death as a criterion and consider cessation of all signs of life including heart beat as a precondition for declaring death. Despite this position by Islamic religious leaders, Muslims are oftentimes uncertain about whether or not Islamic tradition considers organ donation to be forbidden. This uncertainty stems from ambiguity caused by conflicting opinions among some Islamic leaders regarding this issue. Moreover, a lack of support along with a generally negative attitude toward organ donation and transplantation has been reflected in surveys of diverse Islamic populations. This overall negativity towards organ donation has resulted in low rates of participation in organ donation by practicing Muslims even in cases where donation would be considered permissible by religious leaders. The Islamic bioethical concepts of autonomy, beneficence, justice and non-malfeasance is theocentric not anthropocentric and adhere to Shari‚Äôa law. Guiding directives of Islam include the right of the community and the right to health. Shari‚Äôa law divides the conduct of human right into two categories: Huquq-Allah, right of God, and Huquq al-Ibad, right of the individual. The primary sources of Shari‚Äôa law are the Quran and Sunnah, and this is enforced by Ijtihad. Muslims believe that humans do not have ownership of their body or spirit, it is considered to be God's gift. Judges of organ donation ethics question whether the noble act of donating an organ outweighs the desecration of a dead body. Additionally, some Muslims believe that all body parts must be present on the Day of Judgement and organ donations would interfere with that testimony. Many Ayatollahs view organ donations differently. For example, Grand Ayatollahs Ali al-Sistani did not approve of posthumous organ donation, while Grand Ayatollahs Abu al-Qasim al- Khoei allowed donation of all organs after death as long as the body could still be recognizable. Practicers of Shia Islam consider minor, regenerative organ donations different than major, non-regenerative organs. Some points of view that Muslims hold are based on the Prophet Muhammad‚Äôs teachings. The quote ‚ÄúWhoever helps another will be granted help from Allah in the Hereafter‚Äù has been interpreted by some Muslims in support of organ donation. Theological influences are particularly strong in the Muslim community and many refer to the work of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) and the Muslim World League (MWL), two Pan-Islamic transnational committees that debate and decide on bioethical topics. The MWL is composed of professional experts representing diverse fields of study and the OIC is composed solely of Islamic scholars. These two highly influential organizations independently attempted to produce a conclusion in respect to brain death. The OIC convened to produce a solution that balanced different views and accepted the brain death concept in 1986, officially equating it with cardiopulmonary failure. Consequently, the OIC permitted cadaveric organ transplantations in 1988. The MWL referenced the work of the OIC and allows for the artificial respirator to be turned off in the case of brain death, however, it did not accept brain death as the final indicator of death. It is important to note that the MWL accepted organ transplantation before the OIC in 1985, and permits it on the condition that death is established via cardiopulmonary failure. In 1996, the United Kingdom Muslim Law Council declared that organ donation coincides with Islamic beliefs. =Egypt= In recent decades, organ transplantation has become a major topic of disagreement in Egypt. The Egyptian Parliament has not yet been able to develop an organ transplant program or any other laws concerning the subject. Most of the opposition comes from the existence of a black market and organ theft that has tainted the view citizens have on organ donation. Since Muslims believe organs belong to God, proponents suggest it is God who ultimately saves the patient and opponents suggest that one can not donate an organ that they themselves do not own. Muhammad Metwali Al Shaarawy was a popular figure in Egypt whose quote, \\"How can you give a kidney that you yourself do not own?\\" influenced Egyptian views on organ donation. =Iran= In Iran, an Islamic ruling nation, laws have been passed in which monetary compensation for kidney donation is legal under regulation. Judaism Like Islam, the body requires burial within 24 hours of death and any unnecessary interference with the body should be avoided. The Jewish Law, Halakha, discusses the moral obligation (mitzvah) of saving one's life, which many scholars and rabbis consider to outweigh the consequences of interfering with one's body. This quote represents pikuach nefesh, which is the term used in Jewish Law for saving one‚Äôs life and overrides any other regulations in Jewish law that would prohibit organ donations. Jewish medical ethics takes a unique approach. It encourages live organ donation, such as kidney transplant, partial liver lobe (Adult/Child) transplant and the like, when two basic conditions are met, firstly, that the operation does not (significantly) endanger the life of the donor, and secondly, that the recipient's life will be saved through this donation. However, opinions are divided on the issue of organ donations which will permanently end the donor's heart beating, in a case when the donor is brain dead. According to one school of thought, the definition of death is indicated by irreversible cessation of heart beat. Hence, this view does not allow vital organs to be removed from a brain dead patient, as stopping the heart from beating is, in their view, tantamount to killing. Conversely, the other school of thoughtSee Moshe Tendler's elucidation of Rabbi Moshe Feinstein's responsa (which include many Orthodox rabbis and Israel's Chief Rabbinate) the determination of death is based on brain function irrespective of a beating heart. Therefore, according to their view, removing vitals organs from a brain dead patient for the sake of saving a life, is in fact permissible, and even encouraged. As a result of these two orthodox schools of thought, Orthodox Jewish ethics remains divided over key death-related policies. Tactically, opponents to the brain death criterion have requested waivers from state law, as a matter of religious freedom, so as to continue relying on traditional indicators. Meanwhile, proponents of the brain death criterion, such as Halachic Organ Donor Society have been active in advocating organ donations and transplants either at brain death or even at cessation of heart beat, where donation of corneas and skin is still medically possible. =Israel= Israel used a committee of medical and religious authorities in order to create laws regarding organ donation. Two laws were enacted in 2008. First, the Brain-Respiratory Death Law states conditions that determines the conditions necessary to determine brain death. It also allows for both brain death and cease of the heartbeat as acceptable deaths. Second, the Organ Transplantation Law, fully implemented in 2012, addresses the legality and ethics of organ donation in Israel. The law states that organ trade and donor compensation are illegal. A nonprofit NGO called Matnat Chaim was created in Israel in order to promote live-donor kidney transplantation. Their goal is to be in accordance with Jewish law and states that the act is considered a laudatory one. Only about 10% of the Israeli population owns an organ donor card. Buddhism The spiritual consciousness remaining in the body after death leads to discrepancy on organ donation in the Buddhist community. Issues with defining a diagnosis of brainstem death also provides contradictions in organ donation views. The Buddha is believed to have sacrificed himself by jumping into a fire in order to nourish a lost and starved villager in woods, in a previous life as a rabbit. This bodhisattva value of compassion is also expressed through organ donation by putting another person‚Äôs wellness above one‚Äôs own. Donations made based on monetary or societal motivation are not valued by Buddhists. A person‚Äôs spiritual consciousness continues through the path of the bardo and rebirth after death. Some believe that since physical organs are useless after death, donating them is an act of great compassion. Other‚Äôs believe that in order to ensure positive rebirth, the dying individual should not be disturbed. However, organs have to be harvested right after brain death is declared in order to be useful. These considerations allow for differentiating views depending on the individual. The choice of making the donation has to be made by the donor him/herself according to Buddhism. It's not clear brain death is a form of death according to Buddhism. But if it considered as death, in which case one cannot make decision oneself, it may or may not be a good deed for one who died and also for the ones involved in decision making and contributing. Some Buddhists believe in the value of compassion, in which actions such as organ donation can be used to overcome the sufferings of life. Buddhism generally accepts brainstem death and the irreversible ability for respiration as a valid criteria for death of a human being. A living body or a dead body in Japanese culture is considered to be the permanent carrier of the soul. This belief has made it hard to develop a unanimous agreement on brain death in Japan. Many Buddhists in Eastern Asia adopt the Confucian taboos that are against destruction or disfiguring the human body. Because of this view, many countries in East Asia have low rates of organ donation. Because Hawai‚Äôi has a large Asian population, these cultural and religious ideals can be reflected in their participation in organ donation. As a state, they have the lowest rate of organ donations compared the rest of the United States. Tibetan Buddhists believe the spirit may remain in the body until about a week after death, therefore organ donation can be seen as interfering with the next rebirth. Pure Land Buddhism is a branch of Mahayana Buddhism that is against organ donation. They believe that the soul should be able to leave peacefully towards the path of rebirth. Since the soul takes time to depart from the physical body, they believe the body should not be disturbed when brain death is declared. In Korea and Taiwan, organ donation is successfully adopted. Hinduism In Hinduism, the physical integrity of the body after death is not considered important. Hindu values reincarnation and prolonging life which allows for many individuals to agree with organ donation. Life after death is a strong belief of Hinduism and is an ongoing process of rebirth. It is a perpetual circle of birth and rebirth of the soul, so the physical body is insignificant. The effects of this view on the concept of organ donation and transplantation in Hinduism are various. Other Dharmic faiths hold similar views. Jainism In Jainism, compassion and charity are considered to major virtues. Organ donation has been widely supported by the Jain community leaders and monks.Maitri Porecha, Gurus' discourse: Donate organ, save life, DNA Aug 7, 2013 It has been reported that in Mumbai, 85-90% of all organ donations including eye donations, are by Jains and Gujaratis (a significant fraction of them are Jain in Mumbai).Ratan Sharda Positive Side of Religion, News Bharati, 4/22/2013 Gujarat has had considerable success with the eye donation program due to a significant population of the Jain community, which considers eye donation as a sublime form of charity.Sunil Shroff Legal and ethical aspects of organ donation and transplantation Indian J.

Their founder was the nephew of High King Brian Boru (1002‚Äì1014). The name Cinn√©ide belonged to Brian Boru's father Cenn√©tig mac Lorc√°in, King of Thomond, in the tenth century AD.House of Brian Boru. http://houseofbrianboru.blogspot.com.au/p/brian-boru.html (Brian Boru was an Ard R√≠ or High King of Ireland). The Kennedys did not descend directly from Brian Boru, but from Cinn√©ide's eldest son Donncuan. Donncuan's son Mahon was the first to call himself √ì Cinn√©ide which is Irish for grandson of Cinn√©ide. Placenames such as Killokennedy in Thomond are indicative of their longstanding presence in the region. History The Kennedys belonged to the powerful D√°l gCais people of Thomond, headed by the O'Briens. They resided in far eastern Clare, northern Limerick, Mayo, and northern Tipperary in an area called Ormond. Originally seated in Glemor, near Killaloe in Co. Clare, they migrated across the river Shannon to Ormond in Co. Tipperary following pressure from other septs in the region (mainly the O'Briens and the McNamaras) in the 12th century. They soon grew in power to become lords in Ormond from the 11th to 16th centuries. The Annals of the Four Masters described them in 1300 to be \\"the undisputed Lords of Ormond\\". Placenames such as Coolkennedy and Garrykennedy in Upper Ormond and Killokennedy in Thomond are indicative of their longstanding presence in the region. The sept split into three branches, the chiefs of which were referred to by their hair colours: (brown), (blond), and (red). St Ruadhan of Lorrha was the special protector of the Kennedys of Ormond. Around 1600, a branch of the sept migrated to Co. Antrim where many Kennedys are still found today. According to Daithi O'hOgain (Associate Professor at University College Dublin), there is a lineage of Irish Kennedys descended directly from Brian Boru: \\"The name Cinneide also continued in the direct O'Brien line. For instance, a branch of the family descended from King Donnchadh, son of Brian Boru, settled in Aherloe in south Tipperary, one section of which had the name Cinneide as a surname. Another Cinneide O'Briain, grandson of the same Donnchadh, was a strong opponent of his kinsman, King Toirdhealbhach, and on this account he was assisted by the Connacht king, Aedh O'Ruairc of Breffny, to set up a kingdom of his own on the Meath-Cavan border. This little kingdom was broken up by Toirdhealbhach's army in 1080, and Cinneide O'Briain himself was slain in 1084 at the Battle of Monecronock, near Leixlip in Count Kildare. The connection with the O'Rourkes of Breffny did not end, however, for people bearing the name Cinneide settled in that area of County Leitrim. These were known by the synonym Muimhneach (\\"Munster-man\\"), which is anglicised as the surnames Mimnagh and Minnagh.\\"(O'hOgain D. (2003) 'Kennedy O'Cinneide', Gill & Macmillan, Dublin pp40‚Äì1) To add to the confusion, there are the Kennedys of nine-county Ulster in the north of Ireland. The Kennedys who settled in Ulster are mostly of Scottish origin from the territories of Galloway and Ayr just across the Irish Sea away. Many Scottish Kennedys were planters in Ulster, and many Scots went south to Dublin and mingled with the Irish clan. In the aftermath of the Black Death, there was a Gaelic resurgence in Ireland as the plague more heavily hit the Normans in the urbanised areas. The main rivals of the O'Kennedys were the Norman-descended Butlers who were Earls of Ormond (a title of the Lordship of Ireland). The two families signed a peace treaty in 1336, followed by another in 1347. The latter was broke when the O'Kennedys, with their Irish allies, the O'Briens and O'Carrolls, attacked and burned Nenagh. The O'Kennedys were able to use the Butler‚ÄìFitzGerald dispute to attack the Butlers whenever they were overstretched by attacks from the Earl of Desmond. The O'Kennedys and their native Irish allies were able to drive the Butler dynasty out from Nenagh Castle in 1391 and set themselves up there (these Butlers moved out to Kilkenny Castle). Castles Nenagh Castle: the O'Kennedys struggled with the Butlers for control. The Kennedys' castles in Ireland were all located near Nenagh in County Tipperary. The following castles were built by, or held by the Kennedys: *Ballintotty Castle *Ballycapple Castle *Dromineer Castle *Garrykennedy Castle *Lackeen Castle *Nenagh Castle * Knigh Castle * Urra Castle * Ballyartella Castle As well as this there were castles at Glenahilty, Kilmochnage, Bawndownmore, Carrigichonigrick, Swyffine, Beallachavvine, Ballingarry, Lackeen, Ballycappel, Annagh, Ballaghfymoye, Ballyquirke, Kilcarron, Rathurles, Dunally and Castle Otway.

Barrett‚Äôs studies of hypnosis have focused on different types of high hypnotizables, finding two subgroups which she terms fantasizers and dissociaters. Fantasizers are people who have vivid imaginations, find it easy to block out real-world stimuli, spend much time daydreaming, report imaginary companions as a child and grew up with parents who encouraged imaginary play. Dissociaters usually had a history of childhood abuse or other significant trauma, had learned to escape into numbness, and to forget unpleasant events. Their association to ‚Äúdaydreaming‚Äù was often going blank rather than vividly recalled fantasies. Both score equally high on formal scales of hypnotic susceptibility.Barrett, Deirdre.

It was of wood construction with a tailskid landing gear, powered by a 20 hp (15 kW) Advance V-4 air-cooled engine . It used a wing with a shape patented by Jos√© Weiss which was claimed to provide automatic lateral stability, so there were no ailerons or wing warping mechanisms. Weiss was also responsible for the design of its tractor propeller. The wings, fuselage and tail surfaces were covered with a blue-grey rubberised fabric, hence the nickname Bluebird. After the aircraft had been displayed at the second Olympia Aero Exhibition, Handley Page successfully made a few straight hops in the Bluebird on 26 May 1910, but crashed at the first attempt to make a turn.Barnes 1976, pp.8, 50-2. Handley Page improved the design to include lateral control via wing warping and fitted a 25 hp (18.6 kW) Alvaston water- cooled flat-twin engine. The rebuilt aircraft was designated Handley Page Type C but it refused to fly. Although work was completed on modifying the aircraft to take a 50 hp (37 kW) Isaacson radial engine it was abandoned in late 1910. It ended its life as an instructional airframe at the Northampton Polytechnic Institute in Clerkenwell, where Handley Page was a lecturer.Barnes 1976, p.9 In 1924 the company retrospectively applied model numbers, the Type A became the HP.1 and the Type C the HP.3.

The provincial government of Manitoba, in an effort to encourage industry in the province, promised Saunders funding if they would move to Gimli, which the company agreed to. By 1970, the government had given the company $37 million. The company produced thirteen of its Saunders ST-27 aircraft, which were converted de Havilland Herons.

He was a regicide of Charles I.Also known as Matthew Tomlinson He was a colonel of horse (cavalry) in the New Model Army, he was one of the officers presenting the remonstrance to parliament in 1647. He took charge of Charles I in 1648, until the execution, but refused to be his judge. He followed Cromwell to Scotland in 1650. On Cromwell's dissolution of the Rump Parliament he was chosen as one of the members of the Council of State that succeeded it, and of the Barebones Parliament. Sent to Ireland to join the government there, he was knighted by Henry Cromwell who, nevertheless, distrusted him; in 1658 he was recalled to London as one of Ireland's representatives in Oliver Cromwell's new House of Peers.Concise Dictionary of National Biography (1930)Cobbett's Parliamentary history of England, from the Norman Conquest in 1066 to the year 1803 (London: Thomas Hansard, 1808) He was impeached by the parliamentary party in 1660 but escaped punishment at the restoration of the monarchy. Biography Thomlinson baptised 24 September 1617, was the second son of John Thomlinson of York, and Eleanor, daughter of Matthew Dodsworth. cites Dugdale, Visitation of Yorkshire, 1665, Surtees Soc. xxxvi. 66. Thomlinson was one of the gentlemen of the Inns of Court who enlisted to form the lifeguard of Robert,Earl of Essex in 1642. cites Ludlow, Memoirs, i. 39, ed. 1894. On 25 March 1645 Whitelocke mentions the defeat of a party of the garrison of Wallingford by Captain Thomlinson and a detachment from Abingdon. cites Whitelocke Memorials, ed. 1853, i. 411. In the New Model Army he held the rank of major in Sir Robert Pye's regiment of horse, cites Sprigge, Anglia Rediviva, p. 331. becoming colonel of that regiment in the summer of 1647. During the quarrel between the army and the Long Parliament, he adhered to the former and was one of the officers presenting the remonstrance of the army (25 June 1647) to Parliament. cites Rushworth, vi. 592. On 23 December 1648 the Army Council ordered him to take charge of the King, then at Windsor, and Charles remained in his custody at St. James's during the trial, and up to the day of his execution. cites Clarke Papers, Camden Soc. ii. 140‚Äì7. Thomlinson then delivered Charles up to Colonel Hacker, the bearer of the death-warrant, but, at the King's request, accompanied him as far as the entrance to the scaffold. Charles gave him a gold toothpick and case as a legacy. cites Trial of the Regicides, p. 218; cf. Memoirs of Sir Thomas Herbert, ed. 1701, p. 133. Thomlinson had been appointed by the Rump Parliament one of the King's Judges, but had declined to sit in the court. In 1650 Thomlinson and his regiment followed Oliver Cromwell to Scotland. cites Cal. State Papers, Dom. 1650, p. 297. On 17 January 1652 he was appointed one of the committee for the reformation of the law. cites Commons' Journals, vii. 74. On Cromwell's dissolution of the Rump Parliament in April 1653, he was one of the members of the Council of State chosen by the Council of Officers of the army, and on 5 July 1653 he was also co-opted to sit in the Barebones Parliament. cites Commons' Journals, vii. 281, 283; Cal. State Papers, Dom. 1652‚Äì3, p. 339. During the greater part of the Protectorate Thomlinson was employed in Ireland as one of the council first of Charles Fleetwood (27 August 1654) and afterwards of Henry Cromwell (16 November 1657). cites Deputy Keeper of Irish Records, 14th Rep. pp. 28, 29. On 11 December 1654, when the officers of the English occupation army in Ireland made their agreement with Dr. (afterwards Sir) William Petty for the survey of Ireland, there was \\"a solemn seeking of God, performed by Colonel Thomlinson, for a blessing upon the conclusion of so great a business\\". cites Larcom, Hist. of the Down Survey, p. 22. Henry Cromwell found him rather a thorn in his side, and, in spite of his \\"sly carriage\\", suspected him of stirring up disaffection against his government and of secret intrigues with the republican opposition. cites Thurloe Papers, vi. 223, 857, vii. 199. Nevertheless, Henry Cromwell, when he became Lord Deputy, selected Thomlinson for knighthood (24 November 1657), in order to show his willingness to be reconciled to old opponents; nor did he hesitate to give him a commendatory letter when he went to England. cites Thurloe Papers, vi. 632, vii. 291. The Protector summoned Thomlinson to sit in his House of Lords, but his employment detained him in Ireland. cites Thurloe Papers, vi. 732. On 7 July 1659 the restored rump Parliament made Thomlinson one of the five commissioners for the civil government of Ireland. cites Commons' Journals, vii. 678, 707. In the quarrel which followed between Parliament and the army he was suspected of too great an inclination to the cause of the latter, and was consequently arrested (13 December 1659) and impeached (19 January 1660) by the supporters of the parliamentary party. cites Ludlow, Memoirs, ed. 1894, ii. 186, 464. The impeachment, however, was not proceeded with, and when Thomlinson arrived in England he was permitted to remain at liberty on giving his engagement not to disturb the existing government. cites Ludlow, Memoirs, ed. 1894, ii. 255. At the restoration of the monarchy Thomlinson was excepted by name from the order for the arrest of the King's judges and the seizure of their estates (17 May 1660). In his petition to the House of Lords he stated that he had never taken part in the proceedings against Charles I (though his name had been mistakenly inserted among those who sat and gave judgement). He pleaded also that the King had specially recommended him to his son for his civility, and, as this was confirmed by the evidence of Henry Seymour, the Lords agreed with the Commons to free him from any penalty. cites Hist. MSS. Comm. 7th Rep. p. 123; Old Parliamentary History, xxii. 299, 402. Charles II and some royalists argued that Thomlinson ought to have allowed the King to escape, and grudged him his impunity. cites Ludlow, ii. 286. At the trial of the regicides Thomlinson bore evidence against Colonel Hacker, but most of his testimony was directed to his own vindication. cites Trial of the Regicides, p. 218. He lost by the Restoration Ampthill Park, which he had acquired during the Commonwealth. cites Cal. State Papers, Dom. 1660‚Äì1, p. 236. He died on 3 November 1681, and was buried in the church of East Malling, near Maidstone.Thomlinson's portrait by Mytens represents him with long dark hair (Cat. First Loan Exhibition of National Portraits at South Kensington, No. 738). Family Thomlinson married Pembroke, daughter of Sir William Brooke, with whom he had two daughters: * Jane, who married Philip Owen, and died in 1703; * Elizabeth, died unmarried. His widow died on 10 June 1683, and was buried in East Malling church.

On their way Jeffrey makes a detour to Sylacauga, Alabama, to show her where he grew up and introduce her to his childhood friends, Robert and Possum and their wives. They plan to spend the night in Jeffrey's old bedroom but Sara's first meeting with his mother upsets her so, she dashes out into the street. When Jeffrey finally catches up to her, they hear a scream and gunshots coming from Robert's house. Jeffrey kicks in the door and finds a wounded Robert and his wife with a dead man in their bedroom, and their stories are conflicting and shaky. Sara and Jeffrey assist in the ensuing investigation and when it's finally resolved, Jeffrey finds that some of those closest to him during his past were not who he thought they were, and some of his deepest secrets are revealed to Sara. But that's only half the book‚Äîfast forward to the present, where the Heartsdale Police Station is taken over in a murderous bloodbath by heavily armed gunmen, right in the middle of an elementary school field trip, and while Sara is there. A terrifying and tense hostage situation develops. Lena, back on the force now, on her birthday, and suspecting she's become pregnant by abusive boyfriend Ethan Green, is one of the few Grant County cops on the outside, not knowing who's dead and who's alive. What do the gunmen want? Who are they? Is this somehow related to the events in Sylacauga all those years ago?

Geography  This heavily-wooded landscape lies between Bleicherode in Nordhausen district, Sondershausen in Kyffh√§user district, Bad Frankenhausen, Dingelst√§dt, Oldisleben, Kindelbr√ºck and Schernberg. It is bordered to the north by the Kyffh√§user Hills () on the other side of the Wipper, to the east ‚Äì beyond the so-called Thuringian Gate, a gorge carved out by the Unstrut near little Sachsenburg ‚Äì by the Schm√ºcke and the Hohe Schrecke, and to the south and southwest by the Thuringian Basin. = Important towns = * Sondershausen, capital of Kyffh√§user district * Bad Frankenhausen = Hills = The highest elevationsee the discussion at German Wikipedia is the point located in the western part of the Hainleite between Immenrode and Strau√überg. Other hills include the Possen (420 m), the Heidelberg (403 m) and the Kuhberg (406 m). = Geology and landscape = The underlying rock consists of red sandstone and Muschelkalk. To the north the Hainleite falls relatively steeply into the valley of the Wipper (about 200‚Äì163 m), which joins the Unstrut at Sachsenburg. To the south the dip slope of the Hainleite descends relatively gently into the Erfurt Lowland (Erfurter Tiefebene, part of the Thuringian Basin). The vegetation on the Hainleite is characterised by mixed woods and, especially in the east, by dense beech forest. The undergrowth below the trees is dominated by Perlgras and Martagon lilies. Species of orchid abound on the open Muschelkalk slopes. The region north of the Hainleite in the valley of the Wipper between Bad Frankenhausen and Artern is also known as the Diamond Meadow (Diamantene Aue). = Walking = Although not as well known as the Thuringian Forest, the Hainleite is nevertheless a popular walking area. In the area of the district town of Sondershausen alone there are over 30 walking routes. The following well-known trails run from west to east over the crest of the Hainleite: * The Barbarossa trail (Barbarossaweg) from (Korbach, Hessen) to Kyffh√§user * The Hainleite trail (Hainleitewanderweg, no. S2) from Friedrichroda to Sachsenburg * The main trail (Hauptwanderweg) Eisenach‚ÄìSondershausen‚ÄìKyffh√§user‚ÄìWernigerode  Economy  The Hainleite is mainly used for forestry due to the quality of its woods. But tourism also plays an important role. Tourist centres are: * Teich Valley Recreation Park (Erholungszentrum Teichtal) near Hainrode * Sondershausen with its castle * Strau√überg Adventure Park (Erlebnispark Strau√überg) with its monkey forest and Sommerrodelbahn * Possen Hunting Lodge Recreation Park (Erholungszentrum Jagdschloss PossenErholungszentrum), near Sondershausen with bungalows and the historic Possen tower (newly renovated ‚Äì the highest timber-framed tower in Germany) * Bad Frankenhausen spa town (near the Kyffh√§user monument)  Transport  The Hainleite area has good road and rail access. The railway network links the towns of Nordhausen and Sondershausen. The area can be approached by car from the north on the A 38 motorway and B 80 road and from the south by the A 4. The B 4 and B 85 roads run directly over the Hainleite and link the two trunk routes. The north-south link will be improved when the A 71 is completed; currently it only runs from the A 4 near Erfurt as far as S√∂mmerda.

Biography Born in San Francisco to mother Aida Saberi, Edo was an only child from Aida‚Äôs first marriage. Later Aida remarried and had two more sons, Thomas & Ted Saberi. Edo attended Grattan Elementary, Herbert Hoover Junior High and J. Eugene McAteer High School, all in the city by the bay. Edo grew up during the tumultuous 1960s, where from an early age he was exposed to a myriad of musical styles, listening not only to rock and roll and R&B;, but classical music, folk and jazz. His first Jazz albums were given to him by his late Uncle, recording engineer pioneer Reice Hamel. From these, Edo was first exposed to and smitten by the sounds of Vince Guaraldi, Hugh Masekela, Ahmad Jamal, Bill Evans, Ramsey Lewis and Paul Desmond. Edo initially studied piano and violin. But when a friend suggested that he try the electric bass, he knew he had found his instrument and did everything he could to immerse himself in it, seeking out and learning whatever he could from whoever would take the time to teach him. Musical education Edo attended Humboldt State University in northern California. With less than three years playing bass, he bought an acoustic bass and auditioned for the music department at San Jose State University. While studying there, he met musicians from across the country. He was so inspired by their sound, he moved to Chicago in 1982, his uncle‚Äôs hometown, to pursue his music education. He studied at DePaul University for a year, then completed his studies at the American Conservatory of Music, earning a Bachelor of Arts in 1987 with a focus on jazz studies and electric bass. During his time at the Conservatory in Chicago, Edo rose through the musical ranks, often recommended for gigs by his teachers. By the time Edo graduated from the Conservatory, Chicago magazine had noted him as ‚ÄúOne of Chicago‚Äôs finest.‚Äù He continued to hone his craft in Chicago until 1990 when he returned to the Bay Area. Musical career Edo‚Äôs formative years were spent developing his skills in various funk, jazz and rock bands in the Bay Area and Chicago. In the late 1970s Edo studied and performed with Lou Harrison and Gamelan Si Betty. This led to one of his first compositions for American gamelan being published by Lou Harrison. Since his return to the Bay Area in 1990, Edo has worked on 20 CD projects and has performed/recorded with David Amram, Mark Walker, Hassan Kahn , Pete Cosey, Roy Haynes, Fareed Haque, David Onderdonk, Ed Thigpen, Johnny Griffin, Joel Harrison, Jim Trompeter, Ian Doogle, Deborah Winters, Jill Knight, Paul Van Wageningen, Caroline Aiken, Dan Zinn, Bethany Pickens, Michael LaMacchia, Armando Peraza, Caren Armstrong, Percy Howard, Mike Molenda, Stuart Hamm, Lorn Leber, Michael Manring, Mark Egan, Yves Carbonne, and David Friesen. Edo‚Äôs fan base stretches the globe (with sales in Norway, Switzerland, Germany, France, Japan, Spain, Argentina, Italy and England) where he has found praise and recognition for his unique musical talents and his joyous and transfixing compositions, and recognized internationally for his rare proficiency on several varieties of the extended- range bass.

Life=Ancestry= Negroni was born in Rome, the eldest of the two sons of Count Giovanni Battista Negroni, whose family had originated from Bergamo, and his wife, Ludovisi di San Casiano. Their other child was Stanislaus. Through him, the Negroni family was added to the Roman nobility in 1746. His grandfather, Count Giovanni Francesco Negroni, had been appointed as Governor of the territory of Orvieto, part of the Papal States, in 1673 by the Holy See. The family name is also listed as Nigronus. In 1725, their father, Count Giovanni Battista Negroni was introduced to the Stuart Pretender, James Stuart, the would-be James III of England. He acted as his host that year and came to be a friend of the Stuart family. The Count was deeply involved in astrology and came to be suspected of necromancy, which was considered to be heresy by the Church. It was a crime under which several people from his own estates were condemned as sorcerers and witches and were sentenced to be burned to death. Due to his family connections with the Church, the Count was spared any investigation. After his death in 1730, however, all his notes and writings were burned.La Casata Negroni (in Italian) =Church career= Starting in 1735, Andrea Negroni occupied several posts of increasing responsibility in the Roman Curia, notably at the Apostolic Signatura, and was appointed a secular canon of St Peter's Basilica in 1759.

Negroni was made a Cardinal-Deacon by Pope Clement XIII in the consistory of 18 July 1763, receiving his red hat three days later, and given the titular Church of S. Maria in Aquiro. He went on to be given additional posts appropriate to his new station, such as Auditor of His Holiness (1765) and Secretary of the Chancery of Apostolic Briefs (1767-1775). He also served as the Cardinal Protector of the Cistercian Order, as well as of the Bernardine nuns and the Basilian monks, as well as of Bergamo and numerous towns and groups. In 1765, he was granted the transfer of his title to the Church of Sts. Vitus, Modest and Crescentius. In 1763 the Cardinal took responsibility for raising the young Marquess Ercole Consalvi, whose father had just died. Consalvi went on to become an official of the Papal Court, and himself a Cardinal, rising to the office of Cardinal Secretary of State under Pope Pius VII, whose chief advisor he was through the turbulent years of the French occupation of Italy (1797-1814).

Cognitive models generally fall into the category of executive dysfunction or modulatory control. Neuroanatomically, functional and structural neuroimaging studies implicate the prefrontal cortex (PFC), basal ganglia (BG), insula, and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). Genetic and neurochemical studies implicate glutamate and monoamine neurotransmitters, especially serotonin and dopamine. Neuroanatomy=Models= The cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop (CBGTC) model is based on the observation that the basal ganglia loops related to the OFC and ACC are implicated in OCD by neuroimaging studies, although the directionality of volumetric and functional changes is not consistent. Causal evidence from OCD secondary to neuropsychiatric disorders supports the CBGTC model. Obsessions may arise from failure of the circuit to gate information that is normally implicitly processed, leading to representation in explicit processing systems such as the dlPFC and hippocampus, and thereby resulting in obsessions. Abnormal affect in OCD has been hypothesized to result from dysfunction in the OFC, ventral striatum, and amygdala. OCD is characterized by high levels of anxiety, high rates of comorbidity with major depressive disorder, and blunted response to reward. This is reflected by reduced amygdala and ventral striatum response to positive stimuli, and elevated amygdala response to fearful stimuli. Furthermore, deep brain stimulation of the nucleus accumbens is an effective treatment of OCD, and symptom improvement correlates with reduced binding of dopamine receptors. The reduced binding, due to the ability of the radioligand tracers to be displaced by endogenous dopamine, is taken to reflect increased basal dopamine release. Affective dysregulation due to blunted reward, and elevated fear sensitivity may promote compulsivity by assigning excessive motivational salience to avoidance behavior. The ventral striatum is important in action selection, and receives inputs from the medial OFC that signal various aspects of value for stimulus association outcomes. By assigning abnormal values to certain behaviors, OFC may lead to compulsive behavior through modulating action selection in the ventral striatum. A number of abnormalities have been found in the OFC, including reduced volume, increased resting state activity, and reduced activity during cognitive tasks. The difference between resting and cognitive paradigms may be due to increased signal to noise ratio, a possible mechanism of aberrant valuation. OFC-striatum connectivity also predicts symptom severity, although the opposite has been found in some studies. Besides abnormal valuation of stimuli or tasks, compulsions may be driven by dysfunction in error monitoring that leads to excessive uncertainty. OCD has also been conceptualized as resulting from dysfunction in response inhibition, and fear extinction. While hyperactivation of the OFC as a whole during resting is observed in OCD, hyperactivation of the lateral OFC and hypoactivation of the mOFC is seen. This is congruent with the localization of fear/avoidance behaviors to the lOFC and emotional regulation to the mOFC. Hyperactivity of the dACC during monitoring task, along with hyperactivity of the lOFC and amygadala may all contribute to generating obsessions, reduced regulation by the mOFC may enable them. One model suggests that obsessions do not drive compulsions, but are rather byproducts of compulsions, as evidenced by some studies reporting excessive reliance on habit. Dysfunctional habit based learning may be a driver behind neuroimaging studies of memory reporting increased hippocampus activity. The conscious processing of information that is normally implicitly processing may be the underlying cause of obsessions. =Functional neuroimaging= Functional neuroimaging studies have implicated multiple regions in OCD. Symptom provocation is associated with increased likelihood of activation in the bilateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), right anterior PFC, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), left precuneus, right premotor cortex, left superior temporal gyrus (STG), bilateral external globus pallidus, left hippocampus, right insula, left caudate, right posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and right superior parietal lobule. The medial portion of the orbitofrontal cortex connects with the paralimbic-limbic system, including the insular cortex, cingulate gryus, amygdala, and hypothalamus. This area is involved in encoding the representation of the value of an expected outcome, which is used to anticipate positive and negative consequences that are likely to follow a given action.[8] During affective tasks hyperactivation has been observed in the ACC, insula and head of the caudate and putamen, regions implicated in salience, arousal, and habit. Hypoactivation during affective tasks is observed in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and posterior caudate, which are implicated in behavioral and cognitive control. During non-affective tasks, hyperactivation has been observed in the precuneus and PCC, while hypoactivation has been observed in the pallidum, ventral anterior thalamus and posterior caudate. An older meta analysis found hyperactivity in the OFC and ACC. An ALE meta analysis of various functional neuroimaging paradigms observed various abnormalities during Go/no go, interference, and task switching paradigms. Decreased likelihood of activation in right putamen and cerebellum was reported during Go/no go. During interference tasks, likelihood of activation was reported in the left superior frontal gyrus, right precentral gyrus, and left cingulate gyrus, to be decreased, and in the right caudate to be increased. Task switching was associated with extensive decreased likelihood of activation in the middle, medial, inferior, superior frontal gyri, caudate, cingulate and precuneus. A separate ALE meta analysis found consistent abnormalities in orbitofrontal, striatal, lateral frontal, anterior cingulate, middle occipital and parietal, and cerebellar regions. =Structural neuroimaging= Differences in grey matter, white matter and structural connectivity have been observed in OCD. One meta-analysis reported grey matter increases in the bilateral lenticular nuclei, and grey matter decreases in the ACC (anterior cingulate cortex) and mPFC (medial prefrontal cortex). Another meta-analysis reported that global volumes are not decreased, but the left ACC and OFC demonstrate decreased volume, while the thalamus but not basal ganglia have increased volumes. An ALE meta analysis found increased grey matter in the left postcentral gyrus, middle frontal region, putamen, thalamus, left ACC, and culmen, while decreased grey matter was reported in the right temporal gyrus and left insula extending to the inferior frontal gyrus. Overlapping abnormalities in white matter volume and diffusivity have been reported. Increased white matter volume and decreased Fractional anisotropy has been observed in anterior midline tracts, interpreted as indicating increased crossings. However, given these effects were most pronounced in medicated adults, it is possible that medication plays a role An ALE meta analysis has observed increased FA in the superior longitudinal fasiculus and corpus callosum, and decreased FA in inferior longitudinal and cingulum fibers. Neurochemistry Glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter has been implicated in OCD. MRS studies have observed decreased Glx (glutamate, glutamine and GABA) in the striatum. However, increased Glx has been reported in the ACC. Furthermore, increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glutamate and glycine have been found. Various preclinical models have supported glutamate signaling dysfunction in OCD, and treatment with glutamatergic agents such as the glutamate-inhibiting riluzole has been reported to be efficacious. Reduced dopamine D1 receptors and dopamine D2 receptors in the striatum have been reported in people with OCD, along with both increased and decreased reports of dopamine transporter (DAT) binding. While antipsychotics are sometimes used to treat refractory OCD, they frequently fail in treating or exacerbate OCD symptoms. Treatment with deep brain stimulation is effective in OCD, and response correlates with increased dopamine in the nucleus accumbens. Combined this evidence suggests that OCD may be associated with both increased and decreased dopamine signaling, or that a unidirectional model may not be adequate. Drug challenge studies have implicated 5-HT2A and 5-HT2A in OCD. Administration of meta- Chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP), a non selective serotonin (5-HT) release and receptor agonist with a preference for 5-HT2C has been reported to exacerbate OCD symptoms. Psilocybin, a 5-HT2C, 5-HT2A and 5-HT1A receptor agonist has been associated with acute improvement of OCD symptoms. In vivo neuroimaging has found abnormalities with 5-HT2A and serotonin transporter (5-HTT). Inconsistent binding potentials have been observed for 5-HT2A, with both decreased and increased and binding potentials being reported. Inconsistent results have been reported in with respect to 5-HTT as well, with increased, decreased and no changes being reported. Estrogen and OCD Aromatase is an enzyme expressed in several gonadic tissue sites. It is the rate limiting step in the conversion of androgens to estrogen. This conversion can significantly impact estrogen levels in brain areas. These OCD-linked effects have been demonstrated by Aromatase knockout mice (ArKO), who lack a functional enzyme to convert androgens to estrogen. This ArKO knockout strategy has provided a model to examine the physiological impact of lower than normal amounts of estrogen. Studies with ArKO mice have been used to show that varying levels of estrogen affect the onset of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) behaviors. Lower amounts of estrogen are associated with an increase of OCD behaviors in males more than females. Variation in estrogen can lead to increased levels of OCD symptoms within women as well. The disorder itself has a later onset in women, and tends to show two distinct peaks of onset. The first peak occurs around puberty and the second around the age of childbearing. These peaks correlate with time periods where estrogen levels are highest in women.

Joli OS is now an open source project, with source code hosted on GitHub. On 22 November 2013, the developers decided to discontinue Joli OS, but keep the source code open. Jolicloud was discontinued on April 1, 2016. History The project was launched in 2008 by Netvibes founder Tariq Krim and Romain Huet. Krim originally wanted to build a laptop using environmentally friendly manufacturing methods, but the two co-founders refocused the effort on building an operating system. After purchasing a few netbooks and renewing their acquaintance with Linux, they rented office space in the Montorgueil area of Paris and were later joined by another developer, Tristan Grol√©at. The alpha version was built with the help of \\"developers, kernel hackers and designers\\". Venture capital firms Atomico Ventures and Mangrove Capital Partners have provided $4.2 million in funding. Version 1.0 was released in July 2010 and version 1.1 was released on 7 December 2010. Version 1.2 was released on 9 March 2011. Design, hardware compatibility Joli OS was at the beginning built on top of Ubuntu Netbook Edition, and as with that Linux distribution, was tweaked for netbooks and other computers with limited disk storage, memory, and screen size. Joli OS is now built on top of Ubuntu with a customized kernel. Joli OS was designed for easy installation, with Wi-Fi, bluetooth, and 3G modem support all included. The operating system supports all the major netbooks, including models from Asus, Acer, Dell, HP, MSI, Samsung and Sony. Jolicloud claims the OS supports 98% of netbooks with out- of-the-box compatibility but also works on a very large number of other devices, up to 10 years old: laptops, desktops and tablets. Version 1.0 of the operating system incorporates a user interface built primarily with HTML5 that includes an application launcher, a library of compatible applications with one-click installation and removal, a display of all machines associated with a user account, and a social activity stream that enables users to compare installed applications. The launcher displays only those applications supported in the library, but the identical configuration can be viewed from any machine running Joli OS. Account management is available from any computer with an HTML5-compatible browser. Jolicloud's HTML5 implementation is through the Chromium web browser, which serves as middleware for Web rendering. Version 1.0 reviews, response Reviewers evaluating Joli OS differed in their appraisals, depending on whether they were writing for a user who is new to Linux or is more experienced with the operating system. Writing on a Cond√© Nast Traveler blog, Mike Haney called Joli OS \\"an easy, free OS that you don't have to be a code-monkey to install and does everything you need your netbook to do, quickly. I put it on a Lenovo netbook this weekend that was running like molasses under Windows 7, and I'm a convert\\". While Joli OS is not the first operating system designed from Linux targeted at the beginning netbooks, \\"it's the first that doesn't feel like you're using Linux: no funky install procedures, no code, no accessing special directories to find more apps.\\" He compared Joli OS in look and function to iOS, the operating system used by the Apple iPad (as well as the iPhone and iPod Touch), though with the folders and files of a conventional computer\\". In Computerworld, Serdar Yegulalp wrote that Joli OS 1.0 \\"feels like a second beta, not a 1.0 release; it needs more work before it's truly useful instead of one step above a curiosity\\". Yegulalp reported problems launching some applications, including the Google Chrome browser and the VLC media player, an inability to do peer-to-peer mesh networking, the power button getting blocked by open windows, and no hibernation mode, even if the computer supports it. He noted comparable performance with Windows 7 but slightly faster boot times. But ZDNet reporter David Meyer disagreed with that performance assessment after running Jolicloud on a Nokia Booklet 3G in order to take advantage of that device's unusual 720p screen resolution. He wrote that the device's \\"lousy Atom Z530 processor...really struggles under Windows 7 Starter Edition [but] flies on Jolicloud....I'm struggling to think of a rival Linux distro that can be so easily picked up and run by an average user\\". In Ars Technica, Ryan Paul wrote that \\"there are a lot of good ideas on display in Jolicloud [now Joli OS] 1.0, but the nascent product still feels incomplete\\". He saw no reason for Linux users, particularly Ubuntu users, to switch. \\"Ubuntu's own Unity environment is more sophisticated and has much better integration between native applications and the underlying platform,\\" though Joli OS might be a better choice for users interested in Web applications. Noting that Joli OS 1.0's foundation is Ubuntu 9.04, which is nearing the end of its support cycle by Canonical, Paul wrote that \\"the real challenge will be continuing to expand the scope of Joli OS's differentiating features while...ensuring that Jolicloud users will benefit from Ubuntu's steady stream of new features\\". Tariq Krim defended the decision to stay with Ubuntu 9.04 in Joli OS 1.0, arguing that later Ubuntu versions have been less stable and have required user-initiated software installations to be fully functional. Examples where Jolicloud developers did additional work to ensure out-of-the-box functionality include support for Poulsbo GMA500 drivers, touchscreens and 3G. He said the company was \\"moving away from Ubuntu to a solution that could fit our user needs better. We are looking closely at what Chrome OS is doing\\". Jolibook In November 2010, Jolicloud shipped a netbook computer, called Jolibook, that ran the operating system out of the box. The computer was manufactured by UK-based Vye Computers and featured a 10.1-inch screen, dual core 1.5 GHz Intel Atom N550, 1GB RAM and a 250GB hard drive. Artwork on the lid included the slogan \\"fast, fun, connected\\". The machine was only available in the United Kingdom, selling for ¬£280 via Shop.VyePC.com and Amazon.co.uk, and is no longer manufactured. Version 1.1 Jolicloud released version 1.1 in December 2010. The new version was based on Ubuntu 10.04 LTS (Lucid), with future patches planned from 10.10 (Maverick). Among the improvements claimed by the company were faster boot times of 10‚Äì20 seconds on most devices tested, 15 percent battery life improvements (tested on a Clevo M1100 netbook with an Intel Atom N450 processor and a three-cell battery) and support for all PCs, not just netbooks. Version 1.2 Version 1.2 was announced in March 2011 and renamed Joli OS. The new version featured a new boot screen, auto and guest mode log-ins, a local file system integrated within the desktop, remote access to the desktop from any HTML5-capable browser, optional background updates, and support for the latest Chromium 10 browser and Flash 10.2. Version 1.2 also includes Dropbox integration, an app creation wizard, and a file browser to access local files, preview Dropbox files and edit using Google Docs. It uses 2.2 GB of disk space when installed.

He was sentenced to death at the restoration of the monarchy, and imprisoned for life. He was author of two religious works.Lee, Sidney (1903), Dictionary of National Biography Index and Epitome, p. 1300 (also main entry lvi 377) Burke's Peerage, page 1436. Berry, Genealogies of Hants, Page 28. Berry, Genealogies of Kent, page 361. Visitation of London, Vol. 2, page 289. Early life and origins Robert Tichborne (1599‚Äì1682) was related to the Tichbornes of Tichborne, near Winchester, Hants. The precise relation is not clear but both lines were descended from Sir John Tichborne (d. 1498) Knight and Sheriff of Hampshire in 1488 & 1496, and (married circa 1465) Margaret Martin, daughter and heiress of Richard Martin of Edenbridge. The line for Chidiock Tichborne is also descended from this couple. The Harleian MS 5800 in the British Library has a handwritten pedigree for the Tichbornes, written 1658 for Robert Tichborne just after he had been Lord Mayor of London (1656‚Äì57) and for his elevation to the Lords by Cromwell. Robert's coat of arms uses the Tichborne coat (vair a chief or) but with a crescent for difference, denoting a second son. The descent is not clear for the first two generations ‚Äì and does not fully match with other contemporary Tichborne genealogies. Working backwards and using additional sources as well, this gives Robert Tichborne's ancestry as: # son of Robert Tichborne (1567‚Äì) and Johanna Banckes, daughter of Thomas Banckes.(Visitation of London, 1633‚Äì4, ii. 289). This Robert's brother was Richard Tichborne of Crippenden, Cowden, Kent ‚Äì a wealthy Iron Foundry owner. # who was second son of John Tichborne (after 1549‚Äì1620) of Cowden and Dorothy Chaloner (b. 1542), daughter of Thomas Chaloner of Lyndfield and Alice Shirley, daughter of Sir Richard Shirley of Wiston. This John's brother Morris, married Jane Chaloner, sister of Dorothy. # who was son of John Tichborne (d. 1556) and Alice Wolffe of Ashington, possibly daughter of Edward Wolffe of manor of Ashinton, W Sussex) # who was second son of Maurice/Morris Tichborne (d. before 1508) and Margaret Courthope (d. 1533), daughter of William Courthope of Heath. This Morris Tichborne was either a younger son of John Tichborne and Margaret Martin ‚Äì or grandson, with two generations in quick succession, through Thomas Tichborne (born between 1470‚Äì1477). This remains a genealogical uncertainty. Early in life Robert Tichborne (1599‚Äì1682) was a linen-draper in London \\"by the little Conduit in Cheapside\\". gives the quotation, but does not cite his source Burke's Peerage, page 1436.

Civil war On the outbreak of the English Civil War Tichborne took up arms for Parliament, and was in 1643 a captain in the Yellow Regiment of the London trained bands. Cites: Dillon, List of the Officers of the London Trained Bands, 1890, p. 8. In February of that year he was one of a deputation from the city who presented a petition to the House of Commons against the proposed treaty with the king. Cites: Report on the Duke of Portland's MSS. i. 95. According to a contemporary critic, he did not distinguish himself as a soldier, and was indeed \\"fitter for a warm bed than to command a regiment\\"; but he was a colonel in 1647, and was appointed by Fairfax in August of that year lieutenant of the Tower. Cites: Rushworth, vii. 761; Clarke Papers, i. 396. Tichborne political views were advanced, as his speeches in the council of the army in 1647 prove; and in religion his printed works show that he was an extreme independent. Cites: Rushworth, i. 396, 404, ii. 256, 258, 262. Regicide On 15 January 1649 Tichborne presented to the House of Commons a petition from London in favour of the execution of the king and the establishment of a republic. Cites: Ludlow, Memoirs, i. 212; The humble petition of the Commons of the City of London ... together with Col. Tichborne's Speech, 1648, 4to. Tichborne was appointed one of the king's judges, signed the death-warrant, and attended every meeting of the court excepting two. Commonwealth On 23 October 1651 parliament selected Tichborne as one of the eight commissioners to settle the government of Scotland and prepare the way for its union with England. Cites: Commons' Journals, vii. 30. On 14 May 1652 he received the thanks of the English Parliament for his services in Scotland. Cites: Commons' Journals. vii. 132. In 1650 he was one of the sheriffs of London. Protectorate Tichborne was one of the representatives of London in the Little Parliament, and was a member of the two councils of state elected by it. Cites: Commons' Journals. In 1651 Tichborne was a Sheriff of the City of London. He is recorded as 'Alderman Tichburne' in attendance at the Whitehall Conference in 1655, representing the interests of merchants in discussing the readmission of Jews into England. The merchants were broadly opposed to readmission. In 1656, he was elected Lord Mayor of London. Cites: London's Triumph, or the solemn reception of Robert Tichborne, Lord Mayor, 29 October 1656, 4to. The Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell knighted him on 15 December 1655 and summoned him to his House of Lords in December 1657. On 17 April 1658 Tichborne, who was colonel of the Yellow Regiment and a member of the London Militia Committee, presented an address from the London trained bands to the Lord Protector (Mercurius Politicus, 15‚Äì22 April 1658). An unflattering character of Tichborne was given in \\"A Second Narrative of the late Parliament\\", 1658. Cites: Harl. Miscell. iii. 484. Second Commonwealth After the fall of the house of Cromwell, Tichborne, who was never a member of the Long Parliament, became a person of less importance; but in October 1659, when the army under John Lambert expelled the parliament, he was appointed one of the committee of safety which the army set up, and he was also one of the twenty-one \\"conservators of liberty\\" named by them in December following. Edmund Ludlow wrathfully observes that he \\"had lately moved to set up Richard Cromwell again\\". Cites: Ludlow Memoirs, ii. 131, 149, 173, ed. 1894. The restoration of the Long Parliament at the end of the month put an end to his political career. On 20 April 1660 a warrant was issued for the arrest of Tichborne and Alderman John Ireton, who were regarded as the two pillars of the Good Old Cause in the City of London. They were released four days later on bail. Cites: Cal. State Papers, Dom. 1659‚Äì60, p. 574. Restoration At the Restoration Tichborne surrendered in obedience to the king's proclamation (16 June), though he showed considerable vacillation, withdrawing himself from the custody of the sergeant-at-arms, and then giving himself up once more, Cites: Ludlow, ii. 294; and Kennet, Register, p. 181. and Royalist pamphlets exulted over his imprisonment.

Born Alice Frankl in Prague, she met her future husband, Otto Aufrichtig (stage name Otto Aurich) in 1933 when he took over as director of the Neues Stadttheater in Teplitz-Schonau [Teplice] where she was appearing as a singer, dancer and actress. Their Teplice stage partnership proved to be a winning combination and after marrying in Czechoslovakia, she and Otto moved to his home city of Vienna. With the Nazis rise to power, they curtailed their own success in Vienna and made the decision to move to the Netherlands, where they became members of the Fritz Hirsch Operetta in Den Haag. They were an instant success, staying on with the company until 1938. When they left, it was to become members of a new opera company, the Plaza Theater in the Hollandsche Schouwburg, which had been founded in Amsterdam. They were the stars of the company but their success could not prevent the Plaza Theater from going bankrupt. They immediately bounced back with a new opera company in the Hollandsche Schouwburg in The Capital, led by Otto Frohn Knecht, in which they co-starred with celebrated artists of the period, Sylvain Poons and Kurt Gerron. This, too, was destined not to last. Following German occupation of the Netherlands and the tight restrictions forced upon Jews, the Nazis decreed in November 1941 that the Hollandsche Schouwburg would be renamed the Joodsche Schouwburg [Jewish Theatre], and star Jewish performers no longer permitted to appear before non- Jewish audiences. In March 1939, she and Otto joined the Rudolf Nelson Revue, and it was with Rudolf's piano accompaniment that the pair cut their own recorded titles ‚Äì Die Damenschuhe von Zimmer Nr. 20 (Aurich) and M√§nner, M√§nner, M√§nner! (Frank). These selections made their CD debut exactly 60 years later on the release Und Rudi Macht Musik Dazu. During 1940 and 1941 Lisl appeared in Kabarett der Prominente followed by the Joodsche Schowburg in 1942. The couple were still living in Amsterdam when they were deported by the Nazis to Westerbork concentration camp, where between March and June 1944, they took part in three productions staged by the Westerbork stage troupe, some of whose other members were Max Ehrlich (producer/director), Kurt Gerron, Jetty Cantor, Willi Rosen and Erich Ziegler. She and Otto were subsequently deported from Westerbork to Theresienstadt, then to Auschwitz on 4 October 1944. From Auschwitz, Lisl was among those forced to march to Christianstadt, where she died. Otto survived the war and returned to Amsterdam where he re- established himself as a singer, dancer, choreographer and director of the city's Hoofdstad Operette.

In addition numerous Prussian exclaves were mixed up among the Thuringian states. These were the county (Landkreis) of Schleusingen and town of Suhl, the county of Herrschaft Schmalkalden and Barchfeld, the region around Wandersleben and M√ºhlberg, the county of Ziegenr√ºck and town of Ranis, and the villages of Kamsdorf, Blankenberg, Sparnberg, Blintendorf and Gefell, which belonged to the county of Ziegenr√ºck but were separated from it. Other Prussian exclaves were the villages of Abtl√∂bnitz near Camburg and Kischlitz near Eisenberg. To the east, the Kingdom of Saxony was the neighbouring state, which also had various exclaves. These were Liebschwitz near Gera with the municipalities and lands of Lengefeld, Liebschwitz, Lietzsch, Niebra, P√∂sneck, and Taubenpreskeln, as well as the neighbouring municipalities of Hilbersdorf, Loitzsch, R√ºckersdorf, Thonhausen and Grobsdorf. Also worth mentioning are the municipality of Bocka near Altenburg and Kauritz near Meerane. The Kleinstaaterei was highly valued, but on the territory of the present Free State of Thuringia in the early 20th century there were eight small states (Kleinstaaten), Prussian areas in several provinces (Regierungsbezirken) and several small Saxon exclaves. The fragmentation of the states was made particularly acute because the little states did not form single enclosed territories, but were scattered in a confusing melange. In 1913 there was an exchange of land between Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach and Saxe-Meiningen. The Meiningen village of Lichtenhain outside Jena was exchanged for parts of Kranichfeld that belonged to Weimar. In principle less sensible: it did lead to a tidying up of the boundaries in Kranichfeld, but the Meiningen exclave of Kranichfeld was not removed, but enlarged. Apparently Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach could not or would not offer other land for exchange.  History  During the period of the German Empire the Thuringian states each had a voice in the Bundesrat - in all eight votes (the duchies of Coburg and Gotha only had a joint vote). They thus formed a significant block, especially when one considers that the Kingdom of Saxony, for example, only had four votes. However the Thuringian states rarely agreed with one another. Until 1903 only five states were represented by the Weimar delegates in the Bundesrat. Saxe- Coburg and Gotha had its own delegate, Saxe-Meiningen was represented by Bavaria and Reuss Elder Line by Mecklenburg-Schwerin. The Higher Regional Court (Oberlandesgericht) of Jena was, according to the new Imperial Court Constitution Act (Reichsgerichtsverfassungsgesetz) of 1 October 1878 the only institution, that was responsible for all the Thuringian states. Only Schwarzburg-Sondershausen fell under the jurisdiction of the Oberlandesgericht in Naumburg. A second common institution was the University of Jena with the Ernestine duchies as their sponsor states. From 1817 the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg was no longer part of them. In November 1918 the centuries-long, territorial fragmentation of the Thuringian region came to an end. In the federal states, as in the whole of the German Empire, the republic was declared and the reigning dukes and princes abdicated. The old Thuringian duchies and principalities became free states. The two free states of Reuss E.L. and Reuss Y.L. merged on 21 December 1918 to form the Republic of Reuss, the union between Saxe-Gotha and Saxe-Coburg was dissolved on 12 April 1919 and they formed their own free states. The governments of Saxe-Altenburg, Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Saxe-Gotha, Saxe-Meiningen, Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, Schwarzburg- Rudolstadt, Schwarzburg-Sondershausen and the Republic of Reuss took part in negotiations about a merger of all Thuringian states, if possible including the Prussian elements. But because Prussia was not prepared for any kind of land exchange, the founding of the state as a so-called \\"Little Thuringian Solution\\" was taken forward. In the course of the foundation discussions the state governments voiced misgivings from Saxe-Meiningen and Coburg as to whether being annexed by the new state would be advantageous for them, because the Franconian-influenced region south of the Rennsteig path had always been more strongly linked to Bavaria, both linguistically and socially. For this reason on 30 November 1919 in Saxe-Coburg a plebiscite was held in which the majority of the people voted against being merged into the state of Thuringia. The misgivings of Saxe-Meiningen were resolved inter alia by a \\"guarantee of existence\\" (Bestandsgarantie) for the IHK Sonneberg and for the counties. On 1 May 1920 the Free State of Thuringia was founded with its capital at Weimar. This excluded the Free State of Coburg which was united with the Free State of Bavaria on 1 July 1920. The region of the Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Thuringia corresponds, even today, apart from a few small Prussian enclaves, to the boundaries of the State of Thuringia in 1920. Only the exclave of Ostheim, which used to belong to Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach went to the Evangelical- Lutheran Church in Bavaria in 1972, in line with the political situation of the time.

It is distinguished from involuntary slavery where an individual is forced to a period of servitude usually as punishment for a crime. In practice, however, the term is often a euphemism used to hide conditions of slavery which are, in fact, less than completely voluntary.  Origin  Some believe that in ancient times, this was a common way for impoverished people to provide subsistence for themselves or their family and provision was made for this in law. For example, the code of Hammurabi stated that \\"besides being able to borrow on personal security, an individual might sell himself or a family member into slavery\\". However, according to a different translation, \\"If any one fail to meet a claim for debt, and sell himself, his wife, his son, and daughter for money or give them away to forced labor: they shall work for three years in the house of the man who bought them, or the proprietor, and in the fourth year they shall be set free.\\" This may be interpreted to mean that rather than people voluntary selling themselves into slavery in return for a loan, slavery was simply the standard penalty for failure to pay off a debt. Other parts of the Code of Hammurabi show both debt and slavery as being part of the criminal justice system of the time, such as, \\"If any one be too lazy to keep his dam in proper condition, and does not so keep it; if then the dam break and all the fields be flooded, then shall he in whose dam the break occurred be sold for money, and the money shall replace the corn which he has caused to be ruined.\\" According to some sources, in ancient times, one of the most direct ways to become a Roman or Greek citizen was by means of a self-sale contract. The laws surrounding Roman and Greek manumission made it quite possible for such erstwhile slaves to then become citizens or near-citizens themselves.The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia. Geoffrey W. Bromiley. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1995. . p.543. However, according to Walter Scheidel, while it is possible that some genuine self-sales may have occurred in ancient Rome, the quantitative weight of such events would have been minimal. In ancient Greece, a form of voluntary slavery was associated with pederasty. Here, it was viewed as a component of reciprocal relationship wherein lovers consider voluntary servitude as legitimate, particularly in the effort to honorably satisfy the beloved in the pursuit of virtue. Voluntary servitude in this case was integral in the practice of education. In medieval Russia, self-sale was the main source of slaves. However, as two of the reasons for self-sale in Russian history were avoidance of the military draft and avoidance of poll taxes, also known as soul taxes, it is questionable how voluntary this sort of slavery really was. The presence of a contract does not mean that a person entered into the condition of forced labor voluntarily. For example, a report by Dr. Raingeard, speaking of the Belgian Congo, states that, \\"When a native, remarkably enough, managed to resist the threats and blows of the merchants, I have seen government officers offering him the choice between signing a contract and prison.\\" According to Kevin Bales, \\"It may be that local custom and culture support slavery and that most of the population knows of its existence, but admitting it is something else again. Here false contracts conceal slavery. Slaveholders can easily force their slaves to sign anything: mortgages, loan agreements, indentures, or labor contracts. If questions are raised, signed contracts are produced and corrupt law enforcement looks the other way. Even in countries with mostly honest and conscientious police, the contracts hide slavery.\\" Even where a worker did voluntarily agree to something, the conditions at the place of work may be different from that which he agreed to. Additionally, even if only one worker agrees to something, members of his family and his descendants may be forced to comply as well. For example, some workers in Pakistan agree to make bricks in return for an advance on their paycheck under a system known as peshgi. However, once there, the kiln owner may begin to molest and even rape women of their family. Many workers feel that an assault on the women of their family voids any work agreement they might have. Accounting of the debt is often dishonest. Children may be kidnapped and held captive if the slaveholder believes the family likely to flee. The debt is frequently passed on from one generation to the next. Modern analysis Jean-Jacques Rousseau contends that in a contract of self- enslavement, there is no mutuality. The slave loses all. The contract negates his interests and his rights. It is entirely to his disadvantage. Since the slave loses his status as a moral agent once the slave contract is enforced, the slave cannot act to enforce anything owed to him by his master. Rousseau contrasted this to the social contract, in that the subjects of the government have control over their masters. John Stuart Mill wrote a critique of voluntary slavery as a criticism of paternalism. The term voluntary slavery is often used in polemical writings and rhetoric on a range of subjects. For instance, it has been asserted that the capitalist wage system amounts to voluntary slavery and is contrary to human dignity and inalienable human rights. Libertarian Murray Rothbard criticized the term as self-contradictory. Utilitarian and consumer advocate Nick Carducci criticizes Rothbard's requirement of \\"slavery\\" to be involuntary. \\"Voluntary slavery,\\" although voluntary, exists whenever the contract requirements are impossible or is to be made impossible by the punishment. Further, he concludes common contract law can only enforce the splitting of spoils as to not enter a state of impossibility due upon the requited consent of the parties to the contract exclusively, since all impossibilities are obviously non-observable and cannot ever be foreseen.

Character History=1983-1989= Mindy Lewis, lovingly called \\"Princess\\" by her beloved daddy, Billy, grew up in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Mindy, whose mother died when she was only five years old, grew up spoiled and rich. Mindy came to Springfield in June 1983, with her father following very soon after. Mindy was instrumental in convincing Billy to marry Vanessa Chamberlain, whom she adored. She then started dating Phillip Spaulding, but the heir to Spaulding millions didn't pay enough attention to her, so Mindy, in a ploy for attention, made it look like her horse, Boss, trampled her and landed herself in Cedars Hospital. Her roommate was Beth Raines and their new friendship set in motion the friendship between Rick, Phillip, Beth and Mindy that would henceforth be referred to as The Four Musketeers. Phillip and Rick were both smitten with Beth, but Phillip backed off and continued to date Mindy. When Mindy accidentally heard Justin and Alan talking about Phillip being not Alan's but Justin's son, she told Rick, while Beth's stepfather, Bradley Raines heard every word. Meanwhile, Phillip and Rick planned a surprise party for Mindy on her 18th birthday at the Country Club and, while everyone was congratulating Mindy at the party, Phillip confronted Alan and Justin about his parentage (Bradley Raines had told him the truth). Later, when Beth told Mindy that Phillip was about to leave town, Mindy visited him and told him that she wanted to go with him and the pair made love for the first time. However, Mindy didn't really want to go anywhere and, to keep Phillip in town, she asked Beth to convince him to stay. While Mindy begged Rick not to tell Phillip that she had known the truth before him, Alan did and, as a result, Phillip left Mindy during a conversation at Cedars. Mindy vowed to herself to win Phillip back, and one day, she and Rick witnessed Beth and Phillip confessing their love for each other at the stables. Angry, when Mindy learned that Phillip had arranged for Beth to have a secret room at the stables where she could draw paintings, she spitefully leaked this info to Bradley. Bradley took action by threatening Phillip and raping Beth. Later, when Mindy realized Bradley's true nature, she confessed her schemes to Rick and warned Alan about Bradley. At this time, Beth left Phillip and Mindy used this to her advantage by comforting Phillip and sleeping with him again. This time, she didn't take her birth-control pills. Soon after, when Beth and Phillip ran off to New York, Mindy and Rick followed and formed a bond while working at Circus Underground. In New York, a sidewalk Santa named Nick assisted Rick and Mindy in their search after Rick saved Nick's life from a heart attack. When Trudy, Rick and Mindy's boss, bought one of Beth's drawings‚Äîa portrait of Phillip as a clown‚Äîfor $20, the picture led Rick and Mindy to right to Phillip and Beth. By January 1984, the group was back in Springfield and Mindy had fallen in love with Rick. Mindy discovered that she was pregnant by Phillip. Mindy told Rick the truth and he told Ed and Maureen while Mindy told her stepmother, Vanessa, and swore her to secrecy. Meanwhile, Phillip and Beth made plans for their February wedding. After Mindy changed her mind about having an abortion, Rick decided that the baby needed a father so he proposed but Mindy turned him down by saying that they were too young and not ready for marriage. Rick told Billy that he wanted to marry Mindy but Billy agreed that the pair wasn't ready. When Rick announced that they HAD to get married since there was a baby involved, a furious Billy went to Ed and yelled at him for not keeping a closer eye on Rick. Ed shot back that Phillip was the father, not Rick. Billy went to the church where Beth and Phillip were about to be married and confronted Mindy about Phillip being the father of her baby. Mindy was forced to confess the truth. Unfortunately, Beth was standing nearby and overheard and left Phillip at the altar. Meanwhile, Phillip wanted to be part of the baby's life but Mindy would only permit this if he married her. Though Phillip agreed, the marriage would dissolve, when Mindy miscarried the baby. Afterwards, Mindy became attracted to Lujack Luvonaczek, who only had eyes for Beth. So once again Mindy was thrown over for the sweet Beth. In the meantime, Rick became involved with Roxie Shayne, Mindy's old rival from Tulsa and a jealous Mindy brought Roxie's abusive boyfriend Dub Taylor to town to break them up. When Dub revealed that Mindy had brought him there, Rick was appalled and grew closer to Roxie. In 1985, Mindy turned to shady Kyle Sampson for comfort. However, Kyle was only using Mindy to get information about Billy in order to take over Lewis Oil. When Mindy found out about his vendetta against her father, Mindy got drunk and shot Kyle in his arm. Not long after, Kyle invited the Lewises to a family dinner and, still under pressure, Mindy broke down and confessed to everyone what she'd done to Kyle. To her surprise, Kyle protected her. In the meantime, when Kyle's assistant, David Preston, kidnapped Kyle and demanded $10 million, he hid the money in a juke box but Mindy found it and kept it for her own since she felt it justified all the pain Kyle caused her family. Later, Mindy was exposed and she was forced to return the money. About this time, Mindy began working at Company with Roxie and Roxie's boyfriend from Alaska, Kurt Corday. When Mindy fell in love with Kurt and planned to marry him, a jealous Rick alerted the authorities that Kurt was an illegal alien from Canada. To save Kurt from being deported, Roxie, who had married Kurt in Alaska when she was suffering from amnesia, crashed Kurt and Mindy's wedding and married Kurt herself to keep him in the country. The marriage was quickly annulled. Soon after, Billy demanded that Kurt properly propose to Mindy and give the engagement some time before having a proper wedding. Later in the spring of 1985, June, Warren Andrews opened up a new nightclub, the Blue Orchid. After Kurt asked her to marry him, Mindy, who loved the ambience of the Blue Orchid, suggested that they have a lavish wedding there. Kurt agreed and the date was for November 1985. Mindy and Kurt had a grand wedding, with Mindy in a gorgeous gown and veil and Kurt in a tuxedo with a white coat and golden pants and white gloves, and Billy gave Mindy away. At the reception, tragedy struck when Billy, who unbeknownst to everyone had been brainwashed by the Largo Organization, pulled a gun and aimed it at Kyle! When her grandfather, H.B., called out Billy's name in the ensuing melee, David Preston was shot instead! Billy looked about to be convicted, until at the 11th hour, Suzette Saxon confessed to shooting and killing David Preston. Later, In January 1986, Kyle started a new campaign with Jackson Freemont's help to start a new cosmetics line. Kyle, on Jackson's and Beth's advice, decided to have a beauty contest to name the new \\"Sampson Girl\\" who would advertise the cosmetics. Rivals Mindy Lewis, Roxie Shayne and Jessie Matthews all vied for the competition to be the \\"Sampson Girl.\\". As with most beauty contests, there was much backstabbing, nailbiting and a little bit of backstage intrigue. Jackson prematurely created a victory poster for Beth, whom he was falling in love with. Kyle threatened Roxie about her past as a prostitute, after her father, Hawk Shayne, threatened to blackmail Kyle over his illegal ownership of Reva's former house, Reva Bend, Roxie dropped out prematurely from the contest. Mindy used her ability to sell her sexy looks to sway the votes of the judges, much to Kurt's chagrin, and the voting was close with Mindy winning the contest and being named \\"Sampson Girl\\". However, Mindy had more to lose‚Äînamely, her marriage. As the \\"Sampson Girl,\\" she traveled, schmoozed and interviewed with the likes of Dick Cavett, while hubby Kurt was busy building their dream house and keeping Company running smoothly. Kurt looked forward to the day when Mindy would become a full-time wife and they could start a family. Kurt was blissfully unaware that Jackson had talked Mindy into signing a no-pregnancy clause for the next five years. Things came to a halt though when Alexandra Spaulding and Hawk Shayne, out of a mutual enmity towards Kyle, fabricated evidence that the \\"Sampson Girl\\" contest was a fraud and Mindy's name was mud. Mindy went to the construction site of the new house, where she found Kurt and Roxie asleep in each other's arms! Mindy didn't know Roxie had been helping Kurt with the house, and they had varnished themselves into a corner and had to remain there until the varnish dried. Jealous and angry, Mindy beat a hasty exit, knocking over a kerosene lamp in the process. A fire broke out, and Hawk risked his life to save Roxie and Kurt. The house was destroyed and since Hawk realized it was Mindy's fault, he blackmailed her for money for his silence. Eventually, Mindy soon realized she couldn't play housewife to a traditional, working-class husband and admitted to starting the fire. Afterwards, a disillusioned Kurt left to work on a Lewis Oil rig off the coast of Venezuela. Although Kurt had plans to return and to build another house with Mindy, tragically, he was killed in an explosion. Grieving over Kurt's death, Mindy went to Cross Creek for some rest but was kidnapped and taken to a stable by a criminal named Pierce who wanted her Uncle Josh dead. Ironically, he was also member of an organization called Diamondhead who wanted to take over Lewis Oil and was also responsible for Kurt's death! Josh and Reva didn't know about Mindy's kidnapping until Pierce kidnapped them as well. Luckily, Mindy ended up saving Josh and Reva by hitting Pierce with a board, sending him falling into a wildcat pit where he broke his neck. With help of Reva's little brother Rusty, whom Mindy never liked, an employee at Lewis Oil, Cat Brixton, was found to be a member of the organization and in 1987 he kidnapped Mindy and Roxie. When Cat was abusive to Mindy, Roxie saved her by attacking Cat but she had no chance and Cat beat her up until Rusty arrived to rescue them. While Roxie was injured in Cedars, Mindy realized her good nature and finally befriended her old rival. With the organization destroyed, Mindy's next chance at love was with Rusty. Later, Rusty would arrest drug user Rose McLaren and he and Mindy helped her. Unfortunately, Rusty fell in love with Rose and he and Mindy broke up in 1988. After an unsuccessful relationship with Frank Cooper, Mindy became involved with Will Jeffries, Josh's best friend who had amnesia and they impulsively married with H.B.'s blessing. Later, Will was kidnapped by Rusty, Josh and Reva prevented Mindy from seeing him. Confused, Mindy visited Billy and finally learned about Will's villainous nature. Desperate to get her back, in 1989, Will kidnapped Mindy's cousin Marah and left her with his unstable mother. About this time, Rusty's new wife, Rose, was killed. After attending Josh and Reva's wedding at Cross Creek, Mindy returned to Springfield but, to everyone's shock, she claimed that she still loved Will and even moved back in with him. Not long after, Will had the feeling that the late Rose was stalking him; he even saw her and heard her voice on the answering machine. Will almost went crazy, while Rusty realized Mindy's games. Confronted, Mindy confessed to Rusty that she was gaslighting Will to get him to confess to Rose's murder. Rusty teamed up with Mindy and they found a dead ringer for Rose named Ann and Ann unwillingly agreed to help them by pretending to be Rose. Meanwhile, Will suddenly surprised Mindy by planning to go on a honeymoon to the hills with her. Something in his attitude startled her and Mindy suddenly realized that Will had figured out that she was gaslighting him. Will then drugged her, holding her at gunpoint at an hotel in the hills. He left a note saying \\"the game is over\\" and told Mindy that if they weren't meant to be together on earth, then they would be in death. Meanwhile, Rusty, Sonni Carrerra and Josh rushed to save Mindy and, after Sonni found Mindy drugged, Rusty climbed on the balcony, whereupon Will confessed to Sonni all his crimes. As Will was about to jump over the balcony with Mindy, Rusty shot him and Will fell to his death, while Josh was able to save Mindy. Now lying unconscious in Cedars, Mindy had a vision of Kurt and Rose who convinced her to hold onto her life. Soon after, Rusty and Mindy became closer again but when Rusty was offered a job as the chief of detective's in Tulsa, Mindy didn't want to follow him, so he left Springfield alone. In the meantime, the Lewis family was rocked to discover that Billy had a son, Dylan, from a one-night stand with Reva Shayne. Although Mindy was, initially, jealous of the attention Billy gave his new son, in time she and Dylan formed a close relationship. =1990-1997= In 1990, Mindy decided venture out on her own by becoming a fashion designer, which didn't sit well with Billy because he had problems dealing with the fact that his \\"princess\\" had grown up. Later, Billy asked Mindy to spy on his nemesis, Roger Thorpe, but when Mindy did so, she fell in love with Roger despite the fact that he was married to Alexandra Spaualding. After Roger lost the Waterview Towers to Billy, Mindy let herself be seduced by him and they started a secret affair, while Mindy fell for Roger's claims that he would leave Alex for her. In the meantime, Mindy resumed her relationship with Rick. At about the same time, Mindy was shocked to learn that Phillip was on trial for Neil's murder. To Mindy's grief, Phillip then apparently died in a car accident. Later, a man named Mallet saved Mindy from a nosy reporter trying to push his way into her apartment. Mallet claimed to be writing a book about Phillip and Mindy befriended him. Soon, she learned that Mallet was actually a cop who wanted to find Phillip alive and, through the listening device that he planted in Mindy's apartment, Mallet learned of her affair with Roger. Not long after, Rick asked Mindy to marry him but, still holding out for Roger, Mindy turned him down. When it became clear that Roger wasn't going to divorce Alex, Mindy regretted the affair and tried to rekindle her romance with Rick. Unfortunately, she was too late since Rick was now married to Beth, so Mindy let herself be comforted by Mallet. Though she thought about having a future with Mallet, she still wasn't able to leave Roger. Later, Mindy was shocked to learn that Phillip was indeed alive and had faked his death with Beth and Rick's help. As a result, she felt insulted because she was the only of the \\"Four Musketeers\\" who hadn't known the truth. As 1991 began, Mindy was still carrying on with Roger and became pregnant. Tragically, the stress of keeping their affair a secret became too much for Mindy and she miscarried in May. Unfortunately, the night she lost the baby, Roger was too wrapped up in his own life‚Äîmainly the revelation that Hart Jessup was his son. Disillusioned, Mindy ended her relationship with Roger for good. Mindy's worst nightmare was Billy finding out everything. That seemed a possibility when Alexandra told Mindy that she found Mindy's earring at the Spaulding mansion. Alex threatened to publicly announce the affair if Mindy ever hurt her again. Afterwards, Mindy went to New York and almost fainted when she saw a man named Nick McHenry, since he was the spitting image of Alexandra's deceased son, Lujack. Intrigued, Mindy spoke with Nick about his double and the two shared a few dates. After a shocked Nick found a photo of Lujack, he followed Mindy to Springfield to see what he could find out about his double. As the weeks wore on, it became evident that Nick could be Lujack's twin brother, hence, Alex's son. Alex soon became obsessed with Nick and Mindy warned him that Alex wouldn't give up until she got him. Later, Nick went back to New York for a job and, although Mindy didn't want to follow him, she changed her mind but missed the plane. To Mindy's delight, Nick returned since Alex had sabotaged his job offer to keep him in town. Afterwards, Mindy and Nick made love for the first time in the lighthouse. Unfortunately, Alex caught them and kept her promise by publicly humiliating Mindy and revealing her affair with Roger. Billy beat up Roger and disowned Mindy. but later forgave her with the intervention of H.B. As for Nick, he stood by Mindy and they became engaged in February 1992. By this time the evidence was growing that Nick could be a Spaulding when Alex's old lover, Eric Luvonaczek, arrived and claimed to be Nick's father. Nick still refused to believe it and, after Mindy pleaded with him, Eric confessed that he lied because Alex paid him to and left town. However, later, Eric confessed to Mindy in a letter that Nick was in fact a Spaulding and he let her decide if she would tell Nick the truth. Mindy kept quiet and, after finding a photo of Nick's adoptive-mother Mary McHenry just before Nick's birth that showed she was definitely not pregnant, she erased the date on it with to protect Nick from the truth. Meanwhile, Eric had left a blood sample in Cedars for a DNA test and, to Mindy's shock, Nick agreed to do the test to get rid of Alex. Scared that Alex would do everything in her power to break them up, a desperate Mindy broke into Cedars and changed the results to show that Alex was not Nick's mother. At this point, Roger wanted to make peace with Mindy and although she refused at first, she changed her mind when Roger publicly turned against the Spauldings. In addition, Mindy wanted to get pregnant by Nick but didn't succeed. One day at the beach, Mindy met an unknown woman and befriended her, and saw the same woman again on a party at the Blue Moon. Mindy learned that the woman was an old friend's of Nick from Cambrai named Eve Guthrie. In the meantime, Mindy got a letter from Eric who wanted to come to Mindy and Nick's wedding since he thought that Mindy had told Nick the truth. A panicked Mindy burned the letter but Dylan caught her and tried to get her to tell Nick everything. Mindy scratched the white out off Mary's photo to get the date back, but just as she was about to tell Nick the truth, Eve interrupted and convinced Nick to go to Cambrai to save her husband, Paul. Finally, on the day of their wedding, Nick didn't show up and Alex confronted Mindy and convinced Mindy that Nick had left her to be with Eric in Paris because he'd learned about her schemes. Alex also had Mary's photo and since the Spaulding Jet returned without Nick, Mindy thought that he'd left her. Unable to face him, Mindy wrote Nick a letter in which she confessed everything, she returned her engagement ring in the envelope and left Springfield without a trace. At the end of the year, Dylan went to New York with his girlfriend, Julie Camaletti, and, on New Year's 1993, he met with Mindy who was now working for a designer named Matt Weiss. Though Mindy refused to come home, she relented after quitting her job after an argument with Weiss. Back in town, Mindy was relieved to learn that Alex had left. Believing she might still have a chance with Nick, Mindy rushed to the boathouse and was shocked to see him with Eve. After they were finally able to talk, a few days later, Mindy confessed that she wanted to get him back but Nick was committed to Eve. Later, Nick informed Mindy that the reason he was late for their wedding was because Roger had Nick arrested in Cambrai. Convinced that she'd lost Nick, Mindy did her best to keep her distance but substances threw them together at every turn. Finally, although Nick was still angry at Mindy, he kissed her one evening in the club, only to make her clear that Eve belonged in his life now. Then one day, Mindy threw a party at the lighthouse with Nick and Eve attending and after the party, Mindy was shocked to find all pictures of her and Nick destroyed in her bedroom. She immediately blamed Eve for the crime but Eve denied it and they both blamed each other of being crazy. Unfortunately, Nick stood by Eve and Eve continued to harass Mindy by telling her that, unlike Mindy, she was able to bear Nick's kids. In response, an angry Mindy threw a bucket at Eve but Eve told Nick a different story and Nick believed Eve's claims that Mindy smashed Eve's windshield with her own shovel. As a result, a hurt Mindy wanted nothing more to do with Nick. Not long after, Mindy organized a bridal fashion show to mark her return as a designer and the show was a big success. However, while driving home with Bill, Mindy suddenly passed out and drove her car into the tree. Luckily, both were unhurt and, although alcohol was found in her blood, Mindy knew that she had only drunk water. Meanwhile, Nick had left Eve but soon returned to her, to Mindy's dismay. However, Nick only went back to Eve in an effort to help Mindy because Nick himself had come to the realization that Eve was obsessed with Mindy and needed help. Eve acted and dressed like Mindy and had broken into Mindy's medical records as well. In fact, Eve was the one who had drugged Mindy's bottle of water and manipulated her blood results so that alcohol would be found. Unfortunately, Eve overheard Nick telling Mindy the truth and went crazy. One evening during a storm, Eve hid in Mindy's closet and when she was about to cut the hair off a sleeping Mindy, Mindy woke up and Eve knocked her out during their fight. Nick, who was searching for Eve, found Mindy but Eve injected with a drug and threatened to jump off the observation deck, until Ed Bauer talked her down. Now Eve went to a psychiatric center for treatment and Mindy, at Ed's urging, didn't press charges against her. Though Mindy no longer believed in a future with Nick, after a few weeks, they reunited. After Eve was released from the sanatorium, Nick caught Mindy's ire by trying to help Eve start a new life. Mindy still saw Eve as a threat in their lives and Nick's willingness to help her lead to many arguments until Nick decided they should separate for a while. At the same time, Mindy befriended cop Macauley \\"Mac\\" West, who had once investigated the murder of a man named Davenport for which an innocent David Grant had been imprisoned. Since David was now wanted for the murder of Vinnie Morrison, Nick investigated to help David while he warned Mindy about Mac. Mindy was certain that Nick was only jealous until she learned that Mac was apparently in touch with Vinnie's uncle who wanted avenge for Vinnie's murder. As a result, Mindy cooperated with Nick to get information against Mac, even helping Nick to break into Mac's apartment. In the end, it was discovered that Mac was covering for his old girlfriend, Norrie Ryan.. After Nick found Norrie and the police finally resolved the case, Mac confessed to Mindy that he had fallen in love with her and asked her to move with him to Chicago but Mindy refused. After Mac left, Mindy and Nick reunited. Not long after, Alex returned to town. Although they still couldn't stand each other, Mindy tried to make peace with Alex for Nick's sake and let her stay at the boat house since Alex was homeless after Jenna Bradshaw and Roger had taken over Spaulding. Not long after, Mindy and Nick got engaged and Alex apparently accepted it. Although Alex did attend Mindy and Nick's engagement party at the Country Club, she made a public scene by provoking and arguing with Roger. That same night, Roger would be shot. The police, and Mindy, believed that Alex had shot Roger. Mindy was, especially, convinced since she knew that Alex had had blood on her dress. In January 1994, Mindy lost her home, the lighthouse, after a killer named Ray had started a fire there to kill her friend Tangie Hill and Bill (but Josh saved them). As a result, Mindy and Nick had to move into the Spaulding house. In addition, Alex gave Nick Jenna's half of WSPR. Mindy disapproved of Alex's influence at Nick and she and Alex continued to argue. Meanwhile, to Mindy's shock, Billy was suddenly arrested for the attempted murder of Roger. Later, Nick showed Mindy Billy's weapon that he had found in Mindy's bag and Mindy was shocked to learn that Billy had started drinking again, a fact Nick had known already. Mindy was also shock to learn that Beth knew too, and Mindy was now at a cross-roads with her best friend. Later, the Lewis family was shocked when Billy confessed to shooting Roger to prevent him of taking away his adoptive-son Peter. Mindy tearfully said good-bye to her daddy and she and Nick finally became husband and wife. While dealing with living at the Spaulding mansion with Alexandra, Mindy also had to deal with the custody trial between Vanessa and Bridget for Peter Lewis. Upset that Vanessa divorced Billy to have a better chance at getting custody of her adoptive son, Mindy, nonetheless, supported Vanessa by breaking into Ross Marler's office to steal papers regarding the custody case. Later, to everyone's delight, Vanessa and Bridget finally agreed to share custody of Peter. In the meantime, Mindy and Alex's relationship continued to be strained and, after Mindy returned from a business trip to Milan, she talked Nick into letting Dylan build them their own house. Meanwhile, Mindy felt neglected by Nick because of his job at Spaulding and decided that they should adopt a baby. In the meantime, Mindy became concerned that corporate intrigue at Spaulding had changed Nick. Soon the marriage became strained and Mindy moved out. Finally, in 1995, the adoption agency wrote that the couple had been approved to adopt a little girl. Although Mindy was still insecure of her future with Nick, she agreed to have the baby and moved back to the Spaulding house with him, this time surprisingly with Alex urging Nick to fight to keep the marriage together. Unfortunately, Mindy became obsessed by the preparation for the baby. Nick noticed this and lied to Mindy that there case had been rejected after a case worker visit. Brokenhearted, Mindy confessed to Nick that she had only returned to him because of the baby and that she no longer loved him. Later, Mindy asked the case worker, Mrs. DeWitt, why they were rejected and was shocked to learn that Nick himself had called her off. Although angry, Mindy realized that it was the best this way and she and Nick officially parted ways but remained friends. Some months later, Eve died of a fatal illness and Rick confessed to Mindy that Ed actually turned off her life support machines and he was covering for him. Shocked, Mindy feared that she'd be called to testify and left Springfield to start a new life in Paris. In 1997, Mindy briefly returned to Springfield, along with most of the Lewis family, to mourn their beloved HB. She also reunited with Billy, for the first time after his release from prison, and gave him advice on his feelings for Cassie Layne before returning to France. Mindy was occasionally mentioned by longtime friends Phillip and Rick, and was credited with Marah's makeover when Marah came back from a Paris visit in 1999. =2002-2009= After an absence of 5 years, Mindy came back for a brief visit, in 2002, to attend Josh and Reva's third wedding. There she shared a bittersweet dance with old flame Frank. While in town, she also met Rick's new bride, Mel, and participated in a long-overdue Four Musketeers reunion at Rick's hospital bedside. Later that year, Mindy returned again and, after checking in with brother Bill and being shocked by his relationship with Beth, she revealed that she was in town to attend, along with all of Phillip's other ex-wives, the board meeting to determine whether Alexandra or Alan would control Spaulding Enterprises. As she and Phillip had remained close over the years, he was surprised when she voted for Alex, but understood when he realized that Alex had been blackmailing her with compromising photographs. After saying goodbye to Phillip, Mindy left after giving a final warning to all the other exes to never trust Alex under any circumstances. In 2004, Mindy contacted Marah with fantastic news. Apparently, Mindy showed some designers in Paris Marah's designs and one of them was interested in hiring her. Ecstatic, Marah accepted Mindy's offer to stay with her in Paris. Later that year, Mindy returned to Springfield for a solemn occasion‚ÄîPhillip's funeral. With the Four Musketeers down to three, Mindy, Rick and Beth reminisced about the Phillip they knew and loved, not the ruthless man that he became just prior to his death. While in town, Mindy clashed with her sister-in-law, Olivia Spencer, when a tipsy Olivia, another one of Phillip's ex-wives, starting making disparaging remarks about Phillip. In 2009, Mindy returned to Springfield for her high school reunion. By this point, Phillip had returned to town and was back to his old self. At the reunion, Mindy announced that they were going to recreate a moment from their class and had Philip and Beth crowned King and Queen of the Prom. Though both Rick and Mindy wondered if Phillip was truly alright, they continued to treat him as a friend‚Äîsomething that Phillip noticed and thanked them for. Mindy returned again to town to attend the annual Bauer BBQ and Bill's wedding to Phillip's daughter, Lizzie. Months later, Mindy returned for another very happy occasion‚ÄîBilly's marriage to Vanessa. At the wedding, Mindy thrilled Billy with the news that she was moving to Springfield permanently. By the following year, Mindy was celebrating her own wedding to one of her oldest and dearest friends‚ÄîRick.

Early years Laos and the Soviet Union established diplomatic relations on 7 October 1960. The Laotian representative in France was accredited to the Soviet Union, and the Ambassador of the Soviet Union to Cambodia was accredited to Laos. Socialist construction in Laos With the victory of the Pathet Lao, Laos and the Soviet Union developed close links between each other. Soviet aid workers substituted American aid workers as the political realities in Laos shifted. Laos clearly recognized the Soviet position as the leading force in the Socialist Bloc. The two states began exchanging a wide stream of state, party, army, youth and friendship delegations. Moreover, the Soviet Union contributed to the build-up of the Laotian armed forces.Stuart-Fox, Martin. A History of Laos. Cambridge, U.K.: Cambridge University Press, 1997. pp. 177-178 Final period At its peak, Soviet aid to Laos made up the bulk of the foreign assistance that Laos received. Soviet aid in the 1980s included the presence of some 1,500 technicians and advisers. Many Laotian students studied at Soviet institutions, some 300 Laotian students received scholarships to study in the Soviet Union every year. The Soviet Union also contributed to infrastructure projects, such as the building of roads, airports, bridges, broadcasting facilities and hospitals. The state-to-state assistance also included large deliveries of military materials, such as MiG fighter jets. But in 1989, a gradual reduction of Soviet aid took place.Soviet Union By 1990, the Soviet bilateral external aid to Laos had been reduced to 36% of the total amount of foreign assistance that Laos received in that year. That was a reduction from a previous level of 60%. The number of scholarships for studies in the Soviet Union was drastically reduced as well. Moreover, as the Soviets shifted their focus of their increasingly limited diplomatic leverage in the region towards trying to consolidate cooperation of the other permanent members of the United Nations for the sake of finding a settlement to the Cambodian Civil War, relations with Laos were deprioritzed even further. As the Soviet Union fell apart, Laos began reorienting itself towards developing better relations with its South-East Asian neighbours.

Part of a loess belt stretching along the southeastern rim of the North German Plain, it is noted for its very fertile Chernozem soils.  Boundaries  Topography and location of the Magdeburg B√∂rde The boundaries of the Magdeburg B√∂rde are quite ill-defined. In the west, it borders on the East Brunswick hill country stretching from the Hildesheim B√∂rde in Lower Saxony up to the Hohes Holz forest and the town of Oschersleben on the confluence of the Bode river and the Gro√üer Graben canal. According to the recent editions of the Handbook of the Natural Region Divisions of Germany, the western border north of Oschersleben roughly coincides with the Weser-Elbe watershed along the Druxberge hills. To the northwest, the basin of the Beber river marks the border with the Dr√∂mling nature park near Oebisfelde. To the north, the B√∂rde borders on the Altmark (Letzlingen Heath), being also a part of Saxony-Anhalt; the boundary here is generally reckoned to be coincident with the river Ohre and the Mittelland Canal. In any case, the Flechtingen Hills south of the Ohre only partly belong to the Magdeburg B√∂rde. Its eastern boundary is mainly defined by the Elbe with the Middle Elbe Biosphere Reserve and the lower Saale river, though several villages east of Magdeburg also consider themselves as part of the B√∂rde. Its transition to Mansfeld Land to the southeast is also gradual. While in the south, the lower Bode river downstream of Oschersleben forms the border, the adjacent northern foothills of the Harz mountains, east of the Selke river, are occasionally also considered part of the Magdeburg B√∂rde.  General  The landscape is gently undulating and largely treeless. The underlying terrain mainly comprises loose morainic material from the Saale glaciation period with individual outcrops of older rock. This older bedrock and loose morainic debris is mostly obscured by a covering of wind-blown loess. The area has very fertile soils (partly of black earth), on which sugar beet and wheat are the main crops. In 1934 the soil in the old municipality of Eickendorf (today B√∂rdeland) was given a soil value of 100, which made it the richest soil in Germany, and it was used until the division of Germany in 1945 as a yardstick for the quality of German soils. The Magdeburg B√∂rde lies in the rain shadow of the Harz Mountains and is consequently one of the driest regions of Germany, albeit not the warmest or sunniest. The highest elevation on the Magdeburg B√∂rde is the Gro√üer Wartberg near Niederndodeleben with a height of 145.7 m. Major settlements include Wanzleben, Irxleben, and Egeln, as well as Sta√üfurt and Aschersleben in the northeastern Harz foothills. In the Magdeburg B√∂rde traditionally a variant of the West Low German (Low Saxon) dialect, B√∂rdeplatt, is spoken, though the number of speakers is declining.

NDM is a monogenic (controlled by a single gene) form of diabetes that occurs in the first 6 months of life. Infants do not produce enough insulin, leading to an increase in glucose accumulation. It is a rare disease, occurring in only one in 100,000 to 500,000 live births. NDM can be mistaken for the much more common type 1 diabetes, but type 1 diabetes usually occurs later than the first 6 months of life. There are two types of NDM: permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (PNDM) is a lifelong condition. Transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TNDM) is diabetes that disappears during the infant stage but may reappear later in life. Specific genes that can cause NDM have been identified.Monogenic Forms of Diabetes: Neonatal Diabetes Mellitus and Maturity-onset Diabetes of the Young at National Diabetes Information Clearinghouse, a service of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health. NIH Publication No. 07‚Äì6141. March 2007. Copyright cite: This publication is not copyrighted. The onset of NDM can be caused by abnormal pancreatic development, beta cell dysfunction or accelerated beta cell dysfunction. Individuals with monogenic diabetes can pass it on to their children or future generations. Each gene associated with NDM has a different inheritance pattern.  Symptoms and signs  Common symptoms of NDM includes: * Thirst and Frequent Urination An excessive thirst (also known as polydipsia) and increased urination (also known as polyuria) are common signs of diabetes. An individual with diabetes, have accumulated blood glucose. Their kidneys are working overtime to filter and uptake excess sugar. However, their kidneys cannot keep up, excess sugar is excreted into their urine, and this drag along fluids from the diabetic's tissues. This may lead to more frequent urination and lead to dehydration. As a diabetic individual drinks more fluids to satisfy their thirst, he or she urinates even more. * Dehydration Effected areas of the body are the eyes, mouth, kidneys, heart, and pancreas. Other symptoms of dehydration includes headache, thirst and dry mouth, dizziness, tiredness, and dark colored urine. In severe cases of dehydration in diabetics, low blood pressure, sunken eyes, a weak pulse or rapid heart beat, feeling confused or fatigue. Dehydration and high blood glucose for extended period of time, the diabetic's kidney would try to filter the blood of access glucose and excrete this as urine. As the kidneys are filtering the blood, water is being removed from the blood and would need to be replaced. This leads to an increased thirst when the blood glucose is elevated in a diabetic individual. Water is needed to re-hydrate the body. Therefore, the body would take available from other parts of the body, such as saliva, tears, and from cells of the body. If access water is not available, the body would not be able to pass excess glucose out of the blood by urine and can lead to further dehydration. Severe symptoms of NDM (Deficiency of insulin): * Ketoacidosis Is a diabetic complication that occurs when the body produces high levels of acid in the blood (ketones). This effects the pancreas, fat cells, and kidneys. This condition occurs when the body cannot produce enough insulin. In the absence or lack of insulin, the body of an diabetic individual will break down fat as fuel. This process produces a buildup of acids in the bloodstream known as ketones, in which leads to ketoacidosis if left untreated. The symptoms of ketoacidosis develop rapidly or within 24 hours. Symptoms of ketoacidosis are excessive thirst, frequent urination, nausea or vomiting, stomach pain, tiredness, shortness or fruity smell on breath and confusion. * Intrauterine Growth Restriction A condition in which the unborn baby is smaller than he or she should be, due to the fact he or she not growing at a normal rate in the womb. Delayed growth puts the baby at risk of certain problems during pregnancy, delivery, and after birth. The problems are as follows: baby's birth weight is 90% less than normal weight, difficulty handling vaginal delivery, decreased oxygen levels, hypoglycemia (low blood glucose), low resistance to infection, low Apgar scores (a test given after birth to test the baby's physical condition and evaluate if special medical care is needed), Meconium aspiration (inhaling of stools passed while in the uterus) which causes breathing issues, irregular body temperature and high red blood cell count. * Hyperglycemia A condition characterized as high blood glucose, which occurs when the body has too little insulin or when the body cannot use insulin properly. Hyperglycemia affects the pancreas, kidneys, and body's tissues. Characterization of hyperglycemia is high blood glucose, high levels of sugar in the urine, frequent urination and increase thirst. * Hypoglycemia A condition characterized an extremely low blood glucose, usually less than 70 mg/dL. Areas of the body that are affected, pancreas, kidneys, and mental state.  Cause  Causes of NDM PNDM and TNDM are inherited genetically from the mother or father of the infant. Different genetic inheritance or genetic mutations can lead to different diagnosis of NDM (Permanent or Transient Neonatal Diabetes Mellitus). The following are different types of inheritance or mutations: * Autosomal Dominant: Every cell has two copies of each gene-one gen coming from the mother and one coming from the father. Autosomal dominant inheritance pattern is defined as a mutation that occurs in only one copy of the gene. A parent with the mutation can pass on a copy of the gene and a parent with the mutation can pass on a copy of their working gene (or a copy of their damaged gene). In an autosomal dominant inheritance, a child who has a parent with the mutation has a 50% possibility of inheriting the mutation. * Autosomal Recessive -Autosomal recessive-Generally, every cells have two copies of each gene-one gene is inherited from the mother and one gene is inherited from the father. Autosomal recessive inheritance pattern is defined as a mutation present in both copies if the gene in order for a person to be affected and each parent much pass on a mutated gene for a child to be affected. However, if an infant or child has only one copy, he or she are a carrier of the mutation. If both parents are carriers of the recessive gene mutation, each child have a 25% chance of inheriting the gene. * Spontaneous: A new mutation or change occurs within the gene. * X-linked: When a trait or disease happens in a person who has inherited a mutated gene on the X chromosome (one of the sex chromosome).  Mechanism  Neonatal Diabetes Mellitus (NDM) = Transient Neonatal Diabetes Mellitus (TNDM) = TNDM occurs within the first several days to weeks of an infant's life. Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is commonly seen in affected individuals and defined as poor growth of an unborn baby while in his or her mother's womb. In comparison, of PNDM, the insulin dose requirement of TNDM is often lower. TNDM resolves on its own at an average age of twelve weeks. Although, individuals will relapse in 50% of cases (usually during childhood or young adulthood). The parts of the body that are mostly affected are the pancreas, central nervous system and various tissues of the body. An average of 70% of TNDM is caused by defects initiating over-expression of the father genes in the imprinted region (genes whose expression is dependent on the parent that contributed them) of chromosome 6q24 (Chromosome meaning a string-like structure made of nucleic acid and protein that carries genetic material). There are three mechanism that can cause 6q24-related TNDM, which includes the father's DNA being defected by uniparental isodisomy (UPD) on chromosome 6 and inherited duplication of 6q24 (inherited duplication is a small chromosomal change in which a very little amount of genetic material is copied in chromosome 6). The last possible cause of TNDM, the mother's genes are affected by DNA methylation (DNA methylation is the process in which methyl groups or CH3- are added to the DNA molecule. When a methyl group is located on a promoter, it stops gene transcription). In previous research, it has been observed the involvement of an imprinted gene within TNDM, is only expressed by the father's genetic material or chromosome, resulting in an increased expression of the imprinted gene by UPD or inherited duplication that leads to the onset of diabetes. Numerous defects within the genome can lead to over- expression of the father's defected genes in the chromosome 6q24 region and result in TNDM. However, there are two genes in this region that can be associated with TNDM: ZAC and HYMAI Genes ZAC is a zinc-finger protein that controls apoptosis (programmed cell death) and cell cycle arrest (cell division and duplication of DNA stops when the cell detects cell damage or defects) in PLAG1 (pleomorphic adenoma gene-like 1). PLAG1 is a transcription regulator of the type 1 receptor for pituitary adenylated cyclase-activating polypeptide (is a polypeptide that activates adenylate cyclase and increases the cyclic adenosine monophosphate or cAMP. cAMP is a second messenger that is used for neighboring cells to perform signal transduction in targeted cells), which is important for insulin secretion regulation. The function of the HYMAI (hydatiform mole-associated and imprinted transcript) is unknown. Second, chromosome 6q24-TNDM is caused by over-expression of imprinted genes at 6q24 (PLAGL1 [ZAC] and HYMAI). It was discovered that a differentially methylated region (DMR) is present within the shared promoter of these genes. Generally the expression of the mother's alleles of PLAGL1 and HYMAI are blocked or not expressed by DMR methylation and only the father's alleles of PLAG1 and HYMA1 are expressed. The previously listed genetic mechanisms result in twice the normal amount of these two genes and cause chromosome 6q24 TNDM. ZFP57 Gene Third, mother's hypomethylation defects (a genetic defect that stops the allele from getting a methyl group, which would inhibit transcription) can occur from an isolated genomic imprinting or occur as a defect called, \\"hypomethylation imprinted loci\\" (HIL). HIL is defined as the loss of a methyl group in the 5-methylcytosine nucleotide at a fixed position on a chromosome. Homozygous ( having two of the same alleles) or heterozygous (defined as having one each of two different alleles) ZFP57 pathogenic variant make up almost half of TNDM-HIL, but the other causes of HIL are unknown. Moreover, half of TNDM patients that contain chromosome 6q24-related TNDM experiencing re-occurrence of diabetes during their childhood or young adulthood. The onset of insulin resistance and increased insulin requirements are associated with puberty and pregnancy initiating the relapse of diabetes. In the event of remission, individuals do not show symptoms or impairment Beta-cell function in the fasting state. Insulin secretory response to intravenous glucose loading might be abnormal in those destined to have a relapse of diabetes. TNDM caused by 6q24 genomic defects are always associated with IGUR. Other contributing factors are umbilical hernia and enlarged tongue, which are present in 9 and 30% of patients with chromosome 6q24 related TNDM. KCNJ11 and ABCC8 Genes In addition, TNDM initiated by the genes, KCNJ11 or ABCC8 mutations are similar to mutations in chromosome 6q24-related to TNDM. Normally, the birth weight in infants are lower in chromosome 6q24 TNDM patients and diabetes is initiated at an earlier age (similar to readmission). There may be an overlap between chromosome 6q24 and KCNJ11 and ABCC8-related TNDM, making genetic diagnosis necessary for treatment. INS Gene Recessive mutations in the INS gene encoding insulin were discovered to trigger both PNDM and TNDM. Diabetes occurs because there is an decrease insulin biosynthesis as a result of homozygous mutations. Common phenotype is decreased birth weight and average age of diagnosis is one week. Previous studies show relapse of diabetes occurred at an average age of 26 weeks. = Permanent Neonatal Diabetes Mellitus (PNDM) = PNDM is associated with mutations in the Beta-cell ATP sensitive potassium channel (KATP) initiated by heterozygous leading to mutations in KCNJ11 and ABCC8, which is a result of 31% and 10% of PNDM cases (results based on Exeter experiment series). Twelve percent of mutations in the insulin gene leads to PNDM. KCNJ11 and ABCC8 Genes association with Beta-cell ATP Sensitive Potassium Channel KCNJ11 encodes Kir6.2 (a protein coding gene in the potassium channel) and ABCC8 encodes the gene, SUR1 (the type 1 subunit of the sulfonylurea receptor), a member of the ATP-binding cassette transporter family, the two components of the KATP channel. This channel links glucose metabolism to insulin secretion by closing in response to ATP. Blood glucose storage into Beta-cells lead to glycolysis and cause ATP generation. The elevated ATP/ adenosine diphosphate ratio causes closure of the KATP channel, and inhibit potassium efflux (a lot of potassium flows out of this channel), that leads to depolarization of the Beta-cell membrane. Depolarization is the loss of the difference in charge between the inner and outer parts of the plasma membrane of a muscle. This occurs because of change in permeability and migration of sodium ions inside the cell. The voltage gated channels then open, allowing calcium (Ca+) to flow inside the channel and cause exocytosis (active transport that moves molecules out of a cell by ejecting them in an energy using process) of insulin-containing granules from the Beta-cells. Activation of defects in KCNJ11 or ABCC8 seems to make the KATP channel less sensitive to ATP, leaving more channels in an open state after high levels of glucose occurs. Resulting in the failure of insulin response to high blood glucose and leading to NDM.  Diagnosis =Diagnosis of TNDM and PNDM= The diagnostic evaluations are based upon current literature and research available on NDM. The following evaluation factors are: patients with TNDM are more likely to have intrauterine growth retardation and less likely to develop ketoacidosis than patients with PNDM. TNDM patients are younger at the age of diagnosis of diabetes and have lower insulin requirements, an overlap occurs between the two groups, therefore TNDM cannot be distinguished from PNDM based clinical feature. An early onset of diabetes mellitus is unrelated to autoimmunity in most cases, relapse of diabetes is common with TNDM, and extensive follow ups are important. In addition, molecular analysis of chromosomes 6 defects, KCNJ11 and ABCC8 genes (encoding Kir6.2 and SUR1) provide a way to identify PNDM in the infant stages. Approximately,50% of PNDM are associated with the potassium channel defects which are essential consequences when changing patients from insulin therapy to sulfonylureas. =TNDM Diagnosis associated with Chromosome 6q24 Mutations= The uniparental disomy of the chromosome can be used as diagnostic method provide proof by the analysis of polymorphic markers is present on Chromosome 6. Meiotic segregation of the chromosome can be distinguished by comparing allele profiles of polymorphic makers in the child to the child's parents' genome. Normally, a total uniparental disomy of the chromosome 6 is evidenced, but partial one can be identified. Therefore, genetic markers that are close to the region of interest in chromosome 6q24 can be selected. Chromosome duplication can found by that technique also. =Medical Professionals of NDM= * Physician * Endocrinologist * Geneticist Counselor =Diagnostic Test of NDM= * Fasting plasma glucose test: measures an diabetic's blood glucose after he or she has gone 8 hours without eat. This test is used to detect diabetes or pre-diabetes * Oral glucose tolerance test- measures an individual's blood glucose after he or she have gone at least 8 hours without eating and two hours after the diabetic individual have drunk a glucose-containing beverage. This test can be used to diagnose diabetes or pre-diabetes * Random plasma glucose test-the doctor checks one's blood glucose without regard to when an individual may have eaten his or her last meal. This test, along with an evaluation of symptoms, are used to diagnose diabetes but not pre-diabetes. =Genetic Testing of NDM= * Uniparental Disomy Test: Samples from fetus or child and both parents are needed for analysis. Chromosome of interest must be specified on request form. For prenatal samples (only): if the amniotic fluid (non-confluent culture cells) are provided. Amniotic fluid is added and charged separately. Also, if chorionic villus sample is provided, a genetic test will be added and charged separately. Microsatellites markers and polymerase chain reaction are used on the chromosomes of interest to test the DNA of the parent and child to identify the presence of uniparental disomy. * Intrauterine Growth Restriction Apgar score is a test given after birth to test the baby's physical condition and evaluate if special medical care is needed.  Treatment  In many cases, neonatal diabetes may be treated with oral sulfonylureas such as glyburide. Physicians may order genetic tests to determine whether or not transitioning from insulin to sulfonylurea drugs is appropriate for a patient. The transfer from insulin injections to oral glibenclamide therapy seems highly effective for most patients and safe. This illuminates how the molecular understanding of some monogenic form of diabetes may lead to an unexpected change of the treatment in children. This is a spectacular example of how the pharmacogenomic approach improves in a tremendous way the quality of life of the young diabetic patients. Insulin Therapy * Long Acting Insulin: (Insulin glargine)-is a hormone that works by lowering levels of blood glucose. It starts to work several hours after an injection and keeps working for 24 hours. It is used to manage blood glucose of diabetics. It is used to treat Type 1 and 2 diabetes in adults and Type 1 diabetes in kids as young as 6 years old. * Short Acting Insulin (e.g. Novolin or Velosulin)-It works similarly to natural insulin and takes up to 30 minutes and lasts for about 8 hours depending on the dosage used. * Intermediate Insulin: (e.g. NPH insulin)- Usually taken in combination with a short acting insulin. Intermediate acting insulin starts to activate within the first hour of injecting and enters a period of peak activity lasting for 7 hours. Sulfonylureas * Sulfonylureas: This medication signals the pancreas to release insulin and help the body's cells use insulin better. This medication can lower A1C levels ( AIC is defined as a measurement of the blood glucose after previous 2‚Äì3 months) by 1-2%.  Prognosis  The outcome for infants or adults with NDM have different outcomes among carriers of the disease. Among affected babies, some have PNDM while others have relapse of their diabetes and other patients may experience permanent remission. Diabetes may reoccur in the patient's childhood or adulthood. It was estimated that neonatal diabetes mellitus will be TNDM in about 50% are half of the cases. During the Neonatal stage, the prognosis is determined by the severity of the disease (dehydration and acidosis), also based on how rapidly the disease is diagnosed and treated. Associated abnormalities (e.g. irregular growth in the womb or enlarged tongue) can effect a person's prognosis. The long-term prognosis depends on the person's metabolic control, which effects the presence and complications of diabetes complications. The prognosis can be confirmed with genetic analysis to find the genetic cause of the disease. WIth proper management, the prognosis for overall health and normal brain development is normally good. It is highly advised people living with NDM seek prognosis from their health care provider.  Recent research  Clinical Trials of NDM * The research article is entitled, \\"A Successful Transition to sulfonamides treatment in male infant with novel neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM) caused by the ABBC8 gene mutation and 3 years follow up\\". It is a case study on the transitioning of treatments from insulin therapy to sulfonamides therapy. NDM is not initiated by an autoimmune mechanism but mutations in KATP-sensitive channel, KCNJ11, ABCC8 and INS genes are successful targets for changing treatments from insulin to sulfonamides therapy. * Introduction: Within this study a two month old male was admitted into the intensive care unit, because he was showing signs of diabetic ketoacidosis. Other symptoms include, respiratory tract infection, sporous, dehydration, reduced subcutaneous fat, Candida mucous infection. The infant's family history was negative for diseases of importance to hereditary and the eldest sibling was healthy. * Experiment: The current treatment plan consist of therapy for ketoacidosis was started upon admissions into the hospital. Also, subcutaneous insulin was given (0.025-0.05 units/kg/h) and adjusted to the glycaemic profiles and the patient was converted to euglycaemic state. After 24 hours, oral intake of insulin started and treatment continued with subcutaneous short acting insulin then intermediate acting insulin plus 2 dosage of short acting insulin. A genetic analysis was conducted for NDM and mutation of KCNJ11, ABCC8 and INS genes have been given. Sequence analysis showed a rare heterogeneous missense mutation, PF577L, in the patient's exon 12 of ABCC8 gene. This confirms diagnosis of NDM caused by heterozygous mutation in the SUR1 subunit of the pancreatic ATP-sensitive potassium channel, because his parents' white blood cells did not show signs of this mutation. * Results: Switching from the insulin therapy to the sulfonamides was a successful treatment. It is the current regimen used to treat NDM. * Discussion/Conclusion: ABCC8 gene produces SUR1 protein subunit that interacts with pancreatic ATP-sensitive potassium channel. When the channel opens a large amount of insulin is released. Mutations that occur in ABCC8 are associated with congential hyperinsulinism and PNDM or TNDM. Patients that have mutations in their potassium channel, improved their glucose levels with sulfonylurea regimen and glibenclamide showed successful results in managing glucose levels as well. * A 2006 study showed that 90% of patients with a KCNJ11 mutation were able to successfully transition to sulfonylurea therapy.

Plot  Karen Barth (Gilbert) is the divorced mother of Michael (Pierce), a 7-year- old young autistic boy who is unable to speak or write. After an incident in which Michael wanders away from home to the local playground, Karen's ex- husband Roger realizes that Michael may need more specialized care than she can provide, and suggests Michael be enrolled in a special residential school. Reluctant to do so, Karen nonetheless agrees to visit the campus, where she meets with therapist Terry Wilson (Duke), who explains just how the program will be able to help Michael, which finally convinces Karen to enroll him, although she is put off by the school's requirement that she not visit for 6 weeks. Initially clashing with Terry's approach, Karen grudgingly comes to realize that the separation period is necessary for adjustment and takes a job at a local greenhouse. Meanwhile, Michael begins gradually making progress, learning such basics as tying his shoes, in addition to such chores as making his bed and helping prepare meals in the cottage he shares with his caretaker, Jeff. Eventually, Terry suggests to Jeff and school head Eliot that they try a form of facilitated communication: having Michael type his thoughts on a computer keyboard, with Terry guiding his hand. Eliot is reluctant, but Jeff is outright dismissive, claiming Michael's \\"not that bright\\" and \\"can't even spell.\\" However, Eliot finally agrees to give Terry a one-month trial period with Michael (and only Michael) to see if it works. Initially, Michael only types gibberish, but Terry keeps at it, and a breakthrough finally occurs when Karen comes for a visit and, in an emotional moment, he types a greeting of \\"MOM HI\\" to her, finally breaking his long silence. Karen then asks Michael if he knows how much she loves him, to which he types \\"YES\\", and then he reveals something she had never known when he types \\"DAD GONE. I BRAK CAR. MY FALT\\". Shocked by this, Karen tells Michael, \\"No. No, honey, not your fault.\\" Then she tells Terry the story of the night that she and Roger divorced, in which Michael got upset, and broke the car window. Karen assures him the car was not the reason for their divorce; instead, she and Roger weren't getting along. She then tells Michael that both she and Roger love him very much, and kisses his head. Later, Karen shares news of her first conversation with Michael to an initially skeptical Roger, admitting to having been wrong about Terry before and thanking him for recommending the school. After mentioning the revelation that Michael thought the divorce was his fault, Roger expresses guilt over having never explained the reason for his departure, but Karen assures him that she set Michael straight, and even if he's not convinced, he'll now be able to tell them. Things seem to be looking up, with Karen even receiving a pay raise at the greenhouse. However, trouble soon looms over the horizon, after Jeff departs for a two-week vacation to Florida. Michael begins having nightmares, acting out, neglecting his chores and becoming harder to handle. Needing some answers, Terry asks Michael why, to which he types out \\"JEFF.\\" Initially thinking it's related to Jeff being away, Terry is surprised when Michael further clarifies this by typing \\"KEEP JEFF AWAY.\\" When Terry asks \\"Keep Jeff away? Why?\\", Michael, judging from his painful expression, types out the unthinkable: \\"SEX\\" (meaning he was molested), to which Terry responds in a shocked and horrified voice, \\"Oh, my God.\\" Informed with this, an enraged Karen demands that Michael be pulled from the school, but he expresses his desire to remain there: \\"I STAY\\". After Jeff is arrested, a detective is dispatched to the school and questions Michael about the abuse; believing him to be credible, he comments to Terry on how impressive this form of communication is before leaving. All is not well for Karen, however. Feeling hurt that Michael had put his trust in Terry rather than his own mother, and despite Roger's gratitude that Michael actually told someone about the abuse, Karen has suddenly cut off all contact, not returning phone calls or showing up for visits and shutting herself up in the house. Finally, Terry pays her a visit and explains that despite all the school has accomplished for Michael, he still needs Karen in his life, and that it's important for them to work together. This gets her to come around, and as they prepare for trial (an uphill battle, not helped by the double whammy of the court's reluctance to use facilitated communication to provide testimony and the fact that Jeff recanted his confession), Karen stresses to Terry how important it is that she help Michael \\"find his voice\\" in court. After being established as a credible witness, Michael gets through questioning by the district attorney with no problem, but when cross-examined by Jeff's attorney, he has an episode on the witness stand, forcing the judge to call a recess. While the defense calls for a mistrial, a compromise is reached: another cross-examination will take place in a separate area, relayed back to the courtroom via closed-circuit TV, and without the presence of Jeff. Asked by Karen if he wants to try again, Michael types \\"I CAN DO IT MOM\\", and the trial proceeds. Things go smoother this time, and in the end, Jeff is found guilty of performing a lewd act upon a child. Karen then relays the good news to Michael, who types \\"WE WON\\" after hearing it, to which Karen happily replies, \\"Yes, we did.\\" Michael hugs Karen, as Karen kisses him, and he continues playing on the swing. The film ends with Karen and Terry watching Michael play, as Karen says, \\"He is a tough little kid.\\" to which Terry humorously replies, \\"Wonder where he got that.\\" Terry then says, \\"We have a long way to go with him.\\" to which Karen replies, \\"We'll go together. We're a good team.\\" Cast *Patty Duke as Terry Wilson *Melissa Gilbert as Karen Barth *Bradley Pierce as Michael Barth *Markus Flanagan as Roger Barth *Lisa Banes as Marla Tolbert *Roger Aaron Brown as Eliot *Peter Spears as Jeff *Shelley Morrison as Lupe *Troy Evans Production and release The film was initially scheduled to air on September 25, 1994.

It is owned and operated by the Memphis - Shelby County Airport Authority. History General DeWitt Spain Airport began as an idea in 1928 when the Memphis Chamber of Commerce Engineering Committee suggested turning Mud Island into Memphis' Airport. They decided against that location for a main airport and moved Memphis International Airport to its current location in South Memphis. However, the idea apparently did not fade. In 1959, Memphis Downtown Airport was put into service about where Mud Island Park is today to service the general aviation community. It had the slogan: \\"You're strictly uptown when you land downtown.\\" A ferry boat took travelers from the Island to the cobblestones, and then it was just a short walk to the offices of Memphis' city center. Private pilots who worked downtown and business travelers had the perfect arrangement. By 1961, 30 planes were landing per day, according to newspaper reports. By the mid-1960s Interstate 40 was scheduled to cross the Island. Airport owners fought the I-40 Bridge, but in August, 1970, the last plane departed the island airport. Quickly the airport authority purchased available land just to the north of the island so downtown commuters could once again have their landing strip back. The following May, Memphis Downtown Airport was replaced by General DeWitt Spain Airport, honoring local war hero General DeWitt Spain who died in 1969. It has been and still is an active general aviation airport. On April 11, 2016, General Dewitt Spain Airport suffered its first accident of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle after a Phantom Quadcopter impacted the side of a hangar. No fatalities were reported. The Quadcopter was unregistered and unable to be traced to the operator.  Facilities and aircraft  Runway 17/35 is a 3,800 √ó 75 ft (1,158 √ó 23 m) asphalt runway.

In 1999 he was invited by the American State Department as an international representative of Haiti at the Assembly on the Democracy organized by the United Nations in Poland. He built strong international relations and is one of the most consulted Haitians about Caribbean affairs. At the start of 2000 he fought the Haitian Government on the international scene following several assassinations of Haitian journalists, such as Brignol Lindor of the town of Petit-Goave and Jean Dominique, Director of Haiti Radio-Inter, alerting the International Press Federation, the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, the Inter- American Press Company and the International Court of the Human Rights at The Hague. In 2003, Jean-Gardy went to Amsterdam to meet members of the International Court of The Hague about the trafficking of Haitian children under the guise of adoption. On this subject he had a series of discussions with Dutch government officials, demanding better control on international adoptions to avoid a new black slave trade from Haiti. These steps led to a systematic inspection of adoption records between Haiti, the Dominican Republic, the United States and Europe. In 2004, Jean-Gardy led several missions to the Governor of Florida Jeb Bush and his officials to convince them to create a Plan of Assistance to Haiti in the priority fields of public health, education and gifts of equipment for rubbish collection and fire control. In Florida he created a new television network called Haiti World TV (HWT) which broadcasts information programs about Haiti and Haitian History for the education of Haitian communities.

Dean of the University Center for the training of Journalists, in 1985 he was asked by the Military Academy of Haiti to deliver courses on communication techniques, then, at the Police Academy of Haiti in 1995. Fall of Duvalier In the fall of the Haitian President Jean Claude Duvalier, the National council of Government of Haiti (CNG) appointed him director of the Daily newspaper of State Haiti Released (1986), but he resigned 6 months later affirming \\"not want to guarantee useless massacres of the civil population\\". Jean Gardy has entirely reorganized the Association of the Haitian Journalists (AJH) which he directed for 4 years, imposing the presence of this institution in the new Haitian Constitution of 1987. He was Director General of the Investigation Group Press (1987), and called by the president Ertha Pascal Trouillot to head the National radio of Haiti (1990‚Äì1991) and to help in the organization of the Presidential Elections which led to the presidential election of Jean Bertrand Aristide. Named by Aristide Ambassador of Haiti in Japan in 1991, Jean-Gardy retracted following the arrest of the President Ertha Pascal Trouillot. He preferred to integrate the system of the United Nations where he was hired by the Representative resident Reinhart Helmcke (Germany), as Coordinator of Programs (Hai89018 project) and Consulting National at the World Health Organization (WHO). Other experiments allowed Jean-Gardy to be the Representative in Haiti of International Union of the French Press for freedom of expression.

The route existed between 1937 and 1997, after which it was decommissioned and transferred to the county. In 2001, Victoria County amalgamated into the city of Kawartha Lakes, and the road became known as Kawartha Lakes Road 46\\\\. It is long, passing through the villages of Woodville, Argyle and Bolsover.  Route description  Prior to its downloading to the municipal level on April 1, 1997, Highway 46 was a fairly straight highway following the north-south lot boundaries of Victoria County, between the fifth and sixth lots of Mariposa Township and the second and third lots of Eldon Township. It began in the south at a junction with Highway 7 just east of Manilla and approximately west of Lindsay. It progressed north, surrounded mostly by pastureland and the occasional wooded lot. There are few farms surrounding the flat route, as the soils in the region are very thin and underlain by a limestone bedrock. Progressing north, the highway travelled straight for approximately until it entered the village of Woodville, where it encountered Victoria County Road 9 (King Street), onto which it turned westward. After a brief concurrency, Highway 46 branched north and exited the village, back into pasturelands. It travelled straight for another , passing through the hamlet of Lorneville midway. At the crossroads of Victoria County Road 8 (Glenarm Road), the route passed through the small hamlet of Argyle. The final segment travelled in a straight line through the same surroundings, though it featured more undulated terrain. The highway ended at Highway 48 (Portage Road) in the community of Boslover.  History  Highway 46 was incorporated into the Ontario provincial highway system in 1937, running from east of Manilla on Highway 7 northwards to Bolsover, and north-east from there to Coboconk where it ended at Highway 35 with a length of . Originally unpaved in its entirety, the first to Argyle were paved in 1952, followed by the to Kirkfield in 1957. A final were paved in 1959 to Victoria Road. Its routing prior to 1975 followed the present day Kawartha Lakes Road 48 through Kirkfield, Victoria Road, Corsons, and ended in Coboconk. Before 1963, the route between Victoria Road and Coboconk followed the shores of Balsam Lake, as the lots set out in the surveying of Bexley Township were 2 miles deep, and running a road at the back of the lots would require the maintenance of 38 two-mile driveways. In the early 1960s, Balsam Lake Provincial Park was announced and located on the northwest shores of the lake. Highway 46 ran along the shore of Balsam Lake on what is now Balsam Lake Drive and North Bay Drive at the time of the announcement, and so it was decided that a new alignment would be built further from the lake to pass the front of the new park. The bypass was opened and signed as Highway 46 on June 28, 1967.Department of Highways pp. 65, 85 The designation would last just under a decade. In 1975, the province of Ontario performed a systematic renumbering of its highways, and Highway 46 between Bolsover and Coboconk became a part of Highway 48, truncating Highway 46 to its final length of . Budget constraints brought on by a recession in the 1990s resulted in the Mike Harris provincial government forming the Who Does What? committee to determine cost-cutting measures in order to balance the budget after a deficit incurred by former premier Bob Rae. It was determined that many Ontario highways no longer served long-distance traffic movement and should therefore be maintained by local or regional levels of government. The MTO consequently transferred many highways to lower levels of government in 1997 and 1998, removing a significant percentage of the provincial highway network. As Highway 46 generally only served local traffic heading towards cottage country, and not province-wide movement, the route was transferred to Victoria County on April 1, 1997. It was subsequently redesignated as Victoria County Road 46. Until June 28, 1967, Highway 46 followed the shores of Balsam Lake. The route was moved inland, and became part of Highway 48 in 1975.

Attempts have been made to reconstruct the political developments of this period by reference to early medieval Irish genealogical texts. Ireland in Classical literature=Early references= Classical writers occasionally refer to Ireland under a variety of names, but these references contain little reliable information. For example, Diodorus Siculus claims that the Prettanoi of the island of Iris eat human flesh.Diodorus Siculus, Historical Library 5.32 Strabo, who calls the island Ierne, repeats the accusation, adding that they consider it honourable to eat their dead fathers, and openly have sex with their mothers and sisters (although he is sceptical about his sources).Strabo, Geographica 4.5.4 Pomponius Mela calls it Iuverna and says that, although the climate is unfavourable for grain, grass grows so richly that cattle burst if unrestrained from eating it.Pomponius Mela, De Chorographia 3.53 Julius Caesar, in his Commentarii de Bello Gallico, is the first to call the island Hibernia, describes it as about half the size of Britain, and correctly places it to the west of BritainJulius Caesar, Commentarii de Bello Gallico 5.13 ‚Äì unlike Strabo, who places it to the north. =Tacitus= Tacitus says that his father-in-law Gnaeus Julius Agricola, while governor of Britain (AD 78-85), considered conquering Ireland, believing it could be held with one legion plus auxiliaries, and entertained an exiled Irish petty king with the intention of making him the pretext for conquest.Tacitus, Agricola 24 Parallels have been drawn with the Irish legend of T√∫athal Techtmar, who is said to have been exiled to Britain as a child and returned with an army to claim the kingship of Tara in the 1st century.R. B. Warner, \\"Tuathal Techtmar: A Myth or Ancient Literary Evidence for a Roman Invasion?\\", Emania 13, 1995, pp. 23‚Äì32 Tacitus also says that most of the harbours and approaches to Ireland were known through commerce, but inaccurately locates the island between Britain and the Iberian peninsula. =Juvenal= The 2nd-century poet Juvenal, in his second Satire, contrasting the victories of the Roman army with the low morals of the people at home in Rome, says that, as well as conquering Britain and the Orkney islands, \\"we have advanced arms beyond the shores of Iuverna\\". Although Juvenal is not writing history, it is possible that he is referring to a genuine Roman military expedition to Ireland.Philip Freeman, Ireland and the Classical World, University of Texas Press, 2001, pp. 62-64 = Ptolemy = The 2nd-century Alexandrian Greek writer Ptolemy, one of the most important geographers, mathematicians and astronomers in the ancient world, refers to Ireland in two of his works. In the astronomical treatise known as the Almagest he gives the latitudes of an island he calls Mikra Brettania (ŒúŒπŒ∫œÅ·Ω∞ ŒíœÅŒµœÑœÑŒ±ŒΩŒØŒ±) or \\"Little Britain\\" (the south of the island at 58 degrees, the north at 61 degrees). In his Geography, at the same latitudes, he places the Prettanic island Iwernia, next to its neighbour, the Prettanic island Albion (Great Britain). The Geography contains the most detailed account of Ireland in classical literature, giving the latitude and longitude of six promontories, fifteen river mouths, ten settlements and nine islands, and naming sixteen population groups. 300px Peoples of Ireland according to Ptolemy's Geography.Philip Freeman, Ireland and the Classical World, University of Texas Press, 2001, pp. 64-84 North coast Ptolemy describes the northern coast of Ireland, from the Northern Promontory (possibly Bloody Foreland or Rossan Point in County Donegal) in the west, to the Wenniknion promontory (probably Malin Head), the mouth of the river Widwa (probably the Foyle), the mouth of the river Argita (perhaps the Bann) and the Rhobogdion promontory (Fair Head, County Antrim) in the east. The peoples who inhabit the north coast are the Wenniknioi in the west and the Rhobogdioi in the east. West coast The west coast is poorly represented compared to the other three, and identification of the names Ptolemy gives is speculative. He begins with the Northern Promontory (see above), and working north to south names the river Rhawiu (possibly the Erne); the town Magnata (a settlement of the Magnatai people, possibly somewhere in County Sligo); the mouth of the rivers Libniu (possibly Clew Bay), Ausoba (perhaps Galway Bay) Senu (probably the Shannon, although placed too far to the north), Dur (possibly Dingle Bay) and Iernu (possibly the Kenmare), and the Southern Promontory (any one of Slea Head, Bray Head, Dursey Head and Mizen Head). Peoples of this coast are: the Erdinoi near Donegal Bay; the Magnatai or Nagnatai of County Mayo and Sligo; the Auteinoi between County Galway and the Shannon, identifiable with the early medieval Uaithni; the Ganganoi, also known in north Wales, and the Wellaboroi in the far south- west.T. F. O'Rahilly, Early Irish History and Mythology, Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, 1946Eoin MacNeill, \\"Early Irish population groups: their nomenclature, classification and chronology\\", Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy (C) 29, 1911, pp. 59‚Äì114 South coast The south coast stretches from the Southern Promontory to the mouths of the rivers Dabrona (possibly the Lee or the Blackwater) and Birgu (probably the Barrow) and the Sacred Promontory (Carnsore Point, County Wexford). Peoples of the south coast are the Iwernoi in the west, who share their name with the island, Iwernia, and can be identified with the early medieval √ârainn; the Usdiai, and the Brigantes in the east, who share their name with a people of Roman Britain. East coast From the Sacred Promontory in the south to the Rhobogdion promontory in the north, Ptolemy names the river Modonnu (possibly the Slaney, but more likely the Avoca), the town of Manapia (a settlement of the Manapii), the river Oboka (perhaps the Liffey; the river Avoca takes its modern name from a misinterpretation of Ptolemy's Oboka), the town of Eblana (a settlement of the Eblanoi, formerly mistakenly identified with Dublin), the river Buwinda (the Boyne), the promontory Isamnion, the river Winderios (possibly Carlingford Lough, Dundrum Bay or Strangford Lough), and the river Logia (Belfast Lough, Loch Laoigh in Irish). Peoples named, from south to north, are: the Koriondoi; the Manapioi, possibly related to the Menapii of Gaul; the Kaukoi, probably not related to the Germanic Chauci of the Low Countries; the Eblanoi; the Woluntioi, identifiable with the early medieval Ulaid; and the Darinoi. =Later references= Roman sources mention raids on Britain by Saxons of north-west Germany, by Picts from Scotland and by two groups of people usually associated with Ireland, the Scotti and the Atacotti. The origins and meanings of Scotti and Atacotti is uncertain. Atacotti disappears with the Romans. Scotti means Gaels to Adomn√°n in the late seventh century, but not to Columbanus in the early sixth century, who uses the older term Iberi instead. The Scotti are perhaps a confederation of tribes in Ulster, and the Atacotti one in Leinster, but this is not certain.Charles-Edwards, pp. 158‚Äì160. Origins in the Hebrides have also been suggested for the Atacotti. The Late Roman army as recorded by the Notitia Dignitatum included auxilia palatina named for the Atacotti, the normal interpretation of such names being that they were recruited from prisoners of war.

Throughout the book, the reader is introduced to one corrupt character after another, from cops who take payments to stay quiet to the alcoholic priest, whose knowledge of the truth is deteriorating his very soul.Solares, Martin.

Web. 23 Oct. 2013. . Solares' first novel, The Black Minutes () is a crime fiction thriller that, according to Jos√© Agust√≠n, awakens memories of Rafael Bernal's while a book review published at The New York Times by Larry Rohter found it reminiscent of Roberto Bola√±o's 2666 or Paco Ignacio Taibo II's detective stories; claiming that \\"he employs some flourishes that would seem to situate him in the postmodernist camp, including the occasional surrealistic episodes and his habit of mixing real and fictional characters.\\" In an interview with The Times, Junot D√≠az expressed that The Black Minutes \\"is Latin American fiction at its pulpy phantasmagorical finest, [..] a literary masterpiece masquerading as a police procedural and nothing else I‚Äôve read this year comes close. Solares does for Latin American literature what Eduardo Lago did for Iberian literature with his monumental novel Ll√°mame Brooklyn.\\" The novel was shortlisted for the R√≥mulo Gallegos International Novel Prize and has been published in Spanish, English, German and Polish. The Black Minutes and Film Noir With the styles of hard-boiled detectives, The Black Minutes is laden with notions of film noir. It has all the classic points that make noirs what they- an opening of a murder, a detective who follows the trail, flashbacks, etc. However, by setting this is a fictional Mexican town, the two detectives must deal with corruption around every corner- men serving time for crimes they have not committed (how Ren√© Luz de Dios Lopez was framed for the murder of the young girls as ‚ÄúThe Jackal‚Äù) and members of the cartel truly running the show (how Cabrera was nervous when he realized he confiscated a pistol from the cartel boss‚Äôs son). The narrative, in particular, is a quintessential part of the noir film, as it plays up on logic and switches in the readers focus. The best way, a way Solares uses, is by implementing flashbacks. By using flashbacks for both Cabrera and Rangel, the reader is able to follow the opposing logics and begin developing his or her own prediction for the end.Polan, Dana. \\"College Course File: FILM NOIR .\\" Journal of Film and Video . 37.2 (1985): 75-83. .

He began wrestling professionally in 1953 and competed until 1977. During his career, he wrestled in the United States, United Kingdom, Japan, and Canada. After retiring from wrestling, he became a leader of the Mohawk nation on the Kahnawake reservation. He played a major role in blockading the Honor√© Mercier Bridge during the 1990 Oka Crisis. He has also appeared in several movies. Early life Two Rivers grew up in Kahnawake speaking Mohawk at home. He learned English in school, which was only available up to 8th grade. He caught the eye of Don Eagle, who became his guardian when Two Rivers was 16 so that he could go to Columbus, Ohio with Eagle to train as a wrestler. Already at that time Two Rivers was 6 feet tall and 185 pounds. In Columbus he lived at the YMCA, preparing for his wrestling career with Eagle. Wrestling career=1950s= Two Rivers was trained by Don Eagle, a former World Heavyweight Champion in the Boston-based American Wrestling Association. When Don Eagle, also from Kahnawake, returned to the reservation to take a break from wrestling, he met Two Rivers and agreed to take him to Columbus, Ohio for training. The training lasted for two years, during which time Two Rivers increased his weight to 205 pounds while learning how to wrestle. Two Rivers made his professional debut in February 1953 in Detroit, Michigan, facing Rose Martino of Italy. He spent the next several years competing in the United States, first in Ohio and then throughout the Atlantic Coast. He competed against such wrestlers as \\"Wild Bull\\" Curry and Larry Hamilton. He also formed a tag team with Don Eagle from 1956 to 1959. As a team, they faced a wide variety of opponents, including Ray Stevens, Boris Malenko, and Fritz Von Erich. From 1957 to 1959, he competed primarily in North Carolina. In addition to Don Eagle, Two Rivers teamed with such wrestlers as Antonino Rocca and Red Bastien. It was with George Becker, however, that Two Rivers held his first championship belt. On April 6, 1959, they won the Southern version of the NWA Southern Tag Team Championship by defeating Alberto and Enrique Torres. They held the title for three months before dropping them to the team of Mr. Moto and Duke Keomuka. After losing the championship, Two Rivers considered moving to Calgary, Alberta to work for Stampede Wrestling. He met Ray Napolitano, a wrestler from the United Kingdom, however, who told him to consider competing overseas. Two Rivers flipped a coin to decide where to move; ultimately, he chose the United Kingdom, where he began competing in October 1959. =1960s= Wrestling in England and Scotland, Two Rivers gained fame due to his First Nations heritage. He wore a feathered headdress, had a Mohawk hairstyle, and performed a war dance during some of his matches. He has stated that he was a \\"journeyman\\" wrestler rather than a major star, and that people wanted to see him because he was \\"an attraction\\". He was successful, however, and his time in the United Kingdom, where Paul LeDuc has stated that Two Rivers was \\"treated like a God\\", helped him become an \\"international star\\". Two Rivers returned to the United States in September 1965 and resumed wrestling in North Carolina. After six months, which included teaming with Karl Gotch to defeat the Blond Bombers (Rip Hawk and Swede Hanson), Two Rivers left the territory to compete in Japan. He competed there until at least May 13, 1966, after which point there is no record of him wrestling again until 1971. =1970s= In 1971 and 1972, Two Rivers competed in several matches in Ontario and Quebec, often as part of a tag team with Johnny War Eagle. The following year, he returned to the United Kingdom, where he stayed to wrestle until late in 1974. At that point, he wrestled several matches in Germany before returning to Canada. He made the decision to return because his family asked him to spend more time at home. Competing for the Montreal-based Grand Prix Wrestling (GPW), he held the GPW Tag Team Championship while teaming with Jean War Eagle in 1974. He remained in Canada, facing such wrestlers as Sailor White, The Sheik, and Kurt Von Hess, for the rest of his career. His final title victory came on August 3, 1976, when he defeated Serge Dumont to win the Canadian International Heavyweight Championship. He retired in 1977, and has stated that one of the best parts of his career was \\"ending [his] career healthy\\". Two Rivers was inducted into the Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame (now in Wichita Falls, Texas; previously in Amsterdam, New York). He also served as the curator of the section for First Nations wrestlers, \\"War Chiefs of the Mat.\\" After wrestling After retiring from wrestling, Two Rivers became involved in the governance of the Kahnawake reservation, serving as an elder, chief, and councillor. In 1990, Two Rivers helped lead the Mohawk nation during the Oka Crisis. A golf course in the village of Oka, Quebec planned to expand onto land claimed by the Mohawk as traditional land. The Mohawk people objected to the plan to cut down a sacred grove of pines and build on top of their burial grounds. During the dispute, the First Nations group blockaded a bridge, and a member of the S√ªret√© du Qu√©bec was killed. He has appeared in several movies, including Pocahontas: The Legend., Black Robe, and Taking Lives, He appeared in the 1973 documentary The Wrestling Queen. He has also appeared in the made- for-television movies Red Earth, White Earth and Northern Passage. Two Rivers is the father of British fashion designer Wayne Hemingway. Two Rivers' name has entered popular culture in many forms. A British racing horse shares Two Rivers' name and was christened after him. The British band The Dogs D'Amour also named a song after Two Rivers on its In the Dynamite Jet Saloon album in 1988. Two Rivers plays a large role in Pulitzer Prize-winner Paul Muldoon's poem \\"My Father and I and Billy Two Rivers\\". The poem discusses watching Two Rivers in a wrestling match and compares the pre-determined outcome to the Boston Tea Party. After learning a photograph of him was to be featured on the cover of Van Morrison's September 2017 album, Roll with the Punches, Two Rivers sued the singer and his label, Universal Music Group, in July, claiming they did not seek permission to use his likeness. On August 4, his lawyer announced the parties had agreed in principle to settle out of court, and were negotiating details toward dismissing the now-suspended suit.

The average high temperature peaks at , but highs can often surpass that, with the all-time record high standing at . Humidity is often around 80 percent, which is a drastic change for someone living in the Southwest United States. Rain is common, and is often accompanied by strong or severe thunderstorms. These will cause quite a large amount of rain, but they do not last long at all. Air conditioning is popular among most households in the summer months, because high temperatures and high humidity can make the air feel much warmer than the actual temperature. Autumn Autumn is fairly mild, with daytime temperatures in the 70s and 60s. Autumn brings more wind, and sometimes heavier rainfall. Trees begin to lose their leaves before the cold winter season. Indian summer may occur. Winter Winters are cool to cold, with January's high temperature at . The highest temperature recorded was in February, in March, and in both December and January. Snowfall is common, with amounts varying greatly between seasons. Snow, ice, sleet, and freezing rain can cause road problems and school closures. In February 2007, Interstate Highway 78 was closed just west of the city. Drivers were stranded on the stretch of highway for as much as 24 hours, with overturned tractor trailers blocking the way. Winter sports are popular, such as snowboarding and skiing, and they can be enjoyed in the Pocono Mountains, just north of the Lehigh Valley. Spring Spring is a season of growth, with new grass growing and flowers blooming. Animals come out of hibernation, and sun fills the city and its surroundings. Temperatures are on the rise, but March and April bring much rain, with light rain that can last for hours on end. That gives way to warm May and June months, and shore weather is in the forecast for many residents. Natural disasters Hurricanes, Tropical storms, and Tropical Depressions are all summer threats. Severe thunderstorms are an even bigger threat, and can cause flash flooding. When flash flooding occurs, mudslides are rare but are possible. Tornadoes and earthquakes are not common, but they have been reported. Blizzards have happened, but usually once every ten or fifteen years. Pollution Air pollution is a problem in the area, as with Philadelphia and New York City, both of which lie less than 100 miles from Allentown. Although many factories have left, air pollution is still a problem. Light pollution is becoming an issue, since streetlights and businesses are on every street in the city.

His identity is not definitively known; most football researchers now identify him as Arthur Henry Patrick Savage (18 October 1850 ‚Äì 15 August 1905), but there are other contenders. Identity Football historians have always had difficulty identifying the precise name and details of A.H. Savage who played for the original Crystal Palace club and played for England against Scotland in the fifth international between the countries in March 1876. The three main contenders are: :Alfred Henry Savage, born in Reading in 1854; :Arthur Harold Savage, of the English & Oriental Hotel in Penang, who died in Penang on 4 August 1930; :Arthur Henry Patrick Savage, born in Sydney, Australia on 18 October 1850. Even though no contemporary match reports refer to the player as A.H.P. Savage, most researchers now favour the latter. Football career Little is known about his club career, although he was a Crystal Palace player at the time of the international, and he later played representative football for Surrey. Match reports described him as \\"big and red-bearded\\" and commented on his \\"terrific kick that was well used to set up attacks\\". Unfortunately, \\"defensively (he) was prone to being in the wrong place at the wrong time\\", thus contributing to England's defeat. His sole international appearance came against Scotland at Hamilton Crescent, Partick on 4 March 1876. According to Philip Gibbons, at this time \\"the England side tended to be chosen on availability rather than skill alone.\\" England struggled throughout the game, which saw the home team run out winners by three goals to nil.

It was a proprietary club founded by one Captain John Elliott, in response to the heavy over-subscription of existing clubs for servicemen, such as the Naval and Military Club and the Army and Navy Club. The club opened its doors in August 1870, in temporary premises at 19 Dover Street, and by June of the following year, it already had some 270 members, and its patrons and honorary members included the Prince of Wales, Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, the French Emperor Napoleon III, and the latter's son Louis Napol√©on, Prince Imperial. Meanwhile, a sumptuous clubhouse was erected at 66-68 Pall Mall during 1874-5, being ready by the end of 1875. However, the lavish scale of the construction appears to have ruined the club's owner, with bankruptcy proceedings pending in June 1878. By the following year, the club had closed. Subsequent occupants of the Pall Mall building seem to have been dogged by misfortune - the tenure of both the Beaconsfield Club (1880‚Äì1887) and the Unionist Club (1888‚Äì1892) were to be short-lived.

It is located approximately 25 kilometers southeast of Van along the road leading to the city of Hakk√¢ri, in a valley once known as Hayots Dzor (; \\"Valley of the Armenians\\") in historic Armenia. It was used by the Urartian kings as a fortress during the 8th century BC. In Armenian folklore it is the fortress built by Hayk, the legendary founder of the Armenian nation, close to the site where he slew the invading Babylonian King Bel or possibly Nimrod.  Site  The site of Haykaberd. Part of Urartian Sardurihinilli. Sarduri-Hinilli has a linear plan, perched upon a ridge overlooking the G√ºrpƒ±nar Plain. It is composed of fortification walls as well as the remains of an Urartian royal palace, built between 764 and 735 BC during the reign of King Sarduri II (764-735 BC) at the climax of power of the Urartian Empire. There are upper and lower sections of the fortress in which the Temple of Khaldi, citadel walls, king's tower, workshops (7th century BC), storehouses, cisterns, kitchen, palace with a throne room, \\"royal\\" toilet, harem and colonnaded halls were located. A moat surrounded sections of the fortress. Sarduri-Hinilli was destroyed in the 7th century BC, presumably by the Scythians. Traces of a later medieval occupation exists. The site was excavated between 1961 and 1986 by Afif Erzen.  In folklore = Hayk and King Bel = In Movses Khorenatsi's account, Hayk, son of Torgom, had a child named Armanak while he was living in Babylon. After the arrogant Titanid Bel made himself king over all, Hayk emigrated to the region near Mount Ararat with an extended household of at least 300 and settled there, founding a village he named Haykashen. On the way, he had left a detachment in another settlement with his grandson Kadmos. Bel sent one of his sons to entreat him to return, but was refused. Bel decided to march against him with a massive force, but Hayk was warned ahead of time by Kadmos of his pending approach. He assembled his own army along the shore of Lake Van and told them that they must defeat and kill Bel, or die trying to do so, rather than become his slaves. In his writings Movses states that: = The Battle of the Giants and Defeat of Bel = Hayk defeats Bel with an arrow. Hayk and his men soon discovered Bel's army positioned in a mountain pass (Moses of Chorene located the site as Dastakert), with the king in the vanguard. At Dyutsaznamart (, \\"Battle of Giants\\"), near Julamerk southeast of Lake Van, on August 11, 2492 BC dated by Mikayel Chamchian; Razmik Panossian, The Armenians: From Kings And Priests to Merchants And Commissars, Columbia University Press (2006), , p. 106. (according to the Armenian traditional chronology) or 2107 BC (according to \\"The Chronological table\\" of Mikael Chamchian), Hayk slew Bel with a nearly impossible shot using a long bow, sending the king's forces into disarray. The hill where Bel with his warriors fell, Hayk named Gerezmank meaning \\"tombs\\".Gerezmank: the nom. pl, Gerezmans being acc. pl., \\"tombs\\" He embalmed the corpse of Bel and ordered it to be taken to Hark where it was to be buried in a high place in the view of the wives and sons of the king.

She is a former international cricketer and President of the Oxford Union. She was captain of Middlesex for two seasons and a member of the Western Storm in the Kia Super League, having previously played for the England Academy. A right-handed batter and off break bowler, she played for Somerset until 2012. She was president of the Oxford Union in 2011 and has been described as \\"the most engaging president that the Oxford Union has had in years\\". Westbury began playing cricket in the Netherlands, and represented the country at both the 2004 and 2006 European Under-21 Championships. She made her senior international debut at the 2005 European Championship. During this tournament, she also made her only One Day International appearance, playing for the Netherlands against Ireland. She moved to England in 2006 to study, and joined Somerset for the 2007 season, where she played until signing for Middlesex. In 2010, she was selected as part of the England Academy, travelling to India for the High Performance Camp. Cricket career=The Netherlands= Born in Hammersmith, London, Isabelle Westbury experienced a nomadic childhood, living in Mongolia, Malaysia, Easter Island and Syria before arriving in the Netherlands. She attended The British School in the Netherlands from 2001 to 2006. It was in the Netherlands that she first started playing cricket, after being prevented from playing club football alongside boys beyond the age of 13, at the \\"very traditional club\\" near her house. Turning to cricket instead, Westbury played boys cricket for The Hague Cricket Club, and was picked for the national side aged just 14, making her first appearance at the 2004 European Under-21 Championships. Playing as wicket-keeper, she claimed one catch and then scored 15 not out batting from number nine as Ireland won by 98 runs. In the Netherlands' second match of the competition, she moved down to number eleven, and remained unbeaten without scoring when England secured a 219-run victory with over 10 overs remaining. Another loss in the final match of the competition ensured that the Netherlands finished bottom of the table‚ÄîWestbury scored five runs as no Dutch batsman managed to reach double figures against Scotland. In 2005, aged 15, Westbury represented the senior Netherlands side for the first time during the 2005 European Championship in Wales. Unlike her appearances for the Under-21s, which she made as wicket-keeper, Westbury played as a bowler for the duration of the tournament, batting in the lower order. She claimed three wickets during the tournament at an average of 46.66. Only required to bat twice, she scored 1 and 0*, made during losses against England Development Squad and Ireland respectively. The 2006 European Under-21 Championships saw Westbury reprise her role as wicket-keeper batsman for the youth side. The Netherlands were much improved from the 2004 tournament; after a heavy loss to England in a warm-up match, the Netherlands won their final match to finish runners-up behind England. She scored 30 in the second match, a loss to Ireland, as only herself and Lotte Egging reached double figures for the Netherlands. She made her highest total for the Under-21s in the final match of the competition, scoring 75 before being run out as the Netherlands reached 180 off their 50 overs, and then bowled Scotland out, achieving a 95 run victory. She finished the competition as the leading run-scorer and won the Player of the Tournament for her achievements. =England= Westbury started at Millfield School in Street, Somerset in 2006 on a sports scholarship. She joined Somerset for the 2007 County Championship. After her first match, in which she batted at number nine, and was 19 not out at the close of the innings, she opened the innings for the county for the remainder of the season. She enjoyed mixed success in the role, and finished the season with a batting average of 19.75, the third- best for Somerset. Remaining with Somerset in 2008, she claimed her first wicket for the county during their first match of the season, having Surrey opener Ebony-Jewel Rainford-Brent caught. She appeared in the Super Fours‚Äîa competition in which the England selectors place the 48 leading players into four teams‚Äîfor the first time in 2008, representing the Diamonds in both the 50-over and 20-over forms of the game. She bowled economically in the Twenty20 semi-final, helping to limit the Sapphires to 123, which Diamonds chased down successfully with a ball to spare. She remained economical in the final, but despite restricting the Rubies to 110, Diamonds could only reach 106 in their reply. In three 50-over Super Fours matches, she was less effective; her only wicket coming in the first match. Returning to the County Championship, Westbury dropped down into the lower order batting, while at the same time seeing her workload with the ball increasing. Somerset were rewarded in the match against Lancashire when she claimed five-wickets in the innings for the first time to set up a 132 run win. She continued her form in the following match, claiming four wickets against Warwickshire, conceding only four runs. She finished the season as Somerset's leading wicket-taker, claiming her twelve wickets at an average of 6.41. Westbury also competed in the Junior Super Fours‚Äîfor 16- to 19-year-old female cricketers‚Äîtowards the end of the 2008 season. Appearing for Junior Emeralds, she improved as the tournament progressed, following up scores of 18 and 27 with the tournament's highest score, 89, in the final match. She finished as the competition's second- highest run-scorer. The 2009 County Championship campaign saw Westbury's form dip from the previous season. Playing in five of Somerset's ten matches, she scored 18 runs at an average under four, and her three wickets came at 38.66. Her performances in the Junior Super Fours, however, continued to improve with both bat and ball. Named as captain of the Junior Emeralds, Westbury led by example in the opening match, taking three wickets and limiting the Rubies to 21 runs off her eight overs, and then top-scoring with 37 for her side in their successful chase. She bowled even more economically in the following match, conceding 12 runs off 10 overs, once again claiming three wickets. Opening the batting for the Emeralds in their reply‚Äîas she had done in the first match‚Äîshe made 46 runs, sharing a partnership of 102 with fellow opener Beth MacGregor to help set up a seven wicket victory. The Emerald's final match saw the Sapphires score more effectively off her bowling, totalling 30 runs from her 10 overs, but Westbury replied with an unbeaten century to propel her side to another seven wicket win. Her 187 runs and 7 wickets ensured she finished the tournament as the most prolific batsman and bowler, as the Emeralds won after remaining undefeated. In January 2010, Westbury was named as part of the England Academy squad for the High Performance Camp in Bangalore, India. Westbury joined Middlesex in 2013, and was made captain the following year. In 2016, she signed for the Western Storm in the inaugural Kia Super League, but did not play a game. Personal life Westbury studied as an undergraduate at Hertford College, Oxford. In addition to her cricket career, she also played hockey for Oxford, achieving her Blue by playing in the Varsity Hockey Match against Cambridge in March 2010. In 2011, she was elected as President of the Oxford Union, having earlier served as the society's secretary. Westbury is a sports writer for The Daily Telegraph and broadcasts for the BBC.

Summary  Darry and his wife have an argument about whether men's or women's work is more difficult and challenge each other by switching roles for a day. The wife immediately takes off towards the meadow to do Darry's part of the job, while Darry starts procrastinating by comically trying to do exercise in time with the directions given by the gramophone but fails to do so.

When Darry realizes that he has wasted a lot of time, he starts getting down to business (that is household work). After a series of mishaps - broken crockery, bleeding nose, shattered windowpane, a fused light bulb, Barry's ruined spectacles, spilled oil from the oil drum and nearly getting pulled along with the tied heifer to the bank beside the house - Darry fails at doing housework (thus losing the challenge).

Life Gyula G√≥zon was born on 19 April 1885, in √ârsek√∫jv√°r, but grew up in Esztergom. With the mentoring of his brother, he could fulfill his dream of learning to be a singer actor at the actor school of Szidi R√°kosi in Budapest. After graduating, he joins a group touring the southern part of the country, often working under harsh conditions, changing location and repertory often. During this period he has the chance to polish his prosaic capabilities, one that was omitted in R√°kosi's school. After playing in T√¢rgu Mure≈ü and Miercurea Ciuc, he gains the attention of Mikl√≥s Erd√©lyi, the director of Oradea's theater, who offers him contract in 1904. He plays here for six years, and befriends Gyula Kabos, forming a lifelong comradeship, and comedic duo. In 1912 Endre Nagy offers him to join his newly forming Cabaret (Apoll√≥ theatre) in Budapest, followed by years working in the N√©popera and Kir√°ly Theatre. G√≥zon accepted his first movie role in 1914 (the silent film A becsapott √∫js√°g√≠r√≥), appearing nearly a hundred during his lifetime. In 1917 he marries Lili Berky, with whom he starts the Musk√°tli Cabaret, often appearing on stage together. After the venture failed in 1920, he joins the Belv√°rosi Theatre in 1927, followed by the √öj Theatre two years later. With Gyula Kabos he gets a role in K√©k B√°lv√°ny, Hungary's first major motion picture, and like his mate, G√≥zon quickly becomes a much used actor of the emerging movie industry, appearing in the first hits of Budapest's theatres, like Hyppolit a lak√°j or Meseaut√≥. In 1935, along with his wife, he is contracted to the National Theatre). On the account of Jew-laws, he is banned from work in 1941, followed by years of hiding in his R√°kosliget home during World War II. In 1945 G√≥zon re-joins the National Theatre, enjoying a second flowering of his career for a decade. After his wife's death in 1958, the health of the now 73-year-old actor began to fail, and seven years after his last appearance in the National Theatre, he died on 8 October 1972. Legacy Gyula G√≥zon is one of the few entertainers who could be successful and active all along the years of the Monarchy, the Horthy regime, and the Communist rule. Throughout his long career, he appeared in over 90 movies (including silent ones), and was both a pioneer and master of the Hungarian Cabaret. He received the Kossuth Prize in 1954.

Impacts can result in erosion, sinkholes, loss of biodiversity, or the contamination of soil, groundwater, and surface water by the chemicals emitted from mining processes. These processes also have an impact on the atmosphere from the emissions of carbon which have effect on the quality of human health and biodiversity. Some mining methods may have such significant environmental and public health effects that mining companies in some countries are required to follow strict environmental and rehabilitation codes to ensure that the mined area returns to its original state.  Erosion  Erosion of exposed hillsides, mine dumps, tailings dams and resultant siltation of drainages, creeks and rivers can significantly impact the surrounding areas, a prime example being the giant Ok Tedi Mine in Papua New Guinea. In wilderness areas mining may cause destruction of ecosystems and habitats, and in areas of farming it may disturb or destroy productive grazing and croplands.  Sinkholes  House in 188x188px A sinkhole at or near a mine site is typically caused from the failure of a mine roof from the extraction of resources, weak overburden or geological discontinuities. The overburden at the mine site can develop cavities in the subsoil or rock, which can infill with sand and soil from the overlying strata. These cavities in the overburden have the potential to eventually cave in, forming a sinkhole at the surface. The sudden failure of earth creates a large depression at the surface without warning, this can be seriously hazardous to life and property. Sinkholes at a mine site can be mitigated with the proper design of infrastructure such as mining supports and better construction of walls to create a barrier around an area prone to sinkholes. Back-filling and grouting can be done to stabilize abandoned underground workings. Water pollution Mining can have harmful effects on surrounding surface and groundwater. If proper precautions are not taken, unnaturally high concentrations of chemicals, such as arsenic, sulfuric acid, and mercury over a significant area of surface or subsurface water. With large amounts of water used for mine drainage, mine cooling, aqueous extraction and other mining processes, increases the potential for these chemicals to contaminate ground and surface water. As mining produces copious amounts of waste water, disposal methods are limited due to contaminates within the waste water. Runoff containing these chemicals can lead to the devastation of the surrounding vegetation. The dumping of the runoff in surface waters or in a lot of forests is the worst option. Therefore, submarine tailings disposal are regarded as a better option (if the waste is pumped to great depth). Land storage and refilling of the mine after it has been depleted is even better, if no forests need to be cleared for the storage of debris. The contamination of watersheds resulting from the leakage of chemicals also has an effect on the health of the local population. In well- regulated mines, hydrologists and geologists take careful measurements of water to take precaution to exclude any type of water contamination that could be caused by the mine's operations. The minimization of environmental degradation is enforced in American mining practices by federal and state law, by restricting operators to meet standards for the protection of surface and groundwater from contamination.The principal federal laws are: * Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (solid waste management and groundwater protection). , * Clean Water Act (surface water pollution control). , This is best done through the use of non-toxic extraction processes as bioleaching. =Acid rock drainage= Sub-surface mining often progresses below the water table, so water must be constantly pumped out of the mine in order to prevent flooding. When a mine is abandoned, the pumping ceases, and water floods the mine. This introduction of water is the initial step in most acid rock drainage situations.Acid mine drainage in Portugal. Acid rock drainage occurs naturally within some environments as part of the rock weathering process but is exacerbated by large-scale earth disturbances characteristic of mining and other large construction activities, usually within rocks containing an abundance of sulfide minerals. Areas where the earth has been disturbed (e.g. construction sites, subdivisions, and transportation corridors) may create acid rock drainage. In many localities, the liquid that drains from coal stocks, coal handling facilities, coal washeries, and coal waste tips can be highly acidic, and in such cases it is treated as acid mine drainage (AMD). The same type of chemical reactions and processes may occur through the disturbance of acid sulfate soils formed under coastal or estuarine conditions after the last major sea level rise, and constitutes a similar environmental hazard. The five principal technologies used to monitor and control water flow at mine sites are diversion systems, containment ponds, groundwater pumping systems, subsurface drainage systems, and subsurface barriers. In the case of AMD, contaminated water is generally pumped to a treatment facility that neutralizes the contaminants. A 2006 review of environmental impact statements found that \\"water quality predictions made after considering the effects of mitigation largely underestimated actual impacts to groundwater, seeps, and surface water\\".Maest et al. 2006. Predicted Versus Actual Water Quality at Hardrock Mine Sites: Effect of Inherent Geochemical and Hydrologic Characteristics. =Heavy metals= Dissolution and transport of metals and heavy metals by run-off and ground water is another example of environmental problems with mining, such as the Britannia Mine, a former copper mine near Vancouver, British Columbia. Tar Creek, an abandoned mining area in Picher, Oklahoma that is now an Environmental Protection Agency Superfund site, also suffers from heavy metal contamination. Water in the mine containing dissolved heavy metals such as lead and cadmium leaked into local groundwater, contaminating it. Long-term storage of tailings and dust can lead to additional problems, as they can be easily blown off site by wind, as occurred at Skouriotissa, an abandoned copper mine in Cyprus. Environmental changes such as global warming and increased mining activity may increase the content of heavy metals in the stream sediments. Effect on biodiversity The Ok Tedi River is contaminated by tailings from a nearby mine. The implantation of a mine is a major habitat modification, and smaller perturbations occur on a larger scale than exploitation site, mine-waste residuals contamination of the environment for example. Adverse effects can be observed long after the end of the mine activity. Destruction or drastic modification of the original site and anthropogenic substances release can have major impact on biodiversity in the area. Destruction of the habitat is the main component of biodiversity losses, but direct poisoning caused by mine-extracted material, and indirect poisoning through food and water, can also affect animals, vegetation and microorganisms. Habitat modification such as pH and temperature modification disturb communities in the surrounding area. Endemic species are especially sensitive, since they require very specific environmental conditions. Destruction or slight modification of their habitat put them at the risk of extinction. Habitats can be damaged when there is not enough terrestrial product as well as by non-chemical products, such as large rocks from the mines that are discarded in the surrounding landscape with no concern for impacts on natural habitat. Concentrations of heavy metals are known to decrease with distance from the mine, and effects on biodiversity tend to follow the same pattern. Impacts can vary greatly depending on mobility and bioavailability of the contaminant: less-mobile molecules will stay inert in the environment while highly mobile molecules will easily move into another compartment or be taken up by organisms. For example, speciation of metals in sediments could modify their bioavailability, and thus their toxicity for aquatic organisms. Biomagnification plays an important role in polluted habitats: mining impacts on biodiversity, assuming that concentration levels are not high enough to directly kill exposed organisms, should be greater to the species on top of the food chain because of this phenomenon. Adverse mining effects on biodiversity depend a great extent on the nature of the contaminant, the level of concentration at which it can be found in the environment, and the nature of the ecosystem itself. Some species are quite resistant to anthropogenic disturbances, while some others will completely disappear from the contaminated zone. Time alone does not seem to allow the habitat to recover completely from the contamination. Remediation practices take time, and in most cases will not enable the recovery of the original diversity present before the mining activity took place. Aquatic organisms The mining industry can impact aquatic biodiversity through different ways. One way can be direct poisoning; a higher risk for this occurs when contaminants are mobile in the sediment or bioavailable in the water. Mine drainage can modify water pH, making it hard to differentiate direct impact on organisms from impacts caused by pH changes. Effects can nonetheless be observed and proven to be caused by pH modifications. Contaminants can also affect aquatic organisms through physical effects: streams with high concentrations of suspended sediment limit light, thus diminishing algae biomass. Metal oxide deposition can limit biomass by coating algae or their substrate, thereby preventing colonization. Contaminated Osisko lake in Rouyn- Noranda Factors that impact communities in acid mine drainage sites vary temporarily and seasonally: temperature, rainfall, pH, salinisation and metal quantity all display variations on the long term, and can heavily affect communities. Changes in pH or temperature can affect metal solubility, and thereby the bioavailable quantity that directly impact organisms. Moreover, contamination persists over time: ninety years after a pyrite mine closure, water pH was still very low and microorganisms populations consisted mainly of acidophil bacteria. One big case study that was considered extremely toxic to aquatic organisms was the contamination that occurred in Minamata Bay. Methylmercury was released into wastewater by industrial chemical company's and a disease called Minamata disease was discovered in Kumamoto, Japan. This resulted in mercury poisoning in fishes and shellfishes and it was contaminating surrounding species and many died from it and it impacted anyone that ate the contaminated fishes. =Microorganisms= Algae communities are less diverse in acidic water containing high zinc concentration, and mine drainage stress decrease their primary production. Diatoms' community is greatly modified by any chemical change, pH phytoplankton assemblage, and high metal concentration diminishes the abundance of planktonic species. Some diatom species may grow in high-metal-concentration sediments. In sediments close to the surface, cysts suffer from corrosion and heavy coating. In very polluted conditions, total algae biomass is quite low, and the planktonic diatom community is missing. In case of functional complementary, however, it is possible that the phytoplankton and zooplankton mass remains stable. =Macroorganisms= Water insect and crustacean communities are modified around a mine, resulting in a low trophic completeness and their community being dominated by predators. However, biodiversity of macroinvertebrates can remain high, if sensitive species are replaced with tolerant ones. When diversity within the area is reduced, there is sometimes no effect of stream contamination on abundance or biomass, suggesting that tolerant species fulfilling the same function take the place of sensible species in polluted sites. pH diminution in addition to elevated metal concentration can also have adverse effects on macroinvertebrates' behaviour, showing that direct toxicity is not the only issue. Fish can also be affected by pH, temperature variations, and chemical concentrations. no Terrestrial organisms=Vegetation= Soil texture and water content can be greatly modified in disturbed sites, leading to plants community changes in the area. Most of the plants have a low concentration tolerance for metals in the soil, but sensitivity differs among species. Grass diversity and total coverage is less affected by high contaminant concentration than forbs and shrubs. Mine waste- materials rejects or traces due to mining activity can be found in the vicinity of the mine, sometimes far away from the source. Established plants cannot move away from perturbations, and will eventually die if their habitat is contaminated by heavy metals or metalloids at a concentration that is too elevated for their physiology. Some species are more resistant and will survive these levels, and some non-native species that can tolerate these concentrations in the soil, will migrate in the surrounding lands of the mine to occupy the ecological niche. Plants can be affected through direct poisoning, for example arsenic soil content reduces bryophyte diversity. Soil acidification through pH diminution by chemical contamination can also lead to a diminished species number. Contaminants can modify or disturb microorganisms, thus modifying nutrient availability, causing a loss of vegetation in the area. Some tree roots divert away from deeper soil layers in order to avoid the contaminated zone, therefore lacking anchorage within the deep soil layers, resulting in the potential uprooting by the wind when their height and shoot weight increase. In general, root exploration is reduced in contaminated areas compared to non-polluted ones. Plant species diversity will remain lower in reclaimed habitats than in undisturbed areas. Cultivated crops might be a problem near mines. Most crops can grow on weakly contaminated sites, but yield is generally lower than it would have been in regular growing conditions. Plants also tend to accumulate heavy metals in their aerian organs, possibly leading to human intake through fruits and vegetables. Regular consumption of contaminated crops might lead to health problems caused by long-term metal exposure. Cigarettes made from tobacco growing on contaminated sites might also possibly have adverse effects on human population, as tobacco tends to accumulate cadmium and zinc in its leaves. =Animals= Malartic mine - Osisko Habitat destruction is one of the main issues of mining activity. Huge areas of natural habitat are destroyed during mine construction and exploitation, forcing animals to leave the site. Animals can be poisoned directly by mine products and residuals. Bioaccumulation in the plants or the smaller organisms they eat can also lead to poisoning: horses, goats and sheep are exposed in certain areas to potentially toxic concentration of copper and lead in grass. There are fewer ant species in soil containing high copper levels, in the vicinity of a copper mine. If fewer ants are found, chances are higher that other organisms living in the surrounding landscape are strongly affected by the high copper levels as well. Ants have good judgement whether an area is habitual as they live directly in the soil and are thus sensitive to environmental disruptions. =Microorganisms= Microorganisms are extremely sensitive to environmental modification, such as modified pH, temperature changes or chemical concentrations due to their size. For example, the presence of arsenic and antimony in soils have led to diminution in total soil bacteria. Much like waters sensitivity, a small change in the soil pH can provoke the remobilization of contaminants, in addition to the direct impact on pH-sensitive organisms. Microorganisms have a wide variety of genes among their total population, so there is a greater chance of survival of the species due to the resistance or tolerance genes in that some colonies possess, as long as modifications are not too extreme. Nevertheless, survival in these conditions will imply a big loss of gene diversity, resulting in a reduced potential for adaptations to subsequent changes. Undeveloped soil in heavy metal contaminated areas could be a sign of reduced activity by soils microfauna and microflora, indicating a reduced number of individuals or diminished activity. Twenty years after disturbance, even in rehabilitation area, microbial biomass is still greatly reduced compared to undisturbed habitat. Arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi are especially sensitive to the presence of chemicals, and the soil is sometimes so disturbed that they are no longer able to associate with root plants. However, some fungi possess contaminant accumulation capacity and soil cleaning ability by changing the biodisponibility of pollutants, this can protect plants from potential damages that could be caused by chemicals. Their presence in contaminated sites could prevent loss of biodiversity due to mine-waste contamination, or allow for bioremediation, the removal of undesired chemicals from contaminated soils. On the contrary, some microbes can deteriorate the environment: which can lead to elevated SO4 in the water and can also increase microbial production of hydrogen sulfide, a toxin for many aquatic plants and organisms.  Rubbish = Tailings = Mining processes produce an excess of waste materials known as tailings. The materials that are left over after are a result of separating the valuable fraction from the uneconomic fraction of ore. These large amounts of waste are a mixture of water, sand, clay, and residual bitumen. Tailings are commonly stored in tailings ponds made from naturally existing valleys or large engineered dams and dyke systems. Tailings ponds can remain part of an active mine operation for 30-40 years. This allows for tailings deposits to settle, or for storage and water recycling. Tailings have great potential to damage the environment by releasing toxic metals by acid mine drainage or by damaging aquatic wildlife; these both require constant monitoring and treatment of water passing through the dam. However, the greatest danger of tailings ponds is dam failure. Tailings ponds are typically formed by locally derived fills (soil, coarse waste, or overburden from mining operations and tailings) and the dam walls are often built up on to sustain greater amounts of tailings. The lack of regulation for design criteria of the tailings ponds are what put the environment at risk for flooding from the tailings ponds. = Spoil tip = A spoil tip is a pile of accumulated overburden that was removed from a mine site during the extraction of coal or ore. These waste materials are composed of ordinary soil and rocks, with the potential to be contaminated with chemical waster. Spoil is much different from tailings, as it is processed material that remains after the valuable components have been extracted from ore. Spoil tip combustion can happen fairly commonly as, older spoil tips tend to be loose and tip over the edge of a pile. As spoil is mainly composed of carbonaceous material that is highly combustible, it can be accidentally ignited by the lighting fire or the tipping of hot ashes. Spoil tips can often catch fire and be left burning underground or within the spoil piles for many years. Effects of mine pollution on humans Humans are also affected by mining. There are many diseases that can come from the pollutants that are released into the air and water during the mining process. For example, during smelting operations large quantities of air pollutants, such as the suspended particulate matter, SOx, arsenic particles and cadmium, are emitted. Metals are usually emitted into the air as particulates as well. There are also many occupational health hazards that miners face. Most of miners suffer from various respiratory and skin diseases such as asbestosis, silicosis, or black lung disease. Furthermore, one of the biggest subset of mining that impacts humans is the pollutants that end up in the water, which results in poor water quality. About 30% of the world has access to renewable freshwater which is used by industries that generate large amounts of waste containing chemicals in various concentrations that are deposited into the freshwater. The concern of active chemicals in the water can pose a great risk to human health as it can accumulate within the water and fishes. There was a study done on an abandon mine in China, Dabaoshan mine and this mine was not active to many years yet the impact of how metals can accumulate in water and soil was a major concern for neighboring villages. Due to the lack of proper care of waste materials 56% of mortality rate is estimated within the regions around this mining sites, and many have been diagnosed with esophageal cancer and liver cancer. It resulted that this mine till this day still has negative impacts on human health through crops and it is evident that there needs to be more cleaning up measures around surrounding areas. Coal mining The environmental factors of the coal industry are not only impacting air pollution, water management and land use but also is causing severe health effects by the burning of the coal. Air pollution is increasing in numbers of toxins such as mercury, lead, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and other heavy metals. This is causing health issues involving breathing difficulties and is impacting the wildlife around the surrounding areas that needs clean air to survive. The future of air pollution remains unclear as the Environmental Protection Agency have tried to prevent some emissions but don't have control measures in place for all plants producing mining of coal. Water pollution is another factor that is being damaged throughout this process of mining coals, the ashes from coal is usually carried away in rainwater which streams into larger water sites. It can take up to 10 years to clean water sites that have coal waste and the potential of damaging clean water can only make the filtration much more difficult. Deforestation With open cast mining the overburden, which may be covered in forest, must be removed before the mining can commence. Although the deforestation due to mining may be small compared to the total amount it may lead to species extinction if there is a high level of local endemism. The lifecycle of mining coal is one of the filthiest cycles that causes deforestation due to the amount of toxins, and heavy metals that are released soil and water environment.Prasad, Siva, T Byragi Reddy, and Ramesh Vadde. 2015. ‚ÄúEnvironmental Aspects and Impacts Its Mitigation Measures of Corporate Coal Mining‚Äù 11: 2‚Äì7. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.proeps.2015.06.002. Although the effects of coal mining take a long time to impact the environment the burning of coals and fires which can burn up to decades can release flying ash and increase the greenhouse gasses. Specifically strip mining that can destroy landscapes, forests, and wildlife habitats that are near the sites.Prasad, Siva, T Byragi Reddy, and Ramesh Vadde. 2015. ‚ÄúEnvironmental Aspects and Impacts Its Mitigation Measures of Corporate Coal Mining‚Äù 11: 2‚Äì7. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.proeps.2015.06.002. Trees, plants and topsoil are cleared from the mining area and this can lead to destruction of agricultural land. Furthermore, when rainfall occurs the ashes and other materials are washed into streams that can hurt fish. These impacts can still occur after the mining site is completed which disturbs the presences of the land and restoration of the deforestation takes longer than usual because the quality of the land is degraded.Prasad, Siva, T Byragi Reddy, and Ramesh Vadde. 2015. ‚ÄúEnvironmental Aspects and Impacts Its Mitigation Measures of Corporate Coal Mining‚Äù 11: 2‚Äì7. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.proeps.2015.06.002. Oil shale Oil shale is a sedimentary rock containing kerogen which hydrocarbons can be produced. Mining oil shale impacts the environment it can damage the biological land and ecosystems. The thermal heating and combustion generate a lot of material and waste that includes carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas. Many environmentalists are against the production and usage of oil shale because it creates large amounts of greenhouse gasses. Among air pollution, water contamination is a huge factor mainly because oil shales are dealing with oxygen and hydrocarbons. There is changes in the landscape with mining sites due to oil shale mining and the production using chemical products. Toomik, Arvi, and Valdo Liblik. 1998. ‚ÄúOil Shale Mining and Processing Impact on Landscapes in North-East Estonia‚Äù 41: 285‚Äì92. The ground movements within the area of underground mining is a problem that is long-term because it causes non-stabilized areas. Underground mining causes a new formation that can be suitable for some plant growth, but rehabilitation could be required. Toomik, Arvi, and Valdo Liblik. 1998. ‚ÄúOil Shale Mining and Processing Impact on Landscapes in North-East Estonia‚Äù 41: 285‚Äì92. Mountaintop removal miningSand mining Sand mining and gravel mining creates large pits and fissures in the earth's surface. At times, mining can extend so deeply that it affects ground water, springs, underground wells, and the water table. Mitigation To ensure completion of reclamation, or restoring mine land for future use, many governments and regulatory authorities around the world require that mining companies post a bond to be held in escrow until productivity of reclaimed land has been convincingly demonstrated, although if cleanup procedures are more expensive than the size of the bond, the bond may simply be abandoned. Since 1978 the mining industry has reclaimed more than 2 million acres (8,000 km2) of land in the United States alone. This reclaimed land has renewed vegetation and wildlife in previous mining lands and can even be used for farming and ranching.

It opened in 1946 and closed in 1958.  History  The Wycombe Repertory Theatre opened on 16 December 1946, an event attended by Hugh Williams.Dewey, pp. 1-2 The original management consisted of director Ian Dobbie, production manager Nick Simms, stage manager Jack Stone, and catering manager Edward Shoesmith, the four of whom had served with the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers during World War II. The first play at the Wycombe was Gerald Savoy's George and Margaret. The theatre contained approximately 300 seats.Rowntree, p. 395 In March 1952 the theatre, which had undergone various personnel changes since its opening, was renamed to the Tower Theatre. In June 1953, an appeal was made for increased attendance in order to keep the theatre open. Though the theatre did indeed remain open, it was taken over in August of that year by George Radford. The first play produced under this new management was The Gioconda Smile.Dewey, p. 3 In 1954, management of the theatre changed hands to actor-producer Neil Gibson. The theatre was renamed once again in 1955, this time to the Intimate Theatre. The theatre went on to experience financial difficulties throughout the late 1950s. Attempts to remedy these difficulties included subscription- based ticket sales, the opening of a membership-only licensed bar, and a Supporters' Club dance. While these activities were successful in their own right, they did little to improve the financial situation of the theatre. In April 1957, Gibson announced that he was closing the theatre for the summer.Dewey, p. 4 The theatre reopened in July 1957. Despite various attempts to draw in larger crowds, the theatre's financial difficulties continued through 1958. In December of that year, Gibson announced the final closure of the theatre after having presented nearly 400 shows in its 12 years of operation.Dewey, p. 6  Notes  References  Former theatres in England 1946 establishments in England 1958 disestablishments in England History of Buckinghamshire High Wycombe ","title":"Wycombe Repertory Theatre"},{"id":"23754915","title":"Sam Harper"},{"id":"23754919","text":"Basil Norton Ashmore (13 September 1915 - January 1998Ancestry.com) was a British theatrical director and author.

Stu McKinlay and Sam Possenniskie established it in 2008. The brewery's name is a play on that of the band Beastie Boys. Yeastie Boys have a roster of three regular beers which they produce year round, and also produce a limited release of seasonal beers which they release each spring, summer, autumn and winter. Yeastie Boys themselves do not practice beer and food matching, instead choosing to match their beers with music, films, places or people. Stu McKinlay in Wellington, New Zealand develops Yeastie Boys beers. The beers are commercially produced at the Urbanaut Brewery in Auckland, New Zealand, and in the UK for the European market.
