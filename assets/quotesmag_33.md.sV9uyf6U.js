Homotopy continuation The primary computational method used in numerical algebraic geometry is homotopy continuation, in which a homotopy is formed between two polynomial systems, and the isolated solutions (points) of one are continued to the other. This is a specification of the more general method of numerical continuation. Let z represent the variables of the system. By abuse of notation, and to facilitate the spectrum of ambient spaces over which one can solve system, we do not use vector notation for z. Similarly for the polynomial systems f and g. Current canonical notation calls the start system g, and the target system, i.e., the system to solve, f. A very common homotopy, the straight-line homotopy, between f and g is H(z,t) = (1-t) f(z) + t g(z). In the above homotopy, one starts the path variable at t_{\\\\text{start}} = 1 and continues toward t_{\\\\text{end}} = 0. Another common choice is to run from 0 to 1. In principle, the choice is completely arbitrary. In practice, regarding endgame methods for computing singular solutions using homotopy continuation, the target time being 0 can significantly ease analysis, so this perspective is here taken. Regardless of the choice of start and target times, the H ought to be formulated such that H(z, t_{\\\\text{start}}) = g(z), and H(z, t_{\\\\text{end}}) = f(z). One has a choice in g(z), including * Roots of unity * Total degree * Polyhedral * Multi-homogeneous and beyond these, specific start systems that closely mirror the structure of f may be formed for particular systems. The choice of start system impacts the computational time it takes to solve f, in that those that are easy to formulate (such as total degree) tend to have higher numbers of paths to track, and those that take significant effort (such as the polyhedral method) are much sharper. There is currently no good way to predict which will lead to the quickest time to solve. Actual continuation is typically done using predictor‚Äìcorrector methods, with additional features as implemented. Predicting is done using a standard ODE predictor method, such as Runge‚ÄìKutta, and correction often uses Newton‚ÄìRaphson iteration. Because f and g are polynomial, homotopy continuation in this context is theoretically guaranteed to compute all solutions of f, due to Bertini's theorem. However, this guarantee is not always achieved in practice, because of issues arising from limitations of the modern computer, most namely finite precision. That is, despite the strength of the probability-1 argument underlying this theory, without using a priori certified tracking methods, some paths may fail to track perfectly for various reasons. Witness set A witness set W is a data structure used to describe algebraic varieties. The witness set for an affine variety that is equidimensional consists of three pieces of information. The first piece of information is a system of equations F. These equations define the algebraic variety {\\\\mathbf V}(F) that is being studied. The second piece of information is a linear space \\\\mathcal{L}. The dimension of \\\\mathcal{L} is the codimension of {\\\\mathbf V}(F), and chosen to intersect {\\\\mathbf V}(F) transversely. The third piece of information is the list of points in the intersection \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\cap{\\\\mathbf V}(F). This intersection has finitely many points and the number of points is the degree of the algebraic variety {\\\\mathbf V}(F). Thus, witness sets encode the answer to the first two questions one asks about an algebraic variety: What is the dimension, and what is the degree? Witness sets also allow one to perform a numerical irreducible decomposition, component membership tests, and component sampling. This makes witness sets a good description of an algebraic variety. Certification Solutions to polynomial systems computed using numerical algebraic geometric methods can be certified, meaning that the approximate solution is \\"correct\\". This can be achieved in several ways, either a priori using a certified tracker, or a posteriori by showing that the point is, say, in the basin of convergence for Newton's method.

Friends of the River was founded in 1973 by Mark Dubois and Jerry Meral during the struggle to save the Stanislaus River from New Melones Dam. Some believe that the campaign to save the Stanislaus River marked the end of massive dam building in the United States, making the Stanislaus River the \\"last river lost\\". Many photographs, documents, and other materials relating to this failed campaign are available online at the Stanislaus River Digital Archive. Following that campaign, the group branched out to work to protect other California rivers. The mission of Friends of the River is to preserve and restore California's rivers, streams, and their watersheds; as well as to advocate for sustainable water management. Today, Friends of the River, a 501(c)3 organization, has nearly 6,000 members, 12 staff members, and a 12-member Board of Directors. The organization's 2009 budget was $1.06 million. The organization's flagship publication, Headwaters, is published bi-annually, and has a distribution of 6,000. Friends of the River is based in Sacramento with field offices in Monterey and Valencia. In 2005, Friends of the River joined with the Sierra Club and the South Yuba River Citizens League to file a motion with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to require the managers of Oroville Dam in California to lay concrete on the emergency spillway. The motion was rejected, and approximately 12 years later the emergency spillway was used and began to erode, threatening the dam with potential collapse. Oroville and the surrounding area were evacuated.  Evaluations  Charity Navigator gives the organization four stars out of four for accountability and transparency and three out of four stars overall. In fiscal year ending 12/2014, the organization spent 69.5% of its revenue on program expenses, 13.9% on administrative expenses, and 16.6% on fundraising expenses.

Celebrated on 7 January, it was established by Law 671 on 31 December 1996. It is intended as a celebration, though not a public holiday.Celebrazione nazionale del bicentenario della prima bandiera nazionale Legge n. 671 del 31 dicembre 1996 (GU 1 del 2 gennaio 1997) The official celebration of the day is held in Reggio Emilia, the city where the Italian tricolour was first adopted by an Italian sovereign state, the Cispadane Republic, on 7 January 1797. History Flag of the Cispadane Republic The day was established by law n. 671 of 31 December 1996 with the intention of celebrating the bicentenary of the birth in Reggio nell'Emilia of the Italian flag, which officially took place, as already mentioned, on 7 January 1797 with the official adoption of the Tricolour by the Cispadana Republic, a Napoleonic state born the previous year and dependent on the French First Republic. Previously, the Italian national colours had already appeared on the tricolour cockades and on some military banners but on 7 January 1797, for the first time, the Tricolour was officially adopted by an Italian sovereign State. To suggest the adoption of a green, white and red flag was Giuseppe Compagnoni, who for this reason is known as the \\"Father of the Tricolour\\". In the minutes of the meeting of 7 January 1797 which was convened by the founding committee of the Cispadane Republic and which took place in a room of the town hall later renamed Sala del Tricolore, it can be readThe tri-coloured standard.Getting to Know Italy, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (retrieved 5 October 2008) : Sala del Tricolore, later to become the council hall of the municipality of Reggio Emilia, where the Italian flag was born In the assembly of 21 January, which was instead convened in Modena, the adoption of the Tricolour was confirmed. The flag of the Cispadane Republic was in horizontal bands with the top red, the white in the center and the green at the bottom. In the center was also the emblem of the republic, while on the sides the letters \\"R\\" and \\"C\\" were shown, the initials of the two words that form the name of the \\"Repubblica Cispadana\\". The Cispadane and Transpadana republics merged a few months later to form the Cisalpine Republic, whose Grand Council, on 11 May 1798, adopted a tricolour flag in vertical bands with no crests, emblems or letters. Later the green, white and red flag was adopted by two other Napoleonic states, the Italian Republic and the subsequent Kingdom of Italy. After the Napoleonic era, the Tricolour became a symbol of the Risorgimento struggle. It was in fact adopted by the Cittadella of Alessandria during the revolutions of 1820 and by the Roman Republic in 1849. In 1860 the Italian flag was chosen as the national flag by the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, while on 17 March 1861, with the proclamation of the Kingdom of Italy, the green, white and red flag became the national flag of a united Italy, although not officially recognized by a specific law. The recognition took place on 12 June 1946 thanks to a legislative decree of the President of the Council of Ministers of the Italian Republic, where the Tricolour was officially adopted as the national flag of the newly formed Italian Republic. The decision was ratified on March 24, 1947 by the Constituent Assembly of Italy which decreed, at the same time, the insertion, in article 12 of the Constitution of the Italian Republic, of the following text: Celebrations Solemn change of the Guard of Honor of the Corazzieri Regiment at the Quirinale Palace in Rome on the occasion of the Tricolour Day on 7 January 2016 On December 31, 1996, with the same law that established the Tricolour Festival, a National Committee of twenty members was set up with the aim of organizing the first solemn commemoration of the birth of the Italian flagArticle 1 of the law n. 671 of 31 December 1996 (\\"National celebration of the bicentenary of the first national flag\\"). The Committee was composed of institutional personalities, including the presidents of the chambers, and members from civil society, particularly from the historical and cultural sphere. At that time it was also proposed not to celebrate the date, or even to modify the flag itself, hypotheses scarcely accepted by the members of the Parliament. In Reggio nell'Emilia, the Festa del Tricolore is celebrated in Piazza Prampolini, in front of the town hall, in the presence of one of the highest offices of the Italian Republic (the President of the Italian Republic or the president of one of the chambers), who attends the 'flag-raising on the notes of Il Canto degli Italiani and which renders military honors a reproduction of the flag of the Cispadane Republic. In Rome, at the Quirinal Palace, the ceremonial foresees instead the change of the Guard of honour in solemn form with the deployment and the parade of the Corazzieri Regiment in gala uniform and the Fanfare of the Carabinieri Cavalry Regiment. This solemn rite is carried out only on three other occasions, during the celebrations of the Anniversary of the Unification of Italy (17 March), of the Festa della Repubblica (2 June) and of the National Unity and Armed Forces Day (4 November).

The second season of Doble Kara chronicles the lives of Kara Dela Rosa and Sara Suarez now that Kara's adoptive mother, Lucille Dela Rosa, knows the truth about Antonio's infidelity and the real identities of Kara and Sara. Kara also develops a friendship with Sebastian Acosta, Lucille's half-brother. Meanwhile, the Suarez family continues to struggles while Lucille constantly plans schemes against them along with her accomplice, her half-sister, Alex Acosta, who wants her inheritance in exchange. Plot Edward (Edgar Allan Guzman) meets Kara (Julia Montes) again for a second time and it was already known to him that Kara and Sara (Julia Montes) are twins. Edward uncertainly get his eyes on Kara and she will soon taste the bitterness and cruelty of her twin sister. Rivalry arises between them with both twins fighting for their rights and ownership. But even so, Kara's love for her sister is unconditional as she gives everything to Sara to make her happy and satisfied, even knowing her sister has started to be more evil. In few times later, Kara uncovered her feelings for Edward and realized for herself that she doesn't see him beyond a friend. She meets her new savior, Sebastian (Sam Milby), who stopped her from committing suicide and helped her with her family problems. They became best friends and now it is Edward who seeks attention to Kara and gets envious of Sebastian. Sara later promised Edward that she will always be there for him. Sara began to be much more materialistic and scheming, and persistently fights for her rights as the \\"legal daughter\\" of Antonio (Allen Dizon). This later started a hefty and exasperating rivalry between Sara and Lucille (Carmina Villarroel). Sara started to covet for highly luxurious properties, desiring to outclass Kara for all the lavishness she used to have, and even induced Antonio to buy her own house to make up for all those years she suffered in scarcity. After the struggles that Kara has faced, every pieces of their family's secrets are finally discovered by Lucille who had known nothing about her family's well-kept secrets because of Sara's intentional declaration and evil schemes. Even her mother, Barbara (Alicia Alonzo), pretends innocently and blames Kara for falling down from a stair. Lucille was saddened by these turn of events, but chose to forgive her family and wanted them to move with her to America again for a fresh start. Unfortunately, Lucille's revenge returns and aggravates when Antonio dies in a car accident and her road to revenge is nearly arriving and she couldn't stop until she finds justice for the death of her husband. This enabled Sara to pay for her evil schemes she had caused against her family and Lucille as well. It becomes worse for Lucille when another secret from her mother is about to shock her when she meets her conniving and two-faced half-sister Alex (Maxene Magalona) and half- brother Sebastian. Lucille ordered a demolition around the area where the Suarez family lives and forcefully expelled Sara to the house which Antonio gave her. In consequence of the casualty, Ishmael (Ariel Rivera) who was badly wounded in the head and needed medical operation for his condition. Kara and Sara, nowhere to look for money, had no choice but to confront Lucille and demanded the \\"donation\\" which their late father left for them. Lucille displeasingly tells the twins that Antonio didn't left any money for them and this created a weird suspicion behind Sara's mind. The twin sisters confronted the attorney and fellow friend of Antonio, and upon their surprise the attorney had finally confessed that he was actually blackmailed by Lucille to hide the inheritance which Antonio left for his daughters. Kara and Sara were given a corresponding amount of money of ten million each and used these for Ishmael's operation.

Extensively educated and absorbed ascetic theologian, musicologist and philologist. While as a student in his pre-monastic period, he worked as a Greek language teacher, but also as a professor in Byzantine church music. While residing in the monastery Zograf(Mount Athos, Greece) founded the music school and the translation calligraphic literary school. As –∞ brilliant theorist of the nematic Byzantine musical tradition, furthermore composer and chanter on the one hand and an expert linguist in ancient Greek, Slavic, new Greek and Romanian language on the other hand, he created timeless masterpieces and translations, thereby enriching the cultural heritage spiritual barns of the Orthodox ecumene to the utmost. Kalistrat Zografski is likely to be regarded as the best connoisseur of Byzantine neumatic ladder, created by the famous ascetic, composer and chanter, St. John Kukuzel (12th century). He died in 1914, as Archimandrite of the monastery Zograf, in Mount Athos, Greece. Early life Born in Struga in 1821 as Krstan Sandzhak. It is assumed for him being primary educated in his hometown and beyond. There is evidence for him attending the music school of Naum Miladinov. However, in Zograf monastery on Mount Athos developed extensive and fruitful theoretical, composer's and translational work, providing a widespread reputation among connoisseurs of the Eastern church music. His contribution as a master of psaltic art Eastern Church Chants, Part 3, 1905, by Archimandrite Kalistrat Zografski Kalistrat's transcriptions of some of the Kukuzel's musical opus will be remembered as unsurpassed. He is the author of basic music literature as \\"Eastern church singing\\", published in four volumes, printed on Mount Athos in 1905 year. As a talented composer, he created several original compositions. The best known are the eucharistic canon \\"The Father and The Son ...\\" and \\"It's dignified\\" in different voices. As an editor of the monastic publishing records and as brilliant connoisseur in many classical and living languages, Kalistrat Zografski first translated and printed services of St. Kliment, St. Naum and Seven Saints, from Old Slavonic, encoded by the famous Moscopolski Code. He died in monastic Zograf's cell in 1914 year. Due to his humble, gnostic, ascetic life, he is considered as one of the most beloved clerics of the athonite monastery Zografos. His relics are today stored in Zograf's monastic ossuary. His contribution to music and philology is the subject of numerous studies in scientific circles. The most significant piece by Kalistrat Zografski is a collection Eastern church chants, in four volumes, which were published in Thessaloniki in 1905. Namely, it is noteworthy to point out his extensive engagement to the full implementation of this church-musical work: as a theorist, editor of the whole publication and translator for numerous variants of Greek and Romanian, and Slavic languages, including transcription of works, written in the Kukuzel's notation to the new Chrisantos neumatic ladder.

For a fixed set of genetic and environmental conditions, recombination in a particular region of a linkage structure (chromosome) tends to be constant and the same is then true for the crossover value which is used in the production of genetic map.King R. C., Stransfield W. D. (1998): Dictionary of genetics. Oxford University Press, New York, Oxford, ; . Origin in cell biology Crossover implies the exchange of chromosomal segments between non-sister chromatids, in meiosis during the production of gametes. The effect is to assort the alleles on parental chromosomes, so that the gametes carry recombinations of genes different from either parent. This has the overall effect of increasing the variety of phenotypes present in a population. The process of non-sister chromatide exchanges, including the crossover value, can be observed directly in stained cells, and indirectly by the presence or absence of genetic markers on the chromosomes. The visible crossovers are called chiasmata. The large-scale effect of crossover is to spread genetic variations within a population, as well as genetic basis for the selection of the most adaptable phenotypes. The crossover value depends on the mutual distance of the genetic loci observed. The crossover value is equal to the recombination value or fraction when the distance between the markers in question is short.

The maximum elevation reached is above sea level. The Beach Mountains occupy a roughly circular area with a diameter of approximately , rising above the surrounding desert. Narrow passes separate the Beach Mountains from the Baylor Mountains to the north and the much larger Sierra Diablo range to the northwest.Google Earth Geology The Beach mountain range is one of multiple isolated mountain ranges that populate Trans-Pecos Texas. Other nearby ranges include the Sierra Diablo, Baylor, Apache, Carrizo, Wylie, Eagle, and Van Horn mountains. Although these isolated ranges may share some common characteristics, their underlying geology can vary significantly. The Beach Mountains are erosional remnants of Ordovician and Cambrian sedimentary rocks laid down from 541 to 444 million years ago. Along their western margins, a highly intermittent stream called Hackberry Creek has exposed even older Precambrian deposits. Flora The vegetation of the Beach Mountains is typical of the Chihuahuan Desert with plants such as Yucca, creosote, mesquite, and various cactus species. The shallow soils along the steep and rocky slopes also support live oak, pinyon pine, juniper, and various grasses. Fauna The Beach Mountains are home to rare herds of desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni), which tend to be restricted to the mountainous parts of Trans-Pecos Texas and southeastern New Mexico.Bailey, V. 1912. A new subspecies of mountain sheep from western Texas and southeastern New Mexico. Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington 25:109-110. The many rugged escarpments and the highly dissected and eroded conditions within the Beach Mountains produce a rough and precipitous terrain that is highly favored by mountain sheep. Once extirpated, 38 desert bighorns were reintroduced into the Beach Mountains by the government of Texas in 1991 and 1992. In 2009, the Beach Mountains sheep formed part of a population numbering almost 1,200 in several mountain ranges in western Texas.Bailey, V. 1905. Biological survey of Texas.

The Lombard Legion (Legione Lombarda) was a military unit of the Cisalpine Republic which existed from 1796 until the Republic's fall in 1799. The Lombard Legion was the first Italian military department to equip itself, as a banner, with an Italian tricolor flag. History It was formed on 8 October 1796 by Napoleon Bonaparte, then commander of the Armee d'Italie. Its theoretical full strength was 3740 men made up of a hussar company, an artillery company and seven 500-man infantry cohorts (3 from Milan, 1 from Cremona and Casalmaggiore, 1 from Lodi and Pavia, 1 from Como and 1 miscellaneous cohort of Italian nationalists, mainly from the Papal States and the Kingdom of Sicily). It was commanded by the former Milanese nobleman, general Trivulzio and included Ugo Foscolo and Vincenzo Cuoco among its soldiers. 2720 had been recruited by 18 October and on 6 November 1796 it and several other units were ceremonially presented with their standards in the piazza outside Milan Cathedral - they were in red, white and green, which would become the national colours of Italy. The Lombard Legion was the first Italian military department to equip itself, as a banner, with a tricolor flag. It fought at the battle of Arcole on 15 November 1796 and then against papal forces on the river Senio. The Legion's fourth cohort joined Cisalpine troops to put down insurrections at Pesaro then at Urbino. By February 1797 it was stationed in Brescia and on 26 February 1797 it was reorganised into two demi-brigades of three cohorts, an artillery company and a hussar company and at the end of that year the Cisapadane Legion merged into it - that unit had been made up of 6 cohorts of 1,000 men and became the Lombard Legion's third demi-brigade. By then the Legion had been moved to Verona in support of French forces fighting in the Veneto before being divided up between Corfu, Peschiera and Friuli - the elements of the Legion still in Italy on the treaty of Campo Formio of 17 October 1797 returned to Lombardy. The Lombard Legion became part of the Cisalpine Army in April 1798, then made up of eight demi-brigades, though this had fallen to four by the following November. The Legion's fourth cohort was attached to General Jean √âtienne Championnet's army to fight in Naples in 1798 and the following year the Legion's second demi-brigade formed part of the army of Rome sent to attack the Kingdom of Naples under General Domenico Pino. It broke up after the Republic's fall in 1799 but some survivors from the unit moved to France, where they joined survivors from the armed forces of the Roman Republic and the Neapolitan Republic to form the Italic Legion (Legione Italica), also known as the Italian Legion (Legione Italica). This formed part of Bonaparte's reserve force for the second Italian campaign and fought the Austrians at Lecco.

Munitz (ed.), Identity and Individuation. New York University Press. pp. 135-164 (1971) although it was first derived by the logician Ruth Barcan Marcus in 1947,Marcus, Ruth Barcan, ‚ÄòIdentity of Individuals in a Strict Functional Calculus of Second Order‚Äô, Journal of Symbolic Logic, 1947, 12-15. and later, in simplified form, by W. V. O. Quine in 1953.Quine, W.V.O., ‚ÄòThree Grades of Modal Involvement‚Äô, Journal of Symbolic Logic, 1953, 168-169. Kripke's derivation The derivation in Kripke's 'Identity and Necessity' is in three steps: :(1) ‚àÄx nec(x = x) :(2) ‚àÄx‚àÄy(x = y ‚Üí (nec(x = x) ‚Üí nec(x = y))) :(3) ‚àÄx‚àÄy(x = y ‚Üí nec(x = y)) The first premiss is simply postulated: every object is identical to itself. The second is an application of the principle of substitutivity: if a = b, then a has all the properties b has, thus from Fa, infer Fb, where F is 'nec(a = --)'. The third follows by elementary predicate logic. =Rigid designation= In the later Naming and Necessity, Kripke suggested that the principle could be derived directly, assuming what he called rigid designation. A term is a rigid designator when it designates the same object in every possible world in which that object exists. When a name's referent is fixed by the original act of naming, it becomes a rigid designator. Some examples of rigid designators include proper names (i.e. ‚ÄòRichard Nixon‚Äô), natural kind terms ( i.e. ‚Äògold‚Äô or ‚ÄòH2O‚Äô) and some descriptions. Proper names are typically rigid designators, but definite descriptions are typically not. So we can speak of \\"Richard Nixon\\" referring to the same person in all possible worlds, but the description \\"the man who won the 1968 election\\" could refer to many different people. According to Kripke, the proper name \\"Richard Nixon\\" can only be used rigidly, but the description \\"the man who won the 1968 election\\" can be used non-rigidly. Kripke argues,‚ÄòIdentity and Necessity‚Äô p. 154, there is a similar argument in Naming and Necessity p.104 that if names are rigid designators, then identity must be necessary, because the names ‚Äòa‚Äô and ‚Äòb‚Äô will be rigid designators of an object x if a is identical to b, and so in every possible world, ‚Äòa‚Äô and ‚Äòb‚Äô will both refer to this same object x, and no other, and there could be no situation in which a might not have been b, otherwise x would not have been identical with itself. :Waiving fussy considerations deriving from the fact that x need not have necessary existence, it was clear from (x) nec (x = x) and Leibniz‚Äôs law that identity is an ‚Äòinternal‚Äô relation: (x) (y) (x = y -> nec (x = y)). (What pairs (x, y) could be counterexamples? Not pairs of distinct objects, for then the antecedent is false; nor any pair of an object and itself, for then the consequent is true.) If ‚Äòa‚Äô and ‚Äòb‚Äô are rigid designators, it follows that ‚Äòa = b‚Äô, if true, is a necessary truth. If ‚Äòa‚Äô and ‚Äòb‚Äô are not rigid designators, no such conclusion follows about the statement ‚Äòa = b‚Äô (though the objects designated by ‚Äòa‚Äô and ‚Äòb‚Äô will be necessarily identical).Naming and Necessity p.3 This does not mean that we have knowledge of this necessity. Before the discovery that Hesperus (the evening star) and Phosphorus (the morning star) were the same planet, this fact was not known, and could not have been inferred from first principles. Thus there can be a posteriori necessity. The principle can also be applied to natural kinds. If water is H2O, then water is necessarily H2O. Since the terms 'water' and 'H2O' pick out the same object in every possible world, there is no possible world in which 'water' picks out something different from 'H2O'. Therefore, water is necessarily H2O. It is possible, of course, that we are mistaken about the chemical composition of water, but that does not affect the necessity of identities. What is not being claimed is that water is necessarily H2O, but conditionally, if water is H2O (though we may not know this, it does not change the fact if it is true), then water is necessarily H2O.

Directed by Emmanuel Q. Palo, Erick C. Salud, and Trina N. Dayrit, the series stars Royal Princess of Drama Julia Montes in a dual role, as Kara Dela Rosa and Sara Suarez, together with an ensemble cast consisting of Carmina Villarroel, Mylene Dizon, Ariel Rivera, Allen Dizon, Sam Milby, Maxene Magalona, Alicia Alonzo, Edgar Allan Guzman, and John Lapus. The third season of Doble Kara consists of Kara and Sara's lives and how they will start to get affected because of Lucille's aggravated revenge in seeking justice for Antonio's death. Sara becomes more serious between Edward while Kara and Sebastian will soon experience how to live a married life together. A suspect who is spying on the Suarez's continues to report back to Lucille in order to carryout her plans in destroying the Suarez family. That suspect turns out to be Alexandra and she is an accomplice of Lucille. Plot After the successful operation of Ishmael (Ariel Rivera), Sara (Julia Montes) had finally returned to her house, while Kara (Julia Montes) stayed with her family at the new house she recently bought. Upon learning that both Kara and Sara had retrieved back their inheritance, an envious Alex (Maxene Magalona) desires to meet the same favorable fortune of the twins. Alex and Sebastian (Sam Milby) made a promise to get back the money which their father supposedly left for them. Alex would do everything to retrieve back what is rightfully theirs. Now, Lucille (Carmina Villarroel) is against them as well until several circumstances will change their lives when Alex becomes even more desperate for money and she is determined to strike vengeance against Lucille. Eventually, Lucille turned the tables next to her favors when she started a connivance with Alex and assured to pay her handsomely in exchange for her services. Lucille ordered Alex to lure Sara by convincing her to invest her money to a fraud, while she deals with Kara's unwary temperament in an attempt to pester with her family. Filled with suspicions and doubts towards her mother's sudden closeness, Kara investigates Lucille's true intentions. Kara upon discovering her mother's schemes and Alex's involvement with Lucille, she told an enraged Sara the truth and finally decided to choose her immediate family. Sara is still hopeless to get back the money from Lucille since she already gave it to Alex. Sara catches Alex but she freely escaped from them but then she was kidnapped by a man ordered by Lucille. Sebastian searched for his sister everywhere and even sought help from the policemen but she is nowhere to be found until the court date arrives. The day of confrontation in the court is about to come and Alex is ready to unveil the truth about what really happened to her. Afraid to tell the truth, Alex made a decision not to disclose what really happened to her. In exchange of her silence, Alex was rewarded by Lucille with wealth and money. Lucille wins the case and Alex and Sara's conflict escalates while Lucille didn't stop on ruining the Suarez family and even involve other people to do her commands to watch out for them. However eventually, the Suarezes ignored her, causing the Suarez's happy moments while Kara is trying to fix her relationship with her twin sister. Since Sara lost the money Antonio inherited her, she started her new evil schemes against Kara. And things got twisted when one day, Sara seduces Sebastian and begs for his love causing Kara and Sara's big complication. They search for a way to protect their relationship from Sara. Love still prevails in Kara and Sebastian's favor. One day, when the Suarez planned to enjoy the holidays, they decided to go out for a family vacation and Sebastian prepared for his marriage proposal, but Lucille broke the moment and get the family into a tragic accident. After the incident, the Suarezes had thoughts that Lucille caused the accident but they don't have strong evidence for it. Nevertheless, they arrived uninjured and safe, and Sebastian get everything set for his surprise proposal for Kara. Sara's dissatisfaction and envy arises again and before Kara and Sebastian's wedding, Sara seduces her sister's soon- to-be husband and once more begs for his love, but Sebastian proves that his love is only for Kara. After the scandal, Sebastian distressingly prepares for his upcoming wedding so as Kara and her maid of honor is her own twin sister which might prove that Sara completely reconciles with her twin sister. Sara helped her twin sister with everything for the wedding, but she is doing this to stop the wedding because she and Alex connive with planning to postpone the wedding. However, it was all too late, when Kara and Sebastian finally showed their true love to God. Unfortunately, another deferral bothered as Lucille showed up and annoyingly opposed the wedding causing everyone to walk away and stop the celebration.

Description Penaeus semisulcatus has a pale brown body which sometimes shows a greenish tint on the carapace with two yellow or cream tansvers bands across the back of the carapace. The abdomen is banded with brownish grey and pale yellow transverse bands, while the antennae are banded brown and yellow. It has a uniformly smooth carapace and abdomen. The rostrum has 7 or 8 dorsal teeth and 3 ventral teeth. The atrodrostral crest and groove, the carina, extends beyond the epigastral tooth with the post-rostral carina almost reaching to the rear of the carapace. The maximum total length is 180mm for males and 228mm for females, weighing up to 130g. Distribution Penaeus semisulcatus has an Indo-West Pacific distribution being found from eastern Africa and the Red Sea east to Indonesia and northern Australia. It has also colonised the eastern Mediterranean through the Suez Canal making it a Lessepsian migrant. Habitat and ecology Penaeus semisulcatus occurs from coastal waters down to 130m depth over sandy and muddy substrates. In the Persian Gulf P. semisculatus spawning was at its height during December and in March, but there was a secondary peak in autumn and 90% of the female prawns reached sexual maturity after attaining a carapace length of 54mm. Spawning takes place mainly offshore. The adults are marine but the juveniles prefer estuarine environments. Human exploitation Penaeus semisulcatus is of minor to moderate importance in Madagascar, along the eastern coast of Africa and in the Red Sea. Along the south western Asian coasts from the Gulf of Aden to Pakistan this species is of major importance to the offshore fishery. In India it is not as commercially important as Penaeus monodon. P.semisulcatisis is probably an economically important species in Sri Lanka, Singapore and the Philippines, as well as in Hong Kong, southern Sea of Japan and Korea. In the Mediterranean P. semisulcatus is becoming important to the fisheries in Turkey, Israel and Egypt. In India Penaeus semisulcatus plays a role in the farming of shrimps and prawns in the ricefields of the Ganges delta. Aquaculture experiments with this species are being conducted in Taiwan and Thailand. Prawns caught in Pakistan are exported frozen or canned, as well as being used to make shrimp meal and shrimp paste. Australian import ban In 2017 an outbreak of White spot disease occurred in South East Asia, leading Australia to ban prawn imports.

His marriage to Lettice FitzGerald, heir-general to the 11th Earl of Kildare, led him to spend his life litigating over her claims to the Kildare lands. He divided his time between local business in Warwickshire and in Ireland. Digby was the eldest son of George Digby of Coleshill and his wife Abigail, daughter of Sir Anthony Heveningham. Robert was educated at Magdalen College, Oxford, where he took a BA, and then as a barrister at the Middle Temple, which he entered in 1595. He received his MA from Magdalen in 1598. Around this time, he married Lettice FitzGerald, the daughter of Gerald FitzGerald, Lord Offaly. They had seven sons and three daughters: * Mabel Digby, Lady of Dromana and Decies * Robert Digby, 1st Baron Digby (d. 1642) * Essex Digby (d. 1683), Bishop of Dromore * George Digby * Gerald Digby * John Digby * Simon Digby, MP for Philipstown * Philip Digby, married Margaret Moore * Lettice Digby, married Sir Roger Langford * Abigail Digby, died as a child. Lettice's father had died in 1580, around the time of her birth, and her grandfather the Earl of Kildare had died in 1585, leaving all of his property to his heirs male. She and her husband became increasingly convinced that her grandmother Mabel, the earl's wife, had forged the will in the interest of her sons, Lettice's uncles. After Lettice's last surviving uncle William FitzGerald, 13th Earl of Kildare was lost at sea in April 1599, she assumed the title of \\"Lady Offaly\\" and laid claim to that barony and some of the Kildare estates. Meanwhile, Robert was knighted in Dublin on 4 August 1599 by the Earl of Essex, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland and his wife's first cousin. Digby divided his energies between affairs in Ireland, where his litigation against the 14th Earl of Kildare for Lettice's claims became extremely involved, and in Warwickshire, where he was appointed a justice of the peace for Warwickshire in 1601. His family's long-standing connection with the locally influential Knollys family, reinforced by his marriage to Lettice (whose mother was a Knollys), probably helped secure his return as Member of Parliament for Warwickshire in the same year. He was named an esquire of the body to Queen Elizabeth before her death in 1603. During the reign of James I, Digby assisted Sir Richard Verney, then High Sheriff of Warwickshire, in apprehending some of those involved in the Gunpowder Plot in November 1605. Litigation in Ireland over the Kildare estates continued; King James offered to hear the suit in person in 1610, but Lord Kildare declined on the grounds that he could not afford to plead before the English courts. Kildare died in 1612, and Digby had been appointed to the Privy Council of Ireland by 1613, when he sat as MP for Athy but the issue was still unresolved when he died on 24 May 1618. The expenses of litigation had impaired his estate, and he was forced in his will to ask her to provide settlements for their children from the revenues of her Irish lands and a sum of money held by his brother. A settlement was finally achieved in July 1620: Lettice was created Baroness Offaly for life, with remainder to her grandfather's heirs male, and received the manor of Geashill, with 30,000 acres of land, for herself and her children. Her eldest son Robert was simultaneously created Baron Digby, of Geashill.

In June 1928, Vƒìtra went on tour to the Vienna Opera; in Autumn he concluded a contract with the Opera of Frankfurt am Main, where he worked for two seasons; however, he was obliged to discharge the contract, as he was drafted in the army to serve the missing months. In July 1930, he returned to Riga, joined the military service and served till February 1931 as a sergeant of an artillery regiment. The National Opera concluded a contract for separate performances. At that time Vƒìtra met the ballet-dancer Irene Veil in Germany. They became a couple and he brought her to Rƒ´ga. They had two sons, Pƒìteris and Andrejs. = 1930‚Äì1939 = In August 1930, Vƒìtra became ill and sought a cure at a sanatorium; he had his tonsils removed. After that Vƒìtra returned to the military service. On October 2, while singing Lensky in the opera \\"Eugen Onegin\\", he lost his voice. The management of the Opera had forgotten to recall him in time from the service, and after some heavy load, he had arrived running for the performance. The reviewer Ernests BrusubƒÅrda wrote a destructive critique, declaring that Mariss Vƒìtra is a tenor lacking a sense of duty. On October 25 Vƒìtra publicly slapped him. Because of this, the Director Prande fired Vƒìtra , although many persons defended him. Nonetheless Vƒìtra continued performing. He performed in a number of solo concerts and had material written for him by composers such as JƒÅzeps Vƒ´tols, Jƒìkabs Poruks, JƒÅnis ZƒÅlƒ´tis, L≈´cija Gar≈´ta, JƒÅnis ƒ∂epƒ´tis and Alberts Jƒìrums. At the end of 1930, Vƒìtra sang during the tour at the LiepƒÅja Opera. In January 1931 he gave two farewell concerts before leaving for Germany. There Vƒìtra initially gave performances at the circus under the assumed name of MƒÅrti≈Ü≈° Vells, under which he also recorded albums of light music, then toured Germany, gaining particular success in the opera \\"Mahogany\\" by Kurt Weill. Vƒìtra continued writing for the newspapers \\"Latvis\\", \\"PƒìdƒìjƒÅ Brƒ´dƒ´\\", \\"Latvijas Karavƒ´rs\\", the magazine \\"Daugava\\", also using the pseudonym M. D≈´ka. In the Spring of 1933 he returned to Riga and sang in the performances \\"Poet's Love\\" and \\"Paganini\\" at the Dailes theatre. Vƒìtra had sued the administration of the Opera, and the court sentenced conciliation and ordered that he be paid compensation. Vƒìtra was invited to sing at the Operas and concert halls of various countries. He toured Austria (the Vienna Opera, Graz), the Czech Republic (Prague), Poland, Stockholm (on the celebration of November 18, Latvian Independence Day), and Italy (a concert in Rome). In October 1936, he gave guest performances in Soviet Russia, again in 1937. Vƒìtra had gained notice with the recordings of popular songs for the albums of \\"Bellaccord Electro\\". In 1934, Vƒìtra took part in the German movie \\"Spring Fairy\\" (Fr√ºhlingsm√§rchen) (directed by Carl Froelich), in which he played an Italian fisherman ‚Äì a recently discovered natural tenor. The opening performance took place at the cinema \\"Forum\\". Also in 1934, Vƒìtra directed the performance of the operetta \\"Mountain song\\" (orig. Fr√ºhling, later Das F√ºrstenkind) at the National Theatre, opening on May 15. Starting from 1935, Vƒìtra had many roles at the National Opera as a free-lancer ‚Äì Goesta Berling in the opera \\"The Cavaliers of Ekeby\\" (I cavalieri di Ekeb√π) by Riccardo Zandonai, Grishka in the opera \\"The Legend of the Invisible City of Kitezh\\" by Rimski-Korsakow. In 1935, he published a book, \\"Div‚Äôd≈´ji≈Üas\\" (\\"Two Doves\\") about the experience of the Liberty fights. = 1940‚Äì1946 = In 1940, during the Soviet occupation of Lavia, Vƒìtra directed several one-act plays at the National Theatre, and also sung the part of Grigory Melekhov in the opera \\"Tihij Don\\". He also gave chamber music concerts, including songs with subtexts understandable by the audiences. During the German occupation, Vƒìtra continued singing at the Riga Opera, gave concerts at the Aula-hall of the university. On March 15, 1944, Vƒìtra took part in the first performance of the cantata \\"Dievs, Tava zeme deg!\\" (\\"God, Your Earth is Burning!\\") by L≈´cija Gar≈´ta at the Church of St. Gertrude. On October 8, 1944, Vƒìtra's family fled to Sweden by refugee boat. They arrived first in Gotland, and later went to Stockholm. To earn a living, Vƒìtra took odd jobs, including hard physical labour. As Vƒìtra had worked at the Opera, the Refugee Aid Bureau sent him to the Royal Opera, where he had to work in a dark cellar, writing in the sheet music books the text of operas in Swedish. Vƒìtra became an active author for the recently formed press edition \\"Latvju Zi≈Üas\\". = Life and work in Canada = In 1946, Vƒìtra was offered work at the Canadian Opera, so he gave a farewell concert, which was reviewed by Oƒºƒ£erts Bi≈°tƒìvi≈Ü≈°; the review has survived. In January 1947, Vƒìtra and family moved to Canada, where the situation in the meantime had changed, and he was refused the job; therefore Vƒìtra went to Halifax and started working at the Conservatoire of Halifax, where he founded an opera course. In Halifax, Vƒìtra did substantial organizing work, looking for employers, so as to make it easier for the Latvian refugees to survive in Canada until they could to return to Latvia. Initially Vƒìtra himself met each ship bringing refugees and tried to help them. The group of local Latvians formed the Latvian Relief Association in order to aid Vƒìtra and Teodors Brilts (former baritone of the Latvian National Opera) also financially; Vƒìtra was the first Head of the Association. In 1950, jointly with Canadian Latvian National Association of Toronto (headed by K. Dobelis), it founded the united Latvian National Association in Canada. While working in Halifax, where there were neither an Opera house, nor an orchestra, Vƒìtra together with his students gave concerts of opera excerpts, and in 1949, inviting also other musically gifted people, staged the opera \\"Don Giovanni\\", which was the first opera production in the city. The inhabitants of Halifax appreciated the quality of the performances, and it helped Vƒìtra to promote the formation of the Nova Scotia Opera Association, in which he together with the conductor and pianist Alfrƒìds Strombergs performed the functions of the art director and stage director. The Opera Association started to support opera productions financially. Vƒìtra also stimulated the formation of the symphonic orchestra of the Conservatoire of Halifax. He produced productions of \\"Stories of Hoffmann\\" by Offenbach, \\"La Traviata\\" by Verdi (both in 1950), \\"Madame Butterfly\\" by Puccini and \\"Le Nozze di Figaro\\" by Mozart (both in 1951), as well as the operetta \\"Graefin Mariza\\" by I. Kalman (1952). In 1953, Vƒìtra and his family moved to Toronto, where he formed the Vocal Studio. One of the most outstanding pupils was Marta Macvicar, who despite being of Irish descent, also sang in Latvian. The Studio gave concerts and even toured the United States. In 1954, the publishing house \\"GrƒÅmatu Draugs\\" in New York published the memoirs by Vƒìtra \\"Mans Baltais nams\\" (\\"My White House\\") and \\"Karaƒºa viesi\\" (\\"The King's Guests\\"). His books \\"Rƒ´ga toreiz...\\" (\\"Riga at that time...\\", 1955) and \\"SestƒÅ kolonna\\" (\\"The Sixth Column\\", 1957) were also published there. Vƒìtra wrote many publications for newspapers as well: \\"Latvju Zi≈Üas\\" (in Sweden), \\"Laiks\\" (in the USA), \\"Latvija AmerikƒÅ\\" (in Canada) and \\"Latvija\\" (in Germany). In all the books and articles there is a rich heritage material. During the USSR years, people were arrested for reading and having at home the books by Vƒìtra. Vƒìtra's writing became legal in Latvia only in 1990. Vƒìtra was an active participant in the culture and social life of Canadian Latvians even until 1962, when he had a stroke and could not sing any more. He died on December 24, 1965, in Toronto, and was buried in the local Latvian cemetery in the territory of the North York cemetery.

Directed by Emmanuel Q. Palo and Trina N. Dayrit, the series stars Royal Princess of Drama Julia Montes in a dual role, as Kara Acosta and Sara Suarez, together with an ensemble cast consisting of Carmina Villarroel, Mylene Dizon, Ariel Rivera, Allen Dizon, Sam Milby, Alicia Alonzo, Edgar Allan Guzman, and John Lapus. This season marks the beginning of the second book of the series. The fourth season of Doble Kara is about Kara and Sara, and how they will both start to experience motherhood as they are pregnant. Sara goes to Japan to search for Edward but failed and decided to do everything for her daughter instead. Both babies are born and Kara's daughter's name is Isabella and Sara's is Rebecca. Twists change then when Rebecca tragically died because of premature labor. A suspect will give Sara, Kara's daughter and she will raise her as her own. Things become even worse for them both as Sara returns to the Suarez family and Alex continues her agenda to ruin them. Plot  Later on, Lucille (Carmina Villarroel) was again charged with temporary restraining order but as a wedding gift, the new couple is given many presents including Lucille's which is thought to be a bomb and Barbara (Alicia Alonzo) knows this, so she protected her daughter by imprisoning her again. A deranged Lucille who keeps on seeing Antonio (Allen Dizon) as an apparition continues with her agenda in ruining the Suarez and taking Kara (Julia Montes) back to her arms. Barbara, upon noticing her daughter's unstable state, persistently protects her. Sara (Julia Montes) is alone after being left by Edward (Edgar Allan Guzman) and the twins, after making up with their boyfriends, are revealed to be carrying babies. Lucille, desperate to retrieve back her only daughter and sole memory of Antonio, committed a crime of arson and set the house of the Suarez on fire. She was later pleaded guilty for the crimes she deliberately committed including the accident experienced by the Suarez during their holiday vacation. Instead of imprisoning her, Lucille was instituted by the court in a mental hospital as she was suffering from a late-onset schizophrenia. Hoping to find Edward, the father of her unborn child, Sara went to Japan, but failed miserably just as Chloe (Patricia Javier), believing that Sara would only bring her son misery and pain, led Sara astray and forced Edward to migrate in South Korea. Sara, with the help of a friend, decided to work and start her life anew in Japan for her baby instead. Both babies are born, christened as Rebecca and Isabella. However, Sara mourned and grieved as Rebecca shortly died after her birth and just like Lucille's daughter, it is caused by a premature birth brought about by a weak immune system. After the misfortunes Sara had experienced in Japan, she went home to the Philippines, but chose not to return to her family, thinking that she'll only be a hindrance and be judged by her family because of her wrong decisions in life again. While Sara is sorrowfully saddened and hasn't moved on, Kara and Sebastian (Sam Milby) promised to Isabella to protect and support her and be good parents. With all these happenings, Lucille, Alex (Maxene Magalona) and Sara started to suffer their consequences for their evil schemes and actions by having Lucille confined in a mental hospital, Alex being imprisoned and Sara losing her child. Not long after Isabella's few months, she was unfortunately separated from Kara and Sebastian which causes a family problem to the Suarez. Nobody knows who intended to kidnap the child and not stopping to search for her. Isabella was left in front of Sara's house under unknown circumstances and she took maternal care for her. Nowhere else to go, Sara was taken in by Cynthia (Mickey Ferriols) in her Club Felicidad where Sara and Isabella spend over the following years. Six years later, Isabella who's now Rebecca (Krystal Mejes) grew up with gratitude and kindness much like her true parents and Sara will also learn to live with Rebecca without knowing her identity. Kara will also meet Hannah (Myel De Leon) by accident and later developed some form of bonding with Hannah and adopted her as her daughter while Lucille stays in a mental hospital hoping for an acceptance from Kara and be together again. Rebecca will meet Banjo (Rayver Cruz) whom she misleads as her father because of Sara. But they will form a friendship and will treat each other a family. Meanwhile, Alex is slowly brainwashing Kara and Seb‚Äôs adoptive daughter, Hannah, and instills in her that she is not well-loved, building hatred in the child‚Äôs heart, thus causing her to be evil and vengeful. And their situation gets even more complicated now that Sara has finally returned to her family. Once Sara returns to the Suarez family, Alex starts to put her plan into motion. Alex brainwashes Hannah to do everything that she orders her to and Hannah starts to be as if she was Alex's puppet. Meanwhile, there are problems in the Dela Rosa Foundation, now managed by Kara, due to Lucille's absence and unstable state. Ishmael (Ariel Rivera) starts to suspect and become suspicious of Alex's actions, only annoying Alex greatly. One night when the whole family went to the Club Felicidad to watch Sara's performance, Ishmael followed Alex when she went to her accomplice, Dina (Cristine Yao), to give the money that she was demanding. He overheard Alex and Dina talking, and threatened to call the police after discovering their involvement in Isabella's abduction. This caused Alex and Dina to panic, and Ishmael got hit in the head by Dina. Alex, waking up to her senses, attempted to save Ishmael's life by bringing him to the nearest hospital. But she was threatened and stopped by Dina, causing Ishmael to die in the hospital later that night. The family becomes depressed after Ishmael's sudden death, even Alex, and especially Laura (Mylene Dizon). One night she has a dream of Ishmael in the hospital, she said that he was saying Kara's daughter's name, Isabella, over and over. Meanwhile, Alex realized that she shouldn't care about Kara's family that much and decides to resume her evil schemes of plotting her revenge and becomes part of a syndicate with the help of Dina. She asks her boss for help because Kara starts to become suspicious and starts to search who killed her father and who kidnapped her daughter. Alex's boss hired someone to pretend to be Ishmael's killer, but the one he hired got killed because Alex started to panic because she thought he would admit that he was only hired and that Alex and her connivant were the one who accidentally killed Ishmael. It is unknown to Kara's family and to her that Rebecca is really her long-lost daughter with Sebastian, Isabella Acosta. However, Sara is falsely accused of being a drug pusher and was imprisoned causing Club Felicidad to be closed. Unknown to all of them, this was planned by Sara's evil suitor, Mr. Delgado (Noel Colet). This urged Sara to leave Becca under the care of her family. Kara volunteers to be Rebecca's mother for the meantime while Rebecca decides to pretend as Isabella to make Kara happy. Unknown to them, they are already having a real mother-daughter bonding. Edward returns to make up for all his wrongdoings to Sara and his child, Rebecca. He asked Sara for one more chance to fix their relationship and he tries his best to be a father figure to Rebecca, much to the continuous disapproval of Sara. He never knew that their real child died as an infant back when Sara was in Japan and that Becca was just adopted. Despite Sara's disapproval, Edward never lost hope and continued to apologize to Sara day by day. One day Edward followed Kara and Rebecca to a bookstore, only to find out that Rebecca is accused of stealing a box of crayons because of Hannah's schemes. Edward did his best to save Becca by urging the shop to view the footage to prove Becca was innocent and that Hannah was the real cause of the incident. This was the start of a fatherly relationship between Edward and Becca. But Sara still disapproves of Edward coming back to their lives, causing him to lose hope. Now, Alex decides to use Edward by secretly offering of bringing Becca to see him daily. Edward was hesitant in the beginning because he didn't want to further damage his relationship with Sara, but he eventually accepted the offer and started a connivance with Alex and was hopeless that Sara will never let him bond with his daughter. Edward doesn't realize that he is being used as bait in Alex's plan to destroy Kara and Sara's relationship even further. Sara accepts Edward to be with Becca.

It is a shrub with linear to lance-shaped leaves with a single vein, and spherical groups of between four and ten pink flowers on the ends of shoots.habit on East Mount Barren Description Kunzea similis is an erect shrub that typically grows to a height of and has several main stems with few branches. Young branches are densely covered with silky hairs. The leaves are linear to lance-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, long and long on a petiole about long. It differs from K. capitata in having leaves with a single vein. The flowers are arranged in more or less spherical groups of between four and ten flowers on the ends of the shoots. There are lance-shaped to egg-shaped bracts and pairs of bracteoles at the base of the flowers. The sepals are triangular, long and densely covered with silky hairs. The petals are pink, spatula-shaped to egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base and long. There are between 32 and 44 stamens that are long. Flowering occurs from September to November and the fruit is an urn-shaped capsule. Taxonomy and naming Kunzea similis was first formally described in 1996 by Hellmut R. Toelken and the description was published in Journal of the Adelaide Botanic Garden. The specific epithet (similis) is a Latin word meaning \\"like\\". Two subspecies were described in 2007 by Toelken and Gillian Craig and are accepted by the Australian Plant Census: * Kunzea similis subsp. mediterranea Toelken & G.F.Craig, a shrub that grows to a height of and has bracteoles that are longer than those of the autonym; * Kunzea similis Toelken subsp. similis, a smaller shrub with bracteoles that are hidden between the flowers. Distribution and habitat Subspecies similis occurs in the Fitzgerald River National Park near Hopetoun, where it grows in sparse, low heath. Subspecies mediterranea is found in a small area to the east of Ravensthorpe growing on a ridge top in open mallee and dense heath. Conservation status Both subspecies of K. similis are classified as \\"Threatened Flora (Declared Rare Flora ‚Äî Extant)\\" by the Department of Environment and Conservation (Western Australia). Subspecies similis is listed as \\"critically endangered\\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. The main threat to the subspecies is the fungal disease caused by Phytophthora cinnamomi.

He then gets Rebecca's DNA sample from Chloe, who previously conducted her own test. Sebastian then tells Kara about his suspicions about Rebecca and Sara, however, Kara refuses to believe that Sara is involved in Isabella's kidnapping. Sara then meets Banjo, agreeing to flee the Philippines, on the condition that he brings Rebecca with them abroad. On the day of Banjo and Sara's plan to flee, Sebastian finally gets the results of the DNA test, which confirms that Rebecca and Isabella are the same day. Kara and Sebastian, desperate to retrieve their daughter, are on the hunt for Sara and Isabella (Rebecca). Sara and Rebecca then go the Suarez household and bid their farewells to Laura and Itoy but, in a consequence of her action, Kara arrives and confronts Sara, telling her to return Rebecca to her. Full of anger, Kara and Sebastian have Sara arrested, much against Laura's will. Sara attempts to explain but Kara, who is full anger, but she refuses to listen and has Sara imprisoned. Sara is then bailed of jail, returns to the Suarez household, under the condition that she will help Kara get closer to Rebecca. Meanwhile, Alex, unsatisfied with the happenings, decides to frame-up Sara for Isabella's kidnapping, and plants the kidnapper's phone in her luggage. Attorney Reyes (Jerry O'Hara), the Acosta family attorney, conducts a fingerprint on the cellphone, however, no signs of Sara's fingerprints are on the cellphone. Attempting to get closer to her daughter, Kara has a family outing, but Rebecca refuses to go unless Sara goes.

Kara and Sara then reveal the truth to Rebecca. Distraught and heartbroken, Isabella goes into hiding, but is later found. Kara and Sara's complications escalate, with Kara blaming her sister of Rebecca's misery. On the other hand, Edward is revealed to have sent the lawyer to help Sara, as he is not convinced that Sara kidnapped Isabella. Later, Barbara (Alicia Alonzo) returns from abroad, and finds out that Isabella has been found. Sara, wanting to mend her relationship with Kara and Sebastian, decides to leave the Suarez household in order to give Rebecca a chance to acknowledge Sebastian and Kara as her parents. As Sara departs, Rebecca attempts to make her stop, but Sara still leaves, however, reassures Rebecca that they will be together again. With Sara gone, Kara tries to win Rebecca's affections, but is constantly rejected. Meanwhile, Hannah, angry about what is happening, confronts Rebecca and tells her to leave. Julio, on the other hand, is still furious about Patricia's relationship with Paolo. Kara's anger at Sara enlarges once she intercepts on a secret conversation that she had with Rebecca. Desperate to have a relationship with her daughter, Kara kneels and begs that Rebecca accepts her as her mother. However, Rebecca still only loves Sara as her mother, and also rebuffs Kara's attempts. Later on, Barbara then meets with her lawyer, who gives her Lucille's (Carmina Villarroel) items from her previous mental facility. Inside the box is pictures of Kara, Lucille, and Antonio (Allen Dizon), and Isabella's baby pin. Attempting to clear Lucille's name, Barbara decides to team-up with Laura and Sara in order to find out who is the real culprit behind Isabella's abduction. Sara, desperate to know the truth, blames Lucille as the culprit, but Barbara insists that her daughter is not mentally sane. Kara, on the other hand, is also now beginning to suspect Sara as Isabella's kidnapper. Laura attempts to get Kara to drop the charges against Sara but Kara is desperate to receive justice. Laura and Itoy then decide to conduct their own investigation by following Alex to the mall. The two see Alex exchanging items with a man whom the deem as suspicious. Because of this, Itoy and Laura decide to confront Alex, but is met with excuses. Itoy then tells Sebastian about his findings. As a consequence of this, Sebastian, too, starts to become suspicious of Alex. Full of anger, Alex leaves the Suarez household. Barbara then meets up with Laura, revealing to her that Lucille's former nurse is returning from abroad. Alex then uses Hannah as spy to know all of the movements of Suarez family. Hannah then tells Alex that Laura and Barbara were talking about Lucille's nurse. Alex then concocts a plan to further implicate Sara in Rebecca's disappearance. Julio then orders his men to kidnap Flor Bautista (uncredited), Lucille's nurse, and to bribe her to tell Barbara that Sara ordered her to give the baby pin to Lucille. With Alex's plan in motion, Flor tells Barbara that Sara was the one who ordered her to give Isabella's pin to Lucille. Barbara reveals to Kara and Laura about her finding, however, they refuse to believe her. Kara and Laura then decide to meet up with Flor, who they later convince to testify in the trial against Sara. With her conscience getting the best of her, Flor decides to retract her agreement with Alex. Desperate to incriminate Sara, Alex orders her men to kidnap and hold Flor's children captive. The day of the court day arrives, Flor decides not to disclose the truth. Flor then tells the court that Sara was the one who ordered her to give the pin to Lucille. The court then brings out Dante Nicholas (uncredited), Dina's (Cristine Yao) brother, who was hired along with Flor. Dante then discloses to the court that Sara was the mastermind behind Isabella's kidnapping. Shortly after the hearing, Alex and Sara have a heated confrontation in the restroom. Sara then vows to clear her name and to make Isabella's real kidnapper pay. Sara's sentencing day soon arrives. But because of the testimonies and evidences, Sara is found guilty is Isabella's kidnapping and is sentenced to reclusion perpetua (life imprisonment). Because they believe that Sara is innocent, Barbara orders her henchman, Diego (uncredited), to investigate Julio and Alex and tell her and Laura the findings. With the initial investigation of Barbara and Laura, all of the evidences point to Alex, whom they believe is the culprit. Meanwhile, Sara, who now resides in prison, becomes her fellow inmates protector and defender from the powerful Rona \\"Mayora\\" (Maria Isabel Lopez). Desperate to talk to Rebecca, Sara decides to swallow her pride and become Mayora's servant in order to use a cellphone that was illegally smuggled in the prison. While in the prison, Sara befriends Kengkay (Kristel Fulgar), Nancy (Sunshine Garcia), and Lola Caring (Odette Khan). Later, Sara soon befriends Mayora, after learning that she, too, has a child that she wants to make amends with. Sara, along with Kengkay, Lola Caring, Nancy, and Mayora, plan to escape the prison. Sara puts their plan into motion by starting a fire, Rona pretends to be injured in order to distract a guard so that Kengkay could steal the key, and Nancy tampers with the circuit breaker in order for power to be shut down throughout the prison. Sara, along with her friends, escape with the help of Banjo, who brings them to a hideout location in the woods. Sara then decides to proceed with her agenda in proving Alex guilty, follows her, and subsequently gets into a major brawl with Alex. Sara then flees; Alex later calls Sebastian, further attempting to incriminate Sara. Because of this, Kara begins to worry about their safety, fearing that Sara might target her family next. Sara then tries to investigate a man named Mr. Gomez (uncredited), who happens to be a customer of Julio's illegal business. Sara also finds out that Mr. Gomez knows Alex and Dina's connection with one another. Sara and Banjo then decide to follow Mr. Gomez but, unfortunately, cannot follow him. Sara then believes she has enough evidence to implicate Alex, and calls Kara and arranges to meet with her. Sebastian and Kara then start to wonder if Sara is innocent. Unbeknownst to them, Hannah overheard the conversation, and later reported this to Alex. Later, Patricia then discovers Julio's gun that she used to kill Barbara's investigator, Diego. Sara and the fellow inmates then get captured, however, Sara's accomplices distract the police long enough for Sara to escape. SPO1 Arellano (Simon Ibarra), the head of Isabella's kidnapping case, then has a confrontation with Sara which ends in him shooting Sara. Injured and fighting for her life, Sara then calls Edward to rescue her and also to treat her gunshot wound. Rebecca then finds out on what happened to Sara after overhearing Kara's conversation with SPO1 Arellano. Kara then starts to worry that Rebecca will sent her again as a result. Alex and Julio then start to worry that Sara might not actually be dead, and that she is getting ready to get her vengeance against them. Meanwhile, Barbara continues her investigation with Laura in helping prove Sara and Lucille's innocence. She then pays a visit to Flor Bautista's parents, whom ironically, own a supermarket by using the money that Alex paid Flor to tell the court that Sara ordered her to give Isabella's baby pin to Lucille. Flor's parents then inform Barbara that their daughter has left the country. The couple then stiffen and tell Barbara to leave, asking her to let them have a peace of mind and not to involve them, or Flor, in any of Lucille's nor the Suarez family's affairs. Later on, Sebastian returns to the Suarez household, bringing Hannah and Rebecca's passport, preparing from their departure abroad. Rebecca, who is melancholy about joining them, reluctantly agrees to go with them in order to please Kara and Sebastian. However, Rebecca refuses to leave for abroad without saying her farewells to Sara. Banjo then sneaks Sara into the Suarez household. Unfortunately, Hannah saw the two. Meanwhile, Alex and Julio attempt to further incriminate Sara by kidnapping Rebecca and bringing her to a remote destination. The Acosta family's departure is soon delayed; the family attempts to find the Rebecca. On other hand, SPO1 Arellano and his team continue to investigate Alex, and also her involvement with Mr. Gomez and also Dina. Hannah later informs Kara that she saw Sara talking to Rebecca. Alex later uses a different SIM-Card to text Sara to go to the warehouse where Rebecca is held captive. Then, Julio pretends to be a resident of the town and tips off the police that he has seen Sara nearby. Later, Kara then enters the warehouse where Rebecca is held captive and sees Sara with Isabella (Rebecca). Kara continuously accuses Sara for Isabella's kidnapping which causes the sisters to get into an argument. A gas lamp later falls causing a fire inside the warehouse. In a last-minute decision, Rebecca decides to go and escape with Sara, her foster mother (aunt), rather than go with her biological mother, Kara. Kara then starts to question whether if she's a good mother. Barbara then meets with Mr. Gomez, while using an alias, Valeria del Mundo. Barbara then befriends Mr. Gomez, who later tells her to borrow from a loan shark. He later tells her that Julio is the head of the syndicate. Barbara then infiltrates the business and, consequently, reports this police, causing his assets to get seized and money to be frozen. Julio then finds out; he plans to bring Alex and Patricia abroad. Meanwhile, Patricia decides to meet with Paolo, however, Julio follows her. He then goes into a rage, causing him to bring out his gun threatening to shoot Paolo. Kara then becomes more suspicious of Alex and she and Itoy follow her. However, Alex sees her and orders her driver to run over Kara. Itoy then shields her, pushes her out of the way, which causes him to get a sprained ankle from the impact. Sebastian, who is desperate to get to the bottom of who kidnapped Isabella, makes Alex believe that he is on her side, rather than Kara's. Alex then believes Sebastian's tactics and decides to reconcile with him. Complications further arise in Alex and Julio's lives when Dina, Alex's accomplice in kidnapping Isabella, is revealed to be alive. Alex and Julio then become aware of this; they then order their henchmen to kill Dina. However, Sara arrives and rescues Dina and her mother. Sara then begs for Dina to help her clean her name. Fortunately, Dina feels guilty about her actions and decides to confess her crimes to police. Dina then goes the police station, admits her crimes, and also points out that Sara is innocent. She then reveals to the authorities that Alex is the mastermind of Isabella's kidnapping. The cops, along with Sebastian and Kara, go to Julio's residence attempting to arrest Alex. However, Alex and Julio, along with Patricia, have already made an escape. Sebastian then calls Alex and overhears in Julio talking about their destination point in the background. Alex, Julio, and Patricia then begin to board the helicopter to leave country, however, Kara and Sebastian then arrive, ready to have Alex apprehended. Moments before her arrest, Alex is then rushed to hospital after experiencing some major stomach pain. Alex is then brought the hospital, revealed to be pregnant. SPO1 Arellano then starts to interview Alex in her hospital bed, but she constantly denies all accusations thrown at her. Kara then confronts Alex, telling her how much pain she went through when Isabella was kidnapped from her and Sebastian. Kara then tells Alex that she treated her like family, despite her previous connivance with Lucille in destroying her family. The two then get into a heated confrontation, which is then stopped by Sebastian. Sebastian tells Alex that he will make her pay for her crimes and that he did things for her that she did not even deserve. Later, Sebastian explains to Kara that Alex never felt loved by their mother, Lorena (Maila Gumila), and how she was never satisfied with anything. He then adds that Alex's only ally was their father, Delfin (unseen). Julio later tells Alex that he has ordered his men to stop Dina. In the meantime, the Suarez family are rejoicing since Sara will be proven innocent and Rebecca will soon return. That night, Kara and Sebastian then fully reconcile, promising to uphold the promise of punishing Alex, doing whatever it takes. The Suarez family attorney then issues a warrant of arrest for Alex, who later gets incarcerated. The cops arrest Alex and she is greeted by SPO1 Arellano, Laura, and Barbara. Laura then confronts Alex swearing to make her pay for her crimes. Julio then bails Alex out of jail but she vows to not rest until she ruins the Suarez family. Sara then surrenders to the police, but is then put back to jail. Kara then kneels and begs that her sister forgive her. The twins then reconcile. Meanwhile, Dina is currently under the protection of the Witness Protection Program. Kara, Sebastian, and Rebecca then return home the Suarez household, where they are greeted by a delighted family. Hannah and Rebecca then make peace and decide to treat each like real sisters. Kara and Sebastian then spend the night of Rebecca's room, where they are later joined by Hannah. The Acosta family then spend a happy night sleeping together. Alex and Julio then plan to escape all of their crimes by fleeing the country. Alex then attempts to get her birth certificate, however, there is a clerical error because on her original birth certificate her mother is listed as Benilda (unseen). However, on the birth certificate she is currently using, her mother's name is listen as Lorena. Alex then confronts Sebastian who then reveals to her that she is not Lorena and Delfin's daughter, but in fact, their father's daughter from another woman. Betrayed, Alex rebuffs all of Sebastian's attempts in reconciling, and feels heartbroken because they are not full siblings. Furious about this, Alex decides to not have mercy on the Suarez family, and decides to pursue her revenge on them. Dina, who finally is ready to testify, recaps all the events from the planning of Isabella's kidnapping to the day that it was executed. Dina then reveals to SPO1 Arellano that Alex ordered to kidnap Isabella, then planted Isabella on Sara's footstep, and then finally ordered Flor Bautista to give the child's baby pin to Lucille. Kara and Rebecca then pray that Sara will be together with them for Christmas. While the whole family is decorating the house of Christmas, Sara then appears, greeting Rebecca and fulfilling her daughter's wish for them to be together for the holiday. The Suarez family then decide to enjoy themselves for one day, and forget about their problems. Meanwhile, in the Hernandez household, Julio promises Alex that he will provide everyone for her and for his future child. Finally, the day of the court day arrives, Dina is ready to disclose the truth about the circumstances on Isabella's kidnapping. However, Dina's credibility as a witness ruined after Julio reveals to the court that Dina is making up lies in order to ruin his and Alex's relationship because he chose to love Alex rather than her. After the hearing, Dina and Alex have a heated confrontation. Alex then taunts Dina saying that she, along with the Suarez family, are no match to her and Julio. However, Dina then tells Alex that she has one big ace above her. Dina then threatens to reveal to authorities and the Suarez family that it was Alex who murdered Ishmael Suarez (Ariel Rivera), the Padre-de-Familia of the Suarez family. However, Alex then shows her arrogance by telling her that it was Dina that murdered Ishmael. Later, Sara plans to get Julio's gun in order to prove that it was Julio who killed Barbara's henchman, Diego. Edward then distracts the maid of the Hernandez family so that Sara could sneak into the house. Sara then sneaks in the house and turns the home upside down looking for the gun. However, Patricia then catches her in the act. Sara then attempts to convince Patricia to look for Julio's gun and turn it into the authorities. Because of Sara, Patricia then confronts Julio, forcing him to admit the truth to her. But, Julio denies all of her questions, and tells her that the Suarez family is making her turn against him. Later on, Patricia finds Julio's gun and brings it to SPO1 Arellano. Because of this, Julio and Alex plan to leave the country, once again. The next day, Julio and Alex put their escape plan into motion and also bring Patricia. Meanwhile, SPO1 Arellano finds Diego's camera. After looking through various photos in the camera, SPO1 Arellano executes his plan in having Julio and Alex apprehended. The Suarez family then finds out and the plan to help in Alex and Julio's arrests. Patricia, knowing what is right, stands by her ground and refuses to go with Julio and Alex. She then chokes the driver, causing him to pull over. Patricia then escapes the vehicle and goes to Kara and Sara. Not wanting to get apprehended, Alex attempts to flee, however, Kara, Sara, and Patricia catch her. Julio, also fleeing the scene, gets into a gun battle exchange with SPO1 Arellano, causing him to get shot and, subsequently, falls into the river from the bridge above. After her fight with Sara, Kara, and Patricia, Alex's stomach starts to hurt, causing the trio to rush her to the hospital. However, this turns into an escape opportunity for Alex and she tricks the nurse aiding her. Julio, who is in critical condition, calls Alex for help. Alex then finds Julio and brings him into a lying-in clinic, and threatens the doctor to treat him. However, when the doctor attempts to call the authorities, Julio retrieves his gun and kills the doctor. The cops are then informed by the tragedy in the lying-in clinic, SPO1 Arellano, along with Sebastian and Kara, arrive and investigate the crime. Arellano then finds a bullet and has it lab tested. If the bullet matches a bullet from the headquarters, it is confirmed that Julio and Alex were in the lying-in clinic. After the fiasco with the doctor, Alex and Julio then go into hiding. Julio, who is in critical condition, desires to go the hospital and seek medical treatment, however, does not go, fearing that the cops will arrest Alex. Later, Julio then calls his sister, Patricia, and tells her to visit him due to his current condition. Patricia then arrives, begging Julio to seek medical attention, much to the detriment of Alex. Alex, who still blames Patricia, constantly insults her. Patricia later leaves and tells Sebastian, Paolo, and later the authorities of Julio's whereabouts in order for him to get the proper medical treatment. Later on, Julio reminds Alex about their wedding and, despite their current situation, marries Alex through secret circumstances. However, shortly after the wedding, the police arrive and arrest Julio for murdering Barbara's private investigator, Diego, and the doctor and the lying-in clinic. The cops then also arrest Alex for harboring a criminal (Julio). While in the possession of the authorities, Arellano questions Alex, but she constantly denies all accusations. The Hernandez family's lawyer then bail Alex out of jail. Kara, Sebastian, and Sara then confront Alex, who then starts insulting the pair and telling them to give fighting her and Julio. Kara then swears to Alex that they will get justice for all of the crimes that she did. While on his deathbed, Julio promises Alex that he will protect her. In order to let Alex be acquitted for Isabella's kidnapping, Julio takes blame for her kidnapping. As a consequence, Alex is no longer a suspect. Meanwhile, after taking the blame, Julio then discloses to Alex that after he takes the blame for the kidnapping, he and Alex will flee the country for good. The Acosta-Suarez family, and also Barbara, promise to make Alex pay for her crimes she committed, especially for the kidnapping of Isabella, and also for Alex's implication against Sara and Lucille. Nearing the end of the year, the Suarez family are celebrating New Year's Eve and also the new year, but lighting fireworks, singing, and spending time with family and friends including Sara's Club Felicidad family and Barbara. Like their Christmas party, the Suarez family decide to forget their problems for a day, too. Shortly after the new year, Julio executes his plan in escaping the hospital. Unbeknownst to Julio and Alex, his wound is getting worse. During their escape, Julio loses consciousness and, after several attempts to revive him, dies. Alex is filled with grief and anger and vows to avenge Julio's death making her biggest and most ferocious revenge against the Suarez family, especially Sara and Kara. After Julio's death, Alex becomes Patricia's legal guardian, becomes the matriarch of the Hernandez household, and takes over all of Julio's legal, and also illegal, businesses. Sara then attempts to convince Patricia to get evidences to implicate Alex as she is the closest to Alex. Patricia then looks through an old CCTV camera that Julio had installed and saw the footage of Alex admitting that she was the mastermind of Isabella's kidnapping. Patricia then calls Kara informing her about the evidence. Unfortunately, however, Alex found out about her plan and destroys the evidences. Kara, Sara, Sebastian, and Paolo then arrive in Alex's house demanding to speak to Patricia. Fearing for her life, Patricia decides to not disclose the truth. While hugging Paolo, Patricia slips a secret note into his pocket, begging for the Suarez family to rescue her from Alex's hands. Determined to get justice for Julio, Patricia, Paolo, Sara, and her nanny, Yaya Cass (uncredited), help her escape. She then brings a copy of the CCTV footage in a flash-drive where Alex admits she is the mastermind of Isabella's kidnapping. SPO1 Arellano then plans to have Alex arrested. Alex then enters the Suarez household demanding them to show Patricia. Arellano then contacts Kara, telling them to let Alex stay in their house until they arrest her. However, Alex got annoyed in their presence and left. Minutes after her departure, SPO1 Arellano arrives with Patricia, Paolo, Sara, and Edward. A car chase occurs between Kara, Sebastian, and Alex. Arellano then attempts to get Alex to surrender but, however, she refuses. Sara then tries to catch Alex, herself, which causes her henchman, Gabo (Joseph Ison), to shoot her. However, Edward interferes and takes gunshot for her. Alex then escapes while Edward gets rushed to the hospital for emergency surgery. Edward gets admitted to hospital. Sara attempts to visit him, however, Edward's mother, Chloe, forbids Sara to enter and blames her for what happened to her son. Desperate to save her son, Chloe begs that Sara stay away from Edward. Because of her love for Edward, Sara agrees and tells him that she does not love him anymore and that he should return to Japan. Heartbroken, Edward leaves Sara and returns to Japan, along with Chloe, to continue his recovery. Angry and hungry for revenge, Alex flees the Philippines and goes abroad to Malaysia, waiting for herself to give birth, so that she could return and get her biggest revenge against the Suarez family. Upon learning this, the Suarez family still live in fear fearing that Alex will return. Alex, on the other hand, promises that the fight between her and the Suarez family is not over, and that she will be back. In the meantime, the Suarez family enjoys peace and tranquility without Alex. Later, Barbara visits Itoy and Laura, telling them that she treats them like family and that they are her closest friends, now that Lucille is the mental facility. Sara then goes to Club Felicidad and makes her feelings for Banjo clearing, telling him that she only sees him as a friend. Hurt by her brother's suffering, Cynthia (Mickey Ferriols) requests that Sara resigns from the club in order not to prolong Banjo's hurt feelings. Sara then agrees to this.

She visited many agencies and institutions of higher education throughout the United States and abroad meeting with noted experts in order to explore this topic from a variety of perspectives. Edwards also volunteered as a parent consultant at a local Head Start center in a small rural northern Louisiana community to investigate how to support parents' efforts to foster their children's educational development.Edwards, P.A. & Panofsky, C.P. (1989). The effect of two training procedures on the book reading of lower-SES mothers and children. National Reading Conference Yearbook, 138, 135-143. Edwards continued this research in her next job at Louisiana State University. During this time, she developed many of the ideas that would become her program Parents as Partners in Reading: A Family Literacy Training Program (1990, 1993) by working with parents and teachers at Donaldsonville Elementary School located in Donaldsonville, Louisiana, a small rural southern community. The program's goal was to train parents in effective book-reading practices desired by the school. This led to the second program Edwards developed, Talking Your Way to Literacy: A Program to Help Nonreading Parents Prepare Their Children for Reading (1990). These programs were implemented in schools and libraries; Early Reading First grants, Even Start, Head Start, and Title I programs; and in teenage parent and family centers across the nation. For this work, Edwards received commendations from former Louisiana Congressman Clyde Holloway and the national press‚Äîe.g. The Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, New York Times, and the Milwaukee Journal. Former First Lady Barbara Bush included Edwards's Parents as Partners in Reading program as one of ten promising family literacy programs nationwide in her book First Teachers. In October 1988, Edwards and her Parents as Partners in Reading program were featured in a nationally televised documentary hosted by Phylicia Rashad, \\"First Things First\\" sponsored by Project Literacy U.S. and ABC/WQED Productions. In October 1989, Edwards was highlighted on Dan Rather's Nightly News Series \\"The Best of Us\\" as one of five Americans everyone should know. For Edwards's work with families and children, she received honors from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison: Outstanding African American Alumni Award (1991) and the School of Education Alumni Achievement Award (1995). = Illinois = Resulting from Edwards's family literacy work in Donaldsonville, Louisiana, she was invited to the Center for the Study of Reading at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign during the 1988‚Äì89 school year. There, she continued her investigation into successful approaches for communicating with diverse family populations and transferred her knowledge about families and book reading from her initial research in a rural setting to an urban setting. This work further contributed to her Parents as Partners in Reading and her Talking Your Way to Literacy programs. = Michigan = In the fall of 1989, following her year at the Center for the Study of Reading, Edwards came to Michigan State University. In 1990, Edwards was appointed by U.S. Assistant Secretary John McDonald as an adviser to the First National Goal Readiness for School and was appointed to the Michigan State University Institute for Families, Youth and Children. In 1994, the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) invited Edwards to the first World Symposium on Family Literacy in Paris, France as one of fifty researchers asked to participate in developing a world policy on family literacy and to share current and past research initiatives. At Michigan State University, Edwards, now a Distinguished Professor, continues to investigate ways to involve and support families in their children's literacy development.

Tapping the potential of parents: A strategic guide to boosting student achievement through family involvement. New York: Scholastic Inc. She proposed the concept of differentiated parenting to urge schools not to place all parents into one basket. When schools design programs for parents, one size does not fit all; instead, schools must adapt to fit parents' needs. As schools think about their activities and ways of engaging parents, these avenues must be parentally appropriate in order to make tasks compatible with parents' various capabilities in supporting their children in particular ways as requested by the school. = Literacy in multicultural contexts = Edwards's work advocates for schools to recognize, learn about, and value students' varied home literacies and cultural practices‚Äîsuch as literacies used in African American church services or encouraging students to bring in their own cultural artifacts as an adaptation of sharing time for emergent bilinguals.Protacio, M.S. & Edwards, P.A. (2015). Restructuring sharing time for English learners and their parents. The Reading Teacher, 68(6), 413-421. In the book Bridging Literacy and Equity: The Essential Guide to Social Equity Teaching, Althier Lazar, Patricia Edwards, and Gwendolyn McMillon challenge teachers and schools to abandon deficit ways of thinking and instead embrace culturally responsive practices and social equity teaching by recognizing the diverse resources their students bring, which are likely different from those with which their teachers grew up, and by advocating for their students.

They also provide solutions that connect research, theory, pedagogy, and history to help teachers support their students' literacy development. These solutions include mentoring students, collaborating with community and faith-based organizations, establishing strong school leadership, helping students take ownership of literacy and see it as critical to their lives, and forging positive home-school connections. = Literacy in international contexts = Edwards has long been interested in the question \\"How does the world read?\\"Edwards, P.A. (2010, August/September). How does the world read? Reading Today, 28(1), 22-23. As Vice President of the International Literacy Association (ILA) (formerly International Reading Association), she developed a survey and databank of global literacy practices and ways in which teacher educators worldwide prepare their teachers to teach reading. With assistance from the Director of International Development, councils and national affiliates of the International Literacy Association were asked to share publications and reports about their country's state of education with particular emphasis on literacy development and achievement. They were also asked to share photographs that captured home and school environments as well as artifacts exemplifying literacy materials in their countries. Lastly, they were asked to gather other materials such as stories or audio/video clips of administrators, teachers, parents, and students talking about literacy and how it is used and taught in their countries.

It was established in Shanghai in 1857 by a small group of British and American expatriates as the Shanghai Literary and Scientific Society, and within a year had achieved affiliation with the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland and become the North China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society (NCBRAS). However, following the death of the society's first president, American missionary Elijah Coleman Bridgman, in 1861 the society became moribund, but was rescued in 1864 by Sir Harry Smith Parkes, the British Consul. The Society‚Äôs stated intention was to study and disseminate knowledge of China and surrounding nations by publishing a journal and establishing a library and museum. The first journal was published in 1858 and thereafter for 90 years. The Society‚Äôs original home comprised a ground- floor reading room, library and lecture hall, but was expanded in 1874 to house a museum on the floor above. In 1930 the building was condemned and although funds were raised to build new premises, the Great Depression and the second Sino-Japanese war conspired to prevent any progress. Although the society struggled on it was finally wound up in 1952. The book collection went to the Shanghai Library and most of the museum exhibits to the Shanghai Natural History Museum. In 2006 the society was re-established in Hangzhou and transferred to Shanghai the following year as the Royal Asiatic Society in Shanghai. The Journal has been resurrected and a growing library and museum opened to members and scholars. In 2013 a chapter was established in Beijing as the Royal Asiatic Society in Beijing.

He graduated from Cathedral High School in El Paso.  Education  In 1992, he graduated from St. Mary's University in San Antonio, Texas, with a bachelor's degree in biology. He then earned a Master of Business Administration from the University of Texas at San Antonio, a master's in Hospitality Management from the Hilton College of Hotel and Restaurant Management at the University of Houston, and in 1998 a Juris Doctorate from St. Mary's University School of Law. Pablos was described as the \\"driving force\\" behind the creation of the San Antonio campus of Hilton College, at which he formerly served as adjunct lecturer of hospitality law. Career Pablos formerly served as a Texas Public Utility Commissioner and then chaired the Texas Racing Commission. He was nominated to serve as Texas Secretary of State by Republican Governor Greg Abbott and confirmed by the Texas Senate on February 14, 2017. In March 2017, Pablos made his first international diplomatic mission to Mexico City, during which he affirmed the strong economic relationship between Texas and Mexico. After the trip, Pablos said he was \\"highly encouraged\\" by his meetings and discussions with both private and public sector officials, including representatives from the SENER, Mexico's energy ministry. Pablos co-founded Uriel Americas and served as chief executive officer of the Borderplex Alliance, a bi-national economic developmental corporation. In August 2017, as a new school year loomed, Pablos urged high school principals to register qualified students for voting. The principals, noted Pablos, are required under the state election code to serve as deputy voter registrars, in which capacity they are expected to distribute voter registration applications to students who will turn eighteen by election day.Rolando Pablos, \\"Calling all high school principals to register young voters,\\" San Antonio Express-News, August 18, 2017, p.

This definition is similar to \\"new types of weapons of mass destruction and new systems of such weapons\\" used in documentation from United Nations General Assembly sessions since 1975 and \\"non-lethal weapons\\" used by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Definitions =Weapons using new physical principles= The term is currently used primarily in Russia. The Encyclopedia of the Russian Ministry of Defense identifies the following types of new physical principles weapons that have been developed to varying degrees by the 21st century: * directed energy weapons, like infrasound, laser, and super-high frequency weapons * electromagnetic weapons, such as some lasers and super-high frequency weapons * geophysical weapons, including climate, ozone, environmental, and seismic weapons * genetic weapons * non-lethal arms * radiological weapons =New weapon of mass destruction= New types of \\"weapons of mass destruction and new systems of such weapons\\" were defined by the United Nations General Assembly in 1975. In 1976, the US State Department stated that these weapons are based on \\"qualitatively new principles of action\\", which can be new due to the nature of the impact, target to be attacked, method of action, or how they are used. Examples given were infrasound weapons designed to damage internal organs and affect human behavior; genetic weapons, the use of which would affect the mechanism of heredity; ray weapons capable of affecting blood and intracellular plasma; robotic military equipment; unmanned controlled aircraft; and weapon systems, like aerospace weapon systems, where nuclear weapons are transported by spaceships and thereby more dangerous. In the never-adopted draft treaty of 1975, the proposed language in the United Nations Disarmament Conference classification for \\"new weapons of mass description\\" to be banned included: * radiological means of the non-explosive type acting with the aid of radioactive materials * technical means of inflicting radiation injury based on the use of charged or neutral particles to affect biological targets * infrasonic means using acoustic radiation to affect biological targets * means using electromagnetic radiation to affect biological targets. The Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques of 1977 does not identify specific weapons or technology. =Non-lethal weapons= NATO definition of non-lethal weapons include new responsive technologies‚Äîlike lasers, kinetic and acoustic devices. Examples of non-lethal weapons are counter-personnel and radio-frequency vehicle stopping technologies. The United States Department of Defense's current and future non-lethal weapons programs include active denial, counter- personnel capability that creates a heating sensation, quickly repelling potential adversaries with minimal risk of injury in such missions as force protection, perimeter defense, crowd control, patrols/convoys, defensive and offensive operations.  United Nations conventions  New weapons of mass destruction that have harmful effects on people and the ecological balance of the planet are, in essence, criminal and contrary to the Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques of 1977. Rather than identifying specific weapons, the Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques of 1977 prohibits use of \\"military or any other hostile use of environmental modification techniques having widespread, long- lasting or severe effects as the means of destruction, damage or injury to any other State Party\\". This includes deliberate actions taken to change the atmosphere, hydrosphere, outer space, or in other ways affect the dynamics, structure or composition of the earth. The Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention of 1972. The Seventh Review Conference was held in Geneva in December 2011, which resulted in the Final Declaration document that affirmed that \\"under all circumstances the use of bacteriological (biological) and toxin weapons is effectively prohibited by the Convention\\". The Protocol on Blinding Laser Weapons, Protocol IV of the 1980 Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, was issued by the United Nations on October 13, 1995 and came into force on July 30, 1998.  Weapons development  Russian military doctrine refers to new physical principles weapons, while describing the main features of these weapons as comparable in effect to nuclear weapons but more acceptable in political terms. It was reported in October 2016 that Russia had tested a new electronic weapon, based on new physical principles, that uses directed-energy to neutralize on-board aircraft equipment, unmanned combat aerial vehicles, and precision weapons. In 2015, it announced a blinding weapon, Rook, that creates a disabling light interference, which can be used against night-vision equipment. It uses ultraviolet, infrared, and visible regions of the spectrum and can change the width and direction of the beam to target specific objects. In November 2016, Putin states that the new physical principles weapons comply with all of the country's international obligations.

Biography  Pavel Golohvastov was born on 27 February 1838. His father was Dmitriy Pavlovich Golohvastov. Pavel graduated from the Page Corps. In 1857‚Äì1858, he worked in the Main Archive of the Minister of Internal Affairs; in 1858‚Äì1859, he served in the Asian department. Later, he served as a justice of the peace in Zvenigorodsky uyezd, and then was a managing director of Tashinskiy iron plant. It 1865, acting as President of Nobility in one of the districts of the Moscow province, he demanded a Constitution from the Czar, Alexander the Second, and the Czar is reported to have replied, \\"...I would sign any Constitution you like if I were sure that this would be for the good of Russia. But I know that if I did it to-day, to- morrow Russia would go to pieces.\\" In 1882, Pavel started his service as an official \\"for special orders\\" in the Minister of Internal Affairs under the direction of Nikolay Ignatyev. At that time he was already a well-known authoritative theoretic of Slavophilia. Together with another notable slavophile, Ivan Aksakov, he participated in the preparation of the project of emperor's manifest that should have reanimated Zemsky Sobor. This project made Konstantin Pobedonostsev furious, which immediately forced the resignations of both Golohvastov and the minister. Since a young age, Golohvastov studied the history of the Russian people, especially the period of the Time of Troubles. His legacy includes extensive works (manuscripts mostly), many of which are about Zemsky Sobor. He published several articles in Russky Arkhiv magazine and in the publications of Ivan Aksakov. He was the author of the drama \\"Alesha Popovich, a performance in 5 acts based on the Russian fairy tales\\" (Moscow, 1869), which was warmly accepted by critics and made him famous among contemporary writers. According to Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary, the language he used in his works was heavy, with the strong inclination towards \\"samokovannii\\" (Russian: —Å–∞–º–æ–∫–æ–≤–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–π, self-forged) words. Golohvastov married Olga Andreevna Andreevskaya (1840‚Äì1897), an illegitimate daughter of Evdokiya Rostopchina and Andrey Karamzin (colonel, a son of Nikolay Karamzin, 1814‚Äì1854). She was brought up in Switzerland, in the family of a priest. Olga was close to the community of slavophiles too. As a writer, she was an author of a few psychological plays.

He was a noted activist of the Tangwai movement in touch with many writers of the Taiwan Nativist Literature movement since the mid1970s. He was also, together with Liang Jingfeng and a few others on the Tamkang campus in Tamsui, a key mover of a new political direction in native folk music.See: \\"Danjiang-Xiachao luxian de minge yundong (shang)\\" ( Ê∑°Ê±üÔºçÂ§èÊΩÆ Ë∑ØÁ∑öÁöÑÊ∞ëÊ≠åÈÅãÂãïÔºà‰∏äÔºâ/ On the Tamkang Xiachiao (China Tide) Line of the Folk Movement), in the journal: „ÄäDaoyu bianyuan Â≥∂Â∂ºÈÇäÁ∑£ Isle Margins„Äã, issue 5/1992Ôºöpp. 96-107.  A tutor and then a young activist teacher in Tamkang Wang Jinping was first a tutor and then a full-time teacher at the Dept. of English of Tamkang College of Arts and Sciences, now Tamkang University, in Tamsui in the 1970s. In 1974, when Wang was a tutor at Tamkang, he met Malieyafusi Monaneng (b. 1956), a member of one of Taiwan's aboriginal tribes whose Chinese name is Mo Na-neng (Ëé´ÈÇ£ËÉΩ).See the article on Ëé´ÈÇ£ËÉΩ Mo Naneng in the Chinese Wikipedia Ëé´ÈÇ£ËÉΩ. This heralded Wang Jinping's and Liang Jingfeng's as well as Lee Yuan-chen's and Li Shuangze's interested in aboriginal culture, especially aboriginal folk songs. Together with two other members of the Faculty of Literature, Lee Yuan-chen (Li Yuanzhen ÊùéÂÖÉË≤û - the founder of Women Awakening), Liang Jingfeng, and the noted composer, poet, painter and folksinger Li Shuangze (ÊùéÈõôÊæ§), Wang Jinping belonged to the group on the Tamkang campus in Tamsui that was called the \\"gang of four\\" radical pro- democracy activists. Thus, he was one of those who gave rise to the Tamkang- Xiachiao (China Tide) Line of the Folk Movement.See Zhang Nansheng's (ÂºµÂçóÁîü) article, \\"Danjiang-Xiachao luxian de minge yundong (shang)\\" ( Ê∑°Ê±üÔºçÂ§èÊΩÆ Ë∑ØÁ∑öÁöÑÊ∞ëÊ≠åÈÅãÂãïÔºà‰∏äÔºâ/ On the Tamkang Xiachiao (China Tide) Line of the Folk Movement), in the journal: „ÄäDaoyu bianyuan Â≥∂Â∂ºÈÇäÁ∑£ Isle Margins„Äã, issue 5/1992Ôºöpp. 96-107. This political line, pursued within the new folk song (xin minggeÊñ∞Ê∞ëÊ≠å ) movement, was propagated by the Xiachao Magazine(Â§èÊΩÆ) founded in 1976, a Tangwai movement magazine in which the four Tamkang-based pro-democracy activists published articles at the time.Liang Jinfeng used the pseudonym Liang Deming. See: Samia Ferhat-Dana, Le Dangwai et la D√©mocratie √† Ta√Øwan: Une lutte pour la reconnaissance de l'entit√© politique ta√Øwanaise (1949-1986), Paris : L'Harmattan, 1998 , 9782296369672. Soon, the aboriginal singer and blues poet Hu Defu also joined the dissident group which then began to pioneer xin minge (Êñ∞Ê∞ëÊ≠ånew folk songs) in Taiwan. Already in 1974, Mo Naneng, who later became a noted aboriginal poet and aboriginal rights activist, had \\"spent about one or two months in Wang Jinping's hostel\\".See the article on Ëé´ÈÇ£ËÉΩ Mo Naneng in the Chinese Wikipedia. Mo then \\"traveled with some Han friends (i.e. Chinese friends) who cared about Taiwan's aborigines\\" - including Wang Jinping ‚Äì to areas with aboriginal villages, in search of their culture and music.See the article on Ëé´ÈÇ£ËÉΩ Mo Naneng in the Chinese Wikipedia. While Mo had kindled an interest in aboriginal culture in Wang Jinping and Wang's Mainland Chinese, Taiwanese, and Hakka friends, it was above all Wang Jinping who aroused an interest in Taiwan Nativist Literature in Mo. And thus, Mo \\" got to know Wang Tuoh, Su Qingli, Li Shuangze, Chen Yingzhen, Yang Qingchu, Huang Chunming, Wang Lixia, Chen Guoying, Chen Wanzhen, Yang Zujun, Lin Zhengjie, Zhang Fuzhong, Song Dongwen and others, many of them in the Tangwai movement\\" ‚Äì meeting them personally thanks to Wang Jinping, in 1977-1978.See the article on Ëé´ÈÇ£ËÉΩ Mo Naneng in the Chinese Wikipedia. Like Liang Jingfeng, Wang Jinping was a very close friend of Li Shuangze. He also formed close links with the blues poet and aboriginal singer Hu Defu in the 1970s.\\"Hu Defu... Yang Hsien and Li Shuangze, the(se) three singers were regarded as pioneers of Taiwan's folk song movement starting from 1975.\\" All of this happened at a time described by the Global Times as \\"one of the most turbulent periods for Taiwan both socially and regarding the people's spiritual development.\\" In December 1976, the radical Tamkang-based pro-democracy and pro-Taiwan Nativist Literature activists, including Wang Jinping, were pulling the strings that led to the so-called Coca Cola Incident (Tamkang Incident). They motivated the student body to invite Hu Defu to perform at the annual English-language Western folk concert at Tamkang. And when Hu Defu could not come, Li Shuangze stepped in as the replacement, went on stage, asked the other singers and the audience, Where are our songs? Why don't you sing our songs? And then, smashing a Coke bottle, a symbol of CocaCola-ization, on stage, shouted: \\"We should sing our songs!!\\" There was a storm of criticism of Li Shuangze's act, in the KMT-controlled press, and it made the new folk song movement that returned to the roots really famous, islandwide. It really pushed it forward. Soon after that, Wang Jinping, Liang Jingfeng and Lee Yuan-chen managed to get Chen Da invited to the Tamkang campus by the students, and then they started to distribute clandestine tapes with new folk songs ‚Äì many of which had soon been banned by the GIO censors. Then, the group of four, supported by other close friends, organized a \\"new folk song\\" concert in Taipei New Park today renamed 228 Peace Memorial Park, in memory of the bloody massacres committed by the KMT's army and military police in Kaohsiung, Taipei, Chiayi, Keelung and many other places under the eyes of their American supervisors on 28 February 1947 and shortly after that fateful day, killing at least 30,000 human beings (a \\"conservative estimate\\").Studebaker trucks then drove all night long for several days to Tanhai, just north of Tamsui, throwing dead bodies stuffed into rice flour bags into the sea. Many corpses washed ashore or ending up in the nets of fishermen were buried in Bali (see Bali District, just opposite Tamsui, at the foot of Mt. Guanyin (see Mount Guanyin (New Taipei) by grieving fisherfolk. In 1977 or 1978, Wang Jinping was fired by Tamkang College which bowed to KMT pressure. It was because of Wang's outspoken pro-Tangwai movement positions that he did not hide from the students. In addition to embracing the idea of unification with China (but in a way that was very different from the KMT's \\"re-conquest\\" ideas), Wang was also an internationalist and he cared for Third World literature, especially African literature. He thought highly of Basil Davidson. There were informers among the students who wrote reports on what faculty members and students said, and handed them in to the army officers stationed for that purpose on campus. Wang kept in touch with his students. In addition to the boarding house, he now had also a bookstore in Tamsui that was frequented by the students and that offered books by Taiwan Nativist Literature authors and sold magazines like Xiachao. When Wang Jingping's friend Mo Naneng had a severe accident in 1979 that implied eye damage and then turned him blind, it was noted left-wing author Chen YimgzhenChen is the writer who is seen both in Taiwan and the PR China as Taiwan's most important author. See: Jeffrey C. Kinkley, \\"From Oppression to Dependency: Two Stages in the Fiction of Chen Yingzhen\\".

See the article on Ëé´ÈÇ£ËÉΩ Mo Naneng in the Chinese Wikipedia. Wang Jinping, just like the others of the small group at Tamkang and like most writers of the Taiwan Nativist Literature movement, wholeheartedly supported aboriginal rights. When Mo and Hu Defu succeeded to establish the Taiwan Aboriginal Peoples' Rights Promotion Association in late 1984, some two and half years before Martial Law was lifted by the KMT regime, Wang was on their side.\\"In December 1984, Mona was able to establish the Taiwan Aboriginal Peoples' Rights Promotion Association together with the singer Hu Defu, who was a member of the \\"Promotion Committee\\" of the Taiwan Aboriginal Peoples' Rights Association. Mona Neng's poem, \\"Restore Our Name\\", was created for the Taiwan Aboriginal Peoples' Rights Association. Breach with old companions of the struggle for democracy? While the four democracy activists dreamed of a united China in 1976, hoping that thus their goals of full democracy for the common people and real social justice would be fulfilled, Liang Jingfeng has since been quoted very often as saying that \\"my China is Taiwan...\\"See Samia Ferhat-Dana, Le Dangwai et la D√©mocratie √† Ta√Øwan: Une lutte pour la reconnaissance de l'entit√© politique ta√Øwanaise (1949-1986), Paris : L'Harmattan, 1998 , 9782296369672. In contrast to this position, which favors Taiwan independence, Wang Jinping and Chen Yingzhen have clung to the dream of democratic unification of the motherland. Recently, Chen Yingzhen critiqued the Taiwan independence movement by saying that the Taiwanese majority should not claim victim status vis-a-vis the Chinese (on the island or on the mainland) because both the mainlanders and the Taiwanese had suppressed and colonized Taiwan's aboriginal population. Chen Yingzhen also put in question the \\"Hoklo-centrist\\" - thus Taiwanese \\"nativist hegemony\\" that emerged \\"in the 1980s and 1990s.\\" Wang Jinping agrees with these views and critiques the Taidu movement or Taiwan Independence Movement, too.See Pei-Yin Lin, \\"Literature's Role in Breaching the Authoritarian Mindset,\\" in the book: The Vitality of Taiwan: Politics, Economics, Society and Culture , edited by Steve Tsang, London and Basingstole (UK) : Palgrave Macmillan, 2012. . With regard to Chen Yingzheng, his Hakka roots may play a role, as the Hakka minority has been treated by many Taiwanese quite condescendingly. \\"Chen was born into a Hakka community in Zhunan, and later on moved with hin parents to Yingge, another Hakka county in northern Taiwan. In his memoirs, Chen also discusses...\\" the role \\"of the KMT government that continued to pursue internal colonization and terrorized the Taiwanese people as well as mainland Chinese refugees who came ... between 1947 and 1949...\\"; see: Peng-Hui Liao. \\"Modern Taiwan literature\\", in: Routledge Handbook of Contemporary Taiwan, edited by Gunter Schubert, London and New York, 2016, p.365. .

Despite the diversity of the membership, there is a common understanding that the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait are Chinese and that both sides belong to one China. The China Union for Unification opposes \\"Taiwan independence\\" and \\"separatism.\\" in which Chen Yingzhen also played a leading role.\\"Taiwan's famous Nativist literature writer Chen Yingzhen was elected as the first president\\" (of the China Union for Unification), \\"the current president is ...Taiwan University Professor Wang Jinping.

It is a sprawling shrub with its branches densely covered with white, woolly hairs. Its leaves are rough and wrinkled and the flowers are deep pink or dark red, curved and tube-shaped with spreading petal lobes on the end. Description Hemiphora exserta is a sprawling shrub which grows to a height of with its branches covered with woolly hairs but which become glabrous with age. The leaves are linear to narrow lance-shaped, long, wide, with their edges strongly curved downwards. The upper surface is rough and wrinkled with small blisters and the lower surface is covered with short, soft hairs when young. The flowers are arranged singly or in groups of up to three on woolly stalks long, in upper leaf axils. There are bracts long at the base of the flowers and which are glabrous on the inner surface and densely woolly outside, and there are shorter, glabrous bracteoles. The five sepals are long, and joined at their base to form a short tube. The sepals are scaly on the outside, linear to lance-shaped and remain attached to the plant after the petals have fallen. The petals are deep pink to dark red, long and joined to form a downward-curving tube, long and wide at the top end. The petal tube has soft hairs on the outside but glabrous inside except for a densely hairy ring around the ovary. The five petal lobes form two \\"lips\\", the upper lip with two short lobes and the lower with three. The lower central lobe is almost twice as large as the other four, elliptic to almost circular in shape, long and wide while the others are more or less egg- shaped. The four stamens are about the same length as the petal tube with the lower pair longer than the upper pair. Flowering occurs from June to November and the fruit is almost spherical, hairy and in diameter. Taxonomy and naming This species was first formally described in 1870 by George Bentham who gave it the name Pityrodia uncinata var. exserta. The description was published in Flora Australiensis. In 1979, Ahmad Abid Munir raised the variety to species status as Pityrodia exserta, but in 2011, Barry Conn, Murray Henwood and Nicola Streiber transferred four species, including this one, from the genus Pityrodia into Hemiphora. The specific epithet (exserta) is a Latin word meaning \\"projecting\\" or \\"thrust forward\\". Distribution and habitat Hemiphora exserta is found in the Fitzgerald River National Park in the Esperance Plains biogeographic region where it grows on rocky slopes and undulating plains. Conservation Hemiphora exserta is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.

She was on the consultative steering group that advised on procedural aspects when the new Scottish Parliament was being set up. Her work included promoting the equal representation of women. She was the first Scottish Public Services Ombudsman, serving for two terms between 2002 and 2009, and was a member of the Administrative Justice and Tribunals Council 2008‚Äì2012. She was a member of the Committee on Standards in Public Life 1998‚Äì2003 and was elected as the first female General Secretary of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (RSE) 2011‚Äì2013. She has been chair of the Scottish Funding Council since 2013. Early life Brown left school at age 15 to work for a small insurance company, later returning to Stevenson College to get her Higher examinations through evening classes. In 1983, at age of 37, she graduated from the University of Edinburgh with first-class honours in economics and politics. Academic career In 1984 Brown took a temporary academic position at the University of Stirling, lecturing in Economics. The following year she began working for the University of Edinburgh as a lecturer. With some funding from the Economic and Social Research Council she studied the work of Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (Acas) and went on to complete a PhD with her research. She was promoted to the head of the Politics department in 1995 and then was given a personal chair in Politics in 1997. She became Vice-Principal of the University in 1999. Scottish Parliament After the Scottish electorate voted for a parliament in the devolution referendum in September 1997, a group was set up the following month that was tasked with drawing up detailed proposals for the standing orders to be used in the new Scottish Parliament. Brown was a member of this consultative steering group which reported to the Secretary of State for Scotland, Donald Dewar, in December 1998. In 1998 Brown became involved with the governance of Scotland forum. The Institute of Governance at the University of Edinburgh was established in 1999 with Brown as a founding Co- Director. She was also part of Labour's panel to vet their prospective candidates for the 1999 Scottish Parliament election. Brown was known for being a champion of gender equality, and her work contributed towards a better gender balance in the 1st Scottish Parliament. She was a member of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, first appointed on 1 November 1998 and reappointed on 1 November 2001. Ombudsman In 2002, the parliament made preparations to replace a confusing system of several ombudsman offices which had been in operation since before the new parliament was set up. The changes were to allow a convenient way for members of the public to make complaints about a range of organisations providing public services. After some debate about whether the title of the person leading the service should be gender- neutral, the new legislation created the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman. In June 2002 a cross-party selection panel nominated Brown to lead this service, with Presiding Officer David Steel having the casting vote. Parliament then approved the nomination. Brown's appointment was then made by the Queen on 30 September 2002, taking up all her functions and powers from 23 October 2002. As the ombudsman, she was assisted by three part-time deputy ombudsmen and 38 members of staff. On taking up the ombudsman post she stepped down from her university position and from the Committee on Standards in Public Life. After serving a first term of five years, the Scottish Parliament approved the nomination for her to be reappointed in March 2007. Her second term of office lasted two years, and she was succeeded by Jim Martin who took office in 1 May 2009. She was appointed to the Administrative Justice and Tribunals Council for a four-year period from 1 December 2008. She led the team that wrote Right First Time, a report that was published in June 2011, advising that the decision-making processes used by public bodies generally needed to improve. Other appointments In 2011 she was elected the first female General Secretary of the RSE. a position she resigned in October 2013 on her appointment as chair of the Scottish Funding Council. In 2019 she was appointed the first female chancellor of Abertay University. Awards and honours In 2002, she became an Academician, later known as a Fellow of the Academy of Social Sciences. She was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (FRSE) in 2002. The University of Edinburgh made her an Emeritus Professor in 2008. In 2009 she was chosen to receive a Special Recognition Award by the Political Studies Association. She was appointed Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2010 New Year Honours for public service. She has been bestowed with honorary degrees from the University of Edinburgh in 2010, Edinburgh Napier University in 2009, the University of Stirling in 2004, Glasgow Caledonian University in 2012 and the University of Aberdeen in 2016.

It is known among archeologists for the epipaleolithic culture known as Tardenoisian after its characteristic arrowheads, originally found at Coincy in the Tardenois in 1885. The etymology of \\"Tardenois\\" is not known. Originally, the Tardenois was a pagus (subdivision) of the civitas (state) of the Suessiones. After the Gallic Wars (58‚Äì50 BC), the Suessiones were subjected to the Remi, who were loyal allies of the Roman Empire. In the Middle Ages, it became a county (comitatus) under the Carolingians, subject to visits by missi dominici (lord's envoys). It is mentioned in 853 as the pagus tardinisus. The border between the dioceses of Soissons and Reims ran through it. In 858, King Charles the Bald appointed a certain Northmannus, possibly a former Viking, as count in the Tardenois. He was still count in 868, when he got into a conflict with the Bishop Hincmar of Laon that was settled by the king in his favour.Janet L. Nelson, \\"England and the Continent in the Ninth Century: II, the Vikings and Others\\", Transactions of the Royal Historical Society, 13 (2003), pp. 1‚Äì28, at 16‚Äì17 Hincmar, archbishop of Reims, records around 870 that the Tardenois was under a count named Bertram, a relative of his, who exercised the bannum and held placita. The Tardenois was at that time a typical Carolingian county.Charles West, Reframing the Feudal Revolution: Political and Social Transformation Between Marne and Moselle, c. 800‚Äìc. 1100 (Cambridge University Press, 2013), p. 22. As the system of pagi, and the comital system based upon it, decayed, the borders of the ancient pagi were forgotten. Villages not once part of the Tardenois became regarded as within it and some that had belonged to it did no longer. The term came to refer to an imprecise geographical zone. It was still regarded as a county in the late eleventh century, when it was part of the domains of Ralph IV (1038‚Äì74) and his son Simon (1074‚Äì77), counts of Valois. Pierre Feuch√®re, \\"Une tentative manqu√©e de concentration territoriale entre Somme et Seine: La principaut√© d'Amiens-Valois au Xle si√®cle: √âtude de g√©ographie historique\\", Le Moyen √Çge, 4e s√©rie, 9 (1956), pp. 1‚Äì37, at 14. By the twelfth century, it was a part of the county of Champagne. During the First World War, the Tardenois was the site of intense fighting. During 22‚Äì26 July 1918, the Italian 2nd Corps, supported by two British divisions, launched an offensive that drove the Germans back behind F√®re-en-Tardenois. This is known as the battle of Tardenois.Michael S. Neiberg, The Second Battle of the Marne (Indiana University Press, 2008), pp. 140‚Äì59. Today, the Tardenois natural region lies partly in the department of Marne in the region of Grand Est and partly in Aisne in the region of Hauts-de-France. Since 1996, the municipalities of the Tardenois have been divided into two communaut√©s de communes (municipal federations): that of Tardenois, which lies entirely in Aisne, and that of Ardre et Tardenois, which lies entirely in Marne. Municipalities named after the Tardenois *Coulonges-en-Tardenois *F√®re-en-Tardenois *Fresnes-en- Tardenois *Ville-en-Tardenois Likewise, there are two cantons named in part after the region: the Canton of F√®re-en-Tardenois and the Canton of Ville-en- Tardenois. There are also the ruins of a 13th-century castle known as the Ch√¢teau de F√®re-en-Tardenois.

From May 1966 to February 1967, known as Fred A. Evelyn, he was on meteorological officer training in Ottawa, Toronto, and CFB Trenton with John Gordon, Bob Clibbon, Brian Mason, Dave Philips, Alfred Warkentin, and David Hagborg amongst others. In 1969, he traveled to England. Upon his return in 1970, he briefly held scientific positions in Montr√©al while simultaneously starting to paint as an autodidact.See: Nature-D-NatureD. Aachen and Rotterdam: Symposium Press 2003, p. 45. He soon moved back to Europe and Morocco, however, \\"filling many sketchbooks with drawings and small paintings.\\"Ibidem, p. 45. Returning to Montreal in 1971, he resumed his scientific position at McGill University. In 1973, he left Canada, settling down in West Berlin where he enrolled in the Free University of Berlin, earning his livelihood as a painter of billboards for major commercial fairs and exhibitions, while also applying for admission at the Berlin art academy.Ibidem, p. 45. ‚Äì According to another source, he settled down in Germany in 1974. See: Keith Tribe, in: Angelo Evelyn. Gemaelde 1978-1984 Paintings (Bremen, Graphothek 1984), text in German and English. Art School In 1978, Evelyn learned that he would be admitted by the Bremen art academy (now the University of the Arts Bremen but known at the time as Hochschule f√ºr Gestaltung). Here, he studied painting and 3D design since 1979, obtaining a diploma in 2D design in 1983.\\"Tra il 1979 e il 1983 ha studiato pittura e grafica presso l'Accademia di Design e Musica di Brema (Germania).\\" See: Incontri con la paleontologia, V edizione [‚Ä¶], ibidem.

Having obtained his diploma, the artist moved to Paris in 1983, renting a small studio and engaging in printmaking (using aluminum plates) at the Cit√© des Artes. The results of his creative work in Paris were presented in Bremen in 1985 in a large solo exhibition entitled Collage - Print - Stencil.See: Nature-D- NatureD, ibidem, p.46. = In Germany = In 1985, Evelyn moved from Paris to Aachen, Germany, a provincial town close to the Belgian and Dutch border, where he was able to rent a large studio. In the same year, he had an exhibition at the gallery of Radio Omroep Zuid in Maastricht (The Netherlands).Ibidem, p.46. During the next year, he exhibited \\"in the Suermondt-Ludwig Museum\\"< and had an important solo exhibition in the \\"Neuer Aachener Kunstverein\\", both in Aachen, Germany. In that year, he was also artist-in-residence at the Frans Masereel Centre in Kasterlee (Belgium).Ibidem, p.46. ‚Äì Cf. During this period, he sought to reach perfection as a printmaker by taking part in advanced courses in printmaking at the Frans-Masereel Centrum and in other advanced courses, offered by the Czech artist Rudolf Broulim at the RHok (Royal Academy of Arts) Brussels,In Flemish, it is called RhoK ‚Äì Instituut Beeldend Kunstonderwijs van de Vlaamse Gemeenschap; in Belgium, the two parts of the country, the French-speaking Wallonie and Flemish-speaking Flanders, each have their separate political and cultural institutions, distinct art academies, universities, etc. where he also had a solo exhibition.See: Nature-D-NatureD, ibidem, p. 46. ‚Äì See also Incontri con la paleontologia, V edizione [‚Ä¶], ibidem, which noted that \\"[...] ha approfondito le sue conoscenze di grafica partecipando a vari seminari avanzati tenuti da Franz Masereel presso il Kasterlee Centrum in Belgio, da Rijks Hoger Kunstonderwijs a Bruxelles [...]\\". See also: http://www.tbg.de/online-katalog-blue-genes.pdfx. In 1987, Evelyn was commissioned to do the stage decor for a performance by Tone Brulin's company at the Studio Theater in Trondheim (Norway). The work Evelyn was commissioned to do by Tone Brulin was for Brulin's play Turandot.\\"'Turandot' av Tone Brulin. [‚Ä¶] Regi: Tone Brulin. Scenografi: Angelo Evelyn. Studio Teater. 1985\\", in: SCENEWEB, http://www.sceneweb.no/nb/artist/2111/Bj√∏rn_Myrholdt. It was noteworthy that an avant-garde artist like Tone Brulin would choose Angelo Evelyn for the job.Tone Brulin had been a pioneer of the experimental theater in Belgium since the 1950s. \\"Perhaps the most important chamber theatre of the 1950s in Antwerp was the Theater op Zolder (Theatre in the Loft), later called the Nederlands Kamertoneel (Dutch Chamber Theatre). Founded in 1953 by Tone Brulin (b. 1926), the company had a particular interest in new Flemish authors...\\", according to Toon Brouwers, Alfons van Impe, Jaak van Schoor, \\"Flemish Community (Belgium)\\", in: Don Rubin (ed.) , World Encyclopedia of Contemporary Theatre: Vol. 1: Europe. London and New York : Routledge 2014 (paperback edition), p.119. (1st edition 1994). ‚Äì \\"Tone Brulin [‚Ä¶] was one of the first, if not the first, to embark on bold new theatrical ventures.\\" His \\"experiments\\" are described as significant. Paul van Morckhoven, Luc Andr√©, The Contemporary Theatre in Belgium, Brussels : Belgian Information and Documentation Institute 1970, p.39. Tone Brulin is also mentioned by Mike Sell as an avantgarde \\"playwright and dramatist\\" (who gave workshops in the U.S.). M. Sell notes that \\"Brulin's work in the theater was deeply influenced by the poor theater of Jerzy Grotowski and Eugenio Barba, which attempted to purify the form of the techniques and traditions that undermined global brotherhood by stripping theater down to its barest essentials: the actor's body and the cleared performance space.\\" The American group that Brulin gave workshops for at Antioch College, Ohio, learned from him how to create \\"true people's theater\\". Mike Sell, Avant-garde Performance & the Limits of Criticism: Approaching the Living Theatre, Happening/Fluxus, and the Black Arts Movement. Ann Arbor, Mich.: Univ. of Michigan Press, 2008, p. 23. = In Norway = In 1988, Evelyn moved to Trondheim. Apparently, this was because Evelyn's Dutch wife Annie who had worked as an actress with the Cirque de Soleil, and who had performed in Brulin's Turandot, had obtained a job teaching Commedia dell'arte at the University of Trondheim (now the Norwegian University of Science and Technology) in 1987. The two rented a farm house in Leinstrand (or Tr√∏ndelag?) near Trondheim, where he established his new studio.See: Nature-D-NatureD, ibidem, p.47. The years in Norway are marked by seascapes inspired not only by the sea as such. They also comprised ecological themes that echoed his awareness of the Norwegian whaling industry and the industrial traces of the North Sea oil boom. Others were apparently tracing memories of tales heard about his father who was a captain in the Canadian navy during the war, in command of one of those ships that protected freighters on their way from North America to Murmansk.Ibidem, p. 47. In both 1988 and 1989, Evelyn participated in the annual H√∏stutstilling, or Statens KunstutstillingSee: H√∏stutstillingen at the :no:Kunstnernes Hus or Artists House in Oslo, Norway which is described as the \\"viktigste\\" (most important) art exhibition in that country. He also received a large grant or stipend from the Norwegian government in 1989. In this year he had also solo exhibitions in Stavanger and in Molde (both in Norway).Nature-D-NatureD, ibidem, p. 47. = Norway and Germany = While in Norway, Evelyn returned to Germany frequently to organize his exhibitions, among them the big exhibition in Bremen (Lilienthal) entitled \\"Bilder aus Norwegen und vom Kontinent\\" (Paintings from Norway and the Continent). = In the Netherlands = He finally moved from Trondheim to the Rotterdam area in 1993. In the Netherlands, he had difficulties initially to find an appropriate studio, and got involved instead in a Hilversum artist cooperative, the Grafisch Atelier t'Gooi.Ibidem, p. 48. ‚Äì The Grafisch Atelier t'Gooi, established in 1968 with support from the City of Hilversum, is one of the oldest \\"open workshops\\" in Holland specifically for artists engaging in printmaking. \\"Open\\" means accessible for artists who join the cooperative. (\\"Grafisch Atelier 't Gooi werd in 1968 met steun van de gemeente Hilversum opgericht en is een van de oudste open werkplaatsen van Nederland.\\") See the webpage of the Dutch profession journal Museumstijdschrift, http://museumtijdschrift.nl/artspot/grafisch-atelier-t-gooi/. Activities in Canada, Germany, Britain, etc. In the same year, he had two solo exhibitions in Canada.Ibidem, p. 48. And the next year, a group exhibition in the RHoK Art Academy in Brussels, together with two other artists, Niek Satijn and Erik Fliek, that was also shown in Hilversum.The group exhibition received financial support from the cultural section of the Canadian Embassy in Brussels, from the Province South Holland, the City of Hilversum, and the foundation Stichting Voorzieningsfonds voor Kunstenaars. In 1998, Evelyn founded an international print workshop (the Lithografie Werkstatt Eichstaett) together with two other artists, Li Portenlaenger and Armin Nischk.See: Nature-D-NatureD, ibidem, p.48. ‚Äì See, in addition Incontri con la paleontologia, V edizione [‚Ä¶], ibidem, which has this information about the artist: \\"Ha istituito nel 1998 ad Eichstatt (Baviera) insieme a due colleghi artisti tedeschi, uno studio internazionale della pietra litografica dove artisti tedeschi e stranieri vengono invitati per trascorrere un periodo partecipando ad un percorso artistico.\\"See also http://www.lithos- jura.de/02werkstattE00.html , as well as the online version of the catalogue Blue Genes: http://www.tbg.de/online-katalog-blue-genes.pdfx and see: https://www.flickr.com/photos/engramme/4793465359 which confirms that \\"En 1998, il fonde un centre international de lithographie √† Eichstatt, en Bavi√®re.\\" Simultaneously, the three artists staged the event \\"200 Jahre Lithographie\\" in public space and the university as well as in the cathedral Notre Dame de Sacre Coeur in Eichstaett (from July 26 to Aug. 18, 1998).See: Helga K√∂nig (ed.; comp.), Vierzig Jahre Ausstellungen und Ver√∂ffentlichungen der Universit√§tsbibliothek Eichstaett-Ingolstadt 1964-2004, Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Publishing House, 2004, pp.XX. In the same year (1998), he also obtained an M.A. in print-making from the Wimbledon School of Art (Wimbledon College of Art, Wimbledon nr. London, England).See http://www.unfuturoasud.it/docs/Abstract-Paleo5.pdf and http://www.tbg.de/online-katalog-blue-genes.pdfx. In September 2005, Evelyn had a joint exhibition in the Atelier Circulaire in Montreal together with the Canadian artist Ana Francine B√©land.See: Centres d'artistes autog√©r√©s du Qu√©bec 2005 / Programmation d'automne http://www.rcaaq.org/fichiers/membres/pdf/prog_aut_2005.pdf . In 2005-2006, Angelo Evelyn and two other artists, Li Portenl√§nger and Luc Piron, as well as a poet based in Aachen, cooperated on a joint project to artistically reflect the anti-war essence and physical as well as aesthetic reality of a large ensemble of bigger-than-lifesize sculptures embedded in the Jurassic landscape near Eichst√§tt.See the article \\"Vier K√ºnstler n√§hern sich dem \\"Figurenfeld\\"\\", in the South German daily Donaukurier, Nov. 4, 2005, also accessible online: http://www.donaukurier.de/lokales/eichstaett/5E-Figuren05-K-Vier-Kuenstler- naehern-sich-dem-Figurenfeld;art575,1236864 (registration and payment required, in order to access the complete article). The ensemble of sculptures, known locally as the Figurenfeld (field of figures) was created by the sculptor A. W√ºnsche-Mitterecker, as an early example of land art. It represented a post-battle scene of slaughter and horrid death.

On Nov. 24, 2008, the Donaukurier featured both Evelyn and his artist colleague Wolfgang Schmitz, discussing their exhibition. This daily has repeatedly focused on Evelyn, most recently in Feb. 2014, when the Donaukurier interviewed Evelyn.See: Donaukurier, 24 Feb. 2014. An official Eichstaett county (Landkreis Eichstatt) publication refers to him as \\"this globally renowned artist\\" (\\"diesen weltbekannten K√ºnstler\\").The publication is also available online. See: http://www.landkreis- eichstaett.de/Startseite/Suche.aspx?view=~/kxp/orgdata/default&orgid;=5f19d832-5b62-4826-9b99-e8b0cf73dd51. It was also in 2008 that Evelyn was artist in residence in Val-David, Quebec, Canada, creating lithographic prints at the Atelier de l'√éle de Val-David.See also Val-David's Symposium International d'art nature multidiciplinaire and Songes d'√©t√©, \\"un √©v√©nement culturel d'arts visuels, de sculpture, musique et danse .\\" He also had a solo exhibition in the Atelier de l'√éle in that year.

The earliest segment of the North End Subdivision was built in 1833 by the Petersburg Railroad from Petersburg, Virginia to Weldon, North Carolina. In 1838, the Richmond and Petersburg Railroad was built from just south of Richmond to Petersburg connecting with the Petersburg Railroad. After the Richmond and Petersburg Railroad was completed, the Richmond and Petersburg Railroad Bridge was built over the James River (which was located just west of the present-day Manchester Bridge). Ruins of this bridge still remain today. In 1840, the Wilmington and Weldon Railroad was built at the southern end of the Petersburg Railroad south to Rocky Mount (which continued to Wilson, North Carolina). The Richmond and Petersburg Railroad, Petersburg Railroad, and the Wilmington and Weldon Railroad would all become part the main line of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad in 1900. In 1891, the current track crossing of the James River was built by the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad and the Richmond and Petersburg Railroad. Known as the Belt Line, it was built as a freight bypass to the original route. The first bridge over the river on this route was replaced by the current arch bridge in 1919, which was built jointly by the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad and the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad. Some of the foundations of the previous bridge remain beside the current structure.

Background  Su Yugui was born in 895, during the reign of Emperor Zhaozong of Tang. His ancestors were said to be from Wugong (Ê≠¶Âäü, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi), but for several generations had lived in Gaomi (È´òÂØÜ, in modern Weifang, Shandong). His father Su Zhongrong () was known for being well-learned in Confucianism in their home territory. At one point, Su Zhongrong passed the imperial examination in the Mingjing () class, and was made an assistant professor at the imperial university; he later served as the magistrate of Futang County (ËºîÂîê, in modern Weifang). Su Yugui himself was said to be humble and peaceful, taking after his father in studies. He, like his father, passed the Mingjing examinations, and was thereafter made a staff member of the prefect of Liao Prefecture (ÈÅºÂ∑û, in modern Jinzhong, Shanxi). (It is unclear when this occurred, but it must have occurred after the fall of Tang's successor state Later Liang, as during Later Liang, Liao Prefecture belonged to Later Liang's rival Jin; it thus occurred either during Later Tang or Later Jin.) He later served successively as secretary to the military governors (Jiedushi) of Pinglu (Âπ≥Áõß, headquartered in modern Weifang) and Tianping (Â§©Âπ≥, headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong) Circuits, and then as the treasurers of Zhaoyi (Êò≠Áæ©, headquartered in modern Changzhi, Shanxi) and Hedong (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi) Circuits. After the major Later Jin general Liu Zhiyuan was made the military governor of Hedong in 941,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 282. he made Su his assistant in his role as governor (ËßÄÂØü‰Ωø, Guanchashi) of Hedong.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 286.  During Later Han  = During Liu Zhiyuan's reign = In 947, Later Jin was destroyed by its northern neighbor Liao (Khitan), and Liao's Emperor Taizong claimed to be the emperor of China as well. Liu Zhiyuan initially postured as if he were going to submit to Liao, but soon declared himself emperor (of an initially unnamed state, but later known as Later Han). He made Su Yugui and another assistant, Su Fengji, chancellors, both with the titles of Zhongshu Shilang () and Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (). After Liu was subsequently able to take over the Central Plains, Su Yugui received the additional title of minister of justice (ÂàëÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Xingbu Shangshu). As Liao's Emperor Taizong had taken the Later Jin chancellors Feng Dao and Li Song north, Liu awarded Feng's mansion to Su Yugui and Li's mansion to Su Fengji.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 288. It was said that Su Fengji and Su Yugui were deeply trusted by the emperor, such that no one could alienate him from them; he entrusted them with all governmental matters, while entrusting all military matters to Yang Bin and Guo Wei. At Su Fengji's recommendations, Liu made Li Tao, as well as Dou Zhengu, chancellors as well, joining the Sus, in fall 947, as he was set to join the generals Gao Xingzhou and Murong Yanchao (Liu's half-brother) against the rebellious general Du Chongwei. At that time, Su Yugui received the title of You Pushe ().Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 287. = During Liu Chengyou's reign = Liu Zhiyuan died in spring 948, and was succeeded by his young son Liu Chengyou, whom he entrusted to Su Fengji, Yang Bin, Shi Hongzhao, and Guo Wei. Early in Liu Chengyou's reign, the high-level officials were in a collective leadership, with different responsibilities. However, Yang Bin, as chief of staff (Shumishi), oversaw the government overall,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 289. and when the chancellors, led by Su Fengji, wanted to promote officials and fill unfilled positions, Yang saw the requests as wasteful and often rejected them, causing the chancellors to be displeased. In spring 948, Li Tao submitted a petition to Liu Chengyou suggesting that Yang and Guo Wei (who was then deputy chief of staff) be given military commands outside the capital and that key matters be decided by Su Fengji and Su Yugui. When Yang and Guo heard of this, they went to see Liu Chengyou's mother (Liu Zhiyuan's wife) Empress Dowager Li, stating to her, \\"Your subjects have followed the deceased emperor ever since difficult times. Now, the Son of Heaven is accepting other people's word and wants to send us out. Given that there are troubles west of the pass [(i.e., in the Guanzhong region, where the general Wang Jingchong was fostering a rebellion)], how can we, your subjects and ignore the affairs of the state? If we are not to remain, we hope to at least remain until the deceased emperor's burial.\\" Empress Dowager Li was angered, and she went to Liu Chengyou, stating to him, \\"These are the old and accomplished subjects of the state. Why are you listening to others and expelling them?\\" When Liu Chengyou blamed the matter on the chancellors in general, Li Tao took the blame by himself, and was relieved of his chancellor position. Subsequently, Yang was given an additional chancellor position, while Guo was made co-chief of staff, such that Yang became the main decision-maker, with the two Su chancellors (along with the other chancellor Dou Zhengu) no longer having real chancellor authority. In 949, after Guo suppressed the rebellion of the general Li Shouzhen, Guo declined to be honored alone for his achievements, and therefore all of the high-level officials were honored. In Su Yugui's case, he was given the title Zuo Pushe (). By winter 950, Liu Chengyou had tired of the control the senior officials had on his government, even though, under Yang's leadership, the imperial government was considered well-run, and Shi's overseeing of the capital made it safe for the public. Part of the friction came from how his close associates and relatives of the empress dowager were trying to gain power, but were being thwarted by Yang and Shi. At that time, Empress Dowager Li's younger brother Li Ye () was serving as the director of miscellaneous affairs (Ê≠¶Âæ∑‰Ωø, Wudeshi) inside the palace, but wanted to be promoted to the higher position of director of palace affairs, a desire that Liu Chengyou and Empress Dowager Li were both in concurrence with, but Yang and Shi considered inappropriate as he lacked the seniority, so they stopped his commission. Further, Hou Kuangzan () the director of imperial stables, Guo Yunming () the director of tea and wine, and Nie Wenjin () the liaison officer at the office of the chiefs of staff, were all favored by Liu Chengyou, but had long not been promoted, causing them to be resentful. When Liu Chengyou wanted to make his favorite concubine Consort Geng empress, Yang considered it too quick after the expiration of his morning period for Liu Zhiyuan, and so opposed it. When Consort Geng died, Yang opposed Liu Chengyou's wishes to have her buried with the ceremonies due an empress. Further, there was an occasion when Yang and Shi were discussing state matters with Liu Chengyou, Liu Chengyou made the comment, \\"Be careful! Do not let others get a chance to criticize you!\\" Yang responded, \\"Your Imperial Majesty should just be quiet. Your subjects are still here.\\" This led to Liu Chengyou's resentment toward them, and his close associates thereafter falsely accused Yang and the others of plotting against him. As Su resented Shi, he also incited Li Ye and the others. Liu Chengyou, thereafter, plotted with Li Ye, Nie, Hou, and Guo Yunming to kill Yang and the others. Liu Chengyou reported his plans to Empress Dowager Li, who responded, \\"How can such things be easily considered! You should discuss with the chancellors further.\\" However, Li Ye then stated, \\"The deceased Emperor had said before that the matters of the state should not be discussed with scholars. Their timidity will ruin you.\\" When Empress Dowager Li tried to speak again, Liu Chengyou responded angrily, \\"The matters of state cannot be decided in the halls of a woman!\\" On December 24, 950, as the officials were arriving at the palace for the imperial gathering, a number of soldiers appeared and killed Yang, Shi, and Wang Zhang. Subsequently, Liu Chengyou declared that they had committed treason, and stated to the chancellors and the other officials, \\"Yang Bin and the others viewed us as a young child. We finally now get to be your true lord. You should not worry!\\" He sent soldiers to arrest and kill the relatives and close associates of Yang, Shi, and Wang. As part of the post-slaughter moves, Liu Chengyou also had the families of Guo Wei and Guo's assistant Wang Jun slaughtered, and he also sent emissaries to order the executions of Guo and Wang Jun. The emissaries were arrested and turned over to Guo, however, by Empress Dowager Li's brother Li Hongyi (). Guo thereafter rebelled and marched on Daliang. Li Ye wanted to empty out of the imperial treasury to award the imperial army with money (to try to ensure their faithfulness), and when Su Yugui initially opposed, Li Ye bowed down to him, stating, \\"Lord Chancellor, for the sake of the Son of Heaven, please do not be concerned about the treasury!\\" The soldiers were rewarded thereafter. Meanwhile, Liu Chengyou, against Empress Dowager Li's advice, went out of the capital to try to encourage the imperial troops (which he put Murong Yanchao in charge of) in opposition to Guo, with the three chancellors (Su Fengji, Su Yugui, and Dou) accompanying him. After Guo's troops defeated the imperial troops, Murong fled, and the imperial troops collapsed. Liu Chengyou was killed in the confusion, and Su Fengji, Yan, and Guo Yunming committed suicide. Su Yugui and Dou fled back to Daliang, and Su Yugui initially hid but was arrested by Guo's soldiers. Guo personally met Su Yugui and Dou and comforted them, returning them to their chancellor positions. Guo, in the aftermaths, initially consulted with Empress Dowager Li and postured to make Liu Chengyou's adoptive brother (biological cousin) Liu Yun, then the military governor of Wuning Circuit (Ê≠¶ÂØß, headquartered in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu), emperor. While Liu Yun was on the way from Wuning's capital Xu Prefecture () to Daliang, however, there were reports of a major Liao incursion. Empress Dowager Li sent Guo to resist it, leaving affairs of the government to Dou, Su, and Wang Jun, and military matters to Wang Yin (), although Su was subsequently sent to Song Prefecture (ÂÆãÂ∑û, in modern Shangqiu, Henan) to welcome Liu Yun. Soon, while Guo was away from Daliang, his soldiers rose to support him as the new emperor, and he returned to Daliang to seize the throne, establishing the new state of Later Zhou.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 290.  During Later Zhou  As emperor, Guo Wei retained Dou Zhengu and Su Yugui as chancellors, and gave Su the additional honorific title of Sikong (Âè∏Á©∫, one of the Three Excellencies), but added Wang Jun as a chancellor. Not long after, though, he relieved Dou and Su of their chancellor positions, with Su remaining only as Sikong (with Fan Zhi and Li Gu made chancellors in their stead).

The last of his 11 books about secret agents and their murderous struggles with Nazis both during and after World War II, it was published by Futura in England and by St. Martin's Press in the United States, apparently the same year that O'Brine died. It is narrated by a nameless hero of Italian birth and more than one nationality, who joins the British undercover services in the early days of the war, impelled primarily by a single-minded, overriding desire to kill Germans. After months of arduous training in all parts of the British Isles, he is parachuted into the French countryside to take up the leadership of a band of a Resistance fighters. Grim and totally with humor, the rest of the book is a straightforward narrative of his brutal and merciless attacks against German targets, his eventual capture by the Gestapo in Paris, the ghastly tortures he undergoes at their hands, and his escape from their heavily guarded prison. In the final pages he makes his way south over a period of weeks to Marseille, garroting or otherwise killing dozens of German troops as he proceeds.

While he was convicted of a bond-rigging scheme, Judge Brian Cogan ordered a new trial be set for Nordlicht. He was the founder and former chief investment officer of Platinum Partners, a U.S. based hedge fund.Wall Street Journal: \\"Fraud Probe Ricochets Through Platinum Partners, a Hedge Fund With Ties to Jewish Community - Platinum Partners has reported strong returns for years but now is liquidating\\" By Rob Copeland July 25, 2016. Early life and education Nordlicht was born to a Jewish familyTaipei Times: \\"Platinum Partners executives charged with US$1bn fraud\\" December 21, 2016 and raised on Long Island.The Times of London: \\"Take spousal test to avoid a trip down denial that may end up in the clink\\" by Alexandra Frean December 21, 2016 He graduated from Yeshiva University in 1990 with a B.A. in philosophy. With $11,000 saved from his bar mitzvah he started trading commodity options. Platinum Partners Platinum Partners was formed in 2003 in New York City with Nordlicht as chief investment officer. It portrayed itself as having a knack for illiquid investments and had $1.7 billion in assets in its most recent filing. The investor mix consisted of institutional investors, family offices and ultra-high-net individuals.Platinum Partners  Arrest  On December 19, 2016, federal agents arrested Nordlicht and six others on charges related to a $1 billion fraud that alleged that Nordlicht's firm operated \\"like a Ponzi scheme,\\" according to prosecutors. The indictment charged Nordlicht and his co-defendants with eight counts of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, investment adviser fraud, securities fraud conspiracy, investment adviser fraud conspiracy, and wire fraud conspiracy for defrauding investors through overvaluation of assets, concealment of severe cash flow problems at Platinum, and the preferential payment of redemptions. Nordlicht's Platinum Partners management companies \\"projected stability and confidence\\" to current and prospective investors, reporting positive average returns of 17% from 2003 to 2015, according to a parallel civil lawsuit filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Included among the charges was manipulation of Black Elk Energy bonds. Nordlicht and the other five defendants all pleaded not guilty to the charges. A trial date of April 15, 2019 has been set. = Ties to New York City correctional officers' union = The investigation of Platinum and Nordlicht was an outgrowth of a criminal case against Norman Seabrook, the head of the New York City correctional officers' union, who was alleged to have invested $20 million of the union's pension money in Platinum as part of a scheme in which he got kickbacks. Murray Huberfeld, an executive of Platinum, reportedly gave Seabrook bribes including a Ferragamo bag stuffed with $60,000 in cash to secure a $20 million pension investment. Seabrook was also to be paid a portion of the profits from the union's investment, which Huberfeld estimated would be between $100,000 and $150,000 a year, according to the government. After a hung jury in his first trial, Seabrook was found guilty of bribery and conspiracy at a second trial in August 2018, and as a result of the ongoing case that forced Platinum to close, the correction officers' union pension fund lost $19 million dollars of its investment. Seabrook was sentenced to 58 months in prison on February 8, 2019.  Leaks in the media  Lawyers for Nordlicht argued in court and in a letter dated April 7, 2017 that an FBI agent may have leaked information about the investigation to the press before it became public. The letter cited news articles in Bloomberg, the Wall Street Journal and the New York Post published in the summer of 2016 reporting that Platinum was under investigation. Nordlicht's lawyers further argued that the leaks, and not the actions of Platinum's executives, may have been responsible for the damage to the value of Platinum's funds that caused harm to investors. The actions of Nordlicht have been defended as reflecting the difficulty of pricing futures in the energy sector, as well as the problem of leaks driving down price. In February 2017 the media outlet Newsmax reported: > The valuation of illiquid assets is frequently a topic of disagreement, > controversy, and negotiation. The Platinum value arbitrage fund had energy- > related assets whose value varied depending on the price of oil. At a > certain point, the federal government itself starting driving down the value > of Platinum's assets by leaking that the fund was under investigation. The > idea underlying the Platinum value arbitrage fund ‚Äî private equity illiquid > assets in a structure with hedge fund liquidity ‚Äî may have been too > difficult to execute successfully even absent government interference. But > having a bad investment idea, or a good idea poorly executed, doesn't > usually warrant the criminal charges and 20 years in jail that the Platinum > managers are facing. It's not supposed to be a crime to have a money-losing > hedge fund, or even one that made money for a while and then lost some. Reporter Ira Stoll of New Boston Post said of the case: > The more one looks into this, the more it looks like the Platinum Partners > prosecution is just the latest in a mounting and troubling pattern of > examples in which New York-area federal prosecutors and FBI agents have > jailed hedge fund managers or destroyed their businesses with publicized > raids ‚Äî only to have the charges eventually overturned by judges or never > brought at all.  Trial  Trial the case of USA v. Nordlicht, et. al. began on April 23, 2019 before U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan. The jury trial spanned nine weeks as defendants Mark Nordlicht and to other platinum executives invoked various defenses unveiling unruly subject matter purported by the prosecution, and can otherwise in rebuttals. The jury reached a mixed verdict on July 9, 2019. The jury rejected the prosecution's keystone argument purporting the Platinum Partners fund operated \\"like a Ponzi scheme,\\" finding all defendants not guilty on those five subject charges unanimously. The jury did find two defendants guilty on three counts relating to conspiracy and securities fraud in transactions relating to bondholders of oil exploration company Black Elk. Platinum's former CFO, Joseph SanFilippo, was exonerated and acquired of all charges in a unanimous not guilty verdict by the jury on every count. Earlier in proceedings, the judge overseeing the case nixed the government's case as to the credibility of fraud claims, finding no clear anchor of fact or evidence limiting the government's scope in prosecution on the subject charges relating to fraudulent misrepresentation or falsely inflating asset values relating to the Platinum flagship fund. After the announcement of the jury's findings in verdict, presiding Judge Brian Cogan granted the defense a request for a special motion to vacate the lesser guilty verdicts. The defense was granted by order to file motions challenging all remaining charges pertaining to the charges coinciding with the jury's guilty verdicts. In a final statement, Hon. Cogan affirmed \\"It's not over yet,\\" insinuating a likely re- examintion of subject matter related to the Black Elk guilty charges. Personal life and philanthropy Nordlicht is married.

Fagnani was the daughter of Italian-born painter Giuseppe Fagnani, who had emigrated to the United States in the company of Sir Henry Bulwer when he came to take up his post as British ambassador in 1849. He later became an American citizen and married, in 1851, Harriet Emma Everett Goodwin of Charlestown, Massachusetts. The couple took up residence in New York City, where Nina was born. Her artistic studies took place in Paris, where she worked with the widow of William Wyld, as well as with one Mme. Grec. She first exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1880, showing a Portrait of an Infant on enamel; she exhibited also at the Salons of 1890, 1895, 1896, and 1898, and in 1892 presented a work at the Royal Academy of Arts in London.

Known as \\"the restorer of Spanish surgery,\\" he was an innovator in the field of medical science. He is recognized for running the first clinical trial and for encouraging the use of anesthesia in Spain, introducing ether in 1847. Argumosa gained much of his experience and knowledge serving as a doctor during the Peninsular War at the San Rafael Hospital in Santander, Spain. In addition to his medical innovations, he was known for providing care in a famous case where the Spanish nun Sor Patrocinio claimed to suffer from stigmata. Argumosa was a member of the Progressive Party, and he was the second mayor of Madrid and the deputy for the province of Madrid in 1836 and 1837. He was appointed as the physician to Queen Isabel II, a position he never chose to accept. After the death of his family and his retirement at the age of 62, Argumosa retired to his hometown. He later died in Torrelavega, Cantabria, Spain.  Life  An 1885 painting by Antonio Bravo of the Faculty of Medicine at Santander, with Diego de Argumosa in the center Diego de Argumosa was born on 7 July 1792 in Villapresente, Cantabria, Spain. His parents were both hidalgos: Juan Antonio de Argumosa, a doctor, and Ursula Obreg√≥n. Diego studied at the Colegio de los Padres Escolapios de Villacarriedo (College of the Piarists of Villacarriedo) in Cantabria. During the Peninsular War, he joined the Third Battalion of Marksmen of Cantabria, where he worked as a doctor attending to the wounded at the Military Section of the San Rafael Hospital in Santander. He also accompanied the troops when they marched through the mountains; this deformed his feet, and caused him to limp for the rest of his life. When the war ended in 1814, Argumosa earned his bachelor's degree from the University of Alcal√°. He later enrolled in the Surgical College of San Carlos in Madrid and earned his surgical license. In 1820 he earned his doctorate with his thesis, De prognosis in febribus acutis (Prognosis of acute febrile diseases). In 1821, he began working as an interim professor in the Surgical College of Burgos, where he stayed for two years. He then returned to Madrid, where he became a professor of dissection. In addition to his work, he cared for his mother and brothers, as his father had been exiled to London for political reasons. Because he had little experience in teaching, his early classes followed the teachings of Dr. Roche, a French surgeon who wrote a book on medicine and surgery that Argumosa would later translate into Spanish in 1828. He continued until 1829, when he became the Chair of Surgery at the College of San Carlos, then later worked at the surgical clinic. During those years he married Micaela Ad√°n, the daughter of sculptor Juan Ad√°n Morl√°n, and had three children: Diego, who died when he was nine years old, and Isabel and Natalia. In around 1848, Argumosa publicly confronted Joaqu√≠n Hysern for writing a book based on his classes that he felt was incomplete and full of errors. In 1850, he published some articles in a newspaper called La Uni√≥n, in which he called professors Jos√© Mar√≠a L√≥pez and Manuel Soler \\"university prevaricators,\\" and they filed complaints against him. Argumosa was acquitted of libel charges but found guilty of making insults, and sentenced to two years of exile, a fine of 100 duros, and suspension of his office and political rights during the sentence. After the rapid and closely timed deaths of his two daughters, Arugmosa retired on January 27, 1854 to Villapresente. Argumosa died in Torrelavega on April 23, 1865.  Innovations  Surgical instruments used by Diego de Argumosa. The illustration accompanied Argumosa's Resumen de Cirug√≠a, and was created by his daughter Natalia. Argumosa introduced ether-induced anesthesia to Spain on 13 January 1847, only three months after John Collins Warren and William T. G. Morton first demonstrated its use in Boston, and only months after it was tested by Fran√ßois Magendie at the Paris Academy of Medicine. He attached a cow's bladder containing one ounce of ether to the patient's mouth with a metal cannula, which they would breathe. Afterwards, he also used chloroform to anesthetize the patient. Argumosa also developed new surgical techniques, and improved upon existing surgical practices. He changed the position of the patient during surgery, operating on them when they were lying down instead of the seated position that was generally used, so that they could better withstand the pain of the procedure. He developed new techniques to amputate the thigh and the anal fistula, which he described in his monographs. He invented the \\"basted suture,\\" which he used to treat aneurysms. He also was among the first to practice phlebotomy, suturing the tear in a vein. He developed an intestinal suture that could be naturally expelled from the channel through which it was placed, which did not necessitate the laparotomic incision that was previously required for suture removal. Some of his innovations were in the field of general medicine: he was an early practitioner of asepsis, taking exceptional care to clean his hands, instruments, and the operating room. He isolated patients while they were undergoing surgery, instead of operating in a room with other patients. He was also an innovator in the field of otorhinolaryngology. He developed the blepharoplasty technique to remove tumors in the lower eyelid, cancers of the cheekbone, and to treat the loss of the outer part of the eyelids. He developed the cheiloplasty technique to treat lip cancers. He improved the rhinoplasty technique. He also developed the syringotome, a special type of scalpel. Among his developments in urology were his technique to puncture the bladder (cytotomy), various methods of removing urinary calculi, external and internal urethrotomies, the subcutaneous ligation of varicocele veins using the fisherman's knot, and genital operations. Argumosa also contributed to the field of arthrology, although it was his students who developed upon his work. He founded a school that was continued by two of his primary students: Juan Creus, a forefather of taurotraumatology (bullfighting injuries), and Melchor S√°nchez de Toca. In 1854, he retired to Torrelavega to write Resumen de Cirug√≠a (Summary of Surgery), which was published in 1856. The work described the general knowledge of surgery at that time and all of his innovations, and was accompanied by illustrations and descriptions of the surgical instruments that he had created for his procedures.  Sor Patrocinio's stigmata  Sor Patrocinio In 1830, Spanish nun Sor Patrocinio claimed to be afflicted with stigmata, which appeared on her hands, feet, and side. Her fame spread quickly, and before she turned 25 she was considered a living saint. Religious people flocked to the convent where she lived: common people, aristocrats, and courtesans of Queen Isabel II and her husband Francis, Duke of C√°diz. In 1835, Argumosa was one of the doctors tasked with studying the nun's stigmata. They disinfected and treated the wounds, and in less than three weeks all were healed and the nun was discharged from their care. The nun was banished to Talavera de la Reina. Despite the fact that both religious and civil authorities agreed with the decision that the stigmata were fraudulent, some did not accept Argumosa's diagnosis. However, during the case, a friar confessed that, while traveling with him to Rome to found new convents, the nun had given him a sachet containing a substance that would cause a small ulcer when applied to the body.

History  Deportivo Hualgayoc was founded in 1992 in Hualgayoc, Cajamarca by local businessmen and farmers. The team was very successful at a local level where it was either the district's champion or runner-up from 1992 to 1997. It reached the Provincial Stage for the first time in 1996. For financial reasons the club stopped competing after the 1997 season. In 2014, Napole√≥n Gil G√°lvez, who was the club's first treasurer and now the current club president, became the mayor of Hualgayoc and promised to bring professional football to the district. The club came back to competition led by Erick Torres in 2015 when it won the district and provincial tournaments in Hualgayoc. It became champion of the Departamental Stage to reach the Copa Per√∫ national stage for the first time in its history. The club won the first leg against Cristal Tumbes 2‚Äì0 but lost 0‚Äì5 on the second leg and was eliminated from the tournament. In 2016 with Torres still as coach it started its campaign from the Provincial Stage because of the previous year's performance. Deportivo Hualgayoc once more won both the Provincial and Departamental Stages to reach the National Stage for the second consecutive time in its history. The club reached La Final√≠sima or Final group stage after defeating Club Jos√© Mar√≠a Arguedas and EGB Tacna Heroica in the Round of 16 and quarterfinals respectively. Hualgayoc tied its first game against the eventual winner Sport Rosario 1‚Äì1 and then surprisingly defeated Racing de Huamanchuco by 4‚Äì1 to reach the last match date as the favorite to win the tournament. The club unfortunately lost against Binacional 0‚Äì1 and finished the tournament as runner-up after Sport Rosario defeated Racing de Huamanchuco 2‚Äì1 and thus gained the right to play in the 2017 Peruvian Segunda Divisi√≥n.  Colours and badge  Deportivo Hualgayoc's colours are blue for its home games and white with blue borders for its away games. The word \\"Hualgayoc\\" can usually be seeing in caps on the front side of the T-shirt. Deportivo Hualgayoc's badge is the coat of arms of the Hualgayoc District which is an Andean condor as the single supporter wearing a crown with an escutcheon divided in three quarters superimposed in itself with a classic telstar pattern ball on its feet on a blue escutcheon with the initials \\"CSCD\\" on top and the word \\"Hualgayoc\\" on bottom.  Stadium  Deportivo Hualgayoc plays their home matches at Estadio Jos√© G√°lvez Eg√∫squiza in Hualgayoc, Cajamarca. The stadium is named in honor of the Peruvian war hero from the Battle of Callao.

Hawley and her sister, Mary Foote ‚Äì also later to become a painter ‚Äì were born in Guilford, Connecticut, the daughters of Charles Spencer Foote (1837‚Äì1880) and Hannah Hubbard Foote (1840‚Äì1885).Daughters of the American Revolution. Lineage Book ‚Äì National Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution. Orphaned at five, she was adopted by her aunt, Harriet Foote Hawley, and uncle, Joseph Roswell Hawley. Joseph was a member of the United States Senate, and Margaret went to live with the couple in Washington, D.C. There she attended public schools and the Corcoran School of Art, where she was awarded a gold medal for her life drawing. She also took private lessons with Howard Helmick, and received instruction from William Merritt Chase.https://generalandrewwardcemeteryassoc.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/margaret-1.pdf After graduation she taught at a girls' boarding school, saving up enough money to go to Paris and spend two summers at the Acad√©mie Colarossi. She received training in the creation of full-scale portraits, but soon found that she preferred the challenge of working in miniature. Almost immediately upon the start of her career Hawley began to receive awards. Throughout her career, these included a medal of honor from the Pennsylvania Society of Miniature Painters (1918); the Lea Prize from the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (1920); the Smith Memorial Prize of the Baltimore Watercolor Club (1925); a bronze medal at the Sesquicentennial Exposition in Philadelphia (1926); a medal of honor from the Brooklyn Society of Miniature Painters (1931); and a medal for best miniature from the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors (1931). She was elected president of the American Society of Miniature Painters in 1923, and was a regular fixture of its annual exhibits. She showed work in London from 1926 until 1929, and was elected in 1927 to the Royal Miniature Society. From 1920 to 1963 she was a member of the Cosmopolitan Club. Some four hundred miniatures by Hawley are known. Many are in private collections; among museums which hold her paintings are the Metropolitan Museum of Art (the arachnologist Alexander Petrunkevitch), the National Museum of American Art, the Brooklyn Museum, the Wadsworth Atheneum, and the Stowe-Day Foundation in Hartford. Her 1927 portrait of Natalie Shipman was included in the inaugural exhibition of the National Museum of Women in the Arts, American Women Artists 1830‚Äì1930, in 1987. Hawley died in Midtown Hospital in New York City, in which city she had kept a studio for many years; she had another studio in Boston. Her only listed survivors were her sister and two stepsisters. She is buried in the Foote-Ward Cemetery in Guilford, Connecticut.

History Diplomatic relations between India and Venezuela were established on 1 October 1959. India maintains an embassy in Caracas, while Venezuela maintains an embassy in New Delhi. There have been several visits by heads of state and government, and other high-level officials between the countries. President Hugo Ch√°vez visited New Delhi on 4‚Äì7 March 2005. Ch√°vez met with Indian President APJ Abdul Kalam and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. The two countries signed six agreements including one to establish a Joint Commission to promote bilateral relations and another on cooperation in the hydrocarbon sector. Foreign Minister Nicol√°s Maduro visited India to attend the First Meeting of the India-CELAC Troika Foreign Ministers meeting in New Delhi on 7 August 2012. The Election Commission of India (ECI) and the National Electoral Council (CNE) of Venezuela signed an MoU during a visit by Indian Election Commissioner V S Sampath to Caracas in 2012. Minister of State for Corporate Affairs visited Venezuela to attend the state funeral of President Chavez in March 2013. The President and Prime Minister of India expressed condolences on the death of Ch√°vez. The Rajya Sabha, the upper house of Parliament, observed a minute's silence to mark his death. Ambassador Smita Purushottam represented India at the swearing-in ceremony of Ch√°vez's successor Nicol√°s Maduro on 19 April 2013. Citizens of Venezuela are eligible for scholarships under the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation Programme and the Indian Council for Cultural Relations. Economic relations =Trade= India surpassed China as the largest Asian importer of crude oil from Venezuela in 2012. Venezuela is India's fourth largest source of crude oil after Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Iran accounting for 12% of the country's oil imports in April‚ÄìNovember 2018. In the preceding decade, India became the third largest importer of oil in the world, after the United States and China. Following unrest in West Asia, its traditional source of oil, India looked to diversify its sources of oil imports. The rise in US domestic oil production resulted in a 49% reduction of American oil imports from Venezuela in 2014, creating an opportunity for India to increase crude oil imports from Venezuela. As crude oil imports form the bulk of bilateral trade, the total value of trade is heavily dependent on crude oil prices. Bilateral trade between India and Venezuela totalled US$5.83 billion in 2015‚Äì16. This was much lower than the $14.46 billion, $14.22 billion and $11.99 billion recorded in 2012‚Äì13, 2013‚Äì14 and 2014‚Äì15 respectively. In 2015‚Äì16, crude oil exports from Venezuela to India stood at $5.68 billion, while non-oil exports from Venezuela accounted for just $23.18 million. Apart from crude oil, the other major commodities India imports from Venezuela are iron pellets and electrical cables. India's total exports to Venezuela in 2015‚Äì16 totaled $130.66 million, declining from $258.07 million the previous fiscal. The main commodities exported by India to Venezuela are pharmaceuticals, chemicals, textiles, calcined petroleum coke (CPC), engineering products such as scooters, equipment and machinery. =Hydrocarbons= Venezuelan President Nicol√°s Maduro, ONGC Executive Director Narendra Kumar Verma, and PDVSA President Eulogio Del Pino in Caracas; November 2016. According to Rejaul Karim Laskar, a scholar of India'a foreign policy, the most important aspect of India‚ÄìVenezuela relations relates to hydrocarbons. Venezuela has world's largest reserve of crude oil, while India is world's third largest importer of crude oil. During President Ch√°vez's visit to India in March 2005, the two countries signed a bilateral agreement on co-operation in the hydrocarbon sector and an MoU granting ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL) rights for oil and gas exploration in Venezuela. OVL subsequently opened an office in Venezuela. In April 2008, OVL and PDVSA established a joint venture called Petrolera IndoVenezolana SA for exploration and production oil in the San Crist√≥bal field. OVL has a 40% stake in the company and the remaining 60% is held by PDVSA. OVL helped certify heavy oil reserves in the Orinoco river belt in 2010. In February 2010, an international consortium including Indian state-owned oil companies won a global bid to claim 40% stake worth $1.05 billion in the Carabobo-1 oil field, giving India the capability to produce 400,000 barrels of crude oil per day. Three Indian firms - OVL, Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Oil India Ltd (OIL) - are part of the consortium, along with Repsol of Spain and Petronas of Malaysia. The three Indian firms own a combined 18% stake in the Carinobo oil field. India is among the few countries with the capability to refine Venezuelan crude oil. Venezuelan crude oil requires special processing because of its inferior quality compared to Middle Eastern crude oil as the former is heavier and contains more sulfur. Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) secured a 15-year crude supply contract with PDVSA to import 400,000 barrels of oil per day, for processing at its twin refineries at Jamnagar, Gujarat. Essar is another major importer of oil from Venezuela. India and Venezuela signed an agreement to double production at the San Crist√≥bal oil field in November 2016. =Pharmaceuticals= Several Indian pharmaceutical firms such as Sun Pharma, Dr Reddy's Laboratories, Glenmark, Claris, and Cipla operate in Venezuela. Cipla has 120 medications approved to market in Venezuela as of 2013, and made nearly $15 million in revenue the year 2006. Half of all HIV patients in Venezuela used at least one Cipla drug in 2006. Indian pharmaceutical firms have been able to take advantage of the severe shortage of basic medicines in Venezuela, which the Venezuelan Pharmaceutical Federation estimated to be around 70%. Indian firms exported $140 million worth of medicines to Venezuela in 2014‚Äì15. The Venezuelan market is so important to Indian firms that domestic politics can affect their share prices. For instance, shares of Glenmark and Dr Reddy's fell by 5% and 2% respectively following the 2015 general elections and the expectation of currency devaluation in Venezuela. Due to currency controls placed on the economy by the Venezuelan government, Indian firms have been unable to repatriate revenue from their Venezuelan subsidiaries since 2013. Dr Reddy's Laboratories had to write-off $64.7 million in the fourth quarter of FY16 due to currency restrictions placed by the Venezuelan government, and the company was only permitted to repatriate $4 million in that quarter. Cultural relations The National Assembly of Venezuela passed a unanimous resolution in honour of Sathya Sai Baba following his death. Indian Ambassador to Venezuela Rajiv Kumar Nagpal is the current Indian Ambassador to Venezuela. Indians in Venezuela As of July 2016, there are about 50 Indian families living Venezuela, of which about 35 reside in Caracas. The Indian Association of Venezuela, which was dormant since 1997, and revived in 2003, organises celebrations for Indian festivals such as Deepavali and Holi for members of the Indian community as well as Venezuelans. Most of the Indian community are businessmen, employees of oil companies, and professionals.

He was one of the founders of the New Zealand Cricket Council in 1894. Life and business career Born in Sydney, Smith joined the Alliance Assurance Company as a young man in Australia. He took up the position as the company's manager in Napier, New Zealand, in 1890, before becoming manager in Christchurch in 1892, in Dunedin in 1897, and in Wellington in 1900. He became general manager for New Zealand in 1916, residing in the Wellington suburb of Wadestown. In March 1920 he took six months leave of absence in the hope that a trip to California would assist his failing health. However, his health gave way on the trip and he returned having only reached Honolulu, and died soon after his return to Auckland in May. He was survived by his wife, Alice. They had no children. Cricket playing career A left-arm spin bowler, Smith varied his pace subtly and was able to move the ball either way off the pitch. In his four first-class matches for Hawke's Bay he took 33 wickets at an average of 5.81, with a strike rate of a wicket every 15 deliveries. In his first match, against Taranaki in January 1892, he bowled only in the first innings, taking 4 for 9 off seven five-ball overs. In his second match, three months later, he bowled unchanged throughout both of Taranaki's innings, taking 13 wickets for 33 (7 for 20 and 6 for 13) off 21.5 five-ball overs. Hawke's Bay won both matches easily. With 17 wickets at an average of 2.47, Smith was the leading bowler in the short New Zealand first-class season. In 1892-93 he played two matches which Hawke's Bay lost against stronger opposition. Against Wellington in November 1892 he took 3 for 25 and 6 for 60 off a total of 35.1 six-ball overs. In December, against Otago, he took 7 for 65 off 28 five-ball overs in an innings defeat. An Otago reporter described Smith as ‚Äúas good a bowler as Otago has met for some years‚Äù. Cricket administrative career After moving to Christchurch he joined the Lancaster Park club, where he served as honorary treasurer and topped the bowling in 1893-94 with an average of 7. He also topped the club's bowling in 1895-96, again with an average of 7. He served on the committee of the Canterbury Cricket Association. In December 1894, as a delegate from Hawke's Bay, he attended the conference in Christchurch at which the New Zealand Cricket Council was formed. He was elected honorary secretary of the Council, and served in that position from 1894-95 to 1896-97.Greg Ryan, Where the Game Was Played by Decent Chaps, PhD thesis, University of Canterbury, 1996, p. 330. He was the main New Zealand negotiator in getting the New South Wales cricket team to tour New Zealand in 1895-96. When the Australian team visited in November 1896 he travelled with the team through New Zealand. At the time he expressed the hope that New Zealand players would in future be included in Australian teams to tour England. The headquarters of the NZCC being in Christchurch, Smith resigned from his position on the Council in late 1897 when he moved to Dunedin. The 1898 annual report of the NZCC stated: ‚ÄúThose who had watched the advancement of the Council from its initiation would know it was mainly, and perhaps entirely, through Mr Smith‚Äôs efforts that the Council had done such good work, and was in such a flourishing condition.‚Äù Smith played for the Carisbrook club in Dunedin. In 1897-98 he was the third-highest wicket-taker in the competition, with 47 wickets at 12.9. He served as honorary secretary of the Otago Cricket Association. During the Boer War he was honorary secretary of the Otago Patriotic Fund Committee.

The album, named after the former name of the band, and featuring a cover illustration resembling an old story book drawing by Francisco Messeguer, was recorded from June 2013 to December 2014 and released on 1 July 2015. It was produced, mixed and mastered by the band's keyboardist Eduardo Marin√© and released in 2015 on digital stores. The Conspiracy Chronicles narrates diverse aspects of a dystopian society with a manipulative and controlling government. Though the album does not narrate a story, each song explore the concepts of loss of humanity caused by technological advances, society's apathy towards government, loss of faith, and human transcendence through art.  Background  In 2009, the band changed their name to Tangerine Circus and began to work on their first songs. Those songs would later on become their debut album Urania. During 2010, composition began for their sophomore album, The Conspiracy Chronicles. In order to pursue this new material, the band began the search for a fifth member, a full-time singer, but with little success. In 2012, with Naoki Sasamoto on lead vocals, the band began recording the first version of The Conspiracy Chronicles, but due to low budget and rush of the process, it ended up being a demo for the upcoming final version recorded a couple of years later. Finally, Sasamoto left the band late 2012, leading to all original members taking over vocal duties, each one of them performing lead vocals on different songs.  Recording  In early 2013, Marin√© proposed that their two first musical efforts were re-recorded in his newly founded studio, LM Studio. With the band self-producing its own work and Marin√© being in charge of engineering and mixing, Tangerine Circus reached a new level of control and detail with their work. It took them almost a year and a half to re-record and re-arrange their existing material into their final forms. \\"Advent of the Thinking\\", which was originally left out due to time constraints, was revisited by Messeguer and Marin√©, being recorded and making into the final version of the album. Through the recording process, the songs were revisited in their entirety by adding new vocal harmonies, textures and slightly modifying the existing structures of the songs. The recording process was completely digital, using amplifier simulators and sampling. Guitars were recorded through a GT-100 Roland module, while for bass and AmpliTube digital module was used. Different keyboards were used during the record of the album, such as Spectrasonics' Omnisphere, Native Instruments, Roland Fantom G8 synthesizer, among others. Drums were recorded with an RMV kit, and a wide variety of Slate Digital triggers.  Release  The Conspiracy Chronicles was first released digitally on streaming services and digital stores on 1 July 2015.https://itunes.apple.com/mx/album/the-conspiracy- chronicles/id1016810244?l=en = Packaging = In 2016, the album, along with Urania, was released as a two-disc set as a less expensive presentation to introduce their debut works to the public. The cover art of this set consists on Tangerine Circus's logo over a black background.  Live performances  Although there was never an official tour of the album, the band gigged in Mexico City to promote the album. They played dates in State of Mexico and Quer√©taro, promoting also their debut release Urania. The Conspiracy Chronicles was played in its entirety for the first time on 14 October 2016, at Metal Brothers in Mexico City.

Early history  UFO sightings were recorded in the Thailand Chronicles \\"C·∫°kr K√¶ÃÇw\\" (; Crystal Chakram) during the reign of King Lithai (‡∏û‡∏ç‡∏≤‡∏•‡∏¥‡πÑ‡∏ó; 1347‚Äì68) of the Sukhothai Kingdom. The UFO was identified as a \\"flying weapon\\" that helped the Thai king win in battle.  20th century  Dr. Debhanom Muangman, the former dean of the Faculty of Public Health at Mahidol University and a Harvard University alumni, claimed extraterrestrial contact after a ‚ÄúGrey‚Äù came into his bedroom in Si Yan, Bangkok. In the 1950s, he studied in the United States, and he claimed to have seen a flying saucer in the sky over New Hampshire. He continues to study paranormal phenomena, including ghosts, spirits, psychic experiences and reincarnation. He is currently the president of the Thailand Association for Psychological Research (‡∏™‡∏°‡∏≤‡∏Ñ‡∏°‡∏Ñ‡πâ‡∏ô‡∏Ñ‡∏ß‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ó‡∏≤‡∏á‡∏à‡∏¥‡∏ï‡πÅ‡∏´‡πà‡∏á‡∏õ‡∏£‡∏∞‡πÄ‡∏ó‡∏®‡πÑ‡∏ó‡∏¢). He claims that in a previous life he was born on Mars and was named \\"Peerati\\". Through his contact with aliens using telepathy through meditation, he claims that the extraterrestrials friendly with him were named \\"Eddie\\" of the Pluto people, and \\"Parasital\\" of the Mars people. In addition, there was a group in Nakhon Sawan province, who called themselves the \\"Khao Kala Group\\" (‡∏Å‡∏•‡∏∏‡πà‡∏°‡πÄ‡∏Ç‡∏≤‡∏Å‡∏∞‡∏•‡∏≤). Khao Kala is the low mountain in the area of Ban Pu Ta Ching, Phra Non sub-district, Mueang Nakhon Sawan district which overlaps Khao Kala sub-district in Phayuha Khiri District. They believe this place to be the stargate. This group was gathered in early December 1997 by Sergeant major Cherd Chuensamnaun (‡∏à‡πà‡∏≤‡∏™‡∏¥‡∏ö‡πÄ‡∏≠‡∏Å ‡πÄ‡∏ä‡∏¥‡∏î ‡∏ä‡∏∑‡πà‡∏ô‡∏™‡∏≥‡∏ô‡∏ß‡∏ô), a retired military man. He claimed to be in contact with extraterrestrials via meditating, but he died in 2000. His daughters continued, led by Somjit Raepeth (‡∏™‡∏°‡∏à‡∏¥‡∏ï‡∏£ ‡πÅ‡∏£‡πà‡πÄ‡∏û‡∏ä‡∏£). They contacted Dr. Muangman in the 2nd seminar of the Thailand Association for Psychological Research held at Ramkhamhaeng University in mid-December 1997. The seminars have been held every year since 1996 and claimed to have contacted UFOs or aliens periodically, such as contacting UFO that appeared over the sky of Singburi province on January 3, 1998, which was observed by thousands of people. As for Somjit, she had worked as a nurse before. At first, she didn't believe in UFOs or aliens. But she changed her attitude after she claimed to have seen a UFO floating over her house, as her father indicated previously. After that, she quit her job to devote herself to this particular matter. Since then, they have used Khao Kala as a center for contact with aliens via meditation or dharma practice in Buddhism style. There are many participants in the activity, both locals and outsiders. Consequently this place has become known as Thailand‚Äôs UFO sighting spot or Thailand's Area 51.

This seminar was based on the 20th and involved contact with aliens via Dr. Muangman's mobile phone. The communicative voice appeared as that of a woman speaking a language that could not be understood. Another woman's voice, which Dr. Muangman claimed to be the voice of an alien, was acting as an interpreter and translator in the alien group. This issue became a contentious matter in Thai society. Many people were skeptical and expressed suspicion. In mid-August 2019, a news report stated that a message was received at Khao Kala Meditation Center, Khao Kala, coming from people on Pluto. This news caused widespread criticism as being unreliable and many believe it to be a scam, even Dr. Muangman himself. The medium claims that people of Pluto conveyed a message warning of a disaster in the near future. This saga took a new turn when dozens of policemen and rangers rushed Khao Kala mountain to determine whether the Khao Kala Meditation Center, run by a group of UFO believers, was encroaching on the forest area. Police also issued a summons for Charoen Raepeth (‡πÄ‡∏à‡∏£‡∏¥‡∏ç ‡πÅ‡∏£‡πà‡πÄ‡∏û‡∏ä‡∏£), the landowners of the meditation center. The Khao Kala sub-district headman, said that most people living in the area are not UFO or alien believers, and that most of the followers are from out-of-town. According to the opinions of a theologian from Silpakorn University, this issue is based on a combination of beliefs in ghosts, god, aliens and Buddhism combined.Soidokmak Sukkhatant, ‡πÄ‡∏°‡∏∑‡πà‡∏≠ '‡∏°‡∏ô‡∏∏‡∏©‡∏¢‡πå‡∏ï‡πà‡∏≤‡∏á‡∏î‡∏≤‡∏ß' ‡πÄ‡∏ö‡∏µ‡πâ‡∏¢‡∏ß‡∏ô‡∏±‡∏î ‡∏Ñ‡∏∏‡∏¢‡∏ô‡∏±‡∏Å‡∏î‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏®‡∏≤‡∏™‡∏ï‡∏£‡πå ‡πÉ‡∏ô‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏ô‡∏ó‡∏µ‡πà '‡∏ú‡∏µ ‡πÄ‡∏ó‡∏û ‡∏û‡∏∏‡∏ó‡∏ò' ‡∏£‡πà‡∏ß‡∏°‡πÅ‡∏à‡∏° (When alien not showing up, talk astronomer on the day that 'ghost deity Buddhism' joins), Matichon, Vol. 42 Issue 15, 137 (Wednesday 21st August 2019) References Thailand Events in Thailand ","title":"UFO sightings in Thailand"},{"id":"52804747","text":"The 1950 New Mexico gubernatorial election took place on November 7, 1950, in order to elect the Governor of New Mexico.

It is endemic to the upper Sepik River basin in the northern side of the New Guinea Highlands in Papua New Guinea. The specific name grylloides, from Latin gryllus (\\"cricket\\") and Greek suffix -oides (\\"resembles\\"), alludes to its cricket-like, high-pitched advertisement call. Description This species is only known from two specimens: the holotype, an adult male, and other specimen that is tentatively (short of call or genetic data) assigned to this species. The holotype measures in snout‚Äìvent length, the other specimen is slightly smaller. The head is relatively narrow. The snout is slender with a rounded tip. The eyes are moderately small. The tympanic annulus is indistinct. All but the first finger have distinctly expanded discs. All toes have expanded terminal discs. Webbing is absent. Skin of the upper surfaces bear scattered low, rounded tubercules; the venter is smooth. The holotype, as seen at night, had black dorsal medial area, grading laterally to medium brown, and contrasting with the orangish-brown snout, thighs, and posterior of the dorsum. The flanks and limbs had extensive scattered pale grey-blue spots. The male advertisement call is high-pitched, with dominant frequency of 4845‚Äì5115 Hz, giving it a cricket-like sound. Calls consist of 4‚Äì5 pulsed notes, the last of which has many more pulses than the previous notes. Habitat and conservation Choerophryne grylloides is known from primary foothill rainforest at elevations of above sea level. The holotype was calling at night from the exposed surface of a leaf, about above the ground. Given the availability of suitable habitat, this species has probably a broad distribution along the northern slopes of the New Guinea Highlands. As of late 2019, it has not been assessed for the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

Life and career According to Who Was Who in America, Pell was born in St. Louis. Claiborne Pell believed that she was a great-niece of his great-great-grandfather, William Ferris Pell, and she was also related to the Folger family. She studied at the Design School for Women at Cooper Union under William Rimmer, graduating in 1870 and creating a sculpture of Puck which won praise from the New York Evening Post. An 1872 mention in the Daily Evening Transcript indicates that she was summering in Vermont at Bread Loaf Mountain, and describes her as a \\"sculptress\\". She and sister and brother-in- law, Evelyn and Charles H. Todd, soon traveled to Europe, North Africa, and the Near East, a trip during which she painted constantly and illustrated a manuscript by Charles Todd on biblical subjects. By the 1880s she was living in New York City, exhibiting at the National Academy of Design. 1889 and 1890 found her showing at the Paris Salon, listing her teachers as Jean-Paul Laurens, Jacques Fernand Humbert, and Gaston Casimir Saint-Pierre. By later in the 1890s she was living in New York City, creating work for reproduction by Louis Prang and illustrating books, including Through the Invisible by Paul Tyner. She also exhibited work as a medalist. She continued summering in the Catskills with her family, and gave an address in Fishkill-on-the-Hudson, New York when exhibiting. She served at various times as the vice-president of the Ladies' Art Association and as president of the Liberal Art League, both in New York City. Pell died in Beacon, New York, a year after her sister, and was buried near the latter in an unmarked grave in the Fishkill Rural Cemetery. Fifty-eight paintings were deposited at the Museum of Fort Ticonderoga along with drawings, diaries, and other memorabilia. Another painting is in the Columbus Museum of Art. As of 1990 none of her sculpture, including an 1872 depiction of Cordelia with Lear and a heroic statue of Andromeda, was known to have survived. Pell's Salome of 1890, which was shown at the Salon, was included in the inaugural exhibition of the National Museum of Women in the Arts, American Women Artists 1830‚Äì1930, in 1987.

The band's original lineup was Ally Einbinder (bass guitar), Phoebe Harris (guitar), Abby Weems (guitar, lead vocals), and Victoria Mandanas (drums). Following Harris's (and later Ali Donohue's) departure, Potty Mouth has continued as a three-piece, with occasional guest guitarists at live performances.  History  Potty Mouth was formed by Ally Einbinder and Phoebe Harris, two Smith College students, in 2011. Einbinder played bass while Harris learned to play the guitar. Another Smith College student, Victoria Mandanas, joined the band to play drums, having played in a punk rock band in high school; Abby Weems, a high school student at the time, also joined to play guitar and sing lead vocals. Like Harris, Weems did not know how to play guitar before joining Potty Mouth. In September 2011, the band recorded four demo tracks. According to Einbinder, Harris thought of the band's name while on the toilet, unaware of the Bratmobile album of the same name. In 2013, Potty Mouth released their first full-length album, Hell Bent, to positive reviews from critics. In 2015, they released a self-titled EP, which was recorded without Harris, who had departed from the band. The band's tour to promote the EP featured various guest rhythm guitarists. During this time, they made a distribution deal with Alternative Distribution Alliance and gained attention from Atlantic Records. The band continued to tour in 2016, supporting Beach Slang's spring tour. For their 2016 shows, Potty Mouth was joined by guitarist Aurore Ounjian of Mean Creek. In July, the band played at Lollapalooza, their first music festival. Potty Mouth's second album, SNAFU, was released on March 1, 2019, preceded by two singles: \\"22\\" in January and \\"Starry Eyes\\" in February. The album received significant praise from the critics. Pitchfork's Nina Corcoran awarded the album a 7.2 rating and labelled it, \\"an arena-sized follow up that sounds like a major-label effort without all the compromises.\\" Writing for i-D, Nick Fulton called it \\"a career- defining moment for the Massachusetts band.\\"  Style  Einbinder and Weems have expressed disapproval of the labeling of the band as riot grrrl. Einbinder stated that \\"Slapping the riot grrrl label on us just because we happen to be women playing a type of music that happens to be reminiscent of another era in time seems like a lazy conflation.\\" Weems speculated that the association may have been due to the low fidelity of their early recordings. In a Pitchfork review of Hell Bent, Jenn Pelly described Weems's vocals as a \\"Liz Phair-style monotone\\", delivering \\"deceptively simple lyrics\\". Writing for the Toronto Star, Ben Rayner wrote that Weems \\"sounds like she's perpetually rolling her eyes at everything and everyone in scorn\\". Jenn Pelly and Liz Pelly also compare the band's sound to pop-punk and post-punk with vestiges of surf music.

The film was shot in Iqaluit, Nunavut, which provided its title. It is about a Quebec woman (Croze) who travels to Northern Canada after her husband (Papineau) is seriously injured. She uncovers the secret relationships he had with the Inuit community, and becomes acquainted with an Inuit man (Ungalaaq) struggling with a related family crisis. Pilon conceived of the story and planned the execution for years, though the travel and shooting conditions provided challenges. The film screened in a few film festivals before a general release. Iqaluit received some positive coverage in the Quebec press and favorable reactions from Nunavut viewers. Plot Gilles is a French Canadian working in Nunavut while his wife, Carmen, lives in Montreal and leads a career in marketing. Word reaches Carmen that Gilles has suffered a head injury, and she travels north for the first time to see him. She has never been to the north to visit Gilles at work. At the hospital, she sees him die, and the authorities plan an autopsy since the cause of death is uncertain. Carmen meets with the RCMP and learns that they are not actively investigating Gilles' death. Although she was planning to leave Iqaluit with her husband's body she changes her mind and decides to stay. Carmen meets an Inuit man, Noah, who worked with Gilles and regarded him as a good friend. While packing her husband's belongings she finds that Gilles had accumulated a collection of carvings. Carmen notices Noah's 20-year-old niece Ani, and his grown son Dany, and discovers Gilles had an affair with Ani. They had a son, Simigaq, though Carmen and Gilles never had any children. The affair ended after the birth of the child, with Gilles offering financial support and buying Noah's carvings to help the family. Carmen confides in Noah at the local bar, with Noah explaining he adopted Ani to rescue her from her abusive father. Carmen expresses her sorrow and anger at Gilles, after which Noah takes her to a remote fishing site. There, he sets up a tent and fishes, but admits he has little knowledge of Inuit hunting customs, as he was placed in a residential school as a boy. Noah's family arrive at the site in a state of panic, telling him Dany has abducted Ani and Simigaq, and gone into the wilderness, armed with a rifle. Wary of involving the RCMP, Noah believes he can reason with Dany, and Carmen insists on accompanying him. When Noah and Carmen find Dany and Ani, Dany asserts he can live on the land and evade the authorities. Carmen asks him what he did to Gilles, with Dany replying Gilles' death was an accident, but the police would never believe him. As the situation begins to de-escalate, Carmen speaks to Ani, who witnessed Gilles' death. Dany was pressing Gilles for money before accusing him and other whites of coming to the Arctic and seducing local women, including Ani. The argument led to shoving, during which Gilles tripped and fell over a cliff. After the situation with Dany is defused, the group takes their two boats back to the mainland, with Carmen asking Ani if Simigaq will ever know about Gilles. Ani replies she and everyone in the community will tell Simigaq about Gilles.

Pilon stated his 2008 film The Necessities of Life gave him the curiosity to learn more about and capture the town of Iqaluit. A budget of $4.5 million was assembled with help from Telefilm Canada and Bell Media. Pilon announced the casting of Marie-Jos√©e Croze in summer 2015, with the cast also featuring Inuit actor Natar Ungalaaq, whom Pilon had previously worked with on The Necessities of Life. Ungalaaq accepted the role, saying \\"the director ... really believed I could play that role and I accepted that as a fact\\". Christine Tootoo was a novice actress from Rankin Inlet. Filming began in Iqaluit on 20 August 2015, with 30 crew members from Montreal and 20 Inuit crew members. Moving the 10 tons of film equipment posed great obstacles, travel and accommodation costs were anticipated to be high, and temperatures during production were expected to be volatile. Plans were to film in Northern Canada for 26 days and in Montreal for one day. During production, Daniel Justice, leader of First Nations and Indigenous Studies in the University of British Columbia, complained about a Facebook post from Iqaluit resident and crew member Pascale Arpin, seeking fellow-Iqaluit residents to eat a seal for the film. The concern was that this amounted to cultural exploitation. Release At the start of filming, Entertainment One planned to distribute the film in Canada in 2016, with Seville International having international rights. The film opened in Quebec on 10 March 2017. In Nunavut, it debuted at Iqaluit's Astro Theatre on 19 April. The film played in Filmfest Hamburg in October 2016. Iqaluit also competed for Best Film at the American Indian Film Festival in 2016. Reception Marie-Jos√©e Croze received some positive reviews for her performance. Justine Smith gave the film three stars in The Montreal Gazette, crediting Pilon for showing Northern Canada naturally as well as symbolically, and remarking on the \\"differing but complementary styles\\" of Croze and Ungalaaq. In La Presse, Marc-Andr√© Lussier gave it film three stars, saying the town of Iqaluit becomes a character in the story, heightened by Robert Marcel Lepage's music but undermined by the writing, and complimented Ungalaaq and Croze. La Presse critic Yves Bergeras highlighted Ungalaq and the cinematography of Michel La Veaux. The audience in Iqaluit enjoyed the film and asked Pilon, who attended the premiere, for a sequel. At the 6th Canadian Screen Awards, Ungalaaq received a nomination for Best Supporting Actor. At the 20th Quebec Cinema Awards, La Veaux also received a nomination for Best Cinematography.

She was the longtime chair of the home economics program at the University of California. Her program was strongly grounded in science, and students admitted into the program were required to have a level of science education that was not typical of home economics programs at the time. Morgan was one of the earliest married female college professors in the United States. A graduate of the University of Chicago, Morgan held brief teaching appointments at smaller schools before earning a doctorate and taking the position at Berkeley. Morgan's lab conducted significant research into the nutritional composition of foods and the biochemistry of vitamins, especially pantothenic acid (vitamin B5). Her work correlated decreasing bone density with increasing age and connected serum cholesterol levels with dietary fat intake. Morgan remained associated with Berkeley for more than 50 years, and though she retired in 1954, she was active in her field until just before her death. She received the Garvan Medal from the American Chemical Society and the Borden Research Award from the Borden Company Foundation. At Berkeley, the campus nutrition laboratory is named in her honor. Iota Sigma Pi, an American chemistry honor society, presents the Agnes Fay Morgan Research Award to outstanding women in the field. Early life Agnes Fay was born in 1884 in Peoria, Illinois. Her parents were Patrick Fay and his second wife, the former Mary Dooley. Patrick and Mary Fay had come from Galway, Ireland. He was a manual laborer and then a builder. Agnes Fay was the third of the family's four children. A graduate of Peoria High School, Fay received a full college scholarship from a local donor. She went to Vassar College for a short time before transferring to the University of Chicago. Fay enrolled at the University of Chicago as a physics major, but she changed her major to chemistry after taking a course in that subject from Julius Stieglitz. He was an influential chemist who became a member of the National Academy of Sciences and president of the American Chemical Society. Fay completed a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in chemistry in 1904 and 1905, respectively. For about a year, Fay was a college chemistry instructor, though there are conflicting sources as to the name of the college. While teaching at the University of Montana in 1907‚Äì08, Fay married Arthur I. Morgan, who was a senior football player at the university. Though Fay had been Morgan's chemistry teacher, Morgan was four years older than Fay, having enrolled at Montana after military service in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Arthur Morgan became the headmaster of a boy's school and later worked for the Sperry Flour Company, becoming its vice president. After teaching at the University of Washington from 1910 to 1912, Morgan completed a Ph.D. in chemistry at the University of Chicago in 1914. Stieglitz supervised her dissertation. She may have been the only married woman to have received a Ph.D. in chemistry in the first few years of the 20th century. Despite the fact that married women were not generally welcome on university faculties (female professors were usually expected to resign when they married), Stieglitz agreed to write a recommendation letter for Morgan for a position at the University of Illinois. Stieglitz noted in his letter that the university should overlook Morgan's marital status because her husband was ill at the time. Career at Berkeley =Early years= It is not known whether the University of Illinois extended an offer to Morgan, but in any case, she interviewed for a faculty position at Berkeley. She had an interview scheduled with the college's dean, but he sent his wife and his teenage daughter to conduct it. She accepted the Berkeley job, which was in the Department of Home Economics. The position paid $1,800; male faculty members at the university were paid $2,400 with a doctorate and $1,800 without one. When Morgan arrived at Berkeley, she found that she had to teach courses in nutrition and dietetics. Despite her chemistry background, she characterized dietetics as \\"a subject I knew nothing about and nobody else knew much about at that time.\\" She said that she had to research the curriculum \\"mostly out of German medical journals.\\" One of Morgan's stated interests was to lead a program of research into household practices; she did not want to teach traditional home economics principles if they could not be supported by science. This meant that her students were required to possess a science background that was more stringent than other U.S. home economics programs. Consequently, her graduates found themselves prepared for roles that had not usually been open to traditional home economics graduates, such as hospital nutrition management and teaching in the basic sciences. Even among women in academia, Morgan was unusual in that she came from an immigrant family of modest means. In many ways, Morgan was also atypical as a home economist. She disliked cooking and housekeeping, and her style of dress was generally described as \\"dowdy\\" for the first two decades of her time at Berkeley. Since women could not access most parts of the existing Berkeley Faculty Club, Morgan helped to establish the Women's Faculty Club on campus. It was used as a meeting place for lunches and dinners as well as a residence for female faculty members and campus visitors. Morgan's department always faced financial struggles in an era before much federal research funding was available. To raise funds, Morgan provided food service educational courses to teachers, nurses and other participants. These classes ultimately weakened the department's reputation at the university, as school officials viewed the training as vocational and considered it to be beneath the standards of the university. Because of this, Morgan was prohibited from accepting industry funding for research and the university provided her with very little space to conduct her research work. Adding to the difficulty of the situation was the fact that university officials had previously criticized Morgan for maintaining academic standards that were too high for a home economics program. The issue of offering vocational training was part of a larger challenge for Morgan in her first few years at the university. Because of the school's status as a land-grant university, the program was required to follow California State Department of Education directives to produce graduates trained as teachers, agricultural extension specialists and dietitians. However, Benjamin Ide Wheeler, president of the university in the early 20th century, saw those fields as vocations, and he encouraged Morgan to continue her focus on science. =Department leadership, motherhood and later career= From 1916 through her retirement in 1954, Morgan was a department chair or co- chair. Initially, the leadership of the Department of Home Economics was split between Morgan (as the head of the household science division) and Mary Patterson (as the head of the household arts division). Morgan was not fond of sharing a department with Patterson, who had a background in decorative arts and no inclination toward science. By 1920, Berkeley president David Prescott Barrows agreed to Morgan's request to separate the two divisions into distinct departments since they had different curricula, philosophies and faculty, and Morgan became the sole chair of the Department of Household Science. Morgan had waited until her academic rank was secure before becoming pregnant. She had a son in 1923, the same year that she became a full professor. Colleagues were surprised when she had the baby, as she had not mentioned being pregnant and she hid the physical evidence of her pregnancy with her long laboratory jacket. Morgan remembered the reaction of one male colleague when she told him the news; he said if she had five children like he did, she would have hardly noticed the new baby. Morgan's mother moved in with her and cared for the baby so that Morgan could work uninterrupted. In the mid-1920s, Morgan foresaw the eventual need for graduate education in nutrition. She said that dietitians would not be fully appreciated within the medical field without a strong grounding in science and an ability to implement the research findings of laboratory scientists. Wanting to establish dietetics as a profession rather than a service industry, Morgan emphasized the \\"cleavage of the dietitian to the physician's end of the hospital table, and away from the nurse's.\\" This statement itself had little effect at the time, however, as dietetics remained primarily concerned with the practical aspects of feeding people in the hospital. As a department chair, Morgan was known as a stern leader. Though she attracted top faculty members, Morgan was looked upon fearfully by many in home economics. Some faculty members felt that Morgan always thought she was right. Ruth Okey, one of Morgan's colleagues, said, \\"Some of her staff learned to suggest a change indirectly in such a way that Dr. Morgan was convinced that the idea was her own, otherwise her response was likely to be, 'Nonsense!' This characteristic was responsible for the brief stays of several very able staff appointees.\\" =Research and writing= Some of the most significant scientific research to emerge from Morgan's laboratory concerned the biochemistry of vitamins and the nutritional value of foods. She became best known for her work examining the effects of pantothenic acid (vitamin B5) on adrenal gland function. In her early research work, Morgan analyzed processed foods and characterized their vitamin composition. She was the first to establish that a preservative, sulfur dioxide, protected vitamin C but damaged thiamine. In 1938, the Department of Home Economics was moved under the College of Agriculture, and all of the faculty members became affiliated with the California Agricultural Experiment Station. Late in her career, she was involved in an Agricultural Experiment Station project that examined nutrition among older people in San Mateo County. That work yielded two important conclusions: that bone density began to decline in women between the ages of 50 and 65, and that dietary fat intake led to increases in serum cholesterol. In another of her studies, Morgan worked with a fox breeder to study the effects of diets that contained low and normal amounts of B vitamins. The treatment group (the vitamin-restricted foxes) developed a fine, sparse gray coat that resembled the fashionable fur of the silver fox. Morgan found that the foxes with normal intake of B vitamins had shiny black fur. After the experiments, a fur stole was made out of fur from both the treatment and control groups. Morgan wore the stole on at least two important occasions ‚Äì her presentation of the study data in 1939 and her Garvan Medal award ceremony ten years later. Morgan was sometimes sought to investigate public problems on behalf of federal or state governments. She examined the food quality at San Quentin Prison in 1939, and in the 1940s she was the founding chair of the California Nutrition War Committee and served on the Office of Scientific Research and Development. In 1960, Morgan was a member of a committee that looked at the toxicity of pesticides used in agriculture. She co-authored a textbook, Experimental Food Study, with Irene Sanborn Hall, and she wrote detailed histories of the Alpha Nu and Iota Sigma Pi honor societies. Later life and legacy In addition to winning the Garvan Medal in 1949, which is bestowed upon outstanding women in chemistry by the American Chemical Society, Garvan became the first female professor named Faculty Research Lecturer at Berkeley in 1951; Morgan was selected for the honor by her Berkeley faculty colleagues. In 1954, Morgan and Wayne State University researcher Arthur H. Smith were the co-winners of the Borden Research Award from the Borden Company Foundation. Though she officially retired in 1954, Morgan continued to come to the office for nearly the rest of her life. Just after Morgan's retirement, the University of California System decided to offer home economics only at the Davis and Santa Barbara campuses, and the nutrition program was continued at Berkeley. Forty of her papers were published after her retirement date. After suffering a heart attack in early July 1968, Morgan died on July 20. At the time of her death, she still headed the selection committee for new fellows of the American Institute of Nutrition. In the 1960s, the nutrition laboratory at Berkeley was renamed Agnes Fay Morgan Hall. The Iota Sigma Pi chemistry honor society issues the Agnes Fay Morgan Research Award to recognize women who make outstanding contributions to the field. Morgan had been a founding member of the group and she had served the national organization as its permanent historian for many years.

She held the professorship for eight years before retiring from the university and in March 2017. Over her career as an art professor at Stanford she brought John D. Rockefeller's personal collection to the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, which included a \\"a body of 110 paintings described as the museums‚Äô ‚Äúsingle most important gift of art.‚Äù She served as acting director of the Stanford Art Museum now known as the Iris & B. Gerald Cantor Center for Visual Arts. Prior to her position at Stanford she held the Samuel H. Kress Professorship at the Center for Advanced Study in the Visual Arts, at the National Gallery of Art from 2006 to 2007.  Early life and education  She attended Bates College in Lewiston, Maine for two years majoring in history from 1960 to 1962 where she met her future husband, Joe Corn. In 1962, she studied abroad, in London, England, at University of London where she enrolled in University College, the Slade School of Art and Birkbeck College, where began her studies in art history with Nikolaus Pevsner. She said of the experience: > I had grown up next door to the Congregational church where my father was > the minister, so I was very comfortable in churches, in England I was > surrounded by all these marvelous cathedrals, and I went with Pevsner on > field trips to take measurements and to try to discover the little seams > that marked the places where one work period stopped and another picked up. > He was an inspiration to me, and I fell in love with things medieval and > thought that would be what I would spend my life doing. After returning from London, she spent a year in Paris as an au pair for a small local family to learn the French necessary for her continued studies in art history. She later attended New York University for her bachelor's, master's, and doctorate degrees.  Career in art  After graduating from college, she taught at Washington Square College, the University of California, Berkeley, and Mills College. She was appointed the first full-time professor of American art at Stanford University in 1980. Over her tenure at Stanford she served as chair of the departments of art and art history. She also served as the director of the Stanford Humanities Center before becoming acting of the Stanford Museum of Art, now known as the Iris & B. Gerald Cantor Center for Visual Arts. After the 1989 Loma Pieta earthquake, she led the reconstruction of the museum after it had been badly damaged. In 2013, Corn held a conference with Stanford Alumni Association, where she discussed modern society's definition of \\"fine arts\\" and what it means for the museum industry going further into the 21st century. She retired from Stanford as the Robert and Ruth Halperin Professor in Art History. She held the Samuel H. Kress Professorship at the Center for Advanced Study in the Visual Arts at the National Gallery of Art from 2006 to 2007. In 2009, she was the John Rewald Distinguished Visiting Lecturer at the Graduate Center, City University of New York.  Personal life  Corn lives in Palo Alto, California, with her husband Joe Corn, in a home they purchased from painter Sam Francis. Her husband is a \\"historian of science and technology\\".

The flight was conducting a civilian transport from Kinshasa in the southwest of the country to Lubumbashi in the southeast of the country. 17 people were confirmed dead by Congolese Government, while officials estimated that 60 may have lost their lives. Survivors even claimed a higher number of fatalities, claiming that as many as 200 people were sucked out to their deaths. Incident The incident occurred above the city of Mbuji-Mayi on the night of 8 May 2003. The aircraft was an Ilyushin Il-76 registered as UR-UCB and was operated by Ukrainian Cargo Airways, a Ukrainian state-owned charter airline company based in Kiev. The two-hour flight was chartered by the military to transport soldiers and their families to their home in Lubumbashi, which was located on the south of the country in Haut-Katanga Province. Lubumbashi is a home to a large military base in Congo. At the time, the cargo compartment was full of people; many were sleeping in the middle section and near the cargo door. The aircraft had no proper seating, and there were only folding chairs in the cabin with people \\"crammed onto benches and on the floor\\". About forty-five minutes after takeoff from Kinshasha, at an altitude of 10,000 ft, the cargo door of the Ilyushin Il-76 suddenly opened, sucking many passengers out of the aircraft. Several people were clinging to ropes, bags and netting on the interior wall of the plane. Survivors described the scene as chaotic, with people screaming and flying out of the open door. Several people who were sleeping at the time were awakened by other passengers' screams. They also claimed that the plane suddenly tilted to the left and right, causing more people to be sucked out of the plane. Several people that had clung onto ropes lost their grips and were sucked out to their deaths. A secured truck on the cargo hold may have saved many lives as it may have acted like a barrier. Survivors described the commotion: > \\"I was just next to the door and I had the chance to grab onto a ladder just > before the door let loose,\\" > \\"I saw a soldier cradling a baby and a mother with a baby near the door > suddenly just being wrenched into the darkness,\\" The aircraft managed to return to Kinshasha after the incident. The Congolese Government ordered an immediate search for the passengers who had been sucked out of the aircraft. Survivors claimed that many people had disappeared after the incident, and stated that as many as 200 people, including women and children, were killed in the incident. Ukraine's Defence Ministry spokesman Konstantin Khyvrenko stated that no one was hurt in the accident, however survivors stated that many were injured due to flying baggage and cargo. At least 2 pregnant women had miscarriages due to shock. The Government only confirmed the deaths of 17 people, while officials estimated that as many as 60 may have been killed in the incident, while airport officials placed the number of fatalities on 129 people. Aviation officials and western diplomats in Congo estimated that at least 170 people were killed in the incident. Out of 160+ people on the cargo compartment, only around 40 people returned to the airport. Investigation An investigation was ordered immediately after the disaster. Information Minister Kikaya Bin Karubi told Reuters that the air force and army were investigating to determine whether the accident was the result of human error or of a mechanical problem. A sergeant, identified as Sergeant Kabmba Kashala, said the aircraft had taken off with the door improperly fastened. He stated that the door flung open after three failed attempts to fully shut it mid-flight. The pilot suggested the door had opened either after one of the passengers tinkered with its controls, or because of a computer glitch. He stated that a passenger could have been touching the button for special opening device.

Aging is associated with many changes in the central nervous system, such as mild atrophy of the cortex that is considered non- pathological. Aging is also associated with many neurological and neurodegenerative disease such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, dementia, mild cognitive impairment, Parkinson's disease, and Creutzfeldt‚ÄìJakob disease. Normal Structural and Neural Changes Neurogenesis occurs very little in adults, only occurring in the hypothalamus and striatum to a small extent in a process called adult neurogenesis. The volume of the brain actually decrease roughly 5% per decade after forty. It is currently unclear why brain volume decreases with age, however, a few causes may include: cell death, decreased cell volume, and changes in synaptic structure. The changes in brain volume is heterogenous across regions with prefrontal cortex receiving the most significant reduction in volume followed in order by the striatum, the temporal lobe, cerebellar vermis, cerebellar hemispheres, and the hippocampus. However, one review found that the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex remained relatively free of atrophy, which is consistent with the finding of emotional stability occurring with non-pathological aging. Enlargement of the ventricles, sulci and fissures are also common in non-pathological aging. Changes may also be associated with neuroplasticity, synaptic functionality and voltage gated calcium channels. Increased magnitude of hyperpolarization, possibly a result of dysfunctional calcium regulation, leads to decreased firing rate of neurons and decreased plasticity. This effect is particularly pronounced in the hippocampus of aged animals, and may be an important contributor to age-associated memory deficits. The hyperpolarization of a neuron can be divided into three stages: the fast, medium and slow hyperpolarization. In aged neurons, the medium and slow hyperpolarization phases involve the prolonged opening of calcium-dependent potassium channels. The prolonging of this phase has been hypothesized to be a result of deregulated calcium and hypoactivity of cholinergic, dopaminergic, serotonergic and glutaminergic pathways. Normal Functional Changes Episodic memory starts to decline gradually from middle age, while semantic memory increases all the way into early old age and declines thereafter. Older adults tend to engage their prefrontal cortex more often during working memory tasks, possibly to compensate with executive functions. Further impairments of cognitive function associated with aging include decrease in processing speed and inability to focus. A model proposed to account for altered activation posits that decreased neural efficiency driven by amyloid plaques and decreased dopamine functionality lead to compensatory activation. Decreased processing of negative stimuli as opposed to positive stimuli appear in aging, become significant enough to detect even with autonomic nervous responses to emotionally charged stimuli. Aging is also associated with decreased plantar reflex and achilles reflex response. Nerve conductance also decreases during normal aging. =DNA damage= Certain genes of the human frontal cortex display reduced transcriptional expression after age 40, and especially after age 70. In particular, genes that have central roles in synaptic plasticity display reduced expression with age. The promoters of genes with reduced expression in the cortex of older individuals have a marked increase in DNA damage, likely oxidative DNA damage. Pathological Changes Roughly 20% of persons greater than 60 years of age have a neurological disorder, with episodic disorders being the most common followed by extrapyramidal movement disorders, and nerve disorders. Diseases commonly associated with old age include *Multiple system atrophy *Parkinson's disease *Alzheimer's disease *Stroke. *Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis *Creutzfeldt‚ÄìJakob disease *Frontotemporal Dementia *Dementia with Lewy bodies *Corticobasal Degeneration *Transient ischemic attack *Vascular dementia The misfolding of proteins is a common component of the proposed pathophysiology of many diseases associated with aging, however there is insufficient evidence to prove this. For example, the tau hypothesis to Alzheimer's proposes that tau protein accumulation results in the breakdown neuron cytoskeletons leading to Alzheimer's. Another proposed mechanism for Alzheimer's is related to the accumulation of amyloid beta,. in a similar mechanism to the prion propagation of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Similarly the protein alpha-synuclein is hypothesized to accumulate in Parkinson's and related diseases. =Chemo brain= Treatments with anticancer chemotherapeutic agents often are toxic to the cells of the brain, leading to memory loss and cognitive dysfunction that can persist long after the period of exposure. This condition, termed chemo brain, appears to be due to DNA damages that cause epigenetic changes in the brain that accelerate the brain aging process. Management Treatment of an age related neurological disease varies from disease to disease. Modifiable risk factors for dementia include diabetes, hypertension, smoking, hyperhomocysteinemia, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity(which is usually associated with many other risk factors for dementia). Paradoxically, smoking confers protection against Parkinson's disease. Also conferring protective benefits to age related neurological disease in consumption of coffee or caffeine. Consumption of fruits, fish and vegetables confer protection against dementia, as does a mediterranean diet. Physical exercise significantly lowers the risk of cognitive decline in old age, and is an effective treatment for those with dementia and Parkinson's disease.

Teiser (born 1956) is the D. T. Suzuki Professor in Buddhist Studies and Professor of Religion at Princeton University, where he is also the Director of the Program in East Asian Studies.https://religion.princeton.edu/people/faculty/core-faculty/stephen-f- teiser/ His scholarship is known for a broad conception of Buddhist thinking and practice, showing the interactions between Buddhism in India, China, Korea and Japan, especially in the medieval period; for the use of wide-ranging sources, not only texts and documents, but artistic and material; for a theoretical approach that builds insights from history, anthropology, literary theory, and religious studies; and for seeing Buddhism in both elite and popular contexts. Each of his monographs has won a major award. Teiser's first monograph, The Ghost Festival in Medieval China (1988) was awarded the prize in History of Religions by the American Council of Learned Societies. His second book, The Scripture on the Ten Kings and the Making of Purgatory in Medieval Chinese Buddhism (2003) was awarded the Joseph Levenson Book Prize (pre-twentieth century) in Chinese Studies. Reinventing the Wheel: Paintings of Rebirth in Medieval Buddhist Temples (2007) won the Prix Stanislas Julien, awarded by the Acad√©mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres, Institut de France. Education and career Teiser took his undergraduate degree from Oberlin College, then his Master's and Doctorate from Princeton University, where he studied with Alan Sponberg and Denis Twitchett. He is known to his friends as \\"Buzzy.\\" Stephen \\"Buzzy\\" Teiser Center on Contemporary China (Princeton University) Thought, ritual, and popular religion The Ghost Festival was the subject of Teiser's first book, The Ghost Festival in Medieval China. This festival spread geographically and lasted to the present day in various forms in China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. Ancestral spirits are honored, as well as ones that had no descendants to honor them. Teiser found that most of the historical sources and modern scholarship focused on the institutions of the Buddhist church or the services held within its confines, and that they assumed that these institutions and practices developed logically into their historic form. He felt that this neglected the \\"diffused\\" nature of Chinese religion. The Ghost Festival, however, was a \\"complex symbolic event\\" that was not constrained by any one authoritative text. Its myths and rituals involved every social class, each for its own reasons, and expressed their vitality in a range of social contexts not usually identified as \\"religious.\\" Teiser shows that the festival is rooted in traditional Chinese observances in the seventh month, with offerings from the harvest, and also in Buddhist practices from India, where there was not a connection with ancestors, but to a yearly retreat for confession and self- release. There has been disagreement on relation of the festival to the Daoist Festival in which offerings are made to the gods who come to this world to judge the living. Teiser argues that the Buddhist festival influenced the Daoist practice, and that the two are \\"two peaks of pyramids with a common base.\\" Terry F Kleeman, \\"Review,\\" The Journal of Asian Studies 49.1 (1990): 141-142. Quote from Teiser (1988) p. 42. The scholar B.J Ter Haar praised Teiser's approach in because it \\"distinguishes itself from existing historical studies by an extremely open and broad-minded attitude towards the subject and the available sources.\\" That is, Teiser does not \\"confine himself to (or arbitrarily exclude) doctrinal sources, but tries to give all available sources their due,\\" and analyses the different social, literary and religious dimensions of the subject.B.J. Ter Haar, \\"Review\\", T'oung Pao (1993) p. 379 His second book, Reinventing the Wheel: Paintings of Rebirth in Medieval Buddhist Temples (2006) won the Prix Stanislas Julien, awarded by the Acad√©mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres, Institut de France. Teiser uses both literary and visual sources to follow history and interpretations of the Wheel of Rebirth, or Bhavacakra, an iconic circle divided into sections to represent the Buddhist cycle of transmigration. The meaning of the wheel has been interpreted in different ways in India, Tibet, Central Asia, and China. The book shows how these depictions have appeared in local religious architecture and religious rituals, and that these representations shaped concepts of time and reincarnation and organized the cosmology and daily life of these Buddhist societies. \\"The Scripture on the Ten Kings: Making of Purgatory in Medieval Chinese Buddhism, published in 2003, argues that this scripture signals the beginning of a \\"new concept of the afterlife in medieval Chinese Buddhism\\" as a \\"period between death and the next life during which the spirit of the deceased suffers retribution for past deeds and enjoys the comfort of family members.\\" This concept, argues Teiser, is close enough to the situation in medieval Europe to justify the use of the term \\"purgatory.\\" The text of Scripture on the Ten Kings is dated to the ninth century, though the concepts in it crystalized several centuries earlier. Teiser shows that this idea of purgatory was produced by a collaboration between Indic and Chinese worlds, and was then taken up by Korean and Japanese Buddhism. This conception of purgatory is still a defining concept in modern Chinese life. John Kieschnick wrote in Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies that Teiser in these three monographs counters the modernist tendency in present-day Asian Buddhism to emphasize a \\"this-worldly\\" social engagement as well as the Western tendency to use Buddhist practices for self-cultivation and internal experiences. Teiser's point, says Keischnick, is that historically and perhaps even among most Buddhists today, Buddhism was not a practical guide but a \\"framework for understanding and negotiating a cosmos that extends far beyond the visible world in which we live, and far beyond the present, to include future and past lives as gods, ghosts, hell beings, and animals, as well as humans.\\" . Teiser has also edited Readings of the Lotus Sutra (2009). with Jacqueline Ilyse Stone, a group of essays analyzing the Lotus Sutra, and Readings of the Platform Sutra (2012), with Morten Schl√ºtter, which introduces the monk Hui Neng, the Chan Buddhist patriarch, and his most influential sutra.

As Wellington's longest serving City Councillor for 30 years, she served as deputy Labour Leader, then Labour Leader for six years -leading the Labour team to a majority position on the Council. Later she was the first female deputy mayor, chaired the Airport Authority for eight years and all New Zealand Airport Authorities for six. She spearheaded the Declaration of Wellington as a Nuclear Weapon Free Zone; was appointed chair of Wellington's world class Civic Centre project taking its concept plan to unanimous Council agreement, giving Wellington a heart; and chaired the protection of Wellington's historic Town Belt - a six-year project culminating in legislative protection, the Wellington Town Belt Act 2016, and with 130 hectares added to it. Ritchie served on a range of diverse Boards ranging from health, mental health, arts, museums, the natural environment, airports and councils. Early life Ritchie was born in Wellington to refugee parents who had fled the Holocaust in Prague, arriving in New Zealand in 1939 and 1940. She grew up in the state housing area of Naenae and looked after her younger sister at night from age seven while her parents were at work. She attended Hutt Valley High School and became head prefect. Ritchie then studied psychology, education, languages, dispute resolution at Victoria University of Wellington and Massey University of Palmerston North where she was awarded three postgraduate degrees: Master of Arts, Bachelor of Arts with Honours, Bachelor of Educational Studies, and an undergraduate Bachelor of Arts degree, and two diplomas: a Diploma of Education and a Diploma of Business Studies (conflict and dispute resolution). Initially her focus was on promoting equality of opportunity in and through education, working in all levels of education as a secondary school teacher, and later a University extension lecturer, an executive director of a nationwide trade union correspondence education service and in early childhood. She undertook psychology training and was appointed as a psychologist in the Education Department in 1977 (initially assistant psychologist, then psychologist in 1978), focusing on children and families with special needs. Ritchie was instrumental in developing a then innovative approach away from deficit diagnosing and labeling to identifying strengths and needs and enhancing them through a psycho-social and educational approach and developing individual educational plans (IEP's). Ritchie also successfully ensured internally, funding and approval for alternative schooling ‚ÄúActivities Centre‚Äù for young persons who otherwise no longer attended traditional secondary schools, and in the establishing of a new ‚ÄúWork Experience Unit‚Äù within a secondary school for young persons who found traditional schooling too challenging. In 1977 she was first elected to Wellington City Council. In 1966 she married Peter Deans Ritchie and had two children; Timothy in 1971 and Jonathan on July 30, 1972. Political career =National politics= Ritchie came into politics in the 1970s through the women's movement and joined the Labour Party in 1976. She helped develop the Working Women's Charter, led by trade unionist and M.P. Sonja Davies; and was a member of the Labour Women's Council. She later took on leadership roles in the local Women's Electoral Lobby (WEL).‚ÄúUnder Cr Ritchie‚Äôs leadership, WEL Wellington ran a regional conference on ‚ÄúEmpowering Women in April 1989, that attracted 220 women. Workshop topics included: area health boards; local government; starting a business; women and the parliamentary process; breaking down the barriers to participation; and green politics.‚Äù ..‚Ä¶the idea of WEL‚Äôs first national training weekend seminar for women in local government arose on a weekend tramp with WEL member and Wellington City Councillor, Helene Ritchie. ..The seminar was held in Auckland in February 1986.‚Äù  Elspeth Preddy: The WEL Herstory. The Women‚Äôs Electoral lobby in New Zealand 1975-2002. = Parliamentary Candidate = At a time when only 4 women of 87 members were in Parliament and only 13 had ever been in Parliament, she was selected by Labour for the then safe National seat of Ohariu electorate in the New Zealand House of Representatives in the 1978 general election, but was unsuccessful placed second behind National's Hugh Templeton.Norton 1988, p. 294 At the following election she sought the Labour nominations in safe Labour seats, believing that women should be selected for Parliamentary positions where they could make a long-lasting contribution. She sought selection for the safe Labour seat of Christchurch Central in a 1979 by-election. Geoffrey Palmer, later briefly Prime Minister, was selected. She also stood for selection in a number of other safe Labour seats, including, for the Napier electorate in 1980, but lost to Geoff Braybrooke, who held the seat until 2002. Ritchie had also attempted to gain the Labour nomination for the Island Bay electorate in the lead up to the 1987 general election after Frank O'Flynn announced his retirement, but the nomination ultimately went to Elizabeth Tennet. Ritchie stated she was \\"knocked for six\\" after failing to win the Island Bay nomination. Soon after she stood for the Pencarrow electorate, but lost out again, this time to trade unionist Sonja Davies. Upon Braybrooke announcing his retirement, Ritchie was invited by the electorate chair, to again seek the Napier seat, but lost out on the nomination to Russell Fairbrother. = Wellington City Councillor =  First female Labour Leader Wellington City Council Ritchie was first elected in the Capital, to the Wellington City Council in 1977 and then initially served for the next 12 years until 1989 when she resigned as a City councillor. She was elected concurrently to the first Wellington Regional Council in 1980 and resigned from there in 1983. During those 12 years, she was voted the first woman Labour Leader from 1980‚Äì86, and was selected as the official Labour candidate for Mayor (the first woman) in 1983, finishing runner-up to Ian Lawrence. As Chair of the Airport Authority from 1980, for 8 years and of all the Airport Authorities in New Zealand for 5 years, she defied Labour Minister Prebble's early attempt at privatisation of public assets - Wellington Airport. His and Douglas's monetarist free market, \\"Rogernomics\\" approach of extensive privatisation of state assets, and corporisation of the public sector, which the then Labour government pursued contravened Labour‚Äôs basic policy platform. Ritchie saw this as a betrayal of Labour's fundamental policies, and as contrary to her reason for joining the Party. She along with many others, left the Labour Party in 1989. (Prebble and Douglas later left the Labour Party to become leaders of the right wing ACT Party, with Roger Douglas as founder.) Jim Anderton M.P., (later deputy Prime Minister) resigned from the Party in April 1989, saying, ‚ÄúI did not leave the Party, the Party left me‚Äù and created the Alliance Party. Ritchie rejoined after a gap of few years but stood for election as an Independent. In 1986 Ritchie became Deputy Mayor to Jim Belich, the first woman to hold the position in the Capital. She was dumped by her Labour colleagues on the council in 1988. According to Ritchie, no reason was ever given and she thought the episode was \\"very unfair and unjust\\". In October 1989 she stepped down as a councillor and stood for both the Mayoralty and Regional Council. She narrowly lost the Mayoralty but was elected to the Wellington Regional Council for a second time. Ritchie stood for Mayor for a third time in 1992, finishing second again this time to former Wellington Central MP Fran Wilde. Ritchie stepped out of politics for six years to care for her terminally ill husband. She was re-elected in the Northern ward in 1998 and remained on the council for a further 18 years until 2016 when she resigned as a councillor. Apartheid and racism  In 1981 she established a delegation of prominent persons throughout New Zealand and co-led that delegation with the first Ombudsman, Sir Guy Powles, to present a submission to the Governor General Sir David Beattie, disclaiming Apartheid and seeking a stop to the then Springbok Tour of New Zealand.Various articles and photos in The Evening Post and The Dominion, in August 1981.  Declaration of Wellington as a nuclear weapon free zone  Her main achievement was the declaration of Wellington as a nuclear weapon free zone. This Declaration, described by the seconder Hazel Bibby as ‚ÄúPerhaps the most important motion to be debated by this Council‚Äù was at the time when a nuclear warship, the USS Truxton, was about to enter Wellington Harbour. The Declaration had significant national and international repercussions. Within one year, half of New Zealand was living in declared nuclear weapon free zones, and women were spurred on to increase their representation in local government. There was major political fallout too, with two of the country's key leaders - the mayor of Wellington, resigning. First, the mayor, Michael Fowler, aligned to the National Party, announced the day after the motion was passed that he would quit at the end of the term. Despite two of his team crossing the floor, he lashed out in the Dominion article at Labour Councillors, particularly attacking the Labour women - three of whom he had once called the \\"petticoat troika\\" and who were then in the majority of the Labour team. Reportedly he was also furious with his own two councillors Betty Campbell and David Bull, who had crossed the floor of the Council to vote with the Labour councillors and ensure that the motion was passed and the Declaration made. Then on June 14, 1984, Prime Minister Robert Muldoon, furious that one of his members (another woman - Marilyn Waring) crossed the floor and voted with the opposition to support the Bill banning nuclear ships, called a snap election which he then lost. A Labour Government and Prime Minister David Lange were elected on the issue, and later successfully passed the New Zealand Nuclear Free Zone, Disarmament and Arms Control Act 1987.Articles in The Evening Post and The Dominion Post on 23 April 1982.

Moa Point Campaign  Ritchie spearheaded and led as a councillor and Labour leader, the five year citywide Moa Point campaign which then, with a Labour majority in 1986 ensured that her motion passed, ensuring that the City adopted land based treatment to stop the City's raw sewage being discharged onto the beaches.  Civic Centre  In 1986 Ritchie chaired the Civic Centre project, saying it would give Wellington a heart.The Evening Post, March 1982 Earlier, in 1982, Ritchie's motion stopped the demolition intention of the then mayor Michael Fowler, of the historic Wellington Town Hall. The later strengthening and upgrade of the Town Hall then in became part of the Civic Centre project. Two years later, in 1988 on the cusp of her then being dumped from the deputy mayoralty and all of the appointed positions which she held, she ensured Council adopted unanimously the concept plan which included an integrated and innovative concept of eclectic and world class architecture, the protection of older buildings threatened with demolition ‚Äì the former City Library and the Town Hall ‚Äì and the construction of new buildings and an open Civic public square (formerly road), complete with the tall emblematic Nikau palm structures. This concept plan excluded the earlier 1986 proposal to build on what became Ilott Green. The retention of this small green open space, where formerly the Circa Theatre had stood, continued then to be fought over as for over 20 years, as successive Councils proposed various building developments for it.  Johnsonville Library and Pool upgrade Ritchie focused and campaigned for years in her ward for a new library for Johnsonville alongside the upgraded pool and community centre as a cohesive community hub. The library was first formally agreed by the council in 2006 Johnsonville Town Centre Plan. Then followed Council procrastination. In 2009,Wellington City Council Minutes 2009 she secured council support for her motion to ensure that a new library be built next door to the Keith Spry Pool. But despite strong public support for this, between 2010-13 council staff and a newly elected councillor again deferred the project and looked at a range of new locations. In 2011, 4 potential sites were consulted on and the Northern Ward public and council again agreed that the site co-located with the Keith Spry Pool was the best site. In February 2014 The Independent Herald, February - March 2016 Ritchie secured funding approval from the Council which was then the most major new capital expenditure item for that triennium, was made that year. Planning started then, construction began in 2016, and this new community asset and hub was planned to be opened in 2019.  Press Council Ritchie versus the Dominion Post In 2007 the Press Council upheld a complaint on the grounds of inaccuracy about two articles in the Dominion Post - as well as a third - that reported on Wellington City councillor Helene Ritchie's attendance record and remuneration while on sick leave for breast cancer.NZ Media Council Case Number 2003 Helene Ritchie against The Dominion Post September 2007 This had followed an earlier attempt by four male councillors to block (by walking out of the vote) her request for sick leave.  Wellington Waterfront  Ritchie also focused on open and recreational space on the waterfront, personally and successfully submitting to the Environment Court, alongside Waterfront Watch led by Pauline Swann, to ensure open public space instead of a Hilton Hotel colonising a large part of the Waterfront for private gain and use.Hilton Appeal 17 Form 33 Notice of a Person‚Äôs Wish to be a Party (Section 274, Resource Management Act 1991) to proceedings, 17 November 2006, Helene Ritchie The Court in its decision said: ‚ÄúMr McClelland and Mrs Ritchie.

Mrs Ritchie said the decision showed the City Council needed to ‚Äúget real‚Äù about the Waterfront and acknowledge public concern about how it was being developed.‚Äù  Supercity proposal 2009‚Äì2016  She initiated opposition, and repeatedly over six years. Ultimately successful along with others, stopping the proposal that Wellington follow Auckland and become a ‚ÄúSuper City‚Äù. Health Board and Mental Health Her focus as a Health Board member was primarily on improving mental health services establishing and heading a mental health subcommittee, and on attempting to lower the rate of suicides Helene Ritchie's speech to the Board re planning for a target of zero suicides and on the provision of home and community support services. Eventually in 2010, after years‚Äô long campaigns, she succeeded in to persuading the Board members, Chief Executives and the Chair, the Ministry of Health officials and Minister, to approve the necessary funding for a replacement and upgraded mental health recovery unit in the hospital. Ritchie received a letter from a Minister in the National Government, the Honourable Chris Finlayson, confirming approval just prior to the 2010 election on 9 September 2010 which said: > \\"Dear Helene, We spoke recently about plans for Ward 27 at Wellington > Regional Hospital. I have written to the Minister of Health and he has > advised the Capital & Coast DHB has submitted a business case to the > Ministry of Health and it is expected the renovation of facilities will be > completed within a two year time frame.

Yours sincerely Chris > Finlayson MP‚Äù The Hon. Chris Finlayson 10 September 2010 In 2016 Ritchie was in the media headlights after being caught parking her car (which had her name written on the bonnet and doors) over a pedestrian crossing in the carpark at Wellington Hospital. She later apologised for the incident and it was also revealed that a section of the carpark was fenced off by construction workers, reducing the number of spaces available.  Wellington Town Belt and Wellington‚Äôs Natural Environment  Ritchie's last six years on the Council were primarily devoted to improving the natural environment in Wellington in her role as Portfolio leader of the natural environment - extending the Outer Town Belt with the procuring of land and earlier protecting the Old Coach Road in the Northern Ward after many years and alongside much effort by local people. Her key focus from 2010 to 2016 as chair was leading the successful and historic protection of Wellington's Town Belt, The law (2016), which was developed by the Council committee, consulted on widely with the Wellington public and introduced by the local member of Parliament, Grant Robertson, ultimately protected (and enhanced) the over 600 hectares of public green space enveloping the Capital - the Harbour and the hills. In 2016, Ritchie resigned as a councillor but stood for the mayoralty. This was won by Justin Lester.Election 2016 Preliminary Results for the Mayor Wellington City Council.

His business accomplishments include the founding of Jamaica's first modern department store (Issa's of King Street), the country's first shopping plazas (Tropical Plaza at Half-Way-Tree and Liguanea Plazas), Jamaica's first supermarket (Hi- Lo at Cross Roads in Kingston), Jamaica's modern horse-racing track (Caymanas Park) and being a guiding force behind the development of New Kingston, now the island's commercial center. He built Tower Isle Hotel, Jamaica's first all-season resort later evolving it into Couples Hotel, Jamaica's first all- inclusive resort and first couples only resort.Hannah, Barbara Makeda Blake. ‚ÄúAbe Issa, Mr. Jamaica.‚Äù The Gleaner, November 5, 2015, sec. Hospitality Jamaica. Early life Abe Issa was born in Kingston, Jamaica to Mary Brimo (died 1953), daughter of Damascus, Syria merchant Joseph Brimo, and Elias Abraham Issa (May 29, 1876 - September 1, 1969), son of Bethlehem, Palestine merchant Abraham Issa who immigrated to Kingston, Jamaica in 1894 with his son Elias. Abe's parents Elias and Mary were married on Feb 25, 1900 and the union gave birth to four children, Bertha, Abe, Joseph, and Annie. The Issa family struggled to establish itself in Kingston. A small notions shop, opened at 32 Princess Street in 1894, failed and Abe's father and grandfather were reduced to peddling goods door to door until they could open a new shop at 27 Orange Street. By 1900 they succeeded in bringing Abe's grandmother Sara and his father's brothers John, Antonio and Joseph to Jamaica. In 1901 Abe's father Elias formed a partnership with his brothers as E.A. Issa & Bros. The enterprise thrived and in 1905 moved to 132 Harbour Street. The shop was destroyed in the January 14, 1907 Kingston earthquake which also took the life of Abe's Uncle Joseph. With their goods only half insured and their books destroyed the brothers strove to recover and managed to reopen business at Penchon and Barry streets on April 4, 1907. The business flourished and in 1911 moved to the more advantageous 135 Harbour Street then, as business grew, to the larger 153-157 Harbour Street. Abe Issa began his elementary education at St. Aloysius School in 1910 then went on to high school studies at St. George's College from 1918-1922. Following a nine-month stint teaching English to South American students, he departed for Worcester, Massachusetts to begin his university education at College of the Holy Cross. In 1926 he graduated summa cum laude and delivered his valedictory address in Latin.Issa, Suzanne. Mr. Jamaica Abe Issa Suzanne Issa, 1994. p. 8-24 Career Abe returned to Kingston in 1926 and entered the family business. On Dec. 1930 he opened the family's first retail store, Issa's of King Street, that featured international luxury goods. By force of his personality and his insistence on quality service the business thrived. He and his family would go on to expand their retail business opening three more shops on King Street while expanding the original store from two to four stories and introducing the first escalator in Jamaica. In 1958 he would purchase Nathan's, the leading competitor department store. In the early 1930s Abe traveled extensively on the business‚Äô behalf to North America and Europe. In 1934 he traveled Japan via Russia and the Trans-Siberian Railroad and worked 14 months in Yokohama operating a factory that manufactured rubber-soled shoes.Issa, Suzanne. Mr. Jamaica Abe Issa Suzanne Issa, 1994. p. 28 Abe's international experiences and knowledge of luxury quality merchandise combined with his outgoing and effusive personality served him well in the family's first move outside the retail trade. On March 14, 1943 the Issa's bought the Myrtle Bank Hotel and a next door laundry from United Fruit Company for ¬£35,000. Under Abe's guidance the hotel gained renown as a favored gathering spot of celebrities and distinguished visitors. Its guests included actor Errol Flynn, jazz great Louis Armstrong, actress Joan Crawford, Walt Disney, future Jamaican prime minister Norman Manley, future United States presidential candidate Adlai Stevenson II and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill.Issa, Suzanne.

Mr. Jamaica Abe Issa Suzanne Issa, 1994. p. 34 The following year he made a foray into politics by forming the Jamaica Democratic Party. While the party failed to win any legislative seats in the 1944 election it began Abe's long involvement in the affairs of the soon-to-be independent nation.Issa, Suzanne. Mr. Jamaica Abe Issa Suzanne Issa, 1994. p. 59 Abe's boldest move came in 1948 when he built Jamaica's first all-season resort outside the then undeveloped fishing port town of Ocho Rios. Built on a north coast cove with a small barrier reef island Tower Isle Hotel became an immediate sensation and a destination for the well-heeled and glitterati of those days. Abe was pictured with actress Ava Gabor, boxing champion Joe Louis, actresses Debbie Reynolds, Jane Russell and Mary Martin, playwright No√´l Coward, film director Cornel Lumiere, Britain's Princess Margaret, singer Lena Horne, travel writer Eugene Fodor, actor Errol Flynn and comedian Norman Wisdom. Tower Isle's success triggered the explosion of tourist destinations on Jamaica's north coast.Issa, Suzanne.

Frequently ahead of his time Abe rebranded Tower Isle as Couples Hotel in 1978 converting it from an all-comers hotel to Jamaica's first all-inclusive and couples-only resort, creating a business model that would be widely imitated. The hotel remains a part of the Issa family properties as Couples Tower Isle and became the foundation property of Couples Resorts. The barrier reef island upon which a tower stands and from which the property's name derives serves as the resort's au naturel beach. In 1955 Abe became the first President of the newly formed Jamaica Tourist Board serving in that post until 1963. He led an aggressive international marketing campaign. Jamaican tourism grew from 86,000 tourists and ¬£4 million in revenue in 1955 to 227,000 tourists with ¬£38 million in revenue in 1962.Jamaica Tourist Board \\"Come to Jamaica 1955-1963.‚Äù Jamaicans.com, October 27, 2014. http://www.jtbonline.org/jtb/come-to-jamaica/ In 1958 he was appointed to Jamaica's legislative council on approval by the Queen.‚ÄúAbe Issa Appointed to Jamaica Post.‚Äù Pittsburgh Press, June 29, 1958, sec. 5, p. 12 In 1959 he was elected President of the Caribbean Tourist Association.

In 1961 Abe became Chief Executive of the House of Issa, the successor family entity to E.A. Issa & Bros. In 1969 the family's patriarch Elias Issa passed at age 93 leaving behind a great legacy and a memorable quote, ‚ÄúNothing shortens life like worry‚Ä¶ my worries don‚Äôt last. I do something about them.‚Äù On August 6, 1962 Jamaica became an independent nation and Abe played several key roles in the young nation's economic development. He served as a director of the Jamaica Industrial Development Corporation, headed the Development Finance Corporation, and its successor Jamaica Development Bank and as director of the Urban Development Corporation, where he outlined plans for cruise ship access to Kingston's harbor. He served as chairman of Jamaica Unit Trust Services Ltd. the managing company of the Jamaica Investment Fund and in 1974 served as chairman of Free Zone Promotional Council. From 1965-1972 he served as a Board Member of Air Jamaica.

He founded the Harvard Apparatus company, which produced laboratory equipment for teaching and research in physiology, and was the founding editor of the American Journal of Physiology. Early life and education Porter was born on September 24, 1862, in Plymouth, Ohio. His father was also a physician. He attended the St. Louis Medical College (now the Washington University School of Medicine) and received his M.D. in 1885. He then studied physiological chemistry briefly in Philadelphia before traveling to Germany for further study with Walther Flemming, Martin Heidenhain, and Karl H√ºrthle. This exposure to the German style of practical, experimental work in the then- emerging field of physiology would shape his future career as an educator. Medical and academic career On returning to the United States, Porter became a resident physician at the St. Louis Medical College. In 1887 he became a professor at the school and began teaching physiology, and is believed to have established the first physiology laboratory west of the Mississippi River. He published several papers on physiology while at St. Louis and was elected to the American Physiological Society at the society's fourth meeting in 1891. Henry Pickering Bowditch, one of the founders of APS and a professor at Harvard Medical School, recruited Porter to Harvard in 1893 to develop the school's educational program in physiology, then based heavily on demonstration. Porter's experiences in Germany led him to promote practical experimental work for students. To manufacture the necessary laboratory equipment, he set up a machine shop at Harvard. In 1901, then-president Charles W. Eliot financed Porter's founding of the Harvard Apparatus Company to sell the improved equipment. The company was converted to a non-profit organization in 1934 and its financial surplus was used to found a fellowship at Harvard in Porter's name. Porter hired former student Walter Bradford Cannon to assist in teaching physiology; eventually Porter's high standards and high failure rates for students in his courses led to a dispute that ended in Cannon being given Bowditch's former chair and Porter being moved to a professorship of comparative physiology, with which he was disappointed. The result was a years-long \\"breach\\" between the two; however, Cannon supported numerous honors for Porter from the APS, including the honorary presidency at the society's 50th-anniversary celebration in 1937. Porter retired from Harvard, assuming professor emeritus status, in 1928 but remained active in APS activities and with the Harvard Apparatus company. He was given the distinction of an honorary membership in the APS in 1948, the only American to receive one. His research is recognized as foundational to modern understanding of coronary artery disease. American Journal of Physiology The American Journal of Physiology was first proposed among prominent American physiologists in 1894, and the proposal was renewed in 1897, with the membership of the APS supporting the idea. Porter became the founding editor of the new journal, which released its first issue in 1898; he would continue in this role until 1914. The journal was primarily financed by Porter personally, with support from the APS; when Porter formally transferred it to the APS in 1914, the APS became one of the first American scientific societies to publish its own journal. Personal life Porter married his wife Alma Canfield Sterling in 1893 and the couple had one child. In addition to his teaching duties, Porter occasionally wrote for the general public, as in his series of dispatches on combat trauma among soldiers in World War I, published in the Atlantic Monthly and later compiled as Shock at the Front. Porter died of bronchopneumonia on February 16, 1949. After Porter's death, Harvard colleague A. Clifford Barger remembered him with the description, \\"Physiology was Porter's religion; he had no other.\\" Porter's papers are held by the Harvard Medical Library.

He is primarily remembered for the quality of his chess journalism, and for his association with Wilhelm Steinitz, the first winner of a world chess championship match.  Life and career  Potter was born in London on 27 August 1840 to William and Mary Anne (Martin) Potter. He had three brothers and a sister, Mary Potter. A barristers' clerk by trade, Potter first appeared in London chess circles in 1867 and rose quickly from obscurity, winning the 1870 City of London Chess Club handicap tournament, in which he defeated Joseph Henry Blackburne and Cecil Valentine De Vere on even terms. From 1872 to 1874 the City of London Chess Club contested a two-game correspondence chess match with Vienna: the other London team members eventually dropped out, leaving Potter and Steinitz to continue the match by themselves, which they ultimately won by a score of 1.5‚Äì0.5. Steinitz would later point to this match as the beginning of the \\"systematic analytical development of modern ideas\\" in chess. In 1875 Potter lost a hard-fought match against Johannes Zukertort, scoring two wins and four losses with eight draws. In 1879 he drew a match against James Mason, both sides scoring five wins apiece with eleven draws. Potter was a chess columnist for the Westminster Papers from 1868 to 1879. From 1874 to 1876 he produced his own periodical, the City of London Chess Magazine, which featured contributions from Zukertort and Steinitz. Subsequently, he became the last chess editor at Land and Water from 1877 to 1885. He also contributed the well-reviewed article on chess in the ninth edition of Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. After 1885 Potter retired from the London chess scene. He died in his home in Sutton on 13 March 1895.  Assessment and legacy  In Potter's obituary, the British Chess Magazine noted that though \\"his record of first-class play is not a long one\\", \\"the quality of his best play entitles him, we think, to rank as the equal of any British-born master of his time, with the single exception of Blackburne.\\" Regarding Potter, Steinitz once said: \\"Put all the pieces into a hat and shake them out on to the board, and you have Potter‚Äôs style exactly\\"; but nevertheless acknowledged him as \\"a very fine player of the modern school, as well as unquestionably the ablest analyst in England next to Zukertort.\\" Emanuel Lasker claimed in his Manual of Chess that Potter \\"had influenced Steinitz greatly\\" but subsequent commentators have cast doubt on this assessment. For his part, Steinitz claimed that Potter \\"was my pupil direct for some time.\\" Potter's chess writings are praised for their mastery, liveliness and wit. The Oxford Companion to Chess records two opening variations bearing Potter's name, one in the Scotch Game (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 exd4 4.Nxd4 Bc5 5. Nb3) which he introduced in the 1870s and which was revived in the 2000s by Vassily Ivanchuk and Magnus Carlsen, and one in the Compromised Defence to the Evans Gambit (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5 4.b4 Bxb4 5.c3 Ba5 6.d4 exd4 7.0-0 dxc3 8.Qb3 Qf6 9.e5 Qg6 10.Nxc3 Nge7 11.Rd1) which he gave in his Land and Water column. The Saavedra position, one of the best- known endgame studies in chess, originates from a game of Potter's against Richard Fenton in 1875: see Saavedra position#History.

Several area churches partnered to form the local YMCA in 1857. It was one of the first chapters formed west of the Mississippi River. with Its activities ceased during the American Civil War, and it was reformed in 1866. They rented rooms on Main Street for their activities. Its first modest gymnasium was outfitted in 1884, and it was improved in 1992 when YMCA took over the facilities over the former Dubuque Athletic Club. The local YMCA completed the first section of this facility two years later, with the second section completed in 1916. Often the local YMCA chapters copied or adapted one another's building designs, which gave their facilities an institutional character in form and style. The Romanesque Revival style was popular in Iowa in the 19th century, which is reflected in the 1894 section. In the early 20th century they generally employed the Neoclassical and Commercial styles, and the 1916 wing reflects the Commercial style. YMCA remained here until 1969, when they opened a new joint facility with the YWCA on Dodge Street. This building became the Iowa Inn, which rented rooms to low-income people. MetroPlains Development of St. Paul, Minnesota bought the building in 2000 and renovated it into an apartment building for senior citizens known as the Henry Stout Apartments. It was named for an early supporter of YMCA in Dubuque. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002.

She graduated from Wilberham Academy and attended Smith College for one year before pursuing her artistic education at Cooper Union, during which time she also studied with J. Alden Weir. Beginning in the late 1880s she lived for five years in Paris, studying there with Alfred Stevens and attending William Bouguereau's classes at the Acad√©mie Julian and those of Gustave Courtois at the Acad√©mie Colarossi. She is known to have exhibited at the Paris Salon as early as 1887, appearing there again in 1892 before her return to New York. She also submitted paintings to the National Academy of Design for exhibition in 1890 and 1892, signing the latter work \\"H. Campbell Foss\\" in an attempt to obscure her gender. She taught drawing and painting at the Woman's College of Baltimore, now Goucher College, from 1892 until 1895; in 1899, when she showed a piece at the Royal Academy in London, she gave an address in Paris once more. Foss exhibited her work at the Palace of Fine Arts at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. In 1900 she exhibited a piece at the Exposition Universelle. Beginning in 1905 Foss maintained a New York studio and a home in Stamford, Connecticut; in 1909 she moved to Darien, becoming active with the Seven Arts League.

It succeeded the Novocherkassk Cathedral as the main place of Christian worship in the Don region.  Background  At the end of the 18th century, after a large-scale resettlement to suburbs of soldiers, burghers and merchants, the city authorities decided to build a temple dedicated to the Navity of the Theotokos. It was meant to be constructed in the same suburb, near the present-day Central market. The church was founded on February 20, 1781, and opened on September 5, 1781. Both the beginning of construction works and opening of the church were consecrated by Archpriest Ioann Andreev. However, only ten years after, on December 27, 1791, a lightning strike burned the temple. The then mayor of the city ‚Äï M. Naumov, a merchant, petitioned to Metropolitan Gavriil, who was the head of Ekaterinoslav Diocese and supervised the territory of Rostov on the construction of the new church. In 1795 at the same place began the construction works of the Church of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin. In 1822 the church received cathedral status on decree of the Holy Synod.–†–æ—Å—Ç–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π —Å–æ–±–æ—Ä –†–æ–∂–¥–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –ü—Ä–µ—Å–≤—è—Ç–æ–π –ë–æ–≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥–∏—Ü—ã  History  A vintage postcard In the mid-19th century, the population of Rostov was growing steadily. As a result, Emperor Nicholas I approved the draft for a new stone church instead of the old masonry temple with wooden domes that could not contain the crowds of worshippers. The cathedral was built between 1854 to 1860 to Konstantin Ton's generic, or model design. As a result, the cathedral looks similar to other churches designed by Ton, such as the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow, the demolished Presentation Church in St. Petersburg and the Cathedral of the Holy Ghost in Petrozavodsk. Alexander Kutepov was the architect in charge of construction works. The funds for construction came from the rich merchant Konstantin Mikhailov-Nefedov. Another local merchant, Igor Panchenko, financed frescoes, icons, golden crosses for the domes, and the church fence. In 1937 the cathedral was closed, and on its territory was opened a zoo, and the cathedral itself was used as warehouse. In the 1940s the upper tiers of the bell tower were destroyed. The cathedral was opened again in 1942, when Rostov was occupied by German army. In 1950 the cathedral was redecorated and the old paintings were restored. In 1988 the interior redecoration was also done. In 1999, on the 250th anniversary of the city of Rostov, the bell tower was restored in its original form.–û–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω–∏–µ –†–æ—Å—Ç–æ–≤—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –∫–∞—Ñ–µ–¥—Ä–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Å–æ–±–æ—Ä–∞ –†–æ–∂–¥–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –ü—Ä–µ—Å–≤—è—Ç–æ–π –ë–æ–≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥–∏—Ü—ã  Exterior and interior  A glimpse of the interior Monument to Dimitry of Rostov Nativity Cathedral is a five-domed stone church, the building itself has a shape of cross. It was built in Russian-Byzantine style. Three-tiered iconostasis in the eastern part of the cathedral is made in the form of a chapel, topped with hipped roof and cupola. In the courtyard of the cathedral there are also situated a small Church of St. John the Baptist and the baptistery of St. Nicholas, as well as the bell tower and several office buildings: the diocesan administration, the residence of the Metropolitan of the Rostov diocese and diocesan departments and commissions; spiritual and educational center of St. Dimitry, Metropolitan of Rostov; printing house of the diocese; church utensils and spiritual literature shops.  The bell tower  In 1875, the west side of the bell tower of the Cathedral was founded. It was built on project of architect-engineer Anton Campioni and artist-architect Dmitry Lebedev. Construction was carried out at the expense of merchants P. Maksimov and S. Koshkin, of tobacco manufacturer and philanthropist V. Asmolov, and of I. Panchenko, who already then had become a churchwarden. The bell tower was completed in 1887. The bell tower has a height of 75 metres. It also has Classicist and Renaissance features. The top of the dome is blue, decorated with gold stars. In the top tier there were installed clocks. In the middle tiers there were placed bells It is believed that the ringing of the bell tower was heard over 40 kilometres. During World War II there were fears that the bell tower can be used by the Germans as a reference point for artillery and bombers. In July 1942 the top two tiers were blown up. In 1949 the second tier was also demolished. The bell tower was restored in 1999. Architect N. Solnyshkin was the author of restoration project. New bells differ from their predecessors with names and their smaller sizes.

The founders were Alessandro Bonsanti and Alberto Carocci. The publisher was Edizioni di Solaria. The magazine was published on a monthly basis. The major goal of Solaria was to Europeanize Italian culture and to emphasize the contributions of Italian modernist writers such as Svevo and Federigo Tozzi to European modernism. The magazine adopted a modernist approach. Solaria had an anti-fascist stance. The contributors of the magazine were mostly the short story writers. They included Alberto Carocci, Eugenio Montale, Elio Vittorini, Carlo Emilio Gadda. and Renato Poggioli. The novel of Elio Vittorini, Il garofano rosso, was first published in the magazine. The magazine also featured poems by young Italian artists such as Sandro Penna. It was harshly criticised by other Italian literary circles and magazines, including Il Selvaggio, Il Bargello and Il Frontespizio, due to its frequent coverage of Jewish writers. After producing a total of forty-one volumes Solaria ceased publication in 1936. The final issue was dated 1934, although it was published in 1936. In fact, it was banned due to the censorship exerted by the fascist authorities. The reason for this censorship was partly the serialization of Elio Vittorini's novel, Il garofano rosso, in the magazine.

He served as Second Deputy Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (then Republic of the Congo) from August 1961 until January 1963, and as President of the Province of North Katanga from September 1963 until his death with a brief interruption. Sendwe was born in 1917 in Mwanya, Kabongo Territory, Belgian Congo to a Baluba family. He was educated in Methodist schools and medical institutions. Unable to become a doctor due to restrictions on advancement for Africans in the colony, he found work as a minister, teacher, and nurse. Sendwe was involved in several cultural organisations, and in 1957 he founded BALUBAKAT to fight for the interests of the Baluba. He espoused nationalism and believed that the Congo should remain a united country after the end of Belgian rule. In May 1960 he was elected to the newly constituted Chamber of Deputies shortly before the country's independence. Sendwe wished to obtain control over the government of Katanga Province, but lost a power struggle to his rival, Mo√Øse Tshombe, and the Conf√©d√©ration des associations tribales du Katanga (CONAKAT) party. Regardless, Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba nominated him for the office of State Commissioner for Katanga. In early July 1960 Tshombe announced the secession of an independent State of Katanga. Sendwe opposed the breakaway state and rejected Tshombe's entreaties for him to join the rebel government, rupturing relations between the two men. Invested with the responsibilities of State Commissioner by the Senate, Sendwe unsuccessfully attempted to restore central government control over Katanga. After a period of turmoil he was appointed Deputy Prime Minister in August 1961 with the hope that he could use his political influence to win the central government support in Katanga. Four months later he was made Commissioner-General Extraordinaire for the province, nominally giving him complete authority over the area. Sendwe's political prospects were severely damaged in December 1962 when the Senate censured him and forced his subsequent resignation from the deputy premiership. In early 1963, he increasingly focused his activities in Katanga, as the province acceded to central authority and Tshombe fled into exile. The territory was divided into new political units against Sendwe's wishes. Despite his dissatisfaction, he assumed office as President of North Katanga in September. In January 1964 he lost his position as president of BALUBAKAT. In June Simba rebels overthrew his government. On 19 June they killed him, though it is unclear who held ultimate responsibility for his death. Sendwe's demise greatly demoralised the Baluba, and his reputation thereafter drifted into obscurity.  Biography  Jason Sendwe was born in 1917 in Mwanya, Kabongo Territory, Belgian Congo to a Baluba family. He was a childhood friend of Mo√Øse Tshombe. He received six years of primary schooling from Methodists in Kabongo and four years of secondary education at the Kanene Methodist Mission in Kamina. For five years he took nursing courses in Stanleyville and at the √âcole officielle pour Infirmiers √† √âlisabethville. He completed his studies at the √âcole des Assistants Indig√®nes de L√©opoldville, graduating as a nurse. Sendwe's aspirations to become a doctor were curtailed by the lack of educational opportunity under colonial rule, but he worked as a minister and a teacher at the Kanene Methodist Mission. In 1942 he entered the service of the colonial administration as a clerk. He later became a nurse and then a medical assistant, working in √âlisabethville, Mutshatsha, Kongolo and Kabongo. He was a founding member and treasurer of the Amiti√©s Belgo-Congolaises cultural organisation, treasurer of the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts, councilor of the Association Saint-Luc, councilor of the Foyer social L√©opold III, and served on the council of the Church of Christ in the Congo. He was married and had eight children. = Entry into politics = In 1957 Sendwe founded and became president of the Association G√©n√©rale des Baluba du Katanga (BALUBAKAT) to encourage unity among the Baluba of the Katanga Province. He was able amass much of their support through his dynamic leadership style and frequent interactions with the population. Three tenants underlined his political philosophy: # Protection of the Baluba # Achievement of Congolese independence # Primacy of conciliation in settling disputes. In 1958 Sendwe attended the Brussels Expo, working as a medical assistant at the African Personnel Reception Center. Afterwards he joined the short-lived Mouvement pour le Progres National Congolais, a party formed by attendees of the exposition. On 5 February 1959 Sendwe brought BALUBAKAT into Tshombe's Conf√©d√©ration des associations tribales du Katanga (CONAKAT) party on the condition that it be able to maintain a significant amount of autonomy. He initially shared the xenophobic stances of CONAKAT, but soon grew concerned that its hostility toward immigrants would extend to incoming Baluba. Sendwe was also worried by Tshombe's close connections to the Belgians and was repulsed by the prominence of several of his political rivals within the party's ranks. BALUBAKAT began to form two trends, one sympathetic to CONAKAT, and the other supportive of the Mouvement National Congolais (MNC). The latter was led by Sendwe. In October he sent a letter to Baudouin, King of the Belgians, urging him to oppose efforts at \\"dismantling the immense country\\" created by his predecessors. In late 1959 Sendwe withdrew BALUBAKAT from CONAKAT. He subsequently negotiated the formation of a \\"Cartel Katangais\\" between BALUBAKAT and two other organisations. Sendwe met with Baudouin on 25 December. In January 1960 he went to Brussels to participate in the Belgo- Congolese Round Table Conference. In May he traveled to the United States at the invitation of the American government. = Rise to prominence = In the national elections before the Republic of the Congo's independence on 30 June 1960 Sendwe earned a seat in the Chamber of Deputies, elected with 20,282 votes from the √âlisabethville constituency. CONAKAT won a slight majority of the seats in the Katanga Provincial Assembly, and could thus determine the composition of the provincial government. Sendwe ordered the BALUBAKAT deputies to abstain from sitting, thus when the assembly convened on 5 June it did not have a quorum to vote on the provincial portfolios. CONAKAT offered Sendwe the office of Katanga Vice-President and the responsibility of several ministries, but he refused to negotiate. On 15 June the Belgian Parliament modified the Congo's provisional constitution to reduce the number of deputies necessary for a quorum to vote on a government. Cartel Katangais representatives subsequently declared that they would wait for the Congolese central government's decision after independence. That same day Sendwe signed a deal with MNC leader Patrice Lumumba to create a coalition in Parliament to support a government under Lumumba. In exchange, BALUBAKAT would get some ministerial portfolios and Sendwe would be nominated to be the State Commissioner for Katanga. On 19 June a BALUBAKAT delegation led by Prosper Mwamba Ilunga covertly traveled to L√©opoldville to meet with Lumumba. They encouraged him to dismiss Sendwe if he did not follow his instructions and they expressed their disapproval of Sendwe's decision to instruct the BALUBAKAT deputies to boycott the Katanga Provincial Assembly. On 23 June the Cartel Katangais declared its ideal Katangese government, with Sendwe as Provincial President. In the meantime CONAKAT voted in its own government. Despite this, Lumumba, having become Prime Minister, nominated Sendwe to be the State Commissioner for Katanga. The President of the Katanga Provincial Assembly, Charles Mutaka, threatened secession if the appointment were confirmed. In early July Tshombe went forward with the secession of the province with Belgian backing but actively sought Sendwe's support, hoping to build a coalition that would bring the latter in as vice-president of an independent Katanga. Sendwe rejected the idea, rupturing relations between them. Tshombe thereafter \\"outlawed\\" him from Katanga. The Senate initially rejected all of Lumumba's nominees for state commissioner. However, on 22 July the body, in a move meant to convey its wish that central government authority be reestablished in Katanga, voted to confirm Sendwe's appointment, 42 to 4 with 7 abstentions. Invested with the responsibilities of his office, Sendwe vainly attempted restore central control over the province. His attempts to do so as well as his hopes of brokering an understanding between BALUBAKAT and CONAKAT at the national level were stymied by the Belgian government, which disliked his closeness to Lumumba. Map of the factions in the Congo in 1961, including the State of Katanga Sendwe was slated to lead part of the army into northern Katanga to reestablish the central government's authority, but this plan dissolved following Lumumba's dismissal by President Joseph Kasa-Vubu in September. The dismissal caused a substantial amount of turmoil and Sendwe was appointed by the Chamber to serve on a reconciliation commission to achieve an understanding between Kasa-Vubu and Lumumba; he acted as its rapporteur. Meanwhile, northern Katangese rejected Tshombe's leadership and the secession in favor of Sendwe, who they saw as a proponent of nationalism and a protector of the Baluba. Sendwe also enjoyed a substantial amount of popularity around √âlisabethville, posing a significant political threat to Tshombe. However, many politicians in the central government saw him as having been too close with the deposed prime minister. On 19 October, three days after Tshombe concluded a deal with Colonel Joseph-D√©sir√© Mobutu to \\"neutralise\\" Lumumba, Sendwe was incarcerated by central government officials. The United Nations (UN) quickly secured his release on the basis of parliamentary immunity. With its sponsorship, Sendwe went on a tour of northern Katanga to promote peace, receiving an ecstatic welcome from the Baluba. He encouraged the Baluba to maintain public order and place their confidence in the UN. On the whole his tour improved security in the region, but his presence in Manono from 2‚Äì3 November only heightened tensions in the area. Tshombe denounced him as a \\"public danger\\". While the central government was negotiating the transfer of Lumumba to Katanga (where he would be executed upon arrival), Tshombe repeatedly asked to receive Sendwe. Though initially agreeing to the plan, central government officials later backed away from their commitment. In December Sendwe attended a Francophone-African conference in Brazzaville where foreign diplomats attempted to provide mediation between the Congolese factions. In early 1961 he appealed to the UN to go on another pacification tour of northern Katanga, receiving their approval on 8 January. However, the next day forces of the rival Free Republic of the Congo invaded the area and BALUBAKAT began to organise its own administration of the region as the \\"Province of Lualaba\\". Sendwe attempted to broker a political compromise and secure Belgian political and commercial acceptance of the new province. He celebrated its creation in a tour of the area in February. Meanwhile, he traveled to Belgium in February and in May he participated in the Conference of Coquilhatville, successfully convincing the other Congolese delegates to give recognition to Lualaba. He undertook another pacification trip in July. On 2 August a new government was formed under Cyrille Adoula, and Sendwe was appointed Second Deputy Prime Minister. He was chosen because he was believed to be the only figure with enough clout in Katanga to challenge Tshombe. Other nationalists in Parliament wanted him to assume the premiership, but he preferred to focus his political energies on Katanga instead of the national level, where he had less support. On 28 November a new √©tat d‚Äôexception (state of emergency) was proclaimed by the central government in Katanga and Sendwe was appointed Commissioner-General Extraordinaire for the province, nominally giving him absolute authority over the area. He devoted much of his time to attending to the needs of Baluba in refugee camps in √âlisabethville and Albertville. Between March and July 1962 attempted to negotiate a deal between the central government and the Katangese secessionists, generally taking a moderate stance and even suggesting a reconciliation between BALUBAKAT and CONAKAT. In July he also came into conflict in the pursuance of his responsibilities with fellow BALUBAKAT member Antoine Omari, who had been tasked by the government with reestablishing local administration, as Omari attempted to grant power to local BALUBAKAT members who wanted to split Katanga Province. Over time the central government hardened its attitude against Katanga while Belgium gradually withdrew its support for it. With the secession's prospects weakening, Sendwe hoped to obtain control over the province. Though he had the support of most of the Katanga Baluba and his fellow BALUBAKAT deputies in Parliament, the Adoula Government sought to divide Katanga to weaken it while BALUBAKAT officials in northern Katanga wanted an exclusive polity in the region under the domination of their own party. The Adoula Government also wanted to use Sendwe vis a vis his regional popularity as a counterweight to Tshombe, without granting him control of the entirety of Katanga. = Demise = By the end of 1962 Sendwe was at the peak of his political aspirations, being able to exert great power and influence over the new province of North Katanga (formerly Lualaba). However at 22:00 on 23 December his son became involved in a youth gang street brawl. Sendwe arrived on the scene and ordered some accompanying soldiers to intervene. In the process they beat Senator Pierre Medie, who had come to support his own son. On 28 December in the Senate Sendwe attempted to defend his actions during the street altercation, being frequently interrupted by angry cries from the majority of the senators. Before he was able to complete his defence, they passed a motion of censure against him, 45 votes to four with four abstentions. This formally compelled him to resign as Deputy Prime Minister on 21 January 1963, causing him to withdraw from national to local politics. His departure heralded the removal of the last of the Lumumbists from the government. Sendwe negotiated a deal in 1963 that allowed for the Baluba in the √âlisabethville refugee camp (pictured) to return to their homes. In early 1963 Katanga was reintegrated into the Congo as multiple provinces and Tshombe agreed to cooperate with government officials. Sendwe vied for control of the region, leading to ethnic clashes in Jadotville in April in which approximately 74 people were killed. Nevertheless, he negotiated a deal with Tshombe's Minister of Interior, Godefroid Munongo, to allow for the return of the Baluba in the √âlisabethville refugee camp to their homes. After Tshombe fled the country, Sendwe sought to extend his constituency beyond the Baluba to establish control over the whole of Katanga. He questioned the legality of the existence of North Katanga as a separate political entity and continued to push for the reunification of Katanga Province. However, his removal from the central government and the rejection of his unity proposal by the North Katanga Provincial Assembly forced him to relax his goals. On 18 May the √©tat d‚Äôexception was retracted in Katanga and he was discharged from his post as Commissioner-General Extraordinaire. In July Sendwe moved to Albertville to rebuild his political base. He blocked the repatriation of the Baluba refugees in the local camp, probably so he could use them to boost his support. The Adoula Government was pleased by Sendwe's relocation, wanting to be rid of him in L√©opoldville. Soon after he arrived, rumours emerged that North Katanga Provincial President Mwamba Ilunga had arrested him. This sparked unrest as rural Baluba and customary chiefs began to protest, triggering Mwamba Ilunga's resignation. BALUBAKAT deputies in Parliament lobbied for Sendwe to replace him, and in August a BALUBAKAT party congress‚Äîwith Mwamba Ilunga's acceptance‚Äîruled that Sendwe should be given the provincial presidency. On 21 September the provincial assembly elected Sendwe President of North Katanga Province and invested him with the public health portfolio. The situation in North Katanga under Sendwe quickly turned disastrous, driven by his alcoholism, poor management of public funds, nepotism, lack of a government programme, and numerous attempts to use his position to deprecate his rivals. Problems were exacerbated by the withdrawal of United Nations peacekeeping forces and the occurrence of destructive floods. By the end of the year corruption was rampant, civil servants were receiving compensation on an irregular basis, and much of the population was impoverished. During this time BALUBAKAT also became an increasingly tribal, exclusively Baluba organisation. Sendwe's management of North Katanga perturbed other government officials and Adoula began seeking a way to remove him from office. Fortunat Kabange Numbi, an ally of Adoula and a BALUBAKAT deputy in Parliament, considered a solution with Albertville businessmen that involved granting Sendwe an executive position at a company in exchange for his resignation. This proposal was rejected by Mwamba Ilunga and others, who chose to revise BALUBAKAT's organisation instead. They decided to change the party's name to Parti Progressiste Congolais (PPCo) to distance it from its ethnic connotation and called a congress in January 1964 to vote in new leadership. Sendwe attended the first meeting but then denounced the event and banned it, which was reversed by the intervention of the Deputy Prime Minister. Sendwe lost his seat as party president in a vote, 28‚Äì3. He failed to secure any significant party office, and was instead relegated to the position of adviser to the PPCo. On 15 March the provincial assembly, in a special session sponsored by President Kasa-Vubu, dismissed Sendwe from his post as Provincial President and replaced him with Kabange. Sendwe argued on legal technicality that his removal was unlawful, denounced the PPCo, and declared that only his government had popular support. On 27 April the provincial assembly reached a compromise, re-electing Sendwe President of North Katanga but revising his government, stripping him of the public health portfolio and making Kabange Provincial Vice-President. He was re-inaugurated the following day. He pledged to strengthen North Katanga's institutions and territorial integrity, protect political parties that sought to further \\"superior interests\\" of the Congo, and encourage friendly relations between BALUBAKAT and CONAKAT. He also announced his intention to increase economic cooperation with other provinces and establish cooperatives for merchants and consumers. Meanwhile, a radical leftist BALUBAKAT activist, Laurent-D√©sir√© Kabila, began making plans to launch a rebellion in North Katanga and overthrow Sendwe and Kabange. = Death = On 27 May Simba rebels led by Kabila launched a coup in Albertville, overthrowing Sendwe's government. They accused him of embezzling public funds. Sendwe was immediately detained by the rebels. While rebel leaders debated what to do with him‚Äîsome pressing for him to be shot‚ÄîSendwe escaped. He then spent the next few days trying to reestablish his authority while rebel control crumbled. On 30 May a small government force under the command of Colonel Louis Bobozo recaptured the town and recovered Sendwe‚Äîwho claimed to have been nearly buried alive by the rebels. Sendwe was under the false impression that Mwamba Ilunga had stoked the rebellion and had him arrested. Unrest persisted in Albertville. Sendwe failed to calm the situation and attacked his rivals and non-Baluba ethnicities. On 19 June the population revolted and the government evacuated. Sendwe attempted to flee but was hampered by government troops and was killed by rebels. Questions about his death were raised in several newspapers, and the central government released an official report about it two weeks later. There are various theories about how and why Sendwe was killed. According to journalist Ian Goodhope Colvin, Sendwe drove towards Fizi with an American missionary but his car was stopped by Simba rebels. His police escort fled and he and his companion were murdered. According to Jean Omasombo Tshonda, he was arrested by ANC soldiers at Muswaki while escaping by train and forced to return to Albertville. Driving with several relatives, he went into the city to try and calm the Simbas, assuring them of his Lumumbist credentials by shouting (in a reportedly drunken manner), \\"Lumumba is my brother! Mulele is my brother! All of you, you are my brothers!\\" The rebels did not heed his words and shot him and some of his companions on Kangomba hill. Erik Kennes examined various testimonies. One witness held Saidi Saleh Mukidadi, a local politician, responsible for the death. Kabuya Lumuna Sando concluded that ANC defectors shot Sendwe. Kennes questioned the validity of the latter claim, noting that most ANC elements had retreated from the area and that no other witnesses reported dissident soldiers forming part of the Simbas' ranks. Simba leader Gaston Soumialot accused Mobutu of organising the murder. Other observers believed that the ANC soldiers' actions in Muswaki indicated that the central government was involved. Kabuya, noting the newer clothing worn by the soldiers, posited that the ANC men were really clandestine operatives of the central government. He reasoned that Mobutu, head of the ANC at the time, wanted Sendwe dead so as to make rapprochement with Tshombe easier. There is a rumor that the execution was carried out by several Bayombe under orders from Kabila. Kennes discounted the theory, reasoning that it was unlikely because Kabila did not have Sendwe killed the first time Albertville was seized and was not present when the city fell on 19 June.  Legacy  Throughout his career, Sendwe was the undisputed national figure of the Baluba of Katanga. According to British journalist Ian Goodhope Colvin, Sendwe's death deprived Adoula of a figure who could guarantee him Katangese support, forcing him to welcome Tshombe back into the country. His murder also disillusioned many Baluba in North Katanga with the Simbas' cause, and as a result many abstained from joining their rebellion. BALUBAKAT collapsed in his wake. In November 1966 Mobutu, having become President, posthumously awarded Sendwe for dying \\"in defence of the country's honour\\". An avenue and a hospital in Lubumbashi were named after him. After his death, Sendwe's legacy drifted into obscurity and by the 21st century there was little political memory of him in northern Katanga. The Union des f√©d√©ralistes et des r√©publicains ind√©pendants (UFERI) recalled his legacy in its rhetoric. Due to the party's militant reputation, the public associated UFERI with the violent actions of BALUBAKAT, thus limiting its ability to proliferate a positive image of Sendwe. In 2011 a congress of the \\"Luba People\\" declared that Sendwe was among \\"our valiant martyrs\\".

It stands on the corner of Marion and Cottage streets. After a mid-70s renovation, it now serves as offices for businesses and the state. It has three floors and an attic converted to meeting spaces. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  History  The building was designed by local architect Fred A. Legg,http://www.oregon.gov/oprd/HCD/OHC/docs/marion_salem_historiccontext.pdf and was built in 1909. The architect, Legg, received five percent of the construction costs. This was the first school Legg designed in the region, but he would go on to design more schools for Salem and surrounding cities as far north as Camas, Washington. The land the school is on was bought by the School Board in 1908 for $4,750. A bond measure was passed for Garfield School in March 1909, and construction was completed in October 1909. The building was made with brick, due to concern over the possibility of fire in the old schoolhouse, which was made of wood. It closed in 1973, but was bought a year later and renovated. The Garfield School was added to the National Register of Historic Places in December 1981 Use as a School When this building was constructed, six other schools existed in Salem. The building is the first brick public elementary school in Salem. Two days before the March 1909 bond measure, fire threatened the lives of 550 students at another East Salem school.https://npgallery.nps.gov/nrhp/GetAsset?assetID=2e6e97b1-ef92-48e0-9446-b743cb7302c1 The first principal was Margaret J. Cosper. She believed heavily in discipline. She was known for playing martial music on her Victrola Gramophone while students marched out of classes at noon and the end of the day. She ensured students had access to art, placing photographs of well-known art in the halls of the school, and placing three Italian statues on display. The original floor plan had four major classrooms (one in each corner of the building) on both floors, with small rooms in-between. The Garfield School closed in 1973. Renovation and Use as Office Space Adaptive-use renovation work took place in this building to turn it into office space in 1974, more renovation took place in 1979. This had minimal effect on the inside of the building and instead focused on making the space leasable to offices. To match code, an elevator was added. The playground was turned into a parking lot during the renovation. There are two notable murals inside the building reflect the history of the school.

Private Radoje Ljutovac fought in the First World War in the Serbian Army, and is officially credited with the first shooting down of a military aircraft with Ground-to-Air artillery fire.Mandeep Singh, \\"Baptism Under Fire\\", Vij Books, New Delhi, 2017.  Balkans War  During the Balkan wars in 1912-1913, as a gunner, he contributed to the liberation of Serbia from the Ottoman Empire and the defense of Bulgaria.  First World War  He joined the First World War as a gunner in the Serbian Army and participated in their battles in 1914. During 1915, Serbia was again attacked by the Austro-Hungarian and the German Empire. Ljutovac was placed in the battalion artillery regiment \\"Tanasko Rajic\\", a special unit at the time, operating the newly formed anti-air battery. His regiment, which was located on a hill near Kragujevac Metin, was tasked to defend the area from enemy aircraft, as buildings such as the Military Technical Institute and other important facilities were present in that area.  Downing of the aircraft  On 30 September 1915, before noon, the alarm was sounded and his regiment went into battle stations, three planes approached Kragujevac and dropped their payload of 45 bombs, 16 of which fell on the Military Technical Institute, 9 on the train station, and the rest throughout the town. Serbian soldiers on the ground unsuccessfully tried to down the airplanes with rifle fire and machine gun fire. On the orders of his commanding officer, Ljutovac was waiting with his cannon and he saw the three Austro-Hungarian aircraft with his binoculars. The cannon was not a dedicated anti-aircraft weapon, but a Polish cannon modified by a piece of Turkish equipment captured in 1912. He took aim and fired a shell. The first plane of the group was hit. The aircraft shuddered and started kicking up smoke, and then it crashed to the ground on Prince Peter Street, right next to the house of Obren Jankoviƒá. After the war, he said this of his experience: \\"I believed in my own hand and artillery experience,\\" he said, \\"the plane was pointing towards the target,\\" he said. \\"That's a happy moment.\\" Now, I need to be calm, steady, and my arm is pulled the trigger, a flame came from the barrel, a thick smoke came out of his plane, and then he headed for the ground.\\" After congratulating him on the venture, the commander gave him a horse, which he rode into town to find the burning aircraft. Together with the plane were the burned bodies of the enemy pilots. Ljutovac stood at attention and saluted. The pilots of the downed aircraft were Captain Von Scheffe and his rear/forward gunner Oton Kris. Ljutovac was then decorated with the Order of Karaƒëorƒëe Star with Swords and was promoted to the rank of corporal. Later on the Salonika front Ljutovac was promoted to the rank of sergeant.

History & usage As part of a larger redevelopment of the Melbourne Sports and Entertainment precinct, the Olympic Park Stadium was torn down in 2012. Olympic Park Oval was created in its former location. The oval opened for use on 11 April 2013. The Federal Government and Collingwood Football Club announced in April 2012 the additional construction of indoor community and training facilities on the site. These were opened in October 2015. Olympic Park Oval plays hosts to matches in the VFL. In addition, each of the club's three teams train at the Oval, while administration of the club is conducted in the associated Glasshouse pavilion and the connected Melbourne Sports and Entertainment Centre. It was the primary home ground for in the AFL Women's competition during the 2017 and 2018 seasons. No games were fixtured at the venue for the 2019 season, with Victoria Park taking over as the team's primary home ground. The Oval remains public land and is available for casual use, though the Melbourne Olympic Park Trust restricts use for official training and sporting usage. Design The oval features a grass playing surface in the standard shape for Australian rules football and Cricket. It boasts a two-lane running track around its exterior. For viewing purposes the oval features limited concrete terracing and four light towers for evening play. The associated indoor structure (known as The Glasshouse) is a multi-use community and events space. The building includes a gym, cafe, theater and office space and is internally connected to the older Melbourne Sports and Entertainment Centre.

Andr√©s Bonifacio fought for independence from the politically and socially ruthless colonial rule by Spain. The monument in height with symbolic images and other features known as the \\"Cry of Balintawak\\" is acclaimed as one of the best monuments in the world. Location The monument is located in South Caloocan at a roundabout crossing of four roads, namely Epifanio de los Santos Avenue (EDSA), MacArthur Highway, Samson Road and Avenida Rizal, the old road leading to Manila. History Commemorative plaques The Bonifacio Monument recalls the Philippine Revolution which was spearheaded by Andr√©s Bonifacio who had urged his men to raise against the colonial rule of Spain. His call to take arms against the Spanish rule was given on 23 August 1896, which is widely known as \\"Cry of Pugad Lawin.\\" The cornerstone was formally laid by Aurora Quezon, the wife of Filipino Senate President and later President Manuel L. Quezon. The monument, which was created under the orders of American Governor-General Frank Murphy, was inaugurated on 23 October 1933. It was inaugurated by the Speaker of the House, with much fanfare in a colourful function led by three women from Luzon (of the Women‚Äôs College), Visayas (of the Institute of Women), and Mindanao (of the Centro Escolar de Se√±oritas/Center for Women) with other women representing the eight provinces of Manila, Cavite, Batangas, Bulacan, Pampanga, Tarlac, Nueva Ecija, and Laguna which had participated in the revolution of 1896. It is considered the most symbolic of all the monuments in the country, even grander than Motto Stella. On 30 November 2013, the sesquicentennial of Bonifacio‚Äôs birth and the 80th anniversary of the monument‚Äôs unveiling was celebrated. Features Bronze figures at the base The Bonifacio Monument, which was sculpted by Guillermo Tolentino in 1933, an obelisk, rises to a height of ; the obelisk is made up of five parts representing five aspects of the society, \\"Kataastaasan, Kagalanggalang na Katipunan ng mga Anak ng Bayan (Highest and Most Venerable Association of the Sons of the Nation)\\". It is crowned by a figure with wings representing triumph. Below the vertical pylon 20 figures cast in bronze have been molded over an octagonal shaped plinth, plus one angel of peace at the top. The octagon represents the eight provinces who fought against Spain and also represents eight rays of the Katipunan flag. The plinth is raised in three steps, each step representing the three centuries of Spanish rule. These figures are a representation of the people of Philippines, who faced inequality, agony and suppression under the colonial rule which eventually ended in an armed revolution in 1896. The main central image of the monument holds a bolo, a machete, in the right hand and a gun in the other hand. At the back of the central figure a flag of Katipunan in an unfurled state is depicted. A remarkable feature of the molded images of the human figures is the classic style with detailing marked by realistic expressions reflecting the revolutionary spirit with an \\"upright head and body\\" and with arms spread on the sides. The central obelisk is surrounded by pools of water.

He was the research director at the Military History Research Office (MGFA). Boog was a contributor to several volumes of the seminal work Germany and the Second World War from the MGFA. He was an expert on the Luftwaffe and the German side of the aerial war in Europe during World War II. Boog also wrote for the right-wing, nationalistic newspaper Junge Freiheit and became politically active in the context of debates about the Allied strategic bombing during World War II. Since the early 1990s almost all of his work concentrated on arguing that Nazi Germany did not start bombing of civilians. Education and career Born in 1928 in Merseburg, Horst Boog grew up in Germany. In 1944, he joined the Hitler Youth and trained as a glider pilot. Towards the end of the war, he was drafted into the Volkssturm. Unable to secure a placement for university studies in the difficult economic conditions of post-war Germany, he attended a foreign-language school in Leipzig. Subsequently, Boog worked as a translator at the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg. For the academic year 1949‚Äì50, he received a scholarship as an exchange student at Middlebury College in the United States, where he earned the degree of Bachelor of Arts in history and philosophy. Returning from the U.S., Boog worked at the Federal Intelligence Service. He attended evening classes at the University of Stuttgart in 1950/51 and took unpaid time off to attend classes at the University of Heidelberg. In 1965 he earned his PhD under the guidance of at Heidelbeg; the topic of his dissertation was the career of Ernst Graf zu Reventlow (1869‚Äì1943), a German naval officer, journalist and Nazi politician. He died on 8 January 2016 in Freiburg. Military historian of Nazi Germany Boog joined the Military History Research Office (MGFA) at Freiburg, where he became a senior research director. While at MGFA, Boog initiated the first scientific conference on the German air war of World War II. Boog contributed to several volumes of the seminal work Germany and the Second World War. Since the 1980s, he has been an internationally recognized expert on the Luftwaffe and on the laws of war, such as the right to war (jus ad bellum) and the law of war (jus in bello). In his works he started to identify with the Luftwaffe and he made a divide between the Nazis and British on one hand and \\"respectable Germans\\", writing about \\"brave decisions and personal courage\\" of Wehrmacht General Staff. Benda-Beckmann Bas von Benda-Beckmann is critical of Boog. This Dutch historian criticises Boog for stating the bombings of Guernica, Rotterdam and Warsaw were \\"tactical\\" attacks compared to the \\"terror bombings\\" by the RAF. Beckmann wrote further that Boog asserted that remained the case only until 1942. Professor Richard Overy argues the same case as Boog with respect to the German side, and the attacks on Warsaw, Rotterdam and Guernica. Overy notes that airmen were ordered to avoid civilians leaving the Polish capital. Another airpower scholar, James Corum argues the rules of warfare in 1937 permitted the attack on Guernica and that the town was a legitimate target in supporting ground forces. Corum argues that the Luftwaffe did not have a policy of so-called \\"terror bombing\\", where civilians and civilian infrastructure were targeted. In his writings Benda-Beckmann claimed Boog aimed at portraying Allied bombings of Nazi Germany as equal to Nazi crimes. Boog also wrote for the right-wing, nationalistic newspaper Junge Freiheit and became politically active in the context of debates about the Allied strategic bombing during World War II. In his later writings starting from mid-90s, Benda-Beckmann claimed Boog engaged in criticism of German guilt for Second World War, which he accused of \\"hypersensitivity\\" and claimed that just because Hitler was presented as \\"villain\\" not everything done in his name was presented as \\"wrong\\". Benda-Beckmann also claimed Boog asserted that it was Germany that was \\"victim\\" during Second World War air war and not everything done in Nazi Germany was \\"wrong\\" or \\"evil\\". In doing so he continued a narrative that presented Germans as suffering in Second World War and majority of Germans as \\"respectable\\".

Bibliography The daughter of the bookseller Edvard Julius Marie Jespersen (1831‚Äì1904) and his wife Henriette Klein (1831‚Äì1922), Jespersen was born in Lyngby on 24 January 1867. Raised in Copenhagen with her siblings, from the age of 11 she set her mind on becoming a headmistress. After attending N. Zahle's School, she completed teacher training at N. Zahle's seminary in 1889 and went on to qualify as a school principal in 1891. For the next three years she was not only head of Elisabeth Gad's School but taught women at the Hj√¶lpeforening for kvindelige Haandarbejder under L.I. Brandes. In 1894, she founded Ingrid Jespersen's Girls School in the √òsterbro district of Copenhagen. Starting with only 19 pupils, she extended the school over the following years. In 1897, when there were 100 pupils, new buildings were added followed a series of additional extensions up to 1932. The school was given the status of a gymnasium in 1906, the first students matriculating in 1908. Despite various educational reforms, the institution continued to operate as a private school with Jespersen as principal until 1930. Thereafter she continued as chair of the school board for the remainder of her life. She was responsible for various pedagogical developments: the first physics and chemistry laboratory in a Danish school in 1903, the inclusion of housekeeping in the curriculum, and the first girls' school to include carpentry as part of the matriculation examination. The school was also the first to offer foreign travel for its pupils with trips to Italy, Switzerland and Austria. On the academic front, Jespersen introduced a far more demanding curriculum than that required by the authorities, taking a special interest in covering the main figures of the Modern Breakthrough. She also taught poetry, encouraging her pupils to write verse. Under the pen name Hella S. Lynge, she published two books for schoolgirls: Kursuskammerater (Coursemates, 1894) and Ungdom (Youth, 1896). She also served on various school boards and commissions. Jespersen spent her retirement translating several of Pearl S. Buck's works into Danish. In 1930, she was awarded the Danish Medal of Merit. Ingrid Jespersen died on 22 November 1938 in Uller√∏d, Karlebo Municipality. Her ashes are buried in the cemetery of Egeb√¶ksvang Church, south of Helsing√∏r.

The term was first used in an article on the \\"language situation\\" in Arizona (Voegelin, Voegelin and Schutz, 1967). It was taken up by Einar Haugen, who pioneered a form of linguistics which used the metaphor of an ecosystem to describe the relationships among the diverse forms of language found in the world, and the groups of people who speak them. Description Linguistic ecology is represented by the journal Language Ecology, which describes the field as follows: Linguistic ecology has often been described as a form of ecolinguistics (e.g., in Fill and M√ºhlh√§usler). However, some studies in language ecology refer only to language within a social context and disregard the ecological context of the living ecosystems and physical environment that life depends on, so could be considered to be more sociolinguistic in nature. Tove Skutnabb-Kangas and David Harmon (2018) write that \\"There has been a tendency of many sociolinguists to pay only lip service to the literal sense of ‚Äòecology‚Äô and to focus only on social concerns. They see the ‚Äòeco-‚Äô in ecolinguistics/language ecology as a relationship within and between various languages, speakers of these languages and their sociocultural and economic contexts.\\". Other studies, however, are relevant to ecolinguistics because they describe the association of high linguistic diversity with high biological diversity (see Bastardas-Boada 2002). The relationship between linguistic diversity and biodiversity is claimed to arise since local ecological knowledge is built into local language varieties and threatened if the local language is threatened by a more dominant language (see Skutnabb-Kangas and Harmon 2017, M√ºhlh√§usler 1995).

The game received positive reviews from critics, who called the game fun, with a deep system of gameplay.  Gameplay  Players control a spaceship which lacks weaponry, instead, having to fight by swinging around a mace made of trash particles that are tethered to their ship. The mace can be controlled using by using the ship's own momentum to drag it along behind, and rapidly changing direction to swing it at enemies and obstacles. Different modes and ships can be unlocked by performing better in the game, including Light and Heavy versions. Development Earlier in its development, the player's ship was capable of shooting, and had a shield that operated similarly to the mace in the current version of the game. Andy Wallace, the game's designer, decided that the shooting was not as fun as the more original physics-based shield mechanic, so he removed it, and changed the shield into a weapon.  Reception  Particle Mace was well-received by critics, with an aggregate score of 87/100 on Metacritic for the iOS version. Tommy Daniels of DarkZero rated the game 10/10, saying that the game \\"lovingly embraces the influences of the 1980s\\" and \\"ends up being a pure delight.\\" Carter Dotson of TouchArcade rated the game 5/5 stars, calling the iOS version \\"well worth the wait\\" and the combat system \\"fun to play with\\", and said he could \\"see himself playing [it] for a long time to come\\".

Rampart in the background The well Terningen Skanse is a small fortification, a schanze. It is situated approximately 2 km west of Elverum town centre, Elverumsleiret, in Hedmark, in south west Norway. It guards the small river \\"Terningen\\", and was constructed as a defence against the Swedes.Kavli,Guthorm (1987) Norges festninger (Oslo: Universitetsforlaget) River Terningen and Terningen Skanse also lends its name to the current Norwegian army camp, situated about 50 m away; Terningmoen.  History  = 1673‚Äì1742 = The fortification was planned by King Christian V of Denmark- Norway and Statholder (viceroy) to Norway, Ulrik Fredrik Gyldenl√∏ve. Generall√∏ytnant (Lieutenant-General) Rusenstein was in 1671 appointed the task of planning fortifications in the Elverum aeria. In 1673 Lieutenant Anthony Coucheron got the task of detail planning of two schanzes west of Elverum. One of these being Terningen skanse which should control the crossing of Terningen river and a nearby crossroad. The fortification was finished in 1675 being about 25*25m with a defense line of 250 m closer to the river. In addition to infantry, the schanze received three 3-pound cannons from Akershus fortress. The first commander was kaptein Jacob Michelet from Opplandske infanteriregiment. After the end of the Scanian War, the fortification was manned until April 1680. In 1683 the work with a stronger fortification, Hammersberget skanse in Elverum started, and Terningen decaded. In 1742 it was abandoned. = 1811‚Äì1814 = During the Napoleonic Wars there was some hostilities between Denmark‚ÄìNorway and Sweden in 1808 and Terningen was again commissioned. The reconstruction was under the direction of Frederik of Hesse and the size now grew to 125*125m. The construction was a square with a bastion in each corner forming a star fort with ramparts and a dry moat. Along the Contrescarpe there was a palisade. The bridge over the moat could be withdrawn. Inside the rampart was set up four log buildings around an inner court yard with a well in the center. The buildings held barracks for officers and men, stables, kitchen and storehouse. The work in the area started in 1811 under lieutenant (ing) Vosgraff. Later under kaptein (ing) von Purgau. The work was finished in 1814. Terningen also has two redoubts. One is named St√∏rch-Glads redoubt, now within Terningmoen camp. The other is situated on a height, 334 ell west of the Terningen. After the Napoleonic Wars Terningen was again abandoned. On 2. August 2014 the Terningen skanse was given Heritage protection.Heritage protection ceremony]  References   External links  * Se fotos and model of the schanze in DigitaltMuseum Fortifications in Norway Elverum ","title":"Terningen skanse"},{"id":"52807521","text":"Refik is a masculine given name of Arabic origin meaning friend, associate, husband, companion or fellow.

It compiles declarative regular expression specifications to deterministic finite automata. Originally written by Peter Bumbulis and described in his paper, re2c was put in public domain and has been since maintained by volunteers. It is the lexer generator adopted by projects such as PHP, SpamAssassin, Ninja build system and others. Together with the Lemon parser generator, re2c is used in BRL-CAD. This combination is also used with STEPcode, an implementation of ISO 10303 standard.http://stepcode.github.io/docs/build_process/  Philosophy  The main goal of re2c is generating fast lexers: at least as fast as reasonably optimized C lexers coded by hand. Instead of using traditional table-driven approach, re2c encodes the generated finite state machine directly in the form of conditional jumps and comparisons. The resulting program is faster than its table-driven counterpart and much easier to debug and understand. Moreover, this approach often results in smaller lexers, as re2c applies a number of optimizations such as DFA minimization and the construction of tunnel automaton. Another distinctive feature of re2c is its flexible interface: instead of assuming a fixed program template, re2c lets the programmer write most of the interface code and adapt the generated lexer to any particular environment. The main idea is that re2c should be a zero-cost abstraction for the programmer: using it should never result in a slower program than the corresponding hand-coded implementation.  Features  * Submatch extraction: re2c supports both POSIX-compliant capturing groups and standalone tags (with leftmost greedy disambiguation and optional handling of repeated submatch). The implementation is based on the lookahead-TDFA algorithm. * Encoding support: re2c supports ASCII, UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32, UCS-2 and EBCDIC. * Flexible user interface: the generated code uses a few primitive operations in order to interface with the environment (read input characters, advance to the next input position, etc.); users can redefine these primitives to whatever they need. * Storable state: re2c supports both pull-model lexers (when lexer runs without interrupts and pulls more input as necessary) and push-model lexers (when lexer is periodically stopped and resumed to parse new chunks of input). * Start conditions: re2c can generate multiple interrelated lexers, where each lexer is triggered by a certain condition in program. * Self- validation: re2c has a special mode in which it ignores all used-defined interface code and generates a self-contained skeleton program. Additionally, re2c generates two files: one with the input strings derived from the regular grammar, and one with compressed match results that are used to verify lexer behavior on all inputs. Input strings are generated so that they extensively cover DFA transitions and paths. Data generation happens right after DFA construction and prior to any optimizations, but the lexer itself is fully optimized, so skeleton programs are capable of revealing any errors in optimizations and code generation. * Warnings: re2c performs static analysis of the program and warns its users about possible deficiencies or bugs, such as undefined control flow, unreachable code, ill-formed escape symbols and potential misuse of the interface primitives. * Debugging. Besides generating human-readable lexers, re2c has a number of options that dump various intermediate representations of the generated lexer, such as NFA, multiple stages of DFA and the resulting program graph in DOT format.  Syntax  re2c program can contain any number of \`/*!re2c ... */\` blocks. Each block consists of a sequence of rules, definitions and configurations (they can be intermixed, but it is generally better to put configurations first, then definitions and then rules). Rules have the form \`REGEXP { CODE }\` or \`REGEXP := CODE;\` where \`REGEXP\` is a regular expression and \`CODE\` is a block of C code. When \`REGEXP\` matches the input string, control flow is transferred to the associated \`CODE\`. There is one special rule: the default rule with \`*\` instead of \`REGEXP\`; it is triggered if no other rules matches. re2c has greedy matching semantics: if multiple rules match, the rule that matches longer prefix is preferred; if the conflicting rules match the same prefix, the earlier rule has priority. Definitions have the form \`NAME = REGEXP;\` (and also \`NAME { REGEXP }\` in Flex compatibility mode). Configurations have the form \`re2c:CONFIG = VALUE;\` where \`CONFIG\` is the name of the particular configuration and \`VALUE\` is a number or a string. For more advanced usage see the official re2c manual.  Regular expressions  re2c uses the following syntax for regular expressions: *\`\\"foo\\"\` case-sensitive string literal *\`'foo'\` case-insensitive string literal *\`[a-xyz]\`, \`[^a-xyz]\` character class (possibly negated) *\`.\` any character except newline *\`R \\\\ S\` difference of character classes *\`R*\` zero or more occurrences of \`R\` *\`R+\` one or more occurrences of \`R\` *\`R?\` optional \`R\` *\`R{n}\` repetition of \`R\` exactly \`n\` times *\`R{n,}\` repetition of \`R\` at least \`n\` times *\`R{n,m}\` repetition of \`R\` from \`n\` to \`m\` times *\`(R)\` just \`R\`; parentheses are used to override precedence or for POSIX-style submatch *\`R S\` concatenation: \`R\` followed by \`S\` *\`R  S\` alternative: \`R\` or \`S\` *\`R / S\` lookahead: \`R\` followed by \`S\`, but \`S\` is not consumed *\`name\` the regular expression defined as \`name\` (except in Flex compatibility mode) *\`@stag\` an s-tag: saves the last input position at which \`@stag\` matches in a variable named \`stag\` *\`#mtag\` an m-tag: saves all input positions at which \`#mtag\` matches in a variable named \`mtag\` Character classes and string literals may contain the following escape sequences: \`\\\\a\`, \`\\\\b\`, \`\\\\f\`, \` \`, \`\\\\r\`, \`\\\\t\`, \`\\\\v\`, \`\\\\\\\\\`, octal escapes \`\\\\ooo\` and hexadecimal escapes \`\\\\xhh\`, \`\\\\uhhhh\` and \`\\\\Uhhhhhhhh\`.  Example  Here is a very simple program in re2c (example.re). It checks that all input arguments are hexadecimal numbers. The code for re2c is enclosed in comments \`/*!re2c ... */\`, all the rest is plain C code. See the official re2c website for more complex examples. #include static int lex(const char *YYCURSOR) { const char *YYMARKER; /*!re2c re2c:define:YYCTYPE = char; re2c:yyfill:enable = 0; end = \\"\\\\x00\\"; hex = \\"0x\\" [0-9a-fA-F]+; * { printf(\\"err \\"); return 1; } hex end { printf(\\"hex \\"); return 0; } */ } int main(int argc, char **argv) { for (int i = 1; i < argc; ++i) { lex(argv[i]); } return 0; } Given that, \`re2c -is -o example.c example.re\` generates the code below (example.c). The contents of the comment \`/*!re2c ... */\` are substituted with a deterministic finite automaton encoded in the form of conditional jumps and comparisons; the rest of the program is copied verbatim into the output file. There are several code generation options; normally re2c uses \`switch\` statements, but it can use nested \`if\` statements (as in this example with \`-s\` option), or generate bitmaps and jump tables. Which option is better depends on the C compiler; re2c users are encouraged to experiment. /* Generated by re2c 1.2.1 on Fri Aug 23 21:59:00 2019 */ #include static int lex(const char *YYCURSOR) { const char *YYMARKER; { char yych; yych = *YYCURSOR; if (yych  '0') goto yy4; ++YYCURSOR; yy3: { printf(\\"err \\"); return 1; } yy4: yych = *(YYMARKER = ++YYCURSOR); if (yych != 'x') goto yy3; yych = *++YYCURSOR; if (yych >= 0x01) goto yy8; yy6: YYCURSOR = YYMARKER; goto yy3; yy7: yych = *++YYCURSOR; yy8: if (yych <= '@') { if (yych <= 0x00) goto yy9; if (yych <= '/') goto yy6; if (yych <= '9') goto yy7; goto yy6; } else { if (yych <= 'F') goto yy7; if (yych <= '\`') goto yy6; if (yych <= 'f') goto yy7; goto yy6; } yy9: ++YYCURSOR; { printf(\\"hex \\"); return 0; } } } int main(int argc, char **argv) { for (int i = 1; i < argc; ++i) { lex(argv[i]); } return 0; }  See also  * Comparison of parser generators  References   External links  * Compiling tools Public-domain software Lexical analysis ","title":"Re2c"},{"id":"52807528","text":"Prysock is a surname.

He became close to the members of the Cobra movement. He devotes various articles to painters like Guillaume Corneille or Asger Jorn, before drafting a more comprehensive study of the logograms by Christian Dotremont in 1975. He also worked with Pierre Alechinsky who helped him to publish one of his last texts, L'√âpreuve. His philosophy takes root in phenomenology, from which he tries to rehabilitate the body. He starts from a genetic approach in which he tries to rethink the origin of the phenomenon as the genesis of the apparition. In Cri (Shout), he inaugurates a radical style from which he describes the effect of rupture, tearing and the void that emerges from the shout. This uncovering of the experience of language invites us to redefine the emergence of the apparition and show how the view resumes its bearings and reconstitutes a world. Starting from a critique of the Platonic vision, which fundamentally denies the body, since it is idealized as a vision of ideas, this path leads Loreau to rethink a new beginning of the body, vision and language. Max Loreau also published various poems under the titles Cerceaux s'orcellent, Chants de la perp√©tuelle venue and Florence port√©e aux nues.

This is not entirely impossible, though highly unlikely.

The Torres D√≠ez de la Cortina relatives made their name developing the bull-breeding business and gained acknowledgement in the late 19th century.the ganaderia was sold in the late 19th century, see Garc√≠a Jim√©nez, Hermanos entry, [in:] ganaderias.toroslidia service, available here Rafael's distant relative was Jos√© G√≥mez Acebo y Cortina, a conservative politician who held various ministerial jobs during final years of the Restoration. The Carlist title of Conde de Olaeta, conferred upon Rafael in 1876, was claimed by Mariano Ternero Caro in 2002,Revista Hidalgu√≠a 296 (2003), p. 7 but has not been recognized by the Madrid court so far. Soldier Carlist subjects, 1872 There is no information on political preferences of the D√≠ez de la Cortina until the mid-19th century;during the First Carlist War Marchena was briefly taken by the Carlists but there is no note of any D√≠ez de la Cortina involved; later on the alcalde claimed in report to higher authorities that there were no Carlist supporters in the area, Alcaide 1999, pp. 46-47 in the 1860s various members of the family, including Jos√© D√≠ez de la Cortina Cerrato, his wife and sons, started to appear as signatories of various open letters printed in Neo-Catholic and Traditionalist papers; they pledged loyalty to the Catholic Church and lambasted \\"corrupci√≥n de las ideas y de costumbres\\", especially in education.El Pensamiento Espa√±ol 13.07.64, available here Later his son recollected that it was the 1868 revolution and its aftermath which triggered D√≠ez de la Cortina Cerrato's access to Carlism;Jos√© D√≠ez de la Cortina, El fracaso de un plan, [in:] Tradici√≥n 16 (1933), p. 387 in 1870 he already declared his \\"completa adhesi√≥n al se√±or Duque de Madrid\\".La Regeneraci√≥n 25.05.70, available here When the Carlist insurgency rocked Vasco-Navarrese provinces in 1872 he pondered upon joining the rebels, the idea which soon became his obsession.D√≠ez de la Cortina 1933, p. 387 In June 1873 the 17-year-old Rafael's brother Jos√© was dispatched North to agree the logistics and learn the war craft.D√≠ez de la Cortina 1933, pp. 387-388 Upon his return to Marchena in October 1873 Cortina Cerrato formed a family-based group, consisting of the father, Rafael and his two brothers, his cousin, few family associates including a chaplain and a lawyer, some servants and a handful of volunteers.B. de Artagan [Reinaldo Brea], Principe hero√≠co y su soldados leales, Barcelona 1912, p. 118 The 20-men unit, of which Rafael was the youngest member, headed North.D√≠ez de la Cortina 1933, p. 388, Ferrer 1955, p. 175 In two weeks they covered some 350 kilometers across the provinces of C√≥rdoba, Ja√©n, Ciudad Real and C√°ceres, finally joining the 300-men columnalmost all of them cavalry, Ferrer 1955, p. 168 of general Vicente Sabariegos.D√≠ez de la Cortina 1933, p. 389 with brothers and cousin Surrounded by family members, starting November Cortina commenced combat during failed skirmishes at Retamosa; upon death of Sabariegos, command was assumed by general Villar y Perez.

Memorias de su secretario, Madrid 1940, pp. 62‚Äì63 one author notes that no tangible results of his political mission in the US are known.\\"no conocemos resultados tangibles de su actividad\\", Melchor Ferrer, Historia del tradicionalismo espa√±ol, vol. 28/1, Sevilla 1959, p. 231 It seems that Cortina was most active in 1896‚Äì1898, during the run-up to the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Busy in the Hispanic New York communitysome authors claim he contributed to development of Hispanic theatre in the United States; two plays issued by his publishing house as auxiliary materials to learn Spanish, Despu√©s la lluvia el sol (1879) and El indiano (1893) are attributed to him with a reservation that there is no indication any of them has ever been staged, Nicol√°s Kanellos, A History of Hispanic Theatre in the United States: Origins to 1940, Austin 1990, , pp. 104-105, 215 and contributing to a daily Las Novedades,full title Las Novedades. Espa√±a y los Pueblos Hispano-Americanos, a review issued between 1877 and 1905. For detailed discussion of this and other Hispanic papers in New York see Vernon A. Chamberlin, Ivan A. Schulman, La Revista Ilustrada de Nueva York, New York 1976 he tried to confront the anti-Spanish frenzy of American press and complained about lack of assistance on part of Madrid, the charges which thanks to V√°zquez de Mella reached the Cortes and the government in 1896.El Correo Espa√±ol 18.08.96, available here Following a visit in Spain,he returned to New York in September 1896, NARA rolls T715 and M237, available online at FamilySearch service here starting 1897 Cortina changed the tone of his press endeavors; he switched to advertising the claims of Carlos VII. Thanks to his efforts few US periodicals, including New York Herald, published pieces on Carlism.see To crown Carlos, [in:] New York Herald 19.09.97, referred after El Regional 15.10.97, available here Some quoted Cortina say that 100,000 volunteers waited for an order to rise and that by January 1, 1898, Don Carlos would assume the throne, though also that the claimant would do nothing which might impair international standing of his country.see e.g. Kansas City Journal 03.10.97, available here 431 Riverside Drive (building left) In May 1898, in the midst of virulent anti-Spanish press campaign, a number of papers quoted interviews with Cortina and discussed Carlist claims as proof that the Madrid government might fall any minute. Headlineslike \\"For Thirty Years He and His Followers Have Been Striving to Take Advantage of Just Such a Crisis in Spanish Affairs\\", The San Francisco Call 08.05.98, available hhere and narrationlike \\"it is believed there is a plot to overthrow the Spanish dynasty at once\\", The Brownsville Daily Harald 07.05.98, available here helped to mobilize the American public opinion, though certainly this was not Cortina's intention.already in 1889, upon his first passport application, he signed a standard declaration that \\"I will support, protect and defend the Constitution and Government of the United States against all enemies, whether domestic or foreign; and that I will bear true faith, allegiance and loyalty to the same, any ordinance, resolution or law of any State, Convention or Legislature to the contrary notwithstanding\\", NARA rolls M1490 and M1372, available online at FamilySearch service here In May 1898 he transferred the realization of his prediction to June 1, 1898,The San Francisco Call 08.05.98 called the Carlists of America to join the claimant and declared he would travel to Europe shortly.Albuquerque Daily Citizen 07.05.98, available here It is not clear whether he did indeed; one source claims vaguely that he \\"took part in the 1898-1899 conspiracy.\\"and was even promoted to \\"coronel en la conspiraci√≥n de 1898-1899\\", Ferrer 1955 (25), p. 175 He might have been involved in shipment of arms to Carlist conspirators, though nature of his engagement is highly unclear. In 1901 a Spanish military attach√© in Washington reported to Madrid that Cortina helped him identify a cargo of 5,000 rifles, sent from New York to Lisbon and intended for a Carlist depot in Badajoz.\\"En III/IV-1901, el agregado militar de la embajada espa√±ola en Washington, Federico de Monteverde, localiz√≥ a trav√©s del confidente Rafael D√≠az [note different spelling, which is probably irrelevant anyway] de la Cortina un presunto alijo de 5.000 fusiles Remington que eran enviados desde enero con destino a Lisboa y Badajoz (cartas de Monteverde al Ministerio de Guerra, 30-III y 9, 12 y 19-IV-1901, en SHM, Archivo General Militar, 2a Secci√≥n, 4a Divisi√≥n, leg. 125: Orden p√∫blico: Movimiento carlista, 1837-1906 y carta del embajador en Washington, 20-IV-1901, en AMAE, Pol√≠tica Interior, leg.

Though also in the 20th century Cortina frequently visited Spain,at least in 1905, 1908, 1910, 1913, 1929, 1930, 1934, 1935. When in Spain he used to give lectures on languages, compare Nuevo Diario de Badajoz 25.01.05, available here he was hardly reported as engaged in Carlist activities,the thread identified was his engagement in building a monument to Juan Vazqyez de Mella. In 1930 he donated money, see La Epoca 01.01.30, available here, and in 1934 he was present in Cangas de Oniz attending a feast related to unveiling of the bust, El Siglo Futuro 24.08.34, available here focused on promotion of his linguistic business.though until death he publicly used the \\"Count of Olaeta\\" title, at least in the United States, and this is how he was also referred to in the press, see e.g. Middletown Times Herald 24.06.39, available here During resurgence of Carlism in the 1930s he was not mentioned in party propaganda.e.g. a luxury 1933 publication celebrating a centenary of Carlism published a brief note on his father, his brother and his cousin, but contained no mention of Rafael, see [Juan Mar√≠a Roma], Album historico del Carlismo, Barcelona 1933 Linguist and businessman Edison and phonograph In the early 1880s Cortina commenced teaching Spanish. His own marketingThe Evening Post 30.09.93, available here and independent reviews alikeCortina Looks Towards Racks, [in:] Billboard 25.04.64, p. 6, available here claimed that Cortina Institute of Languages was set up in 1882. Throughout the 1880s he was rather noted as giving lessonsthough apparently he already made his name as a teacher; 1886 he had his apartment at 131 West Street 31 robbed, including money and business cards; the burglar later pretended to be him before apprehended, The Sun 15.10.86, available here offered by other institutions, e.g. in 1887 by Brooklyn LibraryThe Brooklyn Daily Eagle 30.10.87, available here or in 1889 by Brooklyn YMCA.The Brooklyn Daily Eagle 14.10.89, available here The breakthrough work which helped him launch own business was the 1889 publication titled The Cortina Method to Learn Spanish in Twenty Lessons.Carl G. Franz√©n, Foreign Language in the Curriculum, [in:] Bulletin of the School of Education Indiana University 34 (1958), p. 17, referred after Patricia Sue Bryant, A Study of the Development of Secondary School Modern Language Programs in the United States [MA thesis Kansas State University], Manhattan 1965, p. 23 Instead of systematically mastering linguistic structures, deemed laborious and inefficient,he wrote: \\"It is a well-known fact that, by the old methods of study, only a few students obtain any degree of fluency in speaking a language that is foreign to them. It is true th t many of them can, after a number of years spent in study, conjugate, decline, analyze, and perhaps translate a sentence into English, but they are seldom able to put an English sentence into an idiomatic foreign one. Such learning, although laboriously acquired, is of little practical value, end the tourist or commercial traveller finds himself in an awkward dilemma when forced to ask for even the everyday necessaries of life in a foreign tongue\\", quoted after Bryant 1965, p. 24 Cortina - claiming to be M.A. graduate of University of MadridThe Evening Post 18.10.90, available here  focused on practical skills. In 1891 he was already boasting a program based on \\"the Cortina method\\",The Evening Post 10.10.91, available here and in 1892 the Cortina School of Languages started to advertise.The Brooklyn Daily Eagle 09.10.92, available here Indeed, it seems to have been an established business already. Set in two locations in Brooklyn and Manhattan, the school offered 9 languages,not only Spanish but also English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Latin and Greek taught in 20 lessons by native instructors.The Brooklyn Daily Eagle 09.10.92, available here It is not clear whether from the onset \\"the Cortina method\\" entailed mechanically-aided learning. Some claim that already in the mid-1880s Cortina experimented with phonograph recordings, possibly in co-operation with Thomas Edison.Kenji Kitao, The History of Language Laboratories. Origin and Establishment [working paper of Doshisha University], Kyoto 1995, p. 5 It was in 1893 that his method was reported in The Phonogram, an academic journal,Kitao 1995, p. 6 and he became the first person to use phonograph for foreign language instruction.Kitao 1995, pp. 6-7 It soon became a second leg of his business, as on-site learning was paired with development of self-learning correspondence courses and production of related aid materials. They consisted of two types. One was own textbooks; they contained excerpts from literary works,perhaps the first to be named are two plays he fathered himself: Despues de la lluvia el sol (comedy in 1 act) and El Indiano (comedy in 3 acts inspired by Ricardo Garc√≠a de la Vega). The remaining ones are novels (Amparo by Enrique P√©rez Escrich), collections of stories (El Final de Norma by Alarc√≥n, Temprano y con sol, forwarded by Emilia Pardo Baz√°n, El Molinerillo) or brief accounts of historical events from Spanish history (Episodios en espa√±ol y anotados en ingl√©s). They were edited in Spanish and English on opposing pages, most of them published by his own publishing house, R. D. Cortina Company though also phrases tailored for daily usage.most are styled after his first highly successful Spanish in Twenty Lessons: Ingl√©s en Veinte Lecciones, French in Twenty Lessons, Franc√©s en Veinte Lecciones, Espa√±ol en Espa√±ol, English in English, Francais en Francais, Deutsch auf Deutsch, Italiano in Italiano, English in English with Key in Portuguese. Another category were dictionaries, like Verbos espa√±oles: diccionario de la conjugaci√≥n castellana, Cortina‚Äôs Spanish-English and English-Spanish Vest Pocket Dictionary and Instructor. Finally, he published letter-writing guides, best known Modelo para cartas en espa√±ol (with prologue by V√°zquez de Mella). He reacted to ongoing events quickly and demonstrated lots of flexibility. When the American troops landed on European shores in 1917, he had already published Cortina French-English Military Manual, Cortina French-English Military Dictionary, Cortina French-English Red Cross Instructor and Cortina Soldier‚Äôs Map of the French Front and Handy War Guide for My Company, compare Jean A. Picard, Cortina French-English Military Manual, New York 1917, p. 278 Another one was recordings. Initially phonograph-intended cylinders were used;Kitao 1995, p. 6 first branded by Cortina, after 1896 they were made by Edison's National Phonographic Company.Kitao 1995, pp. 6-7 In 1908 he registered the trademark of Cortinaphone, selling own brand of phonograph, and since 1913 his company started to issue flat round recordings.Kitao 1995, p. 6 The Cortina school kept using English for instruction until 1920, when they switched to target language only.Kitao 1995, pp. 6-7 Around 1920 he was marketing \\"Cortina phonograph outfit\\", advertised as more efficient than teaching by instructors.Picard 1917, p. 276 Cortinaphone advert, 1910 Cortina's language business proved rather successful.though already in the late 1890s Cortina was by no means the single company offering recording-aided correspondence courses on the US market. Similar business was developed by Richard S. Rosenthal as The Meisterschaft System (later dubbed also Rosenthal Method and Language Phone Method) and by Thomas J.

Through these festivals and their giants, this concerns the set of gigantic manifestations specific to each country. In the case of Belgium, these are the festivities of Dendermonde (Ommegang van Dendermonde), Mechelen (Ommegang van Mechelen), Mons (the Ducasse de Mons, and the fight which is named the \\"Lume√ßon\\"), Ath (the Ducasse d'Ath) and Brussels (the Meyboom). For France, these are the feasts at Douai (feasts of Gayant) and Cassel (carnival) and the totemic animals and their celebrations in Tarascon and P√©zenas (Mardi Gras, inauguration of the Mirondela dels Arts on the first Sunday in July). This proclamation allows for a valorisation of these popular festivals and their protection. The processional giant is a gigantic figure that represents a fictitious or real being. Inherited from medieval rites, tradition has it that it is carried, and that it dances in the streets during processions or festivals. Its physiognomy and size are variable, and its name-giving varies according to the regions; among the Flemings, it is known by the name of Reuze, among the Picards it is called Gayant.

Their appearance dates back to the 15th century; Goliath of Nivelles, which is mentioned as early as 1457, is the oldest known Belgian giant.Nivelles Tourism website, about Nivelles' Goliath The Belgians also have the largest giant in Europe, Jean Turpin of Nieuwpoort, which exceeds 11 meters.

She is pretending to date a former Nazi general named Dieter Skul who was believed to have been killed during the war, but is alive and acting as a part of this plot. The general gets suspicious when he finds the Phantom snooping in his bedroom, but she flirts her way out of trouble. Meanwhile, Geoffrey Sydenham is in Wakanda to develop a covert diplomatic relationship between the African nation and the United States, though it becomes apparent that all is not as it seems. After surviving an attempt on his life, Nick Fury arrives home to find Powell McTeague there wishing to speak with him. McTeague reveals that he was sent by General Hill to give Fury unofficial orders to travel to Hassenstadt in Latveria in order to continue his secret war against surviving Nazi war criminals. In Hassenstadt, he meets his friend Eric Koenig, now an American diplomat to Latveria, and introduces him to the Blonde Phantom. She reveals that she was dating the General as a means of finding out more information about a possible large-scale Nazi plot before she was caught eavesdropping. The Wakandan Ambassador to Latveria also reveals that their prince T'Chaka was kidnapped and he believes it to be the work of the same people that Fury is chasing. In Washington D.C., General Hill and his men investigate a possible Nazi safe-house. The occupants appeared to have been tipped off, however, as the house is booby-trapped, killing Hill's men. Geoffrey Sydenham is unnoticed as he slinks away from the crime scene. Fury and the Phantom go to check out a hideout that was mentioned in one of Skul's files, finding the Hollow Men, mindless Nazi zombies, inside. Fury manages to blow up the building before he and the Phantom disappear into the shadows. The rest of the Avengers find themselves teleported aboard a ship in the South China Sea by Powell McTeague. The ship is led by the Nazi war criminals Baron Blood and Brain Drain who the Avengers immediately attack. After defeating them, the Nazis are transported away by Geoffrey Sydenham who wants to recruit them into his own army. In Washington D.C., Senator Sanford and Sydenham attempt to sway General Hill to their way of thinking, but the General storms out of the room, calling them insane after Sydenham insinuates that America and the Nazis should have been allies during World War II. Nick Fury and the Blonde Phantom steal a Latverian fighter plane in order to leave the country without being seen on a commercial flight. Traveling to Wakanda, the pair are given information that should lead them to General Skul, borrowing Howard Stark's hydrofoil to get there as quickly as possible. During their journey, however, they come under attack by the Ubermadchen, but are quickly saved by the rest of the Avengers who happen by just in time thanks to Powell McTeague's magic. The Avengers interrogate the Ubermadchen before allowing Sabretooth to kill them. The team then travels to the island of Madripoor where they discover a mansion headquarters belonging to their enemies. The Avengers raid the mansion, capturing the strategist known as Innsbruck the Planner. From him the team learns of General Skul's attack on the technologically advanced nation of Wakanda. Utilizing Powell McTeague's teleportation abilities, the group are able to get to Wakanda just in time to battle Skul's men. Sydenham and Sanford again try to recruit General Hill to their cause, but are rejected outright by the General. That night an assassin is teleported to the General's bedside as he lies asleep. A watching Gorilla-Man (Ken Hale), however, saves the General's life. The two investigate the dead man's body only to discover that he has been dead for several days rather than minutes. The Avengers defeat ICON's forces who are attempting to attack Wakanda, before teleporting to Washington D.C. where they confront ICON's leader, Geoffrey Sydenham and the rest of his operatives. After taking down Brain Drain, Baron Blood, Geist, Spider Queen (Shannon Kane), and the Hollow Men, they take Sydenham into custody. The Avengers each go their separate ways shortly after defeating the terrorist organization with Nick Fury's thanks. Shortly after his, Fury and McTeague discover that Sydenham has been released in exchange for his cooperation in locating the missing Wakandan prince T'Chaka. Sydenham is later seen in Greenwich Village continuing his use of the dark arts.

Williamson (June 4, 1918January 28, 2007) was a United States Army Major General who served in World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War. He led the 173rd Airborne Brigade, the first US Army unit to deploy to South Vietnam and later commanded the 25th Infantry Division there. Early life and education Williamson was born in Raeford, North Carolina on 4 June 1918. During high school he joined the 120th Infantry Regiment, part of the North Carolina National Guard. Williamson graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from Atlantic Christian College in 1940. Career World War II Williamson was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in March 1941 and with the US entry into World War II, the 120th Infantry was federalised and sent for overseas service. In January 1945 Williamson, now a Lieutenant Colonel led the 1st Battalion of the 120th Infantry during the Battle of the Bulge. Post World War II Williamson graduated from the Command and General Staff College in 1950 and was assigned to the headquarters of X Corps in Korea. Korean War As the Assistant Operations Officer of X Corps, Williamson participated in the Inchon landings. Post Korean War Williamson took command of the 13th Infantry Regiment at Fort Carson, Colorado, in 1956. In 1959 he was appointed Chief of the Training Division, Headquarters, 7th U.S. Army. He then attended the National War College. Williamson was promoted to Brigadier General in 1963. On 26 March 1963, Williamson was appointed to command the newly activated 173rd Airborne Brigade (Separate) on Okinawa, which was to serve as the quick reaction force or \\"fire brigade\\" for the Pacific Command. For over 2 years Williamson trained the 173rd on Okinawa focusing on airborne techniques with an emphasis on jungle warfare, enhanced by training in the Philippines, Thailand and Taiwan. Vietnam War MG Ellis Williamson fires a 105mm howitzer On 7 May 1965 Williamson led the 173rd Airborne Brigade in its deployment to South Vietnam, becoming the first major US Army ground combat unit to deploy there. The 173rd was originally assigned to protect Bien Hoa Air Base and the base area at Vung Tau. On arrival at Bien Hoa the 173rd trained in airmobile warfare using the 3 UH-1 helicopters assigned to the Brigade. In mid-May the 173rd commenced combat operations against the Viet Cong. In June Williamson assumed control of the newly arrived 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment and the 161st Battery, Royal New Zealand Artillery. From 28 June to 2 August the 173rd conducted a sweep operation near the Rung Sat Special Zone which failed to locate any Viet Cong. This operation prompted Associated Press correspondent Peter Arnett to write a story stating \\"There appeared to be a chain reaction of mistakes that decreed success virtually impossible even before the operation got fully underway. Many observers feel that the U.S. high command may be embarked on a strategy that brought failure to Vietnamese forces before and could bring failure to U.S. forces now.\\" According to Arnett this story infuriated Williamson who summoned him to his headquarters for a dressing down where he reports Williamson stating that \\"Don't you know that the VC are cowards, they fight only at night and when we catch a bunch of them together they run away\\" and he urged Arnett to \\"get on the team\\" reporting positively on U.S. actions. In October 1965, the 173rd launched Operation 25-65 in the Iron Triangle which resulted in little action. Williamson stated that \\"the Iron Triangle has been... for all practical purposes destroyed\\". He also claimed that the operation proved that American forces could \\"go and stay anywhere and anytime in Vietnam\\". In November 1965, the 173rd launched Operation Hump at the conclusion of which the unit claimed that they had killed over 400 Vietcong, a figure which was acknowledged to be a guess by Williamson given under pressure from General Westmoreland at Military Assistance Command, Vietnam. Williamson later stated that his forces had \\"beat the living hell\\" out of the Vietcong, but acknowledged that the battle had only come about because the Vietcong had lured the Americans into a battle at a time and place of their choosing. While Williamson was confident in the search and destroy strategy, an Australian officer expressed doubts in his approach saying that Williamson \\"had a dangerous contempt for the guerilla and little understanding of the Viet Cong's objectives or how he fights.\\" In February 1966, Williamson was appointed assistant commander of United States Army Infantry School at Fort Benning, Georgia. He was later promoted to Major General and on 1 November 1966 was given command of the Advanced Infantry Training Center (\\"Tigerland\\") at Fort Polk, Louisiana. Returning to Vietnam, on 3 August 1968 Williamson took command of the 25th Infantry Division from MG Fillmore K. Mearns, commanding the unit until 1969. On assuming command Williamson issued a standing order that the division was to return 1000 rounds for every round fired at them. 1971 to 1973 From 1971 to 1973, Williamson served as the Chief of the U. S. Military Mission in Iran. He retired from the Army in 1973. Later life Williamson died on 28 January 2007 in Arlington, Virginia and was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

In 1870 the gallery in the nave was removed, and oak benches installed in place of the wooden pews. The floor was paved throughout and the aisles and chancel laid with Minton encaustic tiles. Choir stalls were built and a new altar table and altar rails provided. This restoration was funded by the rector, Rt. Revd. Bishop Edmund Hobhouse and executed by the contractor Mr. Thorley of Ellastone. The church reopened on 28 October 1870. On 25 July 1900, the cornerstone was laid for a major restoration by the architect E.

His brother-in-law, Jaivir singh is an alumnus of IIT Kanpur and is currently a physics teacher at the Allen career institute.  Legacy  Mists and clouds are aerosols Satheesh is reported to have done extensive studies on atmospheric aerosols and his work is known to have widened our understanding of their impact on climate. He elucidated how the radiation balance of the Earth-atmosphere system and climate are influenced by the aerosols and one of his principal contributions is the hypothesis he suggested for the resolution of anomalous absorption paradox, a meteorological problem where cloud absorption measurements, at times, show inconsistency with the theoretical calculations. He has also experimentally shown how human-generated soot results in higher atmospheric temperatures by absorbing sunlight. Dust Absorption Efficiency (DAE) is another area of focus of his researches and he has studied the topic in relation to Afro-Asian regions and Indian deserts. His studies have been documented in several peer-reviewed articles; ResearchGate an online repository of scientific articles, has listed 171 of them. Two of his articles, Enhanced aerosol loading over Arabian Sea during pre-monsoon season: Natural or Anthropogenic? and Short wave versus long wave radiative forcing due to aerosol over Indian Ocean: Role of sea-surface winds, were included in the AGU Highlights by the American Geophysical Union during 2002‚Äì03 and his article, Radiative Effects of Natural Aerosols: A Review was listed as a Top 25 Hottest Article by ScienceDirect, an online scientific database. Satheesh was a member of the first phase of Indian Ocean Experiment (INDOEX) conducted by an international team of scientists in 1999 and his article on the experiment warned of the rising aerosol levels in the atmosphere and its negative impact on climate. He also explained how monsoons were affected by the dust-containing aerosols of Arabian and Saharan regions and the sea-salt carrying aerosols of the Arabian sea. He has delivered several keynote or invited speeches on the topic. Satheesh has been involved with the several national and international scientific committees which included Scientific Committee of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme and Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences, Steering Committee on Aerosols, Clouds, Precipitation, Climate of the World Climate Research Program, Core Science Team for the Indian Satellite for Aerosols and Gases of Indian Space Research Organization and the Committee for the assessment of environmental impact of Namma Metro project, Bangalore. He was the principal investigator or co-prinicpal investigator of the Ganges Valley Aerosol Experiment (GVAX) and Multi-Angle Polarization Imager (MAPI) of ISRO and the Chief Mission Scientist of the Integrated Campaign for Aerosols, Gases and Radiation Budget (ICARB) experiment of ISRO. He sat in the technical programs committee of the Asian Aerosol Conference in 2005, program committee of the SPIE International symposium of 2006, departmental promotion committee and national committee on Aerosol Radiation Budget Studies (ARBS) of the Indian Space Research Organization and was a member of the working groups of ISRO - Geosphere Biosphere Programme (ISRO-GBP) (2001-2007), Environmental Monitoring Research Centre (EMRC) of India Meteorological Department and Hyperpsectral Signature Database Management System of the Department of Science and Technology. He was a co-convener of the National Space Science Symposium held at Kottayam in 2004 and the AOGS2014 conference organized by Asia Oceania Geosciences Society in Singapore in 2005. His contributions are also reported in the establishment of a South Asia regional office of Future Earth initiative at Divecha Centre for Climate Change in November 2016. Satheesh was one of the lead authors of the Chapter 7, Clouds and Aerosols, of the Fifth Assessment Report prepared by the Working Group I of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and is a member of the selection committee (2013‚Äì16) of the Haagen-Smit Prize of Elsevier. He has been associated with a number of science journals; he is a former associate editor of the Journal of Geophysical Research of American Geophysical Union, a former member of the editorial board of the Atmospheric Environment journal of Elsevier and the incumbent co-editor of Current Science journal of the Indian Academy of Sciences. He is a referee for a number of journals and is a reviewer for NASA, UNEP, Israel Science Foundation, ISRO, Department of Science and Technology (India) and Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, for their funding activities. He is also a former secretary (2003‚Äì06) of the Bangalore chapter of the Indian Meteorological Society.  Awards and honors  His early years in research earned Satheesh the Best Research Paper Award of the Physical Research Laboratory in 1997 and a Certificate of Merit of the Swadeshi Science Movement, Kochi in 1999. The International START Secretariat, USA awarded him the Young Scientist Award in 2001, the same year as he received the Young Associate-ship of the Indian Academy of Sciences, with the tenure running till 2005. The next year, he received the Young Scientists' Medal of the Indian National Science Academy and the Young Scientist Award of the World Meteorological Organisation. Three awards reached him in 2007, Asian Young Aerosol Scientist Award of the Asian Aerosol Research Assembly (AARA), Japan, SCOPUS Young Scientist Award in Earth Sciences of Elsevier and the PRL Research Award of the Physical Research Laboratory. He received the Rajib Goyal Prize in Physical Sciences of Kurukshetra University in 2008 and the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize, one of the highest Indian science awards in 2009. The same year, the American Geophysical Union selected him for the Editors‚Äô Citations for Excellence in Refereeing for his work in Geophysical Research Letters and The World Academy of Sciences awarded him the TWAS Prize, making him the first Malayali scientist to receive the honor. Satheesh, a NASA Senior fellow of NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and an ORAU Senior Fellow, received the Swarna Jayanthi Fellowship of the Department of Science and Technology for the year 2005‚Äì06. The Indian Academy of Sciences elected him as their fellow in 2010 and he became a fellow of the National Academy of Sciences, India, the same year.

A truck driven by an Arab citizen of Israel plowed into a group of uniformed Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers disembarking from a bus on the Armon Hanatziv Esplanade in East Jerusalem's East Talpiot neighborhood, close to the Trotner park and UNTSO headquarters, killing four and injuring 15. Just hours after the incident, Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister of Israel, blamed the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) for the attack, raising questions about how he came to that conclusion. Opponents criticized the Israeli Government for downplaying the political side. Later, the attack was claimed by an unknown Palestinian group called \\"The Martyr of Baha Alyan Collective\\", citing political motives. The attack was condemned by the United Nations, European Union, the United States and others.  Attack  thumb At around 13:00, a truck rammed into a group of IDF soldiers at a promenade in the East Talpiot neighborhood in southeast Jerusalem. One male and three female soldiers were killed and 15 soldiers were injured. Of those injured, two were in critical condition after the attack. The attacker was shot dead by several of the soldiers and their civilian tour guide. Israeli officials describe the attack to be an \\"act of terrorism\\". Initial reports, including an account by the civilian tour guide who used his personal handgun to shoot at the driver, alleged that one of the soldiers hesitated before shooting, possibly as a result of the manslaughter conviction earlier in the month of Sgt. Elor Azaria, who had killed an incapacitated Palestinian assailant. Despite this report, the IDF reported that at least two soldiers fired at the attacker, and denied a connection between troops' response to Azaria case. One of the cadets at the scene is quoted as saying that they fought for their friends and \\"Nobody was scared to shoot for even one minute\\". Victims The four fatalities were IDF soldiers studying in the Haim Laskov officers school: three cadets and an officer. * Lt. Yael Yekutiel, 20, from Givatayim * Second Lt.

Perpetrator A 28-year-old Arab Israeli man from Jabel Mukaber in East Jerusalem driving a car with an Israeli license plate. Nana 10 reported that he had served time in jail in the past, and Walla! reported he had Israeli citizenship. Prime Minister Netanyahu blamed ISIL soon after the attack stating \\"all signs show he is a supporter of the Islamic State\\". The claims made by him just hours after the attack raised questions to how he came to that conclusion. Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman also drew parallels with ISIL attacks in Germany and France. Opponents accused the Israeli government of downplaying politics, they claimed that Palestinian attacks are more motivated by nationalism rather than religion and considered Israeli accusations to be unconvincing for policymakers. Later reports stated that the perpetrator was a member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and that the PFLP had claimed him as their member. Others alleged that the perpetrator supported ISIL. A little-known Palestinian group called \\"The Martyr of Baha Alyan Collective\\" claimed responsibility on 9 January. It stated that it had no outside links, had acted on political motives and it wasn't its first attack. It also warned that it will carry out more attacks in the future. Aftermath Of nine suspects taken into custody on suspicion of involvement, five were members of the perpetrator's family: his wife, parents, and two siblings, and an Israeli Cabinet meeting was scheduled. At 20:00 local time Channel 2 reported that shots had been fired from the Jabel Mukaber at the Israeli Border Patrol. Channel 10 reported that Israel had started to put concrete obstacles around the village Jabel Mukaber. Accusations of reporting controversies NRG stated that the title used by the BBC, \\"Driver of lorry shot in Jerusalem after allegedly ramming pedestrians, injuring at least 15, Israeli media report\\", was biased.http://www.nrg.co.il/online/1/ART2/856/007.html?hp=1&cat;=875&loc;=5 Later that day Honest Reporting, an advocacy group focused on defending Israel in the media, wrote that the BBC modified the title and iterated over several other titles. Mako have criticized Fox News and CNN in addition to BBC for the titles that they used to describe the event. Mako claimed that omitting such information (withholding that it was a terrorist attack and done by a Palestinian) constitutes falsifying the reports. Mako also claimed that it is the same case as it was during Sharona market shooting, the murder of Hadar Cohen and the March 2016 attacks. Honest Reporting also criticized CNN, New York Times, The Guardian and NPR. Honest Reporting called the news headlines biased when they do not explain the key factors of terror attack or fail to mention that they were carried out by a Palestinian assailant, or for refusing to use the term \\"terrorist\\".

Prevention is generally done in babies born at a gestational age of less than 32 weeks. It is given by the endotracheal tube. Onset of effects is rapid. A number of doses may be needed. Side effects may include slow heart rate and low oxygen levels. Its use is also linked with intracranial bleeding. Pulmonary surfactant may be isolated from the lungs of cows or pigs or made artificially. Pulmonary surfactant was discovered in the 1950s and a manufactured version was approved for medical use in the United States in 1990. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. In the United Kingdom it costs the NHS 281.64 to 547.40 pounds per dose. Medical uses Pulmonary surfactant is used to treat and prevent respiratory distress syndrome in newborn babies. Prevention is generally done in babies born less than 32 weeks gestational age. Tentative evidence supports use in drowning. Types There are a number of types of pulmonary surfactants available. Like their natural counterparts, pulmonary surfactant preparations consist of phospholipids (mainly DPPC) combined with spreading agents such as SP-B and SP-C. Synthetic pulmonary surfactants: * Colfosceril palmitate (Exosurf) - a mixture of DPPC with hexadecanol and tyloxapol added as spreading agents * Pumactant (Artificial Lung Expanding Compound or ALEC) - a mixture of DPPC and PG * Lucinactant (KL-4) - composed of DPPC, palmitoyl-oleoyl phosphatidylglycerol, and palmitic acid, combined with a 21 amino acid synthetic peptide (sinapultide) that mimics the C-terminal helical domain of SP-B. * Venticute - DPPC, PG, palmitic acid and recombinant SP-C * Lucinactant (trade name Surfaxin) is a liquid medication that contains DPPC, POPG as the sodium salt, and palmitic acid. Animal derived surfactants: * Beractant ** (Alveofact) - extracted from cow lung lavage fluid, manufacturing by Boehringer Ingelheim ** (Survanta) - extracted from minced cow lung with additional DPPC, palmitic acid and tripalmitin, manufacturing by Abbvie ** (Beraksurf) - extracted from minced cow lung with additional DPPC, palmitic acid and tripalmitin, manufacturing by Tekzima * Calfactant (Infasurf) - extracted from calf lung lavage fluid * Poractant alfa (Curosurf) - extracted from material derived from minced pig lung History Researcher John Clements identified surfactants and their role in the 1950s. Mary Ellen Avery soon after showed that the lungs of premature infants couldn't produce surfactants.

The hills merge level into the eastern side of Exmoor and are included within the Exmoor National Park. Iron ore and other minerals have been extracted for industrial purposes, primarily by the Brendon Hills Iron Ore Company in the later half of the 19th century. Geology The Brendon Hills are largely formed from the Morte Slates, a thick faulted and folded sequence of Devonian age sedimentary rocks. An east-west aligned anticline/syncline pair known as the Brendon Anticline and Brendon Syncline folds these rocks. The fold couplet is itself offset by displacement of the rocks on the NNW-SSE aligned Timberscombe Fault System. Over the centuries they have been mined for minerals, notably ironstone from which iron is extracted for making steel. History Where lodes of iron ore reached the surface they were worked using bell pits from Roman times. 19th century In the mid-nineteenth century, the proprietors of the Ebbw Vale Iron Works acquired an interest in iron ore deposits in the Brendon Hills. Iron ore had been known there for centuries but not exploited industrially until the Brendon Hills Iron Ore Company was formed in 1853. Initially goethite/hematite was extracted and later unoxidised siderite. At an altitude of over and remote from usable roads, the deposits needed a form of transport to get the ore to South Wales. The West Somerset Mineral Railway, which included a long gravity worked incline on a gradient of 1 in 4, was built to take the ore to Watchet Harbour where it was loaded onto ships to be sent to Ebbw Vale for smelting. At Burrow Farm Mine a Cornish beam engine was installed around 1868 to pump water out of the mine. The mines provided employment for an average of 245 people between 1873 and 1882. Accommodation was also built for the mine workers. Though sometimes productive, no nineteenth century iron mine on the Brendons was profitable and the venture as a whole was financially ruinous. From 1852 to 1883 a little over three quarters of a million tons of usable ore was delivered to Ebbw Vale, each ton costing the company ¬£1.25 to produce and deliver for which it received 75p. Net losses amounted to ¬£762,000. Furthermore, the industry as a whole was prone to boom and bust, with a sharp decline from the early 1880s acting as the coup-de-grace. In 1907 another venture, the Somerset Mineral Syndicate, leased the railway and resumed mining. Several of the structures associated with the mines can still be seen. These include the Ironstone mine ventilation flue in Chargot Wood, and the remains of the Carnarvon New Pit. Individual mines Many mines have been recorded on the hills. The following operated at various times between 1837 and 1909. Baker's pit This mine is sometimes referred to as \\"Baker's mine\\" or simply \\"Bakers\\". Primarily aimed at Manganese, this pit was served by a siding off the West Somerset Mineral Railway (WSMR). It was an early pit latterly developed and briefly productive in iron ore in the years 1881‚Äì2, but it closed in May 1883. Scant evidence remains that the pit ever existed. Bearland Wood mine Bearland Wood ventilation flue The first adit was started at this iron mine in 1854, aiming to work towards Gupworthy. Little ore was found and working had ceased by 1864. Later that year the Mines Captain, Morgan Morgans, decided to drive a new adit, which proved very successful, yielding 12000 tons of brown Haematite which was taken to Langham Hill pit by an incline operated by horse powered whims. The ore was loaded on to WSMR wagons at Langham Hill. This incline was abandoned in 1866‚Äì7 when Bearland Wood mine was joined underground with Langham Hill pit. Mines on the tops of hills are usually sunk from above, with adits for drainage or access driven laterally to the hillside from the ore, coal or other target mineral. Bearland Wood mine was worked the other way round, with vertical working following lateral boring. Bearland Wood faced the universal mining problem of ventilation in a way which was both very old and radically new. Most industrial age mines were drained and ventilated using pumps, typically powered by steam engines. Morgans equipped Bearland Wood with a ventilation flue where a chimney stack was built above the mine's upward shaft and a coal- fired furnace was placed at the foot of the chimney. The furnace sucked air from the mine shaft which sucked fresh air from the lateral adit in turn. The air flow was guided by wooden ducts so that it always passed through areas where men worked. Miners extended or redirected the ducts as the working faces moved. This method long predated steam pumps, but as Morgans was erecting it at Bearland Wood the Mines Inspector at Risca Colliery (near where Morgans had been a colliery manager) declared steam pumps to be unsatisfactory and ordered their older ventilation furnaces to be reinstated. The ventilation flue at Bearland Wood is a scheduled Ancient Monument. Its conservation was supported by the Heritage Lottery Fund. Betsy mine This iron mine was served by a siding off the WSMR, it is sometimes referred to as \\"New Langham Mine\\". It was the last new mine in the area when it opened around 1875. It closed in 1883. Almost no trace remains of the mine's existence. Blackland mine This iron mine was operated independently of the Ebbw Vale Company near Withypool, west of the Brendon Hills. It operated from about 1875 to 1881 then briefly in 1895, leaving a large bank of ore stockpiled on site. In 1907 a Withypool mining company started transporting ore by traction engine to Minehead to be shipped north, but this ended in October. The Somerset Mineral Syndicate added this to their portfolio of Colton and Timwood and built a rope worked incline powered by a stationary engine to lower ore to the road. The workings were prospected but the ore sent to Minehead was almost all from the stockpile. Burrow Farm mine Burrow Farm Engine House This iron mine was served by a siding off the WSMR. It closed around 1868. The shell of its engine house, which was moved lock, stock and barrel from Langham Hill mine, stands today, the ore field's only engine house to do so. Carew mine Sinking the shaft of this iron mine may have started in 1865. The last ore appears to have been raised in 1871. A photograph shows that ore from Carew was handled separately by the WSMR so that charges and income could be allocated accordingly. When the mine was surveyed in 1883 the shaft was flooded. Carew's ore was a target for the 1907 venture at Timwood Tunnel, but that venture failed before any ore was reached. All that can be seen in modern times is a small disturbance on the surface near a car park. Carnarvon new pit This iron mine was served by a siding off the WSMR, on the opposite side of the line from Carnarvon Old Pit. It opened in 1866 and initially yielded good ore in quantity, but it closed in 1882. The ruins of the buildings have now been scheduled as an ancient monument. Carnarvon and Raleigh's Cross mines were both very wet. Complex interlocking drainage and flood prevention features were installed. Carnarvon old pit This iron mine was next to the WSMR, on the opposite side from Carnarvon New Pit. It is sometimes referred to as \\"Old Carnarvon Pit\\". It closed in the early 1860s. Colton mine This iron mine is sometimes referred to as \\"Coltonpits\\" and occasionally as \\"Colton Pits\\". There is evidence of ancient mining at Colton, with the main site visible on maps just over 3 km ENE of . The site was investigated in 1847, but throughout the period up to 1875 when the WSMR was flourishing Colton mine was described as \\"insignificant\\", though in the early 1880s, just as the whole Brendon venture was on the point of collapse, output was increasing and an extra siding on the WSMR was sought but not started. When the Somerset Mineral Syndicate Ltd attempted to resurrect mining and the WSMR from 1907 to 1910 it reopened Colton mine, but entered it through what had been a drainage adit in Galloping Bottom, some distance north west and downhill of the original workings. This location meant that whilst underground costs might have been reduced, it was difficult to get the ore to the WSMR. The original idea was to build an aerial ropeway, but a wholly new gauge tramway was built instead. This incorporated a incline to get the ore up to the top of the hill, followed by a two-mile run (including a timber viaduct) to where the ore was tipped into standard gauge wagons which were lowered down the larger incline then hauled to Watchet harbour. The aim of developing Colton mine was to give an income until the Syndicate's main hope - Timwood - started to produce, but output was disappointing (a mere 4800 tons of ore was raised in 1908-10) and what ore was produced caked furnaces and proved almost unsaleable. In desperation the Syndicate erected plant at Washford to turn the poor ore into briquettes, thereby reducing volume, mass and impurities, but the undercapitalised venture failed in 1909 and all mining ceased, including Colton. The Syndicate voted to be wound up on 24 March 1910 and its assets were auctioned off on 28 June that year. in modern times only the faintest traces of the workings, incline and narrow gauge railway can be detected. Eisen Hill mine Eisen Hill is named \\"Ison Hill\\" on OS maps and sometimes \\"Eyson Hill\\" elsewhere. This iron mine opened in 1854 and stuttered to an end by 1877, with patchy result between. The mine was in soft ground which warranted different mining techniques. The company had a powder magazine and three cottages near the mine, one of which was used as the mine offices. The WSMR took the first steps towards seeking powers to extend their line from (where at least some Eisen Hill output was transferred to their rails) to Joyce's Cleeve to tap their product, but its poor prospects and their financial straits led them to back off. No buildings survive. Elworthy Mine This iron mine is sometimes referred to as \\"Yeanon\\" or \\"Yennan\\". A trial shaft was sunk in 1875 and, whilst seven levels were developed, little ore was found. In Jones' words it \\"never amounted to much.\\" It had closed by 1883. A Liverpool syndicate investigated the mine in 1907, employing around a dozen men, but nothing came of it. Only a small mound remains to suggest any workings ever took place. Gupworthy new pit Digging started on this iron mine in 1871. In 1879 it closed with its neighbours, but was one of the few which reopened later that year, reaching its maximum depth of in November 1882, only to close with the rest of the orefield in June 1883. The WSMR built a branch to serve the pit, with a siding to bring coal to the engine house. By 2011 no visible trace of the pit remained. Gupworthy old pit In 1863‚Äì4, the WSMR built is western extension through this iron mine's pit yard, which rivalled that at Raleigh Cross in size. It had been taken over and revived in 1852 and was said in the mid-1850s to have \\"good ore in workable quantities\\" which significantly exceeded pre-railway haulage capacity, leading to stockpiles. In the area's mid-1870s \\"peak years\\" the principal contributors were Raleigh's Cross mine and Gupworthy old pit. It closed with its neighbours in 1879, being one of the few which re-opened later that year. The mine reached its maximum depth of in October 1881, closing with its neighbours in June 1883. On closure machinery was brought to the surface and the mine allowed to flood. Some plant was returned to South Wales, most eventually went for scrap. Closing the mine gave the WSMR an additional problem, as the only water crane south of the incline was fed from Gupworthy Old pit. The crane and header tank were moved to Brendon Hill. Gupworthy old pit had a permanent engine house, where a boy was killed in an explosion in November 1881. The miners' cottages were referred to as \\"The Square\\". When the WSMR's remaining assets were auctioned in 1924 the trackbed through the pit was sold to local landowners. Some remains were identifiable in 1964, but in 2011 \\"not a wrack remains save for a datestone of 1864, rescued from the engine house.\\" Higher Goosemoor mine This mine is sometimes referred to, perhaps ironically, as \\"California\\". With others it closed in 1879, but reopened later in the year, eventually reaching a depth of with four levels and two shallow secondary drifts, known as Richard's Pit. This site survived in production until all mining ceased across the Brendons in 1883. Portable pumping machinery was used and ore was carted to the railhead at . Kennesome Hill mine This mine is sometimes referred to as Kennisham Hill. A Roman coin was found in old workings at Kennesome Hill, suggesting great age. In Victorian times it had been worked on a small scale before 1867. In 1871 \\"Curtis's Drift\\" was started, reaching by September 1874. Considerable development took place at Kennesome Hill, including an aerial ropeway (referred to locally as the \\"Flying Machine\\") to convey output to a siding next to Langham Hill pit, where it was tipped into WSMR wagons. This arrangement lasted until 1876, after which ore was taken from the mine to Gupworthy by a horse-drawn tramway. The mine closed with its neighbours in 1879, but re-opened later the same year, going on with the Gupworthy pits to become the most productive of the orefield's final years; it closed for good in September 1883. In November 1877 the company was fined for not providing a proper platform for workers at the mine. The mine had a permanent rotary steam engine for both pumping and winding. Unlike most other such buildings in the area its engine house was not demolished for its stone and still stood into the 1970s. Its state, however, was \\"parlous\\", so the Forestry Commission blew it up on 7 March 1978, leaving only the pumping engine's granite base as a memorial, albeit at some distance from the site of the mine. By 2011 this block was all which remained to show the mine had ever existed. Langham Hill pit The ruins of the Langham Hill Engine House This iron mine was served by a siding off the WSMR. Work started on the mine in 1866 and it closed in 1883. The adit was horizontal into the hillside. In 1877 the company was fined for failing to provide proper ventilation, proper fencing and proper drying facilities for miners' clothes. As well as ore lifted from the mine itself the site served for periods as railheads for ore from Kennesome Hill and Bearland Wood mines. Neither route was straightforward. Ore travelled from Kennesome Hill via an aerial ropeway, thereby crossing a sharp, deep valley and ore travelled up from Bearland Wood via an incline operated by horse powered whims. The mine had a substantial stone and slate engine house with a rotary beam pumping and winding engine. In 1878‚Äì9 the machinery and its engine house were dismantled, moved to Burrow Farm mine and re-erected, leaving bare foundations at Langham Hill. When the mines closed the Ebbw Vale Company not only had to bear considerable losses but it also became liable for duties and charges it had entered into in the heady early days when the Brendon Hills seemed like Klondyke. James Insole, owner of the Chargot Estate, entered litigation with the company for costs associated with the cessation of mining. This eventually went to arbitration, where the main beneficiaries were lawyers and the main loser was the Ebbw Vale Company. In the midst of this the Ebbw Vale company covered the Langham Hill engine house foundations with the pit tip, landscaping the site to appease Insole. Remarkably, this had a beneficial outcome, as it \\"preserved\\" the foundations so that when the Exmoor National Park Authority excavated them in 1995‚Äì8 they were found to be in good order. They can be visited to this day. Raleigh's Cross mine Before its expansion in the 1850s the mine was referred to as the \\"Tone mine\\". This iron mine was served by a branch off the WSMR, which was relayed early in 1876. It was one of the mines which Ebenezer Rogers examined when he started the major development of the Brendon Hills orefield in the 1850s, crystallised by the formation of the Brendon Hills Iron Ore Company in 1853. The workings at Raleigh's Cross were progressively deepened, reaching a vertical depth of in 1858. Mining in the area before this time had been sufficiently small scale for horse-drawn cartage of ore to be sufficient, but \\"the mines at Gupworthy and Raleigh's Cross .. proved the existence of good ore in workable quantities\\" making industrial-scale transport necessary, this in turn led to the formation the WSMR company (Royal Assent was granted on 16 July 1855) and construction of the railway itself, which was in full operation to Raleigh's Cross by March 1861. The mine was substantial both above and below ground. In 1857 an extensive and expensive adit was driven from the lower workings to emerge from the hillside below Sea View House. This involved extensive trialling of a tunnel boring machine which proved \\"greatly underpowered and in danger of knocking itself to pieces\\". This adit drained the mine to a depth of , but considerable machinery was needed to drain the mine's eventual depth of (achieved in 1879, the year the orefield first closed) and to wind ore to the surface. Raleigh's cross mine was the only one in the orefield to require an engine for each role. The engine which wound ore to the surface was mounted in the first floor of the substantial pithead buildings, it pulled the mine's narrow gauge tramway wagons along the sloping drift out of the ground and onto a platform above a standard gauge siding so the ore could be tipped directly into wagons beneath. The same building also housed a heated room for miners to dry their clothes and a Miners' Literature Institute. Raleigh's Cross and the two Carnarvon mines formed the nucleus of the mining community of Brendon Hill. In the years up to 1867 Raleigh's Cross and Carnarvon New had produced over 100,000 tons of ore, peaking at an output of 400 tons per week. At Raleigh's Cross in 1856 two men, both until recently agricultural labourers, attempted to tamp a black powder explosive charge with an iron instead of wooden rod. A spark ensued, detonating the charge; one of the men died and the other was badly injured. The coroner's verdict was \\"accidental death\\". Raleigh's Cross and its neighbours were wet mines, necessitating extensive works, plant, interconnections and flood countermeasures. The mine closed abruptly along with its neighbours in 1879, but reopened later the same year. It finally succumbed in 1882, followed by complete closure of the orefield in 1883. The branch to the site was lifted in 1884 and the engines dismantled and sent to Ebbw Vale for reuse. The mine buildings were blown up by the Syndicate to provide ballast to gravity work the incline and, in 1909, hardcore infill for the timber jetty at Watchet. Only faint traces of the mine remain, visible only to the knowing eye. Smallcombe Bottom mine This iron mine was also known as \\"Smoky Bottom mine\\". It had closed by 1867. All traces have been removed or landscaped. Timwood tunnel The workings at Timwood are sometimes referred to as \\"Timwood adit\\" or simply \\"Timwood\\". Timwood tunnel was the last venture in the orefield. It was the brainchild of the Somerset Mineral Syndicate Ltd which was formed on 11 March 1907 to work mines and lease the WSMR to carry output to Watchet harbour. The syndicate took over Blackland and Colton mines, as described above, and started new workings at Timwood. The Syndicate expected Timwood to be its prize asset. It was the only mine at the foot of the Brendons, aiming to do on a grand scale what some mines had done on a smaller scale at the top, i.e. drill horizontally into the hillside (or even better, drill at a gentle upward slope to drain water and assist tramming ore and waste) until it encountered veins of ore previously worked from above at Carew and Raleigh's Cross mines. This approach had been suggested but not tried in 1854. It sought to reduce the cost and effort involved in pumping water and raising ore to the surface only to lower it down again using the incline to Comberow. It came at the price of having to drill much further to reach ore and carried an increased risk of not reaching ore at all. As at Colton the workings at Timwood used gauge hopper wagons underground, but the mine entrance was so close to the WSMR and so close to its level that wagons could be hand worked to a movable crossing over the WSMR line then tipped direct into wagons bound for the harbour, thereby avoiding multiple handling. Apart from small amounts discovered while pursuing their main target, this method of working remained an aspiration, because the Syndicate ran out of money in 1909, it had many costs and almost no income. It voted to be wound up on 24 March 1910 and its assets were auctioned off on 28 June that year, with Timwood's tunnel long \\"but still well short of ore- bearing ground\\". Unlike mine buildings at the hill top, those at Timwood were small and appeared temporary, none being built of stone or brick. The Robey steam engine from the incline winding house was installed to drive the compressor which powered the drills used to create holes for explosive charges. A second small building served as a smithy and the third was a mess and a dry for miners' clothes. The mine has left no visible evidence above ground. Withiel Hill mine This iron mine, also known as \\"Floriel Hill Mine\\" and \\"Florey Hill mine\\", was sunk in 1866, but little development work was undertaken. It continued to give regular, three-figure quarterly tonnages until it closed in April 1876.

Fire fighters in South Korea are Fire officers, members of an obligatory fire-fighting unit, and Volunteer fire fighters. Regarding fire fighting activities, the Framework Act on Fire Service, rescue and emergency activities are regulated by Act of 119 Rescue and Emergency Medical Services. The national fire department is the responsibility of the Ministry of Public Safety and Security, and the local fire department is in charge of the city and circuit fire headquarters. There are multiple criticisms such as the problem of the command system, the status of the firefighting organization, and the poor treatment of the firefighters, although a plurality of organizations are set up to carry out firefighting activities.  History   Before the Goryeo Dynasty  According to Samguk Sagi, it is recorded that the fire occurred in King Munmu 2 years, 6 years, 8 years, and guess that the concept of arson was born. From the Goryeo Dynasty, a system on the level of fire at the national level began to be prepared, preventing the fire with the name 'ban blame system', but no specialized organization existed. However, party officials and responsible officials in each government office are responsible for preventing fire, management has been dismissed unless fire prevents, civilians fire out deliberately or deliberately fire Put disciplinary discrimination by fireplace and place punishment, place administrators of gold coins in warehouse after 20 years of Wun Buddhist fire, and when the history checked occasionally and neglected their duties, punished.  Joseon Dynasty  Training of the court fire brigade of the 1900s The fire fighting system of the Joseon Dynasty was established in 1426 (Sejong 8th year), the first firefighting organization specialized in the Korean Peninsula was set up under the salary, and began taking charge of the fire protection work. Initially, the forbidden army suppressed the fire, renamed the fire battalion as Ghum-Hwa(Í∏àÌôî,Á¶ÅÁÅ´. fire fighter) in the dynasty era and working for 24 hours.  Korea under Japanese rule  Fire department in the Japanese emperor's fortune occupation is responsible for the Department of Protection or Security Department of the Governor-General of Korea. In the 1910s, firefighters were placed at the police office in Seoul City and other major cities We organized firefighting groups and arranged firefighters. In 1922, the Gyeongseong firefighting group was rebuilt by the Gyeongseong fire house, and in 1925, the first fire station of the Gyeongseong fire station rewrote.  United States Army Military Government in Korea and Republic of Korea  = National Fire Service = In 1950 the National Fire Department of the Security Bureau was established, but in the same year it was reduced to being a directorate of the security department, and in 1955 the safety and protection department in charge of the fire department was in charge of the security department together with the guard department guard. The fire department was installed again in 1961 and was in charge of fire fighting work in the fire department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Security Department of the Internal Affairs Department until 1971. In 1975 the civil defense fund law came into force and the Ministry became responsible for civil defense affairs, in which the NFD was partly responsible. Since then, the National Emergency Management Agency was established in 2004 after the fire accident of the Daegu subway and the typhoon, but was dismantled by the Sinking of MV Sewol in 2014 and was transferred to the Ministry of Public Safety and Security. In 2017, on the basis of the Central Fire Service, the National Fire Agency was established as the country's singular firefighting service. = Local Fire Service = In 1945, the fire department was established in the local government police department during the US military rule. In 1946, the Fire Fire Defense Committee and the municipal fire department were established, the Fire Department was established in 1947 and it was autonomous under the Ministry of Commerce, but in 1948 belonged to the state police administration regime. The fire department was established in Seoul Metropolitan City and Busan Metropolitan City in 1972, and in 1975, it was responsible for firefighting affairs in the fire department of the Civil affairs administration of each circuit. Since 1976 the mayor and county guard were in charge of firefighting work only in areas where fire stations were not established, but in 1992 the circuit Fire headquarters was established and reached the present.  Fire service structure  Gyeonggi Disaster and Safety Headquarters The firefighting organization of the Republic of Korea consists of the National Fire Agency under the Ministry of Public Safety and Security and the city or circuit firefighting headquarters. Under the NFA's administrative supervision there are National 119 Rescue Headquarters and a National Fire Service Academy, and under the city or circuit Firefight Headquarters there are fire stations and local fire academies. The NFA is responsible to the central government, while the city or county fire headquarters is managed by the local government respectively.

However, a budget of about 7 billion won is consumed for establishing one fire station, and in municipalities with poor financial autonomy passively responding to the establishment of a fire station.  Fire officers  In 2008 Namdaemun fire, Firefighters extinguishing the fire. The firefighters of the Republic of Korea are divided into 119 Fire Fighting Corps, 119 Rescue Squad, 119 Ambulance Corps by their work.  Rank  It can be divided into 11 classes of national workers and 10 classes of regional workers.  Problem of disease  South Korean firefighters work for about 84 hours a week, and there is little support for treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder. Indeed, the fire fighter with occupational illness is 14.3%. However, 88 percent of the firemen who wounded injured due to disadvantage did not declare that they were official illness. Diseases such as leukemia and blood cancer are not acknowledged to be official affairs in the state, and such a tone is maintained even after the Supreme Court's ruling.  Manpower shortage problem  In order to solve the problem of excessive working hours, the local fire department changed the shift from two shifts to three shifts, but the total number of firefighters worked on the job wasn't added. In addition, the number of firefighters needed to be dispatched at the end of 2014 amounted to 50493, but only about 41 percent of the respondents are able to fill the vacancy.

It has acquired a monopoly of all repair trades. \\"Breakages\\" is the focus of a critique of capitalism, shown as exerting undue political influence while hampering beneficial technological progress to protect its own interests. Shaw's Preface Set in the then- future year of 1962, Shaw wrote The Apple Cart in a period of Conservative government in Britain, before the Welfare State reforms that followed World War II.Bernard F. Dukore, \\"Playing Kings, Ultimatums, and Abdications: The Apple Cart and To Play The King\\", The Comparatist, Volume 40, October 2016 pp. 267-283, doi=10.1353/com.2016.0015 In his Preface to the play, Shaw referred to \\"Breakages, Limited\\" in the context of \\"the mischief done by our system of private Capitalism in setting up huge vested interests in destruction, waste, and disease.\\" He wrote that the name of Breakages came to him as a result of a visit many years earlier to the inventor and playwright Alfred Warwick Gattie, who demonstrated to him a device that would enable smooth transfer of crates of glass lightbulbs in transit, minimising breakage. The development of this device, Gattie had told him, was opposed by the vested interests of \\"The glass blowers whose employment was threatened ... the industry of repairing our railway trucks ... and the railway porters ... He fought them undauntedly; but they were too strong for him\\" and the invention was never adopted.Text of The Apple Cart, Project Gutenberg Australia. Shaw depicted Breakages as representing \\"plutocracy\\", which subordinates democratic government to its power, to the extent that even socialist politicians \\"no longer dare even to talk of nationalizing any industry\\" which can return profit for the \\"plutocrats\\", or attract subsidies for them. \\"Not until Breakages is itself broken will it cease to have a message for us.\\" Portrayal in The Apple Cart In the play, Breakages is \\"the biggest industrial corporation in the country [Britain]\\". In Act I Lysistrata, the \\"Powermistress General\\" in charge of energy supply, describes how Breakages buys up and suppresses any new invention that threatens its interests, causing energy to cost \\"twice as much as it should\\". She shows how the company influences the working of government: \\"if I attempt to fight them I shall be hounded out of public life\\". In Act II King Magnus threatens to abdicate in favour of his son Robert, in whose opinion \\"the country ... is really governed by Breakages, Limited\\", and to enter politics himself and oppose Breakages. Shaw is suggesting that a powerful individual could resist Breakages more effectively than democratic politics can. Critical comment Influence on politics A \\"devastating satire\\", The Apple Cart depicts the de facto political power of \\"Breakages\\" without offering a credible prospect that this could be overcome. The account in the Preface of the fate of Gattie's invention fails to convincingly \\"demonstrate the power of corrupt plutocracy over industry and politics\\", as the culprits in that case appear to have been rather \\"organized labour and unimaginative officialdom\\". The theme of the \\"businessman's hand\\" behind government, embodied here as \\"Breakages\\", appears also in the character of the armaments maker Mr Undershaft in his Major Barbara, and in that of the businessman Alfred Mangan in Heartbreak House. Hindrance of technological progress Brian Winston has described \\"Breakages, Limited\\" as a \\"poetic version\\" of factors, other than cultural conservatism, that tend to impede technological progress. This has been termed \\"the 'law' of the suppression of radical potential\\". In other works Mary Lou and Archie in Robert A. Heinlein's short story Let There Be Light debate the validity of the picture symbolised by \\"Breakages Ltd.\\" of planned obsolescence and corporate resistance to innovation. The name is again used to represent obsolescence in an account of marketing of computer software, where it is sometimes implied that \\"the computer user, as well as the software, will be obsolete if s/he does not buy the latest product\\".
