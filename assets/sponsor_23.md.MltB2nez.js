The tour hit the English-speaking world in Australia with the second live recorded special from Perth. She landed in America, determined to play smaller markets like Syracuse and Poughkeepsie before sweeping across America. The summer dates were across Europe beginning in a continued 6 sold out Wembley/London across the continent as the 3rd single, \\"One Shining Moment\\" was hitting the Top 10. The Palais de Sportes in Paris was a highlight for two nights. The album continued to do well for the holidays when her huge Japanese hit \\"If We Hold on Together\\" became a European smash supported by the airing of \\"Christmas in Vienna\\" with Placido Domingo and Jose Carreras. Television exposure had been key throughout this tour. Earlier in the spring, Diana was invited to close the entire \\"Royal Command Performance for the Queen\\". It was there her first single from the album was destined for #1! The Royal Command Performance once again was instrumental in making the song a hit. She returned to America to do second round dates in major markets like New York. The tour had successfully conquered North America (Canada dates were after the first run of New York dates), Asia, the English-speaking world and Europe for over 100 dates.

The German sponsoring organisation was founded in Tabarz on 17 August 2002. The hospital offers healthcare for the indigenous Quechua people in Southern Peru. The basis for the interdenominational, evangelistic work of the hospital is the World Evangelical Alliance.Diospi Suyana: Glaubensbekenntnis (auf der Website des Spitals).  The Concept  The hospital is located in the Andes of south Peru, in the Curahuasi District, at an altitude of 2,650m. Owing to its proximity to Cusco, Abancay and Lima, the hospital is relatively accessible. Within a 3-hour drive of the hospital live around 750,000 people, the vast majority of whom are Quechua-speaking. The clinic offers comprehensive medical care to the local people, providing support predominantly to the Quechua people, many of whom are unable to speak Spanish. The hospital includes 55 beds, 4 operating theatres, an intensive care unit, Laboratory and X-ray department. The staff includes approximately 110 Peruvian and 40 foreign workers. The building of the hospital began on 24 May 2005. In attendance at the official opening of the hospital on 31 August 2007 were over 4,500 people, including the Peruvian First Lady at the time, Pilar Nores de Garcia, and the Peruvian health minister, Dr. Carlos Vallejos.http://www.diospi-suyana.de/the- concept/?lang=en Since then the Dental and Eye clinics have been added to the hospital. In April 2012 the Diospi-Suyana-Children's clubhouse was built and hosts the children's clubs weekly. The Diopsi-Suyana-School was set up in March 2014. The school and pre-school offers the opportunity of education to 650 children.http://www.diospi-suyana.de/das-colegio-diospi-suyana/?lang=en The German sponsoring organisation was founded in Tabarz on 17 August 2002 by 10 people.Klaus-Dieter John: ‚ÄûIch habe Gott gesehen.\\" Diospi Suyana - Hospital der Hoffnung. 4. Auflage. Brunnen, Gie√üen/Basel 2011, , S 76. The building work began on 24 May 2005. And the official opening of the Hospital took place on 31 August 2007 with over 4,500 people attending.  Funding  An estimated 50,000 individuals and 180 companies have supported the different Diospi Suyana projects up until August 2005 with donations from totalling around 20.5 million USD. With these donations the hospital team, dental clinic, eye clinic, children's clubhouse and school have all been funded. This money has also been used to support the treatment of around 125,000 patients. Diospi Suyana is one of the largest employers in the Apur√≠mac Region; with currently around 140 Peruvians employed in the hospital and school. The long-term work of the hospital is covered by an international support network, consisting in May 2014 of exactly 945 people. A further source of income for the hospital is through the Diospi-Suyana foundation. The patients contribute around 30% of the hospital's monthly budget through treatment costs. The Peruvian authorities contribute by a reimbursement of VAT and reduced price electricity provision.http://www.diospi-suyana.de/die-finanzierung-3/?lang=en Diospi Susana is registered as a charitable organisation in Peru, Germany and the USA. The German newspaper \\"Die Welt\\" published in 2008 a piece holding Diospi Suyana up as an example of excellence in relation to the use of charitable spending.Margita Feldrapp: ‚ÄûIch gebe alles, was ich kann.\\" Wie ein deutscher Arzt Spenden f√ºr sein Krankenhaus in Peru sammelt. Die Welt, 19. Februar 2008.  Aims  The aims of Diospi Suyana include: improving the medical care of the local people (Campesinos) through community and inpatient care, training of local nurses, medical campaigns to the surrounding towns, collaborative work with the government-provisioned local healthcare teams, education of patients on healthy living and prevention of common medical conditions, and, through donations, reduced-cost treatment for patients. The promotion of education for children in the District of Curahuasi is being achieved through the building and long term maintenance of a Christian school of international standard, the imparting of Christian values through Bible-based teaching, the use of modern teaching techniques, and is ultimately providing the children with better future prospects. Scholarships are available for children with lesser means through individual sponsorship; the children are all treated equally regardless of race or class. The Gospel of Jesus Christ is furthered in conjunction with the local church through the hospital chaplain, Christian literature, films, the life and testimony of the missionaries, children's work, women's- and men's- work, social projects, the involvement of the missionaries in the local churches. As a member of the World Evangelical Alliance, the hospital rejects scientific consensus like the Theory of Evolution and seeks to openly raise doubts to their credibility.Klaus John: Wie √ºberwinden wir ein Dogma? Mit Mut und Einsicht. Diospi Suyana, 15. Januar 2017 (auf der Website des Spitals). The local Quechua - Peruvian culture is respected and appreciated: the hospital and school are named in Quechua, a Quechua course is taught in the Colegio Diospi Suyana (the Diospi School), the patients, and the children in the school, are treated with respect, the school and hospital provide training opportunities for local employees. A collaborative partnership exists between Diospi Suyana and Christians and churches in Europe and worldwide. Awareness across the industrialised nations of the issues the South American people are facing is being raised through regular sharing of information (magazine articles, letters, films) about the hospital and school in churches; visiting groups who input into particular hospital or school projects for a short period, as well as information and the holding of presentations.

Carstensen is the Fairleigh S. Dickinson Jr. Professor in Public Policy and professor of psychology at Stanford University, where she is founding director of the Stanford Center on Longevity and the principal investigator for the Stanford Life-span Development Laboratory. Carstensen is best known in academia for socioemotional selectivity theory, which has illuminated developmental changes in social preferences, emotional experience and cognitive processing from early adulthood to advanced old age. By examining postulates of socioemotional selectivity theory, Carstensen and her colleagues (most notably Mara Mather) identified and developed the conceptual basis of the positivity effect. Biography Carstensen was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and spent most of her childhood in Rochester, New York. She graduated from the University of Rochester in 1978 and earned her Ph.D. in psychology from West Virginia University in 1983. She served as assistant professor of psychology at Indiana University from 1983-1987, and then joined Stanford University's department of psychology in 1987. In addition to her role as professor of psychology, she served as the Barbara D. Finberg director of the Clayman Institute for Gender Research from 1997-2001 and chair of the psychology department from 2004-2006. With Thomas Rando, Carstensen founded the Stanford Center on Longevity in 2007, where she currently serves as its director. Carstensen is considered a thought leader on longevity. Her essays and opinion pieces have appeared in the New York Times, Time Magazine, and The Boston Globe. Her TED talk has been viewed more than a million times. In 2011 she published A Long Bright Future: Happiness, Health and Financial Security in an Era of Increased Longevity.

SST is a life-span theory of motivation which posits that people prioritize emotionally meaningful goals when time horizons are constrained. According to SST, people with expansive time horizons are more likely to prioritize exploration and expanding horizons, seeking out new relationships that promise long-term benefits. In contrast, as time horizons grow limited people prioritize emotionally meaningful goals that are more likely to result in feelings of emotional satisfaction. Consequently, people with limited time horizons tend to have smaller, more carefully selected social networks and experience better emotional well-being. Positivity effect Carstensen is responsible for identifying and developing the conceptual basis for the positivity effect, an age-related trend in cognitive processing that favors positive over negative information in attention and memory. A meta-analysis of 100 empirical studies of the positivity effect found that this effect is larger in studies that include wider age comparisons and do not constrain cognitive processing. Future time perspective scale The future time perspective (FTP) scale was developed by Carstensen and Frieder Lang. The FTP scale includes ten items answered by indicating agreement on a 7-point Likert- type scale (from 1= very untrue, to 7 = very true). The last three items of the future time perspective scale (#s 8-10) are reverse coded. When scoring the measure, researchers calculate the participant‚Äôs mean score. Prior research shows a linear relationship between chronological age and time horizons. The strength of the relationship varies as a function of the age range in the sample: nearly always, the relationship is positive, with high scores indicative of long time horizons.

The image of the Buddha is officially known as Maha Thetkya Mayazein (; ). Construction began in 1853 under the patronage of King Mindon Min, but the site was not completed until 1878 because of internal discord in the mid-1860s, including a palace rebellion. The temple was initially modelled after the Ananda Temple in Bagan, but the completed temple does not resemble the former. The Kyauktawgyi Buddha is a huge sculpted image of the Buddha seated in the Bh≈´mipassa MudrƒÅ (). The figure was sculpted from a single block of pale green marble quarried at Sagyin, north of Mandalay. The stone block was transported over the course of 13 days, requiring the manpower of 10,000 to 12,000 men, to the temple site, where it was carved. The image was consecrated in 1865.

The work was jointly commissioned by the National Symphony Orchestra, the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra, and the National Arts Centre Orchestra. It was premiered in Boston November 21, 2013, with the Boston Symphony Orchestra and principal bassoonist Richard Svoboda performing under conductor Rafael Fr√ºhbeck de Burgos. Composition The piece has a duration of roughly 20 minutes and is composed in three numbered movements. Instrumentation The concerto is scored solo bassoon and orchestra, comprising two flutes, two oboes, Cor anglais, two clarinets, bass clarinet, two bassoons, four French horns, trombone, tuba, three percussionists, celesta, harp, and strings. Reception Jeremy Eichler of The Boston Globe welcomed a new bassoon concerto to the repertory, but also wrote, \\"Throughout the work, Neikrug‚Äôs orchestral writing gives a wide berth to the solo line, so wide in fact that the piece on Thursday felt on occasion a bit spare. Meanwhile, its derivation of thematic material from the bassoon‚Äôs own instrumental bag of tricks has an organic appeal, but also left the ear wishing at times for a bolder and more personalized specificity of sound world.\\" Anne Midgette of The Washington Post similarly called the work \\"a collection of wandering phrases, starting with a movement that features juxtapositions of ascending bassoon lines and descending orchestral lines (and vice versa), and that moves on to the requisite slow movement, followed by the requisite rapid one, without ever quite taking hold of the qualities of timbre and incision for which it seems to be groping.\\" Elaine Schmidt of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel was more favorable, writing, \\"Constructed like a conversation between bassoon and orchestra, the piece is supports the bassoon's solo passages with light, sometimes transparent orchestral sounds, contrasted with denser, bigger orchestral passages while the bassoon is not playing.\\" Natasha Gauthier of the Ottawa Citizen also gave the work praise, saying of Neikrug, \\"His taut, disciplined writing ‚Äî the concerto clocks in at a mean, lean 20 minutes ‚Äî exploits the bassoon‚Äôs conversational quality, as well as its unusually expressive range. Neikrug mitigates the bassoon‚Äôs tendency to blend in, not cut through, with constantly judicious use of orchestral texture and colour.\\" References Compositions by Marc Neikrug 2013 compositions Neikrug 21st-century classical music Music commissioned by the National Symphony Orchestra Music commissioned by the Boston Symphony Orchestra Music commissioned by the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra ","title":"Bassoon Concerto (Neikrug)"},{"id":"47199941","text":"\\"Just Waitin\\" is a song written by Hank Williams and released as the B-side of \\"Men with Broken Hearts\\" in 1951 on MGM Records.

The whimsical song ponders the futility of human expectations and contains humorous, cynical wordplay like, \\"The congregation's waitin' for the preacher, preacher just waitin' for the groom, the groom's just waitin' for the June bride, and bride's just waitin' for June.\\" Williams biographer Colin Escott takes a dim view of the song, stating that it \\"promised more than it delivered...It was a good premise, but a bad song.\\" Williams recorded it on December 21, 1950 in at Castle Studio in Nashville - the same session that produced \\"Cold, Cold Heart\\" - with Fred Rose producing.

The novel was written over the course of eighteen months. Despite the length and difficult subject matter it became a bestseller. Plot summary The novel follows the lives of four friends in New York City from college through to middle-age. It focuses particularly on Jude, a lawyer with a mysterious past, ambiguous ethnicity, and unexplained health issues. Jude walks with a limp and suffers from severe nerve damage in his spine that causes him great pain, which he blames on a car injury he sustained as a child. Unbeknownst to the rest of the group, he also habitually self-harms. The rest of the group includes Malcolm, a struggling architect from a wealthy biracial family who still lives at home; JB, a painter of Haitian descent; and Willem, an aspiring actor whom Jude is closest with due to their both being orphans. After graduation, Jude and Willem share a one-bedroom apartment due to their relative poverty compared to their friends. Despite this apparent closeness with his friends, Jude finds himself unable to divulge either details of his past or current state of mind to his roommate. Nonetheless, he thrives in his law practice and develops a close parent-child relationship with his former professor, Harold, and his wife Julia, which results in the pair adopting him when Jude turns thirty. While thankful, the time before the adoption is filled with further bouts of self-harm as Jude believes he is inherently unworthy of affection. Meanwhile, the rest of the group finds success in their respective fields, with Willem becoming a star of theater and then film. JB finds success as an artist but also becomes addicted to crystal meth. The group stages an intervention, where JB mocks Jude by doing a crude imitation of his limp. In spite of successful treatment and a great deal of apologizing, Jude finds it impossible to forgive JB. Willem refuses to forgive him too, causing the group to fragment, with only Malcolm remaining friends with all four members. It becomes clear that Jude was sexually traumatized at a very young age, making it difficult for him to engage in romantic relationships. His friends and loved ones begin questioning this isolation as he enters his forties, with Willem especially being baffled with regards to Jude's sexuality. As his loneliness grows more intense, he enters an abusive relationship with fashion executive Caleb, who is disgusted by Jude's limp and his increasing use of a wheelchair. Jude finally breaks off the relationship after Caleb rapes him, and they meet a final time when Caleb follows him to a dinner with Harold, humiliates him, and then follows Jude to his apartment where he brutally beats and rapes him, leaving him for dead. Jude nonetheless refuses to report the incident to the police, believing he deserved it. Only Harold and Andy, Jude's doctor and ongoing confidante, know the truth of the failed relationship. Although Jude's body manages to heal, the rapes cause him to flashback to his childhood wherein he was raised in a monastery and repeatedly sexually abused by the brothers. He recalls a period when one of the brothers, Brother Luke, ran away with him, forcing him into years of child prostitution. After he was rescued by the police, Jude was placed in state care, where the abuse continued at the hands of the counselors there. After the break-up with Caleb brings back this childhood trauma, Jude finally decides to kill himself, but he survives the attempt. In the aftermath, Willem comes back home and begins to live with him. Jude continues to refuse therapy but begins to tell Willem the least traumatic stories about his childhood, which Willem finds disturbing and horrifying. The two soon begin a relationship, but Jude continues to struggle with opening up, and does not enjoy having sex with him. In an attempt to curb his cutting, Jude decides to instead burn himself as a form of self-harm, but accidentally inflicts third degree burns that requires a skin graft. The wound is so severe that Andy tells him he has to tell Willem what happened, or else he will do it for him. Before Jude can tell Willem, Andy accidentally divulges the information. Willem is horrified, but after a difficult fight, Jude finally confesses that he does not enjoy sex and tells Willem about the years of sexual and physical abuse he endured. He also reveals that the damage to his legs was caused by a man called Dr. Traylor, who picked him up after he ran away from state care at age 15 and held him captive, eventually running him over with his car. The relationship continues, with Willem sleeping with women and not with Jude. The two settle into a comfortable life together, which is shaken when Jude's legs become worse, and he must reluctantly amputate. He manages to learn to walk again with his new prosthetics, and the pair enter a period of their life which Willem dubs \\"The Happy Years\\". However, while picking up Malcolm and his wife from the train station for a visit, Willem is involved in a car accident with a drunk driver which kills all three occupants. With his two closest friends dead, Jude descends once again into self-destructive habits, losing such an excessive amount of weight that his remaining loved ones stage another intervention. Though they are able to get him to gain weight and to attend therapy, years of depression and despair finally overtake Jude and he commits suicide. Structure A Little Life is divided into seven separate parts, and follows a chronological narrative with flashbacks frequently interspersed throughout. The novel's narrative perspectives shift throughout the story's progression. During the beginning of the novel, a third person omniscient perspective privileging one of Jude's, Willem's, JB's, or Malcolm's thoughts is utilized. As the story gradually shifts its focus towards Jude, its perspective progressively molds entirely around each character's interactions with Jude and the experiences of Jude himself. This literary perspective is punctuated by first person narratives told from an unspecified future by an older Harold. Themes Male relationships A core focus of the novel is the evolution of the relationships between Jude, Willem, JB, Malcolm, and Jude's adoptive father Harold. Jude's life in particular is populated by men who love and care about him as well as men that exploit and abuse him, and those who fall in the liminal spaces between the two categories. The social and emotional lives of each male character are the fabric that weaves the novel together, creating an insular narrative bubble that provides few clues about the historical moment in which the story is situated. Yanagihara confines the reader's perspective and emphasizes the examination of the distinct interior lives of each character and the people that populate and influence their lives. There are few women dispersed throughout the story, as a result, the novel can be considered a rumination on the strengths and the limits of romantic love, friendship, and relationships among men. Despite the various iterations of relationships and attempts to connect with Jude, his existence is often stagnated by isolation and loneliness in dealing with trauma and pain. His few attempts to reach out and connect with others during his adult life manifest in the repetition of yet another cycle of sexual abuse and trauma ‚Äì his relationship with Caleb. The flashbacks to his abusive experiences with Dr. Traylor, Brother Luke, and boy's home counselors demonstrate the moral and affective extremes of abuse and exploitation that he experiences. Yet the novel invites juxtaposition by way of narration from Harold who shows a father's unconditional benevolent love to his adopted son. Trauma, recovery, and support In an article written for New York Magazine, Yanagihara states that ‚Äúone of the things [she] wanted to do with this book was create a protagonist who never got better‚Ä¶ [for him] to begin healthy (or appear so) and end sick ‚Äì both the main character and the plot itself‚Äù. The first sixteen years of Jude's life, plagued by sexual, physical, and psychological abuse, continue to haunt him as he enters adulthood. His trauma directly affects his mental and physical health, relationships, beliefs, and the ways in which he navigates the world. He struggles to move beyond the damage the past has wrought upon his body and psyche. Other than Ana, Jude's deceased case manager who predates the novel's beginning, and Willem later in the novel, he divulges almost none of his past to those close to him. The failure to understand Jude's trauma and the subsequent frustration that stems from his inability to build mutual networks of support among his friends and family is a constant point of tension in the novel. Jude's friends, including Andy, are constantly plagued by doubts about the ethical choices such as allowing Jude to live independently while harboring the knowledge of his physically self-destructive behavior. Throughout the novel, Jude constantly apologizes for his actions and inability to take the help that would be given to him. Chronic pain, disability, and self-harm A Little Life depicts the everyday experience of living with trauma, chronic pain, and disability, demonstrating the inherent intersections with one another. As a direct result of Dr. Traylor running him over with a car, Jude's spinal injuries have long- term health effects that trouble him for the rest of his life. He is prone to episodes of intense pain due to severed nerves in his back, lesions forming on his legs, and has difficulty walking. His insistent inclination towards independence manifests in the ways he constantly resists and fights his body as it breaks down with age, despite numerous treatments and surgeries. Jude continually attempts to take control of his body and his emotions by self- harming. His life is structured around pain and the anticipation of pain. As Jude grows older, he loathes the increasing dependence he must have on devices such as wheelchairs, canes, and relying on the care of others. Reception Review aggregator website Book Marks reported three negative and three mixed reviews among 22 total, signifying positive critical response. On the site, 11 critics gave the book a rave review, whilst the remaining 5 expressed positive impressions. The novel received positive reviews from The New Yorker, The Atlantic, The Wall Street Journal, and other publications. In The Atlantic, Garth Greenwell suggested that A Little Life is \\"the long-awaited gay novel\\": \\"It engages with aesthetic modes long coded as queer: melodrama, sentimental fiction, grand opera. By violating the canons of current literary taste, by embracing melodrama and exaggeration and sentiment, it can access emotional truth denied more modest means of expression.\\" In the London Review of Books, Christian Lorentzen referred to the main character's \\"gothic inverted fairytale origins\\" and \\"ghastly litany of childhood sexual abuse.\\" The characters, he wrote, \\"seem like stereotypical middle-class strivers plucked out of 1950s cinema.\\" He asked in regard to a minor character who became a crystal meth addict, \\"What real person trapped in this novel wouldn't become a drug addict?\\"Lorentzen, Christian (24 September 2015) \\"Sessions with a Poker.\\" London Review of Books. Page 32-33. Yanagihara appeared on Late Night with Seth Meyers to discuss the book. In July 2015, the book was long-listed for the Man Booker Prize and made the shortlist of six books in September 2015.

Produced by DC Films and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, it is a reboot of the Batman film franchise. The film is directed by Matt Reeves, who wrote the screenplay with Peter Craig. It stars Robert Pattinson as Bruce Wayne / Batman, with Zo√´ Kravitz, Paul Dano, Jeffrey Wright, John Turturro, Peter Sarsgaard, Barry Keoghan, Jayme Lawson, Andy Serkis, and Colin Farrell rounding out the ensemble cast. The Batman is set during Batman's second year of fighting crime and follows him as he explores Gotham City's corruption and faces the Riddler, a riddle-obsessed serial killer. After he was cast as Batman in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016), Ben Affleck began developing a DC Extended Universe (DCEU) Batman film with Geoff Johns, and was attached to direct, write, produce, and star. In January 2017, Affleck stepped down from directing and writing after struggling with the story and so he could focus on playing Batman. Reeves took over directorial and scripting duties the following month and reworked the story to focus on a younger Batman, hoping to emphasize the detective aspect of the character to a greater extent than previous films. Affleck stepped down from all involvement in January 2019, and Pattinson was cast the following May. The film's connections to the DCEU were subsequently eliminated. Principal photography began in London, England in January 2020 but was suspended in March due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Production resumed in early September, but was halted again a few days later after Pattinson tested positive for COVID-19 and resumed after two weeks with Pattinson safely returning. The Batman is scheduled to be released in the United States on March 4, 2022. Its release was delayed twice from an initial June 2021 date due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Two sequels are planned, while a spin-off prequel television series is in development for HBO Max.  Premise  In his second year of fighting crime, Batman explores the corruption that plagues Gotham City and how it may tie to his own family, in addition to coming into conflict with a serial killer known as the Riddler.  Cast  * Robert Pattinson as Bruce Wayne / Batman: A billionaire socialite and heir of Wayne Enterprises who dedicates himself to protecting Gotham City from its criminal underworld as a masked vigilante. Batman is around 30 years old in the film and neither an experienced superhero nor a beginner as a crime fighter. Director Matt Reeves stated: \\"I just felt like well, what I'd love to do is to get a version of this Batman character where he's not yet fully formed. Where there's something to do in this context with who that guy would be in this world today, and to ground him in all of these broken ways. Because at the end of the day, this guy is doing all of this to deal with trauma in his past.\\" Pattinson described his Batman as flawed, unlike traditional comic book characters, finding the character's lack of superpowers interesting, and said his voice was inspired by that of his co- star Willem Dafoe's in the film The Lighthouse (2019). In preparation, Pattinson trained in Brazilian jiu-jitsu with instructor and John Wick alumnus Rigan Machado, and said that he wanted to \\"learn and achieve\\" something new with the role as a different character from himself and to undergo physical change, citing actors from superhero films including Chris Hemsworth, Dwayne Johnson, Robert Downey Jr., and Chris Evans as pioneers of this within the genre and an influence for taking the part in new ways. * Zo√´ Kravitz as Selina Kyle / Catwoman: A cat burglar. Kravitz said that in contrast to Batman, who represents masculinity, Catwoman represents femininity, and \\"femininity represents power, and I think it's a different kind of power than masculine power... slightly more complicated, and softer, too.\\" Kravitz drew inspiration from Michelle Pfeiffer, who portrayed the character in Batman Returns (1992), and read the \\"Year One\\" (1987) Batman story arc in preparation. She previously voiced the character in The Lego Batman Movie (2017). * Paul Dano as Edward Nashton / Riddler: A newly emerged criminal who is obsessed with riddles. In The Batman, the character is portrayed as a serial killer, drawing comparisons to the Zodiac Killer. According to Reeves, the Riddler will serve as the film's primary antagonist. * Jeffrey Wright as James Gordon: An ally of Batman in the Gotham City Police Department. Wright is the first actor of color to portray the character. * John Turturro as Carmine Falcone: A Gotham City crime lord. * Peter Sarsgaard as Gil Colson: Gotham's district attorney. * Barry Keoghan as Stanley Merkel: An officer in the Gotham City Police Department. * Jayme Lawson as Bella Re√°l: A mayoral candidate in Gotham. * Andy Serkis as Alfred Pennyworth: Batman's butler and mentor. * Colin Farrell as Oswald \\"Oz\\" Cobblepot / Penguin: A rising crime lord. According to Reeves, the film is set at a time when Cobblepot dislikes being referred to as the Penguin. For the role, Farrell gained weight and wore prosthetic-based makeup. Additionally, Alex Ferns portrays Commissioner Pete Savage, while Rupert Penry-Jones, Gil Perez- Abraham, and twins Charlie and Max Carver have been cast in undisclosed roles.  Production   Development  In August 2013, Ben Affleck was cast as Bruce Wayne / Batman in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU), with plans to play the role in at least three films. He made his debut in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016), and later appeared in Suicide Squad (2016) and Justice League (2017). In October 2014, Warner Bros. revealed plans for a standalone Batman film starring Affleck, and by July 2015, he was in negotiations to direct and co-write the screenplay with Geoff Johns. According to Deadline Hollywood, Affleck and Johns were expected to turn in a draft by October 2015, and that production would begin after Affleck finished work on Live by Night. Affleck and Johns finished the first draft in March 2016, with Johns implying that the film would explore the death of Robin which was hinted at in Batman v Superman. At CinemaCon in April, Warner Bros. CEO Kevin Tsujihara confirmed the film was moving forward, with Affleck directing. In the following months, Jeremy Irons and Joe Manganiello were confirmed to appear‚Äîwith Manganiello playing Deathstroke‚Äîand Jared Leto expressed interest in reprising his role as the Joker from Suicide Squad. Affleck revealed the title of the film was The Batman in October, and in December he said filming was on track to begin in mid-2017 for a release date in 2018. That month, a planned Justice League sequel was delayed to accommodate The Batman. However, in January 2017, Affleck said the film had no script and that he may end up not directing it. While Affleck reaffirmed his commitment to direct in an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, by the end of the month he decided to step down; nonetheless, he stated he would still star and produce. By this point, Chris Terrio had turned in a rewrite of the script. Affleck initially cited his intentions to step down as director were to focus more on starring as Batman, later acknowledging that after various attempts to get the script where he wanted it, it simply became \\"time to let someone else have a shot at it\\". Borys Kit of The Hollywood Reporter added that Affleck's film was \\"sidelined\\" after Warner Bros. began re-evaluating its approach to superhero films. Matt Ross, Ridley Scott, and Fede √Ålvarez were considered to replace Affleck, before Matt Reeves joined to direct and produce in February 2017, and production was delayed until 2018 so he could complete War for the Planet of the Apes. By March, Reeves had begun working on a completely new script, and would not meet potential actors until at least July. In August, Reeves said the film would still take place within the DCEU, but that \\"it wouldn't be filled with cameos servicing other stories\\". After Reeves began rewriting the script, Manganiello said he was unsure if Deathstroke would still appear. In August 2018, Reeves appeared on a Television Critics Association panel and revealed many details about the film. He confirmed that The Batman would be an original, noir-driven story and not an origin story. He also revealed that the script was nearing completion and that the film's connections to the DCEU would be minimal. Reeves said that he was \\"working on getting our draft in the next couple of weeks and things are progressing,\\" hoping to begin production in early-to-mid 2019. Reeves submitted his first draft to Warner Bros. the following month. Affleck's involvement was in doubt; Kim Masters of The Hollywood Reporter reported in July 2017 that Warner Bros. was looking to replace him. This was strengthened by further reports indicating that Reeves wanted a younger actor to play Batman. In August 2018, Affleck went to rehabilitation for alcohol abuse, casting further doubt that he would be reprising his role. In January 2019, Warner Bros. set a June 25, 2021 release date for The Batman, and Affleck confirmed that he was departing. Affleck revealed in 2020 that he stepped down due to a combination of factors, including his divorce from Jennifer Garner, the tumultuous production of Justice League, his personal lack of enjoyment in the role, and his alcohol problems. \\"I showed [my friend] the Batman script,\\" he recalled. \\"They said, 'I think the script is good. I also think you'll drink yourself to death if you go through what you just went through again.\\" = Writing = When Affleck was writing The Batman, it was intended to be set after the events of Batman v Superman and Justice League. Affleck said his film would feature a \\"mostly original\\" story that used elements of comic books for inspiration, like what director Zack Snyder did with Batman v Superman. According to Robert Richardson, who was attached as cinematographer early in development, Affleck's script was set in Arkham Asylum and dealt with insanity. When Reeves took over writing duties, he reworked the story to focus on Batman earlier in his career as a vigilante and sought to explore the detective aspect of the character to a greater extent than previous films. Reeves stated in an interview that the film would feature \\"an almost-noir driven, detective version of Batman\\" emphasizing the heart and mind of the character and taking inspiration from Alfred Hitchcock. Reeves stated that he aimed to make a film that seemed believable, and said that Chinatown, The French Connection, and Taxi Driver were sources of inspiration. Another critical influence was Batman: Ego, a 2000 story by Darwyn Cooke and Jon Babcock that explores Batman's psychology. The film is set during the same timeframe as \\"Year Two\\", a 1987 Detective Comics storyline written by Mike W. Barr and illustrated by Alan Davis, Paul Neary, Alfredo Alcala, Mark Farmer, and Todd McFarlane. Reeves stated the villains are in the beginning of their evolution into iconic characters.  Pre-production  Robert Pattinson (pictured in 2017) was cast to replace Affleck in May 2019 By May 2019, Robert Pattinson, Nicholas Hoult, Armie Hammer, and Aaron Taylor-Johnson were on the shortlist to replace Affleck as Batman, Pattinson being the frontrunner. Reeves began to consider Pattinson early in development, but was unsure if he would want to take the part and did not contact him. Pattinson had avoided major franchises since his Twilight films, wanting to avoid paparazzi and finding those roles to be dull. His avoidance of \\"big studio franchise films\\" meant he had not appeared in any of rival Marvel Studios' projects, something that made him desirable to Warner Bros. Hoult was the other major contender for the role. While Hoult had appeared in the Marvel Comics-based X-Men films, those did not take place in Marvel Studios' Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), and, as Kit noted, \\"Hoult spent large chunks of those movies unrecognizable\\" due to his makeup. Reeves \\"spent hours poring over the two actors' work\\", and in April met with them both. By May 20, they were the only contenders, and both flew to Burbank, California for a screen test. Reeves, who \\"wanted very specific things\\" for the role, chose Pattinson, and on May 31, Pattinson was cast. Pattinson signed on to play Batman because he was interested in the character's lack of superpowers. News of Pattinson's casting leaked shortly before he screen-tested, with Pattinson recalling: \\"I was fucking furious. Everyone was so upset. Everyone was panicking from my team. I sort of thought that had blown up the whole thing.\\" The casting was also met with backlash from Batman fans‚Äîwith some setting up a Change.org petition to have it reversed‚Äîbut Pattinson said he found responses \\"less vitriolic than I was expecting [...] it's much more fun when you're an underdog. There's no expectation of you.\\" Christian Bale, who played Batman in The Dark Knight Trilogy (2005‚Äì2012), supported Pattinson, encouraging him to \\"make [the role] his own\\" and ignore critics. Pattinson also received advice from The Dark Knight Trilogy director, Christopher Nolan, whom he worked with on Tenet (2020). Jeffrey Wright entered negotiations to play James Gordon in September, and Jonah Hill entered negotiations to play either the Riddler or the Penguin. In October, Wright was cast, but Hill exited negotiations. According to Variety Justin Kroll, Hill wanted to be paid $10 million‚Äîmore than double the amount that Pattinson would make‚Äîwhile Kit wrote that Warner Bros. and Hill could not decide which role he would take. Also in October, Zo√´ Kravitz was cast as Selina Kyle / Catwoman, after previously voicing the character in The Lego Batman Movie (2017), following a screen test with Pattinson; Kravitz was chosen over a number of actresses, including Ana de Armas, Ella Balinska, and Eiza Gonz√°lez, who also auditioned for the role, and Zazie Beetz and Alicia Vikander. Paul Dano was cast as the Riddler shortly afterward. It was also revealed that Mattson Tomlin had joined the project to co-write the screenplay with Reeves. In November, Andy Serkis, Colin Farrell, and John Turturro were cast as Alfred Pennyworth, the Penguin, and Carmine Falcone, respectively. Jayme Lawson also joined the cast as a politician, while Peter Sarsgaard was cast in December.  Filming  Principal photography began in January 2020 in London, under the working title Vengeance. Later in the month, Warner Bros. confirmed the main cast; Gil Perez-Abraham was revealed to have a role in February, as were Charlie and Max Carver in March. Greig Fraser is serving as cinematographer, reuniting with Reeves after they worked together on Let Me In (2010). Scenes at a cemetery were filmed at the Glasgow Necropolis in mid- February. In March, Warner Bros. decided to move production to Liverpool, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Unlike other studios with films in production, Warner Bros. did not plan to suspend shooting on The Batman, but eventually did so for two weeks on March 14. On March 25, Reeves announced that filming had been suspended indefinitely, with plans to resume once it was safe to do so. Shortly afterward, the production's dialect coach, Andrew Jack, died from COVID-19. Variety reported that production was unlikely to restart until around mid-May, and that the release date was expected to be delayed as a result. In April, Warner Bros. pushed the release date back until October 1, 2021. Reeves stated that around a quarter of the film had been shot prior to suspension, and that he had been taking time to look over what had already been shot and think about \\"what's to come.\\" Reeves said that he was not planning to perform script rewrites in the meantime, but was using the opportunity to explore the film's tone. On May 12, the British government gave the green light for high-end TV and film productions to resume shooting, as soon as employers put coronavirus safety measures in place, and The Batman was given permission to restart production around July. By August, production was expected to resume in early September at Warner Bros. Studios Leavesden in Hertfordshire, England. At DC FanDome in August 2020, DC Films president Walter Hamada confirmed that the film was no longer part of the DCEU, but took place in a different universe within DC Film's multiverse. It was also revealed that Peter Craig had contributed to the script and that Barry Keoghan had been cast as Stanley Merkel. By September 3, filming had resumed for three days at Leavesden Studios, only to be put on pause again after Pattinson tested positive for COVID-19. The filming crew then entered a two-week quarantine, after which filming was set to resume, while construction on the sets and props at Leavesden Studios continued. Filming resumed on September 17, after Pattinson was cleared to return. At this point, the film had approximately three more months of filming and was expected to finish by the end of 2020. Filming is limited to England, and crew members are required to live close to the production area and not leave to the surrounding community. In early October, the film's release was pushed back to March 4, 2022, due to the production delays. Filming resumed with Pattinson for scenes of a funeral at St George's Hall in Liverpool during the following week, with the location doubling for Gotham City Hall. Set photos of the shoot revealed Rupert Penry- Jones had a role in the film. Later, filming also took place within Liverpool at Anfield Cemetery and the Royal Liver Building. Industrial Light & Magic began providing the same virtual production technology used on the Disney+ Star Wars series The Mandalorian for certain scenes in the film, with a wall of LED panels surrounding already built practical sets in the United Kingdom constructed to use the technology. The ILM team worked with Fraser for these scenes. Exterior shots for Gotham City will be filmed in Chicago in the middle of the month.  Music  In October 2019, Reeves announced that his frequent collaborator Michael Giacchino would be composing the film's score. Later that month, Giacchino confirmed that he had already finished writing the main theme because he was so excited to do so. In film production, the music is not written until later, but since Giacchino wrote the music early on, he and Reeves were able to use it in promotional materials. Giacchino said he \\"felt total freedom to do whatever I want. Matt always agreed, this is our Batman, this is our vision. In the same way that I always loved, what I still do about Batman comics and graphic novels is that each of these artists, each of these authors, they take their own crack at what they want this to be. It's their version of Batman.\\"  Marketing  On February 13, 2020, Reeves released \\"moody, red-saturated\\" test footage revealing Pattinson in his Batman costume and Giacchino's theme. The one-minute video generated a great deal of speculation and discussion of what approach the film would take in depicting Batman's world. Chris Evangelista of /Film thought Pattinson \\"looks much different than any onscreen Batman we've seen before\\", while Richard Newby of The Hollywood Reporter identified the Batsuit's various references to previous incarnations. Newby also noted that the bat emblem on the costume's chest bore a resemblance to a pistol, and wondered if it was the pistol used to kill Batman's parents in his origin story. The footage's use of the color red also led to discussion of how The Batman would differ tonally from previous Batman adaptations. On March 4, 2020, Reeves released an image of the film's Batmobile. Dino-Ray Ramos of Deadline Hollywood opined that it \\"seems sexier and more streamlined than Batmobiles from the past\\" and \\"gives off some serious James Bond-meets-Fast and Furious energy and seems right on point for Pattinson.\\" Reeves released a teaser trailer on August 22, 2020, during the virtual DC FanDome convention. The trailer, according to CNET, \\"set the internet on fire\\" and was noted for its somber, grim tone. Adam Chitwood of Collider praised the trailer for showing off \\"the genuinely refreshing approach\\" the film seemed to be taking in depicting the world of Batman.  Release  The Batman is scheduled to be released by Warner Bros. Pictures in the United States on March 4, 2022. It was originally scheduled to be released on June 25, 2021, but was pushed back to October 1, 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, before it was delayed to the March 2022 date after Dune was moved to the prior date.  Future  Possible sequels The Batman is intended to be the first of a Batman film trilogy. In November 2019, Kroll and Brent Lang of Variety reported that key cast members are signed on to reprise their roles in future DC films.  Spin-off series  In July 2020, HBO Max began developing a spin-off police procedural drama television series that would be written by Reeves and Terence Winter and centered on the Gotham City Police Department, sharing continuity with the film. The series was intended \\"to build on the film's examination of the anatomy of corruption in Gotham City\\". Reeves and Winter will executive produce the series, along with Daniel Pipski, Adam Kassan, and Dylan Clark. The Hollywood Reporter reported that it was unclear if actors such as Wright and Pattinson would reprise their roles for the series. In August 2020, during the DC FanDome event, it was revealed that the series would be set during Batman's first year of crime-fighting, from the perspective of a corrupt GCPD officer.

Background View of downtown Toulon and Mediterranean Sea from Mount Faron Toulon was the main port for the French Navy (, \\"national navy\\"), informally . On 27 November 1942, German troops had attacked the port, with the intention of seizing the French fleet, the subsequent fight lasted just long enough to scuttle the 75 warships, the pride of France. After the successful execution of Operation Overlord, the Normandy landings, attention shifted to the south. Most ports in the north were unusable, or too heavily fortified (e.g. Cherbourg, Brest, Lorient, Saint Nazaire), which made seizure and control of the French ports at Marseille and Toulon increasingly attractive.Yeide (2007), p. 14 The French leaders pressed for an invasion in southern France, too. Finally, after many delays, on 14 July, Operation Dragoon was authorized by the Allied Combined Chiefs of Staff.Yeide (2007), p. 13Zaloga (2009), p. 6-7 Toulon was not a good target for an amphibious assault, it was well defended from a seaborne assault, so it would have to be taken from the land. The land approaches were also defended. A 700m high hill provided excellent artillery and observation positions. Ridges nearby were protected by French pillboxes. In 1941-2, as a token of goodwill to the Germans, the Government of Vichy France strengthened the defences. These defences were strengthened further by the Germans who took equipment off the scuttled French fleet ships, installing two 340mm turrets and 75 medium-sized guns along the coast. On 13 August as part of Operation Nutmeg, the 17th Bombardment Group attacked Toulon Harbour twice, with Martin B-26 Marauder aircraft, experiencing heavy anti aircraft fire. The groundwork was laid by the Allied invasion of southern France in Operation Dragoon on 15 August by the United States Seventh Army under General Patch, with support from the French First Army. Patch gave the order to General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny to take the cities of Toulon and Marseille, which were to be attacked simultaneously with de Larminat in charge of attacking Toulon. 15 August-13 September 1944 The German troops around Toulon were the 242nd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht) who set up a defensive line east of Toulon.Under Hitler's orders, they were to defend Toulon to the last man and, if defeat was inevitable, destroy the harbour. Hansen, Randall (2014). Disobeying Hitler: German Resistance After Operation Valkyrie, p. 133. The German troops took the opportunity to try to scuttle the remaining ships in Toulon harbour, including the battleship Strasbourg and the cruiser La Galissonni√®re, both which had been refloated, with the plan to block the southern channel, but American bombers sank them first. On 16 August the 17th Bombardment Group returned with the object of destroying the heavy guns. This was not a task appreciated by the crews, who had experienced the very heavy flak already. There would be a total of 28 raids against the submarine pens and artillery batteries, in which eight B-26 were lost and 125 damaged. The result was five dents to the defensive batteries. The 242nd Division was involved in fighting against the left wing of the Allied force, until on 18 August the remnants retired into Toulon. The original plan for the capture of Toulon was for the 3rd Algerian Infantry Division to attack from the north followed by the . There would be distraction and flanking protection provided by other units. The attack to be made on 24 August. Given the success of the Allied invasion, de Lattre decided to move ahead with the liberation of Toulon rather than wait for the second wave of Allied landings and started the move on 18 August with the troops that were available. Sixteen thousand fighters went into battle with thirty tanks and a few artillery batteries. The mission was given to the 3 Algerian in the north, and the 1st Free French Division in the south with support from the 1st Armored Division and the . The center was given to the . Larminat was in command of 52,000 troops of the 2nd Army Corps, chiefly from the 1st Free French Division and the 9th CID. On 20 August 3 Algerian reached the suburbs at Mont Faron and on the 21st Toulon was surrounded. That evening 3 Algerian moved into the town streets. To the east, German troops used old French tanks in their defence. It took time, but by 23 August French troops were everywhere in the city, raising the tricolour and there was a steady stream of prisoners. During the 24th the last German defences were taken together with 1,000 prisoners. The Naval base was now attacked. Heavy fighting and artillery barrages began to tell with first one fort then others surrendering. A victory parade was held on the 27th to the sound of German artillery guns still firing on the attackers, including the 340mm guns. Attempts by the Germans to flee by sea on August 27 were met by American ships. One vessel escaped, another was captured, and the remaining four were sunk. Hansen, Randall (2014). Disobeying Hitler: German Resistance After Operation Valkyrie, p. 140. At 2245 the German commander, Admiral Ruhfus agreed to an unconditional surrender. The garrison of 1,880 marched out next day. None of the German positions had shown the level of fanaticism that Hitler demanded, and by September 13 the harbour was repaired well enough to receive ships. Hansen, Randall (2014). Disobeying Hitler: German Resistance After Operation Valkyrie, p. 141. Aftermath One German corpse laying on the streets of Toulon, photography of Laurence Le Guay. The nine-day battle had cost 2,700 casualties for which they had taken 17,000 prisoners and captured the vast naval base. The liberation of the city of Marseilles, which was running in parallel with the fighting in Toulon was achieved when the Germans surrendered on 28 August. The Battle of Provence was won more than 60 days ahead of schedule. After the war General Charles de Gaulle was to claim that the battle for France was also the battle of Frenchmen for France, it was he who ensured that de Lattre and Leclerc had been in defining moments in the \\"Liberation of France\\", it was they who had driven into Marseilles, Paris and Toulon. Today the Naval Base is the main home of the French Navy, including the aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle, the flagship of the fleet. Bibliography * .

The band consists of members Joe Parella (lead vocals, guitar), Jozii Cowell (guitar), Jon Rodney (bass), and Christopher Donofrio (drums).  History  The members of Deal Casino originally started playing together in elementary school, eventually forming a band called Something About January. After a lineup change and some massive changes in their writing process and their approach to music, the band renamed itself after the well-known Jersey beach club, The Deal Casino Bathing Pavilion , after an episode in which they waited for hours there in preparation for the 2013 Bamboozle Music Festival. The Deal Casino gets its name from an infamous shore town whose residents include people like movie theater magnate Walter Reade and Genovese crime family underboss Willie Moretti. Deal Casino has averaged a show a week since their formation in 2013. Joe Parella, the band's front man, provides lead vocals and plays guitar. The rest of the band consists of Jozii Cowell (guitar), Jon Rodney (guitar), Christopher Donofrio (drums). All are from Sparta, NJ, and were barely 20 years old when they formed the band. All decided to move to live and work in the heart of the Asbury Park music scene. Joe Parella works at the recording studio where they practice and the others work in restaurants/florists. Deal Casino played The Saint for 12 weeks in the Summer of 2014 during their initiation to the Asbury Park, New Jersey music scene. The shows were recorded, and the band reported watching them the next day, taking notes, analyzing them, and planning their improvement like a sports team. By December 2014, Deal Casino dominated the Asbury Park Music Awards, drawing comparisons with early Smashing Pumpkins and winning more awards than any other group, including Best Pop/Rock Band, Best Vocalist, and Best Live Performance. The band's sound has been described as \\"urgent, groove- heavy\\" and a \\"boisterous, bouncing rock sound not so far from Neon Trees or Young the Giant,\\" though some object to this characterization. Parella's style has been described as similar to Trees vocalist Tyler Glenn. They have kept the sound very raw to achieve a live, stark, but polished sound. Their early sound was characterized by contrasts between subdued, mellow, and loud, anthem-like sounds. Their lyrics have been described as raw, confessional, and picturesque, similar to those of Arcade Fire and Klaxons. Deal Casino has been described as \\"an explosive live act, ramping up and tearing around the stage as if possessed.\\" In September 2020, Parella announced via a post on the band's official Instagram page that, as of early 2020, Deal Casino was no longer a band, with Cowell and Rodney going separate ways, albeit \\"on good terms and as friends.\\" Parella continues to make music independently.

Its seat was Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne. In the 6th century, King Guntram raised the church of Maurienne into an episcopal see. In 753, Grifo was defeated by the forces of Pepin the Short in the valley on his way to Italy. The county was bestowed upon Humbert the White-Handed in 1032 for his assistance in Conrad the Salian's Italian campaigns against Aribert, archbishop of Milan. He was buried in Saint-Jean's cathedral. Along with Savoy proper (Sapaudia), this formed the nucleus of the county of Savoy which developed into the kingdoms of Sardinia and Italy under Humbert's dynasty. Maurienne continued to be noted in the formal titles of the Sardinian and Italian kings. During the unification of Italy, however, the Maurienne Valley itself was ceded to Napoleon III's France, where it now forms the commune of Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne. Subordinate to the counts were hereditary viscounts at Aiguebelle and La Chambre, who held the power of low justice over their subjects.Eugene L. Cox, The Eagles of Savoy: The House of Savoy in Thirteenth-Century Europe (Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1974), p. 322. High justice (jurisdiction over capital crimes) was reserved to the counts. In 1240, the count acquired the estates of Pierre Guigue du Villar in order to better control access to the Col du Mont-Cenis. The counts also built a castle Hermillon, from which their castellans could monitor events in Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne, where the bishop held secular authority.Cox, The Eagles of Savoy, p. 219.

She abruptly took a break in the succeeding years but picked it up again during high school. She was later recruited by Coach Ramil De Jesus for the DLSU Lady Spikers varsity team and played for the team from 2005 to 2012. Her first three years in her collegiate career was a shaky journey. Midway during her UAAP rookie year (Season 68, 2005-2006), while doing the setting job for the team, she sustained a stress fracture in her left ankle which forced her to sit out the remaining games of the season. While in the following UAAP season (Season 69, 2006-07), all DLSU varsity teams were suspended from the athletic association as consequence of its men's basketball team's violation on a UAAP rule. In UAAP Season 70 (2007-08), Cruz-Behag failed to suit up for the team due to academic requirements. In 2008, Cruz finally returned to suit up for the team this time playing the open spiker and middle blocker positions. The DLSU Lady Spikers only dropped two matches in UAAP Season 71 (2008-2009) winning the championship title over the Far Eastern Lady Tamaraws.https://tiebreakertimes.com.ph/tbt/greater-good-cha-cruz-story/22072 However, in Season 72 (2009-10), the DLSU Lady Spikers were dethroned by the University of Sto. Tomas (UST) Lady Tigers and finished as runner up.https://tiebreakertimes.com.ph/tbt/greater-good-cha-cruz-story/22072 In her last two UAAP seasons [Seasons 73 (2010-11) and 74 (2011-12)], Cruz was named team captain for the DLSU Lady Spikers. In both seasons, the team won the championships and Cruz was awarded the UAAP Finals Most Valuable Player for both seasons. Eventually, the back-to-back championships turned into a 3-peat as the DLSU Lady Spikers again won the UAAP Women's Volleyball championship in Season 75. After exhausting her UAAP playing years, Cruz temporarily took a break from playing volleyball and focused on her teaching job.https://sports.abs-cbn.com/sportslifestyle/news/2015/07/30/catching- teacher-cha-cruz-3714, She is currently finishing her master's degree in education major in special education at De La Salle University. After a two- year hiatus, in 2014, Cruz made a comeback via the now defunct AirAsia Flying Spikers, reuniting with Coach Ramil de Jesus and other DLSU Lady Spikers. Currently, she is the team captain of the F2 Logistics Cargo Movers in the Philippine Super Liga.

Biography Born on 2 February 1932 in Sant Fruit√≥s de Bages, Catalonia, Spain, Espinal aspired to be a priest since he was a child. Espinal was educated at the minor seminary of San Jose in Roquetes, Baix Ebre between 1944 and 1949. He joined the Society of Jesus of Veruela, Zaragoza in 1949, made his perpetual vows in 1951, and studied Humanities and Greco-Roman Literature (1951‚Äì53) there. He studied Philosophy at the Facultad Eclesi√°stica of San Cugat del Vall√©s from 1953 to 1956. While doing another licenciate course in Philosophy at the Universidad Civil de Barcelona, Espinal gave classes of Greek literature and Latin poetry to Jesuits. He studied Theology (1959‚Äì63) at the Facultad Eclesi√°stica of San Cugat del Vall√©s, and was ordained priest in 1962. He later obtained a degree in film and television from the Italian Universit√† Cattolica del Sacro Cuore (1964‚Äì65). Espinal moved to La Paz, Bolivia as a missionary in 1968. In Bolivia, he lived alongside the families of miners during the dictatorship of Luis Garc√≠a Meza. There, he was a human-rights activist, and cofounded the Permanent Assembly for Human Rights. In the headquarters of the newspaper Presencia he joined a December 1977 hunger strike led by Domitila Ch√∫ngara, requesting amnesty for exiled labour and political leaders. Espinal was killed by a right-wing paramilitary death squad in March 1980. He was kidnapped by the paramilitaries on 21 March and was tortured. His bounded and gagged body was only found by peasants the next day on the road to Chacaltaya. Some sources say Espinal was killed because he would publicize the cocaine traffic done by military personnel. Other say that the reason was that he informed against efforts to censor a public exhibition of Jorge Sanjin√©s's film El coraje del pueblo, a documentary that denounced the massacre of 67. Aside of being a priest and activist, Espinal was also a poet, journalist and filmmaker. He worked for a brief period in Spanish television until moving to Bolivia; he directed the social issues-themed Cuesti√≥n urgente (lit. \\"Urgent Issue\\"). In December 1967, he left the country in a protest against Francisco Franco's dictatorship censor on him and his program channel, TVE. In Bolivia, he directed a similar program, En carne viva (lit. \\"In living flesh\\"), a series of 20-minute documentaries for Televisi√≥n Boliviana (TVB). The show lasted from 1970 to 1971, when Espinal was sent off from TVB because he interviewed the √ëancahuaz√∫ Guerrilla. He was a film professor at the Higher University of San Andr√©s and the Universidad Cat√≥lica Boliviana, and worked for Radio Fides. Espinal was also a film critic for the newspapers Presencia, √öltima hora and Aqu√≠, a member of film company Ukamu, and wrote ten books about cinema. He gained Bolivian citizenship in 1970, and was one of the most informed critics of film, television and radio in the country. He was murdered in La Paz, in 1980, by a Bolivian-government death squad. Legacy Espinal's funeral on March 24 was reportedly attended by over 7,000 people in a manifestation against the regime. A posthumous book written by Espinal, Oraciones a quemarropa (lit. \\"Point-blank Prayers\\"), was published containing his poetic prose and prayers. In his homage, the Catalonia's Society of Jesus created the Luis Espinal Camps Foundation. For Espinal's contribution to cinema and human rights, Morales declared in 2007 the \\"Bolivian Cinema Day\\" to be commemorated on 21 March. In 1982, Bolivian historian Carlos Mesa published the book El cine boliviano seg√∫n Luis Espinal. Bolivian writer Alfonso Gumucio Dagron wrote a biography of Espinal in 1985. The 2007 documentary Lucho: Gastar la vida por los demais, directed by Nelson Mart√≠nez, explored the life of Espinal. In July 2015 Pope Francis visited the site where Espinal was killed. Espinal gained international notoriety as the author of a crucifix that incorporated the hammer and sickle after Bolivian president Evo Morales gave a replica of it to Pope Francis. The Pope said the Jesuit \\"preached the Gospel, the Gospel that bothered them, and because of this they got rid of him\\". Vatican representative Frederico Lombardi said that the object stands for open dialogue and his commitment to freedom. However, Espinal's friend, Xavier Alb√≥, said it symbolised that the Church should be in dialogue with Marxism, peasants and miners.

Only two daughters are mentioned in Genesis 19, while Lot and his family are in Sodom. Two angels arrive in Sodom, and Lot shows them hospitality. However, the men (and boys) of the city gather around Lot's house and demand that he give them the two guests so they could know them (verses ). In response, Lot offers the mob his two daughters instead, noting that they are virgins (verse ). The mob refuses Lot's offer, and the angels strike them with blindness, and then warn Lot to leave the city before it is destroyed. indicates that Lot has sons-in-law. The Hebrew text indicates that they are married to Lot's daughters, while NIV interprets the expression as \\"pledged to marry\\" his virgin daughters. Robert Alter suggests that verse (\\"your two daughters who remain with you\\") indicates that Lot's two virgin daughters left with him, but that he had other, married daughters who stayed behind with the sons-in-law. Lot's wife turns into a pillar of salt, but Lot and his daughters escape to Zoar, and end up living in a cave in the mountains. In Genesis Lot's daughters got their father drunk, and over two consecutive nights had sex with him without his knowledge. They both got pregnant. The older daughter gave birth to Moab, while the younger daughter gave birth to Ammon. Some say that Lot's daughters may have feared that they were the last humans on Earth and wanted to preserve the human race, however this perspective is illogical because they knew people lived in the nearby village of Zoar. Many scholars have drawn a connection between the episodes of Lot's daughters. According to Robert Alter this final episode \\"suggests measure-for-measure justice meted out for his rash offer.\\"Alter, Five Books of Moses, p. 92.

Jaishankar (1977 ‚Äì February 27, 2018), nicknamed Psycho Shankar, was an Indian criminal, sexual predator, and serial killer, notorious for a series of rapes and murders during 2008‚Äì2011. It is believed that he was involved in about 30 rape, murder, and robbery cases across Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. At the time of his death, he had been accused of murdering at least 19 women. Having been apprehended by Indian authorities, Jaishankar was imprisoned in Bangalore, where he was diagnosed as mentally ill. He subsequently committed suicide following an unsuccessful prison escape attempt in February 2018.  Early life  Jaishankar, a son of Maari Muthu, came from the Kanniyanpatti village of Salem district, Tamil Nadu. In May 2011, he was reported to be a married man with three daughters. He started his career as a truck driver. Criminal history Jaishankar started his criminal activities around 2008. His first crime to be reported happened on 3 July 2009, when he attempted to rape and murder 45-year-old P. Shyamala in Perandahalli. By August 2009, he had raped and murdered 12 women, and raped another six women. He always carried a black hand bag with him. He kept a machete in this bag, and killed whoever resisted him. He used to kidnap sex workers near dhabas (roadside restaurants) on highways, rape them and kill them brutally. He also targeted women in farm houses, in rural areas.  First arrest (2009)  On 23 August 2009, Jaishankar raped and murdered a 39-year-old police constable, M. Jayamani. Originally stationed at the Kangeyam all-women police station, Jayamani was on temporary duty at Perumanallur, during the visit of deputy chief minister M. K. Stalin. Jaishankar kidnapped her, and raped her several times before killing her. The police recovered Jayamani's body a month later, on 19 September. Jaishankar and his partner in crime P Mohan Selvam were charged with the murder of 50-year-old K. Thangammal Ponnaya in Namakkal on 10 September 2009. (Later, in 2014, the two were acquitted in this case, due to insufficient evidence resulting from lapses in investigation.) The Tiruppur police launched a manhunt for Jaishankar, and arrested him on 19 October 2009. He was jailed at the Coimbatore Central Prison. By this time, he had been charged with 13 separate counts of rape and murder in Tiruppur, Salem and Dharmapuri. He revealed, while remanded in custody, that he enjoyed torturing women before he raped and killed them. = First escape (2011) = On 17 March 2011, the police took Jaishankar to a fast-track court in Dharmapuri, for a murder case trial. The next day, armed reserve police constables M. Chinnasamy and Rajavelu were assigned to escort him back to Coimbatore. On the way, Jaishankar managed to escape at the Salem bus stand, around 9:30 p.m. On 19 March, Chinnasamy shot himself.  2011 murder spree in Ballary Jaishankar escaped to Karnataka, where he raped and murdered six women in Bellary over the next month. He also killed a man and a child in Dharmapuri. In the last week of April 2011, the police traced his mobile phone to Delhi. The police initially believed that he had discarded his mobile phone in Delhi. However, in May 2011, the police traced his mobile calls to Mumbai, but he stopped using his mobile phone. A special team, comprising two sub-inspectors and 15 other police personnel, was assigned to find and arrest him.  Second arrest (2011)  By May 2011, the police had put up wanted posters seeking information about Jaishankar, in public places across Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. On the night of 4 May 2011, Jaishankar reached Elagi village in Karnataka, on a stolen motorcycle. He approached a woman, Chandrakala Hotagi, who was working alone in a field, and asked her for water and food. He then tried to rape her, but Chandrakala raised the alarm. Her husband, Prakash Hotagi, and a friend came to her rescue. Jaishankar tried to flee, but was caught by Prakash and other villagers. The locals brought him to the Zalaki police station. He was handed over to the Chitradurga police on 5 May 2011. = Second escape (2013) = After his 2011 arrest, Jaishankar was kept at the Parappana Agrahara Central Jail in Bangalore. He was sentenced to 27 years in prison. At the Bangalore jail, he underwent treatment for psychiatric problems. On 31 August 2013, the police took Jaishankar to the court in Tumkur near Bangalore. After returning, Jaishankar feigned uneasiness and was admitted to the hospital within the prison premises. He managed to secure a duplicate key and used it at 2 a.m. on 1 September 2013, when the daily change of guards took place. The police suspected that an insider helped him get the duplicate key. He scaled a 20-foot (6.1 m) wall, then walked atop a 15-foot (4.6 m) wall and finally scaled the 30-foot (9.1 m) high compound wall. He managed to cross the electric fence safely, since it was not functional that night. He reportedly carried with him a bamboo pole balancing on the walls and a bedsheet to serve as a cushion over the glass pieces on the wall top. He was injured during the escape, and drops of blood were found outside the outer wall. He was reportedly wearing a police uniform during his escape. 11 jail staff, including three wardens, two jailors and six security guards, were suspended following his escape to reprimand them for allowing the escape. The police issued a red alert to all police stations in Karnataka, and urged women to be careful in isolated places. They announced a reward of 500,000 for any information leading to his arrest. They also analyzed his psychology and life history to predict his next actions. Besides this, the police printed 10,000 wanted posters and 75,000 pamphlets with different photographic profiles of Jaishankar, in five languages ‚Äî Hindi, Kannada, Marathi, Tamil, and Telugu. Besides Karnataka, these posters and pamphlets were distributed across Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Maharashtra.  Third arrest (2013)  During his escape, Jaishankar had fractured his leg while jumping from the 30-foot (9.1 m) high wall of the prison compound. He did not contact his family in Tamil Nadu. Soon after his escape, a police informant managed to get in touch with him. The informant lured him to a dilapidated building near the Kudlu gate in Bangalore, with the promise of a motorbike to facilitate his escape outside the city. There, the police arrested Jaishankar, at noon on 6 September 2013. The Government spent over 75,000 treating his fractured leg at the Victoria Hospital, where he was operated on, on 23 September. The surgery on his leg having been completed, Jaishankar was sent to Central Prison, Bangalore to begin serving his sentence. He was kept in a high- security cell, with 24/7 CCTV monitoring and extra lights. The lock of his cell was designed to be out of his reach. It was decided that in case of an illness, he would be treated inside his cell, instead of being taken to a hospital. The police also decided to deploy extra security while escorting him to trials to minimize the likelihood of an escape.  Death  On 25 February 2018, Jaishankar unsuccessfully tried to effect another escape from the Bangalore Central Prison. After this plot failed, he was held in solitary confinement. Subsequently, on 27 February, he committed suicide by slitting his own throat with a shaving blade, which he had acquired from a barber the day before. The jail staff found him lying in a pool of blood at around 2:30 a.m., during their daily rounds, and provided him first aid. He was later moved to Victoria Hospital, where he was declared dead at 5:10 a.m.  References  1977 births 2018 deaths Indian serial killers Male serial killers Indian escapees Escapees from Indian detention People from Salem district Crime in Tamil Nadu Crime in Karnataka Indian people convicted of murder People convicted of murder by India Indian prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment Prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment by India Indian rapists 21st- century criminals Criminals from Tamil Nadu Serial killers who committed suicide in prison custody ","title":"M.

Appointed Chief Judge on July 14, 2000 at age 43, she was the second youngest chief judge in BC history and the first female chief of the BC Provincial Court. Baird Ellan currently lives on the Sunshine Coast of BC with her husband Tim, with whom she practiced law and family mediation under the firm name Ellan Community Law. They both also volunteer with and have served as the Northwest Region representatives for Retrouvaille International, a marriage support charity. They have five adult children who live in the Vancouver areahttp://www.nsnews.com/news/case-closed-1.36720} In February 2015, Baird Ellan received the nomination of the New Democratic Party of Canada in the federal riding of Burnaby North‚ÄîSeymour in the 2015 federal election. The riding was created by the federal redistricting of 2012, and comprises a section of North Vancouver east of Lynn Creek North Vancouver and the section of Burnaby north of the Lougheed Highway Burnaby‚ÄîDouglas. Background Baird Ellan was born Carol Cecilia Baird in Vancouver in 1956, but at a young age moved with her family to Oa'hu, Hawaii, where she attended Kailua High School. The family returned to Vancouver in 1972, where Baird Ellan completed her high school education at Point Grey Secondary School in 1973 at the age of 16, and enrolled in the University of British Columbia. An avid guitarist from a young age, Baird Ellan initially pursued a degree in music, but soon transferred to the Faculty of Commerce, having resolved to attend law school after a memorable high school law course. She was accepted at UBC Law School in 1976, after her third year of undergraduate studies, and graduated 7th in her class in 1979, at 22. After her call to the bar in 1980, she joined Thornsteinssons, a tax law firm in Vancouver. In 1983, Baird Ellan followed her husband Tim into a career as a Crown prosecutor, maintaining a focus in criminal law until 1993, when she was appointed as a judge. After a short period presiding in small claims court, she was relocated to Vancouver's Main Street criminal court, in the city's notorious Downtown Eastside, western Canada's largest criminal court. She served as Administrative Judge there from 1985 until her appointment as Associate Chief Judge in 1999 and then Chief Judge of the BC Provincial Court in 2000. She completed a five-year term as Chief Judge, and returned to preside in North Vancouver Provincial Court from 2005 until her retirement in 2012.http://www.provincialcourt.bc.ca/about-the- court/judicial-officers/chief-judge Baird Ellan has an identical twin, Kathryn, who resides in West Vancouver. Her father, Thomas Baird, a retired advertising executive, resides in Vancouver while her mother, Nancy Baird, a retired executive word processor, lives on the Sunshine Coast. She also has a brother, Andrew, who resides on Vancouver Island. Legal career Baird Ellan financed her college and law school education teaching guitar lessons, working as a bank teller, and taking part-time law clerk positions doing research and annotating case books for the BC Supreme Court. After graduation and a brief vacation in Europe, she commenced articles with a maritime law firm but transferred mid-year to a larger firm, Ladner Downs [now Borden Ladner Gervais], shortly before the maritime firm dissolved. Having sought a litigation position, she was placed in the corporate section and soon followed a law school friend to pursue a tax litigation career at Thorsteinssons, where she practiced for 2¬Ω years. In 1983, she moved to the Vancouver Prosecutor's Office, where she appeared in all levels of criminal court, culminating in an assignment to the Criminal Appeals and Special Prosecutions section, and one memorable appearance in the Supreme Court of Canada. During those years, Baird Ellan had her five children, in 1984, 1986, 1987, 1990 and 1992. She appeared before the Supreme Court of Canada in the case of R. v. V.T., [1992] 1 S.C.R. 749, on January 29, 1992. The case involved a minor assault by a young offender on a group home staff member, and engaged the issue of whether a judge could dismiss a charge based on his assessment of the case as too minor to justify a conviction. Acting for the Crown, Baird Ellan sought to uphold the ultimate discretion of the Crown to determine whether a charge should proceed. Having lost in the BC Court of Appeal, she sought leave to appeal. Though seldom granted by the Supreme Court for Crown appeals, the Court decided that the case engaged important legal principles, and assigned the full bench of nine judges to hear the appeal. Baird Ellan appeared alone to argue the case while 7 months pregnant with her fifth child, and was successful in achieving an unprecedented unanimous reversal of the Court of Appeal's decision. A year after the delivery of her fifth child, Baird Ellan was appointed to the Provincial Court by NDP Attorney General Colin Gabelmann, at age 36, as part of a small claims backlog reduction initiative, along with her longtime friend and colleague, Ellen Burdett, and the late Chief Judge Hugh Stansfield. 2002 Courthouse Closures In January 2002, Gordon Campbell's BC Liberal government announced plans to permanently close 24 provincial courthouses to achieve cost savings. In response, Chief Judge Baird Ellan issued a press release protesting the closures, and wrote privately to then-attorney general Geoff Plant, arguing that the government had made an \\"unlawful\\" decision to plan these closures without the consultation of the judiciary, and asserting that Plant had \\"lost the confidence\\" of the judiciary. Baird Ellan suggested that these closures were a potential Charter violation of communities' access to justice rights, as a number of the courthouses planned for closure were already operating at 100% capacity, and many serviced communities that had no nearby alternative. Under Baird Ellan's direction, the Provincial Court Judiciary prepared an assessment of the impact of the courthouse closures.http://www.provincialcourt.bc.ca/downloads/pdf/preliminaryassessmentofproposedcourthouseclosuresfeb18.pdf The judiciary's resistance to the closures triggered a major public dispute, and the launch of a constitutional challenge of the government decision by the Law Society of British Columbia. The legal proceedings resulted in publication of the \\"confidential\\" letter and further heated public debate about the proper role of the judiciary in speaking out and leading such challenges to government decisions.https://www.lawsociety.bc.ca/page.cfm?cid=1809&t;=Chief- Judge-and-Attorney-General-discuss-courthouse-closures In May 2002 a memorandum of understanding was signed between the judiciary and the Attorney General's office, which delayed the closure of some courts and provided for temporary circuit courts as caseloads transitioned to the remaining courthouses. The Law Society action was discontinued.url=https://www.lawsociety.bc.ca/page.cfm?cid=2066&t;=Law- Society-of-B.C.-adjourns-court-challenge} By the end of 2002, courthouse service in over a dozen cities in British Columbia was ended permanently, but many of the originally proposed closures were maintained as circuit courts. Further challenges as Chief Judge In 2002, Baird Ellan was advised of the possibility of a criminal investigation into a judge presiding in Prince George. She took immediate steps to have the judge removed from his sitting duties and placed under a conduct investigation, following which several young female complainants came forward with allegations of sexual abuse at the hands of the judge. Judge David Ramsay was ultimately convicted of several counts of sexual assault in 2004, and sentenced to seven years' imprisonment. He died in prison, in 2008. After the end of her term as Chief Judge, Baird Ellan declined to pursue the customary elevation to Supreme Court and elected to resume sitting as a judge in her community of North Vancouver. During her seven years presiding there, she published more than 300 decisions in the criminal, small claims and family spheres. These, as well as her decisions prior to 2005, may be viewed on www.canlii.org. In 2012, Baird Ellan retired from the Provincial Court bench and resumed practice as a lawyer, concentrating in family law and family mediation. She worked primarily for low income clients at nominal rates, or pro bono, assisting clients who were unable to afford the customary legal fees [of $200 ‚Äì 400 per hour] charged by experienced family lawyers. Political career In February 2015, Baird Ellan won the NDP nomination for Burnaby-North Seymour. While seeking to earn the nomination, Baird Ellan was endorsed by then Burnaby mayor, Derek Corrigan. Baird Ellan has stated that she opposes the Kinder Morgan Pipeline expansion, like then Burnaby-Douglas MP, Kennedy Stewart, now Mayor of Vancouver. She lost to Liberal candidate Terry Beech.

History Palazzo Caprini Raphael purchased Palazzo Caprini in 1517, spending the last 3 years of his life there Towards the middle of the 15th century, a house named \\"della stufa\\" stood at the northwest edge of the little Piazza Scossacavalli in Borgo.Gigli (1992) p. 44 A stufa (from the German word stube) was something between a Roman bath and a modern sauna, often attended by artists who could freely sketch nudes there. In 1500 the house was sold to the apostolic protonotary Adriano (or Alessandro) de Caprineis, of the noble Caprini family of Viterbo.Cambedda (1990) p. 55 During those years, Pope Alexander VI Borgia (r. 1492‚Äì1503 ) was pursuing a project to open a new road between Castel Sant'Angelo and the Old St. Peter's Basilica. This road was named Via Alessandrina after the pope and later Borgo Nuovo, and was officially inaugurated in 1500. People willing to erect buildings at least 5 canne ( ca.) high along the new road received special privileges, such as tax exemptions. The Caprini fulfilled this obligation by buying a portion of another house near the stufa and erecting there a small palazzo designed by Donato Bramante. It was unfinished on 7 October 1517, when the Caprini sold it for 3,000 ducati to Raphael.Gigli (1992) p. 46 The artist completed the construction, spending there the last three years of his life. He painted in those rooms the Transfiguration, and died there on 6 April 1520.Borgatti (1926) p. 163 After Raphael's death, the building was sold to the Cardinal of Ancona, Pietro Accolti, who already owned another palazzo on via Alessandrina, separated from the building through a house which the Cardinal bought later. After the death of the Cardinal, the palace was inherited by his nephew Benedetto, Cardinal of Ravenna. Accused of corruption, the Cardinal was imprisoned in Castel Sant'Angelo in 1534 and released after paying a fine of 59,000 scudi to the Apostolic Chamber.Gigli (1992) p. 48 The cardinal had to borrow the huge sum from the Florentine bankers Giulio and Lorenzo Strozzi, who later acquired his palace for 6,000 scudi as partial reimbursement of the loan. However, the Cardinal reserved the right to redeem the building after repaying his creditors, and this led to a lawsuit between his heirs and the heirs of the Strozzi. The latter won, but in 1576 they were forced to sell the building, which was crumbling and whose walls had been shored up, to Cardinal Giovanni Francesco Commendone.Dal Mas & Spagnesi (2010) Palazzo dei Convertendi Cardinal Giovanni Francesco Commendone ordered the transformation of the building into its definitive form Commendone had the palace restored by Annibale Lippi, who had assessed it before the purchase. Lippi possibly gave the facade its definitive shape. The palace was then sold after 1584 to Camilla Peretti, the sister of Pope Sixtus V (r. 1585‚Äì90), who bought it on behalf of her brother for her grandnephew, Cardinal Alessandro Peretti di Montalto.Gigli (1992) p. 50 Camilla Peretti bought also some houses facing Piazza Scossacavalli and Borgo Vecchio, so that the palace reached its full extension. According to others, after the death of Commendone, the palace was sold to Cardinal Giovanni Antonio Facchinetti, the future Pope Innocentius IX (r. 1591), whose heirs then sold it in 1614 to the Apostolic Chamber. Around 1620, the palace was purchased by members of the House of Spinola, a noble Genoese family, who sold it in 1676 to another Genoese patrician, Cardinal Girolamo Gastaldi (1616‚Äì85). Gastaldi, who died in his palace on 8 April 1685, willed the edifice to the Hospice of the Convertendi, which moved there in 1715.Borgatti (1926) p. 164 This institution, founded in 1600 by Pope Clement VIII (r. 1592‚Äì1605), was devoted to the protection of the Protestants who wanted to convert to the Catholic faith. The palace was directly under the authority of the Pope, and was administered by elected members of the institute superintended by the Maggiordomo pro tempore of the Apostolic Palace.Gigli (1992) p. 52 The edifice was badly damaged during the flood of 1805, including the collapse of a vault in the basement, and restored by Pope Gregory XVI (r. 1831‚Äì46). Under the reign of Pope Pius IX (r. 1846-78) it housed the Collegio Ecclesiastico from 1852-54.http://archive.thetablet.co.uk/article/7th-september-1918/11/the-beda- college This was a seminary especially for English convert clergy that eventually became the Beda College. The palace underwent further restoration in 1876,Cambedda (1990) p. 57 and Pope Benedict XV (r. 1914‚Äì22) had the monumental staircase built. Palazzo della Congregazione per le Chiese orientali The palace (centre), photographed during its demolition in 1937, is dominated by the massive dome of St. Peter's behind it Pope Benedict in 1917 assigned the building to the newly founded Congregation for the Oriental Churches. In 1929, within the framework of the Lateran Treaties, the palace enjoyed the privileges of extraterritoriality. In 1937, during the construction of the Via della Conciliazione, the palace was demolished, and then reconstructed until 1941 west of Palazzo Torlonia. The relocation was supervised by Giuseppe Momo, the \\"court architect\\" of Pius XI (r. 1922‚Äì39), who after 1929 reshaped the new Vatican City. Momo collaborated in the reconstruction with Marcello Piacentini and Attilio Spaccarelli (the designers of via della Conciliazione). The architects moved the palace to an area that, until the mid-19th century, had been occupied by the houses of Soderini, an early Renaissance complex. The accuracy of the reconstruction allows the consideration of the rebuilt Palazzo dei Convertendi not as a new building, but as another phase in the centuries-old life of the edifice. From 1939, when the reconstruction was still incomplete, the palace was home to the Magistero di Maria SS. Assunta school. In 1946, the school moved to new premises, also along Via della Conciliazione.Gigli (1990), p. 90 Since that date, the palace has housed several offices of the Holy See and the apartments of high-ranking prelates. Description Palazzo Caprini Palazzo Caprini's facade along Borgo Nuovo in a 1549 etching by Antoine Lafr√©ry from Speculum Romanae Magnificentiae Detail of the facade. Photo by Paolo Monti, 1979 The original building is known only through etchings and drawings by contemporaries. These include an etching by Antoine Lafr√©ry in 1549; drawings by Jean de Cheveni√©res and Andrea Palladio (1541 ca.), Domenico Alfani (Christmas 1581), and Ottavio Mascherino; and a fresco in the Logge of Gregory XIII in the Vatican by Antonio Tempesta and Matthijs Bril, representing the translation in St. Peter of the corpse of Saint Gregory of Nazianzus.Gigli (1992) p. 54 In addition, a detailed survey of the palace executed just before its demolition in 1937 was discovered, yielding precious information about its different construction phases. According to the drawing of Lafr√©ry, the originary edifice had three windows on Piazza Scossacavalli and five on Borgo Nuovo. According to the survey of the 1930s, the main front faced Borgo Nuovo, with three windows along Piazza Scossacavalli and two along the former road. In this case, the drawing of Lafr√©ry could be considered an idealisation of the building, which would be not an isolated case in his works. The building had two main floors. The lower one was rusticated, with ashlar obtained through a process called \\"di getto\\", which involved mixing pozzolana, lime, and other materials in a formwork. The portal and the doors of the shops, surmounted arches which contained the small windows of a mezzanine, were placed in the rustication. The lower floor constituted the podium of the upper floor, which adopted the Doric order. This was marked by columns surmounted by an entablature, with architrave and frieze decorated with triglyphs and metopes. Parapets were inserted in the spans of the upper floor. The building was concluded by a service attic whose windows opened in the Doric frieze of the entablature. This rustication technique was quickly adopted in Rome, and the building, which had been inspired by Roman architecture, was soon imitated (for example, at Palazzo Massimo alle Colonne, erected in 1532 by Baldassare Peruzzi). However, the palace was soon subject to decay.Gigli (1992) p. 56 In a 1581 drawing, the rustication coating at the ground floor had disappeared, and after 1585, the two facades assumed a pronounced manierist look. Palazzo dei Convertendi Facade of Palazzo dei Convertendi along Piazza Scossacavalli, 1920 ca. Since that time, the palace occupied the whole west side of Piazza Scossacavalli, with six shops and two portals at its center. The left portal introduced into the small church of San Filippo Neri, erected in the 17th century by the Spinola and containing only one altar. The ground floor was surmounted by three floors, each with eight windows; those belonging to the piano nobile had centred and rusticated frames. The facade on Borgo Nuovo had a ground floor with five shops, interrupted by a rusticated portal surmounted by a palladian window. Above it was a balcony, attributed to Carlo Fontana or Baldassarre Peruzzi, also rusticated and surmounted by a palladian window. This balcony was considered by the Romans as the most elegant in the city. The upper floors had fifteen rectangular windows. The manieristic style of the exterior originated from the centred windows framed by alternatively long and short ashlars, the white plastered walls contrasting with the rusticated portals, and the balcony along Borgo Nuovo, also rusticated. At the end of the 19th century, spurs of a geometric white and black sgraffito decoration were discovered on the facade, and a living room with a coffer ceiling at the northeast edge of the first floor was identified as the room in which Raphael painted his last works, including the Transfiguration. At that time, a marble inscription commemorating the artist's ownership of the palace and his death there was affixed to the facade. Reconstructed palace The reconstructed Palazzo between Palazzo Torlonia to the right and Palazzo Rusticucci-Accoramboni‚Äìalso rebuilt‚Äìto the left The building that exists today along Via della Conciliazione has two floors with a rusticated portal surmounted by Peruzzi's balcony.Gigli (1992) p. 58 The building receives light from square windows at the ground floor, centred and rusticated windows on the piano nobile, and rectangular windows at the second floor. The roof is topped by a projecting cornice. The elements of the windows, of the portal, and of the balcony were dismounted from the original edifice and reused here. In the building's porch, the aforementioned inscription is embedded in the wall, as well as a coat of arms of Alexander VI and another Latin inscription which reads: The building has a yard with arches resting on rusticated Doric pillars sustaining spherical vaults. On the first floor is a display of 120 Russian paintings on religious subjects, almost all produced by Russian painter Leonida Brailowsky (1872‚Äì1937). The new palace also contains several frescoes from the original building in Piazza Scossacavalli, among them a group of lunettes attributed to the school of Pomarancio, five landscape paintings in the so-called Popes (or Patriarchs) reception room on the first floor, and two battle scenes in the Audience room.Gigli (1992) p. 60 References Sources  See also *Properties of the Holy See External links Convertendi Convertendi Renaissance architecture in Rome Buildings and structures demolished in 1937 ","title":"Palazzo dei Convertendi"},{"id":"47200756","text":"Brian Ross (born 15 August 1967) is a Scottish football player and manager.

The following is a list of vaping bans in the United States. For federal regulation concerning the legal status of the sale of electronic cigarettes products in and outside the United States, see the worldwide regulation of electronic cigarettes. General regulation Federal alt=A no smoking or vaping sign from the US. Effective August 8, 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) mandates electronic cigarettes products to be regulated as tobacco products. The FDA rule also bans sales to minors. The FDA classified e-cigarettes as drug delivery devices and subject to regulation under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) before importation and sale in the US. Following an outbreak of lung illness linked to vaping products that sickened hundreds of people and left six people dead in the US, the Donald Trump administration in September 2019 was working on plans to ban e-cigarette liquid flavors. State Some state and regional governments have extended existing indoor smoking bans to include e-cigarettes. , 12 US states and 615 localities had prohibited the use of e-cigarettes in venues in which traditional cigarette smoking was prohibited. High schools and some middle schools throughout the US have been revising their tobacco rules to ban vaping on school grounds. 13 states, 2 territories, and 841 municipalities have outlawed vaping in smoke-free public areas, as of April 2019. A review of regulations in 40 US states found that how a law defines tobacco products may allow e-cigarettes to avoid smoke-free laws, taxation, and restrictions on sales and marketing. The tobacco industry heavily lobbies states to make it harder to regulate and tax e-cigarettes. Indoor bans thumb400pxIndoor vaping laws by-state in the US. alt=The sign states: No smoking and vaping within 9 meters of building. In August 2016, a World Health Organization (WHO) report recommended that e-cigarettes be banned in indoor areas or where smoking is prohibited. This is because of their potential for non-users to be exposed to chemicals and e-cigarette aerosol in indoor areas. Many local and state jurisdictions have recently begun enacting laws that prohibit e-cigarette usage everywhere that smoking is banned, although some state laws with comprehensive smoke-free laws will still allow for vaping to be permitted in bars and restaurants while prohibiting e-cigarettes in other indoor places. The only states that do not regulate indoor vaping at all, be it by state territory or on a local level, are in the states of Nebraska, Nevada, Rhode Island, and Tennessee.

On 8 October 1935, Wallace was shot in the chest by one of the fugitives in the incident on the outskirts of Banff, Alberta, succumbing to his wounds later that day. He had previously earned a distinguished service record in the British Army during World War I. He emigrated to Canada and joined the Alberta Provincial Police after the war in 1921, before it was amalgamated with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police by 1932 and had been a law enforcement officer in Alberta for 14 years before his death. Early life and World War I Wallace was born in Banffshire, Scotland and enlisted in the British Army prior to the First World War. Assigned to the 1/6 Battalion, Gordon Highlanders, he saw action in the initial campaigns of the war including the Battle of Mons as an \\"old contemptible\\" of the British Expeditionary Force. He was awarded a Military Medal for his distinguished service as a sniper and left the army as a Serjeant. Police career After the First World War, Thomas emigrated to Canada and joined the Alberta Provincial Police in 1921. The force itself was relatively new after having been formed in 1917 to replace the paramilitary Northwest Mounted Police which had just relinquished policing duties in Alberta. He was posted across Alberta throughout his career with the APP was noted as an effective policeman winning the Byron Trophy for being the best shot with a revolver in the entire force. The force was amalgamated with the RCMP in 1932 as a cost-cutting measure during the Great Depression. At the time of the amalgamation, Wallace was an APP Sergeant serving as a drill instructor stationed in Lethbridge. He was allowed retained his rank in the newly formed Alberta detachment of the RCMP after additional training in Regina. Death and funeral On 7 October 1935, Wallace had been dispatched with fellow British born RCMP officer Constable George \\"Scotty\\" Harrison while in dressed in plain clothed. They were to assist with the capture of three fugitive Doukhobors identified as John Kalmakoff, Joseph Posnikoff, and Peter Woiken. They had been suspected of killing Constable William Wainwright of the Benito police force and RCMP Constable John Shaw. They joined with uniformed RCMP officers G.E Combes and Gray Campbell in an unmarked police vehicle. On 8 October, the perpetrators had robbed a vehicle driven by C.T Scott. Scott had his money and wristwatch stolen by the disoriented fugitives. They bizarrely informed him that they would return his wristwatch if he did not inform the police and continued to follow his vehicle westward as it drove towards Banff. As the two vehicles arrived in Banff, Scott stopped his vehicle before an RCMP checkpoint near the eastern gate of Banff National Park and informed the uniformed Campbell that the men in the vehicle following him had just robbed him. As Wallace and Harrison approached the vehicle, two shots through the windshield were fired by its occupants, hitting both officers. The officers continued to engage the fugitives but had been mortally wounded. Harrison had been shot in the neck, and managed to shoot out the headlights of the vehicle before losing consciousness. Wallace fired his service revolver until he was low on ammunition and collapsed from his wounds. Combes was able to shoot Woiken, killing him instantly while the remaining two perpetrators were tracked down by a combined force of RCMP officers and enraged civilians. Kalmakoff and Posnikoff were both and ultimately shot and morally wounded by civilian William Neish./ Wallace was transported to Calgary for medical attention after the shooting where he died of his wounds, with his wife Helen at his side. His partner Harrison also died of his wounds on the same day. At the time of his death, Wallace had been a police officer for 14 years in Alberta. His long years of service were recognized in his massive funeral procession led by the Calgary Highlanders' Pipes and Drums band. He was buried with full masonic and military honours at Calgary's Union Cemetery.

Miniassegni were used as replacement for change which had become very scarce. Before miniassegni appeared, widely used replacement for coins had been telephone tokens, candy or other small merchandise items, and - in some cities - public transport tickets. History Miniassegno issued by Banca del Salento, 1977 The first miniassegni were issued on December 10, 1975 by Istituto Bancario San Paolo, with a face value of 100 Italian lire, (about 0.14 US dollars at 1983 exchange rates). Many banks soon followed by issuing miniassegni with face values of 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300 and 350 lire. Their name (mini-checks) indicated that they were cashier's checks (assegni in Italian), but smaller than normal. To overcome the prohibition to issue currency (exclusive prerogative of the Bank of Italy), banks were printing actual bank drafts, made payable to various small entities and companies with their pre-printed endorsement. The checks were then treated as bearer securities, and exchanged by the public as if they were real currency. At their peak, there existed 835 different types of miniassegni, issued by 42 banks, for a total estimated value of more than 200 billion lire. Some banks issued \\"illustrated\\" series with distinctive designs. These issues, printed in limited quantities, were sold to collectors at a substantial markup. At some point, even department stores chimed in, printing goods-redeemable gift certificates in small denominations. Printing miniassegni was widely believed to be a boon for the issuers, which sold them to retailers, pressured by the dearth of small denomination coins. However, many checks were never returned, either because they were destroyed by wear (which was substantial, due to the poor quality of the paper) or because they disappeared from circulation hoarded by collectors, or forgotten by their holders, which did not much care, due to their diminutive value. The miniassegni disappeared at the end of 1978 when the Government Printing Office and Mint was finally able to overcome the lack of small change. The reason for the scarcity of coins was never clear, though various, mostly false, explanations were being given (e.g. that the value of the coins was substantially lower than that of the metal they contained; that Italian coins were being used as watch faces by Swiss watchmakers). Hans Magnus Enzensberger, in an essay written a few years after the fact, lists several explanations given at the time and traces one of the probable causes to a temporary technical inadequacy of the Italian Mint, caused by bureaucratic complications.Hans Magnus Enzensberger: Italienische Ausschweifungen.

You can read various content, such as celebrity's social media, Contents, e-commerce deals, and more, all in your native language. Flitto provides human-powered translations. Machine translation has its limits as it cannot reflect cultural backgrounds or other specific situation in a given context. Flitto, on the other hand, offers a full human-powered translation service which overcomes these issues. Flitto's goal is to break down all the language barriers. The service supports text, image, and voice translations, and 1:1 translation in 19 different languages (Arabic, Chinese (simplified), Chinese (traditional), English, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Hindi, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Tagalog, Thai, Turkish, Vietnamese) and the most recently added one is Finnish. Flitto‚Äôs current user estimate is 5+ million and is being used in 170 countries, with about 300K translations submitted daily.  History  Flitto was incorporated in September 1, 2012 by founder Simon Lee along with co-founders Dan Kang and Jin Kim.

Since its inception, Flitto has been working with other global companies such as Microsoft, JYP, Google, and Naver.  Crowd-sourcing Translation   Point  Points are required to request crowd-sourcing translation. Points can either be purchased through credit card or by mobile phone (Korea only), PayPal, AliPay, or earned by submitting translations and having them selected.  Text  Users can request texts in 18 different languages (Arabic, Chinese (simplified), Chinese (traditional), English, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Hindi, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Tagalog, Thai, Turkish, Vietnamese) by using points. Although Flitto shows the recommended points for each request, the user can manually change it. The requests will be pushed to different users who are capable of translating in the requested language, allowing them to translate for points. Depending on the length of the text, the user can manually divide the text into short sections so that the request can be sent to different translator-users; which can shorten the lead time since sections can be translated at the same time by different translators. In order to keep consistency for translated text, requestors can leave a memo for the translators. The translators are able to read the full text, as well as translations other users have made on other parts of the text.  Image/GPS  In situations where users feel difficult to cumbersome to make requests in form of text, they always have the option to make translation requests by simply taking a picture of the subject and posting it on Flitto. Also, using the GPS function, users can see image translations that have been done previously by other users within nearby area upon requesting image translations.  Voice  Users can also record voices/sounds and make translation requests on Flitto when they are not able to understand that particular language.  1:1 Translation  Flitto links experienced translators from various fields such as literature, science and tech with people/companies seeking high quality translation through 1:1 translation service. 1:1 translation service allows users to directly select and make requests to translators that match his/her conditions (price, specialty, deadline).

Hiordt sent a description of the tree to the renowned botanist Carl Linnaeus in the Swedish university city of Uppsala. Cuttings were taken from the original tree, from which all Orn√§s birch trees have been propagated. The tree fell in a storm on May 26, 1890. Two new trees were planted in its place, taken from cuttings of the original tree. At a later time a third one was added. The location of the trees is 60¬∞31'15.0\\"N 15¬∞32'35.5\\"E In 1985, the Orn√§s birch was named as the national tree of Sweden, and examples have been planted in central locations in many Swedish towns. In that same year, the first eight Betula pendula 'dalecarlica's were imported to Pretoria, South Africa, from a nursery in Germany, by an avid tree lover, Karl Ernst Haese. Description Orn√§s birch trees grow to a height of 20‚Äì25 metres, and have a rounded, somewhat uneven crown. The main branches have an acute angle to the trunk, and only the outermost branches are hanging. The Orn√§s birch is often confused with the similar birches Betula pendula 'Crispa' and Betula pendula 'Laciniata', and all three varieties are sometimes sold commercially as \\"Swedish birch\\". The genuine Orn√§s birch can be distinguished by its growth-form, and in that its leaves are more deeply indented than the other varieties. Male and female flowers are present, and the Orn√§s birch can be propagated from seed, cuttings, or grafting onto normal Betula pendula rootstock.

Life and career German Sterligov was born in Zagorsk (today Sergiyev Posad), Russian SFSR, Soviet Union. He attended college but eventually dropped out. In 1990, during the dissolution period of the USSR, he was instrumental in the founding of the Russian commodities exchange. The exchange is named after his dog, Alisa. After starting a successful company at the age of 24, Sterligov became Russia's first official millionaire. His company employed more than 2,500 people and had offices in New York City and London. Thereafter, his wealth amounted to more than one billion dollars. In 1996, Sterligov became more devout in his Russian Orthodox faith, but not without rebuttal of his misogyny by orthodox scholars. He is a nationalist and has participated in several political campaigns. He ran unsuccessfully for governor of the Krasnoyarsk region in Siberia, and mayor of Moscow. In 2004, Sterligov ran for the presidency of Russia, but his candidacy was prevented by the federal government. During the Financial crisis of 2007‚Äì08, Sterligov founded the Anti-Crisis Settlement and Accounting Center, which gave financial support to those exchanging goods and services. He also founded a housing commune for farmers and artisans while providing free social and medical services. A staunch anti-abortionist, Sterligov launched a media campaign against abortion throughout Russia in 2010. In December 2010, Sterligov sent an open letter to Vladimir Putin and Dimitry Medvedev, proposing a suggestion to sell Siberia and the Russian Far East to other countries after transferring ethnic Russians to European Russia.–û—Ç–∫—Ä—ã—Ç–æ–µ –ø–∏—Å—å–º–æ –ü—Ä–µ–∑–∏–¥–µ–Ω—Ç—É –ú–µ–¥–≤–µ–¥–µ–≤—É –∏ –ü—Ä–µ–º—å–µ—Ä-–º–∏–Ω–∏—Å—Ç—Ä—É –ü—É—Ç–∏–Ω—É –æ—Ç –æ–≤—Ü–µ–≤–æ–¥–∞ –°—Ç–µ—Ä–ª–∏–≥–æ–≤–∞ After his unsuccessful attempt to be a presidential candidate, Sterligov sold most of his assets to live in a forest. He was noted for living in a cottage with his family. He told the BBC that he wished to escape \\"the mercenary atmosphere, the envy and the hustle\\" of Moscow. The cottage did not have electricity and was accessible only by horse carriage. In 2015, Sterligov announced moving to the unrecognised Nagorno-Karabakh Republic with his wife and five children. It was reported that he sold most of his assets in Russia prior to moving to Nagorno-Karabakh. After settling in Nagorno-Karabakh, Sterligov announced plans to start a farming business and stated that his wife would open a designer store. The move caused anger in Azerbaijan whose internationally recognised borders Nagorno-Karabakh lies within. Later Sterligov openly called for the international recognition of the unrecognised state. The Office of the Prosecutor General of Azerbaijan brought an action against Sterligov for making statements against Azerbaijani statehood and for crossing the Azerbaijani border illegally.

Rabbi Avraham Al-Naddaf with his three sons, circa 1920 Early life and upbringing Born in Qaryat al-Qabil,A town situated four- hours' walking distance from Sana'a. Yemen, in 1866, he began to study the Hebrew alphabet at the age of three, followed by Torah and the Aramaic Targum of Onkelos at the age of seven in the Beth midrash of Rabbi Yosef Ha-Cohen in Sana'a, where his parents had relocated. When he had but reached the age of ten, there was added to his curriculum the Judeo-Arabic translation of the Pentateuch composed by Rabbi Saadia Gaon, the Mishnah with the commentary of Rabbi Obadiah da Bertinoro, and the Shulchan Arukh.Shelomo Al-Naddaf, Zekhor Le‚ÄôAvraham (ed. Uzziel Alnaddaf), Jerusalem 1992, p. 9 (Hebrew). The following year he was transferred by his father to the Beth midrash of Rabbi Avraham al- Qareh (d. 1890), where he began to learn the proper rendering for readings in the Babylonian Talmud, as this teacher is said to have been the most punctilious and astute of his generation. At the age of fourteen, he continued his studies in the Talmud and in the legal writings of the poskim (exponents of Jewish law),Shelomo Al-Naddaf, Zekhor Le‚ÄôAvraham (ed. Uzziel Alnaddaf), Jerusalem 1992, pp. 10 ‚Äì 11 (Hebrew). and eventually studied more advanced rabbinic Judaism under the great teacher Rabbi Hayyim b. Yosef Qorah (d. 1914). In 1886, at the age of twenty, Avraham married his first wife who bore him a daughter, but they would both become ill and die during the sea-voyage from Yemen to Egypt in 1891, while en route to Palestine. His one-and-a-half year old daughter was buried at sea, while his wife died in Port Said. Dazed and bereft of his wife and only child, Avraham arrived in Jaffa in the Spring of that year, and from there he traveled with a party, some by cart, others by mules and camels, unto Jerusalem.Shelomo Al-Naddaf, Zekhor Le‚ÄôAvraham (ed. Uzziel Alnaddaf), Jerusalem 1992, p. 20 (Hebrew). There he settled in the Old City of Jerusalem and began to work on behalf of the small Jewish community that had immigrated there in 1882, supporting himself as a silversmith and teaching children the rudiments of Jewish education. That same year, he took in marriage a second wife. Emissary Rabbi Avraham Al-Naddaf made several trips to Yemen in subsequent years as a rabbinic envoy in order to raise money for the beleaguered Jews of Yemen who had immigrated some years earlier. He became the chief sponsor for building a hostelry and Beit midrash for his community in Jerusalem,Shalom 'Uzayri, Galei-Or, Tel-Aviv 1974, p. 23 (Hebrew). as well as initiated the first printing of a Yemenite Siddur, with the Etz ·∏§ayim commentary of Maharitz, as well as Hebrew Bible codices which were proofread by him and by the Chief Rabbi of Yemen, Rabbi Yihya Yitzhak Halevi, and sent by post to Jerusalem.Shelomo Al-Naddaf, Zekhor Le‚ÄôAvraham (ed. Uzziel Alnaddaf), Jerusalem 1992, p. 27, note 115 (Hebrew). These printed codices, published by Zukerman Publishers in Jerusalem, only contained the first Five Books of Moses (Pentateuch), known as the Torah. The small, one- room apartment for a hostelry was eventually built in Jerusalem‚Äôs Na·∏•alat Zvi neighborhood.Shelomo Al-Naddaf, Zekhor Le‚ÄôAvraham (ed. Uzziel Alnaddaf), Jerusalem 1992, p. 39 (Hebrew). In 1892, at the resignation of Rabbi Yi·∏•ya ·π¢ƒÅroum, Rabbi Al-Naddaf was elected by the community to replace him and to head the Yemenite Jewish community.Shelomo Al-Naddaf, Zekhor Le‚ÄôAvraham (ed. Uzziel Alnaddaf), Jerusalem 1992, pp. 23 ‚Äì 24 (Hebrew). He immediately set-out to forbid Jewish contact with foreign organisations suspected of acting as missionaries. He writes of this period: ‚ÄúAt first, we forbade [them] and made them outcasts in the community, anyone who would go again to receive any money, or any clothing, as they did before from the instigators, and even more so those who would go there to listen to their preaching on Sunday in their house of convocation. While even those who would go to work a menial job in their field, such as at the field of Schneller (i.e. the German-run Syrian Orphanage, established in 1861 by the German missionary, Johann Ludwig Schneller, and built far beyond the walls of the Old City, on lands purchased from the villagers of Lifta), be it only for a few hours of the day, so that they might receive their monthly or weekly wages for paying rent, we forbade unto them the clothing that they would give on occasion to the working men. We made it known to them and warned them to desist from receiving [anything from them]. And, thanks be to the blessed God, those who had formerly gone there or who had been errant therein were prevented from doing so. Only a very few refused to change their manner, and would still go there in secret, and occasionally they'd bring [what they needed] for themselves and take it to their houses in a non-conspicuous manner, but they were held in disdain and for a reproach in the eyes of all the congregation, until at length they too desisted [from going there].‚ÄùShelomo Al-Naddaf, Zekhor Le‚ÄôAvraham (ed. Uzziel Alnaddaf), Jerusalem 1992, p. 24 (Hebrew). Initially, the Sephardic seminaries (Heb. Kollelim) had received the Yemenite Jews when they first arrived in Jerusalem, but cultural differences forced the Yemenites to separate from their co-religionists and to establish their own seminary.Shelomo Al-Naddaf, Zekhor Le‚ÄôAvraham (ed. Uzziel Alnaddaf), Jerusalem 1992, p. 56 (Hebrew). They were also being taxed by the Sephardic community, money that was to go to the public coffers, but they were not being allotted an equal share or subsidy as had been given to the Sephardic Jews. This added to their insult. Legacy In 1903, Rabbi Avraham Al-Naddaf published the community's first Yemenite siddur, Tefillat Kol Pe. In 1907, largely due to the tireless efforts of Rabbi Avraham Al-Naddaf, the Ottoman government recognized the Yemenite Jewish community in Palestine as an independent Jewish community, distinct from the Sephardic Jews and Jews of Ashkenaz. The community leader who answered to the government was Rabbi (mori) Avraham ·π¢ƒÅroum.Yaakov Ramon, Yehudei Teiman be‚ÄôTel-Aviv (The Jews of Yemen in Tel-Aviv), Jerusalem 1935, p. 15 (Hebrew) In 1910, the Yemenite Jewish community in Jerusalem and in Silwan purchased on credit a parcel of ground on the Mount of Olives for burying their dead, through the good agencies of Albert Ant√©bi and with the assistance of the philanthropist, Baron Edmond Rothschild. The next year, the community was coerced into buying its adjacent property, by insistence of the Mukhtar (headman) of the village Silwan, and which considerably added to their holdings.Shelomo Al-Naddaf, Zekhor Le‚ÄôAvraham (ed. Uzziel Alnaddaf), Jerusalem 1992, pp. 56‚Äì57 (Hebrew) During World War I, Rabbi Al-Naddaf issued a proclamation in the name of the Rabbinate of the Yemenite Jews in Jerusalem, addressed to the Yemenite Jews in Palestine about registration.David Solomon Sassoon, Ohel Dawid (Descriptive catalogue of the Hebrew and Samaritan Manuscripts in the Sassoon Library, London), vol. 1, Oxford Univ. Press: London 1932, p. 390, section 215 (G). During the outbreak of the First World War he was drafted in the Ottoman army, but managed to evade actual military service through the efforts of three Jewish elders who appealed to the Ottoman commander, Jamal Pasha, to relieve him. After the British usurped control over Palestine toward the end of 1917, during the start of the Hanukka holiday, all conscripts were then made exempt from military duty.Shelomo Al-Naddaf, Zekhor Le‚ÄôAvraham (ed. Uzziel Alnaddaf), Jerusalem 1992, p. 58 (Hebrew). Later in life, the rabbi with his second wife and their children moved to the Bukharim quarter in Jerusalem, before eventually moving to Tel-Aviv in 1925 where he made a livelihood from ritual slaughter of livestock and as a scrivener of legal documents. Al-Naddaf made commentaries and annotations to Rabbi Yihya Saleh's Questions & Responsa Pe'ulat Sadiq, a work published by Shemuel Badi·∏•i in two editions. In his old-age, he wrote an autobiography, later published by his son, and re-printed by his grandson. Rabbi Avraham Al-Naddaf died on 21 February 1940 in Tel-Aviv‚Äôs Kerem HaTeimanim, and was buried by his three surviving sons and daughter in the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem.

It is about an hour's drive away from Helsinki area, and fifteen minutes drive from Lahti. Pajulahti has a history of over 80 years.Jukka Hako : \\"Ponnistuspaikka - Pajulahden urheiluopiston kahdeksan vuosikymment√§\\", Kellastupa Oy, Vantaa 2010 It was established in 1929 as a women gymnasts' summer training place. Pajulahti has grown into an active sports and leisure center during the last few decades. Pajulahti offers sport education, training facilities, conference and meeting facilities as well as fitness and wellness services. The Sport Institute is located close to nature and next to a lake. Both indoor and outdoor sports are taught there. There are about 350 students in Pajulahti Sports Institute. Since 2006, the executive director and the principal of the Sport Institute has been Lasse Mikkelsson. The director of the training center and executive vice president is Mikko Levola. The Adventure Park of Pajulahti Pajulahti has both hotel and dormitory type of accommodation. There is also a restaurant. The newest attraction of Pajulahti is The Adventure Park, that was opened in June 2015. Since November 2015, Pajulahti Sports Institute has been officially Finnish National Olympic Training Center. It is the only Olympic Training Center of Finland that is also the official Paralympic Training Center. http://www.seutuneloset.fi/uutiset/2015/11/23/pajulahdesta-olympiakomitean- valmennuskeskus  History  Pajulahti Sports Institute was founded in Nastola in June 1929, in the same location where the institute still operates today. The origin of the sports institute dates back to the early 1920s, when the women's section of the Finnish Workers‚Äô Sports Federation, founded in 1919, expressed the idea of to have a sports centre of its own. Funds for the project were raised throughout the 1920s, but it was not until spring 1929 that the federation decided to establish the sports centre. Thus it purchased a site in Nastola which already had a main building and sauna.Hako 2010, p. 95-101. In its early years, Pajulahti operated only in the summers. Courses were held there for leaders of women's exercise groups. In addition, it was also possible to enjoy a holiday at Pajulahti. Activities were adversely affected, however, by the fact that the site had no internal exercise facilities. Students were at the mercy of the weather. The centre eventually acquired its own gymnastics hall in 1937, while slightly earlier a swimming facility had been opened.Hako 2010, p. 101-111. Pajulahti served solely as a women's sports centre for nearly a decade, but after the opening of the gymnastics hall, the first men's courses were also held there. The activities of the Finnish Workers‚Äô Sports Federation expanded rapidly after the Second World War. The federation decided to launch a major funding-raising effort, with the aim of building a new sports institute. The fund-raising was a great success, but rather than a new institute it was finally decided instead to expand the existing facilities at Pajulahti. The new institute building was completed in 1949. Pajulahti began to train sports instructors and this led to the formation of a second institute which fell within the sphere of central government financial aid. Activities now took place all year round.Hako 2010, p. 101-118. Weight lifting in the Nikula hall In 1952 the Finnish Workers‚Äô Sports Federation decided to separate Pajulahti into an independent unit. A Sports Institute Foundation, to which the Pajulahti land and buildings were transferred, was established to maintain the institute. The foundation remains Pajulahti's owner still today. The expansion of activities called for additional accommodation, housing for staff and new sports areas. The 1950s was a time of construction at Pajulahti. The next period of strong growth took place in the 1970s, when Pajulahti obtained a new main building with ball-game halls and a training pool for swimming. More accommodation was also built. In the late 1980s the main building was extended further and an indoor tennis facility and a new residential unit constructed. The sports field acquired an artificial surface in the early 1990s.Hako 2010, p. 114-118. The biggest change in the early 1990s was the establishment of Pajulahti's operations as an independent company. After a change in tax law, the Sports Institute Foundation, which funds sports education with grants, decided to avoid a situation in which it would be engaged in taxable business operations. In cooperation with the Ministry of Education, Pajulahti was formed into a limited company, \\"Valtakunnallinen valmennus- ja liikuntakeskus Oy\\" in 1996.Hako 2010, p. 159-177.The Pajulahti Hall After the formation of the company, Pajulahti has grown further and construction has been busier than ever. The late 1990s and the following decade saw the completion of an ice hall, a swimming hall, a cafeteria, an accommodation facility and a sports hall. A highlight is the new Pajulahti Hall, which was officially opened in 2010. The hall is mainly used by footballers and athletes. Pajulahti is also used by the following sports activities: tennis, figure skating, swimming, judo, physical exercise for special groups, ice-hockey, volleyball and wrestling. Hako 2010, p. 177-188. Pajulahti's objectives are clear. The former women's sports centre has developed into a national and international sports institute, that wants to participate in promoting the health and exercise of Finns, develop the training of sports instructors and to be in the forefront of raising Finnish elite sportsmen and women back among the world's best.

All of the brothers have now grown up into lazy NEETs, with each brother having developed their own distinguishing personality. The series follows the brothers in their everyday (and occasionally made up) lives. Characters Matsuno siblings The Matsuno siblings as depicted in Mr. Osomatsu. From left to right: Todomatsu, Osomatsu, Karamatsu, Choromatsu, Ichimatsu, and Jyushimatsu. =Osomatsu Matsuno= is the eldest of the sextuplets and self-proclaimed leader of the group. An avid gambler, he spends his time playing pachinko and betting on horses. He often dresses in red. =Karamatsu Matsuno= is the second born of the sextuplets. Believes himself to be cooler and more popular than he really is and calls his fan girls \\"Karamatsu Girls.\\" He occasionally adds English words into his sentences. His distinguishing feature is his thick eyebrows and he often dresses in blue, though he occasionally sports a leather jacket and sunglasses. =Choromatsu Matsuno= is the third born and most responsible of the sextuplets. Often acts as straight man to his siblings. His distinguishing features are his angular mouth, smaller pupils, and his lack of a cowlick. He often dresses in green. =Ichimatsu Matsuno= is the fourth born of the sextuplets and the sharp-tongued loner of the group. His distinguishing features are his tired eyes, scruffy hair, hunched back, and he often dresses in purple. =Jyushimatsu Matsuno= is the fifth born of the sextuplets. He is very energetic but also quite the airhead, often having no reaction to the wild goings-on. He has a wide open mouth, and a single cowlick compared to the other siblings' two. He often dresses in yellow. =Todomatsu Matsuno= is the most outgoing of the sextuplets. Often uses his cuteness as a brother to manipulate others. He has a smaller mouth, and bigger pupils. He often dresses in pink. Other characters Some of the supporting characters.

He is best known as author of Rhodesian Patrol, an autobiographical account of his time in the BSAP. Early life Frank Eric Lloyd was born in Chester, Cheshire, England, the second son of Joseph and Elizabeth Lloyd, who owned Lloyd's Cooperage in Watergate Row, Chester. Career in British South Africa Police After travelling to Cape Town, South Africa in 1931 to join the British South Africa Police, he was accepted as a recruit and spent five months training in Salisbury (now Harare), Southern Rhodesia. He spent the early part of his police career on mounted patrol in the Matopo Hills (now Matobo National Park). During the early part of World War II while stationed at Bulawayo he absconded in an attempt to fight in the East African Campaign. He crossed into Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) at Victoria Falls and at Broken Hill (now Kabwe) stowed away in the army convoy of the 4th Rhodesian Anti Tank Battery who were en route to Kenya. After several days travelling he was discovered and arrested at Mpika and tried back at Salisbury for desertion, receiving a sentence of six weeks with hard labour. Subsequent to the war, he was stationed at Miami (now Mwami) in West Mashonaland and later at Sipolilo (now Guruve) in Central Mashonaland. He retired from the BSAP in 1955. His autobiographical account of life in the BSAP, Rhodesian Patrol, was published in 1965. Career after retirement from BSAP His later career was in the service of the Duke of Westminster during which time he lived at Eccleston Lodge on the Duke's Eaton estate. Private life While stationed at Sinoia (now Chinhoyi) in 1941, he met Jane Wray McCrudden, a Nursing sister at Sinoia Hospital and originally from Belfast, Northern Ireland.

It is commonly filled with neon gas or argon gas and contains a bimetallic strip and a stationary electrode. The operating principle is simple, when current is applied, the gas inside ionizes and heats a bimetallic strip which in turn bends toward the stationary electrode thus shorting the starter between the electrodes of the fluorescent lamp After a second the starter's bimetallic strip will cool and open the circuit between the electrodes and the process repeats until the lamp has lit. One disadvantage of glow switch starters is that when the lamp is at the end of its life it will continuously blink on and off until the glow switch starter wears out or an electrode on the fluorescent lamp burns out. Operation A preheat fluorescent lamp circuit using an automatic starting switch. A: Fluorescent tube, B: Power (+220 volts), C: Starter, D: Switch (bi- metallic thermostat), E: Capacitor, F: Filaments, G: Ballast When power is first applied to the circuit, there will be a glow discharge across the electrodes in the starter lamp. This heats the gas in the starter and causes one of the bi-metallic contacts to bend towards the other. When the contacts touch, the two filaments of the fluorescent lamp and the ballast will effectively be switched in series to the supply voltage. The current through the filaments causes them to heat up and emit electrons into the tube gas by thermionic emission. In the starter, the touching contacts short out the voltage sustaining the glow discharge, extinguishing it so the gas cools down and no longer heats the bi-metallic switch, which opens within a second or two. The current through the filaments and the inductive ballast is abruptly interrupted, leaving the full line voltage applied between the filaments at the ends of the tube and generating an inductive kick which provides the high voltage needed to start the lamp. The lamp will fail to strike if the filaments are not hot enough, in which case the cycle repeats; several cycles are usually needed, which causes flickering and clicking during starting (older thermal starters behaved better in this respect). A power factor correction (PFC) capacitor draws leading current from the mains to compensate for the lagging current drawn by the lamp circuit. Once the tube strikes, the impinging main discharge keeps the cathodes hot, permitting continued electron emission without the need for the filaments to continue to be heated. The starter switch does not close again because the voltage across the lit tube is insufficient to start a glow discharge in the starter. With automated starters such as glow starters, a failing tube will cycle endlessly, flickering as the lamp quickly goes out because the emission mix is insufficient to keep the lamp current high enough to keep the glow starter open. This runs the ballast at higher temperature. Some more advanced starters time out in this situation, and do not attempt repeated starts until power is reset. Some older systems used a thermal over-current trip to detect repeated starting attempts and disable the circuit until manually reset. The switch contacts in glow starters are subject to wear and inevitably fail eventually, so the starter is manufactured as a plug-in replaceable unit.

Plot At the age of 7, when Jesus returns from Egypt to his home in Nazareth with his family, he discovers the truth about his life.Nick Schager, variety.com, Film Review: ‚ÄòThe Young Messiah‚Äô, USA, MARCH 11, 2016 He realizes he is the Son of God, sent by God, to be the savior of humanity. The movie begins with Jesus playing in Alexandria with his cousins when one of the local boys \\"Eliezer\\" beats Jesus and then turns to his female cousin. Lucifer throws an apple before the bully Eliezer and he falls to his death. Then Lucifer turns the crowd against the young boy Jesus and they gather around accusing him of cursing Eliezer. His mother saves him from the mob but as he and his cousins hide in the house they ask the young Jesus to do to Eliezer what he did to the young bird. The camera cuts to a flashback of a young Jesus bringing a dead bird to life. Jesus sneaks out of the house and into Eliezer's home where preparations are being made for his disemboweling and burial. When he raises Eliezer from the dead the boy promptly resumes beating Jesus. Eliezer's parents ask Joseph, Jesus and Mary to leave Alexandria saying \\"7 years is more than enough\\". Joseph tells Mary, uncle Cleopas and his extended family that he had a dream and it is time to return to Israel because King Herod the Great is dead. Mary insists on returning to Nazareth instead of Bethlehem. The family departs for Israel. On the road to Israel Jesus and his family encounter an increasingly unwell Cleopas coughing and though Mrs. Cleopas asks Jesus to heal him , Jesus says he cannot because he has been asked not to. As the family rests Jesus runs off to play and walks straight into an ambush with rebellious Jews waiting for a passing Roman cavalry. One of the rebels tries to turn away the boy Jesus and when the Romans become suspicious and the attack commences the rebel pushes away the young Jesus from harm's way and sacrifices his own life. One of the Centurions saves the boy Jesus from one of the Roman soldiers. Jesus runs back to his family to find Cleopas increasingly delirious and raving by the river Jordan. Jesus cannot resist and moves to heal his uncle Cleopas. As he heals his uncle the news spreads and reaches the new Jewish King, Herod Archelaus, Herod the Great's son, who orders his Roman Centurion to find the boy healer and execute him. Jesus and the family run into a man raping a lady by the roadside . The lady knifes the attacker and kills him. Joseph and Uncle Cleopas bury the dead attacker and the victim joins the family on their road to Nazareth. On the way to Nazareth Jesus and the holy family encounter crucifixions of Jewish rebels. Upon arrival at their family home in Nazareth the Roman soldiers arrive and accuse them of banditry and rebellion. Grandmother Sarah arrives in the nick of time and share sweet cakes and good wine to give to the soldiers. The soldiers are won over by the hospitality and spare Joseph and the extended clan. The centurion returns to Herod Archelaus in the middle of a belly dancing entertainment. He informs the Centurion that he just crucified a man who told him about the return of Jesus. The crucified informant tells the Centurion of the general direction and informs him of a camel he gave to the boy as a gift. The child Jesus is taken to the rabbi for schooling. He amazes them with his wisdom and knowledge and they accept him but Jesus faints on the way back. Lucifer torments Jesus as he lies unwell and tells him that his little miracles will mean nothing. Jesus is restored to health and he asks to visit Jerusalem for Passover. The centurions track Jesus to Sarah's house in Nazareth but they have already departed for Jerusalem. The soldiers extract information about the boy's name. The soldiers intercept the travelers on the road but the family departs from the road and hides in the caves. Jesus departs from the cave in the middle of the night for Jerusalem all by himself asking God for guidance and safety. Jesus enters Jerusalem, his parents follow looking for him. Jesus is given some coins by well meaning pilgrims and he uses the coins to save a sacrificial dove and sets it free. Jesus finds a blind rabbi and asks about what happened 7 years ago in Bethlehem. Lucifer guides the Centurions to the boy by the rabbi. The rabbi is healed by the young Jesus. The centurion corners Jesus and the people in the temple gather around Jesus claiming him to be the boy who healed the Rabbi. Recognizing that all eyes are on him, the Centurion Severus desists from killing the boy and asks them to leave the temple. Severus the Centurion falsely reports to Herod Archelaus that the young Jesus was murdered by him. Mary tells Jesus the answers to all the questions he was looking for. The movie ends with Jesus running to his family and just wanting to be a child.

Focus Features acquired the US rights from FilmDistrict, and set the film to begin production in September 2014. Reception Box office In the United States and Canada, the film opened on March 11, 2016 alongside 10 Cloverfield Lane, The Brothers Grimbsy and The Perfect Match. It was originally projected to gross $7‚Äì8 million in its opening weekend, however after grossing just $1.4 million on its opening day, estimates were lowered to $3‚Äì4 million. It ended up grossing $3.3 million in its opening weekend, finishing 7th at the box office. Critical response The film has gathered mixed to negative critical responses. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 47%, based on 35 reviews, with an average rating of 5.6/10. On Metacritic the film has a score of 33 out of 100, based on 9 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"A‚Äì\\" on an A+ to F scale. A review by TheBlaze states that \\"if you‚Äôre really keen on seeing this film, you probably won‚Äôt be disappointed\\". Steven D. Greydanus reviewed The Young Messiah for the National Catholic Register, saying it was smartly adapted by Cyrus and Betsy Nowrasteh. Greydanus said he could imagine watching the film with a mixed group of people of faith and no faith while holding everyone's interest. He says this project could have turned into \\"the greatest imaginable act of authorial hubris and irrelevance\\", except that the filmmakers found an elegant solution in drawing on both the Gospels and the apocryphal Gospels, while reworking all the material to bring it into conformance with right beliefs among Christians. Greydanus says that \\"The Young Messiah offers an imaginative vision of the most iconic and celebrated family in human history that is both surprising and familiar, warmly human and credible yet also different.\\" References External links  * Official resources website 2016 films American films English-language films 2016 drama films American drama films Films scored by John Debney Films about babies Films about children Films based on American novels Films based on the Gospels Films directed by Cyrus Nowrasteh Films produced by Chris Columbus Films produced by Michael Barnathan Films set in ancient Egypt Films shot in Italy Films shot in Rome Films shot in Matera Portrayals of Jesus in film CJ Entertainment films 1492 Pictures films Focus Features films Films based on works by Anne Rice ","title":"The Young Messiah"},{"id":"47201945","text":"Stonehenge is a locality in the Toowoomba Region, Queensland, Australia.

In the late 80s, he worked for Gramavision, and later TVT Records as a Controller assisting with the transition from a novelty label to a roster of indie bands including Nine Inch Nails, The Connells and later Sevendust, Aphex Twin and others. 1990 - Current After leaving TVT, he formed MixUp NYC, a recording and production studio. He also toured with Peter Gabriel (Secret World Live), David Bowie (Black Tie, White Noise) and worked on the pre-production of Madonna's The Girlie Show. In 1993 he began his long association with Abkco Records. His most notable works for Abkco includes films for The Rolling Stones, Alejandro Jodorowsky and Sam Cooke. Gochanour also produced and/or directed music videos, commercials and promotional films for The Animals, The Herman's Hermits, Metric, Virgin Air and others. As a sound designer, composer and musical supervisor, he has specialized in nature documentaries for Turner Broadcast, World Wildlife Organization and the Discovery Channel. He composed the soundtrack for T-Rex: New Science, New Beast (2007) for Emmy-winning director Ann Johnson-Prum. His songs have been produced and recorded by artist Ben Green, Jimi Zhivago, Percy Jones and others. The Rolling Stones In 1993 Gochanour was hired as an independent contractor by Abkco Films to produce a trailer for Jean-Luc Godard's newly restored film Sympathy for the Devil. Allen Klein, former manager of The Rolling Stones, Sam Cooke and The Beatles, asked him to research and work on the unfinished, never released The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus. He and Robin Klein (long-time co-producer) were sent to London where they found missing footage of The Who in a storage vault. They spent another 2 years developing, editing and restoring the footage and soundtrack. The film premiered at the 1996 New York Film Festival. For the DVD release in 2004, Mick produced (and directed) an additional 6 hours of supplementary content, including the music video for the Fat Boy Slim remix of ‚ÄúSympathy for the Devil‚Äù. In 2008, ABKCO approached director Albert Maysles regarding the coming 40th anniversary of The Rolling Stone's legendary 1969 Madison Square Garden concerts. Mick and Ms. Klein were given access to the outtakes from the 1970 film Gimme Shelter, which included footage from the shows. The resulting film was the short documentary Get Yer Ya Ya‚Äôs Out, which featured cameos by Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and The Grateful Dead. While researching archives for the upcoming 50th anniversary of The Rolling Stones, Mick discovered several hours of unprocessed film shot by Peter Whitehead during their 1965 promotional tour. In 2012 he wrote, produced (uncredited) and directed Ireland 1965 (aka Charlie is My Darling) and also restored Mr. Whitehead's original 35-minute unreleased film. The soundtrack won a Grammy in 2014. Alejandro Jodorowsky Gochanour's familiarity with the abandoned Jodorowsky film project of Genesis‚Äô The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway led to his being a champion for bringing Alejandro's early films Fando y Lis, El Topo and The Holy Mountain back into the public, which were out of circulation and under Abkco Films‚Äô control. He subsequently became co-producer of the restorations in 2002, working closely with the director. They were released in 2004. In early 2013, Alejandro invited Mick and co-producer Robin Klein to Paris where they were given an advanced screening of The Dance of Reality, which led to the acquisition of the film for Abkco. Gochanour won The American Graphics award for the design of the movie poster, which featured the on-set photography of artist Pascal Montondan. Sam Cooke In 2004, Gochanour won a Grammy for his work on Sam Cooke Portrait of a Legend 1951-1964, the first film/video biography of the artist, based on the Peter Guralnick book Dream Boogie.

History The first known sun-shade patent is from 1911 and belongs to Frank H. Ilse of Chicago. There is no prior art cited with this patent, although a similar contraption was devised for hats in 1908, as mentioned in the patent application.Curtain for Vehicle. Frank H. Ilse's patent from 1911 Years later in 1970, The Israeli businessman Avraham Levy invented an accordion-like cardboard sun blocker and claimed he sold 1 million of the devices in Israel since the mid-1970s. Avi Fattal and Avi Ruimi, two young Israeli who migrated to the US, after being confronted by Levi for taking his idea without permission, modified the concept of Levi and changed the design into the shape of sunglasses, thus penetrating the American market.. Usage Windshield Sun Shades Typically, the glass of the car's windshield itself blocks most of the UV light from the sun, and some of the infrared radiation. But it can't protect from the visible light that mostly penetrates through the window and gets absorbed by the objects inside the car. The visible light that passes into the interior through the windshield is converted into the infrared light which, in its turn, is blocked by the glass and gets trapped inside, heating up the interior. Some windshield sun shades have a reflective surface to bounce the light without hitting the objects in the car, reducing the interior temperature. Car sun shades are mainly used in environments with strong and direct sunshine, and thus their usage is mostly seasonal and tied to the weather of countries. During the summer they help decrease the inside temperature of the parked carshttps://www.digitaltrends.com/outdoors/how-to- sleep-comfortably-in-a-car/ or protect passengers from direct UV rays. Sunlight passing through the car's windshield produces the greenhouse effect, heating the interior to a temperature much higher than the outside air. Without any protection, the sun can heat up a car's dark dashboards to 69 degrees Celsius within 60 minutes.. This is dangerous for adults children and animals. Prolonged exposure to direct sunlight can also make the dashboard fade and eventually crack, or cause damage to items left in the car, such as mobile phones, laptops and other electronic devices. Sunshades may also be used while resting in a car, creating a sense of privacy and blocking out most of the undesired outside light from the sun in the daytime or from other cars and street lights at nighttime. Types thumb There are several variants of car sun shade types. Typically, sun shields are made of a layer of mylar or aluminum foil which covers the inside of the car's windows, to reflect the sun's rays away, and preventing the interior from being exposed to those rays. There are sunshades specifically designed to fit the inside of the front windshield of the car, and others designed for the car's side windows, or the back window. There are small rectangular shaped shades for babies made from dark nylon mesh which are attached to the window with a suction cup. These usually do not cover the whole window. There are also self-adhesive sunshades which rely on static electricity to adhere to the window.. Custom-made car sunshades with additional fastening elements such as hooks, clasps, buckles or magnets that attach to the car frame or shade, are prepared to fit specific car models, and may cover the entire side-window of a car. In a similar way there exist folding sunshades which can be attached to the side window of any car with magnets.. Some car shades are designed for winter use and attach to the outside of the windshield (typically with straps) to keep the window free of snow and ice..

Johanna Weber (8 August 1910 ‚Äì 24 October 2014) a German-born British mathematician and aerodynamicist, best known for her contributions to the development of the Handley Page Victor bomber and the Concorde. Early life Johanna Weber was born in a family of Walloon origin in D√ºsseldorf, Germany, on August 8, 1910. Her father died in the First World War. As a 'war orphan', Weber was eligible for financial support, and she attended a convent school. In 1929, she began studies in chemistry and mathematics at the University of Cologne, but switched a year later to the University of G√∂ttingen. She graduated with a first class honours degree in 1935, and then trained as a teacher for two years. As she did not join the Nazi party, she was not allowed to join a teaching post. Her remaining family, comprising her mother and sister, were in need of financial support, so she sought employment in the armaments industry. Career Weber joined Krupp in Essen as a researcher in ballistics. Her work involved tedious mathematical computations using the Brunsviga mechanical calculators. Aerodynamics Research Institute In 1939, Weber joined the Aerodynamics Research Institute (Aerodynamische Versuchsanstalt G√∂ttingen) in G√∂ttingen. As part of a small theoretical team, her initial training in aerodynamics consisted of wind tunnel corrections. Here she met and began her lifelong collaboration with Dietrich K√ºchemann. Scientists at Institute had by then worked out a consistent theory of flow around an aircraft. This was, however, an approximation, using singularities to represent the vortices that generated lift, and Weber was tasked with improving it. She realised that some of her work overlapped with K√ºchemann's research on jet engine intakes. They teamed up, with Weber doing the theoretical development and wind tunnel testing, and K√ºchemann setting the direction of their research based on his consultation with manufacturers. Over the period of the Second World War, they created a substantial body of work. Royal Aircraft Establishment Following the capture of G√∂ttingen by the US Army in 1945, the city fell into the British occupation zone. The British paid Weber and K√ºchemann to compile a monograph of their researches. These would form the basis of their text Aerodynamics of Propulsion. They also encouraged German scientists to take up six month contracts at various defence facilities in the UK as part of the combined US-UK plan (Operation Paperclip and Operation Surgeon) to acquire German services and technologies. In October 1946, K√ºchemann joined the Aerodynamics department at the Royal Aircraft Establishment in Farnbourough, and persuaded Weber to join him. Both of them continued to renew their six- month contracts, although both remained classed as enemy aliens, until 1953 when both were naturalised as British citizens. Weber, as the only woman among the German scientists, was accommodated at an RAE staff hostel. She joined the Low Speed Wind Tunnels division at the RAE, which was headed by Frances Bradfield. She began experimental work on air intakes under John Seddon. In 1946, the British Air Ministry specified a medium-range jet propelled bomber capable of carrying a nuclear weapon. The Handley Page Victor bomber was the most ambitious of the designs proposed in response. K√ºchemann had kept abreast of German work into swept-wing aircraft, in particular the crescent-shaped wing, and the aerodynamics of supersonic flight. The Victor would have three segmented wings of crescent shape, each with a different sweep angle. Weber assisted with the calculations, and incorporated further design improvements including the engine air inputs based on the work she had done with K√ºchemann during the war. Her linear and simple aerodynamic models were calculated by hand by a team of women 'computors'. In September 1945, she co-wrote with K√ºchemann a paper analysing the aerodynamics of the new wing and fuselage. Weber's subsequent work with K√ºchemann was in improving the theory of subsonic aerodynamics. Initial methods treated wing thickness and lift in isolation. In the 1950s, she developed a simultaneous treatment of all the features of a wing (thickness, twist, sweepback, camber) to predict the air pressure distribution over it. The Vickers aircraft team then solved the inverse problem - that of determining the wing shape that best suited a required pressure distribution. The resultant wing shape, the most advanced for a civilian craft, was used on the Vickers VC10 airliner. Concorde Weber also began her research into supersonic transport. In 1955, she showed that a thin delta wing with a high angle of attack could generate sufficient lift to provide the take-off and landing capability, while simultaneously enabling efficient supersonic performance. K√ºchemann then advocated this wing configuration with the UK Government, resulting in the support for a Mach 2 airliner by the Supersonic Transport Advisory Committee (STAC) in 1956. In 1961, a prototype aircraft, the Handley Page HP.115, was built to test the low speed performance of the slender delta wing. Weber made two fundamental contributions to the supersonic effort: tools to predict the drag on a slender delta-winged aircraft during supersonic flight, and shaping the wing to allow the formation of vortices at its leading edge, rather than above or below it. Her work from 1959 onwards contributed to the design and the eventual construction of the Concorde. Airbus Weber reverted to subsonic researches following the Concorde. In particular, she analysed the conditions under which methods addressing airflows slower than the speed of sound continued to be applicable at supercritical levels. Her refinement of existing theories, which were based on incompressible flows, helped automate the computations to render exact, rather than approximate, solutions. One of the chief sources of aerodynamic inefficiency was the junction of the wing and the fuselage, and she was able to model its entire three-dimensional profile. These methods, along with others evolving from the development of the VC10, were used in the design of the Airbus A300B aircraft, the first wide-body twinjet in the world. Later life and death Weber retired in 1975 at the grade of Senior Principal Scientific Officer, and continued to be retained by the RAE as a consultant. She had nearly 100 papers to her name. In 1976, following K√ºchemann's death, Weber assisted in the publication of his book The Aerodynamic Design of Aircraft, published in 1978. She announced that she was done with aerodynamics after that. Weber remained unmarried all her life. She lived in the RAE hostel until 1953, and then moved into a bedsit attached to K√ºchemann's house in Wrecclesham, Surrey, where she lived till 1961. That year, she acquired her house next door to the K√ºchemanns. She found it difficult to obtain a mortgage, as banks tended not to lend to single women at the time. After retirement, Weber discovered new interests in psychology and geology, taking classes at the University of Surrey. Weber's younger sister, to whom she was very close, had been in poor health for most of her life. Weber supported her and their mother financially, sending money to Germany, and wanted to return to them. Her sister died at the age of 50. Weber lived in her house till 2010. She died in a nursing home in Farnham, Surrey, on 24 October 2014.

Agriculture in Liberia is a major sector of the country's economy worth 38.8% of GDP, employing more than 70% of the population and providing a valuable export for one of the world‚Äôs least developed countries (as defined by the UN). Liberia has a climate favourable to farming, vast forests, and an abundance of water, yet low yields mean that over half of foodstuffs are imported, with net agricultural trade at -$73.12 million in 2010. This was dismissed as a \\"misconception\\" by Liberia‚Äôs Minister of Agriculture. The major crops are natural rubber, rice, cassava, bananas and palm oil. Timber is also a major export at $100 million annually, although much of this is the product of unsustainable habitat destruction, with Asian corporations criticised for their role. Although agricultural activity occurs in most rural locations, it is particularly concentrated in coastal plains (subsistence crops) and tropical forest (cash crops). The sector is very important for women as they are widely employed in it in comparison to the economy as a whole.  History  Deys, Bassa, Kru, and the West Atlantic Gola and Kissi, are likely to be the first inhabitants of the region of present-day Liberia. Their migration was caused by the decline of the Malian Empire in 1375 and Songhay in 1591. Favourable arable land in comparison to their homelands also brought them in the area. Alongside their social and cultural customs, these immigrants also took with them rice, tuber and cotton cultivation. Evidence for this comes from early European merchants, such as Pedro de Cintra, who arrived in 1461. When the first American slaves were repatriated to Liberia in 1822, they met hostile tribes. The people and their farming was little-changed from centuries previously. However, settlers developed commercial agriculture, growing most of the crops the country now grows today. The industry was still noted as inefficient and primitive in the 1850s, but had considerable potential for trade in produce: \\"If the land was cleared, it would be excellent land for corn, eddoes, cassada, cane, and rice\\". However, in the 1870s the agricultural sector witnessed a prolonged crisis due to falling prices of cocoa and sugar as well as coffee being introduced to Brazil. In the first half of the 20th Century, the nation received loans from the United States, who created it, developing its economy and agriculture. In World War II, due to south east Asia's rubber's control by Japan, the United States invested heavily in Liberia, especially in agricultural infrastructure. In the 1990s the government was criticised for selling rights for deforestation to foreign companies, who exploited the bio-diverse hardwood rainforest. This resulted in many reforestation programmes, although woodland is still destroyed for other uses, such as iron ore mining. Indeed, 98% of the population rely on firewood for fuel, and trees are still cut down for export to Europe and to grow plants. Liberia also lost 70% of its rare mangrove forest at the coast by the mid-1980s. Only a quarter of the original evergreen rainforest is left and almost all the remainder of the land is a mosaic of crops, shrubs and planted trees, in contrast to the Great Plains of its founding country. Much of the industry was devastated by two civil wars ('89-'96 and '99-'03), with rice production falling by 76% between 1987 and 2005. However, the fighting completely destroyed almost all other sectors of the economy, causing agriculture's share of GDP to rise from 40% in 1990 to 95% in 1996. Chronic malnutrition was (and still is) widespread, caused by a lack of infrastructure, poverty due to unemployment and low use of fertilisers and pesticides (below 1%). Nevertheless, recent investment from foreign companies has resulted in cash crop production rising since 2006 with the percentage of households producing them doubling from 28% in 2006 to 46% in 2009 and 55% in 2012. The main cash crops are rubber, coffee, and cocoa. This followed a successful election in 2005, which allowed a democratic government to rebuild infrastructure.  Land  Half of Liberia's total landmass is forest (4.9 million hectares) and 47% is arable land, although most of this is upland pasture. The 'slash and burn' technique is used extensively to convert woodland into rice paddies, often at the expense of biodiversity. The nation consists of flat, coastal plains and dwarf mountains further inland in the north east.  Soil  Three quarters of the country's land is made up of latosol, a reddish, mineral-rich but infertile soil found in tropical rainforest. While suitable for timber production, without leaf litter it quickly loses its fertility. This, in deforested area, combined with a lack of chemicals, causes Liberia's low yields.  Climate  A tropical climate gives high temperatures all-year round (roughly 27 ¬∞C), relative humidity of 65-80%, and heavy rainfall, especially in coastal regions with 3,500-4,600 mm. The rainy season lasts from May to October and leaves the region in water surplus for 5‚Äì8 months.  Livestock  The livestock sector accounts for 14% of GDP despite large areas of pasture after being devastated by the civil war. Almost all animals were eaten. This is also combined with a lack of rural credit and an unfavourable climate. For example, cattle population (per 1000) plummeted from 42 in 1985 to 36 a decade later. Grand Gedeh, Lofa, Bong, and Nimba counties harbour the majority of the cattle, sheep and goats. The most prevalent breeds of cattle are N‚ÄôDama and Muturu, although there have been limited attempts to cross breed these with larger cattle. The most common breed of ruminant in the West African Dwarf and there are also other types of goat. Over 80% of ruminants are kept in traditional village animal husbandry systems. The government constructed ranches and encouraged commercial cattle production but have all been since deserted. There is no dairy industry in Liberia and all milk is imported. Many of the problems with farming are also blamed on rural-urban migration: as the young move from the countryside to Monrovia and other cities, there is a shortage of labour for farming. The Food and Agriculture Organization identified the following problems in 2002: * Lack of improved breeding stock. * Lack of feed. * Diseases and unavailability of veterinary services. * Lack of adequate training of available livestock officers. * Lack of processing facilities. * Inadequate transportation and roads, and * Inadequate policy. * less payment to workers * low power or heavy machine FRANCIS KEMAH JR  Crops   Rice  Harvesting Rice in Liberia in 1965 Alongside cassava, rice is the staple food of the republic, with 238,000 tonnes produced in 2013. The foodstuff accounts for 22% of agricultural GDP, far higher than all livestock. However, the harvest still falls short of 1988 levels which were 299,000 tonnes even though the population has doubled. Yields are also low with most rice at 3 tonnes per hectare, less than half the average in the United States. In 1979, rice riots resulted in the destruction of $40 million worth of private property. Forty people were killed and 500 wounded. In the wake of the Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa, rice production has shifted away from the traditional 'breadbasket' Lofa, Nimba and Bong Counties to the south east following irrigation investment which tripled yields. The epidemic has also caused large price rises and overgrown rice fields, causing the government to declare a state of emergency.  Timber  Liberia has over 230 species of tree and 14 million acres of forest. Its tropical hardwoods are valuable, chiefly in luxury furniture abroad. The largest firm in the sector is the Indonesian- owned Oriental Timber Corporation, with about three million acres and it has invested over $100 million in sawmills.  Rubber  Rubber Tree Plantation in Margibi County, Liberia The rubber industry was born in the country when Hilary R. W. Johnson, the president, permitted a British firm to extract wild latex in 1890. Liberia Rubber Corporation, another British corporation, built a plantation at Mount Barclay two decades later, but both failed in their endeavours. During World War I, Britain and the Netherlands controlled 98% of the raw materials necessary for the production of rubber. In 1922, the Rubber Restriction Act was passed in Britain, increasing the cost of rubber. Then, in 1926, Mr. Harvey S. Firestone (a tyre company owner) obtained a 99-year lease for 4% of the country‚Äôs territory in exchange for a $5 million loan. This ensured the nation's rapid growth in the world natural rubber market in World War II. The 12,000 Liberian employees were paid low wages, because the Liberian government felt that \\"men with money in their pockets would eventually have demanded the ballot\\". Firestone gave Charles Taylor, the warlord who caused the deaths of 300,000 Liberians, millions of dollars to secure the future of the firm's plantations, but production was still stopped for 6 years from 1990. Despite making up 11% of its exports, there are estimated to be 600,000 ha. of overgrown rubber plantations, some 60 years old. Ergo, there is a large export potential in the redundant rubber-wood. The rubber industry is also diversifying, using trees which no longer produce latex as biomass.  Cassava  The shrub makes up 23% of Liberian agricultural GDP and is now the second most important food crop. It can be grown throughout the country, although the area covered may vary considerably for different counties. The Liberian Ministry of Agriculture stated that the total area covered by the crop in 1977 was 86,000 ha with an average yield of 1800 kg/ha, and that 26 percent of all agricultural households in the country grew the crop. Its cultivation increased rapidly in the early 1980s. In 1985 283,000 tonnes of cassava was made, 23% larger than the previous year. The same increase happened with the area harvested (113 100 ha) and yield per ha (2500 kg). Most Liberian cassava is processed into various forms for human consumption. Cassava is normally left in the ground until it is ready to be sold, eaten, or processed into a more durable form. The leaves are also often eaten as a vegetable and the FAO encourages their use as animal feed. Cassava can be ground into farina flour by removing the skin and grinding it in hammer mills or by hand in a traditional mortar. This is after it has been dried, most typically in the sun. Farina is produced throughout the country, especially in Bassa, Bomi and Nimba counties.  Coconut palm  The coconut palm is a versatile element of every local village. Its branches facilitate house building and thatched roofs. The leaves are used in baskets, nets and crude clothes. The fruit itself is high in energy as fat, and can make cooking oil, candles, soap, palm wine and dried flakes. The ash from burnt shells is also another constituent of the soap-making process. Fences, brooms and spoons can also be made from this crop.  International aid  Since 1977 the Food and Agriculture Organization has given aid to the country. It has encouraged diversification of farms with projects such as horticulture and snail-farming as well as improved yields after Chinese investment. Almost all investment in the country is dependent on foreign donations as the economy was all but destroyed after decades of conflict.  Ministry of Agriculture  The Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) is the government ministry responsible for the governance, management and promotion of agriculture, founded on May 11, 1972. The Ministry is responsible for the oversight of agronomy, animal husbandry and other agriculture industries, the economic organization of the agriculture and food industries, and national food security. The work of the Ministry is divided into sectors of Livestock Production, Agricultural Chemicals and Crop Production. The current Minister of Agriculture is Mogana S. Flomo Jr., Ph.D. Main Ministry offices are located in Monrovia.

Part of the African Plate, it is bounded by the Agulhas Ridge (part of the Agulhas-Falkland Fracture Zone) to the north and the Southwest Indian Ridge to the south; by the Meteor Rise to the west and the Agulhas Plateau to the east. Numerous bathymetric anomalies hint at the basin's dynamic tectonic history. Geology In a Late Paleocene (59-56 Ma) reconstruction of the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean (i.e. the separation of South America and Africa during the Gondwana break-up) the Meteor Rise lies conjugate to the Islas Orcadas Rise (east of the Falkland Plateau). The separation of the Meteor Rise and the Islas Orcadas Rise marks the beginning of the formation of the Agulhas Basin. The Agulhas Ridge extends from the northern tip of the Meteor Rise towards the Agulhas Bank south of South Africa. The ridge, however, ends abruptly in a small plateau at where it intersects a northeastward-trending spreading centre (the Agulhas Rift) that was abandoned during the Early Paleocene (61 Ma). The presence of a short-lived tectonic plate between these structures was first proposed by . They named it the Malvinas Plate and proposed that it was active from 90 Ma until the spreading ceased in the Agulhas Basin at 65 Ma. The plate is located at a proto-Bouvet Triple Junction. found that Late Cretaceous (100-66 Ma) fracture zones generated on the Agulhas Rift do not align with those north of the Agulhas Fracture Zone and cannot therefore have been formed by the spreading of South America and Africa. Furthermore, magnetic anomalies on the Malvinas Plate do not align with their conjugates on the African Plate if the spreading rates and directions of South America and Africa are used as a guide. They also noted that the Agulhas Fracture Zone do not lay perpendicular to traces of the South America-Africa spreading north of it and cannot, therefore, have been generate by this spreading.; The Agulhas Rift is the abandoned Malvinas-Africa ridge crest. 97 Ma the plate boundary in the Agulhas Basin was reorganised when the Mid-Atlantic Ridge made an eastward jump. This brought the boundary towards the Agulhas Plateau where excessive volcanism was building a large igneous province. The inception of the Malvinas Plate accompanied this shortening of the Agulas Fracture Zone. 61 Ma, the Malvinas Plate was finally incorporated into the African Plate when the Malvinas-Africa ridge was abandoned as the result of a westward ridge jump along the Agulhas-Falkland Fracture Zone. This second ridge jump reduced one of the most spectacular fracture zones in Earth's history -- in length -- to . Oceanography The Agulhas Current flows south along the African east coast. When it reaches the southern tip of Africa, it retroflects back into the Indian Ocean. At this retroflection it leakes warm core eddies known as Agulhas rings into the South Atlantic. This mesoscale anti-cyclonic rings feed the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) and are therefore believed to affect the global climate, although the connection between the leakage, AMOC, and climate change is still poorly understood. In the Agulhas basin, half of these rings are subdivided one or several times. A majority of the subdivided rings split at or near the bathymetric obstacles on the western side of the Agulhas Basin but almost a quarter of them also merge there either because of the obstacles or because of intense interaction with other rings. Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) originated in the Oligocene with the opening of the Drake Passage and the Tasmanian Seaway and resulted in the thermal insulation of Antarctica. AABW mixes with other masses in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) to form the Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW). In the Agulhas Basin CDW flows northward and is deflect mostly westward by the Agulhas Ridge. A branch of CDW, however, enters the Cape Basin west of the ridge from where it flows west along the northern side of the ridge before being deflected north-east (along the Walvis Ridge) at the eastern end of the ridge. This long detour in the Cape Basin and mixing with North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) results in warmer water than other CDW masses. Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) flows above the CDW in the Agulhas Basin in an anti-cyclonic path (in contrast to the cyclonic path followed by CDW.)

It operates as a public- private partnership and a UK registered charity headquartered in Edinburgh. GALVmed‚Äôs purpose is \\"protecting livestock, improving human lives\\" and its mission is to improve the livelihoods of resource-poor farmers by providing animal health tools within a sustainable economic framework. The intended beneficiaries of GALVmed‚Äôs work are many of the 900 million people worldwide who rely on livestock for their livelihoods. History Originally GALVmed was known as the Global Alliance for Livestock Vaccines (GALV). GALV was founded in 2004. Earlier, in the early 2000s, scoping work under the DFID Animal Health Programme (AHP), identified the need for an organisation to promote the creation of a consortium to invest in research to produce livestock vaccines, diagnostics and other products for the control of tropical livestock diseases, which the private pharmaceutical sector was not funding at the time. As a result, the AHP went on to facilitate the establishment of GALV with an appropriate legal and institutional framework and its first business plan. It was envisaged that GALV would work in a similar way to the GAVI Alliance a similar organisation but with a human health agenda. The inception phase of GALV ran from October 2004 to March 2005. It was funded through a ¬£300,000 grant from DFID with the objective of establishing a global public- private partnership to develop new vaccines against diseases that inflict the livestock of poor people. Following the brief inception phase, DFID provided GALV (later GALVmed) with core and project funding totalling UK¬£5.6 million during the period April 2005 to November 2011. Of this total, ¬£3 million was joint funding in partnership with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF)for phase 1 of what is now known as the Global Alliance for Livestock Veterinary Medicines (GALVmed). This change of name reflected the recognition by GALV/GALVmed‚Äôs management and board that although vaccines were important, the development of other types of veterinary medicines, including drugs, would also be relevant in some cases. Together DFID and BMGF provided a total of ¬£20 million for phase 1, which was scheduled to run from September 2008 until August 2015. Throughout GALVmed phase 1, the organisation had as its mission statement and strapline \\"protecting livestock, saving human life\\" (PLSHL).Known as the PLSHL project, protecting livestock reflected the predominant focus on preventive veterinary medicines, especially vaccines, while saving human life indicated that two of the four key diseases GALVmed was targeting were zoonotic. The stated goal for phase 1 was to improve the health of livestock and increase food security and human health of poor livestock keepers in low-income countries. During phase 1, GALVmed focused on four key diseases: East Coast fever (ECF) that affects cattle, Rift Valley fever (RVF)that affects cattle, sheep, goats, camels and also people, porcine cysticercosis, that affects pigs and also people, and Newcastle disease, that affects poultry. For these diseases, GALVmed and partners aimed to identify suitable mechanisms for the development of control tools (vaccines, diagnostics and pharmaceuticals) and to facilitate their access and adoption. They also aimed to develop data-driven decision making tools and to communicate, network and support advocacy and global access strategy requirements of project delivery. The PLSHL project also comprised funding to assess existing vaccines and diagnostics on a further three diseases: contagious caprine pleuropneumonia (CCPP), that is a sheep and goat disease, contagious bovine pleuropneumonia(CBPP), that is a cattle disease and peste des petits ruminants (PPR), which is sheep and goat disease. In addition, exploratory activities were undertaken on African swine fever. By the end of phase 1, DFID reported that GALVmed and partners had made four vaccines available to poor livestock keepers. Two vaccines, one for the tick-borne cattle disease ECF and one emergency vaccine for the cattle, sheep and goat disease RVF, were reported to be already in wide use in Africa. In view of the progress made during GALVmed phase 1, DFID and BMGF decided to jointly fund GALVmed phase 2, scheduled to run from 2012 to 2017. For phase 2, DFID and BMGF jointly committed to providing over ¬£31.3 million (USD 51.5million)with DFID contributing 20 percent and BMGF 80 percent. Initially, phase 2 operated under the \\"protecting livestock, saving human life\\" mission and banner used for phase 1. In early 2014, this was amended to \\"protecting livestock, improving human lives\\" to reflect the increased emphasis on delivery and livelihoods. The focus for phase 2 was diseases that affect primarily the cattle, sheep, goats and chickens of poor farmers in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Specific diseases targeted were Newcastle disease, RVF, CBPP, ECF and CCPP. Furtherwork on porcine cysticercosis was funded exclusively by DFID as pig diseases were not a target for BMGF funding. In commenting on the awarding of the phase 2 grant, the UK International Development Secretary, Andrew Mitchell, explained that, ‚ÄúGALVmed has pioneered work to identify vaccines, medicine and early diagnostic solutions to tackle some of the most devastating livestock diseases that affect poor farmers in the developing world. This new funding from the British taxpayer and from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation will ensure that these innovative solutions are produced at scale and that solutions can get to those who need them most, at an affordable price.‚Äù As of 2014, GALVmed is one of only two British-based charities supported by the Gates Foundation. In August 2014, Bill Gates visited GALVmed‚Äôs Edinburgh office to see and hear first-hand the progress being made by GALVmed. Apart from the completed phase 1 and ongoing phase 2 PLSHL projects, GALVmed conceived and was a partner in the Vaccines for the Control of Neglected Animal Diseases in Africa (VACNADA) project, which ran from 2010 to 2011. The ‚Ç¨20million VACNADA project, funded by the European Union Food Facility and with overall coordination of the implementing partners by the African Union-Interafrican Bureau for Animal Resources (AU-IBAR), was an intervention aimed to enhance food security through reducing the impact of animal disease by increasing access to and use of quality vaccines. Other partners included the African Union Panafrican Veterinary Vaccine Centre (AU-PANVAC) and the centre de coop√©ration internationale enrechercheagronomique pour le d√©veloppement (CIRAD). GALVmed led the implementation of a VACNADA component to improve the capacity of eight African laboratories to make quality assured vaccines in more efficient ways that met internationally recognised quality standards and best practices. Staff from selected national vaccine producing laboratories, identified through a needs assessment, received training in laboratory and vaccine operation management, had their laboratory facilities upgraded and technical support provided for the implementation of quality assurance and standardisation of the production process of selected vaccines. In 2011, DFID awarded GALVmed an additional grant worth ¬£8,010,708 to support the development of an integrated package of tools and policies and implement it as a cost effective control of animal African trypanosomosis (AAT). The objective was to develop a new robust field diagnostic tool for AAT, new trypanocidal drugs and to establish the basis for the development of a vaccine for AAT. The Controlling AAT project was scheduled to run until February 2014,. The DFID funding for AAT was subsequently complemented by a grant worth US$ 1,421,722 awarded by BMGF in January 2014 to undergo Phase 2 of the project. The stated purpose of the BMGF grant was to develop safe and effective drugs against drug-resistant AAT as well as a diagnostic test for field diagnosis of infection in cattle and to improve the quality control of existing trypanocidal drugs used by smallholder livestock keepers in sub-Saharan Africa. GALVmed is also part of the consortium awarded US$ 1.8 million by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for the Contagious Bovine Pleuropneumonia BEN-1 Vaccine Evaluation project. The project is exploring the potential efficacy of a vaccine to combat contagious bovine pleuropneumonia which is a major constraint to cattle production in many areas of sub-Saharan Africa where 18 countries are reported to be affected by this disease. Organisation GALVmed is a company limited by guarantee and a registered charity in both Scotland, England and Wales. Its head office is located in Edinburgh, Scotland. GALVmed has regional offices in New Delhi and Nairobi, and project offices in South Africa and Botswana. GALVmed has 43 staff members and long-term consultants in addition to advisors and contracted consultants. It has more than 200 active partnerships. GALVmed is governed by a board made up of 11 trustees, recruited for their individual skills and experiences. The board provides strategic oversight and is in turn overseen by Members who are drawn from a wide range of public bodies, private institutions including pharmaceutical companies, and non-governmental organisations. Focus of work GALVmed is currently supporting activities in 15 African countries and also India and Nepal. In addition, product development activities are taking place in Europe, Asia, North & Latin America and Australia. GALVmed is currently working on 12 viral, bacterial and protozoal diseases that affect cattle, sheep and goats, pigs and poultry, some of which are zoonotic. The 12 diseases are: Cattle diseases: * East Coast fever (Theileriosis) * Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia * Trypanosomosis * Lumpy skin disease Sheep and goats diseases: * Peste des petits ruminants * Contagious caprinepleuropneumonia * Sheep & goat pox * Brucellosis Pigs diseases: * Porcine cysticercosis (zoonotic) * African swine fever Poultry diseases: * Newcastle disease Multi- species diseases: * Rift Valley fever (zoonotic) Twenty different veterinary products are currently being actively worked upon at various stages in the exploratory-proof of concept-development-registration-commercialization continuum: 11 vaccines, 4 pharmaceutical and 2 diagnostic products. Key projects Newcastle disease: One of GALVmed‚Äôs projects has focused on the prevention of Newcastle disease in the chickens kept by poor women in Nepal. GALVmed, in partnership with the NGO Heifer International Nepal, has established a vaccine supply system that has transformed backyard poultry keeping. Whereas previously these women regularly lost 90 percent of their small flocks to the disease, now, thanks to vaccination, they have built up profitable small-scale enterprises. These have not only enabled them to pay their children‚Äôs school fees and meet medical bills, but have also empowered the women who report that they now enjoy more respect from their husbands. Vaccination is carried out by trained community animal health workers who buy vaccines and offer vaccination services to the women on payment of a small fee. Following a recent assessment of the project, the BMGF concluded that, ‚ÄúThis is possibly the easiest, quickest and most economic way of reaching out to the poor of the world with visible results in helping alleviate poverty.‚Äù In 2015, GALVmed announced it was to bring Newcastle disease vaccination to 100,000 backyard poultry farmers in the Mayurbhanj district of Orissa, India. In partnership with Hester Biosciences Limited, GALVmed will use the thermostable Lasota vaccine for Newcastle disease. Although this vaccine needs to be transported and stored at 2-8 degrees Celsius, at village-level, it can be kept in room temperature for 10 days at 37 degrees Celsius. This means that the 237 local vaccinators will be able to stock up on the vaccine and not need to make frequent trips to the retailer for fresh stocks. East Coast fever: From the outset a major focus of GALVmed‚Äôs work has been ECF. GALVmed has invested heavily in providing infrastructure and business and technical support to the Centre for Tick and Tick Borne Diseases in Lilongwe, Malawi. In December 2014, CTTBD became the African Union centre of excellence in ECF vaccine production within Africa when it began production on the Muguga Cocktail vaccine against ECF. The one-shot-for-life vaccine will help protect 25 million cattle across 11 countries. The Muguga Cocktail ECF vaccine was originally developed by the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) and its predecessor, the International Laboratory for Research on Animal Diseases (ILRAD) and the Kenya Agricultural Research institute ‚Äì now known as the Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization (KALRO). Key partnerships Partnerships are central to GALVmed‚Äôs approach; it currently has 200 active partnerships.

Founding In January, 1850, David Sparks arrived at Port Natal on the ship, Ballengeich, after a voyage that had lasted the usual three to four months. He was then about 20 years old, very energetic, and determined to make his way in the new country. It was not long before he got to work. The pay was small but food was cheap and he managed very well. Young Mr and Mrs David Sparks settled in the area now known as Sydenham. A portion of Brickfields Estate had been bought by him from Joseph Cato, and here two wattle and daub rondawels were built with the kitchen ‚Äì a-lean-to-shelter ‚Äì away. Some years after the selling of the plots David Sparks built himself a seven-roomed brick house with a slate roof ‚Äì a home then thought to be one of the best and up-to-date in the Natal Colony. When the house was finished being built a housewarming party was held. People came from all parts of Natal, in carts, on horseback and ox-wagons to camp out in the grounds around the house. That huge picnic lasted a whole week, everyone being in the highest spirits, taking part in the games and dancing and feasting that marked the entertainment. The David Sparks's housewarming party was remembered for years. It was at this festival that Sydenham got its name. Old George Spearman suggested three names: Sparksville, Parkville and Sydenham. David Sparks chose the name Sydenham, and the homestead was called Sydenham House.THE SPARKS SETTLERS by David Gifford N.

The society is headquartered in Lalbagh, Bengaluru, in the south Indian state of Karnataka and its activities are spread in the districts of Bangalore Urban, Bangalore Rural, Kolar, Ramanagar, Mandya, Mysuru and Chikkaballapura. Overview The origin of HOPCOMS was in 1959 when Mari Gowda, the then director of the department of horticulture, founded the Bangalore Grape Growers‚Äô Marketing and Processing Co-operative Society for promoting grape farming by providing farming know how to the grape farmers and arranging a marketing set up for their products. The society had its operations in Bangalore, Kolar, Mysore, Tumkur, Mandya and Mangalore districts. A few years later, the society started dealing in other farm produces and re-branded itself as the Horticultural Producers‚Äô Co- operative Marketing and Processing Society in 1965, registering itself as a cooperative society. It comes under the jurisdiction of the department of horticulture, Government of Karnataka. The main activity of the society is the maintenance of a marketing system by which the farmers are ensured of a good price for their produces and the consumers are provided with quality goods at affordable prices. The society has eliminated the middle men and acts as the only link between the farmers and the consumers. As of March 2014, the society has a paid up capital of 26.59 million composed of Class A (farmers), Class B (NGOs, institutions) and Class C (government) shares and a member strength of 12,680 farmers. The organization is managed by a board of directors, reporting to the department of horticulture of the Government of Karnataka. Eleven of the 15 member board are elected from the farmers while the state government has three appointed officers and a nominee on the board. It employs 650 permanent staff and 790 temporary workers. The President is elected from the Class A members while the Managing Director is an appointee of the state government. Objectives * Dissemination of knowledge by way of training, technical advice and printed literature. * Supply of farm equipment, consumables such as manure and grafts. * Arranging storage facilities including cold storage. * Facilitating marketing of the produces through own marketing set up. * Direct supply of fruits and vegetables to factories, hospitals, hostels, clubs, social functions and processing industries. Activities The activities of HOPCOMS are threefold; procurement, storage and distribution. It has opened four procurement centres at Sarjapura, Channapatna, Hosakote and Kanakapura where facilities have been arranged for acceptance, weighment and grading of produces. The payment to the farmers are distributed immediately on acceptance of goods. The goods are then transferred to central godown, processing units or retail outlets as per requirement. The society runs 276 retail outlets of which 238 retail outlets in the urban and rural areas of Bengaluru and 19 outlets in Kolar district. HOPCOMS has fruit processing units which processes Grape, Mango and Orange juices for the retail market. It also has a distribution system for supplying fruits and vegetables to government hospitals such as Victoria Hospital, Leprosorium Hospital, Bowring & Lady Curzon Hospitals, NIMHANS and Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology, factories such as Indian Telephone Industries and Hindustan Machine Tools, hostels and clubs and also undertakes supply of produces for social and marriage functions. The total quantity of goods handled by HOPCOMS in a day is around 100 tonnes. It also supplies equipment, manure and consumables to the farmers at reduced rates and has plans to open a walk-in supermarket and 100 modern outlets with funding from the Karnataka Horticultural Federation. The society organizes periodic fruit and vegetable festivals in various places in Karnataka where special stalls are set up for direct selling of produces. HOPCOMs is also associated with other organizations dealing in fruits and vegetables such as National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (NAFED), Himachal Pradesh Horticultural Produce Marketing and Processing Corporation (HPMC), GROWREP, VEFCO and National Diary Development Board (NDDB). The society avails financial assistance from government and financial institutions for its developmental activities. It has collected grants from Zilla Parishads and the National Horticultural Board and a loan of 44.80 million from the National Cooperative Development Corporation of which 21.50 million has been paid back. However, it has been reported that the market presence of HOPCOMS has diminished over the years. The advent of retail outlet chains and reluctance of farmers to supply goods to the society has reportedly reduced the business volume from 34,000 tonnes of fruits and vegetables in 1997‚Äì98 to 20,726 tonnes during 2013‚Äì14.

It was developed by MBDA Missile Systems and is intended as a replacement for their MILAN, which has been sold worldwide.  Origins  The MMP programme originated in 2009 to develop a successor to MBDA's forty-year old MILAN. This was particularly in response to a French Urgent Operational Requirement of 2010 which had led to the purchase of the US-made Javelin, rather than MILAN; 260 Javelins were ordered because of its fire-and-forget capability, which also led to MBDA's improved MILAN-ER offering being rejected because it lacked such a feature.France receives missiles, launchers to replace Milan anti-tank system - Defensenews.com, 30 November 2017 The UK, previously a major user of MILAN, had also converted to Javelin. In 2011, the requirement set by the French Army called for a multipurpose precision strike capability to equip the front line units as well as special operation forces. The missile to be procured had to be able to destroy ground targets, fixed or moving, from light vehicles up to the latest generation MBTs, as well as personnel whether dismounted or protected behind fortifications. The firing officer had to be protected during the engagement thanks to ease of operation, fire and forget guidance and a capability to fire the missile from confined spaces. After competing against the Lockheed Martin/Raytheon Javelin and Rafael Spike, in December 2013 an order was placed by the French DGA to equip the French Army with the MMP as of 2017. Testing began in 2014, with warhead tests against MBT armour and then in April launches in a test tunnel to confirm missile safety for its launch crew. MMP was displayed at Eurosatory 2014. The first firing trial of MMP was carried out by DGA in its Bourges (central France) facilities on 3 February 2015, with the missile hitting a fixed target at a range of over 4,000 meters. The development programme had been funded privately by MBDA, and scheduled to be completed by 2017. On 29 November 2017, the DGA announced the delivery of a first batch of 20 firing posts and 50 MMP missiles after a successful operational evaluation firing campaign held by the French Army.[ https://www.defense.gouv.fr/dga/actualite-dga/2017/english/the-french-armed- forces-ministry-takes-delivery-of-its-first-mmps The first units will be used for training ahead of deployment in 2018. Initial plans are for the delivery of 400 firing posts and 1,750 missiles to French Army infantry and cavalry units and special forces of all branches by 2025, with options for further orders totaling 2,850 missiles. In addition to the MILAN and the Javelin, the MMP will also replace in the French Army the ERYX, and HOT missile mounted on the VAB Armored Fighting Vehicle as well as arm the EBRC Jaguar.  Description  The MMP was designed to overcome some of MILAN's limitations in the context of small-scale and counter-insurgency operations post-2000, rather than the Cold War tank war of the original MILAN requirement. In theatres such as Iraq and Afghanistan, man-portable missile were often used against strongpoints and improvised armour within populated areas. Reducing collateral damage to nearby civilians became a major political factor in such campaigns. Particular developments over existing missiles were for it to be safe for operators within a confined space, i.e. reduced backblast on launch, and for improved guidance that could target non-IR cold targets as well as AFVs with a reduced risk of collateral damage. Compared to its predecessors it contains a great deal of modern and COTS electronics, rather than the previously slow- moving development of military procurement. The missile and its guidance system offer three different operating modes:[4] * Fire-and-Forget * Man In The Loop with fibre optic data-link * Lock-on after launch (LOAL) for non- line-of-sight (NLOS) and using third party target designation. Despite these new features, it was still to remain effective against modern AFV and MBT armour. A tandem warhead is used, making it effective against conventional, composite and reactive armour. Upon detonation, the warhead also sprays 1,500 tungsten splinters, effective against personnel out to 15 meters. At commercial launch, MBDA introduced the MMP as the first land combat missile of 5th generation thanks to the following key features: * A dual-band seeker in both IR and visible low-light video, enabling the engagement of hot and cold targets in all visibility conditions.[4] The IR sensor is not cooled, which would restrict some performance for an anti-aircraft missile but is a major simplification for an infantry missile. In particular it avoids relying on a pressurized gas supply which would need to be replenished at depot level. Unlike some missiles, such as Stinger, with gas-cooled IR sensors or one-shot thermal batteries, MMP may be locked-on to potential targets repeatedly without consuming resources. These two sensors are mounted on a reversible axis in the dome, with the operator selecting which sensor mode to deploy before launch. In comparison with the classic side-by-side dual sensors, this arrangement provides a much wider field of view allowing the seeker to keep targets, especially fast moving ones, within the missile‚Äôs field of view thereby greatly easing after launch lock-on.¬∑ * Also dual mode, the firing post of the initial infantry version features a high resolution infrared cooled sensor and a daylight TV camera. These sensors high quality support all weather reconnaissance and threat evaluation functions. A fibre optics data link links from the missile presents the seeker images back to the firing station for Man In The Loop control. This also allows a launch to be aborted without detonation, should a collateral civilian suddenly obscure the target. For direct fires, the seeker is locked on before launch thanks to an automatic correlation with the firing post images, which secures and simplifies seeker lock on especially on targets at maximum range. This firing post also features a GPS receiver, a compass and an optional laser range finder which allows full netcentricity and exchange of target coordinates through tactical datalinks for third party target designation.¬∑ * The missile integrates an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), which is new in this class of light missiles, developed in MEMS (Micro Electro Mechanical Systems) Technology. Together with the fiber optics data link, this IMU allows in flight targeting and re- targeting for lock on after launch (LOAL) operations and also authorizes two selectable trajectory options: low altitude with direct attack or top attack for targeting main battle tanks (MBT) through their turret, which is their weakest point. * Weighing just over 2 kg, MMP's new 115 mm caliber multipurpose warhead features a tandem charge ‚Äì precursor charge positioned forward of the main rocket motor, main charge positioned behind the motor ‚Äì with two selectable modes, anti-armor -with the ability to penetrate over 1,000 mm of RHA (Rolled Homogenous Armour) under ERA (Explosive Reactive Armour)- and anti-infrastructure able to breach over 2 meters of armed concrete. Both modes feature an anti-personnel capability. * Lightweight, and easily man-portable. The missile measure 1,300 mm in length for a 140 mm caliber and the complete round weighs 15 kg including its tactical canister. The firing post weighs 11 kg, including its tripod and battery. The first missiles supplied are man-portable, but vehicle mounts are in development. * Safe firing from confined spaces, with reduced blast both behind and forward of the launcher. The missile may be launched with infantry in close proximity ahead. * Minimizing risk of collateral damage. The missile has a range of 4 km based on a French requirement, but in May 2018 two test firings were able to hit targets at 5 km.MBDA MMP missile sets a new range record to 5,000 meters . Army Recognition. 12 June 2018.  Evolution of the program  At Eurosatory 2016, MBDA also unveiled its new IMPACT turret. This 250 kg motorized turret was presented on a Dagger, a small armored vehicle produced by Renault Trucks Defense. It carries the day/night sensors of the MMP fire control, as well as two ready-to-fire missiles and a 7.62 mm machine gun and its ammunition for self-defense. In 2017, MBDA offered its MMP to the Australian Defence Force as an integrated ATGW on both the Rheinmetall Boxer (on the 30 mm Lance turret) and the BAE Systems AMV35 vehicles (on the 35 mm BAE H√§gglunds turret) under the Australian Army‚Äôs LAND 400 program. The missile is also being offered with its Infantry Firing Post for the Army‚Äôs LAND 4108 program, which is seeking a replacement to the in-service Javelin ATGW. At Eurosatory 2018, the French Army‚Äôs new Jaguar reconnaissance vehicle (developed by Nexter Systems, Arquus and Thales) was unveiled with a pod of two MMP integrated next to the turret. During the exhibition, MBDA and Milrem Robotics also announced the start of feasibility studies of an ‚Äúanti-tank unmanned ground vehicle‚Äù. The joint project integrates the Milrem Robotics THeMIS unmanned ground vehicle with the MBDA IMPACT (Integrated MMP Precision Attack Combat Turret) system fitted with two MMP. In August and September 2018, the French Army conducted a firing campaign in Djibouti in order to test the ability of the missile to operate in a desert environment. According to the government, nine MMP were successfully fired. Two of them were fired by the commandos from an ECUME rigid hulled inflatable boat (RHIB). The missiles were integrated in a stabilised and teleoperated turret, thus opening the way to a naval version of the MMP. In December, the Picardy Battle Group conducted an operation in the three-border region in the south-east of Mali, during which the new medium-range missile (Missile Moyenne Port√©e or MMP) MMP was deployed and used for the first time in a combat theatre. In early 2019, MBDA, the DGA and the STAT organised another firing campaign in order to test the performance of the MMP in cold conditions. They performed three successful firings in Sweden with temperature reaching -30 ¬∞C. Operators The French Army accepted the delivery of a first batch of 50 MMP missiles and 20 firing posts in November 2017. These first items will be used to train future users. The weapon system will be deployed in operations in the course of 2018 and the delivery of 400 firing posts and 1,950 missiles across all of the French Armed Forces by 2025 is already planned. In December 2017, Qatar reportedly opened negotiations with MBDA in order to acquire MMPs for up to 400 million euros. Most of Qatar current anti-tank missiles are to be dismantled and the country is looking to renew its stocks. Doha currently possesses around 650 missile -mostly HOT and old version of the Milan- that should be destroyed.  Current operators  * ‚Äì French Army: 400 launchers and 2,850 missiles to enter service from 2017.  Future Versions  In February 2017, MBDA announced the beginning of a joint venture (JV) with the Indian conglomerate Larsen & Toubro (L&T;). This JV Company will notably look to develop and supply fifth generation Anti-Tank Guided Missiles (ATGM5s), inspired by the MMP, in order to answer to a requirement of the Indian Army.

He was described as an ‚Äò‚Äôinventive neo-Jacobean and Scots Baronial designer‚Äô‚Äô. He exhibited works at the Royal Scottish Academy in the 1860s. He was also an inventor of a pyro-pneumatic grate: a heating system for churches. He self- financed several improvement schemes to the town of St AndrewsDictionary of Scottish Architects: John Milne Life He was born in Fettercairn in the north of Scotland, the son of a joiner and builder. He was apprenticed to John Henderson, an architect in Edinburgh, probably around 1838. He then transferred to the offices of David Bryce, probably around 1845, acting as Clerk of Works on Clatto House, near St Andrews. Milne settled in St Andrews and stayed there for the remainder of his life, operating from an office at 81 Market Street. At the time of the Disruption of the Church of Scotland, Milne ‚Äò‚Äôcame out‚Äô‚Äô and left the established church to join the Free Church of Scotland. Thereafter many of his commissions came from the Free Church. The majority of his works are within Fife other than a small handful in his native town of Fettercairn. In the mid 19th century he did several extension schemes for Leith Docks in combination with R & R Dickson.Buildings of Scotland: Edinburgh, by Gifford McWilliam and Walker He was an elected member of the Town Council in St Andrews and promoted several improvement schemes including extension of the Links Embankment and culverting of the old mill lade. When the council voted not to pay for the schemes he decided to pay for them himself. His project at the West Sands reclaimed twelve and a half acres of land for use as a public park. This was timed such as to be labelled as St Andrews Jubilee Scheme, marking Queen Victoria‚Äôs Golden Jubilee. Over and above designing buildings, Milne also designed the graves of two of his fellow Town Councillors in St Andrews: Provost John Paterson and Baillie Ireland. Both are in the New Cemetery in St Andrews (south-east of the cathedral). He also designed the Pagan monument in Leuchars churchyard. John Milne died in St Andrews in May 1904. Family He is thought to be the uncle or cousin of Robert Milne, architect, who died in Fettercairn in 1891.

The piece is dedicated to Emanuel Ax.Rouse, Christopher (1998). Seeing: Program Note by the Composer. Retrieved July 10, 2015. Composition The piece has a duration of roughly 28 minutes and is composed in four connected sections, similar to the form of a traditional concerto. Style and influences The composition freely quotes passages from Robert Schumann's Piano Concerto. Rouse wrote of this in the score program notes: The title of the piece comes from the song \\"Seeing\\" in the Moby Grape album Moby Grape '69. Rouse saw the album while browsing through his collection of rock music and \\"was struck by the combination of simplicity and vision symbolized by this title.\\" Rouse used this to extrapolate the conception of the work, later writing: As to whether the piece has any programmatic intent, Rouse specified: Instrumentation Seeing is scored for solo piano and an orchestra comprising three flutes, three oboes (3rd doubling English horn), three clarinets (3rd doubling bass clarinet), three bassoons, four French horns, three trumpets, three trombones, tuba, celesta, timpani, three percussionists, and strings.

A key moment for the company was the 2008 Olympic Games when its display products were used for the opening ceremony. It manufactured displays that illuminated the Olympic Rings and also supplied a display scroll that was 1300 sq. m of its ‚ÄúGround Bar‚Äù LED product, a LED display that could sustain physical activity over it including the moving wheels of a car. By 2014 the company had become focused on international expansion. At the time it injected HK $50 million (US $6.45 million) into its Hong Kong subsidiary, Leyard (Hong Kong), and invested RMB 50 million into another subsidiary, Beijing Leyard Electronics, with the stated objective of financing international expansion. Greater interest in international expansion went hand in hand with increasing overseas sales. In financial results disclosed in 2014, Leyard reported overseas orders had soared 85 percent year on year. Earlier in 2013 it had laid the groundwork for substantial international expansion when it entered into a joint venture agreement with MIC Electronics. Under the agreement, MIC Electronics would become the distributor of Leyard's products in India and once a certain amount of sales in India was reached, the companies would develop a factory in India. In November 2015, Leyard acquired Planar Systems, Inc. in Oregon, via its Leyard American Corporation subsidiary.

It is a successor to the WHOIS protocol, used to look up relevant registration data from such Internet resources as domain names, IP addresses, and autonomous system numbers. While WHOIS essentially retrieves free text, RDAP delivers data in a standard, machine-readable JSON format. In order to accomplish this goal, the output of all operative WHOIS servers was analyzed, taking a census of the labels they used. RDAP designers, many of whom are members of number or name registries, strove to keep the protocol as simple as possible, since complexity was considered one of the reasons why previous attempts, such as CRISP, failed. RDAP is based on RESTful web services, so that error codes, user identification, authentication, and access control can be delivered through HTTP. The biggest delay in getting RDAP done turned out to be the bootstrap, figuring out where the server is for each top level domain, IP range, or ASN range. IANA agreed to host the bootstrap information in suitable registries, and publish it at a well-known location URLs in JSON format. Those registries started empty and will be gradually populated as registrants of domains and address spaces provide RDAP server information to IANA. For number registries, ARIN set up a public RDAP service which also features a bootstrap URL, similar to what they do for WHOIS. For name registries, ICANN requires RDAP compliance since 2013. Number resources RDAP databases for assigned IP numbers are maintained by five Regional Internet registries. ARIN maintains a bootstrap database. Thanks to the standard document format, tasks such as, for example, getting the abuse team address of a given IP number can be accomplished in a fully automated manner. Name resources RDAP databases for registered names are maintained after ICANN agreement. Name resources are much slower, as the number of registries under ICANN is huge. In addition, as the GDPR became enforceable, in May 2018, the problem of personal data divulged via WHOIS or RDAP slowed adoption further.

ACT and Children's Hospices UK mergedTogether For Short Lives: 2294 Act children's hospices UK merge to become the single voice on 1 October 2011 to become one voice for children's palliative care in the UK. ACT (Association for Children with life-threatening and Terminal conditions) was established in 1988 under the direction of Professor David Baum, at the Institute of Child Health, Bristol and Sister Frances Dominica founder of Helen House hospice for children in Oxford. ACT was established to develop an information service for families and professionals supporting them; to develop a national network for children's palliative care and to co-ordinate statutory and voluntary services concerned with delivering palliative care to children and families. Children's Hospices UK (previously known as ACH) was established in 1998 as a national umbrella charity working with independent children's hospices across the UK. It was established to provide a national voice for children's hospices by raising awareness, improving statutory funding of hospices, and to foster collaboration between children's hospice services and to help develop professional practice. Both ACT and Children's Hospices UK were based in Bristol, UK and had a history of working collaboratively on awareness raising and lobbying, prior to merger in 2011. Membership and Services Together for Short Lives is an umbrella charity for services and professionals working across children's palliative care.

In December 2014 Together for Short Lives launched an animation called We‚Äôre Having a Baby to communicate the needs of families when they hear the news of their child's diagnosis and also to reassure families that there are specialist children's palliative care services to support them. The charity provides information and support to families and professionals working across children's palliative care. Together for Short Lives has developed a care pathway approach to delivering care and support to children and families and has published a series of resources to support this including a Core Care Pathway for Children with Life-limiting and Life-threatening Conditions and a Family Companion. Together for Short Lives‚Äô activity is informed by the needs of children and young people with palliative care need and their families, and by the experience of children's hospice and palliative care services. The charity has an established Parent Carer Advisory Group. In 2012 Together for Short Lives published a report called Square Table ‚Äì Local learning and evaluation report which captured the findings of a national listening tour of 42 'square table' events held across England, Scotland and Northern Ireland throughout 2011. More than 1,500 people took part in these events ‚Äì including families of children with life-limiting and life-threatening conditions, young people who have grown up using children's palliative care services, health, social care and education professionals and other representatives from across the community. They were designed to provide insight into the lives of children and their families as well as an opportunity to understand the perspective of a wide range of professionals who support them.

Paediatrics, Volume 129, Number 4, April 2012 http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/129/4/e923 shows that there are 49,000 children and young people with life-limiting and life-threatening conditions in the UK. In 2010, the Transition Partnership (a collaboration between Together for Short Lives, Hospice UK and the National Council for Palliative Care) working with researchers at the University of York was funded by the Big Lottery Research Programme to conduct the STEPP Project (supporting health transitions for young people with life-limiting conditions: researching evidence positive practice). The research was published in 2013. In 2013, Together for Short Lives published the BIG Study, a two-year research project undertaken with five university partners, funded by the Big Lottery Fund Research Programme. The Study explored how well the needs of life-limited children were being met in the West Midlands.

The station promotes Christian lifestyles, traditional Christian values, Gospel teachings and interdenominational Christian unity. From its outset, it has focused primarily on children, young people and family audiences. The station broadcasts a mix of locally made and overseas news and current affairs, documentaries, movies, children's programmes, teaching programmes, youth shows and music shows. Some of Shine's programmes cover the international work of Christian missions, while others include personal testimony. As of 2015, it features promotions and news updates produced and presented by Cathy Jenke, Luke Weston, Davina William, Peter Shaw, Diane Davenport and Brad Mills. Shine TV began broadcasting as Freedom TV in 1997, as a free-to-air UHF analogue TV channel in Christchurch. It relaunched as Shine TV in 2002, when it was added to Sky Television's digital platform. It expanded to Nelson on free-to-air UHF analogue in 2008, through a contract with local television channel Mainland TV. It was added to Freeview in 2010. Shine ceased broadcasting on its UHF frequencies in Christchurch and Nelson in 2013, when South Island analogue television was switched off. History Freedom TV (1997-2002) Shine TV began as Freedom TV, an independent local Christchurch station, in November 1997. It was based in the suburb of Burnside, and competed against two other local stations, Canterbury Television and NOW. The station broadcast mostly evangelical Christian programmes, and was sponsored by local evangelical churches and station director Warren Smith's Christian Superstore. In early United Christian Broadcasters (UCB), the international arm of Rhema Media, purchased 34 UHF spectrum television licenses from Television New Zealand, following the closure of Horizon Pacific and MTV New Zealand. The licenses covered all major cities and towns except for Gisborne and allowed the company to reach all households with a UHF reception. UCB never used the licenses, and sold them to sold to Australian television company Prime Television Limited for A$ 3.6 million in June 1998. Prime New Zealand was launched on the spectrum two months later. In 1999, Freedom TV met with United Christian Broadcasters, Alpha Video Trust and Dove Ministries, to discuss setting up a national broadcast centre in Auckland. The centre began operating in November 2000, with a studio, edit suites, film library, transmission control and production offices. It began producing programmes for Freedom TV in March 2001 to prepare the station for a nationwide launch. Shine TV relaunch (2002) In June 2002 Freedom TV signed a contract to provide a 24-hour Christian channel for Sky Television's digital platform, after deciding a nationwide UHF or UHF or VHF television station would be prohibitively expensive to set up. In August it transferred its Christchurch and Auckland operations to Shine TV, a new wholly owned subsidiary of the Rhema Media. This significantly increased Rhema's costs and staffing needs. On 1 December 2002 Freedom TV officially became Shine TV, and began nationwide broadcasting on Sky. The channel was available to all Sky subscribers, and was part of a \\"Shine TV package\\" that locked adult material. The station's new name reflected two Biblical metaphors: * Isaiah 60:1: \\"Arise and shine for your light has come and the Glory of the Lord is risen upon you. For behold the darkness shall cover the earth, and deep darkness the people: but the Lord will rise over you, and His Glory shall be seen upon you.\\" * Matthew 5:13-16: \\"You are the worlds seasoning to make it tolerable. If you lose your flavour what will happen to the world? And you yourselves will be thrown out and trampled underfoot as worthless. You are the World's light - a city on a hill, glowing in the night for all to see. Don't hide your light! Let it shine for all; let your good deeds glow for all to see, so that they will praise your heavenly Father.\\" Shine TV (2002-) Shine was promoted with a nationwide tour, and a billboard outside the Rhema Media building near Auckland's Southern Motorway. In 2006, Shine TV became one of the first New Zealand broadcasters to provide on-demand videos, before most New Zealanders even had access to broadband internet. In 2009, it still provided one of the few New Zealand on-demand services. Shine TV launched on Freeview on 1 April 2010. In June 2011, some Sky customers questioned why Shine TV was included in the basic package while other channels were being removed. Shine TV continued to broadcast on free-to-air analogue in Christchurch through a contract with Freedom TV's original owner, New Zealand Television Ministries Trust until 2013. The lease covered Freedom TV's Christchurch facility, UHF broadcast license, transmission site and equipment. Shine TV Christchurch continued to broadcast local notices and advertisements, but was criticised for removing local programmes after other local stations like Canterbury Television and NOW had done the same. Shine also expanded to Nelson on free-to-air analogue channel 44 on 11 November 2008, through a similar contract with local television channel Mainland TV. Both frequencies were switched off by the Government on 28 April 2013. Programmes Nzone Rhema Media operated a dedicated news department between 2004 and 2014. From 2004-2007 it began producing two flagship television current affairs programmes - 'Nzone' on Tuesday nights [hosted by Tim Sisarich] and 'Nzone Focus' on Thursday nights [hosted by Bob McCoskrie], which was a longer-form current affairs programme. Both programmes were produced by former TVNZ staffer, Pene Thomas. In 2007 The arrival of former Newstalk ZB and BBC radio journalist Allan Lee. enabled the department to progress the programme to a nightly 'live' news programme, Mondays to Fridays. 'Nzone Tonight' was presented by Rachel Thomas or Asher Bastion, with sports segments from Andrew Curtis or Brooke Dobson. Executive Producer was Allan Lee with Pene Thomas [now Ashby] Producer. Rhema staff members filed reports, and other sources were provided by Newstalk ZB, UCB UK and Voice of America. In 2009, 'Nzone' reverted to being a weekly format, more like the original 'Nzone' and was presented by interviewers Davina William and Allan Lee, with reports from other members of the Rhema News team. That format continued until its cancellation in 2014. Other programmes Shine TV's weekday line-up includes Christian children's puppet show What's In The Bible, Christian anime show Superbook and Christian World News bulletins. The channel broadcasts a range of Christian teaching programmes, including Destined to Reign with Joseph Prince, Answers with Bayless Conley, Harvest Life with Greg Laurie, Enjoying Everyday Life with Joyce Meyer, In Touch with Dr. Charles Stanley and Lakewood Church with Joel Osteen. The station has received media attention for some of its shows. In 2013, New Zealand Herald columnist Paul Casserly said nightly Christian talk show The 700 Club was a \\"firm favourite as late-night stoner viewing\\" before the launch of Comedy Central New Zealand and video streaming websites. In 2015, Fairfax New Zealand reviewer Trevor Agnew described the message of Shine TV as \\"the end times are here\\". Shine broadcasts a range of Christian music videos, including 30 minutes of worship music videos sponsored by the Rhema radio network every afternoon. Contemporary gospel artist Debbie Shepherd has performed live on-air. A Christchurch boy with Kartagener syndrome met guitarist Brian Welch after first being introduced to his music on Shine TV.

Each of the four did the best he could in his specialty of either cross country, jumping, downhill or slalom. A four event skier was the rare athlete that could place high in all four disciplines. Thus was born the Ski Meister Skier. 1963 Discovering Mount Van Hoevenberg After leaving the U.S. Team, Wilson returned to Lake Placid and the family business. He volunteered coaching high school kids throughout the Adirondacks. He was eager to get coaches and skiers tuned into a great way of life. He was also analyzing potential locations in the Lake Placid area to establish a U.S., Oslo style \\"Holmenkol\\". But the time was not right. He predicted at the time it would be at least ten years before there would be enough interest in the U.S. to support such an idea! Consequently, he was more than mildly surprised when he was contacted by the head of the New York State. Forest Rangers, Mr. William Petty, to research the Mount Van Hoevenberg area, with the idea in mind of creating cross country trails in a park type atmosphere. Since the bobsled run was already there, they had substantial land holdings there. Wilson had developed a reputation in his late teens for his knowledge of the woods, his logging abilities, road building capabilities, and knowledge of heavy equipment. He eagerly took to the job. He spent two months tramping, judging, and recording his notes. His only concern at the time was if there would be adequate elevation change to comply with international rules. Subsequent land purchases solved that problem. As a result of the efforts required to hold the 1980 Olympics it became next to Holmenkollen, the premier cross country ski center in the world. U.S. Army From 1959 to 1963, Wilson was a lieutenant in the United States Army. He was assigned to the U.S. Biathlon Team Training at Fort Richardson, in Anchorage, Alaska. He spent his entire four-year service career competing in cross- country and in Biathlon for the U.S. in Europe and with the U.S. Army Marksmanship Team. Upon arrival at Fort Richardson, Wilson was shocked to discover there were absolutely no training facilities available for Biathlon. No trails, and most importantly, no shooting range. There were few people who knew what biathlon entailed. He convinced the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to deliver a new caterpillar D-8. Wilson and his two teammates, Dick Taylor and Peter Lahdenpera, former college racing competitors, and the only three skiers representing the entire Nordic/biathlon team at the time, built a complex biathlon shooting range which was used for the next 12 years, until the U.S. Army stopped financing the U.S. Biathlon effort. Olympic Pre-Trials In 1959 Wilson placed first in the Olympic pre-trials in the 15k, also known as the North American Nordic championships-Squaw Valley.http://thetahoeweekly.com/2014/01/joe-pete-wilson-tahoe-olympian-cross- country-skiing-pioneer-2/ This placing set Joe Pete up as a major U.S. skier due to the number of U.S. and foreign competitors in the race. International Olympic Committee Rules require that a major International Competition be held in all events prior to an Olympic Competition, usually scheduled one year prior as a trial run to test the complex systems involved. Nordic skiing is the poor cousin of Alpine (Downhill) skiing, which is so popular in the U.S. The individual disciplines involved in the Nordics are cross-country ski racing, ski jumping, combined cross-country and jumping, biathlon- cross- country skiing, and rifle marksmanship! 1960 US Olympic Team Wilson was a member of the U.S. Nordic Ski Team Competing in Squaw Valley, California in 1960. He skied the 30K. Finishing 43rd, the reverse of the number on his racing bib. He later commented he somehow ended up with the wrong bib! Based on his results in the pre-Olympics, on the same courses in 1959, he should have placed much higher. Racing in Europe In 1961 and 1962, Wilson was on the U.S. Team racing in Europe, including Scandinavia, in cross-country and in biathlon. In 1962 he finished tenth in Falun, Sweden: in their National Championships among 900 competitors, a significant placing for an American at that time. Still impressive even today. This would be the equivalent to what is referred to today as a World Cup. His two teammates also had impressive performances. These placings remain the highest ever posted by a U.S. Skier to this day. 1964 North American Snowshoe Champion Having just recently left the U.S. Ski Team, Wilson was ready for a little testing. The North American Snowshoe Championships sponsored by the Saranac Lake Chamber of Commerce as part of their famous Winter Carnival, which was first introduced in 1897, seemed to be the perfect place to test the water ‚Äì in its fluffy form. Wilson was new to the sport, but not to competition. After the race he remarked that it certainly had been a pleasant day. 1965 Bronze Medalist in the Bobsled World Championship St. Moritz, Switzerland Wilson came to the sport of bobsled wet behind the ears so to speak. It developed eventually that he possessed an innate love of ice. Once when asked what makes a good bobsledder he answered, \\"You have to love ice, and not just in your drinks\\". This fascination combined with his competitive spirit and drive made his work easy. At one point he was the brakeman for the U.S. two man team and the #1 four man team in Europe. He somehow missed the 1964 Olympic Bobsled Team, where his former two ski team pals were competing in Insbruck, Austria, for the U.S. Ski Team. A fact he says that popped into his head from time to time that he regrets! Had fate played a different role Wilson could have been on three Olympic teams in three different sports. His national rankings in Polo and Auto Racing added to the mystique. 1967-1968 Treasurer Vermont Ski Areas Association Wilson was elected treasurer of the Vermont Ski Areas Association. During the formative years of Alpine skiing and the major growth of Big Alpine ski areas across the U.S., Vermont was the recognized leader in ski area development. Numerous innovations to ski area development, and the sport itself were pioneered in Vermont. It was in this environment that Wilson found himself from 1966 to 1969 as general manager of Burke Mountain, in East Burke, Vermont, just north of St. Johnsbury. Getting to know these people was fun, exciting, and highly educational, especially in the area of ski operation and management. Being elected treasurer of the ski areas association and controlling all that money wasn't bad either, but the opposite swing of the pendulum for Wilson. Burke Mountain Academy During the 1966 to 1969 period \\"Burke\\" was a small ski area in East Burke, Vermont. Under Wilson's management the facility was expanded, including the trails and base Lodge, where a bar and dining room were added. Several farmhouses were completely remodeled. Several condos, townhouses, and a vacation home were built. A complete sewage system was designed and built. Wilson staffed it with many young, enthusiastic people with skiing backgrounds, typical of the day. As a result of his real estate background, Wilson realized the future sales value of the land surrounding this Monadnock type mountain and the views it offered. Wilson also knew that along with ownership came the right to control the design and atmosphere of whatever was done in the future. Wilson put together a 4,000 acre land package on the north facing side, which also controlled lands on the east and west sides of the mountain. In the continual effort to increase business at Burke, Wilson realized he had a lot of mountain and a lot of lift capacity, especially mid-week. He was aware of the experiments with ski sports academies at Stratton and Stowe. He decided it was worth a try. He made the proposal to his board and the Burke Mountain Academy was born. 1970 Complete Cross-Country Skiing and Ski Touring  Co-authored \\"Complete Cross-Country Skiing and Ski Touring\\" with William J. Lederer. Many believe this book is responsible for starting the boom in cross-country skiing in the United States in the 1970s. To this day, Wilson does not know what initially brought Lederer to Burke. However, through a fairy tale series of events, a lasting friendship and a great book were the outcome. Many say this was typical of Wilson's career. William J. Lederer was co-author with Eugene Burdick of one of the most well-known books in US history, \\"The Ugly American\\". Lederer was among the most prolific writers of the time. He had several other bestsellers. What did Lederer know about skiing, nothing, but Lederer knew how to write; Wilson knew how to ski, and could easily break down the principles of skiing techniques. They collaborated on the writing. 1971 Glen Ellen He became director of advertising and public relations and manager of real estate sales at the Glen Ellen ski area in Vermont. Again, his love of skiing and knowledge of the sport combined with past work experiences aided him greatly. Most noteworthy was his ability to listen to and field questions. With his broad and extensive experiences he had plenty of resources to draw upon. 1971-72 Cooke City  Barely noticeable, hidden in the very north western corner of Montana is a wide spot in the road called Cooke City. Many people have passed through never realizing there is no charge for parking! It is only a few miles from the north east entrance to Yellowstone. In 1971 & 1972 Wilson conducted an extensive Nordic summer ski camp here. With support from the well known ski sports writer John Hitchcock, Cooke City proved to be an ideal location. The mountains in this area provide one exciting view after another. The skiing occurred at 11,000\\" to 13,000\\". The days were divided between short, scenic tours with substantial instruction and distance tours to the famous Grasshopper Glacier, where on hot summer days the glacier relaxed its hold on thousands of grasshoppers. Initially, millions had eaten the ground bare in the mid-west but had been driven off the plains in a violent windstorm, then caught in a freak Fall snowstorm here in the bitterroots. With endless sunny days and snow everywhere the days offered up rare experiences. 1972 Trapp Family Lodge Wilson set up the cross-country ski operation at the Trapp Family Lodge in Stowe, Vermont. Recognized as the first commercial cross country ski area in the U.S. Summing up all his experiences to that point, his alpine ski shop experiences as a kid in Lake Placid, traveling and racing in Europe and Scandinavia, writing the cross country ski book, counseling ski and hiking clubs planning ski treks, Wilson put together a cohesive plan for this new operation. He had a feeling even then that this could become a showcase. But he was plowing new ground. There were no examples to follow. There were no cross-country ski centers in operation in the U.S. or Canada at that time. This would be a first. It would be an experiment! For Wilson, there was a lot riding on it. This format became the standard for cross-country operations across the United States for years to come. The Trapp Family Lodge Ski Center operates much the same today as when Joe Pete originally set it up.http://thetahoeweekly.com/2014/01/joe-pete-wilson-tahoe-olympian-cross- country-skiing-pioneer-2/ > To Whom it May Concern: It is a privilege to put forth a personal > recommendation for my distinguished friend and colleague Joe Pete Wilson, > who has been an esteemed business associate for nearly three decades.

Sincerely, > Charlie Yerrick > (Nordic Director, Trapp Family Lodge, Retired) 1972 CCSAA Wilson could see that cross-country skiing was coming on. He realized there was little knowledge or information available to the general public in the United States about cross-country skiing. He decided an organization of area operators could exchange ideas, disseminate information, set standards, and assist insurance companies in the area of risk management. After a successful start and a couple of name changes, a strong and effective national organization emerged called the Cross-Country Ski Area Association (CCSAA) which is now an international organization including Canada and is headquartered in Winchester, New Hampshire. 1973 North American Nordic He established a company called North American Nordic (N.A.N). He picked fifteen of the best locations in the Northeastern United States, that he could find, that he thought would make good cross-country ski operations. It was a combination of golf courses in urban areas and Country Inns in mountainous locations covering seven states. He groomed trails in all locations. This was a first for cross-country ski areas. The concept of a franchise type operation and the grooming of trails were a radical step in the right direction for cross-country skiing at the time. It ceased operations upon the death of his friend John Greene, also an elite skier who was from Auburn, Maine. 1974 P.S.I.A. At a point Wilson realized a cohesive teaching system for cross- country was imperative. He brought together a small group of people working in the sport who were involved with major cross-country ski areas. A solid teaching system evolved, which was universally accepted and known today as P.S.I.A. Wilson was honored by a lifetime achievement membership in P.S.I.A. He is now serving in his fortieth year.

Wilson was chosen for the job. He spent three weeks lecturing in Norway, Sweden, and Finland. His secondary assignment was to test aquavite. Wilson was up for the task. He was familiar with the customs and the people in all three of the countries due to his racing experiences. His knowledge, wit, sensitivities, and patience aided him greatly. The experiment was a success. 1977-1978 United States Biathlon Team Wilson was named coach of the US Biathlon team. Wilson was recommended for the job based on his racing career and his extensive coaching experience. His resume included his highly successful book plus his guidance in producing the PSIA instructors manual. His knowledge of Kentucky windage and his extensive training in rifle marksmanship by the famous M.Sgt Marvin Fitzpatrick of the U.S. army rifle team also helped. In 1978-79, the US Biathlon Team had significant success at the World Championships held in Lake Placid prior to the 1980 Olympics. Among other things, he was given a signed poster for his efforts, with the inscription 'Your incomparable enthusiasm continues'. 1979-1980 Olympic Venue Manager Wilson was the venue manager for the bobsled and Luge events at the 1980 Lake Placid Olympics. He directed a staff of 4,000 employees and volunteers. 1981 Bark Eater Wilson took control of the family inn business known as the Bark Eater in Keene, New York. Bark Eater is the English translation of the Indian word Adirondack. Due to business regulations at the time the Bark Eater Inn and Silver Saddle Riding Stable operated as DBA's, under Indian Meadows Farms, the corporate name. Wilson built a polo field, an ingenious trick on an Adirondack hillside farm. The riding stable grew to a total of eighty-five horses. 1981 Bark Eater X-C Trail System Utilizing old cow paths and logging trails, and the rolling terrain and hills nearby on the 250 acres he owned, Wilson designed and personally constructed a trail system that people drove for miles to try. From growing up in the earth-moving and logging business as a child, he was a skilled heavy equipment operator. The key Wilson says, is to not be too heavy. \\"When it comes to uphill and downhill, you can't fool an old dairy cow!\\" The trail system had several rest stops and overlooks. There were no challenging ascents nor precipitous descents preventing anyone's access. 1983 World Masters He was chosen as the Chief of Race for the World Masters skiing competition at Mount Van Hoevenberg in Lake Placid. This event attracted 1000 competitors. An overwhelming number at that time. This time Lake Placid had snow and many experienced volunteers. 1984 Nordic Alliance Nordic Skiing hit a major slump. There was major concern and no clear cut answers. Wilson got some of his merry band together to try to get answers. There were some positive results. The major problems were defined, thus directing all future energy in the right direction. More time would have made a significant impact on the sport. Wilson had been carrying the administrative and financial duties but was finally forced to direct all his energies and resources to his business. 1985 Country Inns and Back Roads The Bark Eater Inn was invited to join \\"country inns and back roads\\", considered by many as a list of the top 200 country inns in the United States. 1986 Ski Magazine A story in \\"Ski Magazine\\" called Wilson \\"an iconoclast before his time.\\" 1986 Ski Inns Book \\"Cross-Country Ski Inns of the Northeastern United States and Canada\\" Based on the idea of a simple concept. Wilson was asked to put together a unique coffee-table book combining country inns and cross-country ski centers, often referred to as the \\"Ski Inns Book\\". He put together a financial plan, contacted the ski inns, and personally visited each to check qualifications and facilities. The result was a successful, classy coffee-table book. 1991 Second Ski Inns Book \\"Cross-Country Ski Inns of the Northeastern US and Quebec\\" The success and sales of the first ski inns book led to the publication of a second, referred to as the second edition which included some minor changes and some new inns. It too was popular and in fact today there are no books left of either publication. For a time Wilson had one copy of each edition, but now there is question if there are any, except in private collections. 2000 Ski Trax Magazine Wilson was named one of the top ten people who have done the most to promote the growth of cross-country skiing in the United States in the last century. 2001 Lake Placid Hall of Fame Wilson was inducted into the Lake Placid Hall of Fame. 2011 St. Lawrence Hall of Fame Wilson was inducted into the St. Lawrence University Hall of Fame. 2013 The Nordic Concept Many people are unsure of the meaning of the various terms used in skiing. When the term Alpine is used, some people are immediately aware of the different disciplines that the term signifies. This is not the case with the term Nordic. Also, now the Nordic discipline of biathlon is becoming popular, adding more confusion. After considerable thought, Wilson has decided what is really needed is a universal symbol - a trademark representative of or depicting all four disciplines (Cross Country, Jumping, Combined, Biathlon). In this respect, there are a myriad of hurdles to consider. But progress is being made. There are numerous ways to encourage greater use of the word Nordic. One simple way is to create a patch depicting the Nordic disciplines or a Nordic setting. One design for a distinctive patch has been completed and is part way through production. Other ideas such as pins, etc. are being explored. Production designs on those will start right away. Wilson has also launched a grassroots campaign to use the term \\"Nordic\\" more in conversation, writing, in print and signage. 2014 The New Ski Although snowshoeing is a great recreational sport, many people find the snowshoe a difficult, frustrating challenge. Many attempts, some with great research and monetary expense have been made to develop a better design. Wilson has designed what he calls a snowshoe that slides. It has a slight side cut. The tip is slightly wider than the midpoint and the tail is slightly more narrow than the tip, but still wider than the midpoint. It functions best when used with a three pin OB binding and a rugged boot, like the Fisher OB3. It has a no wax base and a slight reverse camber (rocker). He has designed a second ski, a skate/touring concept and is working on its development and production. 2014 Founders Award Wilson was honored with a Founders Award by Chris Frado, Executive Director and President of CCSAA for his work and dedication to the sport of cross-country skiing and the CCSAA. 2015 Rumors of Lake Placid making a bid for a future Olympics have begun to circulate. Wilson is combining his knowledge of the area and his past Olympic experiences to draft a cohesive, workable plan the Lake Placid area can submit that will adequately utilize everything Lake Placid and the surrounding area have to offer and to enhance the chances of being awarded the bid! With only slight changes to traditional procedures a solid plan can be developed. As always, there will be naysayers and reluctance on the part of some to cooperate. However, Wilson's philosophy is that time and thought solve all problems. Wilson feels In order to make a successful bid for the next Winter Olympics, the U.S. will have to join forces with Canada. This will open up access and more potential venues, and ease financial burdens for only one country. Personal life Joe Pete Wilson resided outside Lake Placid, NY; near the Saranac Lake area, home to 3 new Nordic Olympians, one winning Gold.

It was once the seat of the Glynn family and later the seat of Sir Hussey Vivian. History There has been a property in this location next to the River Fowey since before the Norman Conquest. It was later owned by Ralph de Monthermer, 1st Baron Monthermer who married Edward I's daughter Joan of Acre, and subsequently by Henry V. The Glynn family first occupied the estate in the mid-15th century. The present house was built in the mid to late 18th century on the site of an earlier one. In 1805, it was rebuilt and refronted by Edmund John Glynn, High Sheriff of Cornwall, which included two Palladian wings. It was damaged in a fire in 1819 and restored. In 1833, it was refurbished for Richard Hussey Vivian, which included the addition of a portico with four Doric order columns. Further alterations took place in the 20th century. During World War II, the house was used as a secret naval base. The estate was sold in 1947. The estate was Grade II listed on 15 June 1951. The grounds include a old oak tree dating from the 19th century. Research The house has been the home of Glynn Research Ltd, founded by Nobel Prize winning biologist Peter D. Mitchell and Jennifer Moyle, who co-founded to a charitable research company known as Glynn Research Ltd. They began working together between 1948 and 1952. Mitchell acquired Glynn House in 1964, and founded Glynn Research there, to promote biological research. In 2019, the house was put on the market, with a guide price of around ¬£3.5 million.

Life and creative work He was learning art and languages in Germany before he moved in Louisville in 1908. In Europe Weygold became interested in American Indians, learning the Lakota language and Native American culture. This experience was of great help to him later to advise to European museum directors. In 1909, Weygold went to the Pine Ridge and Rosebud Reservations in South Dakota, where he obtained Native American artifacts for the Museum of Ethnology in Hamburg. He also made a lot of photographs to reflect Native American life and culture. In his photographs he also reserved the first evidence of the Plains Indian sign language. Later he was able to use his ethnographic experience to illustrate two books by the Dakota author Charles Eastman and two others by James Willard Schultz for a German publisher. Weygold gathered a personal collection of Native American artifacts and he later presented it to the Speed Art Museum, which now approves to be the main part of the museum's collection.Picturing American Indian Cultures‚Äô: The Art of Kentucky‚Äôs Frederick Weygold Retrieved on 13 Mar 2018 PICTURING AMERICAN INDIAN CULTURES: THE ART OF KENTUCKY‚ÄôS FREDERICK WEYGOLD Retrieved on 13 Mar 2018 During a long period, Native American artifacts were far more popular in Europe ‚Äî where Weygold did much of his work ‚Äî than in the United States.

DK find out Elaborate patterns including dots, checks, and waves were used with colors from various dyes including cochineal, sulfate of iron, sulfate of copper and sulfate of antimony were used.

They were made of gold and precious gems such as rubies, diamonds, emeralds and sapphire.  Women's fashion   Beauty routine  Women of the imperial court practiced an elaborate beauty ritual consisting of the 16 celebrated rituals. Eyebrows were arched symmetrically, Kajal applied to eyelids, the teeth were blackened with missi. Nath worn on the nose, studded with diamonds, was usually gifted to a bride by her husband. Betel leaf was used to redden the lips, sweeten breath and as deodorant. Princesses always decorated hands and feet red with mehendi, despite the obscene cost as it was also used as a remedy for skin irritations. Idealized Portrait of the Mughal Empress Nur Jahan (1577-1645)? LACMA M.81.271.7  Jewellery  The Mughal period was one of the most popular eras of jewelry making, which is well-documented through chronicles and paintings. In fact the earlier Mughal paintings indicate that the era of Akbar's reign gave anew life into the art, crafting a range of exotic designs. The Mughals contributed in almost all fields of development of jewelry. The use of jewelry was an integral part of the lifestyle, be it the king, men or women or even the king's horse. Women were known to have as many as 8 complete sets of jewelry. Popular ornaments included two-inch-wide armlets worn above the elbows, bracelets or pearls at the wrist stacked high enough to impede access to the pulse, many rings (with the mirror ring worn on the right thumb customary for nearly all the inhabitants of the Zenana), strings of pearls (as many as 15 strings at a time), metal bands or strings of pearls at the bottom of their legs, and ornaments hanging in the middle of the head in the shape of star, sun, moon, or a flower. Turban jewelry was considered a privilege of the Emperor. The constant change in the influences from Europe can be clearly witnessed in the design of the turban jewelry. Akbar stuck to Iranian trends of the time by keeping a feather plume upright at the very front of the turban. Jahangir initiated his own softer style with the weighed down plume with a large pearl. By the time of Aurangzeb, this form became more ubiquitous. Turbans were usually heavily set with jewels and fixed firmly with a gem set kalangi or aigrette. Some of the popular head ornaments worn by men were Jigha and Sarpatti, Sarpech, Kalgi, Mukut, Turra and Kalangi. Women also adorned a variety of head ornaments such as Binduli, Kotbiladar, Sekra, Siphul, Tikka and Jhumar. In addition to these, the braid ornaments constituted an important part of women's head ornaments. Ear ornaments were also quite popular during the Mughal times. Mughal paintings have represented earrings quite often. Ear ornaments were worn by both men and women. Mor- Bhanwar, Bali, Jhumkas, Kanphool and Pipal patra or papal patti are some of the known earrings from the period. Neck ornaments of different kinds of pearls and precious stones were worn by men and women. Some of the neck ornaments for men included Latkan, amala necklace as well as Mala. Neck ornaments formed an important part of jewelry of women also and included Guluband, Hans, Har and Hasuli. Nose ornaments were worn solely by women. It appears that nose ornaments appeared in India around the last part of the 16th century initiated by Mughals. The variety of nose ornaments worn by women during the Mughal times constituted phul, besar, laung, balu, nath and Phuli.  Dress  Owing to the relative isolation of the ladies in court, due to the Purdah, fashion in the early days of the empire adhered to traditional dress of Khurasan and Persia. In time, the social and diplomatic relationships between the Mughal Dynasty and the rest of India (Rajputana in particular), led to more exchange in accoutrements. Noble women in the court of Babur or Humayun would have begun their outfits with wide loose pants, painted or stripped. Their upper body was covered in loose garments fastened at the neck or with \\"V\\"-shaped necklines. Other articles of clothing included the Yalek: a tightly fitting nearly floor length vest, buttoned in the front, with the chest accentuated, in both short and long sleeve varieties. With the addition of Rajput princesses during the reign of Akbar, Hindu clothing came to influence the court. The wives and consorts began to dress similarly, regardless of religion. Often the ladies wore multiple layers of clothing, with a tight fitting bodice that stopped short of the navel. The peshwaz, fashionable as a men's garment for a time and later adopted by the women, was added on top. The length hit the knees or lower, the waist fastened closely, and the neckline was in a \\"V\\" shape. The opening at the front of the peshwaz would have been decorated in gold. Their lower half were covered either in tight pants (tunban or izar), or in la hengu, which itself was styled like a lungi attached at the ends and a band sewn into the top. Muslim women favored the pants style, and Hindu women, the skirt. In either style, the drawstrings were decorated at length with pearls and jewels. Only the costliest clothes of cotton, silk or wool were used. In the zenana, there were multiple costume changes a day, and often an outfit would be worn only once and then given away. The garments themselves were very thin, weighing less than an ounce each, with gold lace added and ‚Äúmuslin so fine as to be almost transparent.‚Äù This may account for the breasts occasionally seen in Mughal miniature painting. The head was covered with gold cloths or turbans with feathers. Long gowns (qaba) or kashmiri shawl were used in cold weather. Jamawars were suits of wool with flowers interwoven with wool or silk. Patterned and bejeweled shoes, with distinctively sharp upward curling points and worn down heels were fashionable.  Textiles  Fabrics of the time included wild goat‚Äôs hair cloth (tus) and pashmina, light and warm wool. Silks were often embroidered with gold and silver thread and embellished with laces. Any and all of these cloths were regularly scented with rose water. Shawls were reportedly so thin they could pass through a finger ring. The various muslins had poetic names like ab-i-rawan, meaning \\"running water\\", and daft hawa, meaning \\"woven air\\". Each garment would wear out after a single use.

Description UK in a Changing Europe is an independent research organisation created to communicate academic research on the UK's relationship with the European Union. The initiative is funded by the Economic and Social Science Research Council, which is part of UK Research and Innovation (UKRI). UK in a Changing Europe is led by Director Anand Menon, Professor of European Politics and Foreign Affairs at King's College London. Its Deputy Director is Professor Tim Bale, and the Senior Research Fellow is Jill Rutter. The organisation consists of nine Senior Fellows from across the UK, appointed in June 2019 to support the initiative. The primary objective is to disseminate academic research in an accessible format to inform public and political debates on the UK's place in the EU. The first round of fellows concluded in January 2015. Funded academics are expected to work on projects to make their work accessible to the public, through activities such as blog posts and public events. At the 2017 Think Tank of the Year Awards, The UK in a Changing Europe won the \\"one to watch\\" category, in 2018 it won the \\"best UK international think tank category\\"Magazine 2018 Winners\\", and in 2019 it won the \\"foreign affairs\\" categoryMagazine 2019 Winners\\". The initiative hosts regular events, open to the public, on a range of policy issues relating to UK-EU relations, including on Brexit and Trade, Brexit and Parliament, Brexit and the Island of Ireland, Brexit and the Media, Brexit and the Constitution, Brexit and Public Opinion. The initiative also hosts an annual conference. Research In April 2016, the group published a report (in collaboration with Full Fact) titled \\"Leave/Remain: The Facts behind the claims\\" which fact- checked 24 claims made by both campaigns.

Her brother is now in charge of the estate, the servants and maids who were almost like part of the family have died and been replaced by new staff members who are cold and unfamiliar. Her father, Count Blancheville, has been horribly disfigured and lives secluded in one of the castle's isolated towers.

The films script is closer to that of Roger Cormans films based on Poes work rather than the Italian gothic horror films of era. Director Alberto de Martino felt he was more inspired by Alfred Hitchcock. The film was shot at Monastery of Santa Maria La Real de Valdeiglesias in Spain and at Cinecitt√† in Rome. Release The Blancheville Monster was released in Italy on June 6, 1963 through Titanus. It was released in Italy under the title Horror as chosen by producer Italo Zingarelli.

The site of the building is 1280 square metres, formerly used by a Japanese fire insurance company and had undergone numerous reselling between several British firms.http://www.chinese- architecture.info/BUND/SH-BU-004.htm The building was initially planned by the Japanese shipping company Nisshin Kisen Kaisha Shipping Co. There was a lack of funding but a Jewish merchant agreed to pay half the costs of construction, and funded the construction of three of its stories. Construction of the building started in 1921 and it was completed in 1925. The architectural firm was Lester, Johnson and Morriss. It has a floor space of 5484 square metres. One of the earliest applicants for a space in the new building was a Japanese entrepreneur who wished to open a Turkish bath and restaurant in part of the basement. After the Second World War the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company took over the building. The building became owned by Shanghai Maritime Bureau shortly after the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949. The bureau continued to use the building until the 1990s when it moved to an office tower Pudong and this building was leased to different firms, most notably the Bund branch of Huaxia Bank and a gate was added to the south.

More than thirty volcanic edifices on an area of 20x30km2 make up this volcanic field, which consists mostly of monogenetic volcanic structures. The lavas are rhyolites, trachyandesites and andesites. The rivers Tetri Aragvi, Patara Liakhvi, Ksani and Didi Liakhvi originate from the Keli volcanic area, and some peaks drain into the Terek river. Several mountain ranges separate the area into distinct high plains. Quaternary Dacite lava flows overlie thich Mesozoic sedimentary sequences. Western Khorisar (elevation 3736 m) and Didi- Nepiskalo (3694 m) are the highest summits close to the crest of the Greater Caucasus. In the northeastern part of the system are the Nepiskalo volcanoes and several smaller structures. The Patara-Nepiskalo volcano is strongly degraded by glacial action and may have had a caldera. Other volcanoes are Sharkhokh, Northern Shadilkhokh, and Southern Shadilkhokh in the western Kaidon range and the lava flows created by the latter two volcanoes between the Arkhi Range, Keli Lake and the Aragvistavi river, the Ermani‚ÄìAkhubata lava plateau, Eastern Sharkhokh volcano and several lava domes (Ermani, Fidarkokh and others). N.I. Skhirtladze first studied the volcanoes and divided the volcanism into glacial and postglacial stages. Later research indicated three phases of volcanism: A first phase 245‚Äì170ka involved lava dome formation including Kordieritovyi dome, Patara-Nepiskalo volcano and Kabardzhin‚ÄìSakokhe centre and its associated a laval flow in the Aragvi valley. A second phase 137‚Äì70ka with large scale effusive activity included the \\"Pyramidal Peak\\" Volcano which dammed local rivers with lava flows. From 90ka on activity formed Didi-Nepiskalo and the Ekisom and Khorisar domes. The third phase less than 30ka with evidence that it continued into the Holocene formed Eastern Khorisa and Ploskaya Vershina. Activity of East Khorisar Volcano spans both stages and created lava flows in the Terek river valley, at the end involving the collapse of the northern flank of its crater.

At the Meet-Up, concert videos and films of the rock band the Grateful Dead are shown in movie theaters at multiple locations. Each yearly screening occurs only once. The event provides a venue and opportunity for the band's fans, known as Deadheads, to gather in celebration and camaraderie. From 2011 to 2018, the Grateful Dead Meet-Up at the Movies was shown at movie theaters throughout the United States, and was organized and managed by Fathom Events. The 2019 Meet- Up was shown internationally, with Trafalgar Releasing as the distribution partner. 2011 The first Grateful Dead Meet-Up at the Movies, on April 20, 2011, screened The Grateful Dead Movie in U.S. movie theaters. The Grateful Dead Movie is a music documentary that focuses on the band's October 16 to 20, 1974 performances at the Winterland Arena. It also includes interviews with the band members, and archival footage from earlier in their career. Shot on 35 mm film, it was co-directed by Jerry Garcia, and was originally released in theaters in 1977. 2012 The 2012 event occurred on April 19 at 7:00 pm local time in selected movie theaters around the U.S., and aired the Grateful Dead's performance of July 17, 1989 at the Alpine Valley Music Theatre near East Troy, Wisconsin. This concert took place one day after the Alpine Valley show documented in the feature-length music video Downhill from Here, which was released in 1997. 2013 The 2013 event occurred on August 1 and featured the music documentary film Sunshine Daydream in select U.S. movie theaters. Sunshine Daydream was shot at the concert performed on August 27, 1972 at the Old Renaissance Faire Grounds in Veneta, Oregon, and includes extensive footage of the audience as well as the band. In 2013 the movie was re-edited and restored from the original 16 mm film negatives, and remastered to a high-definition digital projection for the screening. The audio was also completely remastered. The film was shown in about 450 movie theaters in the U.S. The following month, Sunshine Daydream was released on DVD and Blu-ray, packaged together with a 3-CD album of the complete Veneta concert. 2014 The 2014 meet-up occurred on July 17 in movie theaters nationwide in the United States, and aired the Grateful Dead's performance of April 21, 1972 at the Beat Club television studio in Bremen, West Germany. The screenings began at 7:30 pm local time nationwide. The presentation was prepared from restored video from the original Beat Club broadcast and re-mastered audio from the original analog magnetic tapes. It also included a behind-the-scenes look at the production of an upcoming Grateful Dead release, with Bob Weir on guitar and vocals, and Jeffrey Norman performing mixing and mastering. 2015 Grateful Dead Meet-Up at the Movies 2015 occurred on May 4, 2015, with the presentation of a previously unreleased video of the Grateful Dead concert performed at the Alpine Valley Music Theatre near East Troy, Wisconsin on July 19, 1989.

He previously taught Islamic Studies at Qatar University, and once served as President of the Qatar Football Association, as well as having been a board member of Qatar Islamic Bank. He has been accused of being ‚Äúone of the world‚Äôs most prolific terrorist financiers.‚Äù  Political views  Al-Nuaimi was a staunch critic of the domestic policies of the former Emir of Qatar, Hamad bin Khalifa. In 1998, he circulated a letter condemning the emir's decisions to enfranchise women and to allow the sale of alcohol, as well as other policies which he described as being contrary to Islamic tradition. The letter was published in local newspapers and was signed by twelve other men, three of whom were members of the ruling family. He was detained without charge the same year, prompting protests in Britain by Islamic activists. He was released in 2001. Teaching career Abd Al-Rahman al-Nuaimi was a history professor at Qatar University until 2009. Gulf News reported that al-Nuaimi was ‚Äúpromoting Brotherhood ideals‚Äù and encouraged the Qatari Consultative Council to oppose co-education at the Qatar University. Qatar Football Association Al-Nuaimi previously served as the president of the Qatar Football Association.  Human rights advocacy and NGO associations In 2004, al-Nuaimi co-founded Alkarama, a Geneva-based human rights organization. Its mission is to ‚Äúassist all those in the Arab World subjected to or at risk of extra-judicial executions, disappearances, torture and arbitrary detention,‚Äù by connecting them with ‚Äúinternational human rights mechanisms.‚Äù Alkarama has worked with United Nations human rights bodies including the Committee Against Torture and the Human Rights Committee, as well as prominent international human rights organizations including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International. Although he denied the accusations leveled against him, he resigned as president of Alkarama in July 2014 after being named a Specially Designated Global Terrorist by the United States Department of the Treasury. Alkarama was first registered as a foundation in 2007 with al-Nuaimi as president and Qatari- national Sultan Khlaifa al-Khulaifi as Member/Secretary General.http://www.moneyhouse.ch/en/u/v/ge/fondation_alkarama_CH-660.1.422.007-2.htm In August 2009, Qatari businessman and Director General of the al-Furqan Schools, Khalifa Mohammad al-Rabban, was named President of Alkarama. Al- Nuaimi is also listed as the Secretary-General of the Global Anti-Aggression Campaign (GAAC) where Khalifa Mohammad al-Rabban is a member. The Executive Director of GAAC, Rabih Haddad, co-founded the Global Relief Foundation (GRC) designated by the UN and US for providing support to al-Qaeda and having connections to Osama bin Laden. The Global Anti-Aggression Campaign, an online human rights organization, has repeatedly hosted Hamas leaders, released anti- Western reports, and called for a confrontation with the West. Abd al-Rahman al-Nuaimi is a founding member of the Sheikh Eid bin Mohammad Al Thani Charitable Association, often referred to as Eid Charity. Eid Charity is a charitable organization with close ties to Qatari government institutions. Despite giving generously to a variety of charitable causes, Eid Charity has also partnered with Madid Ahl al-Sham, a defunct Qatar-based online conduit for donations intended for the al-Nusra Front, on several charity campaigns.  Terrorism accusations and international sanctions  On December 18, 2013, al-Nuaimi was designated as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist by the United States Department of the Treasury, which described him as ‚Äúa Qatar- based terrorist financier and facilitator who has provided money and material support and conveyed communications to al-Qa'ida and its affiliates in Syria, Iraq, Somalia and Yemen for more than a decade.‚Äù The Treasury Department alleged that, for an unspecified period of time, al-Nuaimi funneled over $2 million per month to Al-Qaeda in Iraq. He is also accused of providing $600,000 to Al-Qaeda representatives in Syria and $250,000 to Al-Shabaab in Somalia, in addition to an undisclosed amount to a Yemeni charity that funneled money to Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. While the accusations of financial support to terrorist organizations received the most attention, U.S. authorities also accused al-Nuaimi of providing communications and other support to the Iraqi insurgency between 2003 and 2004. Al-Nuaimi has steadfastly denied the allegations, and the executive director of Alkarama‚Äîwhich is not itself accused of any wrongdoing‚Äîhas argued that al- Nuaimi's designation as a terrorist financier and facilitator is a politically motivated attempt to silence a critic of United States policy in the Middle East. As part of its human rights work, Alkarama has documented civilian casualties resulting from U.S. drone strikes in Yemen. Human rights groups stress that Alkarama itself is a legitimate organization that has provided important access to information in cases of human rights violations in the region. The designation by the United States was followed by similar designations by the United Nations Security Council, the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Turkey, resulting in a travel ban and a freeze of al- Nuaimi's assets.

Biography Th√©ophile Henri Joseph Lepage, better known as Th√©ophile Lepage, was born in Limburg on March 24, 1901. Together with Alfred Errera he founded the seminar for mathematical analysis at the ULB. This seminar played an important role in the flourishing of the department of mathematics at this university. He was professor of mathematics at the University of Li√®ge from 1928 till 1930. He taught differential and integral calculus at the ULB from 1931 till 1956 and higher analysis from 1956 till 1971. For 43 years he was a member of the Acad√©mie Royale des Sciences, des Lettres et des Beaux-Arts de Belgique. On June 5, 1948, he was nominated a corresponding member and on June 9, 1956 an effective member of the Acad√©mie. In 1963 he became president of the Acad√©mie and director of the Klasse Wetenschappen. He was also active in the Belgisch Wiskundig Genootschap. He died in Verviers on April 1, 1991. His mathematical work At the ULB, the ideas and the enthusiasm of Th√©ophile de Donder formed the foundation of a flourishing mathematical tradition. Thanks to student Th√©ophile Lepage, external differential calculus acquired one of the most helpful methods introduced in mathematics during the 20th century, and one for which De Donder was a pioneer, presenting new applications in the resolution of a classical problem--the partial differential equation of Monge-Amp√®re--and in the synthesis of the methods of Th√©ophile de Donder, Hermann Weyl and Constantin Carath√©odory into a calculus of variations of multipal integrals. Thanks to the use of differential geometry, it is possible to avoid long and boring calculations. The results of Lepage were named in reference works. His methods are still inspiring contemporary mathematicians: Boener and Sniatycki talked about the congruence of Lepage; not so long ago, Demeter Krupka, introduced--beside the eulerian forms which correspond to the classical equations of the calculus of variations of Euler--the so-called lepagian forms or equivalents of Lepage in equations of variations on fiber spaces. We also have Lepage to thank for interesting results concerning linear representations of the symplectic group, and more specifically Lepage's dissolution of an outer potency of the product of an even number of duplicates of a complex surface.

After he was admitted into the order he selected the new name of \\"Innocenzo from Caltagirone\\". He was well known for his frequent and often sensational predications and miracles attributed to him since 1623. Due to this he was granted the moniker of \\"The Miracle Worker of the Earth\\". He was declared to be Venerable in 2009 after the recognition of his life of heroic virtue. A miracle required for him to be beatified is now under investigation and must receive papal approval before beatification can take place. Life Giuseppe Marcin√≤ was born in Caltagirone on 24 October 1859 to Pietro Marcin√≤ and Laura Barone. He studied in a school that the Jesuits ran and finished his studies in 1607 at the time he entered the novitiate of the Order of Friars Minor. He change his name to \\"Innocenzo from Caltagirone\\" after his formal profession as a member of the order. He continued his studies in both philosophical and theological studies in the monasteries of places such as Malta. It was there in 1613 that he was ordained to the priesthood. He studied Hebrew in Rome after this until 1615 and returned to his home to teach Hebrew at a high school. He taught theological studies from 1619 until a decade later at Capuchin institutions. He also preached Lenten retreats. He served as the first Minister Provincial of the Capuchin order from 1635 to 1638 in Syracuse and later in Messina from 1638 to 1640. He was then transferred in the same post in Otranto from 1642 until 1643 when he was selected as the Minister General of the order. He visited all institutions as part of his new role. Pope Innocent X - in 1647 - dispatched him to the monarchs of Spain and France to restore peace between the two but it was something that turned out as unsuccessful. He returned home after this where he died on 16 November 1655. The place of burial soon became a pilgrimage site for those who requested his intercession with God. Beatification process The beatification process commenced at the behest of the order on 26 September 1890 under Pope Leo XIII in a local process that ensured until 30 October 1892 and bestowed upon him the posthumous title Servant of God. The second local process saw the continuation of the assemblage of documentation and spanned from 1920 until 1922; the two processes were both ratified in 1992 in order for the cause to proceed to the next phase. The Positio - documentation on his life of heroic virtue and an account of his life - were submitted to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in 1995. Pope Benedict XVI approved this and declared him to be Venerable on 3 April 2009. The miracle for his beatification was investigated and received ratification to confirm that it was a valid process on 19 December 2008.

In 1777 he was appointed Regent of the Secretariat for Foreign Affairs and in 1779 he became First Secretary. Although from an old noble family, he owed his rise largely to his connexions with the Ferrero della Marmora family and with Archbishop Rorengo di Ror√† of Turin, and to his marriage into the Lascaris di Ventimiglia family. Perrone's residency in London was associated with a strong emphasis on Sardinia's commercial interests in Britain. In 1751 he was rewarded with the rank of cornet in a prestigious court regiment. In late 1752 and early 1753, he was involved with the negotiations between Charles Emmanuel and Archbishop Herring regarding the possible translation of the relics of St Anselm from Canterbury Cathedral to Aosta in Sardinia (now Italy). The archbishop was not adverse to the idea and Perron's investigation was of the opinion that Anselm's remains were probably intact and misidentified as Theobald's, but the matter was uncertain and seems to have been dropped. The archbishop's original plan to foist \\"any other old Bishop with the Name of Anselm\\" \\"on the Simpletons\\" was foiled by the ambassador's insistence that he personally witness any excavation to procure the remains. Between 1755 and 1777, Perrone lived in semi-retirement. Although he continued to hold court and military titles, he spent his time looking after his own estates. In 1779 he was appointed to the Order of the Annunziata. In 1784, he used his connexions to secure the appointment of his son-in-law's brother, the Cavaliere Nomis di Pollone, as resident minister in London (until 1787). Notes Bibliography * . * . * .

The company is known for their subscription service where customers receive new razor blades, shaving cream, and other grooming products by mail. Harry's is based in New York. The company was founded in July 2012 by Andy Katz-Mayfield and Jeff Raider. The company launched its subscription service in March 2013. In February 2014, Harry's acquired the German razor blade manufacturer Feintechnik for $100 million. In May 2019, Edgewell Personal Care, the owner of the Schick brand of shaving products, announced it would purchase Harry's for $1.4 billion. The merger was intended to finalise by the end of the first quarter of 2020. In February 2020, the Federal Trade Commission sued Edgewell to block the merger, stating that bringing Schick and Harry's together could hurt competition.  History  The company was founded in July 2012 by Andy Katz-Mayfield and Jeff Raider. The subscription service launched in March 2013. In January 2014, Harry's purchased the Feintechnik razor factory in Germany for a reported $100 million in an effort to provide control over the entire process of manufacturing their products. In July 2015 the company received a third-round financing of US$75.6 million. In an interview published in July 2016, Katz-Mayfield said Harry's had two million customers. As of January 2017, Harry's shaving products are also available at Target stores. In late June 2017, Harry's started selling its products in the United Kingdom. In February 2018, Harry's raised $112 million in Series D funding co-led by Alliance Consumer Growth and Temasek co-led, with participation from Tao Capital Partners. In October 2018, Harry's launched Flamingo, a women's skin care brand. In May 2019, Edgewell Personal Care, the owner of the Schick brand of shaving products, announced plans to purchase Harry's for $1.4 billion. The merger was intended to finalise by the end of the first quarter of 2020. On February 3, 2020, the Federal Trade Commission sued Edgewell to block the merger, stating that bringing Schick and Harry's together could hurt competition and Edgewell backed away from the deal. In March 2020, Harry's launched Cat Person as an independent startup out of the company's innovation group, Harry's Labs. https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/24/backed-by-harrys-labs- cat-person-launches-its-lineup-of-cat-care-products/ Cat Person is a lineup of cat care products including grain-free cat food (available as subscription or √† la carte), toys, beds, and bowls. Philanthropy Similar to Warby Parker, which was also co-founded by Jeff Raider, Harry's began with a buy-one-donate- one business model, donating a free razor blade (or the cost of one) to charitable organizations. The program started in 2013 by supporting The Mission Continues to help veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, and it was called the \\"Give a Shave\\" program. By the end of 2013, the \\"Give a Shave\\" program had changed slightly such that Harry's would donate 1% of their sales and the employees would donate 1% of their time to charitable organizations like City Year. Currently, the donation model remains 1% of sales, and employees now receive five days of paid time off to volunteer with a registered non-profit organization. Various charities have received this benefit, and Harry's has recently focused on promoting better mental health care for men and suicide prevention, making news for working with organizations such as Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM), HEADstrong Foundation, and The Trevor Project.

World War I and Finnish Civil War  Kalm was born to a farmer's family in the village of Kotsama in Viljandi County. His last name is connected with the old Finno- Ugric word \\"kalma\\", meaning \\"death\\". According to a family legend, one of Kalm's forefathers survived the Black Death by hiding in a remote cemetery island and therefore changed his name. Kalm was recruited by the Imperial Russian Army in 1914 and fought in the First World War in the Gulf of Riga. After the 1917 Russian Revolution he fled to Finland and joined the White Guards. In the 1918 Finnish Civil War he led a battalion mostly composed of the students of two park ranger colleges from √Ñht√§ri and Evo.Hein√§m√§ki, Jaakko: ‚Ä≥Hans Kalm: vapaussoturi ja vaihtoehtol√§√§k√§ri‚Ä≥, p. 11‚Äì13.

Google Books (in Finnish)  War in Estonia  Kalm resigned from the White Army in July 1918 and left for Estonia, where he became the commander of the Pohjan Pojat regiment fighting in the Estonian War of Independence. It was a unit composed of Finnish volunteers. Pohjan Pojat was disbanded in May 1919 and Kalm returned Finland. In 1923‚Äì1933 he lived in the United States studying medicine and working as a doctor in New Jersey and New York. He was granted United States citizenship in 1930. Kalm returned to Finland again in 1934 and settled in Rauma in Western Finland. He was interested in alternative medicine like naturopathy, orthopathy, and homeopathy and even ran a spa.Hans Kalm (1889‚Äì1981) ‚Äì virolaissuomalainen sotilas ja vaihtoehtol√§√§k√§ri (in Finnish). Arno Forsius. Retrieved 10 July 2015.  World War II and post-war years  As Finland joined the Second World War, Kalm was briefly the commander of a POW camp in Pieks√§m√§ki. He was released in October 1941 and sent to Germany to study military health issues for the Finnish Army. During the war, Kalm was also active in the Finnish Nazi organization Suomen Kansallissosialistinen Ty√∂j√§rjest√∂ (KTJ).Ekberg, Henrik: ‚Ä≥F√ºhrerns trogna f√∂ljeslagare.

To avoid being arrested for his misconduct at the Pieks√§m√§ki prison camp, Kalm fled to the United States via Sweden in 1946. According to his own story, Kalm worked as a cardiac specialist in Aiken County, South Carolina and later studied surgery in Mexico. In 1957 Kalm returned to Finland to practice homeopathic medicine. His doctor's license was finally cancelled in 1974 as Finnish authorities found out that Mid-West Medical College, where Kalm had graduated in 1933, was not approved by the American Medical Association.

The company was founded in Rochester, New York in the 1880s as a narrow-loom weaving operation. By 1988 it had manufacturing facilities in twelve countries, making seals for windows and doors in buildings and automobiles. That year it was acquired by BTR plc of the United Kingdom. In 1997 the Schlegel operations were acquired by UniPoly S.A. in a BTR management buy-out. From 2006 Schlegel International, with manufacturing operations in Europe, Australia and Brazil, was a subsidiary of Lupus Capital, now called Tyman plc. The Schlegel brand is also used for products made near Rochester, New York, by Schlegel International's North American sister company AmesburyTruth. History Early years Charles P. Schlegel and Henry A. Schaefer founded a narrow loom weaving business in Rochester, New York, United States, in the late 1880s. Schlegel Manufacturing was first located on North Water Street, soon after moved to Canal Street and finally moved to the corner of Goodman Street and College Avenue. The company at first made hem bindings for women's skirts to protect them when dragging on the ground, then diversified into \\"surrey fringes\\" for horse-drawn buggies. For many years the company advertised its product line as \\"carriage, basket and dress trimmings\\". The company moved into supplying textile trimmings to car manufacturers, and became a specialist in automobile door and window weather seals. Schlegel Canada Inc. was established in 1931. During World War II (1939‚Äì1945) the company tore down and redesigned its looms so they could make machine gun belts. There were many technical difficulties, including specification changes, but full production began by the summer of 1943. The company produced six million belts for .30 and .50 caliber machine gun bullets, then converted to making gun slings. After the war the company expanded into making seals for all types of doors and windows. Schlegel started to make pile weatherstripping and plastic profiles for the building industry. In 1956 the president of Schlegel Manufacturing Company was Carl F. Schlegel, and the Vice President, Research was Norman C. Schlegel. The company's laboratory was investigating industrial textiles, plastics and adhesives. In the 1960s Schlegel introduced a continuous molded urethane process for foam weatherstripping. As of 1973 Schlegel Manufacturing, based in Rochester, New York, was supplying rigid vinyl strips for weathersealing doors. In 1973 it was announced that Schlegel Illinois. Inc., a subsidiary, had introduced a closed-cell sponge rubber gasket for drums. As of 1981 Schlegel had become a major conglomerate, still with its headquarters in Rochester, with one of its main factories in Henrietta, New York. By 1986 Schlegel Corporation of Rochester, New York, had 22 marketing centers worldwide, including Schlegel Technology Pte Ltd in Singapore and Schlegel Pty Ltd in Australia. In 1988 Schlegel had manufacturing facilities in twelve countries. Schlegel Corporation made automobile and building products in Europe through its subsidiaries Schlegel UK and Schlegel GmbH. Schlegel UK had two separate operating divisions for Automotive and Building products. Ford and Rover accounted for about two- thirds of the Automotive product's sales. By the late 1980s the company was in difficulty. Schlegel UK had signed a contract with Rover that required it to make a \\"sprayed-on slip coat\\" window seal, and had difficulty with the unfamiliar technology. The factory building required extensive repairs. The company was offered for sale. Prospective buyers included BTR Plc, Draftex, Pirelli/Metzler, Diversitech, Standard Products and Continental AG. BTR subsidiary The UK-based BTR plc purchased Schlegel Corporation in late 1988 through a subsidiary. BTR Dunlop, a wholly owned US-based subsidiary of BTR plc, was the purchaser. After the purchase, BTR decided to transfer the Schlegel UK and Schlegel GmbH subsidiaries from Schlegel Corporation to itself. There was some controversy over how the transfer should be valued for tax purposes, with the company valuing the Schlegel UK and Schlegel GmbH subsidiaries at $21,846,000 and $9,400,000, while the Internal Revenue Service valued them at $49,069,000 and $13,246,000. In 1990 Schlegel Corporation purchased a rubber facility built in 1937 in Keokuk, Iowa, from United Technologies Corporation. In 1995 BTR rebranded the product line to BTR Sealing Systems. In 1993 the UK subsidiary reported that it was upgrading to infrared ovens to bond the low-friction coating to its car window seals, reducing time and energy used in the process. In July 1995 it was announced that BTR, parent of US-based Schlegel Corporation and manufacturer of automotive component businesses such as Metzeler and Dunlop, was establishing a joint venture in New Delhi, India. Wadco-Schlegel would make automotive body and glass channel seals for Indian vehicle manufacturers. At this time BTR made about 18% of its rubber-related sales in the US, mainly through Schlegel and the Stowe Woodward manufacturer of roll coverings and printing blankets. Later ownership changes In November 1997 UniPoly S.A, bought 32 companies from BTR, including the Schlegel Sealing and Shielding Group. The acquisition cost about $867 million. The deal was a management buy-out in which UniPoly Group was formed to take over most of the rubber products business of BTR PLC. As of 2001 its main operations were UniPoly Enerka (conveyor belts), UniPoly Hiflex Netherlands (fluid handling) and UniPoly Schlegel Holdings. In 2001 the banks that had funded the buy-out installed Michael Teacher as chief executive in an effort to turn around the struggling business. In March 2006 Lupus Capital bought the Schlegel Building Products Division from Unipoly. The acquisition cost Lupus ¬£84 million on a debt free/cash free basis. Lupus Capital is the vehicle for Greg Hutchings. The sale of Schlegel reduced UniPoly debt to close to par. Lupus Capital plc changed its name to Tyman plc in February 2013. In February 2014 Schlegel International completed acquisition of Vedasil, a Brazilian manufacturer of pile weatherseals. Structure As of July 2015, Schlegel International was a division of Tyman, an international supplier of door and window components. The company had manufacturing plants in the UK, Spain, Germany, Australia and Brazil. Manufacturing subsidiaries, which also distribute products: * Schlegel UK (Henlow, Bedfordshire), foam weatherstrip * Schlegel Building Products (Newton Aycliffe, County Durham, UK), pile weatherstrip and extrusions * Schlegel Spain (Barcelona, Spain), pile weatherstrip * Schlegel Germany (Hamburg, Germany), foam weatherstrip and extrusions * Schlegel Australia (Sydney, Australia), foam and pile weatherstrips and other products * Schlegel Brazil (Valinhos, Brazil), door & window weather seals and insect screens Distribution subsidiaries: * Schlegel Italy (Milan, Italy) * Schlegel New Zealand (Auckland, New Zealand) * Schlegel Singapore (Singapore) The other Tyman divisions in 2015 were AmesburyTruth (hardware components, extrusions and sealing systems) and ERA (Security). The Schlegel division of Amesbury, located in Rochester, NY, manufactures urethane foam, plastic and textile weatherstripping for windows and doors in buildings, and products for the transportation and copier industries. Products The company makes foam, brush pile and extruded seals. Hardware components included locks, handles, hinges and friction stays. The Singapore subsidiary also distributes Dr Hahn hinges in the Asia-Pacific market. A 1996 book describes Schlegel seals being used in acoustic doors. Schlegel makes sealing systems and related hardware products for distributors and fabricators.

The location is of considerable interest because in the summer of 1872 (i.e. some ten years earlier), Vincent's brother Theo had come to visit Vincent at The Hague and together they had walked to a mill at Rijswijk (presumed to be the Laakmolen, one of just two at Rijswijk) where they drank milk together. It seems this walk held special emotional significance for Vincent, as he later referred to it several times in his letters to Theo. Biographers have suggested that at this time they made a pact together to pursue a career in art.Naifeh et al., p. 76 n. 187 The Laakmolen (middle windmill) The watercolor sold for ¬£2,322,500 at Christies, London, on 23 June 2015.

It was published posthumously in 1929.Eric Schwandt, \\"A New Gloria for Satie's Messe des pauvres\\", Canadian University Music Review, vol. 18, no. 2, 1998, p. 40, note 11, at http://www.erudit.org/revue/cumr/1998/v18/n2/1014653ar.pdf A performance lasts around 12 minutes. Background Suzanne Valadon, portrait on music paper by Satie (1893) The Danses gothiques was composed in the middle of Satie's six- month love affair (January to June, 1893) with the painter Suzanne Valadon, when he was torn between his religious preoccupations of the period and more earthly matters. It was the only intimate relationship he is known to have had, and he was clearly the more emotionally vulnerable of the two. The free- spirited Valadon, whom Satie affectionately called \\"Biqui\\", took a room near his at 6 Rue Cortot in Montmartre to facilitate the romance; and she painted a now-famous portrait of him, one of her earliest efforts in oils. But she rejected his proposal of marriage and continued to see other men.John Storm, \\"The Valadon Drama: The Life of Suzanne Valadon\\", E. P. Dutton & Co., New York, 1959, p. 104. Chief among them was the stockbroker Paul Moussis, with whom she had an intermittent but long-standing liaison until they finally married in 1896. \\"At that stage in her life, her love affairs seemed to pass over her like sunshine\\", Valadon biographer June Rose noted.June Rose, \\"Suzanne Valadon: Mistress of Montmartre\\", St. Martin's, 1999. Given their shared connections in the Montmartre bohemian scene, it is unlikely Satie would not have at least heard rumors about this.Olof H√∂jer, notes to \\"Erik Satie: The Complete Piano Music, Vol. 2\\", pp. 18-20, Swedish Society Discofil, 1996. His status as a part-time lover, whether he recognized it or not, is suggested in his only surviving letter to Valadon, dated March 11, 1893. He is trying to arrange a date with her: \\"Don't forget that your poor friend hopes to see you...Let me add, Biqui ch√©ri, that I shall on no account get angry if you can't come to any of these rendezvous; I have now become terribly reasonable; and in spite of the great happiness it gives me to see you I am beginning to understand that you can't always do what you want.\\"Ornella Volta, \\"Satie Seen Through His Letters\\", Marion Boyars Publishers, New York, 1989, pp. 45-46. Satie was soon working on the Danses gothiques, which was completed between March 21 and 23, 1893. His conflicted feelings are reflected in the subtitle of the piece, \\"A Novena for the great calm and profound tranquility of my Soul\\".http://imslp.eu/download.php?file=files/imglnks/euimg/9/95/IMSLP14401-Satie_- _Danses_Gothiques.pdf Music and texts The title of the Danses gothiques is something of a misnomer. It is in fact one continuous piece of music, a series of interrelated chord sequences unified by a recurring rhythmic figure of two eighth notes and a quarter note.Rovi review at Allmusic http://www.allmusic.com/composition/mc0002358058 These were divided - apparently after the music was composed - into nine parts by what Robert Orledge called \\"quasi-religious and self-pitying titles.\\"Robert Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", Cambridge University Press, 1990, pp. 157, 276. The central focus is the Dance No. 5 (For the poor deceased), which in length almost exactly balances No. 1 and employs all but one of the work's motifs. The \\"dances\\" themselves are meditative rather than dance-like, and are all to be played tr√®s lent (\\"very slow\\"), the characteristic tempo of Satie's \\"Rosicrucian\\" compositions. Saint Benedict Curiously, four of the titles (Nos. 4, 7-9) are introduced in mid-motif, obscuring where the parts are supposed to begin and end. Satie, with his interdisciplinary interests, was as much concerned with the look of his scores on the printed page as he was with their musical effect.http://www.gresham.ac.uk/lectures-and-events/erik-satie- part-one-saties-musical-and-personal-logic-and-satie-as-poet. Robert Orledge, \\"Satie's Musical and Personal Logic\\", transcript of Gresham College lecture delivered April 16, 2010. This led Swedish pianist-musicologist Olof H√∂jer, who recorded Satie's complete keyboard works in the 1990s, to suggest a theory about the extramusical structure of the Danses gothiques: \\"Judging by the appearance of the manuscript, it seems that his main interest was the optical impression that the arrangement of the different parts would make on the score along with the headings. Perhaps this is an early example - maybe even the first - of a musical mise en page, an artistically intended integration of music, notation and text, quite probably inspired by Satie's contact with contemporary poets.\\"Olof H√∂jer, notes to \\"Erik Satie\\", pp. 18-20. Satie's dedication reads, \\"To the Transcendent, Solemn and Representative Ecstasy of Saint Benedict, and the Preparatory Methodology of the Most Powerful Benedictine Order.\\" The titles are: Saint Lucy with her eyes on a platter :1. A l'occasion d'une grande peine (On the occasion of a great sorrow) :2. Dans laquelle les P√®res de la Tr√®s V√©ritable et Tr√®s Sainte √âglise sont invoqu√©s (On which the Fathers of the True and Holy Church are invoked) :3. En faveur d'un malheureux (On behalf of a poor wretch) :4. A propos de Saint Bernard et de Sainte Lucie (Concerning Saint Bernard and Saint Lucy) :5. Pour les pauvres tr√©pass√©s (For the poor deceased) :6. O√π il est queston du pardon des injures recues (Where there is question of forgiveness for insults received) :7. Par pit√© pour les ivrognes, honteux, d√©bauch√©s, imparfaits, d√©sagr√©ables, et faussaires en tous (Out of pity for the drunken, disgraced, corrupted, faulty, unlikable, and forgers) :8. En le haut honneur du v√©n√©r√© Saint Michel, le gracieux Archange (In high honor of the venerable Saint Michael, the graceful Archangel) :9. Apr√®s avoir obtenu la remise de ses fautes (After having obtained the remission of their faults) Saint Michael weighing souls Satie read extensively about the lives of the Catholic saints,Patrick Gowers and Nigel Wilkins, \\"Erik Satie\\", \\"The New Grove: Twentieth-Century French Masters\\", Macmillan Publishers Limited, London, 1986, p. 130. Reprinted from \\"The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians\\", 1980 edition. and the four invoked in the Danses gothiques may well have had a personal significance for him. Apart from preaching reasonableness in living amongst others, Saint Benedict advocated an architecture for sacred buildings that was austere and devoid of ornamentation,Alban Butler, Paul Burns, \\"Butler's Lives of the Saints: August\\", A&C; Black, 1995, p. 201. a creative aesthetic Satie pursued in music throughout his life. Benedict is also a patron of the dying, and this provides a thematic link between the dedication and the titles of Dances Nos. 5 and 8. The latter is dedicated to Saint Michael, the archangel of death who weighs souls on a scale to determine their eligibility for heaven. Saint Bernard - the Lactation Miracle The title Concerning Saint Bernard and Saint Lucy (No. 4) touches on Satie's lifelong fascination with eyes and their recurrence as a literary motif in his work.See Robert Orledge, notes to Soundkiosk editions of Satie's music, 2011, p. 19. http://www.soundkiosk.com/pdffiles/Sample%20book%20web%20Vol%203.pdf At first glance the 12th century French abbot who preached the Second Crusade and the 3rd century Sicilian virgin martyr would seem a strange pairing. But Saint Lucy is a patron of the blind, and eyes figure in the iconography of both. Saint Lucy was often depicted bearing her eyes on a platter, having (according to one tradition) gouged them out herself to ward off a persistent suitor.In his \\"Christian ballet\\" Uspud (1892) Satie presented a Saint Micanar (?) also carrying his eyes on a platter. And in a variant of Saint Bernard's \\"Lactation Miracle\\" he was healed of an ailment that threatened his sight by praying to an image of the Nursing Madonna. The icon came to life and squirted her breast milk into his eyes.Patrick J. Hayes, \\"Miracles: An Encyclopedia of People, Places, and Supernatural Events from Antiquity to the Present\\", ABC-CLIO, 2016, p. 78. The other headings seem to strike a more direct personal note. Olof H√∂jer wrote, \\"It is certainly tempting to see these titles...as references to [Satie] and his relationship with Suzanne Valadon, veiled under liturgic wordings. As a whole, a strange and remarkable contrast: abstract and totally unemotional piano structures functioning as a purification for a soul tormented by carnal lust and erotic conflicts. Is this music made for listening? Or even for playing?\\"H√∂jer, notes to \\"Erik Satie\\", pp. 18-20. Conclusion Satie appeared to have been initially pleased with the Danses gothiques. On March 24, 1893, the day after its completion, he registered the music with SACEM with an eye towards future publication. But after Valadon left him in June he put it aside to gather dust. Three other compositions have been linked to the Satie-Valadon affair and its end: the brief song Bonjour Biqui, Bonjour! (1893), the notorious piano piece Vexations (c. 1893), and the Messe des pauvres (1893-1895). Virtually none of this material was published in Satie's lifetime. In 1911, when Parisian audiences belatedly began to embrace his music, Satie allowed No. 1 of the Danses gothiques to appear in the March issue of the Soci√©t√© musicale ind√©pendante's journal Revue musicale; but he made no further effort to promote a piece that could have held painful memories for him. After Satie's death Darius Milhaud arranged to have the complete score published by Rouart, Lerolle & Cie.

His parent's house was a small, low building of large granite blocks built in 1827, with a ground floor room lit by two windows, and a bedroom on the floor above. He had taught himself to read by the age of five. He first went to school when he was twelve, but only during the winter, helping his father in the fields during the rest of the year. The local priest noticed his extraordinary gifts and persuaded his parents to let him continue his studies. At the age of 15 he was enrolled in the minor seminary of Saint Flour. Pouget completed his studies at the age of 19 and became a priest of the P√®res Lazaristes. From 1872 to 1905 he taught various subjects at √âvreux, Saint Flour, Dax and Paris. On 20 July 1905 he was forbidden from further teaching since he was \\"too far ahead of his time\\", despite the support of his superior.

Biography After graduation from the gymnasium with distinction in 1943, majoring in science and mathematics, he studied English language and literature at the University of Copenhagen. In 1948 he gained a scholarship for graduate study at the University of Minnesota, where he spent the next eight years until he came to Princeton in 1956. His doctoral dissertation, ‚ÄúThe Study of Language in England, 1780‚Äì1860‚Äù, was completed in 1960. It was published by Princeton University Press in 1967 (re-issued 1983), and soon became a classic among historians of linguistics. He was a much sought-after guest speaker at many conferences and universities in and outside the United States. He stayed at Princeton, where he rose to the rank of full professor in 1972, for the rest of his career. Academic work Right from the start, Aarsleff‚Äôs work on the history of linguistics fanned out to cover the history of ideas, the history of philosophy, and the history of science, resulting in major essays on Leibniz, Locke, Condillac, Wilhelm von Humboldt, Descartes, and Herder. In 1982, a selection of his essays was published under the title ‚ÄúFrom Locke to Saussure: Essays in the Study of Language and Intellectual History‚Äù, again a high profile publication in the field. Aarsleff also contributed a number of entries to Charles C. Gillispie‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Dictionary of Scientific Biography‚Äù, among which are major essays on John Wilkins and Thomas Sprat. In June 1991, a special conference was held in honor of Hans Aarsleff at the Sorbonne in Paris. This resulted in a festschrift ‚ÄúLa linguistique entre mythe et histoire‚Äù, edited by Daniel Droixhe and Chantal Grell (M√ºnster: Nodus, 1993). Aarsleff's writings on Wilhelm von Humboldt caused controversy as they drew attention to the fact that Humboldt was heavily influenced by French philosophers and linguists, which was denied by established German scholarship. His writings on the French-Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure caused similar controversy, as he argued that Saussure‚Äôs central ideas were strongly influenced by the French 19th-century philosopher-critic Hippolyte Taine, which was denied by Saussure scholars, who have shown that the ideas which Aarsleff attributes to Taine can be traced to other sources about whom Saussure himself wrote, whereas there is not a single reference to Taine in his vast writings, published and unpublished. In 1970, Aarsleff published an article ‚ÄúThe history of linguistics and Professor Chomsky‚Äù in the high-profile linguistic periodical Language. This article drew much attention as it was an attack on Noam Chomsky's much publicized work of the preceding years in the history of linguistics, contending that it was based on deficient and partisan scholarship. Although major specialists in the field were of the same opinion, the fierce and vilifying reactions by Chomsky and his followers made Aarsleff a controversial figure among Chomskyan theoretical linguists.

The 162 kilometers long road has been in use at the latest in the 9th century and in many parts it has been in use since. Today, Finnish national road 10 fulfills the same purpose as the connection between Turku and H√§meenlinna, but it follows the original route only near Turku.  History  The Oxen Road links two major Iron Age settlement areas in Finland, the valley of the Aurajoki river and the Lake Vanaja region of H√§me. Vanaja region was one of the main areas in Finland in prehistoric times to acquire articles for export, such as furs and hides. The Aurajoki river valley was the region where these exports passed through to the Baltic sea. The road was a joint institution of several ancient parishes in Western Finland. The road passes through two ancient provinces, Lieto in Turku and ancient Vanaja in H√§me which has probably required some kind of agreeing upon on the rights of transit. The road was also probably used to link other prehistorical provinces together.  Etymology  The origin of the term \\"H√§meen h√§rk√§tie\\" - the Oxen road of Tavastia is not known. The term occurs mainly in H√§me at the far end of the road in folk poetry of the road-side parishes. The folk poetry in Finland proper exclude the term \\"Oxen road\\" with some exceptions in the environments of the Halikonlahti bay in present-day Salo. Halikonlahti bay has been traditionally seen as the ancient port of the Tavastians.  Route  The first known description of the route of the road is made by Jaakko Teitti in 1556. At the time the road was 162 kilometers long and the route started from the Aura river valley and continued via villages of Lieto, Tarvasjoki, Marttila, Koski, Somero, Tammelan Letku, Tammelan Porras and Renko continuing through sparsely populated uplands of Tammela to H√§me Castle. Winter time winter roads were used and the route of the road varied on small degree. Journey from Turku to H√§me took approximately 4‚Äì6 days. In 1938 the route was designated Finnish national road 10, but in 1962 a new road with a different route was built to replace H√§meen H√§rk√§tie as a new road 10. The route is currently scattered among multiple regional roads, private roads and streets. Parts have been designated as a scenic route for tourism purposes.

It replaced the River Rapids Log Ride, a log flume which had to be removed due to its constant maintenance and the lack of extra parts due to the fact that the manufacturer only made two log flume attractions. The park was looking for a suitable replacement for the ride. Ride experience The ride, located in the center of the park, can be distinguished by its bright green track. The Monster features a vertical lift hill and a first drop at a 101 degree angle. At the bottom of the hill the riders reach a top speed of . The next element is a large overbanked turn where riders are redirected into a hill and then navigate the twisted drop that goes directly into a Finnish loop, after which riders go into a dive loop that will take riders into an air time hill then an Immelmann loop. The car then goes into its last curve, another dive loop, and its final inversion, a corkscrew.  Characteristics  The ride in total has of track, five inversions and takes roughly 2 minutes to complete. It is the park's newest coaster in nearly twenty years and cost $9 million. It joins Adventureland's other coasters ‚Äì the Tornado, Outlaw, Dragon, Phoenix, and the Underground ‚Äì and is the third steel roller coaster at the park, the other two being the Dragon and the Phoenix.

It ran north and south from Patchogue to just east of Port Jefferson, lying mostly west of New York State Route 112, crossing it at Port Jefferson Road in Port Jefferson Station. Route description Beginning in Patchogue at what is today the intersection of East Main Street and NY 112, the road survives as Medford Avenue which was widened to four lanes from East Main Street to Clark Street in 1964, then to five lanes north of the vicinity of the interchange with Sunrise Highway. In North Patchogue, near Shaber Road, Route 112 moves to the northeast onto Port Jefferson-Patchogue Highway, while the original Bicycle Path goes straight north from Medford Avenue to Old Medford Avenue. Bicycle Path(now Old Medford Avenue) south of the 1907 bridge for the Main Line of the Long Island Rail Road; circa 1988. Near the Main Line of the Long Island Rail Road in Medford, Bicycle Path used to climb over a narrow wooden grade crossing. The crossing was replaced by a bridge in 1907. As Old Medford Avenue crosses under the Long Island Expressway, it leaves Medford and enters Farmingville, where it enters a residential area north of Suffolk CR 16(Horse Block Road). North of Granny Road, Old Medford Avenue ends, and the remnants of the original name of the road is exposed, as South Bicycle Path. This road winds through the legendary steep hills of Farmingville and Selden, past an area which later in the 20th century included the Bald Hill Ski Bowl until 1980. An interchange was built over the road for an extension of Suffolk CR 83 known as Patchogue-Mount Sinai Road in the early 1960s, but the road itself wasn't built until 1972.[New Highway Opens Up in Central Brookhaven (columnist unknown); The Mid-Island News; December 21, 1972.] Currently, South Bicycle Path terminates at a cul-de-sac north of Ormond Avenue in Selden. At that point, the road originally cut across a southeast-to-northwest trail across NY 25, but this section south of NY 25 was closed in 1932.[Hagstrom's Atlas of Western Suffolk County, New York (1952, 1958, others)] A hotel built along NY 25 west of Adirondack Drive known as Norton's Wheelman's Rest was designed to accommodate bicycle riders,[The Port Jefferson Echo, September 8, 1900] but left to deteriorate later in the 20th century. The property where the hotel once stood is now a row of batting cages. Bicycle Path resumes north of NY 25 in Selden as North Bicycle Path, however the original intersection was replaced with a branch of the Middle Country Library. The current intersection takes a jughandle around this building and intersects with the original road in front of an elementary school, then heads north through a residential area.

UNAI was the sister coalition of Euskadiko Ezkerra, that presented lists in Gipuzkoa, Araba and Bizkaia. History UNAI was formed by several Basque nationalist and communist parties that had been part of the platform Euskal Erakunde Herritarra. The members of the coalition were Euskal Iraultzarako Alderdia (EIA), Euskadiko Mugimendu Komunista (EMK), the Organization of Communist Left (OIC-EKE) and the Revolutionary Organization of Workers (ORT). UNAI advocated the right of self-determination and the incorporation of Navarre to the Basque Country. In the general election of July 1977 the head of the list was Javier Erice, who had been mayor of Pamplona for a few months in 1976, until he was dismissed by the civil governor. UNAI brought together the majority of the left-wing Basque nationalist vote in Navarre, obtaining the 9.47% of the total vote and becoming the third political force in the province.Results. Despite this relative success, the 24,489 votes were not enough to gain a deputy in the Constituent Parliament (UCD obtained three deputies and the PSE-PSOE the other two). UNAI also failed to gain representation in the Senate. UNAI sent Jesus Urra to the commission that prepared the 1977 pre-autonomic agreement; this caused several activists of Euskadiko Ezkerra, that were against supporting any autonomic agreement that didn't include the KAS Alternative, to leave the coalition and join the newly formed Herri Batasuna (HB). UNAI was more affected more by this split than Euskadiko Ezkerra. Also, due to discrepancies over this issue, EMK and EIA left the coalition. Furthermore, in December 1978, the ORT was \\"expelled\\" for registering the initials of the coalition. In practice, that meant that only the ORT could use that acronym, and that the rest of parties had been de facto expelled from UNAI. In the general elections of March 1979, with a fully controlled by the ORT candidacy, the head of the list was Jos√© Miguel Ibarrola (secretary general of the Sindicato Unitario). UNAI got 10,970 votes (4.34% of the total), far from obtaining any representation. Meanwhile, OIC-EKE and the EMK had just completed its convergence and presented their own candidacy, that obtained 2,962 votes (1.17% of the total). In the Navarrese elections of April 1979 UNAI got even poorer results than in the previous election date, with 7,419 votes (2.92%); however, the organization got an MP for the merindad of Tudela, Jesus Casaj√∫s. Meanwhile, EIA, this time as Euskadiko Ezkerra also in Navarre, was integrated in different coalitions: Basque Nationalists (with the PNV, Euskal Sozialistak Elkartzeko Indarra and the Party of Labour of Spain) in the merindad of Pamplona and inside Electoral Groups of Merindades (AMAIUR, along with HB and EMK) at Estella, Sang√ºesa and Olite. In Tudela and Pamplona the EMK promoted other candidates, ANAI and ANIZ, failing to gain any representation. The final results were 1 MP for UNAI, 3 for Basque Nationalists, 7 for AMAIUR and 9 for Herri Batasuna. Since 1982, when Euskadiko Ezkerra appeared as an official political party, UNAI disappeared from the Navarrese political landscape.

Club career Argentina Born in Merlo but raised in neighboring Marcos Paz, Ramos played his first senior football with Nueva Chicago. His best goal scoring seasons in Argentina were with Armenio while playing in the third tier, scoring 27 goals over two seasons. Chile Ramos signed for his first team abroad, San Marcos de Arica, ahead of their return season in Chile's Primera Divisi√≥n in 2014. He made three starts in the Apertura, scoring his first goal against Uni√≥n Espa√±ola on 3 August, but was not involved for the club's last seven games. Ramos was more involved in the Clausura, appearing in every game, making 12 starts and scoring 7 goals, including a brace against Espa√±ola. The club's 8th place finish was good enough to qualify for a 4-team playoff for the country's final continental bid. Ramos scored the equalizer in the second leg of their semi-final against Uni√≥n La Calera, sending the tie to penalties. Ramos scored in the victorious shootout, setting up a two-legged tie with Universidad Cat√≥lica. Ramos scored twice in the home leg at the Carlos Dittborn, but San Marcos ultimately fell short of their first continental appearance in a penalty shootout after the tie had finished 4‚Äì4 on aggregate. Platanias Ramos played one season in Europe, playing for Platanias in Greece in the 2015‚Äì16 season. He appeared in 25 games for the Cretan club; 12 from the start and 13 off the bench. Ramos tallied four goals as well. After the season, Ramos returned to Argentina, playing for Atlanta in the third tier. His 13 goals were fourth in the league as Atlanta finished in third, bowing out of the promotion playoffs in the quarterfinals. Japan Ramos joined Renofa Yamaguchi FC in July 2017, halfway through the club's campaign in the Japanese second tier, the J2 League. Playing under Argentinian manager Carlos Mayor, Ramos made his debut on 29 July, scoring a goal off the bench against Yokohama FC. Ramos finished his first and only season in Asia with 7 goals in 17 games, and he made the move to Mexico for the first time after the season. Cafetaleros de Tapachula Ramos joined Cafetaleros de Tapachula of Ascenso MX ahead of their Clausura campaign in 2018. Having scored twice in Copa MX, Ramos scored his first goals in the league in his second start, netting a hat trick against Celaya on 4 February. He did not score in his next four games, but four goals in four games in March helped Tapachula sneak into the play-offs in 8th position. Ramos scored six goals in the Liguilla, including three in the quarterfinals against first place Zacatecas, and the only goal of the home leg of the final against UdeG. Tapachula beat UdeG 3‚Äì2 over two legs in the final, winning the first title in their history. Ineligible for promotion, Tapachula did play a promotion final against Oaxaca for prize money. Ramos scored the first goal of a 5‚Äì1 first leg victory, and the club won the prize money from would-be relegated Lobos BUAP. =Lobos BUAP (loan)= Ramos joined Lobos BUAP on loan at the end of August, halfway into Apertura 2018. After a period of regaining fitness, Ramos was inserted into the squad, and scored on his debut, against Pumas UNAM on 16 September. His goal the following week against Le√≥n gave the club their second win of the campaign, and also made Ramos their first player with multiple goals. Ramos scored twice the following week against Morelia in a 3‚Äì1 victory, and he scored a goal in his next three games. His first game for Lobos without a goal was on 4 November, against Tijuana. Ramos finished with 8 goals, good for sixth, despite only playing in 9 games. Ramos began the Clausura with 4 goals in 3 games, highlights by a brace inside 10 minutes against Necaxa in a 3‚Äì2 defeat on 20 January. Ramos finished the season with 8 goals in 14 appearances, missing the month of March with injury. As Lobos's center- forward, Ramos scored 16 goals in 23 appearances, finishing joint-third, behind Andr√©-Pierre Gignac and Julio Furch. After the season, Lobos BUAP sold their license in Liga MX to FC Ju√°rez, and Ramos was forced to find a new team. Le√≥n Ramos joined Club Le√≥n, runners-up of the previous tournament, ahead of Apertura 2019, after his previous club were removed from the league. Ramos debuted for Le√≥n on 20 July, scoring the final goal of a 3‚Äì1 victory over Pachuca, having come off the bench to replace center forward Jos√© Juan Mac√≠as.

Little is known about his life. He died shortly before his father and was never duke himself. The name of Henry's wife is not known, though both Sibylla and Cl√©mence have been suggested. The first of these derives from an undated obituary from Besan√ßon, Sainte-Etienne, naming \\"Sibilla, mater ducus Burgundie\\" (Sibylla, mother of the Duke of Burgundy) (possibly ), it being reasoned that since she is not called duchess, she must have been married to the sole father of a duke who was not a duke himself, Henry. However, it has been argued by Jean Richard that this is a reference to Sibylla of Burgundy, Duchess of Burgundy, mother of the then- ruling duke, Hugh II. Richard proposed based on the name's repeated use among the descendants of her son Odo I, Duke of Burgundy that she may have been named Cl√©mence,Richard, Jean (1958). \\"Sur les alliances familiales des ducs de Bourgogne aux XIIe et XIIIe si√®cles\\".

He has been an interpreter and translator of the work of major 20th century historians, notably Marc Bloch and Lucien Febvre, co-founders of the journal Annales and the associated Annales School. He has also translated Fernand Braudel and has explored and popularized the work of Lucie Varga, the first woman member of the Annales group of historians. Sch√∂ttler has taught at different German and Austrian Universities and at the √âcole des hautes √©tudes en sciences sociales (EHESS). In 1990/91 he was a member at the Institute for Advanced Study et in 1996/97 a Visiting Fellow at Princeton University. Since 2008 he is a Visiting Scholar at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science in Berlin. At the 1998 Deutscher Historikertag Sch√∂ttler, G√∂tz Aly and Michael Fahlbusch were involved in the debate concerning the role of German historians during the Third Reich. The trio suggested that Theodor Schieder, Werner Conze and Karl- Dietrich Erdmann were complicit with the Nazi regime rather than inwardly withdrawn intellectually through inner emigration.

At the end of its life, the mill had three paper machines, with a combined annual production of 373,000 tonnes of newsprint and 153,000 tonnes specialized papers. The mill was established by Crown Zellerbach in 1952 as the first newsprint mill on Vancouver Island. This was made possible through the construction of hydroelectric generating stations on the Campbell River. Crown Zellerbach was bought by Fletcher Challenge in 1981, becoming Crown Forest Industries. It merged in 1987 to form Fletcher Challenge Canada. This was again bought by Norske Skog in 2000 and became part of their Canadian division, which became Catalyst Paper in 2005. Elk Falls Mill was closed in 2010 due to diminishing demand for newsprint. It is the site of Island Generating Station, a natural gas-fired fossil-fuel power station.

It stars Ryan Gosling as a jazz pianist and Emma Stone as an aspiring actress, who meet and fall in love while pursuing their dreams in Los Angeles. John Legend, Rosemarie DeWitt, Finn Wittrock, and J. K. Simmons also star. Having been fond of musicals during his time as a drummer, Chazelle first conceptualized the film alongside Justin Hurwitz while attending Harvard University together. After moving to Los Angeles in 2010, Chazelle wrote the screenplay but did not find a studio willing to finance the production without changes to his design. Following the success of his 2014 film Whiplash, the project was picked up by Summit Entertainment. Filming took place in Los Angeles from August to September 2015, with the film's score composed by Hurwitz and the dance choreography by Mandy Moore. La La Land premiered at the 73rd Venice International Film Festival on August 31, 2016, and was released in the United States on December 9, 2016. It grossed $446 million worldwide against a production budget of $30 million. La La Land was praised for Chazelle's screenplay and direction, Gosling and Stone's performances, the musical score, musical numbers, visuals, cinematography, and production design. It won a record-breaking seven awards from its seven nominations at the 74th Golden Globes and received eleven nominations at the 70th British Academy Film Awards, winning five awards, including Best Film. It also received a record-tying fourteen nominations at the 89th Academy Awards, winning in six categories, including Best Director for Chazelle and Best Actress for Stone. Plot While stuck in Los Angeles traffic, aspiring actress Mia Dolan has a moment of road rage with Sebastian Wilder, a struggling jazz pianist. After a hard day at work, Mia's subsequent audition goes awry when the casting director takes a call during an emotional scene. That night, Mia's roommates take her to a lavish party in the Hollywood Hills, promising her that someone in the crowd could jump-start her career; after her car is towed, she has to walk home in disappointment. During a gig at a restaurant, Sebastian slips into a jazz improvisation, despite warnings from the owner to only play traditional Christmas pieces. Mia overhears him playing as she passes by. Moved, she enters the restaurant to witness Sebastian being fired for his disobedience. As he storms out, Mia attempts to compliment him, but he brushes her off. Months later, Mia runs into Sebastian at a party where he plays in a 1980s pop cover band. After the gig, the two walk to their cars and lament wasting a lovely night together despite the clear chemistry between them. Sebastian arrives at Mia's workplace, and she shows him around the Warner Bros. backlot, where she works as a barista, while explaining her passion for acting. He takes her to a jazz club, describing his passion for jazz and his desire to open his own club. Sebastian invites Mia to a screening of Rebel Without a Cause and she accepts, forgetting a commitment with her boyfriend Greg. Bored with the latter date, she goes to the theater and finds him as the film begins. The two conclude their evening with a romantic visit to the Griffith Observatory. After more failed auditions, Mia decides, with Sebastian's encouragement, to write a one-woman play. Sebastian begins to perform regularly at a jazz club, and the two move in together. Sebastian's former classmate Keith invites him to be the keyboardist in his jazz fusion band, where he will enjoy a steady income. Although dismayed by the band's pop style, Sebastian signs on after overhearing Mia trying to convince her mother that Sebastian is working on his career. The band finds success, but Mia realizes that this is not the type of music Sebastian wants to perform. During the band's first tour, Mia and Sebastian have an argument. She accuses him of abandoning his dreams, while he claims that she liked him more when he was unsuccessful. Two weeks later, Sebastian misses Mia's play due to a photo shoot he had forgotten about. The play does not go well as planned, as a few people attend, and Mia overhears dismissive comments about her performance. Unwilling to forgive Sebastian for missing the play and their previous argument, Mia ends their relationship and moves back home to Boulder City. Sebastian receives a call from a prominent casting director who attended Mia's play and invites her to audition for an upcoming film. Sebastian drives to Boulder City and persuades Mia to attend. During the audition, Mia is asked simply to tell a story. In response, Mia sings a story about how her aunt, a former theater actress who eventually died of alcoholism, inspired her to chase her dreams. Sebastian, confident the audition was a success, encourages Mia to devote herself to acting. The two profess that they will always love each other but are uncertain of their future together. Five years later, Mia is a famous actress and married to another man, David, with whom she has a daughter. One night, the couple stumble upon a jazz bar. Noticing the logo she had once designed, Mia realizes that Sebastian has opened his own club. When Sebastian notices Mia in the crowd, he begins to play their love theme on the piano. A dream sequence unfolds in which the two imagine what might have been had their relationship thrived alongside their careers. Mia shares a poignant smile with Sebastian, then leaves with her husband.  Cast  Cast list adapted from Fandango.  Production   Pre-production  Damien Chazelle first conceived the idea for the film while attending Harvard University with Justin Hurwitz, the film's composer. As a drummer, Damien Chazelle has a predilection for musical films. He wrote the screenplay for La La Land in 2010, when the film industry seemed out of reach for him. His idea was \\"to take the old musical but ground it in real life where things don't always exactly work out,\\" and to salute creative people who move to Los Angeles to chase their dreams. He conceived the film when he was a student at Harvard University with his classmate Justin Hurwitz. The two explored the concept in their senior thesis through a low-budget musical about a Boston jazz musician, Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench. Chazelle was moved by the tradition of 1920s city symphony films, such as Manhattan (1921) and Man with a Movie Camera (1929), that paid tribute to cities. After graduating, both moved to Los Angeles in 2010 and continued writing the script, but made a few modifications, such as altering the location to Los Angeles instead of Boston. Rather than trying to match L.A. to the charms of Paris or San Francisco, he focused on the qualities that make the city distinctive: the traffic, the sprawl, and the skylines. The style and tone of the film were inspired by Jacques Demy's The Umbrellas of Cherbourg and The Young Girls of Rochefort, especially the latter, which was more dance and jazz-oriented. The film also makes visual allusions to Hollywood classics such as Broadway Melody of 1940, Singin' in the Rain, The Band Wagon, and An American in Paris. About An American in Paris, Chazelle commented: \\"That's a movie that we just pillaged. It's an awesome example of how daring some of those old musicals really were.\\" It shares some character development and themes with Chazelle's previous musical work, Whiplash; Chazelle said: : \\"They're both about the struggle of being an artist and reconciling your dreams with the need to be human. La La Land is just much less angry about it.\\" He said that both films reflect his own experiences as a filmmaker working his way up the Hollywood ladder. La La Land in particular is inspired by his experience of moving from the East Coast with preconceived notions of what L.A. would be like, \\"that it was all just strip malls and freeways.\\" Chazelle was unable to produce the film for years as no studio was willing to finance an original contemporary musical, with no familiar songs. It is also a jazz musical, which The Hollywood Reporter called an \\"extinct genre\\". He believed that since he and Hurwitz were unknown at that time, it might have made financiers dubious about the project's potential. Chazelle found producers through friends who introduced him to Fred Berger and Jordan Horowitz. With the two producers on board, the script went to Focus Features at a budget of around $1 million. The studio demanded alterations: the male lead was asked to be changed from a jazz pianist to a rock musician, the complicated opening number had to be altered, and the story's bittersweet ending needed to be dropped. Chazelle scrapped the project and moved on. Chazelle later wrote Whiplash, which was an easier concept to sell and a less risky investment. After Whiplash was well received by critics upon its premiere at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival in January, Chazelle continued his efforts to bring La La Land to the big screen. A year later, when Whiplash earned five Oscar nominations at the 87th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and grossed nearly $50 million worldwide off a $3.3 million production budget, Chazelle and his project began to attract attention from studios. Five years after Chazelle wrote the script, Summit Entertainment and Black Label Media, along with producer Marc Platt, agreed to invest in La La Land and distribute it. They had been impressed by the critical and commercial success of Whiplash. Lionsgate's Patrick Wachsberger, who previously had worked on the Step Up franchise, pushed Chazelle to increase the film's budget since he felt high-quality musicals could not be made cheaply.  Casting  Initially, Miles Teller and Emma Watson were slated to star as the leads. Watson dropped out because of a commitment to the 2017 musical adaptation of Beauty and the Beast, while Teller departed via long contract negotiations. Conversely, Gosling turned down a role as the Beast in Beauty and the Beast in favor of La La Land. Chazelle decided to make his characters somewhat older, with experience in struggling to make their dreams, rather than younger newcomers just arriving in Los Angeles. Emma Stone plays Mia, a struggling actress in Los Angeles. Stone has loved musicals since she saw Les Mis√©rables when she was eight years old. She said \\"bursting into song has always been a real dream of mine\\", and her favorite film is the 1931 Charlie Chaplin romantic comedy City Lights. She studied pom dancing as a child, with a year of ballet. She moved to Hollywood with her mother at the age of 15 to pursue a career, and struggled constantly to get an audition during her first year. When she did, she often was turned away after singing or saying just one line. Stone drew from her own experiences for her character of Mia, and some were added into the film. tap dancing and piano for his role. She met Chazelle in 2014 while she was making her Broadway debut in Cabaret. Chazelle and Hurwitz saw her perform on a night when the actress had a cold. She met with Chazelle at Brooklyn Diner in New York City, where the director outlined his vision for the planned film. Stone gained confidence from performing in Cabaret to handle the demands of the film. In preparation for her role, Stone watched some of the musical movies that inspired Chazelle, including The Umbrellas of Cherbourg and Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers collaborations. Stone accepted the offer because Chazelle was so passionate about the project. Ryan Gosling plays Sebastian, a jazz pianist. Like Stone, Gosling drew from his own experiences as an aspiring artist. One incident was used for Mia. Gosling was performing a crying scene in an audition and the casting director took a phone call during it, talking about her lunch plans while he was emoting. Chazelle met with Gosling at a bar near the latter's home in Hollywood Hills, when Gosling was about to begin filming for The Big Short. Chazelle cast the two immediately after Summit bought the film. He said the two \\"feel like the closest thing that we have right now to an old Hollywood couple\\" as akin to Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn, Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, and Myrna Loy and William Powell. The film marked the third collaboration between Gosling and Stone, following Crazy, Stupid, Love (2011) and Gangster Squad (2013). Chazelle asked the two about their audition disasters when they were both trying to make it. Both learned how to sing and dance for the film's six original tunes. The rest of the cast ‚Äì J. K. Simmons, Sonoya Mizuno, Jessica Rothe, Callie Hernandez, Finn Wittrock, Rosemarie DeWitt, John Legend, Jason Fuchs, Meagen Fay ‚Äì were announced between July and August 2015. Legend plays Keith, a long-time friend of Sebastian. The film was choreographed by Mandy Moore. Rehearsals took place at a production office in Atwater Village, Los Angeles over the span of three to four months, beginning in May 2015. Gosling practiced piano in one room, Stone worked with Moore in another, and costume designer Mary Zophres had her own corner of the complex. Gosling, with no previous experience, had to learn how to play the piano, as no hand models were used. Moore emphasized working on emotion rather than technique, which Stone said was key when they filmed the Prius car scene. To help his cast and crew get their creative mode flowing, Chazelle held screenings on the soundstages every Friday night of classical films that had inspired him for the film, including The Umbrellas of Cherbourg, Singin' in the Rain, Top Hat, and Boogie Nights. Filming From the beginning, Chazelle wanted the film's musical numbers to be filmed \\"head to toe\\" and performed in a single take, like those of the 1930s works of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. He also wanted the film to emulate the widescreen, CinemaScope look of 1950s musicals such as It's Always Fair Weather. Consequently, the movie was shot on celluloid film (not digitally) with Panavision equipment in CinemaScope's 2.55:1 aspect ratio, but not in true CinemaScope as that technology is no longer available. Chazelle wanted Los Angeles to be the primary setting for his film, commenting that \\"there is something very poetic about the city I think, about a city that is built by people with these unrealistic dreams and people who kind of just put it all on the line for that.\\" Principal photography on the film officially began in the city on August 10, 2015, and filming took place in more than 60 locations both in and near Los Angeles, including the Angels Flight trolley in downtown, houses in the Hollywood Hills, the Colorado Street Bridge, the Rialto Theatre in South Pasadena, the Warner Bros. studio lot, the Grand Central Market, Hermosa Beach's Lighthouse Caf√©, Griffith Observatory, Griffith Park, Chateau Marmont, and the Watts Towers, with many scenes shot in one take. It took 40 days to complete shooting, finishing in mid-September 2015. The opening pre- credits sequence was the first to be shot, and was filmed on a closed-off portion of two carpool direct connector ramps of the Judge Harry Pregerson Interchange, connecting the I-105 Carpool Lane to the I-110 Express Lanes, leading to Downtown Los Angeles. It was filmed in a span of two days, and required more than 100 dancers. For this particular scene, Chazelle wanted to give a sense of how vast the city is. The scene was originally planned for a stretch of ground-level highway, until Chazelle decided to shoot it in the 105‚Äì110 interchange, which arcs in the air. Production designer David Wasco said, \\"I thought somebody was going to fall off and get killed.\\" Not every portion of the highway was blocked. Chazelle compared the scene to the yellow brick road leading to the Emerald City in The Wizard of Oz (1939). The Angels Flight (pictured), which was shut down for about four years, including at the time of the filming, was re-opened for a single day exclusively for the film to shoot a scene. Chazelle scouted for \\"old L.A.\\" locations that were in ruins, or were perhaps razed. One such example was the use of the Angels Flight trolley, built in 1901. The funicular had been closed in 2013 after a derailment. Attempts were made to repair and re-open the railway, but to no avail. However, the production team was able to secure permission to use it for a day. Chazelle and his crew then arranged to have it run for shooting (it was re-opened to the public in 2017). Mia works at a coffee shop on the Warner Bros. studio lot; Chazelle considered studio lots to be \\"monuments\\" of Hollywood. Production designer Wasco created numerous fake old film posters. Chazelle occasionally created names for them, deciding to use the title of his first feature, Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench (2009) for one poster, which reimagines it as a 1930s musical. The six-minute-long Prius car scene had to be completed during the brief \\"magic hour\\" moment at sunset. It took eight takes and two days to shoot it. When Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone finally nailed it, \\"everybody just exploded,\\" Stone said. Since Gosling and Stone were not primarily dancers, the two made a number of mistakes, especially during long uninterrupted single-take musical numbers. However, Chazelle was very sympathetic towards them, understanding their lack of experience and not minding their errors. While shooting Sebastian and Mia's first dance together, Stone stumbled over the back of a bench, but picked right up and kept on going with the scene. The argument during the romantic dinner that Sebastian prepared for Mia was one of the scenes that was re-written more than any other. Gosling and Stone also helped create the dialogue of the scene to get it to be one of the more realistic scenes in a film filled with fantasy and fantastical elements. Chazelle spent nearly a year editing the film with editor Tom Cross, as the two were primarily concerned with getting the tone right.  Music  The songs and score for La La Land were composed and orchestrated by Justin Hurwitz, Chazelle's Harvard University classmate, who also worked on his two prior films. The lyrics were written by Pasek and Paul, except for \\"Start a Fire\\", which was written by John Legend, Hurwitz, Marius de Vries and Angelique Cinelu. A soundtrack album was released on December 9, 2016, by Interscope Records, featuring selections from Hurwitz's score and songs performed by the cast.  Release  La La Land had its world premiere as the Venice Film Festival's opening night film on August 31, 2016. The film also screened at the Telluride Film Festival, the Toronto International Film Festival, beginning September 12, 2016, the BFI London Film Festival, the Middleburg Film Festival in late October 2016, the Virginia Film Festival, held at the University of Virginia on November 6, 2016, and the AFI Fest on November 15, 2016. The film was originally set for a July 15, 2016, release; however, in March 2016, it was announced the film would be given a limited release starting December 2, 2016, before expanding on December 16, 2016. Chazelle stated that the change was because he felt that the release date was not right for the context of the film, and because he wanted to have a slow rollout beginning with the early fall film festivals. The film was later pushed back a week to December 9, 2016, with the wide release still being planned for December 16, 2016. Lionsgate opened the film in five locations on December 9, 2016, and expanded it to about 200 theaters on December 16, 2016, before going nationwide on December 25, 2016. The film went fully wide on January 6, 2017, with a release into select IMAX theaters a week later. La La Land was released in the United Kingdom on January 12, 2017. The film was released in the Netherlands on December 22, 2016, and in Australia on December 26, with the rest of the territories planned for a release from mid-January 2017.  Home media  Lionsgate released La La Land on Digital HD on April 11, 2017, and Blu-ray, Ultra HD Blu-ray and DVD on April 25, 2017. Reception  Box office  La La Land grossed $151.1 million in the United States and Canada and $295 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $446.1 million, against a production budget of $30 million. Deadline Hollywood calculated the net profit of the film to be $68.25 million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues for the film, making it one of the top 20 most profitable releases of 2016. La La Land began its theatrical release with a limited release in five theaters in Los Angeles and New York City on December 9. It made $881,107 in its opening weekend, giving the film a per-theater average of $176,221, the best average of the year. In its second week of limited release, the film expanded to 200 theaters and grossed $4.1 million, finishing 7th at the box office. It was an increase of 366% from the previous week and good for a per-theater of $20,510. The following week, the film had its wide expansion to 734 theaters, grossing $5.8 million for the weekend (including $4 million on Christmas Day and $9.2 million over the four days), and finishing 8th at the box office. On January 6, 2017, the weekend of the Golden Globes, the film expanded to 1,515 theaters and grossed $10 million over the weekend, finishing 5th at the box office. In its sixth week of release, the film grossed $14.5 million (a total of $16.9 million over the four-day weekend for Martin Luther King Jr. Day), finishing 2nd at the box office behind Hidden Figures. After receiving its 14 Oscar nominations, the film expanded to 3,136 theaters on January 27, 2017 (an increase of 1,271 from the week before) and grossed $12.1 million (up 43% from its previous week's $8.4 million). During the weekend of February 24‚Äì26 (the weekend of the Academy Awards) the film grossed $4.6 million, exactly the same amount it grossed the previous weekend. The next week, following its six Oscar wins, the film grossed $3 million.  Critical response  Critics praised the film's screenplay, direction, acting, score, and the chemistry of Gosling and Stone. The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 91% based on 458 reviews, with an average rating of 8.65/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"La La Land breathes new life into a bygone genre with thrillingly assured direction, powerful performances, and an irresistible excess of heart.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 94 out of 100, based on 54 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". It was the third- and sixth-highest scoring film released in 2016 on each respective site. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"A‚Äì\\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported audiences gave an 81% overall positive score and a 93% \\"definite recommend\\". Stone received critical acclaim for her performance, and would go on to win the Academy Award for Best Actress. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave La La Land four stars out of four, describing it as \\"a hot miracle\\" and complimenting its musical numbers, particularly the opening scene. He went on to name it his favorite movie of the year. Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune similarly lauded the opening sequence, in addition to highlighting Stone's performance, stating \\"she's reason enough to see La La Land.\\" Despite being less enthusiastic about Gosling's dancing and the film's middle section, Phillips nevertheless gave the film four out of four stars, declaring it \\"the year's most seriously pleasurable entertainment\\". A.O. Scott of The New York Times praised the film, stating that it \\"succeeds both as a fizzy fantasy and a hard-headed fable, a romantic comedy and a showbiz melodrama, a work of sublime artifice and touching authenticity\\". Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian awarded the film five out of five stars, describing it as \\"a sun-drenched musical masterpiece.\\" Tom Charity of Sight & Sound stated, \\"Chazelle has crafted that rare thing, a genuinely romantic comedy, and as well, a rhapsody in blue, red, yellow and green.\\" Writing for The Boston Globe in December 2016, Ty Burr summarized the effectiveness of the film to relate to audiences stating: \\"...the movie traffics in the bittersweet happiness of treasuring things that are vanishing, like the unrealized future imagined in the climactic dance number, or those inky, star-filled dance floors that go on forever in old movies, or Hollywood musicals themselves. Or jazz: Sebastian has an early moment at a nightclub where he passionately sticks up for the music he loves. 'It's dying on the vine,' he says. 'And the world says 'Let it die. It had its time.' Well, not on my watch.' In that scene, he speaks for the director. By the end of 'La La Land,' he's speaking for all of us.\\" The film was criticized by some for its treatment of race and jazz. Kelly Lawler of USA Today noted that Gosling's character has been referred to as a \\"white savior\\" by some critics, due to \\"his quest (and eventual success) to save the traditionally black musical genre from extinction, seemingly the only person who can accomplish such a goal.\\" The sentiment was also expressed by Ruby Lott-Lavigna of Wired, Anna Silman of New York, and Ira Madison III of MTV News. Rex Reed of the New York Observer also took aim at the film's intention to emulate the MGM musical classics, writing that \\"the old-fashioned screenplay, by the ambitious writer- director Damien Chazelle, reeks of mothballs\\", and that \\"the movie sags badly in the middle, like a worn-out mattress that needs new springs\\". The South China Morning Post remarked that aside from its racial treatment of jazz, much of the public criticism was towards the film being ‚Äúa little dull‚Äù, the two leads' singing and dancing being considered unexceptional, and the lack of nuance in Stone's character, with Gosling's occasionally seen as insufferable.  Accolades  Hurwitz, Chazelle, and Stone at the Mill Valley Film Festival in October 2016 La La Land received eleven nominations at the 70th British Academy Film Awards, more than any other film of 2016.

At the 89th Academy Awards, La La Land received a leading six awards, including Best Director, Best Actress (for Stone), Best Cinematography, Best Original Score, Best Original Song (\\"City of Stars\\"), and Best Production Design. The film received a total of 14 nominations, tying the record for most nominations by a single film with All About Eve (1950) and Titanic (1997). Its other nominations were Best Picture, Best Actor (for Gosling), Best Original Screenplay, Best Film Editing, Best Costume Design, a second nomination for Best Original Song (\\"Audition (The Fools Who Dream)\\"), Best Sound Editing, and Best Sound Mixing. =Best Picture Oscar gaffe= During the Oscars ceremony, presenter Faye Dunaway incorrectly announced that La La Land had won Best Picture, reading from the card Warren Beatty opened, which was actually a duplicate of the Best Actress card for Emma Stone. After the cast and crew of La La Land took the stage, it took the show's producers more than two minutes and nearly three speeches to fix the mistake. The actual winner was Moonlight. =German television prank= In March 2017, La La Land was at the center of a prank involving Goldene Kamera, an annual German film and television award. German comedians Joko Winterscheidt and Klaas Heufer-Umlauf arranged for a Ryan Gosling impersonator to be awarded the \\"Best International Film\\" prize for La La Land. Following the event, a speaker for television broadcaster ZDF asked for the trophy to be given back, stating that La La Land had won the prize and that the trophy would be given to the real Ryan Gosling. The incident, which became known as \\"GoslingGate\\", sparked criticism of the event's concept. Media critics argued that the \\"Best International Film\\" award had only been created in an effort to get Ryan Gosling on the show, with no regards for the movie's quality. The incident played a major role in the cancelation of the Goldene Kamera in 2019. In 2018, Winterscheidt and Heufer-Umlauf were awarded the Grimme Award for their media criticism.

Her short story \\"The Sack\\" won the 2015 Caine Prize for African fiction in English. In 2020, Serpell was the winner in the Belles-lettres category Grand Prix of Literary Associations 2019, for her debut novel The Old Drift.\\"GPLA 7TH Edition: Winners Announced\\", Bamenda Online, 29 July 2020. Biography Early years and education Namwali Serpell was born in 1980 in Lusaka, Zambia, to Robert Serpell and his wife. Her British-Zambian father is a professor of psychology at the University of Zambia, and her mother is an economist. When she was nine, her family moved to Baltimore, Maryland, in the United States, where Serpell was educated. She completed her undergraduate degree in literature at Yale and her doctorate (PhD) in American and British fiction at Harvard. Career Since 2008 she has lived in California, where she is an associate professor of English at the University of California, Berkeley. She returns to Lusaka for visits annually. Her short story \\"Muzungu\\" was shortlisted in 2010 for the Caine Prize, an annual award for African short fiction in English. In 2011, she received the Rona Jaffe Foundation Writers' Award, a prize for beginning women writers. Her story \\"The Sack\\" won the Caine Prize in 2015. Serpell, saying \\"fiction is not a competitive sport\\", announced she would share the $15,000 prize with the other shortlisted writers, Masande Ntshanga, F. T. Kola, Elnathan John, and Segun Afolabi. Serpell was the first Caine winner from Zambia. The \\"sack\\" of the title, according to Serpell, derives from a terrifying dream she had at 17, \\"and I didn't know if I was on the inside or the outside\\". It also has political implications: \\"I was studying American and British fiction, and [another graduate student] was studying African contemporary fiction, and her theory was that any time you saw a sack in African literature, it was a hidden reference to the transatlantic slave trade. I was kind of writing my story against that.\\" In 2014 she published Seven Modes of Uncertainty, a critical work that examines \\"the relationship between literature's capacity to unsettle, perplex, and bewilder us, and literature's ethical value\\".\\"Namwali Serpell launches '7 Modes of Uncertainty'\\", Africa39, 18 May 2014.

Such sundials were particularly common between the 7th and 14th centuries in Europe, at which point they began to be replaced by mechanical clocks. There are more than 3,000 surviving tide dials in England and at least 1,500 in France. Name The name tide dial preserves the Old English term ', used for hours and canonical hours prior to the Norman Conquest of England, after which the Norman French hour gradually replaced it. The actual Old English name for sundials was ' or \\"day-marker\\". History The tide dial at St Michael & All Saints' in Coningsby, Lincolnshire, UK The tide dial in Strasbourg Jews long recited prayers at fixed times of day. Psalm 119 in particular mentions praising God seven times a day,Ps. 119:164.. and the apostles Peter and John are mentioned attending afternoon prayers.Acts 3:1. Christian communities initially followed numerous local traditions with regard to prayer, but Charlemagne compelled his subjects to follow the Roman liturgy and his son Louis the Pious imposed the Rule of StBenedict upon their religious communities. The canonical hours adopted by Benedict and imposed by the Frankish kings were the office of matins in the wee hours of the night, Lauds at dawn, Prime at the 1st hour of sunlight, Terce at the 3rd, Sext at the 6th, Nones at the 9th, Vespers at sunset,. and Compline before retiring in complete silence.. Monks were called to these hours by their abbot. or by the ringing of the church bell, with the time between services organized in reading the Bible or other religious texts, in manual labor, or in sleep. The need for these monastic communities and others to organize their times of prayer prompted the establishment of tide dials built into the walls of churches. They began to be used in England in the late 7th century and spread from there across continental Europe through copies of Bede's works and by the Saxon and Hiberno-Scottish missions. Within England, tide dials fell out of favor after the Norman Conquest.. By the 13th century, some tide dials‚Äîlike that at Strasbourg Cathedral‚Äîwere constructed as independent statues rather than built into the walls of the churches. From the 14th century onwards, the cathedrals and other large churches began to use mechanical clocks and the canonical sundials lost their utility, except in small rural churches, where they remained in use until the 16th century. There are more than 3,000 surviving tide dials in England. and at least 1,500 in France,. mainly in Normandy, Touraine, Charente, and at monasteries along the pilgrimage routes to Santiago de Compostella in northwestern Spain. A sundial beside the priests' door at SSMary & Lawrence's in Stratford Toney, England Design With Christendom confined to the Northern Hemisphere, the tide dials were often carved vertically onto the south side of the church chancel at eye level near the priest's door. In an abbey or large monastery, dials were carefully carved into the stone walls, while in rural churches they were very often just scratched onto the wall. Some tide dials have a stone gnomon, but many have a circular hole which is used to hold a more easily replaced or adjusted wooden gnomon. These gnomons were perpendicular to the wall and cast a shadow upon the dial, a semicircle divided into a number of equal sectors. Most dials have supplementary lines marking the other 8 daytime hours, but are characterized by their noting the canonical hours particularly. The lines for the canonical hours may be longer or marked with a dot or cross. The divisions are seldom numbered. Dials often have holes along the circumference of their semicircle. As additional gnomons were needless and these holes are often quite shallow, Cole suggests they were used to quickly and easily reconstruct the tide dials following a fresh whitewash of the church walls with chalk or lime. Examples Bewcastle Cross The oldest surviving English tide dial is on the 7th- or 8th-century Bewcastle Cross in the church graveyard of St Cuthbert's in Bewcastle, Cumbria. It is carved on the south face of a Celtic cross at some height from the ground and is divided by five principal lines into four tides. Two of these lines, those for 9am and noon, are crossed at the point. The four spaces are further subdivided so as to give the twelve daylight hours of the Romans. On one side of the dial, there is a vertical line which touches the semicircular border at the second afternoon hour. This may be an accident, but the same kind of line is found on the dial in the crypt of Bamburgh Church, where it marks a later hour of the day. The sundial may have been used for calculating the date of the spring equinox and hence Easter.Bewcastle: A Brief Historical Sketch.\\"Bilberries and Tickled Trout: Reflections on the Bewcastle Cross\\".

In July 2015, Bradley was listed by the Louisiana Secretary of State as a registered Republican voter. Background Bradley is the son of Clifford Bradley, Sr., of DeRidder and the former Clotilde Hooks (1923-2012), a daughter of the late Ruth Holly and Dayton Hooks of Emerson in Columbia County in south Arkansas. His mother, who was active in the First Baptist Church of DeRidder, is interred at Beauregard Cemetery. Bradley has three sisters, Julia Anderson and husband Ken of Westlake in Calcasieu Parish; Mary Ruth Corley and husband Roy of Austin, Texas, and Patrice Cason and husband Joe of DeRidder. His only brother, Robert Allen Bradley, was born and died on January 23, 1942. Bradley graduated in 1973 from Southeastern Louisiana University in Hammond and in 1976 from Louisiana State University Law Center in Baton Rouge. Bradley is married to the former Catherine Theresa \\"Cathy\\" Gregorio, originally from Bossier City, the daughter of a Roman Catholic couple, the late Agnes Sardisco Gregorio and Sam Anthony Gregorio (1924-2014), a native of Natchitoches Parish and the owner for forty years of Airline Food Market. He was a member and president of the Bossier Parish Police Jury, the Greater Bossier Economic Development Foundation, and the Bossier Optimist Club. He was a charter member of St. Jude Catholic Church and was active in the Knights of Columbus and the Immaculate Conception Society. He was a United States Army veteran of World War II. The Bradleys have two sons, Brent Allen Bradley and Brian Anthony Bradley, and a daughter, Erin Elizabeth Bradley. \\"Louisiana: Bradley, Allen\\", Who's Who in American Politics, 2003-2004, 19th ed., Vol. 1 (Alabama-Montana) (Marquis Who's Who: New Providence, New Jersey, 2003), p. 770 Career Bradley practiced law in DeRidder, served on the city council from 1978 to 1981 and was chairman of his local hospital board of directors. He is Southern Baptist and has been affiliated with the American Red Cross, the Chamber of Commerce, the Masonic lodge, and Lions International. He won the first of his two legislative terms in the nonpartisan blanket primary held on October 22, 1983, when he unseated fellow Democrat Eldridge L. Morris, also of DeRidder, 4,518 votes (54.2 percent) to 3,816 (45.8 percent). In that same election Democrat Edwin Edwards reclaimed the governorship from Republican David C. Treen. He was unopposed in his reelection bid in 1987. Bradley served on the House Education and Agriculture committees and was in his second term the chairman of the House Committee on Civil Law and Procedure. He was also a member of the Louisiana Bond Commission. In 1991, rather than seeking a third term in the House, Bradley ran unsuccessfully for the District 30 seat in Louisiana State Senate (Beauregard, Calcasieu, Sabine, and Vernon parishes) against his fellow state representative, Democrat and later Republican James David Cain of Dry Creek in Beauregard Parish. Cain received 17,527 votes (55.7 percent) to Bradley's 13,947 (44.3 percent). The seat opened with the retirement of Senator Bryan A. Poston of Hornbeck in Vernon Parish. Reflecting on his legislative career, Bradley said that his education on: > how government really works [came] during those two [legislative] terms. I > had the opportunity to work with some remarkable leaders and the very > competent legislative staff. I think I was most surprised ... to find that > lobbying firms provide needed research and background on proposed > legislation.

There are other > states that have addressed [issues from which we can learn] ... > It strikes me now, looking back on it, that the legislative process was > much more congenial and collegial than it is today. There was not much > Republican versus Democrat infighting and partisanship, it was really about > issues at the time that I served.

Legislators generally reflect the collective > personalities of their districts. Serving in Baton Rouge gives one a keen > appreciation of the cultural diversity in our state. Understanding that > diversity helps one understand the perspective of a given geographical area > ... Bradley said that party labels in Louisiana \\"quite frankly, ... don't make as much sense as they do in other places. Most Democrats in Louisiana would qualify for Republicans almost anywhere else.\\" Immediately after leaving the legislature, he resided in Metairie in Jefferson Parish for two years. From 1994 until his retirement in April 2015, Bradley was affiliated with the firm AMERISAFE, a company involved in workers' compensation insurance and based in DeRidder. He began as the executive vice president of the company and was named chief operating officer in 2003.

The Nizhny Novgorod tram network (–ù–∏–∂–µ–≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥—Å–∫–∏–π —Ç—Ä–∞–º–≤–∞–π) (formerly Gorky tram network) comprises 16 tramlines and uses a standard Russian broad gauge. Trams have been operating in Nizhny Novgorod since 1896, but services were interrupted for a few years following the 1917 Russian Revolution. Internet rumours that the city tram network was to be progressively run down surfaced a few years ago: they were emphatically and officially denied. History Three tram companies The history of trams in Nizhny Novgorod begins with an informal competition involving three companies. On 15 May 1895 the firm Hartmann & Co signed a contract with the city to build two lines. Later in the summer of the same year Siemens & Halske also concluded a contract. A third company building a tramline was Podobedow & Co. Siemens won the race, with a tramline ready for use on 20 May 1896 Sources using the \\"old\\" (pre-1918 in the case of Russia) quasi-Julian calendar identify 20 May 1896 as 8 May 1896. and formally opened on 21 June. This line, which led to the showground being used for the vast All-Russia Exhibition, was closed down again after the exhibition ended in October. However, a year later, after the tracks and overhead power lines had been removed, the line was reconstructed, except that it now stopped slightly short of the former exhibition site. It was also on 21.June 1896 that Hartmann & Co opened their two Metre gauge lines both of which linked Minin-Pozharsky (–ú–∞–ª–æ–π –ü–æ–∫—Ä–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–º) Square with what has since been renamed Gorky Square. However, the two lines followed different routes. There was a line through the upper town (Grand Kremlin / citadel) and a line through the lower (river shore level) town. Together they therefore formed a closed \\"circle\\" tramline, except that at the end points the altitude differences were far too extreme for a continuous line: for passengers/pedestrians the terminus stations were therefore connected using large elaborate elevators (lifts), known as the Kremlewski Elevator and the Poklavinsky Elevator. The third of the companies, Podobedov & Co., already had experience of constructing a temporary \\"on-ice\\" tram line at St. Petersburg, and they brought their expertise to Nizhny Novgorod for a 750 mm narrow gauge line serving the 1896 exhibition site itself. The vehicles included a special tramcar for the Royal family. Crossing the river and an ownership changes in 1897 It was not till 16 June 1897 that Siemens built the first tram crossing of the Oka River, using a pontoon bridge. This was as part of a broad gauge line linking the city's Moscow line terminus with what is today known as Skobe. Initially the Siemens line over the bridge was extended along the right bank of the Oka, but this ran parallel with the Hartmann & Co \\"lower town\\" line near the river shore and the Siemens extension was dismantled by order of the city authorities. In 1897 the Hartmann & Co system was renamed \\"Russian Company for electric trams and lighting\\" (\\"–†—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–º—É –æ–±—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤—É —ç–ª–µ–∫—Ç—Ä–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö –¥–æ—Ä–æ–≥ –∏ —ç–ª–µ–∫—Ç—Ä–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –æ—Å–≤–µ—â–µ–Ω–∏—è\\", known today as Nizhegorodelektrotrans / –ù–∏–∂–µ–≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥—ç–ª–µ–∫—Ç—Ä–æ—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω—Å). The original contracts concluded in 1895 had always identified the city as the owner of any tramlines, but they had included the right for Hartmann to lease the concession to operate the trams for 35 years. The name change marked the point where Hartmann sold this concession back to the city. The next year the Siemens & Halske concession also passed to the Russian company, after which the \\"Russian Company for electric trams and lighting\\" became Nizhny Novgorod's monopoly tram operator till 1908. Further expansion and a single gauge standard In 1901 the line connecting Pochvalinski und Ostrohnaya opened, followed in 1902 by the line between Kremlevsko and Monastyrnya. The line in the \\"upper town\\" was extended to . The decision was taken in 1910 to standardise the gauge, using the Broad gauge that had already become standard across most of the Russian rail network. The work was completed in 1923, and was also applied to the rails of the horse tram that had operated between 1908 and 1918. Years of war and revolution On 8 October 1914 the municipality purchased the \\"Russian Company for electric trams and lighting\\" (\\"–†—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–º—É –æ–±—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤—É —ç–ª–µ–∫—Ç—Ä–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö –¥–æ—Ä–æ–≥ –∏ —ç–ª–µ–∫—Ç—Ä–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –æ—Å–≤–µ—â–µ–Ω–∏—è\\" for 1.2 Million rubles. Disruption following the 1917 Russian Revolution and the Civil War led to the suspension of operations on 1 May 1919. The trams only started to run again on 3 August 1923. A unified network, some new trams and further expansion Four years later, on 10 October 1927, the \\"upper town\\" and \\"lower town\\" networks were finally linked up. This left the city with a connected tram network of . At this stage, however, the tramcars themselves were still based the original ones acquired when the system was set up. In 1930 the city purchased 30 new tramcars from the Mytishchi factory (today the Metrowagonmash company) on the north-eastern edge of Moscow. Another 24 tramcars followed in 1932. 1930 was also the year in which the city, in collaboration with the Michigan based Ford Motor Company, started work on what would become the giant GAZ Car plant, then known as the Nizhegorodsky Avtomobilny Zavod and later known for producing Volga cars as well as a huge number of commercial and military vehicles. In 1932 the plant produced its first passenger car, a Ford Model A according to western sources, and on 1 April 1933 the factory received its own (approx) tram connection with the rest of the city network. As a result of this and other projects, by 1935 the Gorky tram network had grown to . War War returned, between the Soviet Union and Germany in June 1941, and most of the tram workers were conscripted into the army: their places were taken by women. Another feature of the period was a widespread shortage of fuel for heating and energy, and it was necessary to switch off heating in the tramcars. However, none of the nine significant air-raids that the city suffered during the German invasion damaged the tram network. Postwar expansion followed by more choices for passengers  The 1950s and 1960s were years of expansion. By 1960 a further of lines had been constructed, and the network was now organised into 18 routes. The total network in 1965 extended to . The system was further enhanced in 1968 with a new larger tram depot. Later in the 1960s competition from buses increased. Investment in new tramlines stopped, and a project already underway to build a new tram bridge across the Oka River was not completed. Competition for investment intensified in 1977 when work began on the city metro system, and competition for passengers on the busiest lines intensified further after 1985 when the first stretch of Metro line became operational. From the mid-1980s there was nevertheless a return to tram investment, but following the economic challenges posed by the Perestroika revolution, there was also an increased emphasis on efficiency. A reconfiguration of the network followed in 1992 which reduced the number of operational tramcars needed. Today Today the Nizhny Novgorod tram network employs around 5,000 people and 387 tramcars across a network of approximately . In order to help the system's financial position almost all the tramcars carry advertising. To keep costs down, employees paint advertisements on the tramcars by hand.

Caldas is best known as part of Brazil's Neo-Concretism movement as well as for his eclectic choices in materials.  Early life and education  Caldas was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, the son of Diva Caldas (n√©e Fialho) and Waltercio Caldas, a civil engineer. Due to his father's occupation, Caldas has stated that from a young age he was surrounded by drawings and scale models. In the early sixties, Caldas had his first amateur exhibition showing at the Student‚Äôs Council of the Philosophy Course at Rio de Janeiro State University. And in 1964, Caldas began studying under Ivan Serpa at the Museum of Modern Art, Rio de Janeiro.  Career   Early work (1960s ‚Äì 1980s)  Caldas completed his first graphic project in 1965 and in the late 1960s first started experimenting with perception and enigmatic sculptures. In the early seventies, Caldas also started creating drawings and box object such as The Seven Stars of Silence (1970), Centre of Primitive Reason (1970), and You are Blind (1972) which drew critical acclaim including from Gilberto Chateaubriand. In 1973, Caldas exhibited his first solo show at the Museum of Modern Art, Rio de Janeiro which he was widely commended for. Writer, Ronaldo Brito wrote about the exhibition and commented that Caldas' work encouraged the viewer to not just look at the art, but contemplate it as well as it evoked a moment of \\"psychic bewilderment\\" in the viewer. Also at this time, Caldas edited Malasartes, a short-lived magazine that became a landmark in the Brazilian artistic scene and taught \\"Art and Visual Perception\\" at the Villa- Lobos Institute. In the 1980s, Caldas started to create more facilities in his work. Caldas moved to New York in 1985 where he experimented with non- transparent sculpture material. Caldas then returned to Brazil the following year where he showed two shows simultaneously in both Rio de Janeiro and S√£o Paulo that paralleled each other and emphasized the idea of \\"double intrinsic.\\" In 1989, Caldas installed its first public sculpture: The Instant Garden in Carmo Park, S√£o Paulo.  Later work (1990s ‚Äì present)  In 1990, Caldas exhibited his first solo show in Europe, drawings at the Pulitzer Gallery in Amsterdam. Caldas then completed his second public commission sculpture, Omkring (Around), in 1994, which is now on permanent display in Leirfjord, Norway. The sculpture was classified as \\"line articulation\\" and commended for countering lightness with tension. Recognition In 1990, Caldas was awarded the Brasilia Art Award at the Brasilia Museum of Art which also led to the museum incorporating pieces from Caldas into its collection. In 1993, Caldas' solo show, The Finest Air, was exhibited at the Fine Arts National Museum in Rio de Janeiro, which was awarded the Mario Pedrosa Award and named the Best Show of the Year in Brazil by the Brazilian Art Critics‚Äô Association. In 1998, Caldas was named a Johnnie Walker Award recipient and presented a sculpture to be permanently displayed at the Museu de Arte Moderna da Bahia.

A German immigrant, his military career spanned thirty-one years, from 1863 to 1894, during which he also saw action in the American Civil War. He also served a tour of duty in the United States Marine Corps. After retirement from the military, he became a merchant.

He fought Cochise and the Chiricahua Apaches during a battle at Rocky Mesa in the Chiricahua Mountains on October 20, 1869, earning the Medal of Honor for Gallantry in Action. This engagement was caused by an earlier attack (October 5) on a stagecoach that killed two civilians and four soldiers traveling as passengers to Tucson, Arizona and an attack on a group of cowboys in the Sulphur Springs Valley by Apache Indians.McChristian, Douglas C.

Above and Beyond: A History of the Medal of Honor from the Civil War to Vietnam. Boston: Boston Publishing Company, 1985. (pg. 325) U.S. Medal of Honor version given from 1862 to 1895 A detachment of 66 men of the 1st Cavalry Regiment and 61 men of Company G under Lieutenant John Lafferty of the 8th Cavalry had tracked the Apaches into the Chiricahua Mountains and eventually to an engagement what some called the \\"Campaign of the Rocky Mesa.\\" The combined troops were led by Captain Reuben F. Bernard of the 1st Cavalry. The cool overcast day became \\"a miserable day, cold with rain and hail, when the cavalrymen attacked.\\" The Apaches were well entrenched and defending behind rocks and boulders near the top of a ridge. The soldiers had to climb a defile or a steep-sided and narrow passage of loose slick rocks to go over and around as they moved up toward the top of the mesa. More than one fell due to the weather conditions. Under these deplorable conditions Schroeter and his fellow soldiers advanced upwards toward the hostile Indians. Captain Bernard noted in his report: \\"These men are they who advanced with me up the steep and rocky mesa under as heavy a fire as I ever saw delivered from the number of men, Indians, say from one hundred to two hundred. These men advanced under this fire until within thirty steps from the Indians when they came to a ledge of rocks where every man who showed his head was shot at by several Indians at once. Here the men remained and did good shooting through the crevices of the rocks until ordered to fall back which was done by running from rock to rock where they would halt and return the fire of the Indians.\\"O'Neal, Bill.

(pg. 141) As darkness fell, Schroeter with other cavalrymen were ordered to withdraw. They did so in good order individually and in small groups taking their wounded with them down the dangerous slick slopes under enemy fire. Some would provide covering fire while others retreated a short distance, then the process would repeat. Schroeter's commanding officer, Lt. Lafferty, in trying to recover dead soldiers was shot in the mouth destroying his lower left jaw. The entire action cost a likely overestimated 15 to 18 Apache lives and two confirmed soldiers dead with about 4 or 5 (accounts differ) wounded troopers. Schroeter completed his first tour of duty as a private with F Company, 8th Cavalry Regiment on August 9, 1871, while at Fort Selden in New Mexico. 1871‚Äì1876 He was reenlisted by Captain Brown on October 7, 1871, at St. Louis, Missouri as a soldier. He is listed as being born at Hanover, Germany, now age 34. He description was noted as Hazel eyes, black hair and fair complexion with his height as 5 feet inches. The 1st Infantry Regiment campaigned against the Sioux in the 1870s while Schroeter was with them. He completed his second enlistment as a sergeant with C Company, 1st Infantry Regiment, while stationed at Fort Sully, Dakota Territory on October 7, 1876.

USS Alliance at anchor. Schroeter traveled to Washington, D.C., and on November 2, 1877, he was sworn into the United States Marine Corps. Private Schroeter reported aboard USS Alliance in March 1877. He was one of the 26 Marines aboard that screw gunboat. Deployed in Mediterranean Schroeter with his shipmates called at many ship ports for the next three years. Corporal Schroeter was discharged from the Marine Corps on November 2, 1881.At the same general time period, another \\"Charles Schroeter\\" joined the U.S. Army on May 27, 1878, while in New York City, New York. The information entered by Capt. Cheffield, shows his birth as in Saxony, Germany, Age 38, a merchant, with blue eyes, dark hair, ruddy complexion, and being 5 feet 3 inches high. This Charles Schroeter deserted on November 8, 1878, while at Jefferson Barracks. It appears the Schroeter of this article was a victim of identity theft. When Marine Private Schroeter went aboard the USS Alliance, she was a new ship built in 1875. She had been commissioned on January 18, 1877, with Commander Theodore F. Kane as captain. On March 9 she sailed to join the European Squadron with the mission of protecting American lives and property, and showing the American flag. The Alliance was based at Ville-franche, France, where, with the permission of the French Government, the United States maintained a supply depot. Soon after arrival in Europe, the Russo-Turkish War broke out, and Schroeter and his fellow ship mates were sent to Salonika, on the Greek coast, and thence to Smyrna. The duty was tedious and boring and discipline was maintained through a strict training regime. Close order drills, abandon ship drills, fire drills, repel boarder drills and cleaning and repairs occupied most of Schroeter's time over the next ten months. \\"Spit and polish\\" was often the mantra aboard such US Navy ships. USS Franklin In February 1878, the Alliance became Rear Admiral William E. Le Roy's flagship. The Alliance then sailed for Piraeus in Greece, the port for Athens. During ex-President Grant's stay in Greece the Alliance \\"rendered honors\\" to him on March 13. A few weeks later while at Piraeus, the ship received the King and Queen of Greece. They \\"remained a considerable time on board\\" aboard the Alliance which was the flagship for the US Navy flotilla. The King and Queen on their departure were \\"honored with the usual ceremonies as upon their arrival\\" on March 26. Whether Schroeter and his fellow Marines were impressed by such honored company is open to debate. The Alliance sailed from the Eastern Mediterranean to beyond the Western end into Algiers and back to Villefranche visiting ports along the way. She then repeated the process and such was the routine until late 1879. She reached Boston on December 8, 1879, then sailed for Norfolk the following day, arriving there on the 14th. For the next five months, the ship lay under repairs at Norfolk. Schroeter and the other Marines were sent ashore for other duties. Schroeter became a hospital guard until being assigned to the USRS Franklin. The Franklin had been a Civil War screw frigate until retired from active service on March 2, 1877. She was then recommissioned as a receiving ship, which was also known as a \\"barracks ship.\\" He was transferred to the Marine Barracks in Norfolk on October 24, 1881, where he was honorably discharged November 4, 1881, from the USMC.

Death and reburial Grave marker of Charles Schroeter - Medal of Honor- Section 3-1052 - Miramar National Cemetery In January 1921 Schroeter died aged 83 still living with the Hoopes (Hooper) family in San Diego. His will stated he wished his remains to be cremated and then interred locally under a pre-paid burial policy. A local Masonic Lodge (#35) held a memorial ceremony for him and placed a small obituary notice in the San Diego Union newspaper. No family members were found during a lengthy probate search conducted by the City that was closed in 1931, ten years after his death. More than a decade after his death, his remains were still not claimed. His cremains were placed in an unmarked pauper crypt with other unclaimed remains at Greenwood Memorial Park in San Diego. About 2005, the Congressional Medal of Honor Society, whose members are Medal of Honor holders, tasked its Foundation to find the graves of several hundred missing Medal of Honor recipients. The mission of the Congressional Medal of Honor Foundation is to promote the Medal of Honor legacy, values and what it stands for. Laura Jowdy, an archivist with the Congressional Medal of Honor Society, conducted the primary research on Schroeter. As did the Congressional Medal of Honor Society of the United States under Don Morfe. Jowdy is quoted as saying, about Schroeter and other missing Medal of Honor dead, \\"It's important for these brave individuals not to be forgotten.\\" Her research with the CMOHS on his service led the investigation to San Diego in 2010. Captain Bill Heard, USNR retired, the Miramar National Cemetery Support Foundation's Public Information Officer, with the Congressional Medal of Honor Society, conducted local research for the unmarked burial location. With assistance of the San Diego History Center archivist, Jane Kenealy, Schroeter's remains were found in an unmarked crypt at Greenwood Memorial Park. Don Morfe of the Medal of Honor Historical Society of the United States provided a \\"commemorative plaque to mark the location of the remains\\". Heard was then instrumental in convincing the National Cemetery Administration that the Charles G. Schroeter who died in 1921 was the same Charles Schroeter who received the Medal of Honor in 1870 for his actions in 1869. In 2013, that Foundation sent a Medal of Honor plaque to the cemetery for placement with his remains. Cemetery staff were unaware of they had a Medal of Honor recipient until that point of time. Following receipt of the plaque, Cathy Fiorelli, director of Greenwood Memorial Park who also serves on the board of the Miramar cemetery's foundation, decided that Schroeter should be buried at a national cemetery as it seemed \\"...more befitting, proper and appropriate as the final resting place for a war veteran and Medal of Honor recipient.\\" Miramar National Cemetery Foundation Director Charles Bailey submitted the first request to transfer the remains of Charles Schroeter. After providing more details and facts, the second formal request by Bailey was successfully submitted. Fiorelli then filed a request to transfer the remains to Miramar National Cemetery, which was approved. On July 8, 2015, Schroeter's remains were escorted from Greenwood Memorial Park to the new (dedicated 2010) Miramar National Cemetery by Patriot Guard Riders. The following day, July 9, 2015, a somber military ceremony took place as Schroeter was reburied with full military honors. A horse-drawn hearse carried his remains with an honor guard of thirty soldiers from the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment from Fort Irwin, California. Also present were flag bearing Patriot Guard Riders, two living Medal of Honor recipients, Civil War re- enactors, and an Army band with a few military and cemetery officials providing their respects. Standing in for the family, Douglas Ledbetter, Director of Miramar National Cemetery, was presented the American flag that covered Schroeter's remains.

He died on March 31, 2009, aged 82. He had lung cancer and died at his home; a massive candlelight vigil took place in the vicinity of it. Vice President Julio Cobos, the acting president at the time, arranged three days of national mourning and a state funeral at the Palace of the Argentine National Congress. Alfons√≠n was seen by 40,000 people and the senior politicians of the country; people from other countries also voiced their respect for him. A military escort took his coffin to the La Recoleta Cemetery, and left him at the pantheon for the veterans of the Revolution of the Park. Health and death Alfons√≠n had lung cancer for almost a year before his death, which led to pneumonia. His medic Alejandro Sandler explained that his health had worsened at several points, which were followed by brief recoveries. In his last days he was visited by vice president Julio Cobos and monsignor Justo Laguna, who gave him the Anointing of the Sick. He received home care, as Sandler preferred him to stay with his family. The president Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner was out of the country and phoned several times; Ricardo Alfons√≠n called her at 17:00 and informed her of his father's health. He died on March 31, 2009, at 20:30; Sandler announced it at 21:03. Alfons√≠n was sleeping at the moment, next to his family. Cobos was the first politician to arrive at his home. Funeral When the first news of the death of Alfons√≠n were released, the vicinity of his house at the Santa Fe avenue was filled by hundreds of people, who started a Candlelight vigil. The multitude included friends, neighbors and political supporters. The politicians Felipe Sol√° and Ricardo Gil Lavedra attended the meeting as well. The balconies of nearby houses were filled with flowers and banners. Procession in the Callao Avenue The president Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner was out of the country at the moment, and although she arranged an early return, she could not return to the country in time for the funeral. As a result, the vice president Julio Cobos arranged the state funeral of Alfons√≠n, alongside Eduardo Fellner (president of the Chamber of deputies) and Jos√© Pampuro (acting president of the Senate). His widow, former First Lady of Argentina Mar√≠a Lorenza Barreneche, was unable to attend her husband's public state funeral due to her own declining health. As a former Argentine president, his body was displayed at the Blue Hall of the Palace of the Argentine National Congress. He also set three days of national mourning, from March 31 to April 2. Daniel Scioli, governor of the Buenos Aires Province (birthplace of Alfons√≠n), also announced a provincial mourning. Almost a thousand people attended, and at some moments they sang the Argentine National Anthem. The people were allowed to enter to the Congress on April 1, 10:00. Initially, it was intended to keep the Congress open until 20:00, but the number of people attending it forced to delay it for the morning of April 2. The event was attended by the former presidents Carlos Menem, Fernando de la R√∫a, Eduardo Duhalde and N√©stor Kirchner, all the members of the Supreme Court of Argentina, mayor Mauricio Macri, governor Daniel Scioli, the president of Uruguay Tabar√© V√°zquez and several other politicians. The Congress was visited by almost 40,000 people. It was the largest state funeral in Argentina since the death of Juan Per√≥n in 1974. There was a ceremony afterwards with speeches from politicians from Alfons√≠n's tenure and from the Kirchner administration. The ceremony was aired in cadena nacional. It was followed by a mass given by Jos√© Mar√≠a Arancedo, archbishop of Santa Fe. Finally, a procession in the Callao Avenue with a military escort took the corpse to the La Recoleta Cemetery. People threw flowers to the coffin, fly Argentine and radical flags, and sung the national anthem. He was left in the pantheon for the veterans of the Revolution of the Park, until he got a special one for himself. Twenty-two Argentine bishops at the Holy See held a mass for Alfons√≠n as well. It was at the Archbasilica of St. John Lateran, and was attended by the Argentine ambassador Juan Pablo Cafiero, the Italian monsignor Giuseppe Laterza and the Argentine monsignor Guillermo Karcher. The bishops met Pope Benedict XVI the following day. Reactions Message of condolences sent by Barack Obama, president of the United States The living former presidents of Argentina sent their condolences for Alfons√≠n. Carlos Menem said that his death was a great loss for democracy. He also wrote an editorial for the La Naci√≥n newspaper, titled \\"Un viejo adversario saluda a un amigo\\" (), mirroring the famous quotation of the radical leader Ricardo Balb√≠n during the funeral of Per√≥n. Fernando de la R√∫a said that \\"he fought all his life for politics and democracy. He raised up the values of democracy. Respect and affection were always present in him\\". Eduardo Duhalde described him as a family friend, and said Argentina lost a great man. N√©stor Kirchner praised the trial of the Juntas. He also received condolences of Jos√© Sarney, Patricio Aylwin and Julio Mar√≠a Sanguinetti, contemporary presidents of Brazil, Chile and Uruguay. The governments of Brazil, Chile, Colombia, France, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, Spain, United States and Uruguay also sent messages of condolences. Ricardo L√≥pez Murphy, minister of economy of president Fernando de la R√∫a, said that Alfons√≠n was \\"the man who fought for our democracy and the strengthening of institutions, during a time of conflicts and polarizations that our society was merged into\\". Cristian Ritondo, legislator of the Republican Proposal, said that \\"Alfons√≠n was the main actor of the return of democracy to Argentina. He was a sinonym of work, responsibility and patriotism\\". Gerardo Morales said that \\"when we were young in 1983 and sang 'we are life, we are peace', it was more than a slogan, it was a synthesis of our hopes: do not suffer more persecutions, live in democracy, in freedom and peace. We were part of the collective project led by Alfons√≠n\\". Elisa Carri√≥ pointed that she had political disputes with him, but respected him nonetheless. Julio C√©sar Strassera, judge of the trial of the juntas, hoped that Alfons√≠n would be remembered as a great democrat. Daniel Scioli, governor of the Buenos Aires province, praised that he died with a complete peace of mind. Mauricio Macri, mayor of Buenos Aires, considered that he must have died in peace, after fulfilling his goals.

The battery in April 2016 left The battery has a pentagonal shape, and it contains a caponier, casemated gun emplacements, an escarpment and a ditch. An infantry redoubt was built at the rear of the battery. Some alterations were made to the structure between the 1890s and the first half of the 20th century. In 1888, when it was still under construction, the battery's design was criticized by a number of British engineers. The decision was taken to complete the battery, but it never received its intended armament of four 64-pounder RML guns. The entire Victoria Lines were of dubious defensive value, and the entire system of fortifications (with the exception of Fort Madalena and Fort Binƒ°emma) was decommissioned in 1907. The former battery was then used as a magazine or storage area, and it was used for training and storage by the Civil Defence just after World War II.

Company history and the Treblinka findings The original Dziewulski & Lange factory of Opoczno received recognition in relation to history of the Holocaust in occupied Poland. The tiles stamped with the D‚ú°L logo were unearthed in 2010 on the grounds of the former Treblinka extermination camp. An archaeological team performing excavations, led by Caroline Sturdy Colls of Staffordshire, explained that the evidence is of paramount importance, because the gas chambers at Treblinka were the only brick structure in the camp. The old Opoczno tiles provided the first physical proof for their existence. Survivor Jankiel Wiernik wrote in his Holocaust memoir before the end of war that the floors which he helped build, were made of such tiles. The discovery of ceramic bathroom tiles became the subject of the 2014 documentary Treblinka: Hitler's Killing Machine by the Smithsonian Channel. One of the tiles found during the archaeological dig, providing the first physical evidence for the existence of the gas chambers at Treblinka The tiles from Opoczno found at Treblinka were erroneously perceived as featuring a Star of David. Further analysis by Polish scientists led to the discovery of the true origins of the star identified as the historic trademark of the company which made the Treblinka tiles. The theory of the Star of David was therefore put to rest.Katarzyna Markusz, Odkrycie w Treblince (The discovery at Treblinka).

Quote in translation from Dziennik.pl: The most interesting find of the archeologists were the tiles used in the building of the old gas chambers. Two tiles were found. It has been known since several days that the tiles came from the ceramics factory Dziewulski i Lange of Opoczno. Edward Kop√≥wka, who is probably the world's leading expert on Treblinka, said the following: 'Although the tiles display a Star of David they were produced by a Polish factory, later taken over by a German Volksdeutsche.\\" Polish original: \\"Najciekawsze odkrycie archeolog√≥w to kafelki, kt√≥rymi wyko≈Ñczone by≈Çy tzw. stare komory gazowe.

Even though all Treblinka tiles display a logo, it is not known what the meaning of the star might have been. Lange is not a Slavic surname. Once established, the logo remained in use during the interwar period. The foundry survived the 1939 invasion of Poland and remained in private hands until 1949. During the darkest years of Stalinism in Poland it was appropriated by the state and renamed. Only after the Treblinka discovery, the star became the subject of intense scrutiny; described as the mullet of six points, pierced 12px similar to a Star of David. Archeological assessments published by Staffordshire in the period following the Smithsonian documentary no longer identified the logo as Jewish in origin, an issue of central importance previously. Treblinka extermination camp built by Nazi Germany in occupied Poland during World War II operated between , and , as part of Operation Reinhard, the most deadly phase of the Final Solution. During this time, between 700,000 and 900,000 Polish Jews were killed in its gas chambers disguised as shower-rooms complete with ceramic bathroom tiles. More victims were gassed at Treblinka than at any other Nazi extermination camp apart from Auschwitz.

Built environment  The main settlement in Wadi Hauran is Ar-Rutbah, an Iraqi town and seat of Ar-Rutba District. Its name means 'wet land' in Arabic because it can receive 114.3 mm of rain per year. Its total current population is 22,370 inhabitants, all of them Arabs and Sunnis. People earn their living by agriculture and small business.

Formed in 1920, it fought both in the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War and the Invasion of Poland. The regiment was garrisoned in the town of Rowne, Volhynia, and in 1939 belonged to Volhynian Cavalry Brigade. Wo≈Çy≈Ñska BK w 1938  Beginnings  The regiment was formed in July 1920, during the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War, as the 11th Mounted Border Rifles Regiment (11 Pulk Konnych Strzelcow Granicznych). Its cadre consisted of NCOs, trained at two military schools, in Ciechan√≥w and Stara Wies near Warsaw. Due to efforts of Colonel Bronislaw Zaniewski, who commanded the Border Rifles, a cavalry regiment was created, based on the NCOs from both schools. On July 24, 1920, NCO's from Ciechan√≥w, commanded by Bohdan Dabrowski, arrived at Stara Wies, and Dabrowski himself was appointed commandant of the whole regiment. In early August 1920, Colonel Aleksander Kunicki arrived at Stara Wies. His task was to form four squadrons and a platoon of heavy machine guns. On August 7, the regiment was placed under authority of the military governor of Warsaw, who ordered it to march towards Radzymin and then Stara Milosna, on August 8, 1920. The Vistula Uhlans fought with distinction in the Battle of Warsaw (1920). On August 16, 1920, the regiment was transported by rail to Kutno, and then marched off to P≈Çock. As Polish offensive had begun, the regiment crossed the Vistula near Wyszogr√≥d (August 20), chasing after the retreating Soviet cavalry of Hayk Bzhishkyan. Unable to escape Polish encirclement, Soviet forces entered East Prussia near Kolno. By early September 1920, the regiment was stationed near Ciechan√≥w, and on September 17, it was ordered to march to Pruszk√≥w near Warsaw, where it remained until September 27, when it was moved by rail to Sok√≥≈Çka, to fight the Lithuanians, who supported the Soviets in the Battle of the Niemen River. On October 5, the regiment captured Ejszyszki, and on October 14, it was ordered to protect the rail line from Grodno to Wilno. Since a number of Soviet and Lithuanian soldiers remained in local forests, the regiment had to fight them almost daily. On October 20, 1920, the unit was named 21st Vistula Uhlan Regiment, and was ordered to guard Polish‚ÄìLithuanian demarcation line. It continued this service until January 15, 1921, when it was moved to Woronowo. On March 2, 1921, the regiment moved to the villages in the area of Baranowicze, and in the summer 1921, it was transferred again, to Horodziej. Finally, in early September 1921, the unit was loaded on a train, and transported to Rowne, where it remained until 1939. In March 1921, Polish military authorities decided to name the regiment after the Vistula river, as it claimed to continue the traditions of the Legion of the Vistula, which fought in the Napoleonic Wars. During the 1939 Invasion of Poland, the unit was part of Wo≈Çy≈Ñska Cavalry Brigade, fighting in the Battle of Mokra, the Battle of Ostrowy and the Battle of Wola Cyrusowa. After losing 85% of its manpower, the regiment ceased to exist by September 10, 1939. Its elements managed to get to the besieged Warsaw, where they continued fighting.

These temples, according to the Indian Trust for Rural Heritage and Development (ITRHD), were built between the 17th and 19th centuries. The kings of Baj Basanta dynasty built these temples in Maluti, their capital, inspired by goddess Mowlakshi, their family deity. Many of the temples are deified with different denominations of gods and goddesses, apart from the tutelary deity Mowlakshi, and others such as Shiva, Durga, Kali and Vishnu. The Global Heritage Fund (GHF) has proposed a conservation effort, which would increase tourism to the Maluti village. GHF has declared this site as one of the world's 12 most endangered cultural heritage sites. Location Maluti temples The extant Maluti terracotta temples are 72 which were built in four groups in Maluti near the border between Jharkhand and West Bengal. The Chila river flows through the village and meets the Dwarka river, close to Tarapith. Rampurhat, in Birbhum, West Bengal is the nearest railway station to the temple complex. Trains operate from Calcutta. Bus services operate from Rampurhat and also from Dumka. The distance from Maluti to Dumka, the district headquarters, is , and Rampurhat to Maluti is . History Maluti Temple Temples in Maluti, jharkhand History of these temples is directly linked to the gift of the kingdom of Maluti, then known as \\"Nankar Raj\\" (meaning: tax- free kingdom\\"), that was granted to a Brahmin named Basanta by the Muslim ruler Alauddin Husain Shah of Gaura (1495‚Äì1525) for having saved his hawk (Baj) and returning it to him. Consequently, Basanta was given the suffix Raja and called Raja Baj Basanta. As Basanta was a religious person, he preferred building temples instead of palaces. Subsequently, his family divided into four clans and they continued to build the temples in Maluti, their capital, in clusters, inspired by goddess Mowlakshi, their family deity. The name Maluti is said to be derived from Mallahati, the Malla Kings of Bankura. The Indian Trust for Rural Heritage and Development (ITRHD), has dated the building of these temples between the 17th and 19th centuries. The Maluti temples were not known to the outside world until A.K.Sinha, Director of Archaeology, Government of Bihar, publicized them, for the first time in 1979. Features Initially there were 108 temples built in the village, within a radius of , all dedicated to Lord Shiva. Of the 108 temples, only 72 still stand, but in a semi-dilapidated condition; the other 36 temples have been lost. Many of the temples are deified with different denominations of gods and goddesses, apart from the tutelary deity Mauliksha, and others such as Shiva, Durga, Kali and Vishnu. Bamakhyapa's Temple Apart from the Shiva temples, there are also eight temples dedicated to Goddess Kali. There is a temple dedicated to a saint known as Bamakhyapa where his trident has been deified. Another important temple is that of Manasa Devi. The family deity of the Baj Basanta dynasty is goddess Mauliskha which is widely worshiped and devotees visit the Mauliskha temple all through the year; the goddess is deified facing west and is said to be the elder sister of goddess Tara. The temples, designed in different styles, which were then popular throughout Bengal, by the artisans from Bengal, are grouped under five categories and none of them are in the architectural styles of the Nagara, Vesara or Dravida. According to Mc Cutchion, these temples were built to the Cara-cala design which consists of a square chamber \\"surmounted internally by a dome built over pendentives\\" with corbelled cornices which give the appearance of a hut-shaped roof. The temples have been decorated with sculptures of episodes from the epic Mahabharata and Ramayana, and the fight between Durga and Mahishasura. Scenes of village life are also carved at some locations of the temples. There are a few inscriptions also on the temples which give details of building of the temples and also on the socio-political history of that period. These are inscribed and dated as \\"shaka era\\" (Indian national calendar), in early Bengali script which is a combination of Sanskrit, Prakrit and Bengali. Conservation Square chambered hut type temples in a semi ruined condition The first steps taken to conserve the Maluti temples were taken by an NGO called \\"Save Heritage and Environment (SHE)\\". They approached the Global Heritage Fund (GHF) to provide support. The Global Heritage Fund (GHF) and the Indian Trust for Rural and Heritage Development instituted a study to prepare plans for the conservation of the Maluti temples. The study identified each temple's conservation details and the threats to the temple structures. The report also indicated the names of international organizations which could provide funds and expertise for such restoration whilst retaining the traditional characteristics of the terracotta tiled sloping roofs of the temples. It recommended that this activity should be carried out by \\"strengthening the local community through education, awareness and a greater stake in the conservation process\\". The GHF has now included the temples and the village among \\"the world‚Äôs twelve vanishing cultural heritage sites\\". Maluti is the lone representative from India on GHF's list of \\"the world‚Äôs twelve vanishing cultural heritage sites\\".

Sir Frederick Roberts led the Kabul Field Force over the Shutargardan Pass into central Afghanistan with twenty field guns and 7,500 men, including infantry, cavalry, artillery, and sappers and miners. Roberts's force moved up the Kurram Valley, winning various skirmishes and receiving envoys from Ayub Khan denying responsibility for the murders.

These altered behaviours may occur consciously or unconsciously. Origin of concept The term rape schedule was first used in 1984 in Dianne Herman‚Äôs essay \\"Rape Culture.\\" included in _Women: A Feminist Perspective_ Reprint of \\"The Rape Culture\\" from Women: A Feminist Perspective (3rd. edition, Jo Freeman, Mountain View, CA: Mayfield, 1984) and _Changing Our Power_ Changing Our Power 260 (J.W. Cochran & D. Langton eds., 1988)(J.W. Cochran & D. Langton eds., 1988). It was later made popular by Jessica Valenti, through her book Full Frontal Feminism.Valenti, Jessica. Full Frontal Feminism: A Young Woman's Guide to Why Feminism Matters. Seal Press, (2007). 63 The concept has since been cited and discussed by feminist scholars across disciplines, including criminologist Jody Miller, lawyer Catharine Mackinnon, and philosopher Susan Griffin. These individuals have speculated on the impact of rape schedule on women‚Äôs freedom, access to rights, relationships with others, and self worth.Catharine A MacKinnon, Sex Equality, Foundation Press (2007) 339Stephen R. Gold's review of: Sex, Power, Conflict: Evolutionary and Feminist Perspectives, Edited by David M. Buss and Neil M. Malamuth. Oxford University, Press, New York, 1996 as cited in 'Theories of Rape' http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/vaw00/theories_of_rape.html.  Background   Statistical context  Statistical analysis based on victim reporting can be used to demonstrate the prevalence of sexual assault in the United States. According to the 2015 National Crime Victimization Survey, on average, 321,500 people aged 12 or older in the US are raped or assaulted each year. Among this population, women are more likely to be raped than men: 1 in 6 women will experience an attempted or completed rape in their lifetime, compared with 1 in 33 men. 91% of victims of rape and sexual assault are female. These statistics are also influenced by sexuality: *46.4% of lesbian women and 40.2% gay men; *74.9% of bisexual women and 47.4% bisexual men; *and 43.4% of heterosexual women and 20.8% heterosexual men have reported experiencing some form of sexual violence in their lifetime, according to the National Sexual Violence Resource Center. Age also influences rates of sexual assault. For example, when compared with the overall national average for women, women aged 18-24 who are college students are three times as likely to be victims of sexual assault; women in the same age group that are not attending college are four times as likely to experience sexual assault. Rape is one of the most underreported crimes in America.  Privilege  A privilege is a right or advantage granted to a specific population that is not allowed to others. In a sociological model, privilege (sociology) outlines the ways that these advantages are results of larger societal systems and demonstrative of social inequality. Examples of privilege can be found through the lenses of: *Gender identity *Class *Sexuality *Race *Age *Ability *Religion *Occupation These lenses of privilege can be applied in considering the use of rape schedule. For example, Jody Miller has explained that prostitutes cannot adhere to a rape schedule as it would leave them 'unable to work'-- adhering to a rape schedule in this manner could be seen to be 'born of privilege'.Jody Miller, \\"Researching Violence Against Street Prostitutes: Issues of Epistemology, Methodology, and Ethics\\" in Researching Sexual Violence Against Women: Methodological and Personal Perspectives (Martin D. Schwartz ed., 1997). 144, 150.  Effects   Fear  Fear of sexual assault is a commonly shared sentiment among many individuals in today's society, especially women. Rape schedule dictates that this fear often forces individuals to make alterations within their everyday life, shifting routines and limiting activity to conform with a level of invisibility that will provide protection. Examples of this behavior includes taking specific routes home, being indoors by specific hours of the night, avoiding going places alone, or dressing in a specific manner. Here, fear functions as both a cause and effect.  Mental and emotional impact  In the 1970s, a term known as Rape Trauma Syndrome was introduced by Ann Wolbert Burgess and Lynda Lytle Holmstrom. Rape can lead to mental health disorders, such as PTSD, and statistical evidence demonstrates this trend. According to Dean G. Kilpatrick, from the National Violence Against Women Prevention Research Center, 31% of all rape victims develop some form of PTSD at some point in their lifetime and those who were victims of rape were ‚Äú6.2 times more likely to develop PTSD than women who had never been victims of crime\\". Victims were also three times more likely than those who had not been sexual assaulted to experience a major depressive episode, 13.4 times more likely to have two or more major alcohol problems, and 26 times more likely to have two or more serious drug abuse problems. Because of these severe incidents, women develop rape schedules to help them try to avoid the possibility of rape occurring in the future. As a result of these fear-based rape schedules, women can be left feeling powerless, which can have an extremely debilitating impact on women‚Äôs self-worth.  Vulnerability  Despite adherence to any form of rape schedule, women are not guaranteed safety from the threat of sexual assault. Despite precaution, they can still be left and feel vulnerable, a phenomenon largely experienced by women and less universally by men. In an informal survey mentioned by Mary Dickson in her article, \\"A Woman's Worst Nightmare\\", many men reported that they do not feel fear when walking down the street. A man stated \\"as a man, I'm afraid of very little.\\" However, in that same survey, women listed numerous things they feared. One female responded, \\"I'm always afraid in a situation where there's somebody that could overpower me easily. I lock my doors, park in lighted areas, don't run in dark areas.\\" This informal survey suggests that especially in these particular situations, women feel a great deal more vulnerable than men.

The ship was launched 1 August 1911 as Peralta but renamed before completion. As a foreign built vessel operating for a company in the United States the ship was British flagged. With outbreak of war in Europe in 1914 the ship, as did all British registered company ships, changed flag to the United States. Between 5 July 1918 and 25 April 1919 the ship was chartered and commissioned by the United States Navy for operation as USS Tivives Tivives resumed service with the United Fruit Company until World War II when she was operating as a War Shipping Administration vessel with United Fruit Company as agent and sunk on 21 October 1943 off the Algerian coast by German aircraft. Construction Peralta was built by Workman, Clark & Company, Ltd. for the Tropical Fruit Steamship Company of which Andrew W. Preston, the president and director of United Fruit Company was chairman and director, and launched 1 August 1922 at Belfast but renamed Tivives before completion. The ship was built to the highest class of the British Corporation Registry of Shipping and to the standards of the British Board of Trade and the United States Steamship Passenger Inspection Service. Passenger accommodations included some cabins that could become family suites and several \\"cabins de luxe\\" on the bridge deck. The cargo space was divided into eight refrigerated compartments. Propulsion was by a triple expansion steam engine provided steam by five single ended boilers. On 28 October the Tivives departed Belfast for sea trials and then put in at Holyhead to embark passengers for her voyage to the West Indies and commencement of regular service from the United States. Early commercial service Tivives was one of three new ships, the others being Carrillo and Sixaola, to begin service 6 January 1912 between New York and Limon, Costa Rica by way of Jamaica and Panama. The ship's Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships entry speculates the name was \\"probably coined by the United Fruit Co. from the Spanish words 'ti' and 'viveres' and roughly translated as \\"your food.\\" It is as likely United Fruit, which knew the area intimately and did use geographic names for its ships, named the ship after a geographical location associated with Costa Rica such as the village of Tivives or the historical bay of Tivives. The ship, part of United Fruit's \\"Great White Fleet,\\" had spacious passenger accommodations that were air conditioned and cabins with temperature regulated by the passenger down to 55¬∞ Fahrenheit (12.8 C) for twenty-four day cruises with a day in Jamaica and three in Panama. In 1914, with the outbreak of war in Europe, Congress passed a law allowing foreign registered, foreign built ships belonging to United States companies to shift registry to the United States flag which the United Fruit Company had long wished to do, had sought a special act of Congress to do, but had failed. With the new law United Fruit began its fleet transition with Tivives being the first ship to shift from British registry and hoist the U.S. flag on 10 September 1914 at Boston. World War I service On 5 July 1918 Tivives was chartered and commissioned by the United States Navy as USS Tivives at New York and assigned to the Naval Overseas Transportation Service. On 13 July the refrigerated ship, loaded with beef and trucks, joined a convoy for France reaching Gironde on 28 July then discharged cargo the next day at St. Nazaire. Tivives joined a homeward bound convoy 15 August at Verdon reaching New York on 26 August where she again loaded beef sailing 2 September bound for unloading cargo at Rochefort. On 30 September the ship was again homeward bound, arriving 13 October, to pick up and deliver another cargo of beef reaching Verdon 6 November with the armistice being signed while the ship was unloading. Returning to New York the ship made two more voyages with beef to Europe and military equipment on the return between Christmas 1918 and final return to New York 27 March 1919 and being decommissioned on 25 April. The Navy identification number ID-4521 was assigned years after the ship's actual Naval service. Return to commercial service Tivives was returned to United Fruit Company and resumed commercial service. In 1933 the company let contracts for reconditioning five ships including Tivives which was to get upgrades to passenger facilities and an increase in speed from to . World War II On 29 May 1942 Tivives was delivered to the War Shipping Administration (WSA) at New Orleans by United Fruit Company which then operated the ship as agent under an Army Transportation Corps charter agreement until 12 September when the agreement was changed to a WSA general agency form to operate as a WSA vessel. The ship was in convoy MKS 28 on 21 October 1943 and about 15 miles off Cape T√©n√®s, Algeria, when the convoy came under attack by German aircraft strafing and torpedoing Tivives which quickly sank with the loss of one of the 48 man civilian crew and one of the 25 man Naval Armed Guard. Survivors, including the six man staff of the convoy commodore and one passenger were rescued by the Free French-manned corvette .

He leads the vocal chorus through 33 familiar items and he has a way that makes it easy to join along.‚Äù Billboard liked it. \\"Of course, this is imitation, as are so many of the recent sing- along sets, but it is a first-rate one due to the presence of the old master, Bing Crosby.

History It was one of Lusaka's earliest squatter settlements. By the late 1960s, many of Kalingalinga's residents were lured to Chainama Hills (later renamed \\"Mtendere\\"), a newly opened development that promised \\"water, good roads, schools, and a clinic\\". Those who left for Chainama Hills were mostly supporters of president Kaunda's UNIP, leaving behind a population with considerable support for the opposition Northern Rhodesian African National Congress. By the late 1970s, assistance from the Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Internationale Zusammenarbeit in the form of a major urban upgrading project provided a school, water, street lighting, and other necessities, such as loans and legal assistance in applying for land ownership. According to a report by the United Nations Human Settlements Programme, by 1991 the urban upgrading of Kalingalinga \\"enabled 4400 low-income squatter households to obtain improved houses, services and security of tenure\\". It noted, on the political situation, that progress initially had been slow because the population mostly supported the political opposition, but also that local organizations had been quite effective in the initiation, planning, and execution of the improvements. An overview of the project, which was completed in 1987 and supported until 1992, is provided by the World Bank Group. On the difference in status between inhabitants of Kalingalinga and other townships, former Minister of Foreign Affairs Katele Kalumba, who had been instrumental in implementing policies ostensibly designed to clean up the townships but which in reality mainly harassed the poor, said \\"Whose town is it? It appears that if you live in Woodlands, Kabulonga, and so on, you are the town owners, and if you live in Kaunda square or Kalingalinga or places like this, you are simply strangers in the city who can be moved and resettled somewhere\\". Government and challenges Self-regulation in Kalingalinga proved difficult at times, though it has served as a model for the development of the administration of other townships; the Kalingalinga community proved it could organize for the common good, even at the expense of immediate personal gain. For instance, when it became accepted to use the locally abundant laterite (rather than cement blocks) to build houses, many inhabitants began digging up the soil to build their own houses and to sell on the market, thereby harming the soil and disturbing the drainage of rainwater; the soil was no longer used to grow vegetables on. The problems exacerbating, the community decided to ban the digging for laterite in the settlement itself, and a neighboring site was opened where locals could dig up laterite for a small fee. The mixed quality of Kalingalinga, where older residents run small businesses and work with locally produced material, while the younger generation feels more economic and other progress has been made, makes it \\"a microcosm of our society and a mirror of our progress\\", according to Andrew Sardanis. One of Kalingalinga's challenges is the much more frequent flooding and other weather-related incidents. Especially housing is impacted by flooding; a study showed that while locals are taking measures to adapt to the changing circumstances, there is little support from the government. Another challenge is HIV/Aids. Our Lady's Hospice in Kalingalinga has participated in studies on the disease, and received a grant from the British High Commission for promoting AIDS awareness and peer education programs. The hospice is supported by Irish Aid, Contesa Charity, and other donors. In 1990, the government's removal of food subsidies led to widespread rioting in Lusaka; the riots started in Kalingalinga before spreading to the city center, killing over 30 people. Socioeconomic characteristics According to a 1992/1993 survey, almost 70% of women and slightly over 40% of men in Kalingalinga were involved in agriculture; over 30% of women and less than 20% of men were involved in (dry-season) gardening. Some young boys from Kalingalinga fell victim to a scheme set up by a Texas group called Teaching Teachers to Teach, supposedly a Baptist missionary organization that took some boys over the United States to sing in a choir. In return for their singing, money was to be sent back for schools and other essentials, and the boys were to receive schooling. However, the boys were practically enslaved in the US, forced to sing up to seven concerts per day and to dig a swimming pool for the minister leading the group, Keith Grimes, who pocketed the choir's earnings. By 2000, Grimes had died and his daughter was trying to do damage control when the group of boys had found out that nothing was done to improve the situation in Kalingalinga. She tried to have a number of boys deported, which led the US Immigration and Naturalization Service to investigate the matter and, in the end, free the choir. Grimes's daughter and her husband were never charged, since the abuse occurred months before the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 was passed. Recreational activities The charity Africa On The Ball helped found the football team Kalingalinga FC in 2011, a team which is as much about playing football as it is about proper nutrition and education. The sale of a jersey by Kenya-born football player Victor Wanyama in 2013 was to pay for a team bus.

Design and development The shoulder mounted wing was supported by sizeable lift struts attached to the landing gear, which featured an additional lifting area between the wheels. A section of wing root was cut away to improve downward visibility. The fuselage and wing were fabric covered. It was armed with two synchronized Vickers machine guns. The first prototype made its first flight in early January 1918 while powered by a Gnome Monosoupape 9N rotary engine, the same engine used in the Nieuport 28. The second prototype first flew in late January 1918 with the slightly more powerful Le Rh√¥ne 9R. This aircraft had a revised wing whose inboard trailing edges were cut away and an elongated fin. On 1 May 1918 the second prototype was rejected in favour of the Monosoupape powered model. The Nieuport Madon was not officially accepted but would be refined through the Nieuport 31 the Nieuport-Delage Sesquiplan and into the Nieuport-Delage NiD 62 which was still in second line service in 1940.

He wrote for many anarchist journals. Life Louis Alexandre Louvet was born in the 2nd arrondissement of Paris on 7 February 1899. During World War I (1914‚Äì18) he was mobilized on 19 April 1918, and remained in the army until December 1919. Inter-war period As a young man Louvet drove an electric tram in Paris. In 1922 he joined the Young Socialists. In November 1924 Louvet became the director of Libertaire, the journal of the Union Anarchiste (Anarchist Union). In 1925 he founded the F√©d√©ration des Jeunesses anarchistes, and from 1925 to 1926 published L'√©veil des jeunes libertaires. On 18 June 1925 he was charged as manager of Libertaire for an unsigned article published in January 1925 on La justice de Primo de Rivera. He was sentenced in absentia to six months in prison and a 200 franc fine for provocation to murder for the purpose of anarchist propaganda. Louvet left the Libertaire for La Revue anarchiste, and joined the board of the Librairie Sociale. In 1926 he was arrested for putting up posters against the Moroccan War. Due to disagreements over illegal activity, he left the Union Anarchiste'. Louvet married, but separated from his wife. From 1926 to 1947 Simone Larcher (1903‚Äì69) was his companion. They had one daughter. On 21 April 1926 he relaunched L'Anarchie, an individualistic anarchist journal which appeared until 1929. He was arrested on 20 July 1926 for distributing leaflets in support of Sacco and Vanzetti. On 27 June 1927 he was sentenced in absentia to four months in prison for inciting soldiers to disobedience. He gave himself up on 5 September 1927 and was placed in La Sant√© Prison. From 2‚Äì10 October 1927 he undertook a hunger strike in solidarity with the protestors who had been arrested for demonstrating against the execution of Sacco et Vanzetti. His sentence was remitted and he was released on 5 December 1927. On 8 January 1928 Louvet was one of the founders of the Association des F√©d√©rations Anarchistes (AFA, Association of Anarchist Federalists). From 1932 until the outbreak of war in 1939 he and his partner, Simone Larcher, devoted themselves to Les Causeries populaires (Popular Lectures). These provided a forum for free discussion and conferences which he chaired. He published a monthly bulletin of the Causeries populaires which became L'Action libre in November 1931 and then les cahiers libres d'√©tudes sociales controverse from January 1932. When the tram stopped operation in 1937 he began work as a proofreader, and became an active member of the proofreader's union. World War II and later Louvet was recalled to the army in September 1939 at the outbreak of World War II (1939‚Äì45), but was demobilized in August 1940. During the German occupation of France (1941‚Äì44) Louvet was vice president of the Association of Mutual Support of the Press, a clandestine organization founded in 1942. He held this position until November 1944, after the liberation of France. He helped Roger Monclin join the proofreaders union in 1943. After the liberation he resumed his activities as a militant anarchist, and with Charles-Auguste Bontemps created the journal Ce qu'il faut dire (CQFD). From June 1945 he was a member of the Mouvement √âgalit√© (Equality Movement). Louvet participated in the founding congress of the Anarchist Federation in Paris in 6‚Äì7 October 1945, which he joined in February 1946. In December 1946 he participated in relaunching the Conf√©d√©ration nationale du travail (CNT, National Confederation of Labor). In December 1953 he was involved with the reorganization of the Anarchist Federation. In 1957 he was on the staff of Le Monde libertaire. Louis Alexandre Louvet contracted cancer. He died on 15 March 1971 in the 13th arrondissement, aged 72. His ashes were placed in P√®re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. Publications Louvet wrote on subjects such as anarcho-syndicalism, the anarchist movement, free thought, anticlericalism, pacifism and neo- malthusianism in journals such as Le Libertaire (1924), L'√âveil des jeunes libertaires (1925), L'Anarchie (1925), La Revue Anarchiste (1925), Controverse (1932), Ce Qu'il Faut Dire (1944-1945), Les Nouvelles pacifistes (1949) and Contre-Courant (1951). He was also involved in various publishing projects. In November 1959 he started a \\"Biographical Dictionary of Pacifist Anarchist Pioneers and Militants\\", but it did not progress beyond the letter \\"B\\".

The title is likely an allusion to new recordings of two 'vintage' titles included in the track list. \\"Maria\\" was first recorded on Maynard '62 (it is presented here in a new arrangement), and \\"Airegin\\" was first recorded in 1964 for the album Color Him Wild (this new recording features the original Mike Abene arrangement). The front cover plays on this theme, presenting a trumpet in an ice bucket in place of a bottle of champagne, while on the back cover, the cork is seen popping out of the trumpet's bell.  Background and production  After unexpectedly \\"catching lightning in a bottle\\" with Conquistador, Columbia and Ferguson were eager to repeat the success. Taking the same basic ingredients of a big theme song (\\"Star Wars\\"), a couple of originals, some guest guitar work (this time provided by Steve Khan), a reworking of a classical theme (in the same vein as Primal Scream's \\"Pagliacci\\"), a couple of Bobby Militello flute solos, and looking deep into Maynard's book to revive \\"Airegin\\", for a high-energy finale, they hoped to re-create that same magic while Conquistador was still on the charts. This was also a return to using the touring band as the core of the album's sound, with only a slightly augmented brass section. The strings and background vocalists were still used to maintain the level of production and polish from the previous 2 albums.  Critical reception  Following the same strategy as the previous album, the album's opening track (\\"Main Title (From the 20th Century-Fox Film Star Wars)\\") was released as a single, but didn't have nearly the success as Conquistador's \\"Gonna Fly Now\\". As with other albums of this period, reviewers were not kind regarding this release, and didn't hesitate to make their contempt known. AllMusic's Matt Collar summed up how many reviewers felt, calling it \\"Utterly gimmicky and bereft of any actual jazz...\\"  Reissues  In 2004, New Vintage was reissued by Wounded Bird Records.

He was most well known as lead singer of 1980s new wave band Time UK with Rick Buckler of The Jam, Danny Kustow of Tom Robinson Band, Martin Gordon (bassist in Sparks, who was then replaced by Nick South of Yoko Ono Band, Sniff 'n' the Tears and Steve Marriott's All Stars) and Ray Simone. The latter was also in Edwards's late seventies punk new wave band, Masterswitch.  Early life and ancestry  Edwards was born in 1949 in Chiswick, England, and grew up in Kensal Rise to age 11, after which the family moved to Ashford, Middlesex. His maternal grandmother was Russian and lived in Berlin in the 1920s. Edwards' mother was born around 1912 and might, according to Edwards, have been born out of wedlock. Edwards' father owned a pair of blue collar companies. In the 1980s, Edwards married singer, Honey Bane.  Career  Edwards career began in the sixties with mod bands \\"The Cult\\" (1963‚Äì64); \\"The Neat Change\\", perhaps the first Skinhead band, formed in 1966; \\"The Washington Flyers\\", \\"Stumpy\\", \\"Edwards & Guest\\"; and \\"English Rose\\", was formed with Lynton Guest of Love Affair (1968‚Äì72) whose music (the song \\"Yesterdays Hero\\") was featured in the film \\"Groupie girl\\" (also known as \\"I am a Groupie\\"). Edwards appeared in the film as the character \\"Bob\\", and was billed as \\"Jimmie Edwardes\\". \\"The Neat Change\\" had a strong London Mod/skinhead following in the late mid/late 1960s and their one recorded song \\"I lied to Auntie May\\" was released on the Decca label, and is considered a classic of the genre. The Neat Change played at the Marque Club in London on numerous occasions, gaining as much praise as the Small Faces and The Who. During the early 1970s, Edwards became an A+R man at Dawn records and signed the huge hit \\"Kung Fu Fighting\\" by Carl Douglas. He also helped Ian Dury get discovered while working with Lynton Guest and Seve Holly (drummer with Paul McCartney's Wings) in both A+R and making music himself. During the period of 1975 to 1977, he formed the band Masterswitch, which he fronted, and which subsequently signed to Epic Records. In 1978, the band released the single \\"Action Replay\\" which suffered from poor promotion and publicity. After a million pounds advance from Epic Records, the band were even asked to split and reform over a record company row over who owned rights to the band's name in the UK or internationally. Edwards became disillusioned as a result and split the band in 1978. After the dissolution of Masterswitch, Edwards recorded several solo singles (as Jimmy and the Profile), which he released through Warner Brothers and Polydor, including \\"Nora's Diary\\", which was produced by Jimmy Pursey. In 1979 Jimmy Pursey left his band \\"Sham 69\\" briefly and Edwards was drafted in as the new singer and a single was recorded but never released as Pursey rejoined after his supergroup with Sex Pistols members - \\"The Sham Pistols\\" fell through. Edwards recorded unreleased demos with The Pretenders after the band expressed themselves as admirers. This led to members of The Pretenders recording as \\"The Profile\\" on Edwards solo work. The single \\"Twentieth Century Time\\" was engineered by Pete Wilson who went on to produce The Jam and The Style Council. Edwards recorded a version of The Jam song In the City which included a lyric change which was approved by Paul Weller. It was produced by Godley and Creme of 10CC. Despite being released on Polydor Records it failed to chart. After the dissolution of The Jam in 1982, drummer and writer Rick Buckler contacted Edwards and formed Time UK in 1983. From 1983 to 1985 Edwards then wrote songs for Time UK. Time UK had a minor UK hit with \\"The Cabaret/Remember Days\\" (which sold 60,000 copies and reached number 63 in the British charts - the original version of \\"The Cabaret\\" was recorded by Edwards three years earlier and released as a single with the Profile) in 1983 after Edwards collaborated with drummer Rick Buckler of The Jam. The band narrowly missed a \\"Top of the Pops\\" performance at the BBC due to \\"Gallup\\" investigating chart sales/Rigging and as a result it was maintained by the singer that sales were not fairly took into account - and so an appearance was denied. The release was the first after The Jam's breakup, beating Weller and Foxton's subsequent releases. They released another single \\"Playground of Privilege\\"/\\"Puppets don't Bleed\\" (produced by legendary producer Tony Visconti) which was followed by \\"You won't stop\\" on Arista Records (which failed to chart). BBC TV appearances also included \\"Multi coloured swap shop\\". These recordings finally saw the light of day on \\"One More Time\\" - a 2002 CD release which included \\"Entertain Me\\" and two other tracks \\"Sunday Mood\\" and \\"So say Hurrah\\" which were recorded under the moniker -\\"Sharp\\". The Sharp sessions were recorded in 1986 on the Unicorn label - with Rick Buckler and Bruce Foxton - the only time the bassist and drummer from the Jam have been captured reunited on record since The Jam. \\"Entertain Me\\" was Sharp's only single. All songs were written by Edwards. Influences musically came from Bowie, The Jam, XTC, Psychedelic Furs and early Pink Floyd. In 2011 Edwards recorded with Sham 69 once again and he performed live as a solo artist in 2014, planning to record in 2015 with Dave Davies of The Kinks. Over a 40-year career Edwards also recorded with Godley and Creme, Flintlock, and Mean Streets. Throughout his career he came close to success but A+R difficulties, timing, luck or problems with record companies always made recognition and success elusive. Edwards died of cancer in January 2015 following a short illness aged 65.

Creation The national monument was created by a proclamation issued on July 10, 2015 by President Barack Obama under the Antiquities Act. Obama also signed proclamations creating two other national monuments (the Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument in northern California and the Waco Mammoth National Monument in central Texas) the same day. Basin and Range was also the second national monument to be created in Nevada in less than eight months; the Tule Springs Fossil Beds National Monument had been designated in 2014. Senator Harry Reid and Representative Dina Titus, both Democrats of Nevada, were major proponents of protecting the Basin and Range area; before the area's designation by executive action, they had sponsored a bill to protect the Basin and Range area (withdrawing it from mining and other uses) by legislation.Steve Tetreault & Henry Brean, A done deal, Obama to create Basin and Range monument, Las Vegas Review-Journal (July 9, 2015). The campaign to designate Basin and Range as a national monument had the support of Nevada's largest employer, MGM Resorts International, as well as Wynn Resorts, Barrick Gold Corporation, Rockwood Lithium North America, the Las Vegas Metro Chamber of Commerce, and the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. Some members of the local population opposed the designation and complained of limited public involvement. The creation of the national monument was applauded by Reid, Titus, and Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell.Quotes about Basin and Range National Monument in Nevada, NewsOK (July 10, 2015). The Sierra Club also praised the designation, stating that the area was \\"a fitting addition to our protected public lands\\" because it is \\"one of the best examples of the spectacular basins framed by Nevada‚Äôs breathtaking mountain ranges, a resting place for historic artifacts critical to understanding our nation's Native American cultural history, and home to unique plants and animals, some found only in Nevada and this region.\\"Sierra Club, Sierra Club Praises Designation of Basin and Range National Monument: Monument Permanently Protects 704,000 Acres (July 10, 2015). Conversely, three Republican U.S. Representatives from Nevada, Mark Amodei, Joe Heck, and Cresent Hardy, condemned the new monument,Jesselyn Bickley, Cresent Hardy: Basin and Range designation a government overreach, The Spectrum (July 10, 2015). and Republican U.S. Representative Rob Bishop, the chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources, called it a \\"surreptitious land grab\\" by the Obama administration. The creation of the national monument was a setback for long-controversial plans to open a nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada.Cy Ryan, Why new national monument could derail plans for nuke dump at Yucca, Las Vegas Sun (July 10, 2015). Previously, a U.S. Department of Energy study had looked at possible railroad routes to carry radioactive waste to Yucca Mountain and had proposed a Caliente-to-Yucca Mountain route, of which would run through an area later designated at Basin and Range National Monument. Robert Halstead, the executive director of the Nevada Agency for Nuclear Projects, said the proclamation of the Basin and Range National Monument was the \\"final nail in the coffin\\" of the railroad project and would \\"really complicate life\\" for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Description and significance Basin and Range National Monument, Nevada The Basin and Range National Monument area has geological, ecological, cultural, historical, paleoecological, seismological, archaeological, and paleoclimatological significance. The area is located in a transitional region between the Mojave Desert and the Sagebrush Steppe of the Great Basin. Major features within the national monument include: Garden Valley and Coal Valley; the Worthington Mountains, containing the Worthington Mountains Wilderness Area; the Golden Gate Range; the Seaman Range; the Mount Irish Range; the Hiko Narrows; the White River Narrows; and the Shooting Gallery rock art site. Native American rock art at the site is about 4,000 years old. The national monument consists largely of existing federal lands, managed by Bureau of Land Management of the United States Department of the Interior both before and after the national monument's creation. Within the monument boundary there are privately owned lands including Michael Heizer's City, a massive earth art piece similar in size to the National Mall in Washington. At the time of the monument's creation, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art held a conservation easement over the area of the still- incomplete artwork; the museum plans to donate this easement to the United States when the work is completed. The proclamation allows for continued historic uses of the area (e.g., hunting and fishing) under preexisting regulations. The proclamation also does not affect grazing operations within the monument (including \\"use of motorized vehicles, construction and maintenance of water infrastructure, and construction of fences and other range improvements\\"). The proclamation also does not affect U.S. military uses of monument; the military will continue to use the monument's land and airspace for emergency response and training. Fauna of significance in the national monument include desert bighorn sheep, golden eagle, and many species of bat, lizard, and snake.

She was hit in the back by a single bullet. The man who fired the gun, Jos√© Inez Garc√≠a Z√°rate, said he had found it moments before, wrapped in cloth beneath a bench on which he was sitting, and that when he picked it up the weapon went off. The shot ricocheted off the concrete deck of the pier and struck the victim, who was about 90 feet away. Steinle died two hours later in a hospital as a result of her injuries. On November 30, 2017, after five days of deliberations, a jury acquitted Garc√≠a Z√°rate of all murder and manslaughter charges. He was convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm, but that conviction was overturned on appeal on August 30, 2019. Garc√≠a Z√°rate's immigration status made the shooting controversial and led to political criticism of San Francisco's status as a sanctuary city, as Garc√≠a Z√°rate is an undocumented immigrant residing in the United States who had previously been deported five times. Donald Trump, at the time a presidential candidate, cited Garc√≠a Z√°rate in support of his proposal to deport criminal \\"illegal immigrants\\" living in the United States, and mentioned Steinle during his acceptance speech at the 2016 Republican National Convention. Shooting Garc√≠a Z√°rate told ABC station KGO-TV in a jailhouse interview that he started wandering on Pier 14, a tourist attraction area at the Embarcadero waterfront district, Wednesday, July 1, after taking sleeping pills he found in a dumpster. He said he then picked up a gun that he found. Garc√≠a Z√°rate fired one shot from a .40-caliber SIG Sauer P239 handgun with a seven-cartridge magazine. One bullet struck Steinle in the back and pierced her aorta. She collapsed to the pavement while screaming to her father, who was accompanying her at the pier, for help. Her father and others performed CPR on Kathryn before paramedics arrived and took her to an ambulance. She died two hours later at San Francisco General Hospital. Garc√≠a Z√°rate was arrested about an hour after the shooting at Pier 40, about south of Pier 14, and divers from the San Francisco Police Department Underwater Recovery Unit found the gun in the bay alongside Pier 14 the following day. On July 5, 2015, investigators returned to the pier and found a point from Garc√≠a Z√°rate's presumed location where a bullet had ricocheted off of the concrete. Following his arrest, Garc√≠a Z√°rate was booked into San Francisco County Jail on suspicion of murder. The gun used by Garc√≠a Z√°rate had been stolen in downtown San Francisco from a Bureau of Land Management (BLM) ranger's personal vehicle on June 27, 2015, according to the Bureau of Land Management. The ranger, John Woychowski, testified at trial that he had left the weapon holstered and unsecured in a backpack under the front seat of his personal vehicle while he went to dinner with his family. The car's window had been broken. Victim Kathryn Michelle (Kate) Steinle (December 13, 1982 ‚Äì July 1, 2015) was originally from Pleasanton, California, grew up in Germany as a \\"military brat\\" and graduated from Amador Valley High School. She earned a communications degree from California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo. She was employed at Medtronic in San Francisco and was living on Beale Street, close to Pier 14, the site of the shooting.Pier 14, City Maps. Retrieved November 29, 2016. Her funeral was held at a winery in Pleasanton on July 9. Perpetrator Jos√© Inez Garc√≠a Z√°rate (or Juan Francisco L√≥pez- S√°nchez), of Guanajuato, Mexico, is an undocumented immigrant who was deported from the U.S. a total of five times, most recently in 2009. He was on probation in Texas at the time of the shooting. He had seven felony convictions, none of them for violent crimes. When he was apprehended, Garc√≠a Z√°rate was listed as 45 years old by police, but as 52 in jail records. Garc√≠a Z√°rate arrived in the U.S. sometime before 1991, the year he was convicted of his first drug charge in Arizona. He worked in Washington state in roofing and construction, and was also convicted three times there for felony heroin possession and manufacturing narcotics. Following another drug conviction and jail term, this time in Oregon, the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) deported Garc√≠a Z√°rate in June 1994. However, Garc√≠a Z√°rate returned to the U.S. within two years and was convicted again of heroin possession in Washington state. He was deported for the second time in 1997. On February 2, 1998, Garc√≠a Z√°rate was deported for the third time, after reentering the U.S. through Arizona. United States Border Patrol caught him six days later at a border crossing, and a federal court sentenced Garc√≠a Z√°rate to five years and three months in federal prison for unauthorized reentry. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), successor of the INS, deported Garc√≠a Z√°rate in 2003 for his fourth deportation. However, he reentered the U.S. through the Texas border and got another federal prison sentence for reentry before being deported for the fifth time in June 2009. Less than three months after his fifth deportation, Garc√≠a Z√°rate was caught attempting to cross the border in Eagle Pass, Texas. He pleaded guilty to felony reentry; upon sentencing, a federal court recommended Garc√≠a Z√°rate be placed in \\"a federal medical facility as soon as possible\\". On March 26, 2015, at the request of the San Francisco Sheriff's Department (SFSD), United States Bureau of Prisons (BOP) had turned Garc√≠a Z√°rate over to San Francisco authorities for an outstanding drug warrant. San Francisco officials transported Garc√≠a Z√°rate to San Francisco County Jail on March 26, 2015, to face a 20-year-old felony charge of selling and possessing marijuana after Garc√≠a Z√°rate completed his latest prison term in San Bernardino County for entering in the country without the proper documents. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) had issued a detainer for Garc√≠a Z√°rate requesting that he be kept in custody until immigration authorities could pick him up. However, as a sanctuary city, San Francisco's \\"Due Process for All\\" ordinance restricted cooperation with ICE to only cases where the immigrant had both current violent felony charges and past violent felony convictions; therefore, San Francisco disregarded the detainer and released him. He was released from San Francisco County Jail on April 15, 2015, and had no outstanding warrants or judicial warrants, as confirmed by the San Francisco Sheriff's Department. Legal proceedings Garc√≠a Z√°rate was formally charged with first-degree murder and possession of illegal narcotics on July 6. Garc√≠a Z√°rate admitted in a KGO-TV interview that he committed the shooting but said he found the gun wrapped in a T-shirt under a bench after taking sleeping pills he found from a trash can. He first claimed that he was aiming at sea lions, then that the gun had fired while he was picking up the wrapped package, and that Steinle's shooting was accidental. During a pretrial hearing, a judge disallowed the interview to be used as evidence. Garc√≠a Z√°rate pleaded not guilty to the charges, and was held on $5 million bail. Garc√≠a Z√°rate's attorney, Matt Gonzalez, stated in court that the shooting was likely accidental. On July 28, prosecutors filed an additional charge against Garc√≠a Z√°rate: being a felon in possession of a firearm. On September 4, San Francisco Superior Court Judge Brendan Conroy stated that there was enough evidence to try Garc√≠a Z√°rate. Initially charged with first-degree murder, Garc√≠a Z√°rate was eventually tried for second-degree murder. If found guilty of the charges of second-degree murder, being a felon in possession of a firearm, and an enhancement of using a firearm, Garc√≠a Z√°rate could have faced life in prison without the possibility of parole. The jury also had the option of deciding if he was guilty of involuntary manslaughter (where the death occurs without intent but \\"through the negligent or reckless actions of the defendant\\". In August, a judge set December 2 as the date to assign the case to a judge for trial. Garc√≠a Z√°rate's public defender said there were no discussions of a plea deal. However, the trial date set for December 2016 was postponed. Garc√≠a Z√°rate returned to court July 14, 2017. The trial was postponed again on July 25, but the defendant asserted his right to a speedy trial, meaning that the trial was required to begin within 60 days. The trial began October 23, 2017, with opening statements and a brief testimony from Steinle's father. On subsequent days, jurors heard testimonies from eyewitnesses of the shooting, local investigators and the BLM ranger whose stolen gun was used in the crime. Police revealed how they had lied to Garc√≠a Z√°rate in order to motivate him to confess to the shooting by saying that they had more evidence than had actually been collected at the time. The prosecution contended he brought the stolen gun to the crime scene while the defense claimed the weapon was found under a Pier 14 seat. The defense called its first witness, the crime lab supervisor, after the prosecution rested its case after two weeks of testimony. Their case was that the shooting was accidental and occurred when Garc√≠a Z√°rate picked up the newly found gun. Experts regarding video enhancement and Spanish translation were heard to bolster the claim of an accidental shooting and incomplete investigation. A key point of contention was the ease with which the weapon could have been fired accidentally. A supervising criminologist at the San Francisco Police Department crime lab testified that the gun was in excellent condition and would not have fired without someone pulling the trigger. The defense emphasized that the Sig Sauer pistol has no external safety mechanism to prevent accidental firing, and pointed to a record of even police trained in the use of Sig Sauer pistols having made accidental discharges. As examined by the criminologist, it was placed in single-action mode (where the hammer is cocked), rather than double- action mode (where a single pull of the trigger both cocks and releases the hammer). While it is typical for a gun that has been fired to be in single- action mode, a gun in single-action mode also requires less trigger pressure to fire. The defense argued that this made it more plausible that Garc√≠a Z√°rate could have pulled the trigger accidentally while picking up or unwrapping the bundled gun. Woychowski, a BLM ranger, testified that he always left the pistol in double-action mode, but that he typically loaded it in single-action mode, and couldn't definitively say that he had returned it to double-action mode before it was stolen. The defense rested its case after four days. Prior to closing arguments, Judge James Feng agreed to a request by the prosecutor Diana Garcia to instruct the jury in first-degree murder, second-degree murder, and involuntary manslaughter. \\"The jury will be instructed on multiple theories of homicide,\\" said District Attorney's Office spokesman Alex Bastian. Jury deliberations began after 12 days of testimony, dozens of witnesses and two days of closing arguments on November 21, 2017. On November 30, 2017, after five days of deliberations, the jury acquitted Garc√≠a Z√°rate of all murder and manslaughter charges, but convicted him of being a felon in possession of a firearm. The Department of Justice unsealed a federal arrest warrant for Garc√≠a Z√°rate following his trial. The charges include felon in possession of a firearm, involuntary manslaughter, and assault with a deadly weapon. There is an existing federal detainer for Garc√≠a Z√°rate to be transported to the Western District of Texas by U.S. Marshals. On January 11, 2019, Garc√≠a Z√°rate filed an appeal of his felon in possession conviction in the First Appellate District of the California Court of Appeal. On August 30, 2019, the California state 1st District Court of Appeals overturned the gun conviction saying \\"the judge failed to instruct the jury on one of his defenses\\". Investigation The gun used in the shooting was confirmed by forensic crime laboratory technicians to be the same one stolen from a federal agent's car. The .40-caliber handgun had been taken from a U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) ranger's car that was parked in downtown San Francisco, on June 27, 2015. The ranger, John Woychowski, was in San Francisco for an official government business trip. He testified at trial that he had left the weapon holstered and unsecured in a backpack under the front seat of his personal vehicle while he went to dinner with his family. Woychowski immediately reported the theft to San Francisco police, as well as the Federal Bureau of Investigation's National Crime Information Center. Police issued a citywide crime alert but did not call in CSI technicians to examine the scene. Ballistics experts for both the prosecution and defense agreed with the investigators finding that, after Garc√≠a Z√°rate fired the gun, the bullet ricocheted off the pavement away from him before traveling another and striking Steinle. Family lawsuit In September 2015, the Steinle family announced their intention to file a lawsuit against the City of San Francisco, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Bureau of Land Management, alleging complicity and negligence in the death of their daughter. On January 7, 2017, Magistrate Judge Joseph C. Spero dismissed the family's claims against San Francisco and former Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi. The magistrate also dismissed their claim against ICE, but he ruled that the lawsuit accusing the Bureau of Land Management of negligence can proceed. In January 2020, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that Kate's family could not sue the city of San Francisco. Reaction The killing sparked fierce criticism and political debate over San Francisco's sanctuary city policy, which disallows local officials from questioning a resident's immigration status, thus enabling local victims to report crimes without fear of deportation. Multiple Republican presidential candidates, including Donald Trump and Jeb Bush, made statements blaming the immigration policy for Steinle's death; Trump further called for the need for a secure border wall. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest stated that the U.S. would be safer if Republican lawmakers had approved comprehensive immigration reform backed by President Barack Obama. 2016 U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton joined California Senator and former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat, in condemning the policy. Clinton said, \\"The city made a mistake, not to deport someone that the federal government strongly felt should be deported ... So I have absolutely no support for a city that ignores the strong evidence that should be acted on.\\" That same week, Feinstein penned a public letter to San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee that stated, \\"The tragic death of Ms. Steinle could have been avoided if the Sheriff's Department had notified ICE prior to the release of Mr. Sanchez, which would have allowed ICE to remove him from the country.\\" Local and state reaction San Francisco County Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi received criticism by anti-illegal immigration activist groups, including Californians for Population Stabilization, and a range of politicians, including San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee and California U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein, for Garc√≠a Z√°rate's release from custody before the shooting. Lee stated the sanctuary city ordinance allows the sheriff to coordinate with federal immigration and ICE agents. On July 7, Feinstein stated that the San Francisco County Sheriff's Department should have notified ICE before Garc√≠a Z√°rate was released, so that he could be deported from the county. In a press conference held on July 10, Mirkarimi blamed federal prison and immigration officials for the series of events that led up to the release of Garc√≠a Z√°rate. Ross Mirkarimi lost his bid for re-election to Vicki Hennessy on November 3, 2015, receiving 38% of the vote. Political reactions The Donald Trump presidential campaign for the 2016 election released the political advertisement \\"Act of Love\\", showing Garc√≠a Z√°rate and criticizing rival Jeb Bush's policy on immigration. Later, when accepting the Republican nomination for president at the 2016 Republican National Convention, Trump mentioned Steinle's death as a rationale to deport illegal aliens in the United States. After the 2017 Presidential Inauguration, President Trump again mentioned Steinle and other victims of violent crime by illegal aliens when creating the Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement (VOICE) Office within ICE. Kate's Law In response to the controversy, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz from Texas and U.S. Representative Matt Salmon from Arizona introduced , the Establishing Mandatory Minimums for Illegal Reentry Act of 2015, also known as Kate's Law. No vote was ever held. In July 2015, however, the House did pass the Enforce the Law for Sanctuary Cities Act (), a related bill that is often confused with Kate's Law. Members of Steinle's family did not want her to be in the middle of a political controversy, according to the San Francisco Chronicle, and actually support sanctuary cities. \\"I don‚Äôt know who coined 'Kate‚Äôs Law,'\\" Kate's father Jim Steinle told the paper. \\"It certainly wasn't us.\\" In July 2016, a Senate version of the law () was filibustered with the motion to invoke cloture receiving 55‚Äì42 votes mostly by Senate Republicans, therefore insufficient to defeat the filibuster. The Senate also voted on another bill often confused with Kate's Law, the Stop Dangerous Sanctuary Cities Act (). The bill failed to proceed to a final vote in the Senate. On June 23, 2017, U.S. Representative Bob Goodlatte from Virginia reintroduced two bills, Kate's Law () and No Sanctuary for Criminals, an anti-sanctuary city policy (), into the House which passed on June 29 and proceeded to the Senate.

Two were built in 1911. Design and development From the Type B of 1911 to the World War I Caudron G.3 Caudron biplanes had a common layout with tractor engines, occupants in a nacelle mounted between the wings and empennage on twin booms. The earlier Types B-D in this sequence began as equal span biplanes, then were modified into sesquiplanes. In its original form, the Type C was an equal span, wire braced two bay biplane, though the inner bay was only about half the width of the outer. The two spar fabric covered wings had the same rectangular plan apart from angled tips. Wing area was . There was no stagger, so the two sets of parallel interplane struts were parallel and vertical. The rear spar was ahead of mid-chord, leaving the ribs in the rear part of the wing flexible and allowing roll control by wing warping. The nacelle was a simple, flat sided structure. As on the Type B, it was supported above the lower wing on two more pairs of interplane struts but on the Type C the left and right pairs passed within the nacelle, rather than down its sides. A Gnome Omega rotary engine was mounted in the front under a rudimentary shield to protect the pilot from oil spray, though a Anzani 3-cylinder radial engine could also fitted. The nacelle extended aft at the wing trailing edge, with the pilot just aft of mid-chord. The empennage of the Type C was supported on a pair of girders arranged parallel to one another in plan. The upper girder members were attached to the upper wing spars at the tops of the innermost interplane struts and the lower ones ran under the lower wing, mounted on downward extensions of the inner interplane struts. The mounting was strengthened with two diagonal struts on each side, one from the base of the forward interplane strut to the upcurved tip of the lower member and the other from the rear interplane strut to the junction of the lower member and its first vertical cross member. Each of these lower members, which supported the aircraft on the ground as skids, carried twin, rubber sprung landing wheels. Behind the wing the upper and lower members converged to the rear; the drag on the lower members reduced the landing run to There were three vertical cross braces on each girder but the only lateral inter-girder cross-members were near the tail, though there was wire bracing. The broad chord, roughly rectangular, warping tailplane was mounted a little below the upper girder member. Above it, a pair of rectangular rudders were separated by about one third of the tailplane span. Two Type Cs were built and delivered to the military in November 1911. In July 1912 they were modified into sesquiplanes to ease their accommodation in field tents. The Type C appeared in the Caudron catalogue of 1912 in that form, with the upper wing overhang supported by parallel, outward leaning struts from the bases of the outer interplane struts.

Kim Hyong-gwon was an uncle of the founding North Korean leader, Kim Il-sung. As such, he is among the most celebrated of the Kim family members in North Korean propaganda. Kimhyonggwon County in North Korea is named after him. Personal life Seodaemun Prison, where Kim Hyong-gwon died, was used for keeping anti-colonial activists in custody. In his youth, Kim Hyong-gwon studied in Sunhwa school near his home in present- day Mangyongdae, Pyongyang. Kim was a revolutionary fighter and an active communist in the 1930s. His personality has been described as \\"hot-tempered\\". In August 1930, he led a small detachment of guerrillas across the Amnok (Yalu) river to Japanese-occupied Korea from Manchuria. His small group's actions near Pungsan at that time got noticed by the Japanese press. He captured two Japanese police cars, and both of these acts occurred in mountainous terrain. Some time after attacking a Japanese police station in Pungsan, he was arrested near Hongwon. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison when he was 28 years old. He died on 12 January 1936, during his sentence in Seoul's Seodaemun Prison, where anti-Japanese dissidents were detained from 1910 to 1945 in cruel conditions.

There is also a Kim Hyong Gwon Teachers' College named after him, and Hamnam University of Education Nr. 1 was renamed Kim Hyong Gwon University of Education in 1990. Both of them are in Sinpo. Various sites of honor and statues have been made in Kim's memory. Once every five years, a ceremony is held on the days of his death and birth.

After a lineup change in early 2014, the group began work on a new record entitled Tuscumbia in the winter of 2015. It will be released in 2018 on Single Lock Records. The band consists of Matt Green (principal songwriter, vocalist and guitarist), Reed Watson (drums), Adam Morrow (guitar, vocals) and Hayden Crawford (bass guitar). Belle Adair opened select shows for Alabama Shakes in 2015 and 2016. They have since acted as John Paul White's backing band, currently touring throughout the United States and Europe.

It is about the treatment of accused communists in post-Cold War America.Wertheim, Albert. \\"The McCarthy Era and the American Theatre.\\" Theatre Journal, Vol. 34, no.2. \\"Insurgency in American Theatre. (May, 1982). Pp. 211-22. Print. It was originally presented at the off-Broadway Phoenix Theatre in New York City. Synopsis Brooks Atkinson gives the following description of Sing Me No Lullaby. > Some Illinois college friends of 1938 [ ] have a country reunion at > Christmas of the present time. As students, most of them had what were known > as progressive political ideas in 1938. One of them, a brilliant > mathematician, placed his faith in Soviet Russia then. The Stalin-Hitler > pact shook all that faith out of him in 1939. By the present time he is one > of the dispossessed. Because of his college political associations, no one > will employ him, no one will rent him an apartment, no one will associate > with him, no one will clear him, no one will adjudicate his case.Atkinson, > Brooks. Quoted by Dramatist Play Service. Reception Sing Me No Lullaby received praise for its political content. The New York Times asserted that \\"The third act of Sing Me No Lullaby constitutes the most forceful statement anyone has made in the theatre for ages.\\"New York Times, quoted by Dramatists Play Service. Richard Watts wrote that Ardrey was \\"striving with the most obvious sincerity to probe the unhealthy and hysterical political climate of America in the wake of the cold war.\\"The New York Post, October 1954. Reprinted in New York Theatre Critics Reviews 15 (1954), p. 279. Print. Atkinson (quoted above) goes on: > Mr. Ardrey doesn't solve the problem. But the contribution he has made in > the last act is a clear and perceptive statement of this nameless, formless > situation and an estimation of what it is doing to America. ... Mr. Ardrey > ... is a man of principle and taste. In Sing Me No Lullaby he has performed > the function of a writer. He has found the words to describe something that > is vague and elusive but ominous. And he has got far enough away from > political recriminations to state it in terms of character and the life of > the spirit. In a later New York Times review, Atkinson wrote that \\"After the triviality of a theatre that normally aims low and is satisfied with technical competence, it is heartening to see a play that is as adult, if not more adult, than the world outside the theatre.\\"Atkinson, Brooks. \\"Sing No Lullaby\\" The New York Times, 24 October, 1954.

She had a burthen of 120 tons (bm), and was armed with twelve 12-pounder carronades. As a hired armed vessel she captured several privateers and recaptured a number of British merchant vessels. After her service with the Royal Navy, she apparently sailed as a letter of marque until the French captured her in 1806. Hired armed vessel She may have been re-rigged as a brig early in her career as most of the mentions of her refer to her as the \\"hired brig Lady Charlotte\\". In 1799 to 1800 she was under the command of Lieutenant S. Halliday.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 2, p. 640. In January 1801, Lady Charlotte was under the command of Lieutenant George Morris. That month she captured the brig D'Eendraght. On 11 February, Lady Charlotte was in Plymouth Sound when she sighted a vessel and gave chase. Eventually Lady Charlotte was able to capture the lugger Espoir. Espoir was armed with two brass 4-pounder and four iron 2-pounder guns, and had a crew of 23 men. She was two days out of Cherbourg and had not taken any prizes. Because of the strength of the wind, Lady Charlotte was not able to take prisoners off nor put a prize crew on board so she escorted her prize into port. Around 18 March, HMS Scout was in company with the hired armed vessels Sheerness and Lady Charlotte when they captured a large Dutch East Indiaman off St Alban's Head. She was Crown Prince, of 1,400 tons and 18 guns, and had been sailing from China to Copenhagen with a cargo of tea.Naval Chronicle (Jan-Jun 1801), Vol. 5, p.275. Because Sheerness and Lady Charlotte had sailed under Admiral Milbanke's orders, he and Admiral Hollowly were entitled to a share of the cargo, which was of \\"immense value\\".Naval Chronicle (Jan-Jun 1801), Vol. 5, p.278. On 29 March Lady Charlotte went in chase of the brig Friendship, which had been sailing from London to Dublin when a French privateer had taken her off Portland. Sheerness captured the privateer Pluton, the privateer in question, some six leagues north of La Hogue. The hired armed cutter Union recaptured Friendship on the night of the 29th. On 20 April, Lady Charlotte and Sheerness left Portland roads and after receiving a signal of an enemy off the coast, both vessels sailed southward as Lady Charlotte had information that a privateer had captured a schooner in the area. As it turned out, Sheerness sighted an enemy lugger privateer and her prize, and set out in chase. Sheerness dispatched her gig after the prize, which the gig captured off Alderney the next day. Sheerness herself captured the privateer, which turned out to be Prefet de la Manche. She was armed with sixteen 2-pounder guns and had a crew of 49 men under the command of Captain Le Froment. The prize the gig recaptured was the schooner Soker, of Colchester, which had been sailing in ballast. The winds were such that Lady Charlotte was unable to go to Sheernesss assistance, and instead sent her boats after three brigs and a sloop that Pr√©fet de la Manche had captured. At the approach of Lady Charlottes boats the prize crews took to their boats, abandoning their prizes and enabling Lady Charlotte to recapture all. The only one Morris was able to identify was Generous Friends, a brig of about 200 tons carrying a cargo of lead. Lloyd's List gives the names of the merchant vessels that Sheerness and Lady Charlotte recaptured and sent into Plymouth as: *Goodwill, Pycett, master; *Generous Friends, Elsay, master; *Vigilant, Arters, master, sailing from Liverpool to London; *Friendship, Folly, master, sailing from Plymouth to Ipswich; and *Soskin, Howard, master, sailing from Falmouth to Swanage.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ 4145. Lloyd's List locates all the captures near Lynne, and attributes them to the Pr√©fet de la Manche. \\"Prefet de la Mouche\\" also captured Flora, Cummings, master, as she was sailing from Dartmouth to Guernsey. Unfortunately, as Sheerness chased Pr√©fet de la Manche, an almost spent cannonball that Sheerness had fired in chase entered Pr√©fet de la Manche and killed Arters, of Vigilant, and wounded another Englishman, both of whom were having dinner with the captain of the privateer at the time. Around 20 April, the revenue cutter Greyhound, Captain Wilkinson, captured the French privateer lugger Petit Pirate (or Petit Pirrate), Captain Anselm Septan, and brought her into Weymouth. Petite Pirate was armed with four carronades (though pierced for 12 guns), and had a crew of 23 or 24 men. She was three days out of Saint- Malo.Lloyd's List, no.4146, - accessed 10 July 2015. The Naval Chronicle credits Lady Charlotte and Lieutenant Morris with the capture of Petite Pirate, which she brought into Plymouth on 26 April.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 5, p.458.It is quite possible that Lady Charlotte escorted Petit Pirate from Weymouth to Plymouth, giving rise to an incorrect attribution of capture that persisted into the various biographies of Admiral George Morris. On 2 October Morris sent into Plymouth the Danish brig Ammeotta, Muslion, master. She was sailing from Riga to Ferrol with a cargo of flax. She was set free and proceeded on her voyage.Naval Chronicle, vol. 6, p.342. Lady Charlotte came into Plymouth on 4 November and was paid off.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 6, p.429. Lieutenant Morris received a promotion to Commander in April 1802. In October 1803 he commissioned the brig HMS Penguin for the West Coast of Africa. Letter of marque On 22 October 1803, the Naval Chronicle announced that T. Lockyer, Esq., was the sole owner of two of the \\"most beautiful letters of marque that will sent from any port in the United Imperial Kingdoms of England and Ireland.\\" Both were coppered. One was , a ship of 230 tons (bm), armed with sixteen 6-pounder guns and four 42-pounder brass carronades, and under the command of Alexander Ferguson. The other was the brig Lady Charlotte, of 130 tons (bm), armed with six 18-pounder and six 12-pounder guns, and two 42-pounder carronades, and under the command of F.J. Withers. It was Lockyer's intent that the two would sail together.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 10, p.257. A Lady Charlotte, variously described as a brig or a ship, of 117 tons (bm), then received a sequence of letters of marque.\\"Register of Letters of Marque against France 1793‚Äì1815\\". ‚Äî accessed 11 June 2011. *Francis John Withers, master, 14 x 12, 18, & 42-pounder cannons, 50 crew - dated 15 August 1803 *Joseph Young, master, 14 x 12, 18, and 42-pounder cannons, 50 crew - dated 15 September 1803 *Abraham Laine, master, 10 x 4 & 6-pounder guns, 30 crew, dated 2 April 1804 *Philip Langlois, master, 10 x 4 & 6-pounder guns, 30 crew - dated 8 October 1804 *Samuel David, 6 x 3 & 4-pounder guns, 20 crew, dated 10 August 1805 *John Hallowvris [sic] Lauga, 4 x 4-pounder guns, 20 crew, dated 29 April 1806. While Lady Charlotte was under Laine's command, she was reported captured as she sailed from Madeira to the West Indies.Lloyd's List, no.4478, - accessed 10 July 2015. Given that she then received three more letters of marque, the report was in error. However, in November 1806, there was a report that a Lady Charlotte was captured and taken into Saint Martin as she was sailing from the Swedish colony of Saint Barth√©lemy to Guernsey.Lloyd's List, no. 4102, - accessed 10 July 2015.

Designed by Ralph Rapson and built in 1971, the structure houses four theaters‚Äîa thrust, proscenium, theater in the round, and black box‚Äîas well as the studios for Radio K. An anchor for the University's West Bank Arts Quarter, the Rarig has been praised for its boldness and functionality while also being described as \\"menacing\\". Design The Rarig Center was designed and built in 1971 by American architectural firm Ralph Rapson and Associates. Erected in the West Bank neighborhood of Minneapolis on the campus of the University of Minnesota, the Rarig was constructed to house theaters and television studios. It sits due west of Ferguson Hall (1985), across 4th Street South to the north of the Regis Center for Art (2003), and directly southeast of Wilson Library (1967). It is the oldest of the five buildings to make up the University's West Bank Arts Quarter. The structure was named in honor of University of Minnesota speech professor Frank Rarig and dedicated June 1, 1973. Rapson's design for the Center borrowed imagery from Swiss-French designer Le Corbusier's New Brutalism movement. In a contemporary review of the structure, author Larry Millett noted that the Rarig is the \\"strongest architectural statement on the West Bank campus.\\" Upon venturing inside, he wrote, \\"you half expect to find the leaders of the Evil Empire gathered somewhere in the three-story-high atrium, plotting the demise of Luke Skywalker.\\" Authors David Gebhard and Tom Martison indicated that, like other Rapson-designed theaters, the Rarig's were quite functional and described the building as a \\"theatrical piece of sculpture\\". Millett wrote that the building's interior rooms‚Äîthe offices, the radio and television studios, and the theaters‚Äîare all apparent in the building's external features. Facilities The Nolte Xperimental Theatre during the 2010 alt=A sunken black box theater space with several audiencemembers in the first two rows of chairs facing the stage Theaters The Rarig houses four theaters and hosts two troupes: the University Theatre and the Xperimental Theater. The largest space is the Stoll Thrust Theatre, a 460-seat thrust stage designed as a quarter-scale replica of the original Guthrie Theater, which Rapson also designed. The Thrust features a steeply overhanging balcony, described as an \\"Alpine Slope\\". The next largest theater is the Whiting Proscenium Theatre, also called the Pro, a 420-seat proscenium stage well suited to productions with large casts and dance performances. The Kilburn Arena Theatre, a 200-seat theater in the round, includes a sprung floor over the original wood flooring. The Nolte Xperimental Theatre, also known as the X, is a black box theater with a capacity of up to 99 audience members and is configurable in a variety of ways. Productions in the X are produced only by undergraduates. Other The studios of Radio K (KUOM), the University of Minnesota's radio station, are housed in the Rarig Center. A variety of classrooms and theater laboratories also exist within the building, including a design studio and costume, scenery, and lighting shops.
