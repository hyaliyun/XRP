Life He was the oldest son of Count Bernhard of Anhalt by his first wife Brigitte, a daughter of King Canute V of Denmark. Bernhard was enfeoffed with the Duchy of Saxony by Emperor Frederick Barbarossa after the deposition of the Welf duke Henry the Lion in 1180. After his death in 1212, his surviving sons divided his lands according to the laws of the House of Ascania: Henry received the old Ascanian allodial possessions in the Saxon Schwabengau around Ballenstedt, where he established the Principality of Anhalt; while his younger brother Albert inherited the Saxon ducal title and retained several unconnected Eastphalian estates around the towns of Wittenberg and Belzig (later Saxe-Wittenberg) as well as the northern lordship of Lauenburg. Anhalt coat of arms, 13th century Henry initially was a loyal supporter of the Hohenstaufen heir Frederick II, though later he temporarily switched sides to his Welf rival, Emperor Otto IV, was at feud with the Archbishops of Magdeburg, and campaigned the estates of Nienburg Abbey. From about 1215, he began to style himself \\"Prince\\" (princeps, ), and by Otto's death in 1218 was officially elevated to that rank attending the Hoftag diets of Emperor Frederick II. From 1220 Henry acted as a guardian for the minor sons of his Ascanian cousin, the late Margrave Albert II of Brandenburg, rivalling with both the Magdeburg archbishop Albert I of K√§fernburg and his brother, Duke Albert of Saxony. Henry backed Emperor Frederick II during the rebellion of his son Henry (VII) in 1234 as well as on his Italian campaigns against the Lombard League, participating in the 1238 Siege of Brescia. Back in Germany, he became involved in the conflict between the Magdeburg archbishop Wilbrand von K√§fernburg with his Ascanian cousins, the Margraves of Brandenburg, whereby the Nienburg estates were devastated by the troops of Margrave Otto III in 1242. Both sides reconciled in 1245, mediated by Duke Otto I of Brunswick who married his daughter Matilda, a niece of the Brandenburg margraves, off to Prince Henry's eldest son, Henry II. Henry's most famous ministerialis (bondsman) was Eike von Repgow, a Saxon noble from Reppichau, who compiled the Sachsenspiegel, the most important legal code of the German Middle Ages. The prince also was a renowned Minnes√§nger. At the beginning of the 14th century, five of his Minnelieder (love songs) were copied into the Codex Manesse, an exceptionally beautiful collection. In this source, he is erroneously referred to as \\"Duke\\" (Herzog). Partition of Anhalt among the sons of Henry I Before his death, about 1245, Henry retired and divided the Anhalt principality between his sons: Henry II inherited Aschersleben, Bernhard received Bernburg, and Siegfried took Zerbst. His youngest surviving sons, Hermann and Magnus, were ordained priests. The House of Ascania ruled the Duchy of Anhalt until 1918. Marriage and issue c. 1211 Henry married Irmgard (born c. 1197 ‚Äì died c. 1244), daughter of the Ludovingian landgrave Hermann I of Thuringia and a second cousin of the Hohenstaufen emperor Frederick II through her paternal grandmother Judith of Swabia. They had eleven children: #Henry II, Prince of Anhalt-Aschersleben (born 1215 ‚Äì died 12 June 1266) #Judith (died after 14 May 1277), married by 10 March 1233 to Lord Nicholas I of Werle #Sophie (died 23 November 1272), first married to Duke Otto I of Merania, secondly to Count Siegfried of Regenstein, and thirdly to Otto of Hadmersleben #Bernhard I, Prince of Anhalt-Bernburg (born c. 1218 ‚Äì died 1287) #Albert (died c. 1245), a Franciscan friar #Hermann (died 1289), a canon in Halberstadt #Magnus (died after 18 June 1264), a canon in Magdeburg #Otto (died after 19 July 1246), a canon in Magdeburg #Siegfried I, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst (born c. 1230 ‚Äì died K√∂then, 25 March 1298) #Hedwig (died 21 December 1259), married on 8 May 1242 to Duke Boleslaw II of Silesia and Liegnitz-Glogau #Gertrud (died 1275), Abbess of Gernrode (1260‚Äì1275). - Counts of Anhalt Princes of Anhalt 1170s births 1252 deaths Minnesingers 13th-century German writers 13th-century German poets ","title":"Henry I, Count of Anhalt"},{"id":"18872254","text":"David Banks (born December 17, 1967 in Wigan, England) was an English-American soccer defender who is currently the Director of Notts F.C., a youth soccer team in San Diego, California.

Savannas have regimes of a few years: blue, pink, and light green areas. Pre- Columbian savannas of North America, consisting of a mixed woodland-grassland ecosystem, were maintained by both natural lightning fires and by Native Americans before the significant arrival of Europeans. Although decimated by widespread epidemic disease, Native Americans in the 16th century continued using fire to clear savanna until European colonists began colonizing the eastern seaboard. Many colonists continued the practice of burning to clear underbrush, reinforced by their similar experience in Europe, but some land reverted to forest.  Postglacial events  During the Last Glacial Maximum about 18,000 years ago, the glacial front in the eastern United States extended south to the approximate location of the Missouri and Ohio River. These glaciers destroyed any vegetation in their path, and cooled the climate near their front. Pre-existing natural communities remained largely intact south of the glaciers, but saw an increase in dominance of pine and a now- extinct species of temperate spruce, (Picea crutchfieldii). This area included many plant communities that rely on a lightning-based fire regime, such as the longleaf pine savanna. When the glaciers began to retreat, the ancient natural communities of the southeast would be the primary source of colonization for the newly exposed areas in the midwest. Warming and drying during the Holocene climatic optimum began about 9,000 years ago and affected the vegetation of the southeast. The prairies and savannas of the southeast expanded their range, and xeric oak and oak-hickory forest types proliferated. Cooler-climate species migrated northward and upward in elevation. This retreat caused a proportional increase in pine-dominated forests in the Appalachians. At about 4,000 years BP, the Archaic Indian cultures began practising agriculture. Technology had advanced to the point that pottery was becoming common, and the small-scale felling of trees became feasible. Concurrently, the Archaic Indians began using fire in a widespread manner. Intentional burning of vegetation was taken up to mimic the effects of natural fires that tended to clear forest understories, thereby making travel easier and facilitating the growth of herbs and berry-producing plants that were important for both food and medicines. In some areas, the effects of Native Americans fires would mimic natural lightning regimes, while in others they would significantly alter the natural communities. Maritime slash pine savanna From the 16th century on, the massive depopulation of Native Americans caused by the arrival of European settlers meant an end to burning and farming across large areas. > ... by the time the first European observers were reporting the nature of > the vegetation of the region, it is likely to have changed significantly > since the regional peak of Indian influence. A myth has developed that prior > to European culture the New World was a pristine wilderness. In fact, the > vegetation conditions that the European settlers observed were changing > rapidly because of aboriginal depopulation. As a result, canopy closure and > forest tree density were increasing throughout the region.  Historic or remaining savanna areas  Savanna surrounded much of the continent's central tallgrass prairie and shortgrass prairie. Fire also swept the Rocky Mountains aspen as frequently as every ten years, creating large areas of parkland. In the far southwest was California oak woodland and Ponderosa Pine savanna, while further north was the Oregon White Oak savanna. The Central Hardwood Region covers a wide belt from northern Minnesota and Wisconsin, down through Iowa, Illinois, northern and central Missouri, eastern Kansas, and central Oklahoma to north-central Texas, with isolated pockets further east around the Great Lakes. The Eastern savannas of the United States extended further east to the Atlantic seaboard. In the southeast, longleaf pine dominated the savanna and open-floored forests which once covered from Virginia to Texas. These covered 36% of the region's land and 52% of the upland areas. Of this, less than 1% of the unaltered forest still stands. In the Eastern Deciduous Forest, frequent fires kept open areas which supported herds of bison. A substantial portion of this forest was extensively burned by agricultural Native Americans. Annual burning created many large oaks and white pines with little understory. The Southeastern Pine Region, from Texas to Virginia, is characterized by longleaf, slash, loblolly, shortleaf, and sand pines. Lightning and humans burned the understory of longleaf pine every 1 to 15 years from Archaic periods until widespread fire suppression practices were adopted in the 1930s. Burning to manage wildlife habitat did continue and was a common practice by 1950. Longleaf pine dominated the coastal plains until the early 1900s, where loblolly and slash pines now dominate. At low altitudes in the Rocky Mountain region, large areas of Ponderosa pine and Douglas fir had an open park-like structure until the 1900s. In California's Sierra Nevada area, frequent fires kept clear the understory of stands of both Ponderosa pines and giant Sequoia.  Destruction of the savannas  Industrialized sawmills in the early 20th century cleared many tall savanna old-growth trees, while fire suppression methods adopted in the 1930s and 1940s stopped much of the regular burning which the savanna required. By the latter half of the 20th century, many researchers had rediscovered both the prehistoric use of fire and methods to practice burning, but by then almost all prairie and savanna lands had been converted to agriculture or succeeded to full-canopy forest. Modern conservation of savanna includes controlled burning, and at present about a year are burned.

History Established in 1953 under the provisions of the Forward Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1952, it consists of not less than two but not exceeding four members appointed by the central government, out of them one being nominated by the central government to be the chairman of the commission. Since futures traded in India are traditionally on food commodities, the agency was originally overseen by Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution (India). The commission appeared in the news in March 2012 for their ban on guar gum futures trading after it said the price quadrupled due to its use in fracking causing food inflation. In September 2013, the commission responsibility was moved to the Ministry of Finance to reflect that futures trading was becoming more and more a financial activity. Development of the Industry India has a long history of trading commodities and considered the pioneer in some forms of derivatives trading. The first derivative market was set up in 1875 in Mumbai, where cotton futures was traded. This was followed by establishment of futures markets in edible oilseeds complex, raw jute and jute goods and bullion. This became an active industry with volumes reported to be large. However, in 1935 a law was passed allowing the government to in part restrict and directly control food production (Defence of India Act, 1935). This included the ability to restrict or ban the trading in derivatives on those food commodities. Post independence, in the 1950s, India continued to struggle with feeding its population and the government increasingly restricting trading in food commodities. Just at the time the FMC was established, the government felt that derivative markets increased speculation which led to increased costs and price instabilities. And in 1953 finally prohibited options and futures trading altogether. The industry was pushed underground and the prohibition meant that development and expansion came to a halt. In the 1970 as futures and options markets began to develop in the rest of the world, Indian derivatives markets were left behind. The apprehensions about the role of speculation, particularly in the conditions of scarcity, prompted the government to continue the prohibition well into the 1980s. The result of the period of prohibition left India with a large number of small and isolated regional futures markets. The futures markets were dispersed and fragmented, with separate trading communities in different regions with little contact with one another. The exchanges had not yet embrace modern technology or modern business practices. Next to the officially approved exchanges, there were also many havala markets. Most of these unofficial commodity exchanges have operated for many decades. Some unofficial markets trade 20‚Äì30 times the volume of the \\"official\\" futures exchanges. They offer not only futures, but also option contracts. Transaction costs are low, and they attract many speculators and the smaller hedgers. Absence of regulation and proper clearing arrangements, however, meant that these markets were mostly \\"regulated\\" by the reputation of the main players. Responsibilities and functions The functions of the Forward Markets Commission are as follows: * To advise the central government in respect of the recognition or the withdrawal of recognition from any association or in respect of any other matter arising out of the administration of the Forward Contracts (Regulation) Act 1952. * To keep forward markets under observation and to take such action in relation to them, as it may consider necessary, in exercise of the powers assigned to it by or under the Act. * To collect and whenever the Commission thinks it necessary, to publish information regarding the trading conditions in respect of goods to which any of the provisions of the act is made applicable, including information regarding supply, demand and prices, and to submit to the central government, periodical reports on the working of forward markets relating to such goods; * To make recommendations generally with a view to improving the organization and working of forward markets; * To undertake the inspection of the accounts and other documents of any recognized association or registered association or any member of such association whenever it considers it necessary. It allows futures trading in 23 fibers and manufacturers, 15 spices, 44 edible oils, 6 pulses, 4 energy products, single vegetable, 20 metal futures and 33 other futures.

The city was later occupied by Russian troops, who remained for some time before eventually withdrawing. Background Poti is the economically vital port of Georgia on the Black Sea. Poti is a critical entry point for the South Caucasus and the land-locked nations of Central Asia. Occupation Russian aircraft bombed Poti on 8 August, and the port was closed for two days. The Russian air force attacked the port on 9 August. Russian warships were deployed near Georgian ports along the Black Sea coast, including Poti, on 10 August 2008. It was reported that Russia had dropped fragmentation bombs in Poti. On 11 August, Georgian officials said that Russian forces had entered Poti, though Russia claimed they had only sent in a reconnaissance mission. In the morning of 12 August, bombing was heard an hour after Russian president had announced he would cease Russian military campaign. Russian troops drove through the port of Poti, and took up positions around it. On 12 August, combat swimmers of the Russian Black Sea Fleet conducted a successful raid on Poti harbour, destroying Georgian torpedo and missile boats. On 13 August, Al Jazeera correspondents in Poti reported \\"more and more Russian troops coming into the area all day\\" and the destruction of six Georgian vessels. Reporter Hoda Abdel Hamid said that \\"Russia is clearly on the offensive.\\" On 14 August, Reuters reported that witnesses in Poti said that Russian tanks had entered the town and were \\"looting\\". Russia's deputy chief of the general staff, Anatoliy Nogovitsyn denied the presence of Russian troops in Poti. An Associated Press Television News crew witnessed Russian troops on the outskirts of Poti as they searched an old Soviet military base for Georgian military equipment. On 15 August, BBC reporter said that Russian forces aimed to remove or destroy military equipment in Poti. From 13 to 15 August, according to Moscow Defence Brief, \\"Russian paratroops raided Poti again and again, destroying almost all of the docked ships and boats of the Georgian Navy, and took away a quantity of valuable military equipment.\\" On the morning of 19 August, some 70 Russian troops entered the port grounds. Russian forces in Poti took prisoner 21 Georgian soldiers that were guarding the port. Russians also seized 5 Humvees that were the United States property. They were taken to a Georgian military base occupied by Russian troops at Senaki. Humvees then reportedly were taken to Abkhazia, deep in Russian-held territory. Russian soldiers had deployed artillery along major highways between Abkhazia and Poti. The captured servicemen were members of the Georgian coast guard, who had returned to their previously abandoned positions in Poti on the late night of 18 August. According to Georgian officials, they had a right to do so under the ceasefire agreement. Officials from Poti followed the Russians to Senaki to negotiate the soldiers' release. The Wall Street Journal said Russian actions in Poti was another blow to Georgia's economy. An Azerbaijani news source quoted a Poti port official as saying, \\"All workers were expelled from the port\\". On 20 August, an official from the Poti port said that the Russian military had withdrawn. On 22 August, Russia declared the withdrawal of its forces was completed from Georgia. Yet, two Russian outposts remained outside Poti for patrolling. On 23 August, at a news conference General Anatoly Nogovitsyn insisted that \\"These patrols were envisaged in the international agreement\\" and \\"Poti is outside of the security zone, but that does not mean we will sit behind a fence watching them riding around in Hummers.\\" On 24 August, with Russian forces still within the port of Poti, a US warship arrived with aid supplies in Batumi, south of Poti. On 13 September, all posts near Poti were abandoned by 11:00 MSK. Aftermath The UNOSAT carried out the initial analysis of satellite pictures of Poti acquired on 25 August 2008. Six submerged Georgian vessels were identified, while no other damage was visible in the city.

Udins: language, religion, folklore and traditions. ¬´Azerbaijan and Azerbaijanis in the world¬ª magazine, ‚Ññ2, July, 2009. –°.214 It has a population of 5,744.  History  The forefathers of the Udi people were members of one of the twenty-six Caucasian Albanian tribes who played an important role in the creation of the state of Caucasian Albania, which was situated in Azerbaijan and in the southern territories of Daghestan (currently in the Russian Federation) in the 4th and 3rd centuries BC.Javadov G. National minorities of Azerbaijan. Baku, 2000. p.209 Ancient Udi was the principal language of Caucasian Albania.Mobili R. Udins: language, religion, folklore and traditions. \\"Azerbaijan and Azerbaijanis in the world\\" magazine, ‚Ññ2, July 2009. p.216 The Udi tribe was described in the writings of Herodotus,Aliyev K.G. Antic sources of the history of Azerbaijan. Baku, 1987. p.14 Strabo and Pliny the Elder.Trever K.M. Feature stories on history and culture of Caucasus Albania. IV century BC-VII century AD. Moscow-Leningrad, 1959. p.45-46. According to these chroniclers, the Udis became politically active following their involvement in the military incursions into Greece of Persian Emperor Xerxes I. They are the only ethnic minority retaining their affiliation to Christianity in Azerbaijan. The Caucasian Albanian-Udi Apostolic Autocephalous Church is located in Nij. The Udi language is a Northeast Caucasian language. Modern Udis are bilingual in both Udi and the Azeri language. During the 5th‚Äì9th centuries, Christians in Caucasian Albania used the Caucasian Albanian alphabet. As a result of the later political weakening of the State of Caucasian Albania and the Caucasian Albanian Catholicate, the script gradually faded out, and subsequently its usage was discontinued. Currently, the Udi Alphabet uses 52 letters. The first Udi school and then, subsequently, a Russian rural school, was opened in Nij in 1854. Subsequently, a Russian rural school was established. From 1931 to 1933, Udis received education in their own language; in 1937 they began to receive education in the Azeri language. The settlement of Nij is a unique district, with its unusual planning layout, transport systems, and its public, private and religious buildings. Nij is also a unique place, as various ethnic and religious groups co-existed throughout the centuries. The settlement of Nij is divided into several quarters, based on the family relationships of its residents. Practically all the names of these quarters are in the Azeri language - such as Hajibayli, Darabag, Daramahla, Vazirli, Farimli, Malbel, Agdamekli, Melikli, Falshyly, Manjyly, Delekli, Chirmakhli and Abdally. As in their past, Udis are today involved in a variety of vocations, which include farming, cattle breeding, rice cultivation, sericulture, horticulture, poultry farming, craftsmanship and viticulture. Many Udi ceremonies, rites, and calendar days of the Udis are linked to farming. Traditional ceremonies, rites, beliefs and traditions are the integral elements of an intangible cultural heritage. This is mostly reflected in the names and observance of national holidays. One such holiday is called Comrad, and is celebrated near a church, whereby, according to the tradition, the sacrifice of a black sheep is required. It is worth noting that this rite is similar to the Gurban Holiday (Eid al-Adha) ‚Äì a sacred holiday of Islam, widely celebrated by Azerbaijanis. One of the popular holidays of the Udi people is Zhogulun Akhsibay, celebrated on the arrival of Spring. On that day, each family cooks a meal called kherse, paints eggs and jumps over bonfires. Many elements of this holiday are similar to those of the Novruz (Spring) Holiday of Azerbaijan. These unique features of the Udis‚Äô cultural heritage have, in the past, been observed by many scholars and travellers who visited Nij. Throughout the 19th century, information about the Udis, and particularly their language, was studied and published by Russian and Western researchers. Alexandre Dumas p√®re, the French writer, in his book Voyage to the Caucasus (1859), provides detailed information about the specific economic activities, language and culture of the Udis living in Nij.

Background and initial airstrikes  Gori is a strategic city in central Georgia, about from Tskhinvali. Gori is a major military installation and transportation hub in Georgia. 75 tanks and armored personnel carriers (a third of the Georgian military's arsenal) were assembled near Gori on 7 August. Around 6:27 AM on 9 August 2008, Reuters reported that two Russian fighters had bombed a Georgian artillery position about 10 km north of Gori. On 9 August, a Russian air attack targeted military barracks in Gori. In the resulting explosion, besides the base, several apartment buildings and a school were also damaged. The Georgian government reported that 60 civilians were killed when bombs hit the apartment buildings. According to the Russian media, Russian aircraft dropped three bombs on an armament depot, and the fa√ßade of one of the adjacent 5-story apartment buildings suffered damage as a result of exploding ammunition from the depot. Russian aircraft had bombed at least five Georgian cities by 9 August.  Georgian abandonment  A Georgian military base near Gori largely demolished by Russian troops. Destroyed Georgian military base in Gori Following its defeat in Tskhinvali, the Georgian Army regrouped at Gori. Georgian military entered the city on 10 August. On 10 August, BBC reported that people were leaving Gori because they feared of Russian advance towards the city. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and World Food Programme determined that about 80 percent of residents had left Gori as of 10 August. Russians began advancing towards Gori. On 11 August 2008, the Georgian forces retreated from Gori. A senior Georgian security official, Kakha Lomaia, said that the troops were ordered to defend Tbilisi. Police sealed off the highway from Tbilisi, and did not allow any cars into the city. The Russian attacks were met with Georgian artillery firing towards South Ossetia, and at least six Georgian helicopters were reported to have also attacked targets in South Ossetia. A Times reporter described the Georgian withdrawal as \\"sudden and dramatic\\", saying that the \\"residents watched in horror\\" as their army abandoned their positions. Georgian tanks and armored personnel carries fled to Tbilisi. A tank exploded on the mountain road due to unspecified reasons, and an armored car pushing it out of the way also caught fire. Georgian infantry fled the city by any means available. Five soldiers escaped the city on one Quad bike. By late 11 August, Gori was deserted after most remaining residents and Georgian soldiers had fled. Georgia said that Russian forces had captured Gori, but a Reuters witness saw no troops in the empty town. Initial Georgian reports that Russian troops were in Gori, were later discounted by Georgia. Georgian armed forces concentrated on holding Mtskheta, from the capital Tbilisi.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/georgia/2545002/Russian- president-Dimitry-Medvedev-orders-end-to-conflict-in-Georgia.html Deputy Defense Minister Batu Kutelia said that the defense line was being moved to Mtskheta.  The final air attacks  On 12 August 2008, a Dutch television journalist Stan Storimans was killed and another journalist injured when Russian warplanes bombed the city. As a result of the explosion 7 people were killed, over 30 were injured. Georgian officials said Russian forces had been targeting the city's administrative buildings; the university of Gori and its post office were on fire after the bombings. Russia's deputy head of the General Staff, Colonel-General Anatoliy Nogovitsyn, denied that Russian forces had attacked the town. That day, a missile struck the Gori Military Hospital. President Mikheil Saakashvili said his country had been sliced in half with the capture of a critical highway crossroads near Gori. Human Rights Watch (HRW), an international rights group, accused Russia of deploying indiscriminately deadly cluster bombs in civilian areas. HRW said that Russian aircraft had dropped RBK-250 cluster bombs, each containing 30 PTAB 2.5M submunitions or bomblets on the town of Ruisi in the Kareli district of Georgia, on 12 August. On the same day a cluster strike in the centre of Gori killed at least eight civilians, including Stan Storimans and injured dozens. Russian military official denied using cluster munitions, calling the assertion \\"slanderous\\". Numerous unexploded submunitions were subsequently found by local population in the Gori district and the HRW documented them.  Russian occupation  Several hours after the ceasefire agreement was reached, a Russian tank battalion occupied parts of Gori. Rumors of a possible attack on Tbilisi circulated. Russian troops took control of Gori on 13 August 2008. Sergey Lavrov said that when Georgian troops abandoned their military headquarters near Gori, they left \\"a major arsenal of armaments and military equipment\\" and the Russian troops were guarding it. Russian troops said they were removing military hardware and ammunition from an arms depot outside Gori. A Russian armored column left Gori, traveling along the main road to Tbilisi. Russian forces then halted their advance and camped out in a field about an hour's drive from Tbilisi. In the morning of 14 August, Georgian police and military vehicles prepared to re-enter Gori after the expected departure of Russian forces. Reports of a collapse in negotiations triggered a confrontation between Georgian and Russian troops at a checkpoint on the main road, however no shots were fired. By the afternoon, Russian tanks had moved in to guard the entrance to town. Russian major general Vyacheslav Borisov told Aleksandre Lomaia, secretary of Georgia's National Security Council, that the residents of Gori were not disturbed by the Russians' presence. Later, Russian forces allowed Georgian police to return. Vyacheslav Borisov claimed that the city of Gori was controlled jointly by Georgian Police and Russian troops. He further said that Russian troops would start leaving Gori in two days. But joint patrols soon broke down because of apparent discord among personnel and the city returned to full Russian control. More than 30 police officers returned to a Georgian post outside the city. Russia's UN ambassador, Vitaly Churkin, denied that Russian troops were occupying Gori, saying that Russian soldiers \\"are not in Gori, have never been in Gori and do not occupy Gori,\\" and rejected the reports that the town was in ruins. Russian forces pushed to about from Tbilisi, the closest during the war; they stopped in Igoeti . The parts of Georgia‚Äôs army, which had manned a narrow front in the immediate vicinity down the road, maintained their positions. The Russian move coincided with the U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice‚Äôs meeting with Georgian president Saakashvili on 15 August. The uniformed Russian troops were followed by the irregular soldiers, identified as Chechen, Cossack and Ossetian \\"volunteers\\". \\"Now Ossetians are running around and killing poor Georgians in their enclaves,\\" said Major-General Vyacheslav Borisov on 14 August. A Russian lieutenant said: \\"We have to be honest. The Ossetians are marauding.\\" Answering a journalist's question, a Russian lieutenant colonel said: \\"We're not a police force, we're a military force. [...] It's not our job to do police work.\\" The New York Times noted, that \\"the Russian military might be making efforts in some places to stop the rampaging\\". The Russian forces denied access to some humanitarian aid missions seeking to assist civilians. The United Nations, which has described the humanitarian situation in Gori as \\"desperate,\\" was able to deliver only limited food supplies to the city. On 17 August, BBC reported that humanitarian aid was being delivered to the city. The Russian commander in Gori said his troops were staying to prevent looting and would leave when Georgian police was ready to take over. In the 17 August report, HRW said the organization's researchers interviewed ethnic Georgians from the city of Gori and surrounding villages who described how armed Ossetian pro-Russian militias attacked their cars and kidnapped civilians who were trying to flee militia attacks on their homes after the Russian advance into the region. Numerous crimes against humanity or war crimes had been committed by Ossetian militias. In phone interviews, people remaining in Gori region villages told HRW that they had witnessed looting and arson attacks by Ossetian militias in their villages, but were afraid to leave after learning about militia attacks on those who fled. According to the Hague Convention, an occupying power has to insure public order and safety in the occupied areas. The Russian human rights group Memorial called the attacks by South Ossetian militia \\"pogroms\\".  Russian pullout of Gori  The last Russian military formations left the city late on 22 August 2008, and Georgian law enforcement units moved into Gori shortly thereafter. Gigi Ugulava, the mayor of Tbilisi, said that the authorities would arrange \\"an organized return\\" of tens of thousands of displaced persons to Gori. The closest Russian checkpoint remaining in the vicinity of Gori was located in the village of Karaleti, five kilometers from the town.

In mathematics, the Riemannian connection on a surface or Riemannian 2-manifold refers to several intrinsic geometric structures discovered by Tullio Levi-Civita, √âlie Cartan and Hermann Weyl in the early part of the twentieth century: parallel transport, covariant derivative and connection form . These concepts were put in their current form with principal bundles only in the 1950s. The classical nineteenth century approach to the differential geometry of surfaces, due in large part to Carl Friedrich Gauss, has been reworked in this modern framework, which provides the natural setting for the classical theory of the moving frame as well as the Riemannian geometry of higher-dimensional Riemannian manifolds. This account is intended as an introduction to the theory of connections. Historical overview Tullio Levi-Civita (1873-1941) √âlie Cartan (1869-1951) Hermann Weyl (1885-1955) After the classical work of Gauss on the differential geometry of surfaces and the subsequent emergence of the concept of Riemannian manifold initiated by Bernhard Riemann in the mid-nineteenth century, the geometric notion of connection developed by Tullio Levi-Civita, √âlie Cartan and Hermann Weyl in the early twentieth century represented a major advance in differential geometry. The introduction of parallel transport, covariant derivatives and connection forms gave a more conceptual and uniform way of understanding curvature, allowing generalisations to higher-dimensional manifolds; this is now the standard approach in graduate-level textbooks. It also provided an important tool for defining new topological invariants called characteristic classes via the Chern‚ÄìWeil homomorphism., Chapter XII. Although Gauss was the first to study the differential geometry of surfaces in Euclidean space E3, it was not until Riemann's Habilitationsschrift of 1854 that the notion of a Riemannian space was introduced. Christoffel introduced his eponymous symbols in 1869. Tensor calculus was developed by Ricci, who published a systematic treatment with Levi-Civita in 1901. Covariant differentiation of tensors was given a geometric interpretation by who introduced the notion of parallel transport on surfaces. His discovery prompted Weyl and Cartan to introduce various notions of connection, including in particular that of affine connection. Cartan's approach was rephrased in the modern language of principal bundles by Ehresmann, after which the subject rapidly took its current form following contributions by Chern, Ambrose and Singer, Kobayashi, Nomizu, Lichnerowicz and others. Connections on a surface can be defined in a variety of ways. The Riemannian connection or Levi-Civita connection is perhaps most easily understood in terms of lifting vector fields, considered as first order differential operators acting on functions on the manifold, to differential operators on sections of the frame bundle. In the case of an embedded surface, this lift is very simply described in terms of orthogonal projection. Indeed, the vector bundles associated with the frame bundle are all sub-bundles of trivial bundles that extend to the ambient Euclidean space; a first order differential operator can always be applied to a section of a trivial bundle, in particular to a section of the original sub- bundle, although the resulting section might no longer be a section of the sub-bundle. This can be corrected by projecting orthogonally. The Riemannian connection can also be characterized abstractly, independently of an embedding. The equations of geodesics are easy to write in terms of the Riemannian connection, which can be locally expressed in terms of the Christoffel symbols. Along a curve in the surface, the connection defines a first order differential equation in the frame bundle. The monodromy of this equation defines parallel transport for the connection, a notion introduced in this context by Levi-Civita. This gives an equivalent, more geometric way of describing the connection as lifting paths in the manifold to paths in the frame bundle. This formalises the classical theory of the \\"moving frame\\", favoured by French authors. Lifts of loops about a point give rise to the holonomy group at that point. The Gaussian curvature at a point can be recovered from parallel transport around increasingly small loops at the point. Equivalently curvature can be calculated directly infinitesimally in terms of Lie brackets of lifted vector fields. The approach of Cartan, using connection 1-forms on the frame bundle of M, gives a third way to understand the Riemannian connection, which is particularly easy to describe for an embedded surface. Thanks to a result of , later generalized by , the Riemannian connection on a surface embedded in Euclidean space E3 is just the pullback under the Gauss map of the Riemannian connection on S2. Using the identification of S2 with the homogeneous space SO(3)/SO(2), the connection 1-form is just a component of the Maurer‚ÄìCartan 1-form on SO(3). In other words, everything reduces to understanding the 2-sphere properly. This approach, together with its higher-dimensional generalisations, is discussed in great detail in Chapters 1 and 2. Covariant derivative A vector field on the torus For a surface M embedded in E3 (or more generally a higher- dimensional Euclidean space), there are several equivalent definitions of a vector field X on M: * a smooth map of M into E3 taking values in the tangent space at each point; * the velocity vector of a local flow on M; * a first order differential operator without constant term in any local chart on M; * a derivation of C‚àû(M). The last condition means that the assignment f Xf on C‚àû(M) satisfies the Leibniz rule :X(fg)= (Xf)g + f(Xg). The space of all vector fields \\\\mathcal{X}(M) forms a module over C‚àû(M), closed under the Lie bracket :[X,Y]f= X(Yf) - Y(Xf) with a C‚àû(M)-valued inner product (X,Y), which encodes the Riemannian metric on M. Since \\\\mathcal{X}(M) is a submodule of C‚àû(M, E3)=C‚àû(M)\\\\otimes E3, the operator X\\\\otimes I is defined on \\\\mathcal{X}(M), taking values in C‚àû(M, E3). Let P be the smooth map from M into M3(R) such that P(p) is the orthogonal projection of E3 onto the tangent space at p. Thus for the unit normal vector nn at p, uniquely defined up to a sign, and v in E3, the projection is given by (p)(v) = v - (v ¬∑ np) np. Pointwise multiplication by P gives a C‚àû(M)-module map of C‚àû(M, E3) onto \\\\mathcal{X}(M) . The assignment :{ border=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\"  abla_X Y = P((X\\\\otimes I)Y) } defines an operator abla_X on \\\\mathcal{X}(M) called the covariant derivative, satisfying the following properties # abla_X is C‚àû(M)-linear in X # abla_X(fY) = (Xf) Y + f abla_X Y (Leibniz rule for derivation of a module) # X(Y,Z)=( abla_X Y,Z) + (Y, abla_X Z) (compatibility with the metric) # abla_X Y - abla_Y X = [X,Y] (symmetry property). The first three properties state that abla is an affine connection compatible with the metric, sometimes also called a hermitian or metric connection. The last symmetry property says that the torsion tensor : T(X,Y)= abla_X Y - abla_Y X - [X,Y] vanishes identically, so that the affine connection is torsion-free. Although the Riemannian connection was defined using an embedding in Euclidean space, this uniqueness property means that it is in fact an intrinsic invariant of the surface. Its existence can be proved directly for a general surface by noting that the four properties imply the Koszul formula :2( abla_X Y,Z)= X\\\\cdot(Y,Z)+Y\\\\cdot(X,Z) - Z\\\\cdot(X,Y) +([X,Y],Z) +([Z,X],Y) + (X,[Z,Y]), so that abla_X Y depends only on the metric and is unique. On the other hand, if this is used as a definition of abla_X Y, it is readily checked that the four properties above are satisfied. For an isometric embedding of in E3, the tangent vectors u_1=\\\\partial_x and u_2=\\\\partial_y u yield a 2 \\\\times 2 matrix g_{ij} = u_i\\\\cdot u_j It is a positive-definite matrix. Its inverse is also positive- definite symmetric, with matrix g^{ij}. The inverse also has a unique positive-definite square root, with matrix h_{ij}. It is routine to check that e_i = \\\\sum_{j} h_{ij} u_j form an orthonormal basis of the tangent space. In this case, the projection onto the tangent space is given by P(p)(v) =\\\\sum (v,e_i)e_i so that : abla_{\\\\partial_i}\\\\partial_j u = P(p)(\\\\partial_i\\\\partial_i u) = \\\\sum_k (\\\\partial_i\\\\partial_j u,e_k) e_k = \\\\sum_{k,\\\\ell,m} (\\\\partial_i\\\\partial_j u)\\\\cdot (\\\\partial_\\\\ell u) h_{k\\\\ell}h_{km} \\\\partial_m u= \\\\sum_{\\\\ell,m} (\\\\partial_i\\\\partial_j u)\\\\cdot (\\\\partial_\\\\ell u) g^{\\\\ell m} \\\\partial_m u. Thus abla_{\\\\partial_i}\\\\partial_j =\\\\sum_k \\\\Gamma_{ij}^k \\\\partial_k, where : \\\\Gamma_{ij}^k = {1\\\\over 2} \\\\sum_\\\\ell g^{k\\\\ell} \\\\left(\\\\partial_i(\\\\partial_j u \\\\cdot \\\\partial_\\\\ell u) + \\\\partial_j(\\\\partial_i u\\\\cdot \\\\partial_\\\\ell u) - \\\\partial_\\\\ell(\\\\partial_i u \\\\cdot \\\\partial_j u)\\\\right. Since g_{ij} =u_i \\\\cdot u_j, this gives another way to derive the Christoffel symbols: :\\\\Gamma_{ij}^k = {1\\\\over 2} \\\\sum_\\\\ell g^{k\\\\ell} (\\\\partial_i g_{j\\\\ell} +\\\\partial_j g_{i\\\\ell} -\\\\partial_\\\\ell g_{ij}). Formulas for covariant derivative can be also be derived from local coordinates (x,y) without the use of isometric embeddings. Taking \\\\partial_x and '\\\\partial_y as vector fields, the connection abla can be expressed purely in terms of the metric using the Christoffel symbols: : abla_{\\\\partial_i} \\\\partial_j = \\\\sum_k \\\\Gamma^k_{ij} \\\\partial_k. To derive the formula, the Koszul formula can be applied with , and set to \\\\partial_i's; in that case all the Lie brackets commute.  Curvature operator  The Riemann curvature tensor can be defined by covariant derivatives using the curvature operator: :R(X,Y)= abla_X abla_Y - abla_Y abla_X - abla_{[X,Y]}. Since the assignment (X,Y,Z) \\\\mapsto R(X,Y)Z is C‚àû(M)-linear in each variable, it follows that R(x,Y)p is an endomorphism at p. For X and Y linearly independent tangent vectors at , :K={(R(X,Y)Y,X)\\\\over (X,X)(Y,Y)-(X,Y)^2} is independent of the choice of basis and is called the Gaussian curvature at . The Riemann curvature tensor is given by :R(X,Y,Z,W)=(R(X,Y)Z,W). To check independence of it suffices to note that it does not change under elementary transformations sending (,) to (,), (,) and ( + ,). That in turn relies on the fact that the operator is skew-adjoint. Skew- adjointness entails that = 0 for all , which follows because :(R(X,Y)Z,Z) = X( abla_Y Z, Z) -Y( abla_X Z,Z) - ( abla_{[X,Y]}Z,Z) ={1\\\\over 2}(XY(Z,Z) -YX(Z,Z) -[X,Y](Z,Z))=0.  Geodesics  If c(t) is a path in M, then the Euler equations for c to be a geodesic can be written more compactly as : abla_{\\\\dot{c}} \\\\dot{c} = 0. Parallel transport Parallel transport of a vector around a geodesic triangle on the sphere. The length of the transported vector and the angle it makes with each side remain constant. Given a curve in the Euclidean plane and a vector at the starting point, the vector can be transported along the curve by requiring the moving vector to remain parallel to the original one and of the same length, i.e. it should remain constant along the curve. If the curve is closed, the vector will be unchanged when the starting point is reached again. This is well known not to be possible on a general surface, the sphere being the most familiar case. In fact it is not usually possible to identify simultaneously or \\"parallelize\\" all the tangent planes of such a surface: the only parallelizable closed surfaces are those homeomorphic to a torus. Parallel transport can always be defined along curves on a surface using only the metric on the surface. Thus tangent planes along a curve can be identified using the intrinsic geometry, even when the surface itself is not parallelizable. Parallel transport along geodesics, the \\"straight lines\\" of the surface, is easy to define. A vector in the tangent plane is transported along a geodesic as the unique vector field with constant length and making a constant angle with the velocity vector of the geodesic. For a general curve, its geodesic curvature measures how far the curve departs from being a geodesics; it is defined as the rate at which the curve's velocity vector rotates in the surface. In turn the geodesic curvature determines how vectors in the tangent planes along the curve should rotate during parallel transport. A vector field v(t) along a unit speed curve c(t), with geodesic curvature kg(t), is said to be parallel along the curve if * it has constant length * the angle Œ∏(t) that it makes with the velocity vector \\\\dot{c}(t) satisfies ::{ border=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\"  \\\\dot{\\\\theta}(t) = - k_g(t) } This yields the previous rule for parallel transport along a geodesic, because in that case kg = 0, so the angle Œ∏(t) should remain constant. The existence of parallel transport follows from standard existence theorems for ordinary differential equations. The above differential equation can be rewritten in terms of the covariant derivative as ::{ border=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\"  abla_{\\\\dot{c}} v = 0 } This equation shows once more that parallel transport depends only on the metric structure so is an intrinsic invariant of the surface. Parallel transport can be extended immediately to piecewise C1 curves. When M is a surface embedded in E3, this last condition can be written in terms of the projection-valued function P as ::{ border=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\"  P(c(t)) \\\\dot{v}(t)=0 } or in other words:A fuller discussion is given in the section on embedded surfaces. Arnold has suggested, Appendix I. that since parallel transport on a geodesic segment is easy to describe, parallel transport on an arbitrary C1 curve could be constructed as a limit of parallel transport on an approximating family of piecewise geodesic curves.Arnold's method of approximation also applies to higher-dimensional Riemannian manifolds, after having given an appropriate geometric description of parallel transport along a geodesic. Parallel transport can be shown to be a continuous function on the Sobolev space of paths of finite energy, introduced in . In this case the ordinary differential equation \\\\theta_t= a(t) is solved by an integral which depends continuously on a as a varies through piecewise continuous or even just square integrable functions. The higher-dimensional case requires the transport equation gt = A g and an extension of the analysis in . This equation shows once more that parallel transport depends only on the metric structure so is an intrinsic invariant of the surface; it is another way of writing the ordinary differential equation involving the geodesic curvature of c. Parallel transport can be extended immediately to piecewise C1 curves. The covariant derivative can in turn be recovered from parallel transport. In fact abla_X Y can be calculated at a point p, by taking a curve c through p with tangent X, using parallel transport to view the restriction of Y to c as a function in the tangent space at p and then taking the derivative. Orthonormal frame bundle Let M be a surface embedded in E3. The orientation on the surface means that an \\"outward pointing\\" normal unit vector n is defined at each point of the surface and hence a determinant can be defined on tangent vectors v and w at that point: :\\\\mathrm{det}({\\\\mathbf v}, {\\\\mathbf w}) = ({\\\\mathbf v} \\\\times {\\\\mathbf w})\\\\cdot {\\\\mathbf n}, using the usual scalar triple product on E3 (itself a determinant). An ordered basis or frame v, w in the tangent space is said to be oriented if det(v, w) is positive. *The tangent bundle of M consists of pairs (p, v) in M x E3 such that v lies in the tangent plane to M at p. *The frame bundle E of M consists of triples (p, e1, e2) with an e1, e2 an oriented orthonormal basis of the tangent plane at p. *The circle bundle of M consists of pairs (p, v) with v = 1. It is identical to the frame bundle because, for each unit tangent vector v, there is a unique tangent vector w with det(v, w) = 1. Since the group of rotations in the plane SO(2) acts simply transitively on oriented orthonormal frames in the plane, it follows that it also acts on the frame or circle bundles of M. The definitions of the tangent bundle, the unit tangent bundle and the (oriented orthonormal) frame bundle E can be extended to arbitrary surfaces in the usual way. There is a similar identification between the latter two which again become principal SO(2)-bundles. In other words: There is also a corresponding notion of parallel transport in the setting of frame bundles: This statement means that any frame on a curve can be parallelly transported along the curve. This is precisely the idea of \\"moving frames\\". Since any unit tangent vector can be completed uniquely to an oriented frame, parallel transport of tangent vectors implies (and is equivalent to) parallel transport of frames. The lift of a geodesic in M turns out to be a geodesic in E for the Sasaki metric (see below). Moreover, the Gauss map of M into S2 induces a natural map between the associated frame bundles which is equivariant for the actions of SO(2). Cartan's idea of introducing the frame bundle as a central object was the natural culmination of the theory of moving frames, developed in France by Darboux and Goursat. It also echoed parallel developments in Albert Einstein's theory of relativity. Objects appearing in the formulas of Gauss, such as the Christoffel symbols, can be given a natural geometric interpretation in this framework. Unlike the more intuitive normal bundle, easily visualised as a tubular neighbourhood of an embedded surface in E3, the frame bundle is an intrinsic invariant that can be defined independently of an embedding. When there is an embedding, it can also be visualised as a subbundle of the Euclidean frame bundle E3 x SO(3), itself a submanifold of E3 x M3(R). Principal connection The theory of connections according to √âlie Cartan, and later Charles Ehresmann, revolves around:The definition presented here is due essentially to Charles Ehresmann. However, it is different from, though related to, what is commonly called an Ehresmann connection. It is also different from, though related to, what is commonly called a Cartan connection. See and for a survey of some of the various types of connections and the relations between them. * a principal bundle E; * the exterior differential calculus of differential forms on E. All \\"natural\\" vector bundles associated with the manifold M, such as the tangent bundle, the cotangent bundle or the exterior bundles, can be constructed from the frame bundle using the representation theory of the structure group K = SO(2), a compact matrix group. Cartan's definition of a connection can be understood as a way of lifting vector fields on M to vector fields on the frame bundle E invariant under the action of the structure group K. Since parallel transport has been defined as a way of lifting piecewise C1 paths from M to E, this automatically induces infinitesimally a way to lift vector fields or tangent vectors from M to E. At a point take a path with given tangent vector and then map it to the tangent vector of the lifted path. (For vector fields the curves can be taken to be the integral curves of a local flow.) In this way any vector field X on M can be lifted to a vector field X* on E satisfying * X* is a vector field on E; * the map X X* is C‚àû(M)-linear; * X* is K-invariant and induces the vector field X on C‚àû(M) \\\\subset C‚àû(E). Here K acts as a periodic flow on E, so the canonical generator A of its Lie algebra acts as the corresponding vector field, called the vertical vector field A*. It follows from the above conditions that, in the tangent space of an arbitrary point in E, the lifts X* span a two-dimensional subspace of horizontal vectors, forming a complementary subspace to the vertical vectors. The canonical Riemannian metric on E of Shigeo Sasaki is defined by making the horizontal and vertical subspaces orthogonal, giving each subspace its natural inner product. Horizontal vector fields admit the following characterisation: * Every K-invariant horizontal vector field on E has the form X* for a unique vector field X on M. This \\"universal lift\\" then immediately induces lifts to vector bundles associated with E and hence allows the covariant derivative, and its generalisation to forms, to be recovered. If œÉ is a representation of K on a finite-dimensional vector space V, then the associated vector bundle E XK V over M has a C‚àû(M)-module of sections that can be identified with : C^\\\\infty(E,V)^K, the space of all smooth functions Œæ : E ‚Üí V which are K-equivariant in the sense that : \\\\xi(x\\\\cdot g) = \\\\sigma(g^{-1})\\\\xi(x) for all x ‚àà E and g ‚àà K. The identity representation of SO(2) on R2 corresponds to the tangent bundle of M. The covariant derivative abla_X is defined on an invariant section Œæ by the formula :{ border=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\"  abla_X \\\\xi= (X^*\\\\otimes I)\\\\xi. } The connection on the frame bundle can also be described using K-invariant differential 1-forms on E. A general connection on a principal bundle E with structure group H is described by a 1-form on E with values in \\\\mathfrak h invariant under the tensor product of the action of H on 1-forms and the adjoint action. For surfaces, H is Abelian and 1-dimensional, so the connection 1-form is essentially given by an invariant 1-form on E. The frame bundle E is a 3-manifold. The space of p-forms on E is denoted Œõp(E).The space of p-forms can be identified with the space of alternating p-fold C‚àû(E)-multilinear maps on the module of vector fields. For further details see , pages 19-21. It admits a natural action of the structure group K. Given a connection on the principal bundle E corresponding to a lift X X* of vector fields on M, there is a unique connection form œâ in :\\\\Lambda^1(E)^K, the space of K-invariant 1-forms on E, such that : \\\\omega(X^*)= 0 for all vector fields X on M and : \\\\omega(A^*)= 1, for the vector field A* on E corresponding to the canonical generator A of \\\\mathfrak k. Conversely the lift X* is uniquely characterised by the following properties: * X* is K-invariant and induces X on M; * œâ(X*)=0. Cartan structural equations On the frame bundle E of a surface M there are three canonical 1-forms: * The connection form œâ, invariant under the structure group K = SO(2) * Two tautologous 1-forms Œ∏1 and Œ∏2, transforming according to the basis vectors of the identity representation of K If œÄ: E \\\\rightarrow M is the nature projection, the 1-forms Œ∏1 and Œ∏2 are defined by :\\\\theta_i(Y) = (d\\\\pi(Y), e_i) where Y is a vector field on E and e1, e2 are the tangent vectors to M of the orthonormal frame. These 1-forms satisfy the following structural equations, due in this formulation to Cartan: :{ border=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\" d\\\\theta_1 = \\\\omega\\\\wedge\\\\theta_2, \\\\,\\\\, d\\\\theta_2= - \\\\omega\\\\wedge \\\\theta_1 } (First structural equations) :{ border=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\"  d\\\\omega= -(K\\\\circ \\\\pi)\\\\theta_1\\\\wedge\\\\theta_2 }(Second structural equation) where K is the Gaussian curvature on M. Holonomy and curvature Parallel transport in the frame bundle can be used to show that the Gaussian curvature of a surface M measures the amount of rotation obtained by translating vectors around small curves in M. Holonomy is exactly the phenomenon that occurs when a tangent vector (or orthonormal frame) is parallelly transported around a closed curve. The vector reached when the loop is closed will be a rotation of the original vector, i.e. it will correspond to an element of the rotation group SO(2), in other words an angle modulo 2œÄ. This is the holonomy of the loop, because the angle does not depend on the choice of starting vector. Geometric interpretation of the Lie bracket of two vector fields This geometric interpretation of curvature relies on a similar geometric of the Lie bracket of two vector fields on E. Let U1 and U2 be vector fields on E with corresponding local flows Œ±t and Œ≤t. *Starting at a point A corresponding to x in E, travel \\\\sqrt{s} along the integral curve for U1 to the point B at \\\\alpha_{\\\\sqrt{s}}(x). * Travel from B by going \\\\sqrt{s} along the integral curve for U2 to the point C at \\\\beta_{\\\\sqrt{s}} \\\\alpha_{\\\\sqrt{s}}(x). * Travel from C by going -\\\\sqrt{s} along the integral curve for U1 to the point D at \\\\alpha_{-\\\\sqrt{s}}\\\\beta_{\\\\sqrt{s}} \\\\alpha_{\\\\sqrt{s}}(x). * Travel from D by going -\\\\sqrt{s} along the integral curve for U2 to the point E at \\\\beta_{-\\\\sqrt{s}}\\\\alpha_{-\\\\sqrt{s}} \\\\beta_{\\\\sqrt{s}} \\\\alpha_{\\\\sqrt{s}}(x). In general the end point E will differ from the starting point A. As s \\\\rightarrow 0, the end point E will trace out a curve through A. The Lie bracket [U1,U2] at x is precisely the tangent vector to this curve at A. To apply this theory, introduce vector fields U1, U2 and V on the frame bundle E which are dual to the 1-forms Œ∏1, Œ∏2 and œâ at each point. Thus : \\\\omega(U_i)=0, \\\\, \\\\theta_i(V) =0,\\\\, \\\\omega(V)=1,\\\\, \\\\theta_i(U_j)=\\\\delta_{ij}. Moreover, V is invariant under K and U1, U2 transform according to the identity representation of K. The structural equations of Cartan imply the following Lie bracket relations: :{ border=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\" [V,U_1]=U_2, \\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, [V,U_2]=-U_1, \\\\,\\\\,\\\\, \\\\, [U_1,U_2]=(K\\\\circ\\\\pi) V } The geometrical interpretation of the Lie bracket can be applied to the last of these equations. Since œâ(Ui)=0, the flows Œ±t and Œ≤t in E are lifts by parallel transport of their projections in M. Informally the idea is as follows. The starting point A and end point E essentially differ by an element of SO(2), that is an angle of rotation. The area enclosed by the projected path in M is approximately \\\\sqrt{s}\\\\cdot\\\\sqrt{s}=s. So in the limit as s \\\\rightarrow 0, the angle of rotation divided by this area tends to the coefficient of V, i.e. the curvature. This reasoning is made precise in the following result. In symbols, the holonomy angle mod 2œÄ is given by :{ border=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\" \\\\theta= \\\\int_{f(\\\\Delta)} K } where the integral is with respect to the area form on M. This result implies the relation between Gaussian curvature because as the triangle shrinks in size to a point, the ratio of this angle to the area tends to the Gaussian curvature at the point. The result can be proved by a combination of Stokes's theorem and Cartan's structural equations and can in turn be used to obtain a generalisation of Gauss's theorem on geodesics triangles to more general triangles. One of the other standard approaches to curvature, through the covariant derivative abla_X, identifies the difference :R(X,Y)= abla_X abla_Y - abla_Y abla_X - abla_{[X,Y]} as a field of endomorphisms of the tangent bundle, the Riemann curvature tensor. Since abla_X is induced by the lifted vector field X* on E, the use of the vector fields Ui and V and their Lie brackets is more or less equivalent to this approach. The vertical vector field W=A* corresponding to the canonical generator A of \\\\mathfrak k could also be added since it commutes with V and satisfies [W,U1] = U2 and [W,U2] = ‚ÄîU1. Example: the 2-sphere The differential geometry of the 2-sphere can be approached from three different points of view: * analytic geometry, since the 2-sphere is a submanifold of E3; * group theory, since the compact matrix group SO(3) acts transitively on the 2-sphere as a continuous group of symmetries; * classical mechanics, since a rigid 2-sphere can roll on a plane. S2 can be identified with the unit sphere in E3 :S^2=\\\\\\\\{a\\\\in E^3\\\\colon\\\\a\\\\=1\\\\\\\\}. Its tangent bundle T, unit tangent bundle U and oriented orthonormal frame bundle E are given by :T=\\\\\\\\{(a,v)\\\\colon \\\\a\\\\=1,\\\\, a\\\\cdot v=0\\\\\\\\}, :U=\\\\\\\\{(a,v)\\\\colon\\\\a\\\\=1, \\\\,\\\\v\\\\=1,\\\\, a\\\\cdot v=0\\\\\\\\}, : E=\\\\\\\\{(a,e_1,e_2)\\\\colon (e_1 \\\\times e_2)\\\\cdot a=1, \\\\, \\\\a\\\\=1, \\\\, \\\\e_i\\\\=1, \\\\, a\\\\cdot e_i = 0, \\\\, e_1\\\\cdot e_2=0 \\\\\\\\}. The map sending (a,v) to (a, v, a x v) allows U and E to be identified. Let :Q(a)v= (v\\\\cdot a) a be the orthogonal projection onto the normal vector at a, so that :P(a) = I-Q(a) is the orthogonal projection onto the tangent space at a. The group G = SO(3) acts by rotation on E3 leaving S2 invariant. The stabilizer subgroup K of the vector (1,0,0) in E3 may be identified with SO(2) and hence This action extends to an action on T, U and E by making G act on each component. G acts transitively on S2 and simply transitively on U and E. The action of SO(3) on E commutes with the action of SO(2) on E that rotates frames :(e_1,e_2)\\\\mapsto (\\\\cos \\\\theta \\\\, e_1 - \\\\sin \\\\theta \\\\,e_2, \\\\sin \\\\theta\\\\, e_1 + \\\\cos \\\\theta \\\\,e_2). Thus E becomes a principal bundle with structure group K. Taking the G-orbit of the point ((1,0,0),(0,1,0),(0,0,1)), the space E may be identified with G. Under this identification the actions of G and K on E become left and right translation. In other words: The Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak g of SO(3) consists of all skew-symmetric real 3 x 3 matrices.The Lie algebra of a closed connected subgroup G of a real or complex general linear group consists of all matrices X such that exp tX lies in G for all real t; see or . the adjoint action of G by conjugation on \\\\mathfrak g reproduces the action of G on E3. The group SU(2) has a 3-dimensional Lie algebra consisting of complex skew-hermitian traceless 2 x 2 matrices, which is isomorphic to \\\\mathfrak g. The adjoint action of SU(2) factors through its centre, the matrices ¬± I. Under these identifications, SU(2) is exhibited as a double cover of SO(3), so that SO(3) = SU(2) / ¬± I.Geometrically this double cover corresponds to a spin structure on S2. On the other hand, SU(2) is diffeomorphic to the 3-sphere and under this identification the standard Riemannian metric on the 3-sphere becomes the essentially unique biinvariant Riemannian metric on SU(2). Under the quotient by ¬± I, SO(3) can be identified with the real projective space of dimension 3 and itself has an essentially unique biinvariant Riemannian metric. The geometric exponential map for this metric at I coincides with the usual exponential function on matrices and thus the geodesics through I have the form exp Xt where X is a skew-symmetric matrix. In this case the Sasaki metric agrees with this biinvariant metric on SO(3)., Appendix 2: Geodesics of left- invariant metrics on Lie groups and the hydrodynamics of ideal fluids. The actions of G on itself, and hence on C‚àû(G) by left and right translation induce infinitesimal actions of \\\\mathfrak g on C‚àû(G) by vector fields :\\\\lambda(X) f(g)={d\\\\over dt}f(e^{-Xt}g)_{t=0},\\\\,\\\\, \\\\rho(X) f(g)={d\\\\over dt}f(ge^{Xt})_{t=0}. The right and left invariant vector fields are related by the formula : \\\\lambda(X)f(g)=-\\\\rho(g^{-1}Xg)f(g). The vector fields Œª(X) and œÅ(X) commute with right and left translation and give all right and left invariant vector fields on G. Since C‚àû(S2) = C‚àû(G/K) can be identified with C‚àû(G)K, the function invariant under right translation by K, the operators Œª(X) also induces vector fields Œ†(X) on S2. Let A, B, C be the standard basis of \\\\mathfrak g given by : A= \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0\\\\end{pmatrix},\\\\,\\\\,B=\\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & -1 & 0\\\\end{pmatrix}, \\\\,\\\\, C=\\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -1 & 0 & 0\\\\end{pmatrix}. Their Lie brackets [X,Y] = XY ‚Äì YX are given by :[A,B]=C,\\\\,\\\\,[B,C]=A,\\\\,\\\\, [C,A]=B. The vector fields Œª(A), Œª(B), Œª(C) form a basis of the tangent space at each point of G. Similarly the left invariant vector fields œÅ(A), œÅ(B), œÅ(C) form a basis of the tangent space at each point of G. Let Œ±, Œ≤, Œ≥ be the corresponding dual basis of left invariant 1-forms on G. The Lie bracket relations imply the Maurer‚ÄìCartan equations : d\\\\alpha =\\\\beta\\\\wedge \\\\gamma,\\\\,\\\\, d\\\\beta= \\\\gamma\\\\wedge \\\\alpha, \\\\,\\\\, d\\\\gamma=\\\\alpha\\\\wedge\\\\beta. These are also the corresponding components of the Maurer‚ÄìCartan form :\\\\omega_G=g^{-1}dg, a left invariant matrix-valued 1-form on G, which satisfies the relation : d\\\\omega_G = -(g^{-1} dg\\\\, g^{-1})dg = -\\\\omega_G\\\\wedge \\\\omega_G. The inner product on \\\\mathfrak g defined by :(X,Y)= \\\\mathrm{Tr}\\\\, XY^T is invariant under the adjoint action. Let œÄ be the orthogonal projection onto the subspace generated by A, i.e. onto \\\\mathfrak k, the Lie algebra of K. For X in \\\\mathfrak g, the lift of the vector field Œ†(X) from C‚àû(G/K) to C‚àû(G) is given by the formula :{ border=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\"  \\\\Pi(X)^* f(g) = -\\\\rho(\\\\pi(g^{-1}Xg))f(g) } This lift is G-equivariant on vector fields of the form Œ†(X) and has a unique extension to more general vector fields on G / K. The left invariant 1-form Œ± is the connection form œâ on G corresponding to this lift. The other two 1-forms in the Cartan structural equations are given by Œ∏1 = Œ≤ and Œ∏2 = Œ≥. The structural equations themselves are just the Maurer‚ÄìCartan equations. In other words; Since Œ± is the connection form, *vertical vector fields on G are those of the form f ¬∑ Œª(A) with f in C‚àû(G); *horizontal vector fields on G are those of the form f1 ¬∑ Œª(B) + f2 ¬∑ Œª(C) with fi in C‚àû(G). The existence of the basis vector fields Œª(A), Œª(B), Œª(C) shows that SO(3) is parallelizable. This is not true for SO(3)/SO(2) by the hairy ball theorem: S2 does not admit any nowhere vanishing vector fields. Parallel transport in the frame bundle amounts to lifting a path from SO(3)/SO(2) to SO(3). It can be accomplished by directly solving a matrix-valued ordinary differential equation (\\"transport equation\\") of the form gt = A ¬∑ g where A(t) is skew-symmetric and g takes values in SO(3).This standard treatment of parallel transport can be found for example in .In mathematical physics, the solution of this differential equation is often expressed as a path-ordered exponential; see for example . In fact it is equivalent and more convenient to lift a path from SO(3)/O(2) to SO(3). Note that O(2) is the normaliser of SO(2) in SO(3) and the quotient group O(2)/SO(2), the so-called Weyl group, is a group of order 2 which acts on SO(3)/SO(2) = S2 as the antipodal map. The quotient SO(3)/O(2) is the real projective plane. It can be identified with space of rank one or rank two projections Q in M3(R). Taking Q to be a rank 2 projection and setting F = 2Q ‚àí I, a model of the surface SO(3)/O(2) is given by matrices F satisfying F2 = I, F = FT and Tr F = 1. Taking F0= diag (‚Äì1,1,1) as base point, every F can be written in the form g F0 g‚àí1. If Q(t) is the corresponding path of rank 2 projections, the conditions for parallel transport are : Q = gQ_0 g^{-1},\\\\,\\\\, Q_0 g^{-1} \\\\dot{g} Q_0 = 0 Set A = ¬ΩFt F. Since F2 = I and F is symmetric, A is skew-symmetric and satisfies QAQ = 0\\\\. The unique solution g(t) of the ordinary differential equation : \\\\dot{g} = A g \\\\, with initial condition g(0) = I guaranteed by the Picard‚ÄìLindel√∂f theorem, must have gTg constant and therefore I, since :{d\\\\over dt} (g^T g)= \\\\dot{g}^Tg +g^T\\\\dot{g}= g^T(A^T +A)g=0. Moreover, : F(t) = g(t) F(0) g(t)^{-1} \\\\, since g‚àí1Fg has derivative 0: : {d\\\\over dt} (g^{-1}Fg) = -g^{-1} \\\\dot{g} g^{-1} Fg + g^{-1}\\\\dot{F} g + g^{-1}F\\\\dot{g} = g^{-1}(-\\\\dot{g}g^{-1}F + \\\\dot{F} +F \\\\dot{g}g^{-1})g=0. Hence Q = g Q0 g‚àí1. The condition QAQ=0 implies Q gt g‚àí1 Q = 0 and hence that Q0 g‚àí1 gt Q0 =0.A similar argument applies to the transitive action by conjugation of SU(2) on matrices F = 2Q ‚àí I with Q a rank one projection in M2(C). This action is trivial on ¬± I, so passes to a transitive action of SO(3) with stabilizer subgroup SO(2), showing that these matrices provide another model for S2. This is standard material in gauge theory on SU(2); see for example . There is another kinematic way of understanding parallel transport and geodesic curvature in terms of \\"rolling without slipping or twisting\\". Although well known to differential geometers since the early part of the twentieth century, it has also been applied to problems in engineering and robotics. , Appendix B: Rolling without Slipping or Twisting Consider the 2-sphere as a rigid body in three-dimensional space rolling without slipping or twisting on a horizontal plane. The point of contact will describe a curve in the plane and on the surface. At each point of contact the different tangent planes of the sphere can be identified with the horizontal plane itself and hence with one another. *The usual curvature of the planar curve is the geodesic curvature of the curve traced on the sphere. *This identification of the tangent planes along the curve corresponds to parallel transport. This is particularly easy to visualize for a sphere: it is exactly the way a marble can be rolled along a perfectly flat table top. The roles of the plane and the sphere can be reversed to provide an alternative but equivalent point of view. The sphere is regarded as fixed and the plane has to roll without slipping or twisting along the given curve on the sphere. Embedded surfaces When a surface M is embedded in E3, the Gauss map from M \\\\rightarrow S2 extends to a SO(2)-equivariant map between the orthonormal frame bundles E \\\\rightarrow SO(3). Indeed, the triad consisting of the tangent frame and the normal vector gives an element of SO(3). In 1956 Kobayashi proved that:, Theorem II. This means that the forms œâ, Œ∏1 and Œ∏2 on E are obtained by pulling back those on SO(3); and that lifting paths from M to E can be accomplished by mapping the path to the 2-sphere, lifting the path to SO(3) and then pulling back the lift to E. Thus for embedded surfaces, the 2-sphere with the principal connection on its frame bundle provides a \\"universal model\\", the prototype for the universal bundles discussed in . In more concrete terms this allows parallel transport to be described explicitly using the transport equation. Parallel transport along a curve c(t), with t taking values in [0,1], starting from a tangent from a tangent vector v0 also amounts to finding a map v(t) from [0,1] to R3 such that * v(t) is a tangent vector to M at c(t) with v(0) = v0. * the velocity vector \\\\dot{v}(t) is normal to the surface at c(t), i.e. P(c(t))v(t)=0. This always has a unique solution, called the parallel transport of v0 along c. The existence of parallel transport can be deduced using the analytic method described for SO(3)/SO(2), which from a path into the rank two projections Q(t) starting at Q0 produced a path g(t) in SO(3) starting at I such that :Q = g Q_0 g^{-1}, \\\\, \\\\, \\\\,Q_0 g^{-1} \\\\dot{g} Q_0= 0. g(t) is the unique solution of the transport equation :{ border=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\" gtg‚àí1 = ¬Ω Ft F } with g(0) = I and F = 2Q ‚àí I. Applying this with Q(t) = P(c(t)), it follows that, given a tangent vector v0 in the tangent space to M at c(0), the vector v(t)=g(t)v0 lies in the tangent space to M at c(t) and satisfies the equation :P(c(t))\\\\dot{v}(t) =0. It therefore is exactly the parallel transport of v along the curve c. In this case the length of the vector v(t) is constant. More generally if another initial tangent vector u0 is taken instead of v0, the inner product (v(t),u(t)) is constant. The tangent spaces along the curve c(t) are thus canonically identified as inner product spaces by parallel transport so that parallel transport gives an isometry between the tangent planes. The condition on the velocity vector \\\\dot{v}(t) may be rewritten in terms of the covariant derivative as :{ border=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\"  abla_{\\\\dot{c}} v = 0 } the defining equation for parallel transport. The kinematic way of understanding parallel transport for the sphere applies equally well to any closed surface in E3 regarded as a rigid body in three- dimensional space rolling without slipping or twisting on a horizontal plane. The point of contact will describe a curve in the plane and on the surface. As for the sphere, the usual curvature of the planar curve equals the geodesic curvature of the curve traced on the surface. This geometric way of viewing parallel transport can also be directly expressed in the language of geometry. The envelope of the tangent planes to M along a curve c is a surface with vanishing Gaussian curvature, which by Minding's theorem, must be locally isometric to the Euclidean plane. This identification allows parallel transport to be defined, because in the Euclidean plane all tangent planes are identified with the space itself. There is another simple way of constructing the connection form œâ using the embedding of M in E3. The tangent vectors e1 and e2 of a frame on M define smooth functions from E with values in R3, so each gives a 3-vector of functions and in particular de1 is a 3-vector of 1-forms on E. The connection form is given by :{ border=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\" \\\\omega= de_1 \\\\cdot e_2 } taking the usual scalar product on 3-vectors. Gauss‚ÄìCodazzi equations When M is embedded in E3, two other 1-forms œà and œá can be defined on the frame bundle E using the shape operator., Chapter 2., Chapter VII. Indeed, the Gauss map induces a K-equivariant map of E into SO(3), the frame bundle of S2 = SO(3)/SO(2). The form œâ is the pullback of one of the three right invariant Maurer‚ÄìCartan forms on SO(3). The 1-forms œà and œá are defined to be the pullbacks of the other two. These 1-forms satisfy the following structure equations: :{ border=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\"  \\\\psi\\\\wedge \\\\theta_1 + \\\\chi\\\\wedge \\\\theta_2=0 }(symmetry equation) :{ border=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\"  d\\\\omega= \\\\psi\\\\wedge \\\\chi }(Gauss equation) :{ border=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\"  d\\\\psi=\\\\chi\\\\wedge\\\\omega, \\\\,\\\\, d\\\\chi=\\\\omega\\\\wedge\\\\psi }(Codazzi equations) The Gauss‚ÄìCodazzi equations for œá, œà and œâ follow immediately from the Maurer‚ÄìCartan equations for the three right invariant 1-forms on SO(3).

Early life O'Dea was born in Sydney in 1966 to Michael and Marianne O'Dea, one of nine brothers and sisters. His father served several terms as mayor of North Sydney Council and was awarded the Member of the Order of Australia in 1994. He was educated on the North Shore of Sydney at St Aloysius College and St Ignatius' College, Riverview, and attended the University of Sydney where he gained a Bachelor of Arts, a Bachelor of Laws and a Master of Laws. He has also undertaken further studies and was awarded a Graduate Diploma of Legal Studies and a Master of Business Administration. He is a Fellow of the Australian Institute of Company Directors. While at university, O'Dea was the Vice-President of the University of Sydney Students' Representative Council between 1986 and 1987. Admitted as a solicitor, O'Dea practiced for five years before moving into commercial and senior management roles. He joined the Liberal Party in 1994, serving in numerous capacities, and was elected as a Councillor on North Sydney Council from 1991 until 1995. In addition to his regular work, from 1995 to 2009 he was a non-executive board director with the private health insurer HCF. From 2000 to 2004, O'Dea also served part-time as Deputy Convenor for the Australian Classification Review Board. Political career In 2005 O'Dea was the general manager of the Crown Insurance Group and a director with HCF and was named as a potential candidate for the seat of Pittwater, following the resignation of the sitting member and Opposition leader, John Brogden. However, O'Dea did not stand. In a Liberal Party preselection battle before the 2007 state election, O'Dea defeated the sitting member for Davidson, Andrew Humpherson. Humpherson had cross-factional backing among many delegates, but had lost support in local branches after reportedly instructing party members to quit branches supportive of O'Dea, thereby reducing their voting power. Despite Humpherson having the support of the Party Leader, Peter Debnam, O'Dea won the vote 54 votes to 52 and Humpherson chose to not re- contest the election. In March 2007, O'Dea was elected to Parliament with a majority of 24.7 points. In June 2007, he was appointed a member of the Committee on the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC). From 2008 in Opposition, O'Dea served as the chair of the NSW Coalition WasteWatch Committee. In 2011 he was elected Chair of the crucial cross-party Public Accounts Committee of the NSW Parliament. In September 2009, O'Dea was accused in a local newspaper, the Manly Daily, of failing to adequately represent his constituents, by Ku Ring Gai Councillor Tony Hall, who urged O'Dea to \\"get off his backside\\" and lobby New South Wales Planning Minister Kristina Keneally to protect the area from excessive development. O'Dea responded, defending his record: \\"Along with (Opposition Leader and MP for Ku-ring-gai) Barry O'Farrell I have fought long and hard against inappropriate planning and over development...in the past 12 months I have taken part in 30 formal meetings with authorities and community representatives regarding Ku-ring-gai planning matters, three involved the planning minister and community representatives\\". On 18 October 2010, the Liberal Party announced that O'Dea had been endorsed as the party's candidate for Davidson ahead of the 2011 state election. O'Dea was elected with a swing of 13.8 per cent and won the seat with 86.5 per cent of the vote on a two party preferred basis. His main competitor was Labor's Mathew Gilliland. In 2015 O'Dea was re-elected with 78.8 per cent of the vote on a two party preferred basis, a swing 4.1 per cent against him, defeating the Green's David Sentinella. In 2019 O'Dea was again re-elected with 75.2 per cent of the vote on a two party preferred basis, a swing 3.7 per cent against him, defeating the Green's Felicity Davis. On 28 March 2015, O'Dea was appointed as Parliamentary Secretary for Tourism and Major Events. In April 2016, Premier Baird conferred the additional title of Parliamentary Secretary for Trade and Investment. After the change in Premier to Gladys Berejiklian he was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Premier and Treasurer. At the 2019 state election, O'Dea suffered a small swing against him, but was still reelected with a majority of 75.2 percent against the Greens, making Davidson the safest Liberal seat in Sydney. Following the election, Premier Berejiklian nominated Mr O'Dea as the 40th Speaker of the Legislative Assembly, succeeding Shelley Hancock. The NSW Parliament Legislative Assembly subsequently elected Mr O'Dea as Speaker on 7 May 2019. In line with established parliamentary tradition, Mr O'Dea was ceremonially ‚Äòdragged‚Äô to the Speaker's chair by Premier Berejiklian and Planning Minister, Rob Stokes. Personal life O'Dea resides in the suburb of Lindfield with his wife Jacqueline and their four children.

Reportedly built by Clovis, King of the Franks in 502, it became a centre of religious scholarship in the Middle Ages. It was suppressed at the time of the French Revolution. Front of the Church of the Abbey of St Genevieve, in Paris, in a 19th-century engraving of an 18th-century view. History The Abbey was said to have been founded in 502 by King Clovis I and his queen, Clotilde, in the name of the Holy Apostles, jointly dedicated to Peter and Paul. It was built on Mount Lucotitius, a height on the Left Bank where the forum of the Roman town of Lutetia had been located. In 508, Clovis, King of the Franks, constructed a church there, where he and his wife were later buried in 511 and 545.Saint Genevi√®ve was in the habit of coming to pray there, taking a route commemorated by the name rue de la Montagne-Sainte-Genevi√®ve. At her death in 512, her remains were interred at the abbey church, near the tomb of Clovis. The church, originally dedicated to Saints Peter and Paul, was rededicated to Saint Genevieve, who became the patron saint of Paris. Her relics were kept in the church, and were brought out for solemn processions when dangers threatened the city. The Abbey of Saint Genevieve became a centre of religious scholarship in the Middle Ages.LeBeurre, Alexia, The Patheon- Temple of the Nation (2000), p. 3 Entr√©e √† J√©rusalem, Abbaye Sainte-Genevi√®ve By the 9th century, the basilica had been transformed into an Abbey church, and a large monastery had grown up around it, including a scriptorium for the creation and copying of texts. The first record of the existence of the Sainte-Genevieve library dates from 831, and mentions the donation of three texts to the Abbey. The texts created or copied included works of history and literature, as well as theology, However, in the course of the 9th century, the Vikings raided Paris three times. While the settlement on the Ile-de-la-Cit√© was protected by the river, the abbey of Saint-Genevieve was sacked, and the books lost or carried away.Peyr√©, Yves, La biblioth√®que Sainte-Genevi√®ve √Ä travers les si√®cles (2011), pg. 12 Around 1108, The theology school of the Abbey of Saint Genevieve, was joined together with the School of Notre Dame Cathedral and the school of the Royal Palace to form the future University of Paris. From 1108 to 1113, Peter Abelard taught at the Abbey school. In 1147 secular canons officiated in the church. King Louis VII of France and Pope Eugene III, having witnessed some disorders, determined to restore discipline. At the request of Suger and Bernard of Clairvaux, Gildwin, the first Abbot of St-Victor, sent Odo, the prior of his abbey. There were difficulties, but order finally prevailed and some of the canons joined the reform, the Abbey becoming a house of Canons Regular.Allaria, Anthony. \\"Abbey of Sainte-Genevi√®ve.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 13. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 20 July 2019 Among these was the young William of Paris. At the request of Absalon, Bishop of Roskilde in Denmark, who when a student at Ste-Genevi√®ve's had known him, William was sent to that country to reform the monastery of St. Thomas on the Isle of Eskils√∏. William founded another monastery, which he dedicated to the Holy Paraclete. He died in 1206, and was canonized by Pope Honorius III. It was natural that close relations should exist between Ste-Genevi√®ve and its foundations in Denmark. Peter Sunesen, a young man who made his profession at the abbey, became Bishop of Roskilde; Valdemar, brother of Cnut the Great, died at Ste-Genevi√®ve; and Abbot Stephen of Tournai wrote to William and his friends to obtain lead for the roof of his abbey. Like the Abbey of St-Victor, Ste-Genevi√®ve became a celebrated seat of learning and the site of a great medieval library. St-Victor, Ste-Genevi√®ve, and Notre-Dame were the cradles of the University of Paris. Peter de Ferri√®re, Abbot of St-Victor, was at one time prior of √âpinay, a priory of Ste-Genevi√®ve; William of Auxerre, a professed canon of St-Victor in 1254, held the office of cellarer, and became Abbot of Ste-Genevi√®ve; and Marcel, successively canon at St-Victor and Ste- Genevi√®ve, was in 1198 made Abbot of Cisoing. In later centuries this abbey fell into the hands of abbots in commendam. In the early seventeenth century Cardinal de La Rochefoucauld undertook the reforms required by the Council of Trent. He brought from Senlis Charles Faure (d. 1644), who had already restored the canonical rule in the ancient Abbey of Silvanect. Once more the Rule of St. Augustine was faithfully observed at Ste-Genevi√®ve's which became the mother-house of the Gallican Congr√©gation de France, an association of the Augustinian abbeys called the G√©nov√©fains or \\"Canons Regular of Ste. Genevieve\\". The Tour Clovis By the middle of the seventeenth century the abbot-general of the congregation had under his jurisdiction more than one hundred abbeys and priories. Men like Fronteau, chancellor of the university and author of many works, Laleman, Chapponel, Reginier, Chengot, Beurier, du Moulinet, founder of the national library, and Augustine Hay, a Scotsman who wrote the Scotia sacra and officiated at Holyrood, Scotland, in 1687, were sons of the French congregation. The astronomer Alexandre Guy Pingr√© was librarian of Sainte-Genevi√®ve. In 1744, King Louis XV decided to replace the abbey church, then in poor condition. An immense abbey church over the old crypt was built, to designs by Jacques-Germain Soufflot; in part rebuilt, it serves today as the Panth√©on. The Abbey of Saint Genevieve was renamed as the Panth√©on due to the French Revolution, and the secularization of religion once the revolution started. The Panth√©on was constructed with a united lightness of construction of Gothic churches with the purity and magnificence of Greek architecture. The remodeling of the Abbey of Saint Genevieve was completed right after the French Revolution started in 1790. Architect, Jacques-Germain Soufflot, died in 1789 and his pupil, Jean-Baptiste Rondelet completed the Panth√©on in his absence. The abbey church was devastated during the French Revolution. The architectural lanterns and bells were removed the facade. All of the religious friezes and statues were destroyed in 1791, to be it replaced by statuary and murals on patriotic themes. Lebeurre, Alexia (2011). The Pantheon - Temple of the Nation. Paris: √âditions du Patrimoie. .(2000) pg. 17 The relics of Saint Genevi√®ve were burnt; what could be salvaged were placed at Saint-√âtienne-du-Mont. Institutes In 1636, an religious institute named the \\"Daughters of Ste. Genevi√®ve\\", was founded by Francesca de Blosset, with the object of nursing the sick and teaching young girls. A somewhat similar institute, had been founded under the invocation of the Holy Trinity in 1611 by Marie Bonneau de Rubella Beauharnais de Miramion. These two institutes were united in 1665, and the associates called the Canonesses of Ste. Genevi√®ve. The members took no vows, but merely promised obedience to the rules as long as they remained in the institute. Suppressed during the Revolution, the institute was revived in 1806 by Jeanne-Claude Jacoulet under the name of the Sisters of the Holy Family. Suppression When in 1790 the revolutionary assembly declared all religious vows void, and evicted all of the residents of the monasteries, there were thirty-nine canons at Ste-Genevi√®ve's. This was the end of the abbey and school. To run the new rue Clovis through the site, the building was demolished shortly after 1800, except for the bell tower, called the Tour Clovis, the refectory and the library. The Lyc√©e Henri-IV, built in part with elements of the abbey buildings, occupies the site. The former abbey's library, which had the third-largest collection of books in Europe was transferred to the nearby Sainte-Genevi√®ve Library during the 19th century. Architecture Construction started in 1755 and it included tall corinthian columns and an imposing dome. The floor plan of this church was a greek cross plan, meaning is have a central mass and four arms of equal length. The dome is held up by concealed flying buttresses and light vaulting produced via stone. It could be said that the Abbey of Saint Genivieve was influenced by St. Peter's Basilica, and St. Paul's Cathedral. Architect, Jacques-Germain Soufflot, did not like the Baroque style so that put him at Neoclassism.

Directed by Shane Belcourt, the film went into commercial release in the summer of 2008.Jennie Punter, \\"'I didn't have time to filter': A M√©tis filmmaker reveals the inspiration for his impressive debut feature\\" , The Globe and Mail, August 14, 2008. The film, named for the Mohawk word from which the name of the city of Toronto is derived, stars Duane Murray and Melanie McLaren as Ray Morrin and Jolene Peltier, who meet while in Toronto on business. Ray, a M√©tis cartoonist from Vancouver, is in town to pitch an animated series called Indian Jones to a television network, and Jolene, an Anishinaabe artist from Los Angeles, is in town to paint a portrait of Max (Lorne Cardinal), a local indigenous elder. The film's cast also includes Cheri Maracle, Jeff Geddis, Mike McPhaden, Rae Ellen Bodie, Jonah Allison, Abby Zotz and Tricia Williams. Themes Ray and Jolene experience a common struggle: as creative professionals living in big cities, they share a sense of disconnection from their indigenous heritage. Both struggle with the question of how to live as an indigenous person in an urban setting devoid of many of the stereotypical signifiers of indigenous identity. Neither was raised with the language, religion and customs of their ancestors; Jolene doesn't even know how to pray. Both are also in relationships with non-indigenous partners: Ray, whose girlfriend is pregnant, is ambivalent about becoming a father, while Jolene's husband is dismissive of her search for a deeper sense of her heritage. As their attraction to each other grows, Ray and Jolene are forced to confront the choice of whether to throw away their current lives in order to be together. In a 2008 interview, Belcourt told The Globe and Mail that the film's themes were inspired by conversations with his sister Christi and a friend of hers, Inuit rock singer Lucie Idlout, about how they balanced their own indigenous identities with their urban lifestyles. Production Produced by The Breath Films in conjunction with Braincloud Films, the film was shot in just 19 days and completed on a budget of just $20,000.Thulasi Srikanthan, \\"Caught between two worlds\\", Ottawa Citizen, August 9, 2008. Reviews The film was reviewed by Jason Anderson at Eye Weekly, who wrote \\"The quality of writer-director Shane Belcourt's feature debut ‚Äì named after our city's original Mohawk name ‚Äì is all the more remarkable when you consider that it was made in six months on a measly budget of $20,000. Based on Belcourt's experience as the son of a M√©tis father, the movie portrays the crises of Jolene and Ray (Duane Murray), two thirty-somethings who can't figure out a way to square up their urban lifestyles and material ambitions with what an elder (played by Lorne Cardinal) calls ‚Äúblood memory.‚Äù But for all of Tkaronto's heavy themes, the film has a sense of lightness that makes it one of the year's most appealing local indie features.\\"Eye Weekly, Toronto, written by Jason Anderson, Published October 18th, 2007 References External links 2007 films Canadian films Canadian drama films First Nations films Films set in Toronto Films shot in Toronto ","title":"Tkaronto"},{"id":"18873706","text":"N…ôrimank…ônd or Narimankend may refer to: *N…ôrimank…ônd, Bilasuvar, Azerbaijan *N…ôrimank…ônd, Gadabay, Azerbaijan *N…ôrimank…ônd, Gobustan, Azerbaijan *N…ôrimank…ônd, Sabirabad, Azerbaijan *Qo≈üak…ônd, Azerbaijan ","title":"N…ôrimank…ônd"},{"id":"18873710","text":"Gobustan () is a town and municipality in and the administrative center of the Gobustan Rayon of Azerbaijan.Qobustan Rayon website It has a population of 3,945.

The movie premiered August 23, 2008, and was to be a pilot that would become a part of the Hallmark Channel Mystery Wheel. A sequel Perfectly Prudence aired on January 8, 2011.  Plot summary  Prudence Macintyre (Jane Seymour) is the host of the fictitious hit \\"do-it-yourself\\" television show Dear Prudence giving out 'Pru Pointers' to her viewers. The film opens with Pru recording a point on how to water plants whilst away, by filling a bucket of water, tying one end of some cotton twine around a brick and the other end is pushed into the plant pot. When the brick is left in the bucket, the water will work its way up the cotton into the plant pot. As she yawns through the segment, she is interrupted by her boss who insists that she take the company jet and fly to his lodge in Wyoming for the week to rest. Arriving at the airport, Pru is met by Ruth (Tantoo Cardinal) who shows her around the location and to sacred ground. The lodge is built on the last remnant of Indian land preserved by the Andrews family. Whilst Ruth is discussing plans to commemorate Bart Andrews' death to celebrate all his previous work, Bart's son Jean Phillipe Andrews arrives with his land trust lawyer Doug Craig. She gets involved in a murder investigation with her assistant Nigel. Along the way she provides helpful household tips and tricks that irk the lead investigating officer (Jamey Sheridan). But her forensic-type skills help solve the case.

Although any combination of three drugs can be used, studies have shown that alcohol is commonly used with another substance. This is supported by one study on polysubstance use that separated participants who used multiple substances into groups based on their preferred drug. The results of a long-term or longitudinal study on substance use led the researchers to observe that excessively using or relying on one drug increased the probability of excessively using or relying on another drug. Common combinations The three substances were cocaine, alcohol, and heroin, which implies that those three are very popular. Other studies have found that opiates, cannabis, amphetamines, hallucinogens, inhalants and benzodiazepines are often used in combination as well. Presentation Associated cognitive impairments Cognition refers to what happens in the mind, such as mental functions like \\"perception, attention, memory, language, problem solving, reasoning, and decision making.\\" Although many studies have looked at cognitive impairments of individuals who are dependent on one drug, there are few researchers who have tried to determine the problems with cognitive functioning that are caused by dependence on multiple substances. Therefore, what is known about the effects of polysubstance dependence on mental abilities is based on the results of a few studies. thumb =Learning ability= The effect of polysubstance dependence on learning ability is one area of interest to researchers. A study involving 63 polysubstance dependent women and 46 controls (participants who were not using drugs) used the Benton Visual Retention Test (BVRT) and the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT) to look at visual memory and verbal ability. This study showed that in polysubstance dependent women, verbal learning ability was significantly decreased, though visual memory was not affected. In addition, alcohol and cocaine use led to more severe issues with verbal learning, recall, and recognition. =Memory, reasoning and decision making= Sometimes studies about specific groups in the general population can be informative. One study decided to test the cognitive abilities of participants in rave parties who used multiple substances. To do this, they compared 25 rave party attenders with 27 control participants who were not using drugs. The results of this study indicated that in general, the rave attender group did not perform as well on tasks that tested speed of information processing, working memory, knowledge of similarities between words, ability to attend to a task with interference in the background, and decision making. Certain drugs were associated with particular mental functions, but the researchers suggested that the impairments for working memory and reasoning were caused by the misuse of multiple substances. Another study that tried to find differences between the effects of particular drugs focused on polysubstance users who were seeking treatment for addictions to cannabis, cocaine, and heroin. They studied a group of polysubstance users and a group that was not dependent on any drugs. Because alcohol was a common co-substance for nearly all of the polysubstance user group, it was difficult to tell exactly which drugs were affecting certain cognitive functions. The researchers found that the difference in the two groups' performance levels on executive function, or higher-level cognitive processing tasks were consistently showing that the polysubstance group scored lower than the control group. In general, this meant that multiple substances negatively affected the polysubstance group's cognitive functioning. More specifically, the researchers found that the amount of cannabis and cocaine affected the verbal part of working memory, the reasoning task, and decision making, while cocaine and heroin had a similar negative effect on visual and spatial tasks, but cannabis particularly affected visual and spatial working memory. These results suggest that the combined use of cannabis, cocaine, and heroin impair more cognitive functions more severely than if used separately. Alcohol's negative effects on learning, spatial abilities and memory has been shown in many studies. This raises a question: does using alcohol in combination with other substances impair cognitive functioning even more? One study decided to try to determine if polysubstance users who also abused alcohol would display poorer performance on a verbal learning and memory test in comparison to those who abused alcohol specifically. The California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT) was used due to its ability to \\"quantify small changes in verbal learning and memory\\" by evaluating errors made during the test and the strategies used to make those errors. The results of this study showed that the group of polysubstance and alcohol abusers did perform poorly on the CVLT recall and recognition tests in comparison to the group of alcohol abusers only, which implies that alcohol and drug abuse combined impaired the memory and learning of the group of polysubstance and alcohol abusers in a different way than the effects of alcohol alone can explain. =Length of abstinence matter= Does abstinence for long periods of time help polysubstance dependent individuals to recover cognitive functioning? To examine this question, a group of researchers tested 207 polysubstance dependent men, of whom 73.4% were dependent on three or more drugs. The researchers were interested in 6 areas of cognitive functioning, which included visual memory, verbal memory, knowledge of words, abstract reasoning, inhibition (interference), and attention. The study used the Benton Visual Retention Test (BVRT) for testing visual memory, the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT) for verbal memory, the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale vocabulary portion for knowledge of words, the Booklet Category Test for abstract reasoning, the Stroop Neuropsychological Screening task for inhibition, and the Trail Making Test for attention. The results showed that neuropsychological ability did not improve with increases in the length of time abstinent. This suggests that polysubstance dependence leads to serious impairment which cannot be recovered much over the span of a year. Causes Biological thumb There is data to support that some genes contribute to substance dependence. Some studies have focused on finding genes that predispose the person to be dependent on marijuana, cocaine, or heroin by studying genes that control a person's dopamine and opioid receptors, but no conclusive findings were reported. Other researchers found a connection between dopamine receptor genes and dependency on a substance. A potential problem with this study was that alcohol is commonly used with another substance, so the results of the study may not have been caused by dependency on a single substance. This means that multiple substances may have been contributing to the results, but the researchers suggested that further research should be done. However, there are studies that have found evidence of the influence of genes on vulnerability to substance dependence. These studies often use genotype, or the genetic information found on a person's chromosomes, and phenotype, which consists of the visible features of a person, to look at genetic patterns. One study examined the phenotype and genotype of 1,858 participants from 893 families to look at differences in three nicotinic acetylcholine receptor genes found within these individuals. The experimenters found significant connections between receptor genes for nicotine and polysubstance dependence, which indicated that differences in these genes can create the risk of being dependent on multiple substances. Psychological A 1989 study conducted by Khantzian and Treece found that nearly 60% of their opioid-dependent sample met criteria for an Axis II diagnosis. In the same study, 93% of the sample had a comorbid disorder, implying that the comorbid disorder plays some role in the addiction. It has also been shown that depression and polysubstance dependence are often both present at the same time. If a person is genetically predisposed to be depressed then they are at a higher risk of having polysubstance dependence. Possibly the most widely accepted cause of addictions is the self-medication hypothesis, that views drug addiction as a form of coping with stress through negative reinforcement, by temporarily alleviating awareness of or concerns over the stressor. Substance users learn that the effects of each type of drug work to relieve or better painful states. They use drugs as a form of self- medication to deal with difficulties of self-esteem, relationships, and self- care. Individuals with substance use disorders often are overwhelmed with emotions and painful situations and turn to substances as a coping method. Sociocultural The sociocultural causes are areas in a person‚Äôs life that might have influenced their decision to start and continue using multiple substances. Sociocultural causes can be divided into social causes and cultural causes. *Social Causes: Some studies have shown that adolescents have one of the highest rates of polysubstance dependence. According to one study this population, ages 12‚Äì25, represents about half of the nation's illicit drug users. Of these illicit drug users, half of them have started using substances by the end of 12th grade. This could be attributed to social expectations of peers, peer pressure to fit it, or a way of numbing their emotions. Some of these young kids start trying different drugs initially to fit in, but then after a while they start to develop a tolerance for these substances and experience withdrawal if they don‚Äôt have enough substances in their system and eventually become dependent on having the effects of substance dependence. With tolerance comes the craving for additional drugs to get high, this constant need for that feeling is polysubstance dependence. :In the older generations, polysubstance dependence had been linked to additional considerations such as personality disorder, homelessness, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder and so on. Medical care being so expensive and difficult to get long term has been linked to polysubstance dependence. Those who need psychological help sometimes use multiple substances as a type of self medication to help manage their mental illnesses. Comorbidity of mental disorders For most of these disorders, in relation to polysubstance dependence, there is a vicious cycle that those with a dependence go through. First, Ingesting the drug creates a need for more, which creates a dopamine surge, which then creates pleasure. As the dopamine subsides, the pleasure adds to the emotional and physical pain and triggers stress transmitters, which in turn creates a craving, which must then be medicated, and thus the cycle begins again. However, the next time they use, more of the drug will need to be used to get to the same degree of intoxication . Depression Scientists have hypothesized that the use of a drug either causes a mood disorder such as depression or at least attributes to a pre-existing one. Additionally, the substances that sufferers of depression use can be a misguided method of self-medication in order to manage their depression. This is the classic chicken or egg hypothesis, does the pre-existing condition cause dependence or does dependence cause the condition? The underlying mental illness needs to be identified and treated in conjunction with treating the polysubstance dependence in order to increase the success rate of treatment and decrease the probability of relapse. One specific study focused on alcohol and depression, because they are so commonly inter-related. Researchers have discovered that depression continues for several weeks after a patient had been rehabilitated and those who relapsed developed depression again. This means that the onset of depression happens after alcohol dependence occurs, which means that alcohol is a major contributor to depression. Eating disorders One study showed that patients who are recovering from an addiction, who have had an eating disorder in the past, often use food to try to replace the substance that they are no longer getting. Or they obsess over controlling their weight and appearance. Some rehabilitation centers have licensed nutritionists to help patients develop healthy eating habits to help them cope while recovering from their addictions. It is important that those who have a former eating disorder be taught how to eat healthfully, so they don‚Äôt continuously switch from one addiction back to another. Diagnosis According to the DSM-IV, a diagnosis of polysubstance dependence must include a person who has used at least three different substances (not including caffeine or nicotine) indiscriminately, but does not have a preference to any specific one. In addition they must show a minimum of three of the following symptoms listed below, all within the past twelve months. There is a distinct difference between a person having three separate dependence issues and having Polysubstance dependence the main difference is polysubstance dependence means that they are not specifically addicted to one particular substance. This is often confused with multiple specific dependences present at the same time. To elaborate, if a person is addicted to three separate substance such as cocaine, methamphetamines and alcohol and is dependent on all three then they would be diagnosed with three separate dependence disorders existing together (cocaine dependence, methamphetamine dependence and alcohol dependence,) not polysubstance dependence. In addition to using three different substances without a preference to one, there has to be a certain level of dysfunction in a person‚Äôs life to qualify for a diagnosis of polysubstance dependence. One of the bigger challenges that often occurs when trying to diagnose is the fact that people don't always report what they are taking because they are afraid of getting into legal trouble. When coding polysubstance Dependence in a DSM- IV it would be a multiaxial diagnosis 304.80- Polysubstance Dependence\\", next to the classification, it is accompanied by a list of other types of Substance dependence (e.g. \\"305.00 Alcohol Abuse\\" or \\"305.60 Cocaine Abuse\\"). The DSM-IV requires at least three of the following symptoms present during a 12-month period for a diagnoses of polysubstance dependence. * Tolerance: Use of increasingly high amounts of a substance or they find the same amount less and less effective ( the amount has to be at least 50% more of the original amount needed.) * Withdrawal: Either withdrawal symptoms when drug stops being used or the drug is used to prevent withdrawal symptoms. * Loss of control: Repeated use of more drugs than planned or use of the drugs over longer periods of time than planned. * Inability to stop using: Either unsuccessfully attempted to cut down or stop using the drugs or a persistent desire to stop using. * Time: Spending a lot of time studying drugs, obtaining drugs, using drugs, being under the influence of drugs, and recovering from the effects of drugs. * Interference with activities: Give up or reduce the amount of time involved in recreational activities, social activities, and/or occupational activities because of the use of drugs. * Harm to self: Continuous use of drugs despite having a physical or psychological problem caused by or made worse by the use of drugs. DSM-5 eliminated polysubstance disorder; there the drugs must be specified, among other related changes. Treatment Treatment for polysubstance dependence has many critical aspects. Drug rehabilitation is a lengthy and difficult process. Treatment must be individualized and last a sufficient amount of time to ensure the patient has kicked the addictions and to ensure the prevention of relapse. The most common forms of treatment for polysubstance dependence include: inpatient and outpatient treatment centers, counseling and behavioral treatments, and medications. It is important that treatments be carried on throughout the patient‚Äôs life in order to prevent relapse. It is a good idea that recovering addicts continue to attend social support groups or meet with counselors to ensure they do not relapse. Inpatient treatment center Inpatient treatment centers are treatment centers where addicts move to the facility while they are undergoing treatment. Inpatient treatment centers offer a safe environment where patients will not be exposed to potentially harmful situations during their treatments as they would on the outside. Inpatient treatment centers see much higher success rates than the alternative outpatient treatments. Inpatients usually undergo the process of detoxification. Detox involves the removal (usually medically) of all drug substances from the body. Once detox is complete, the withdrawal symptoms kick in (2‚Äì3 days later). These symptoms include, but are not limited to: nausea, depression, anxiety, panic attacks, restlessness, and drug cravings. During their stay in the treatment facility, patients are learning to manage and identify their drug addictions and to find alternate ways to cope with whatever is the cause of their addiction. \\"What is Drug rehab?\\" drugrehab.org Outpatient treatments Outpatient treatments include many of the same activities offered in an inpatient treatment facility, but the patient is not protected by the secure and safe environment of an inpatient treatment center. For this reason, they are significantly less effective. The patient usually continues to hold a job and goes to treatment nightly. Twelve-step programs Both in-patient and out-patient treatments can offer introductions to 12-step programs. Suggested 12-step programs are Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics Anonymous (NA). They offer regular meetings where members can discuss their experiences in a non-judgmental and supportive place. Cognitive behavioral therapy Also offered to patients are one-on-one counseling sessions and cognitive behavioral therapy(CBT). When looked at through a cognitive-behavioral perspective, addictions are the result of learned behaviors developed through positive experiences. In other words, when an individual uses a drug and receives desired results (happiness, reduced stress, etc.) it may become the preferred way of attaining those results, leading to addictions. The goal of CBT is to identify the needs that the addictions are being used to meet and to develop skills and alternative ways of meeting those needs. The therapist will work with the patient to educate them on their addictions and give them the skills they need to change their cognition's and behaviors.Addicts will learn to identify and correct problematic behavior. They will be taught how to identify harmful thoughts and drug cravings. CBT is an effective treatment for addictions. Medications Medications can be very helpful in the long term treatment of polysubstance dependence. Medications are a useful aid in helping to prevent or reducing drug cravings. Another benefit of medications is helping to preventing relapse. Since drug addictions effect brain functioning, medications assist in returning to normal brain functioning. Polysubstance abusers require medications for each substance they are addicted to, as the current medications do not treat all addictions simultaneously. Medications are a useful aid in treatments, but are not effective when they are the sole treatment method. Medications that aid in treating addictions * Methadone treatment for heroin addiction. * 'Naltrexone: Reduces opiates and alcohol cravings. * Disulfiram: induces intense nausea after drinking alcohol. * Acamprosate:normalizes brain chemistry disrupted by alcohol withdrawal and aids alcohol abstinence. * Buprenorphine/naloxone: The two drugs together reduce cravings and block the pleasure from opiates. Epidemiology There are not very many studies that have examined how often polysubstance dependence occurs or how many people are dependent on multiple substances. However, according to a study that analyzed the results from the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions, approximately 215.5 out of a total of 43,093 individuals in the United States (0.5%) met the requirements for polysubstance abuse/dependence. Another study suggested that the number of new cases of polysubstance dependence has been going up. This idea was supported by a study that took place in Munich, Germany. A group of researchers chose to look at responses to a survey using the M-Composite International Diagnostic Interview (M-CIDI). The M-CIDI is a version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). The researchers collected data from 3,021 participants, all between the ages of 14 and 24, to estimate the prevalence, or total number of cases, of drug abuse/dependence and of polysubstance abuse/dependence. The results of this study indicated that of the 17.3% who said that they regularly used drugs, 40% said that they used more than one substance, but 3.9% specifically reported using three or more substances, indicating that there is a lot of overlap in the use of different substances. The researchers compared their results to earlier German studies and found that substance dependence seems to be increasing, at least in Germany. Gender differences Women and men differ in various ways when it comes to addictions. Research has shown that women are more likely to be polysubstant dependent. It has been noted that a larger percentage of women abuse licit (legal) drugs such as tranquilizers, sedatives, and stimulants. On the other hand, men are more likely to abuse illicit (illegal) drugs such as cocaine, meth, and other street drugs. Research suggests that women addicts more frequently have a family history of drug abuse. When asked to describe their onset of addictions, women more frequently describe their addiction as sudden where as men describe them as gradual. Females have a higher percentage of fatty tissues and a lower percentage of body water than men. Therefore, women have slower absorption rates of drug substances. This means these substances are at a higher concentration in a women‚Äôs bloodstream. Women addicts are known to be at greater risk for fatty liver disease, hypertension, anemia, and other disorders.

As a result, the NCAA voided Howard‚Äôs 1971 NCAA championship. Howard sued the NCAA, but the United States Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit ruled in favor of the NCAA. In February 1973, the Dallas Tornado selected Aqui in the first round (sixth overall) of the North American Soccer League draft. The Tornado released him in the pre-season and he joined the Baltimore Bays of the American Soccer League. In 1974, Aqui signed with the Baltimore Comets of the North American Soccer League. In 1976, the Comets moved to San Diego where the team was renamed the San Diego Jaws.

Illegal entry is the act of foreign nationals arriving in or crossing the borders into a country in violation of its immigration law. Human smuggling is the practice of aiding people in crossing international borders for financial gain, often in large groups. Human smuggling is associated with human trafficking. A human smuggler will facilitate illegal entry into a country for a fee, but on arrival at their destination, the smuggled person is usually free. Trafficking involves physical force, fraud, or deception to obtain and transport people, usually for enslavement or forced prostitution. By country  India  Presently, India is constructing a fence along the border to restrict illegal traffic from Bangladesh. The Indo-Bangladeshi barrier is long. The stated aim of the fence is to stop infiltration of terrorists, prevent smuggling, and to bring a close to illegal immigration from Bangladesh.  Australia  In Australia, mandatory immigration detention was revived in 1992 for all foreigners who arrive in Australia without a visa. That only \\"border applicants\\" are subject to detention has sparked criticism, as it is claimed to unfairly discriminate against certain migrants. Suspected Irregular Entry Vessel was the name used by the Australian Defence Force or Australian Coastwatch for maritime vessels which were suspected to be attempting to reach Australia without authorisation. In practice, these boats were often carrying asylum seekers who had departed from Indonesia on the final leg of a journey which started in countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan after paying people smugglers. Palestine During 1933‚Äì1948, the British government limited Jewish immigration to Palestine with quotas, and following the rise of Nazism to power in Germany, illegal immigration to Palestine commenced. The illegal immigration was known as Aliyah Bet (\\"secondary immigration\\"), or Ha'apalah, and was organized by the Mossad Le'aliyah Bet, as well as by the Irgun. Immigration was done mainly by sea, and to a lesser extent overland through Iraq and Syria. Beginning in 1939 Jewish immigration was further restricted, limiting it to 75,000 individuals for a period of five years after which immigration was to end completely. During World War II and the years that followed until independence, Aliyah Bet became the main form of Jewish immigration to Palestine. Despite British efforts to curb the illegal immigration, during the 14 years of its operation, 110,000 Jews immigrated to Palestine. Turkey Turkey, which is a transit point for unauthorized migrants trying to reach Europe, has been accused of being unable to secure its borders with Greece. Since 1996, 40 unauthorized migrants have been killed by mines, after entering Greek territory in Evros. In 2001, about 800 illegal immigrants were rescued by the Greek coastguards after a fire broke out on board the Turkish-flagged Brelner, believed to have set sail from the Turkish port of ƒ∞zmir, probably en route to Italy. Once in July 2004 and a second time in May 2006, Hellenic Coast Guard ships were caught on film cruising as near as a few hundred meters off the Turkish coast and abandoning clandestines to the sea. This practice resulted in the drowning of six people between Chios and Karaburun on 26 September 2006 while three others disappeared and 31 were saved by Turkish gendarmes and fishermen. Three of the drowned were Tunisians, one was Algerian, one Palestinian and the other Iraqi. The three disappeared were also Tunisians. As a result of bilateral negotiations, a readmission agreement was signed between Turkey and Greece in November 2001 and went into effect in April 2002. For third country nationals, this protocol gives the parties 14 days to inform each other of the number of persons to be returned after the date of illegal entry. For nationals of the two countries the authorities can make use of simplified procedures. But the strict application of the agreement is reported to have retrograded as of 2003. China People's Republic of China is building a security barrier along its border with North Korea to prevent defectors or refugees from North Korea from entering the country illegally. On May 13, 2004, the People's Republic of China sentenced Yang Jianli, a Chinese dissident with U.S. residency, to five years in prison for espionage and illegal entry. =Hong Kong= The illegal entry of Vietnamese refugees was a concern for the Hong Kong government for 25 years. The issue was first resolved in 2000. Between 1975 and 1999, 143,700 Vietnamese refugees were resettled in other countries and more than 67,000 Vietnamese migrants were repatriated. Iran On 23 March 2007, 15 British Royal Navy personnel, from HMS Cornwall, were surrounded by the Navy of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards and were subsequently detained off the Iraq-Iran coast. Iran's director general for Western European affairs, Ibrahim Rahimpour, said that the British boats had made \\"illegal entry\\" into Iranian territorial waters and that the personnel \\"were arrested by border guards for investigation and questioning\\". On 24 March, the Iranian Fars News Agency said the navigational equipment seized on the British boats shows the sailors were aware that they were operating in Iranian waters. On the same day, General Ali Reza Afshar, a top military official, said the sailors had confessed to illegal entry into Iran's waters. Egypt On January 25, 2008, Egyptian security forces blocked almost all illegal entry points along the border with Gaza to try to stem the flow of Palestinians wanting to leave. Egyptian forces in riot gear erected barbed wire and chain-link fences along the border to prevent more Palestinians from crossing. Thailand On June 5, 2006, 231 Hmong refugees fleeing Laos were detained by police in Amphoe Khao Kho, Phetchabun Province for illegal entry into Thailand. The Hmong were seeking asylum at the province's Ban Huay Nam Khao, where about 6,500 ethnic Hmong are being sheltered, but the Thai military refused to allow them to stay. Most of the Hmong claim they fought against the communists in the Secret War.  Malaysia  Most unlawful migrants to Malaysia are from nearby Southeast Asian countries such as Indonesia particularly on Indonesia‚ÄìMalaysia border via maritime boundary of Strait of Malacca and land border on the island of Borneo. The land border on Malaysia‚ÄìThailand mostly used by Bangladeshi & Rakhine people of Myanmar. The Malaysia‚ÄìPhilippines border normally used by Mindanao people via Celebes Sea.  United States  A warning sign at the international boundary between the United States and Canada in Point Roberts, Washington US Border Patrol agents review documents of individuals suspected of attempted illegal entry in 2019 There are an estimated half a million illegal entries into the United States each year, according to research conducted by the Government Accountability Office in 2006. In 2008, the Pew Hispanic Center estimated there were six to seven million people living in the United States after having evaded the Immigration Inspectors or Border Patrol. The first offense is a misdemeanor according to the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which prohibits non-nationals from entering or attempting to enter the United States at any time or place which has not been designated by an immigration officer, and also prohibits non-nationals from eluding inspection by immigration officers. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection is responsible for apprehending individuals attempting to enter the United States illegally. The United States Border Patrol is its mobile uniformed law enforcement arm, responsible for deterrence, detection and apprehension of those who enter the United States without authorization from the government or outside the designated ports of entry. The unfenced, rural mountainous and desert border between Arizona and Mexico has become a major entrance area for unlawful migration to the United States, due in part to the increased difficulty of crossing illegally into California. Each year there are several hundred migrant deaths along the Mexico-U.S. border.United States Government Accounting Office. GAO-06-770, August 2006. Often, migrants employ people smugglers (known as \\"coyotes\\") who promise a safe passage into the United States and are paid up to 3 to 6 thousand for passages that include long walking distances or 7 to 14 thousand for an easier travel per person they assist in crossing the border. The difficulty and expense of the journey has prompted many migrant workers to stay in the United States longer or indefinitely. According to the U.S. Border Patrol, there were 1,954 migrant deaths along the Mexico-U.S. border between 1998 and 2004. On June 6, 1993, 283 Chinese migrants attempted illegal entry into the United States via a sea vessel; ten of them arrived dead. Reference: Bill Ward  United Kingdom  A recent study into irregular immigration to the United Kingdom states that \\"most irregular migrants have committed administrative offences rather than a serious crime\\".Irregular migration in the UK: An ippr factfile Institute for Public Policy Research, April 2006, p. 5. In 2004, illegal entry action was initiated against 36,550 migrants; it was estimated that more migrants overstay their visa than enter clandestinely, hence considered unlikely that there are large numbers of people crossing UK borders without permission. Many of the routes for clandestine entry are very dangerous. There were 72 documented deaths that are thought to have occurred while entering UK between 1993 and 2002. The most common cause of death while entering the UK (61 of the deaths recorded) was suffocation in a lorry while being smuggled into the UK by ferry; Others drowned in the English Channel, froze to death as stowaways on an aeroplane and were crushed by trains in the Channel Tunnel. Germany Over 28,000 people entered Germany by land and 10,300 entering from Austria. Some 9,270 people also arrived irregularly at airports and more than 1,120 people at sea ports. Most of the migrants were from Afghanistan, Nigeria, Iraq, Syria and Turkey. This brought the number to 38,000 irregular migrants arrested by the Federal Police in Germany.

Jurriaanse (JUR) Collection  Kept separately in its own room, is the Jurriaanse (JUR) Collection. Dr Aardt Jurriaanse, a Dutchman, studied medicine in the Netherlands and came to South Africa during the Anglo Boer War with a medical corps in aid of the Boers. He stayed on in South Africa after the war and worked as a general practitioner in the Ermelo, Mpumalanga district of the old Transvaal where he also farmed until the end of his life. His collection of books covers the classics in literature and medicine.  UP Publications (TUK)  A collection of publications by the staff, research units/student bodies or any association / organization of the University of Pretoria, also forms part of Special Collections. All publications that deal with the University of Pretoria or publications that were published with financial assistance from the University of Pretoria, are also included in this collection. Masters and Doctoral research outputs of University of Pretoria students are regarded and preserved, as special UP Publications. This collection contains a copy of each and every dissertation/thesis by Masters and Doctoral students enrolled at all the faculties at the University of Pretoria. In 2004 it became the policy of the University of Pretoria that a student must submit a bound paper copy as well as two electronic copies of the approved dissertation/thesis. Since then the electronic copy is regarded as the preservation copy.  Netherlands Cultural History Library (KHI & KHN) Collection  The collection is the most extensive Dutch collection in the Southern Hemisphere and consists of approximately 40 000 books and 40 000 journals covering all disciplines. Most of the old and rare books of this collection published before 1900 have been catalogued on UPExplore. and separated from the main collection. These books are identified with the prefix KHIN. Some of the modern works have been integrated with the general collection of the Academic Information Service, while the rest are housed in the Old Merensky Library. They are accessible only via a card catalogue, but are in the process of being catalogued on UPExplore.  The R.M. Titlestad Collection of Norwegian Literature  Professor P.J.H. Titlestad, retired Head of the Department of English, donated this collection in 2007. The collection, a substantial part of which includes Norwegian verse and the works of Henrik Ibsen and Knut Hamsun, was begun by the donator's father, Prof R.M. Titlestad (1899‚Äì1983) Head of the English Department at UP from 1943‚Äì1960, and later supplemented by the books of his friend, Leif Egeland.  Reserves (RES)  Interesting items in this collection are first edition facsimiles of the Gutenberg Bible and Leonardo da Vinci's Notebooks . This collection was home to the works that were X-rated during the Apartheid years, i.e. books censored by the government, because they were considered subversive or pornographic. Currently it consists of \\"high risk\\" books which are placed in the collection at the request of information specialists.  Digital Collections  These collections can be viewed on Upspace, the digital research repository of the University of Pretoria.

The 3,300 acre former plantation is located approximately north of the independent city of Richmond and east of the incorporated town of Ashland. The property was listed in the National Register of Historic Places and the Virginia Landmarks Register in 1974. History The Hickory Hill property was long an appendage to Shirley Plantation in Charles City County, much of it having come into possession of Robert Carter by a deed dated March 2, 1734. Carter gave the estate as a wedding gift to his daughter Anne Butler Carter (1797-1868) and her husband, William Fanning {W. F.) Wickham (1793-1880), a lawyer and planter. The dowry included all the slaves on the plantation. From September 1828 until January 29, 1864 Wickham kept a close record of the names, dates of death, and, often, kinships, of the slave population on the estate. The Wickham family continued to reside on the estate until selling the property in the early 2000s. At its height, the estate consisted of of land, and by 1860 was one of the largest plantations in Virginia, and had over 200 slaves working on it, only one of two such estates in Hanover County with that number of slaves, and one of nine in the entrie state. Hickory Hill produced wheat (its major crop), corn, oats, and a small amount of tobacco. Fruits and vegetables were also grown, but probably for consumption on the plantation. Unlike other Hanover County plantations, which sold locally, Hickory Hill sold its produce in Richmond where it brought a higher price. It had its own stop, Wickham Station, just below the manor house on the former Virginia Central Railroad. Included on the grounds of the estate is the Hickory Hill Slave and African American Cemetery on Providence Church Road. The cemetery is enclosed by a white vinyl post-and- board fence which was constructed some time after 2010. Some burials may have taken place outside of the fenced-in area. Not all burial sites have gravestones, some are mere depression in the ground. A survey found about 149 interment sites, with the strong possibility of there being more. The cemetery was in use from c.1820 to c.1938.Dunkel, D.

Karma Gon (karma dgon, also Karma Dansa, karma gdan sa; Chinese, Gama Si), is located on the eastern bank of the Dzachu River in Chamdo, eastern Tibet.Dorje (2009), pp. 481, 938. Karma Dansa was the cradle of the karma kagyupas. When established the Karmapa had gathered 1000 monks around him here. Karma Gon was named as Karma Dansa as an administrative unit and the Chinese Ming Court enlarged the monastery‚Äôs jurisdiction by adding the Mekong‚Äôs middle and upper reaches. It was then also called Gama Dansa Si in Chinese. Other sources, claim it was founded in 1184 by Ch√∂dzin Gemphel Yang & Ma 1992 and Gruschke 2004, S. 45.(chos ‚Äòdzin dge ‚Äòphel), the late 1st Karmapa D√ºsum Khyenpa (dus gsum mkhyen pa). History History records that Deshin Shekpa, 5th Karmapa Lama gave the title of Situ to his disciple, Chokyi Gyaltsen (1377‚Äì1448), and appointed him as the Master of Studies at Karma Gon. Earlier than this incarnation, there were two others namely, Yehse Nyingpo and Ringowa Ratnabhadra. After Situ Chokyi Gyaltsen, the second Situ in the list was Tashi Namgyal (1450‚Äì97) who was ordained Thongwa D√∂nden, 6th Karmapa Lama and put in charge of the Karma Gon. The third Situ was Tashi Paljor (1498‚Äì1541) followed by the Situ Chokyi Gocha (1542‚Äì85); both were involved in developing the Karma Gon Monastery. They are credited with creating a fine library, apart from embellishing the monastery walls with rare paintings and carvings. Most of these were reportedly destroyed during the Cultural Revolution by the communist regime, except for a few old buildings that still remain. The fourth Situpa was Situ Tashi Paljor who identified Miko Dorjee as the 8th Karmapa and who also became his teacher. The Fifth Situpa Chokyi Gyaltsen was honoured with a red Crown by Wangchuk Dorje, 9th Karmapa Lama for his spiritual attainments. The Tai Situpas with their roots in the Kham region of eastern Tibet always played a significant role in identifying the Karmapa Incarnations. The sixth Tai Situpa was Mipal Chogyal Rabten (1658‚Äì82) known for his miracle performing achievements, who was followed by Mawe Nyima (son of King Lin) who had a premature death. The eighth Tai Situpa, Chokyi Jungne (1700‚Äì74) was the most distinguished scholar who went to establish Palpung Monastery in 1717 after which the importance of the Karma Gon monastery has waned.Terhune, p.261,Appendix 2 -Karmapa Incarnations Structure The hundred-pillar Assembly Hall was once one of the largest in Tibet, containing 12 chapels and magnificent murals illustrating the deeds of the Buddha and historical scenes relating to the Karma Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism. It used to contain three gilded brass images of the 'Buddhas of the Three Times' in its inner sanctum and there was a large central image of Shakyamuni Buddha on a sandalwood throne which 8th Karmapa personally designed. The surviving buildings show a remarkable synthesis of Tibetan, Naxi (Jang) and Chinese styles which attest to the influence of the monastery as far south as Lithang. There a number of statues and other relics, some of them ancient, and an upstairs room sealed off with a curtain of chain mail where 100 monks study the commentaries of the 8th Karmapa.Dorje (2009), pp. 481‚Äì482. :\\"Adjacent to the great temple, in the Khandro Bumtang meadow, where Karmapas would perform the Black Hat ceremony, there are three ancient stupas, containing the relics of the First Karmapa, the First Situ Rinpoche and Wangchuk Chobar, who was a senior student of the former. Behind these is a chapel containing the gilded stupa of Karma Pakshi (1204‚Äì1339), replete with sacred tooth relics, and a newly build [sic] monastic college which will hold 500 monks ... ruined hermitages are in the crags above the temple, alongside that of the first Karmapa, which is nowadays marked with prayer flags. There are, however, two active retreat centres above the monastery, dedicated respectively to the practices of Chodruk and Dorje Drolo.\\" Dorje (2009), p. 482. In the 13th century, Karma Pakshi, 2nd Karmapa Lama, considered a child prodigy, had become an ordained monk at the age of 22. He had received the complete series of Kargyu teachings and was the dharma protector of Kargyu lineage. He was the 2nd Gyalwa Karmapa. During his visit to this monastery, after noting the poor state of repair of the monastery, he had ensured during his time, complete restoration of the monastery to its original state. Restoration :\\"Chokgyur Lingpa has lived in the Sang Ngak Podrang (Secret Mantra Palace) hermitage of Karma Gon Monastery (the first monastery of the first Karmapa) for several years with his main disciple, Karma Rinchen Dhagye. This hermitage is greatly in need of maintenance. When [Chokling Jigmed Palden] Rinpoche visited Karma Gon in 2005, he accepted the monastery‚Äôs request to help rebuild the Chokgyur Lingpa‚Äôs hermitage.\\" The Government of People's Republic of China and the Tibet Autonomous Region have undertaken an extensive programme and provided funds for the maintenance and restoration of a number of famous monasteries including the Karma-gdan-sa monastery of the Karma Kargyu sect.

In 2011 he helped expose the illegal catching of a shark, an action which caused great controversy. Johnson has tagged Great White Sharks for research purposes.  Personal life  Johnson lives in Mossel Bay, South Africa with his partner Fiona Ayerst and son Finn Johnson where he conducts research as a Scientist in Residence at Oceans Research, while also directing the work of other divisions of the Oceans such as multimedia design company Oceans Interactive and great white shark inspired clothing range Carcharias. He's a distant cousin of American film director Rian Johnson.  Research highlights  Johnson was part of the first South African team to successfully attach a satellite transmitters to a great white shark on 24 July 2001. Johnson has tagged Great White Sharks for research purposes. His major scientific discoveries have been the satellite tracking of Nicole (a 3.6m great white shark) on a return migration from South Africa to Australia and back, and documenting the Great White Shark hunting Cape fur seal at night time, a previously unknown behavior. Between 2001 and 2005 Johnson conducted research on the controversial practice of chumming great white shark for tourism, often called cage diving, where he discovered evidence of conditioning, however he did not link this to increased numbers of attacks on human beings. In January 2008 he led a pilot study to Ponto Do Ora (Mozambique) on the Zambezi shark, also known as the Bull shark. Johnson was also part of the team that tracked the Ironbound White Shark in the waters south of Key Biscayne, near Miami. Ironbound was caught and tagged on October 3 off Lunenburg, Nova Scotia, and has traveled 1,473 miles down the US East Coast since then. Television programs Between 1998 and present Johnson has featured as a marine scientist in numerous documentaries including Naked Science (National Geographic), Earth Investigated (National Geographic), Animal Camera (BBC) and After the Attack (Discovery Channel). Since 2006 he has hosted Shark Tribe with Dave Salmoni (Discovery Channel), Sharkville (National Geographic) and Shark Pit Mystery (National Geographic). In 2008, Ryan was a guest on Good Morning America with Diane Sawyer, The O'Rielly Factor with Bill O'Reilly25, Fox and Friends, Inside Edition and Red Eye w/ Greg Gutfeld. Johnson has appeared locally on South African television in productions such as 50/50, Carte Blanche and the Big Question debate show. In 2012, he joined shark taggers OCEARCH in South Africa as Chief Scientist. The expedition was filmed as a 10 part series called SHARK WRANGLERS for the History Channel.

He is most notable for his work on golf coverage, though he also directed coverage of the Winter Olympics, the United States Open Tennis Championships, college and professional American football, auto racing and the Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing. He died at his Florida home after suffering from lung cancer. Shortly before his death, Chirkinian was elected to the World Golf Hall of Fame; he was inducted posthumously. Early life Chirkinian was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Golf coverage Chirkinian was known as the 'father of televised golf' for the impact he had on golf broadcasting. He came to the attention of CBS after he impressed with his direction of the 1958 PGA Championship. Recruited by the network, who had no one with expertise in the relatively new field of golf broadcasting, he went on to be executive producer of CBS's golf coverage from 1959 until 1996. During his time at CBS, he was nicknamed 'The Ayatollah' for his brusque, uncompromising approach to directing broadcasts. Chirkinian was particularly well regarded for the coverage of the Masters Tournament that he oversaw for four decades, working closely with the authorities at Augusta National to ensure they were satisfied. Chirkinian was responsible for a number of innovations in the filming and presentation of golf. He ensured as many microphones as possible were placed around the golf course to pick up the sounds of the tournament and golfers' conversations, rather than having commentators talk over silent footage. He showed as many golf shots as possible, cutting quickly from player to player to keep up the pace of the broadcast, unafraid of focusing on the game's stars. The use of multiple cameras was introduced during Chirkinian's tenure, including high-angle cameras mounted in trees and on blimps for the first time. Chirkinian said that he was most proud of being the first to display golfers' scores relative to par, rather than cumulatively, making it simpler to work out how they were faring relative to the rest of the field. Most of all, Chirkinian thought it important to allow coverage to focus on golfers and the shots they made, and was critical of recent innovations in golf broadcasting that he saw as distracting and unnecessary. Other media Chirkinian appeared as himself in the Kevin Costner film Tin Cup. Honors and awards Chirkinian won four Emmys and two Peabody Awards during his career. In 2007 he was awarded the Sports Lifetime Achievement Award and inducted into the Sports Broadcasting Hall of Fame. At the time of his death, he was scheduled to be inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame on May 9, 2011. At the induction ceremony, a message Chirkinian videotaped shortly before his death was broadcast to the assembled golfing luminaries.

It also published long-running mythological/magical stories that ran for years. Originally, \\"Chandamama\\" was started in Telugu by B.Nagi Reddy and Chakrapani, noted Telugu Film makers. It was edited by Kodavatiganti Kutumba Rao, a very close friend of Chakrapani and a literary colossus in Telugu Literature, who edited it for 28 years, till his death in August 1980. In 2007, Chandamama was bought by Geodesic, a Mumbai-based software services provider company. They planned to take the then 60 year old magazine into the digital era. However the magazine is currently defunct as Geodesic itself was found defaulting on outstanding loans and was ordered to be wound up by the Mumbai High Court. As of July 2016, the current status of the magazine is unknown - as the parent company Geodesic is under the liquidation process and the Chandamama brand and IP is expected to be sold off in due course. The official website of the magazine was allowed to expire and drop by the magazine owners and the current website is not associated with the Chandamama magazine. The Magazine The main features of Indian Mythology was completely written by Kutumbarao, who also developed the magazine by encouraging young writers in Telugu and adapted them to suit the Telugu written style that he made so popular in Andhra and the Telugu speaking people for decades. Some of the stories and the folklore features were written by Dasari Subrahmanyam, who made serials like Patala Durgam, etc., also very popular. It was revamped in November 2008 and had gone contemporary in terms of language, presentation, artwork, and content. While it continued to carry old favourites like Vikram-Betal and mythological tales, there were several new additions including contemporary stories, adventure serials, sports, technology, news pages, etc. Considering the new trends in children's literature and the emerging importance given to academic study and analysis of the same, Chandamama had striven to keep its editorial policies in line with the times. As the oldest brand in the field, Chandamama had taken up the responsibility of delivering entertaining, sensitive, and educational literature for its young readers. Chandamama was published in 13 languages (including English), and had a readership of about 200,000.Disney set to tell Chandamama stories Unique style of storytelling The magazine started the unique trend of telling a story, almost always bound by a common thread of moral values, with a grandparents' style of storytelling in the most flexible third-person narrative mode, on print. The stories published have been drawn from numerous historical and modern texts in India, as well as from other countries. Mythology, epics, fables, parables and even useful hearsay were spun suitably to feed the impressionable minds so that they seek the right direction in life, even while entertaining them thoroughly. The stories embedded in the never-ending story of King VikramƒÅditya and Vetala (Vampire), an adaptation of an ancient Sanskrit work Baital Pachisi, brought wide repute to this magazine, and were also featured in popular TV serials. In each issue, the Vetala, in order to prevent him fulfill a vow, poses a typical catch-22 question to king VikramƒÅditya, involving a moral dilemma. The wise king answers correctly, and is thus defeated by the Vetala, forcing the king do it all over again and again. History Chandamama Magazine team in 1952 The first edition of Chandamama was released in July, 1947. The founder editor of the magazine was B.Nagi Reddy who later became a leading film producer in South India. Chakrapani, a friend of Nagi Reddy, was the force behind magazine, and his vision, perception and understanding of the target readership brought name and fame to the magazine. Chandamama was first published in Telugu and Tamil (as Ambulimama) in July 1947. Kannada edition first appeared in July 1949 followed by Hindi in August 1949. Marathi (as Chandoba) and Malayalam (as Ambili Ammavan) editions appeared in April 1952 followed by Gujarati in 1954, English in 1955, Oriya (as Jahnamamu) and Sindhi in 1956, Bengali in August 1972, Punjabi in 1975, Assamese in 1976, Sinhala in 1978, Sanskrit in April 1984 and Santali in 2004. The Punjabi, Sindhi and Sinhala editions were published only for a short period. No English editions were published from October 1957 to June 1970. The magazine ceased publication in 1998, owing to labour disputes. However, the magazine relaunched a year later. It was available in 12 Indian languages and English. For many decades, Chandamama's illustrators defined the look of the magazine. They included such names as M.T.V. Acharya, T. Veera Raghavan, who signed his work as Chithra; Vaddadi Papaiah, who signed as Vapa; Kesava Rao who signed as Kesava; M. Gokhale; and K. C. Sivasankaran, alias Sankar, who joined Chandamama in the year 1951, and continues to draw even now in 2011, in an unbroken association of 6 decades! Later artists such as Shakthi Dass; M. K. Basha, who signed as Razi; Gandhi Ayya, aka Gandhi; and P. Mahesh (Mahe), also continued the tradition into current times. Initially, the covers were printed in four- colours, while the illustrations inside used line drawings. Each page of Chandamama had an illustration, although in the strict sense of the term, Chandamama is not a comic book, with the exception of the Chitra-katha column. Ownership The magazine has been in family hands since foundation, and the current publisher, B Viswanatha Reddy, continued the tradition after taking over the affairs of the magazine from his father. In 1999, the company was floated as a public limited organization, with Morgan Stanley taking a sizable stake in the company. The last editor was Prashant Mulekar of Geodesic. In August 2006, it was reported that Disney was set to buy a stake in Chandamama. In 2007, Chandamama was acquired by technology company Geodesic Information Systems As of July 2016, the current status of the magazine is unknown - as the parent company Geodesic is under the liquidation process and the Chandamama brand and IP is expected to be sold off in due course. The official website of the magazine was allowed to expire and drop by the magazine owners and the current website is not associated with the Chandamama magazine.

Taunga is located in the south Vava'u Group in the far north of the country. Mapa Faletau is the second eldest son of the late Hononorable 'Akau'ola (Inoke Fotu Faletau, 1937‚Äì2005) who was appointed the Governor of Vavau in 2002 by His late Majesty King TƒÅufaƒÅhau Tupou IV after a distinguished career in the civil service, which amongst his many governmental posts, he was the Secretary to the Ministry of Fisheries, the High Commissioner to the United Kingdom and the Director of the Commonwealth.Akauola's Background Faletau was educated in the United Kingdom and graduated from high school in Massey, New Zealand. After the death of his father in late 2005, Faletau's official name was changed to 'Akau'ola and he inherited estates in Vava'u which included Taunga and Ngau.Coronation involvement On 2 March 2007, on Taunga and Ngau were leased by 'Akau'ola to the Warwick International Group of Hotels & Resorts for the construction of a 4 to 5 star hotel resort and spa, which was celebrated as a major achievement for the tourist industry in Tonga. A celebratory lunch was hosted by the people of Taunga, providing succulent roast pigs and an enormous array of seafood. It is envisioned that this development will provide for the people's livelihood as well as allow them to utilise their natural agricultural, fishing and sea skills. This is seen as an enormous boost to tourism and will provide for the people of Taunga as well as the people of Vava'u and the Kingdom of Tonga as a whole, economic prosperity. This is the first foreign investment by a major international hotel chain within the kingdom. The building of the actual hotel has yet to be confirmed by the Warwick group.

It was founded in 2003 by noted Chicano author Luis J. Rodriguez, his wife Trini Rodriguez, Angelica Loa, and Victor Mendoza (Victor E) of El Vuh. Tia Chucha's provides arts and music workshops and events to the culturally underserved Northeastern San Fernando Valley. History Tia Chucha's Centro Cultural was founded in 2003 next door to Tia Chucha's Cafe Cultural, a coffee shop and bookstore owned by Chicano writer Luis Rodriguez, his wife Trini, and their brother-in-law Enrique Sanchez in Sylmar, CA since 2001. The Centro's founders were Luis Rodriguez, Angelica Loa Perez and Victor Mendoza. They began offering workshops in writing, painting, music, dance, film, theater, reiki healing, and indigenous studies. A resident Danza Azteca group, Temachtia Quetzalcoatl, was formed, as well as natural healing circles for both men and women. In 2004 the Centro received its 501 (c) 3 tax exempt status. In 2005, the Centro took over operations of Tia Chucha Press and continues to produce poetry books, distributed by Northwestern University Press. Tia Chucha Press was started in 1989 by Luis Rodriguez in Chicago and since 1991 was run by the nonprofit literary arts organization, the Guild Complex, until the Centro made Tia Chucha Press its publishing wing. This complements the CD production project, Dos Manos Records, that the Centro began in 2003. The Centro also sponsors weekly Open Mic nights as well as regular film nights, musical events, original theater, author readings, and art exhibits. Since 2006, it also created the only annual literacy & performing arts festival in the San Fernando Valley called \\"Celebrating Words: Written, Performed & Sung.\\" And we sponsor an arts-based youth empowerment project called \\"Young Warriors,\\" started by teen leaders Mayra Zaragoza and Brian Dessaint. In January 2007, both the Centro and Tia Chucha's Cafe were forced out of their facility to make way for a high-end laundromat. Given the state of the real estate market at the time, the Centro had to move into a much smaller facility in nearby Lake View Terrace, and the Cafe was closed. In March of that year, the Centro took over the bookstore operation from the Cafe. That summer the Centro established an annual benefit event called \\"Celebrating Community & Culture: Si Se Puede/Yes We Can!\\" at Hollywood's Ford Amphitheatre with such notables as Cheech Marin, John Densmore of the Doors, Charles Wright & the Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band, El Vuh, Xela, Tierra, Upground, Olmeca, Nobuko Miyamoto, and more. The board also expanded to include leaders in the Chicano, African American, Asian, and European American communities. By February 2009, Tia Chucha's Centro Cultural & Bookstore leased another space back in Sylmar at the Sylmar Plaza on Hubbard Boulevard and Gladstone Avenue, down the street from Mission Community College. The Centro is now the only multi-arts cultural space and bookstore in the Northeast San Fernando Valley, with some 450,000 people, mostly Mexican/Central American‚Äîthe second largest Latino community in the United States after East LA (with a sizable African American and growing Asian communities). The Centro has so far been funded by the LA City Department of Cultural Affairs, the LA County Arts Commission, the California Arts Council, the National Endowment for the Arts, the City of San Fernando, the Liberty Hill Foundation, the Panta Rhea Foundation, the Attias Family Foundation, the Middleton Foundation, the Center for Cultural Innovation, Toyota Sales, among others. Individual donors have included Bruce Springsteen, John Densmore of the Doors, Lou Adler, Richard Foos, Adrienne Rich, Tom Hayden, Jack Kornfield, David Sandoval, Jesus Trevino, Denise Chavez and the Border Book Festival, Dave Marsh, and the Luis & Trini Rodriguez Family. Projects Tia Chucha Press Founded in Chicago in 1989 by Luis Rodriguez, Tia Chucha Press has published around 50 poetry collections, anthologies, chapbooks and a CD by a wide range of poets including President Obama Inaugural Poet Elizabeth Alexander, Patricia Smith, Ricardo Sanchez, Terrance Hayes, Tony Fitzpatrick, Lisa Buscani, Diane Glancy, Nick Carbo, Denise Duhamel & Maureen Seaton, Ariel Robello, Virgil Suarez, Kyoko Mori, Patricia Spears Jones, Linda Susan Jackson, Alfred Arteaga, and Richard Vargas. Tia Chucha Poets include Pulitzer and National Book Award nominees, National Poetry Slam Champions, and winners of Whiting, Lannan, National Endowment for the Arts, and Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest fellowships and awards, among others. In 1991, the Press became a project of the Guild Complex, a nonprofit literary arts center in Chicago. Tia Chucha's Centro Cultural took over operations of the Press in 2005. Tia Chucha Press books are distributed by Northwestern University Press and sold at all major independent and chain bookstores as well as online outlets like Amazon.com. Dos Manos Records Founded by Luis Rodriguez in 2002, Dos Manos Records became a project of Tia Chucha's Centro Cultural the following year. Dos Manos has released two CDs: From Earth To Sky: A Collection of Word & Song, a showcase of musicians and spoken word artists from the greater Los Angeles area, and My Name's Not Rodriguez, featuring Rodriguez reading his poetry accompanied by the music of Ernie Perez with the band, Seven Rabbit. Both are available at CD Baby online store. Young Warriors Founded in 2007, Young Warriors is the Centro's ongoing youth empowerment group. Founded by Mayra Zaragoza, Young Warriors utilizes the arts, dialogue, and indigenous healing practices to help troubled young people. Members have taken part in Mosaic Multicultural Foundation's Men's Conferences, Sisters of the Earth Women's Conferences, and the Koures Youth Symposium, among other events. Issues of gangs, drugs, social issues, the arts, and how to live healthy, whole and dignified lives are discussed. A large mural in collaboration with the LA Mural Project, and several young graffiti artists, was painted in 2008 at an elementary school in Sylmar, CA, among other initiatives. Major Events Celebrating Words: Written, Spoken and Sung Begun in 2006, \\"Celebrating Words: Written, Performed & Sung\\" is Tia Chucha's Centro's annual outdoor community festival, held each summer in Sylmar. The only literacy & performing arts festival in Los Angeles' City Council District 7, it features musicians, bands, spoken word artists, theater performers, and dance troupes, as well as an array of local vendors, including Tia Chucha's bookstore. Sponsors have included the LA City Department of Cultural Affairs, Center for Cultural Innovation, Youth Policy Institute, the Mayor's Office, LA County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavksy, Councilpersons Richard Alarcon and Tony Cardenas, California State Senator Alex Padilla, State Assemblyman Felipe Fuentes, among others. Tia Chucha's Celebration of Community and Culture Starting in 2007, Tia Chucha's has produced an annual benefit concert at the John Anson Ford Amphitheatre in Hollywood. The 2007 concert featured John Densmore (of The Doors), Culture Clash, Tierra, Upground, El Vuh, Xela, Luis Rodriguez, Ollin, among others. The 2008 show included Charles Wright & the Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band, Cheech Marin, Nobuko Miyamoto, Opening People's Minds, Olmeca, and Upground. Tia Chucha's resident Azteca Danza group, Temachtia Quetzacoatl, opened for both events. And Latino Comedian Ernie G. served as host.

Its predecessor was known as just Yamaha Libero. Unlike Libero G5, Libero had tachometer and round headlights but lacked fuel gauge. However, Libero G5 came with a sporty headlight and fuel gauge, but lacked the tachometer. A new set of air scoops with a honeycomb grille do dual duty; directing airflow over the engine block and also neatly covering the gap between the engine and the fuel tank. The Libero G5's frame continues to be the tubular dual-cradle type. Yamaha has introduced a compulsive pressure wet sump lubrication system in the 106 cc engine of the Libero G5. This new system works on a constant pressure build-up that is generated by the engine itself thus enables the engine oil/ lubricant to flow evenly over all the engine components, unlike conventional lubrication that works more on gravitational forces thus may not perform as effectively. Yamaha Libero G5 is particularly made for Indian market. However, Yamaha Libero G5 is also popular in Bangladesh. Ground clearance is a comfortable 173 mm, enabling the bike to take on speed-breakers and potholes with greater confidence. In 2007 Yamaha released an upgraded Libero G5 model with alloy wheels and electric starter. Like most Indian motorcycles, this bike comes with a saree guard to increase the safety of female pillion riders. A less sporty-looking version (with same engine) of this bike is marketed as Yamaha Alba. A bigger cousin of this bike with 125 cc engine is Yamaha Gladiator. Some similar/competitor bikes are Hero Honda Splendor, Bajaj Platina, Bajaj CT 100. Production of Yamaha Libero G5 ended in 2010.

It belongs to a class of constructed monoclonal antibodies, bi-specific T-cell engagers (BiTEs), that exert action selectively and direct the human immune system to act against tumor cells. Blinatumomab specifically targets the CD19 antigen present on B cells. In December 2014, it was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration under the accelerated approval program; marketing authorization depended on the outcome of clinical trials that were ongoing at the time of approval. Blinatumomab is given as a continuous IV infusion for 28 consecutive days per cycle. The dose depends on a patient's actual body weight. Patients weighing over 45 kg should receive fixed doses while patients weighing less than 45 kg should receive doses based on their estimated body surface area.  Medical use  Blinatumomab was originally approved to treat Philadelphia chromosome- negative relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia in adults and children. It is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in first or second complete remission with minimal residual disease greater than or equal to 0.1% as well as relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL.  Mechanism of action  Blinatumomab linking a T cell to a malignant B cell. Blinatumomab is a bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE). It enables a patient's T cells to recognize malignant B cells. A molecule of blinatumomab combines two binding sites: a CD3 site for T cells and a CD19 site for the target B cells. CD3 is part of the T cell receptor. The drug works by linking these two cell types and activating the T cell to exert cytotoxic activity on the target cell. CD3 and CD19 are expressed in both pediatric and adult patients, making blinatumomab a potential therapeutic option for both pediatric and adult populations.  History  The drug (originally known as MT103) was developed by a German-American company Micromet, Inc. in cooperation with Lonza; In 2012, Micromet was purchased by Amgen, which furthered the drug's clinical trials. In July 2014, the FDA granted breakthrough therapy status to blinatumomab for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In October 2014, Amgen's Biologics License Application for blinatumomab was granted priority review designation by the FDA, thus establishing a deadline of 19 May 2015, for completion of the FDA review process. On 3 December 2014, the drug was approved for use in the United States to treat Philadelphia chromosome-negative relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia under the FDA's accelerated approval program; marketing authorization depended on the outcome of clinical trials that were ongoing at the time of approval. Cost When blinatumomab was approved, Amgen announced that the price for the drug would be per year, which made it the most expensive cancer drug on the market. Merck's pembrolizumab was priced at per year when it launched (in September 2014). At the time of initial approval, only about 1,000 patients in the US had an indication for blinatumomab. Peter Bach, director of the Center for Health Policy and Outcomes at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, calculated that according to \\"value-based pricing,\\" assuming that the value of a year of life is with a 15% \\"toxicity discount,\\" the market price of blinaumomab should be a month, compared to the market price of a month. A representative of Amgen said, \\"The price of Blincyto reflects the significant clinical, economic and humanistic value of the product to patients and the health-care system. The price also reflects the complexity of developing, manufacturing and reliably supplying innovative biologic medicines.\\"  References   External links  * Breakthrough therapy Immunology Monoclonal antibodies for tumors ","title":"Blinatumomab"},{"id":"18875851","text":"First-seeded John Sadri defeated Tim Wilkison 6‚Äì4, 3‚Äì6, 6‚Äì3, 6‚Äì4 to win the 1980 Benson and Hedges Open singles competition.

The emp√®gue symbolises that the household has contributed to groups of youths gathering funds for celebrations each August. The drawings are made by the youths of a village and are said to date from the early part of the twentieth century when the local male youths would be conscripted into the military. Conscription is no longer practised in France but the tradition continues. The images are of traditional subjects which symbolise the local area. In the Petite Camargue the images frequently involve horses, flamingoes and of course bulls, because of the local version of bullfighting (Course camarguaise). In the version of bullfighting licensed in France the bull is merely decorated with prizes which youths attempt to steal from the long- horned bull. The bull gets to fight another day. Etymology The word is said to have derived from a word in Occitan, empeguar, which means \\"stick\\".Beauvoisin 2008 , translation, accessed 15 August 2008 In Spanish the meaning is to mark with pitch.Spanish-English dictionary, tomisino.org, accessed 15 August 2008 Another suggestion is that it comes from Pegare - the word for paste. The original Emp√®gues were made from a mixture of soot and paste. Detail The images frequently include the abbreviation V.L.J. which stands for Vive La Jeunesse and the year of creation. In this way it is possible to date the development of the designs over many years. The samples included here date back over 40 years to 1964 (when conscription was still practised). Many of these images are from the village of Beauvoisin, but they could have come from any of the villages in Southern France where many of the smallest villages will have their own arena for bullfighting. Groups are formed which fund raise for the season of celebrations of youth called the aubade in August. Groups will form to support their teams, to gather funds and to place their emp√®gues around their area and at their base.La jeunesse de la F√™te Votive 2008 sera sur tous les fronts!, 24 July 2008, translation, Verg√®ze 24Hactive.com, accessed 15 August 2008 The purpose of the images is to record which houses have contributed to the funds for the festival.

In fact these would have been fed from the Soudley Brook, and from the Tilting Mill Pool, now in the grounds of the Dean Heritage Centre. It has also been erroneously claimed that they were dug long before this as fish ponds by the monks of the nearby Flaxley Abbey. However, Atkinson‚Äôs map of 1847 shows only a stream running through the valley where the ponds now lie, and it is nowadays assumed that were created as fish ponds after the land‚Äôs 1836 purchase by mine-owner William Crawshay. In 1899 the ponds, along with the rest of the Abbotswood Estate, were sold by Robert Crawshay, William‚Äôs son, to the Crown, from which point they were leased for fishing to private individuals. It was only in 1906 that the ponds became as they are today, following the work of Arthur Morgan, who had that year acquired the lease of the ponds, and after whom the lowest of the ponds is still locally known as Morgan‚Äôs Pool. Ownership and usage Now in the care of the Forestry Commission, and declared an SSSI by Natural England, the ponds are one of the Forest of Dean‚Äôs most delightful spots, particularly in Spring and in Autumn, and are still used by the anglers of the Soudley Fishing Consortium for the purpose for which they were made.

In his debut in the Second XI Championship, Roy scored 88 from 89 balls against a Hampshire attack which included the South African Test match bowler Nantie Hayward, having come to the crease with Surrey in trouble at 89‚Äì4. Domestic career He made his debut for the Surrey first team in a Twenty20 Cup match against Middlesex on 27 June 2008, and made his List A debut in the Natwest Pro40 League fixture against Yorkshire on 20 July 2008, the day before his 18th birthday. He was used as a substitute fielder for England's test team against South Africa in the final test of the 2008 series at The Oval.Test match substitute In September 2008, Roy was selected for the ECB Elite Player Development squad taking part in a triangular tournament against University Sport South Africa and Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) Universities. Roy was selected for two of his team's four matches. In his first match, against University Sport South Africa, Roy batted at number four but was only able to score a single run. His second match was disrupted by the weather and was declared a no result in the thirteenth over of MCC Universities' innings, which was being bowled by Roy. In 2008, Roy won the Easter Scholarship to spend the 2008/2009 winter at the Darren Lehmann Academy in Adelaide.Place at Darren Lehmann Academy While in Australia, Roy also played club cricket for Port Adelaide Cricket Club, and was part of the team which won the XXXX Gold Grade 20/20 Competition, scoring 20 runs from 12 balls in the final played at the Adelaide Oval. This was the club's first victory in the competition.http://www.surreycricket.com/news/surrey-abroad-jason- roy,6303,NS.html Account of winter 2008/2009 in Australia In April 2009, Roy played in a pre-season match for Surrey against Leeds/Bradford University Centre of Cricketing Excellence. Batting at number five, Roy was dismissed for a duck in Surrey's first innings, but fared better with the ball, taking 2 wickets for 51 runs from five overs. In spite of his promising performances for the Surrey second team the previous year, Roy was unable to win a place in the team at the beginning of the 2009 season. However, on 25 April 2009, he reminded the county selectors of his ability while playing for his club, Reigate Priory, in a 50-over per side match against the Surrey Second XI. He took a catch as Surrey were dismissed for 157, and opened the innings for Reigate Priory, scoring 69 runs from only 51 balls against a bowling attack including former England international James Ormond before being caught behind. This innings was instrumental in Reigate Priory reaching their target of 158 with more than 22 overs to spare. On 23 May 2009, Roy scored 115 off 88 balls in Reigate Priory's victory over Spencer in the Surrey Championship Premier Division. Selected for Surrey to play against Warwickshire in the Under-19s County Championship at Whitgift School on 6 July 2009, Roy scored 129 from 106 balls in a drawn match. Following this impressive performance, Roy made his first appearance of the season in Surrey Second XI's match against Somerset at Millfield School on 14 July, scoring 20 in Surrey's first innings. Roy retained his place in the team for the friendly match against Yorkshire Second XI in Guildford on 11 August. Roy top-scored in Surrey's second innings with 45, although Yorkshire won by an innings with a day to spare. Roy's next appearance for Surrey Second XI was on 18 August against MCC Universities in the Second XI Championship. Playing on familiar territory at Whitgift School, Roy scored 118 from 115 balls in a drawn match. On his return to the one-day team against Kent on 24 August, Roy top scored in Surrey's innings with 55. However, this promising run of form was abruptly ended in the Second XI Championship match against the same opponents which began the following day. Roy recorded a pair, although he took a catch in Kent's second innings. Better performances for his club (including an aggressive 138 from 60 balls against Henley) and the county Second XI in September 2009 led to a recall to the Surrey first team for the NatWest Pro40 League fixture against Leicestershire on 27 September 2009. Roy opened Surrey's innings but scored only 6 runs. However, Surrey won the match by four wickets. This was to be Roy's first and only competitive match for the Surrey first team during the 2009 season. Breakout year 2010 Roy began the 2010 season as a regular in the Surrey Second XI in both Championship (three-day) and Trophy (one-day) cricket. After an unremarkable start to the season, Roy made his first significant contributions to the team in May, scoring centuries in three successive Championship matches, against Essex, Sussex and Durham respectively. While he scored a greater number of runs against Essex (180) and Durham (120), the innings against Sussex was perhaps the most impressive. In Surrey's second innings, Roy batted at number five and came to the crease with the score 42/3 against a bowling attack containing internationals Yasir Arafat and James Kirtley. When Roy was dismissed for 104, the score was 260‚Äì5, setting the platform for Surrey's victory. Roy's century was the top score in Surrey's second innings. Roy maintained his form with a century for Reigate Priory, but as the county schedule turned to a long period without Championship matches, he had no opportunity to continue the run. However, he had caught the attention of Surrey's Cricket Manager, Chris Adams, and was included in Surrey's senior team for the 2010 Friends Provident t20 tournament, making his first appearance against Hampshire on 22 June, scoring 12 runs at a strike rate of 109.09. The following day, Roy made history by scoring an unbeaten century against Kent (101 from only 57 balls), the first century scored by a Surrey batsman in Twenty20 cricket, as Surrey won the game by 38 runs. Roy earned further plaudits with another aggressive innings against Somerset on 2 July, scoring 74 from 50 balls in another Surrey victory. Surrey did not progress beyond the group stages of the 2010 Friends Provident t20, and Roy's personal performances also dipped towards the end of that competition. However, he continued to score heavily for the Second XI and appeared for the Surrey first team in the Clydesdale Bank 40 competition between July and September, the highlight being an innings of 60 from 49 balls against Sussex in a tied match on 4 September. During the match, Roy enjoyed a partnership of 105 runs in 17 overs alongside Surrey's new signing, England international Kevin Pietersen. He made his first-class debut on 24 August 2010 against Leicestershire at Grace Road, and was last man out in Surrey's first innings, scoring 76 runs off 65 balls (including 9 fours and 3 sixes) in Surrey's first innings total of 483. The last four wickets fell for only 7 runs, preventing Roy from scoring a century in his maiden first-class innings. In his second first-class match, Roy scored 69 against Glamorgan on 7 September 2010 and retained his place in the team for Surrey's final County Championship match of the season against Gloucestershire. By the end of the 2010 season, Roy was established as a first team regular in all forms of cricket, and signed a two-year contract with Surrey, which he described as \\"a dream come true\\". 2011 season Although he ended the 2010 season as a first team regular and demonstrated his fitness in prior to the 2011 season (coming top in the Surrey squad's pre-season Bleep Test), Roy was only selected for one pre-season match in the first team, scoring 0 and 4 against Middlesex. Surrey had strengthened their batting resources over the preceding winter, confirming the long term signing of Kevin Pietersen, as well as bringing in new batsmen Zander de Bruyn and Tom Maynard, and Roy began the season in the Second XI. However, Roy was included in the first team for the Clydesdale Bank 40 competition and made an immediate impression, scoring 60 runs in his first match, against Scotland, and 76 against Hampshire. Roy scored another half century in the return fixture against Scotland. He made his first County Championship appearance of the season on 4 May against Leicestershire, and although he was dismissed for 5 in the first innings, he scored an aggressive 76 in the second innings as Surrey set the platform for victory. This innings equalled his highest first-class score at the time. Roy was rested for the Championship match against Essex on 18 May as Surrey included their centrally-contracted international players, Kevin Pietersen and Chris Tremlett, but in the following match, against Glamorgan on 24 May, Roy returned to the first team. After an inauspicious first innings in which he scored only three runs, Roy took his maiden first-class wickets in Glamorgan's second innings, returning bowling figures of 2/29. He then opened Surrey's second innings and scored his maiden first-class century (an unbeaten 106 from 109 balls), guiding Surrey to a comfortable draw. He brought up his hundred with a six struck into the pavilion. On 17 August he scored his first 40 over century, making 101 off 95 balls against Warwickshire at Edgbaston. He followed this up four days later with 131 off 99 balls, helping Surrey defeat Leicestershire at Grace Road. Roy's season ended in fine style, being part of the Surrey side who won the CB40 final at Lord's against Somerset. Although Roy's day wasn't a personal success - being dismissed for a typically aggressive 11 immediately before a rain delay - he could at least be content that, as the second highest run scorer in the competition he had played a significant part in Surrey's progress to that stage.

It is the third film to be released by Moonbeam Entertainment, the family video division of Full Moon Entertainment. Plot Set in modern times, a young five-year-old boy named Johnny McGowan travels to Scotland to live at his grandfather's castle after he loses both his parents in a traffic collision. At the magical wish tree on his grandfather's estate, he conjures up a friend, which is an infant dragon whom he nicknames \\"Yowler\\". They grow up together as 15 years go by. One day after the years go by, documentary filmmaker Bob Armstrong, his daughter Beth, and his pilot Brownie McGee stumble upon Yowler. Eager for fame and money, Bob convinces John to \\"rent\\" Yowler to local corrupt businessperson, Lester McIntyre. John, who is coerced in part by the offer to have the mounting taxes on the castle paid off, allows Lester to take Yowler in. He does so also partly because of his growing interest in Beth. Yowler is miserable and harassed in the new amusement park built for him, and when it becomes clear that McIntyre has duped them in order to exploit the dragon, John and his new friends take action.

Formerly the Town Theater, the building re-opened in 2008 after more than a decade of inactivity and revitalization plans. Built in 1888 as a bank, later mayor Orange Phelps converted the property into a theater in 1911 and in 1925 converted it into a two-story Italianate building with a larger auditorium. Prior to renovation the theater was owned by the city of Hillsboro who purchased it from Act III Theatres. The theater has been temporarily closed since April 2017 in connection with a planned change of ownership. However, that sale fell through, and the theater and restaurant remain closed in mid-2020. In August 2017, its owner told the Hillsboro Tribune that he had found a new buyer, but with no information on when the Venetian might reopen. In May 2020, the identity of a new buyer was revealed, shortly after the purchased was completed. The new owner indicated plans to reopen the building with a new restaurant but to convert the theater space into a ballroom, with the restaurant possibly opening during 2020. History In 1888, banker John W. Shute built a two-story building on East Main Street as the new home for the First National Bank of Hillsboro. The structure featured a fa√ßade in the Italianate style of architecture, external cast iron ornamentation, and a roof line with a bracketed cornice.

In April 2020, the still-vacant building was purchased by John Lee, who told the News-Times in May that he plans to reopen it with a new, upscale restaurant and to remake the theater space into a ballroom. Details The theater at night (after closing time) Located in downtown Hillsboro on Main Street between Second and Third avenues, the theater is one block north of the Hillsboro Central MAX light rail station. Although closed since 2017, the space includes a 370-seat theater, and a restaurant with an upstairs balcony. The balcony sits above Main Street and has roll-up windows. On the exterior are decorative terra cotta urns and red colored roof tiles on Main Street. Designed to encourage late night patronage of the downtown area, the theater is a centerpiece of revitalization efforts of that part of Hillsboro. The current building is a multi-use facility that includes a theater and restaurant. Prior to closing in 2017, the theater exhibited movies, presented live performances, was a live music venue.

Before the arrival of his bride Marina Mniszech, Xenia was sent to the Voskresensky Monastery in Beloozero and forced to take monastic vows, whereupon she was given the name \\"Olga\\". Subsequently, she was transferred to the Assumption Princess Monastery in Vladimir. In 1606 she sojourned to the Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius to attend the reburial of her father; vestments she sewed as a nun are on display at that Lavra.

She also appears in Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k's opera Dimitrij, where the False Dmitry and her relationship to him is portrayed in a more sympathetic light. The opera is only loosely based on the historical account; she is murdered on Marina Mniszech's orders rather than sent to the monastic life.

Clem Rogers' parents were both mixed-blood Cherokees who moved to Indian Territory in 1832, several years before the Trail of Tears. Before the American Civil War, Clem allied with the \\"Treaty Party\\", a Cherokee faction that supported signing the Treaty of New Echota. When the Civil War broke out, Clem enlisted in the Confederate Army, and served under General Stand Watie. After the war, he became active in Cherokee politics, first elected as a judge in the Cooweescoowee District, then served five terms in the Cherokee Senate. He later served as a delegate to the Oklahoma Constitutional Convention. Rogers was the father of entertainer Will Rogers. When Oklahoma became a state in 1907, the former Cherokee Districts were dissolved and replaced by new counties. One of the counties created from the former Cooweescoowee District, Rogers County, Oklahoma, was named in honor of Clement Rogers. Family lineage Clement Vann Rogers's parents, Robert Rogers, Jr., (1815‚Äì1842) and Sallie Vann (1818‚Äì1882), \\"came from Georgia before the main removal of the Cherokees in 1838.\\"Love 1970, p. 389 Sallie Vann was a sister of David Vann, who was related to the Cherokee chief James Vann. Clement Vann, The Chattanooga Sunday Times, Magazine Section, July 26, 1936, by Penelope J. Allen, State Chairman of Genealogical Records, retrieved July 11, 2010 Clem's grandfather was Robert Rogers, Senior, a Scotch-Irish immigrant and trader, who came to the area now known as West Virginia in 1800. Settling there, he married a half-Cherokee woman named Lucy Cordery. Their first son was Robert, Jr., who was born in 1815. This son married Sallie Vann in 1835. Sallie was also from a mixed-blood family, and said to be three-eights Cherokee. Robert Rogers, Sr. was apparently deceased before 1830, when the U.S. Congress passed the Indian Removal Act. By then, Robert Sr.'s widow, her son, Robert, and his two sisters were living in Georgia. After a group of mostly mixed-blood Cherokees signed the Treaty of New Echota in 1830, they decided that migrating west was inevitable and moved in 1832 to a tract of land near the boundary of Arkansas Territory and Indian Territory. After Robert and Sallie built a two- story, five-room house near the community of Westville, in the Goingsnake District of Indian Territory. Robert established a prosperous farm in the new land, and their first child, Margaret, was born there in 1836. Their son, Clement Vann, familiarly known as \\"Clem\\", was born January 11, 1839.\\"Will Rogers:a biography.\\" University of Oklahoma Press. Excerpt from Chapter 1. Accessed March 14, 2017. Early life Clem exhibited a disdain for formal education. Although his mother pushed him into attending school, she had to stand in the road when he left the house and make sure he followed the path to school, rather than going in a different direction. He first attended a Baptist missionary school, about a mile from his home. Then went to the Cherokee Male Seminary in Talequah, but soon dropped out to work as a hand on a ranch owned by Joel M. Bryan. On May 15, 1855, Clem and 15 other cowboys began to drive 500 longhorn steers to sell in Kansas City. They found no buyers there, so continued the drive to St. Louis, an additional . The journey took four months and proved Clem's endurance and tenacity. Marriage and family Never lacking self-confidence or ambition, Clem decided to establish his own ranch. First, he had to persuade his mother and stepfather to give him twenty-five cows, a bull, four horses, and two slaves, Rabb and Houston, who had belonged to his father. In 1856, Clem and his entourage moved west until they came to a tributary of the Caney River, west of the present town of Talala, Oklahoma. In 1858, Clem Rogers married Mary America Schrimsher. Clem had met Mary while he was attending school in Talequah. They shared some important characteristics. Both were born in 1839 in the Cherokee Nation West (after their parents moved to Indian Territory from Arkansas), both were of mixed blood. Clem and Mary were very different in some other respects. Mary's black hair, broad face and narrow cheekbones emphasized her Indian ancestry. Clem looked more European because he had sandy hair, blue eyes and a bushy mustache. He was taciturn and had a gruff nature, while she was said to be vivacious, sweet and funny, as well as an excellent musician and dancer. He was indifferent about religion, while she was a devout Methodist. Despite their differences, they remained a devoted couple. The Schrimsher and Rogers families have been called part of the \\"Cherokee elite\\". They were English- speaking, mixed-blood, relatively affluent slave owners who had relatively large farms or plantations, and who had adopted many \\"civilized\\" practices, such as sending their children to white or at least missionary schools. Many of this group were not adamantly opposed to moving west, when the white government in Washington, D. C. pressured them to do so. This group became the nucleus of what would become known as the \\"Treaty Party\\". The large majority of Cherokees were full-bloods, unable to speak English, non-slaveholders, subsistence farmers, clung to traditional ways of living, chose not to intermarry with whites and adamantly opposed to the idea of giving up their homeland in the Southeast to move across the Mississippi River. Often called the \\"Conservatives\\", they lined up with Principal Chief John Ross and his National party which controlled the tribal government before removal. Civil War When the American Civil War broke out, Clem, like a majority of the mixed-blood Cherokees, favored the faction of Cherokees that supported the Confederates. At first, Chief John Ross tried to keep the tribe neutral, but many of his full-blood followers privately supported the Union. Soon his ranch was raided by a party of Jayhawkers, and ran off all his cattle. Clem enlisted as an officer in the Confederate Army unit led by Stand Watie. \\"Clem became associated with the brilliant Cherokee leader, William Penn Adair\\",Love 1970, p. 390 and named his son William Penn Adair Rogers after him.

FS-391 operated with a U.S. Coast Guard crew in the Southwest Pacific area. The ship was acquired by the U.S. Navy in 1948. She was configured as a transport and cargo ship and served with the U.S. Pacific Fleet ‚Äì including highly decorated service during the Korean War ‚Äì until decommissioned in 1955. U.S. Army FS-391, a Design 381 (Vessel, Supply, Diesel, Steel, 177') U.S. Army Freight and Supply vessel, was launched in 1944 by United States Concrete Pipe Corp. of Los Angeles, California and commissioned at Los Angeles on 28 July 1944 with LTJG Ted C. Larsen, USCGR, assuming command, relieving Lt Thomas A. Buddy, USCGR. He was succeeded by LTJG Henry P. Mistrey, USCGR, who in turn was succeeded on 10 October 1945, by LTJG George W. Litchfield, USCGR. She was assigned to and operated in the Southwest Pacific area. U.S. Navy FS-391 was acquired by the Navy on 2 February 1948, modified for Naval service and classified as a miscellaneous auxiliary, commissioned as USS Hewell (AG-145) at Pearl Harbor on 5 June 1948, Lt. (j.g.) John W. Hinkleman in command. Hewell's shakedown cruise initially took her across the central Pacific Ocean to Midway Islands, Guam and Saipan. Attached to the Service Force, Pacific Fleet, Hewell carried supplies between Navy bases throughout the central Pacific. Redesignated a light cargo ship or AKL-14 in June 1949 she continued her duties of transporting cargo among the Pacific Islands, including the Caroline Islands and the Marshall Islands. Korean War operations After the North Korean communist attack on South Korea in June 1950 Hewell shifted her base of operations to Japan in July, from there shuttling supplies and ammunition between Japan, Okinawa and Guam to Korea. The light cargo ship returned to her normal inter-island cargo carrying routine in October, remaining on that duty until August 1951 when she sailed to Pearl Harbor for overhaul. From November 1951 to March 1953, Hewell transported supplies and ammunition on the shuttle route from Japan and Korea, conducting an unglamorous but vital role in helping to keep UN forces in \\"beans and bullets\\". After another overhaul at Yokosuka Japan from 10 April thru 9 June 1953 the light cargo ship resumed supply runs from Japan for the troops in Korea. On 31 July 1953 the ship picked up 200 South Korean Marines in Wonsan for transport to South Korea The end of hostilities in August 1953 did not end her supply missions and Hewell remained on that duty through mid-1954. In June of that year, she made a cruise through the central Pacific island bases before arriving at Pearl Harbor in July. Filming Mister Roberts In late August 1954 Hewell departed Hawaii for Midway Island, mooring at the Naval Base there on 28 August to help film the Warner Brothers movie Mister Roberts. The film, starring Henry Fonda, James Cagney, William Powell and Jack Lemmon, was partially shot on board Hewell, with underway footage filmed off Midway harbor between 1‚Äì16 September. The light cargo ship then sailed back to Hawaii between 24 and 29 September and additional film was shot off Kaneohe Bay between 30 September and 7 October. Small alterations were made to the ship and a stage set built to create the \\"palm tree deck\\" and access to it. The crew in the movie is seen going below into what is actually an FS/AKL hold. Each crewmember received a check for $200 and a lighter with Hewell and Mr. Roberts engraved for their appearance. Occasional claims are made that another ship was the exterior film set for the movie; however, evidence, including the Navy's official Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships (DANFS), make clear that Hewell was the ship. Inactivation and sale Shortly thereafter, Hewell sailed east to Astoria, Oregon, remaining there until she decommissioned 15 March 1955 and joined the Columbia River Group, Pacific Reserve Fleet. Hewell remained there until 1 November 1959 when she was stricken from the Navy List and sold to Steve Pickard on 2 June 1960. The ship was scrapped at Lake Union, Seattle, Washington c. 1973. Honors and awards Hewell received seven battle stars for Korean service: * North Korean Aggression * Communist China Aggression * Inchon Landing * Second Korean Winter * Korean Defense Summer-Fall 1952 * Third Korean Winter * Korean Summer-Fall 1953 Hewell also was entitled to display the American Campaign Medal, the Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal, the World War II Victory Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, and the United Nations Korea Medal.

The principal source is the biography by the Hugo Obermaier Society for Palaolithic Research, indicated among the external links  Career  Hugo Obermaier spent his childhood and the early part of his student years in Regensburg. In 1900 he was ordained as a diocesan priest and between 1901 and 1904 he studied in Vienna the subjects of Prehistoric archaeology, physical geography, geology, palaeontology, ethnology, German philology and human anatomy. Among his teachers at this time the most important were Albrecht Penck, Josef Szombathy and Moritz Hoernes. In 1904, he gained a doctorate with a dissertation on The Diffusion of Humankind during the Ice Age in Middle Europe. Four years later, he qualified as a lecturer and in 1909, despite opposition from Albrecht Penck, his former teacher, he became an unsalaried university lecturer in Vienna. In 1911 he took up a professorial post at the newly founded Institute of Human Palaeontology in Paris, which he held until the outbreak of the First World War. In that period he was working with Wernert and Henri Breuil at the caves of El Castillo and the Cueva de La Pasiega in Cantabria. While in Spain (1914) he next decided to work at the National Museum of Natural Sciences in Madrid, but changing again in 1922 to a professorship at the Complutense University in Madrid. He dug at the Cave of Altamira in 1924-5, and collaborated with Breuil in their publication in 1935. His work with Frobenius included the study of the Neolithic rock engravings of south Oran in 1925. Scientific, personal and political considerations were the cause for his refusal to go back to Germany when, in 1933, he declined the invitation to take up the Max Ebert Chair in Berlin. After the outbreak of the civil war, in 1939 he left there to take up a Professorship in Fribourg in Switzerland. Hugo Obermaier died after a long illness in the Theological hostel in Fribourg.  Hugo Obermaier Society  The scientific contributions of H. Obermaier lay primarily in research into the Old Stone Age, which he was one of the first to recognise as being a field for serious scientific research. In order to pay respect to his memory and equally to advance scientific investigations into the Palaeolithic, on 23 June 1951 archaeologists, geologists, palaeontologists and anthropologists formed a society led by Lothar Zotz. In 1956 the name \\"Hugo Obermaier Society for Research into the Ice Age and the Stone Age\\" was adopted.

It is part of the Church of Scotland, and (along with Yester Church and Bolton Parish Church) serves the parish of Yester, Bolton and Saltoun, which includes the villages of Gifford, Bolton, East Saltoun and West Saltoun. The church lies in the centre of the village. History The first church in Saltoun Parish was built in 1244 by the Bishop of St Andrews, and was dedicated to Saint Michael. During the brief establishment of Episcopacy in Scotland in 1633, the church (and the control of electing a minister) was transferred to the Bishop of Edinburgh, before being passed to Andrew Fletcher, Lord Innerpeffer (the local land-owner) in 1643. Wyllie, Margaret, A History of Saltoun and the Fletcher Family, Saltoun, 1986: 10 Gilbert Burnet (later the Bishop of Salisbury) started his ministry at Saltoun in 1665. During his five years there, he enlarged the church. He left in 1669 to become Professor of Divinity at Glasgow University and, later, Bishop of Salisbury. Wyllie, Margaret, 1986: 11 The present church building was built in 1805, probably by the architect Robert Burn. The church is cruciform in shape, with the vestry and steeple occupying the eastern arm. Below the church is the burial vault of the Fletchers of Saltoun Hall and in which is interred the body of Andrew Fletcher, (1655-1716) the politician and writer.

Members of this clerical congregation, known popularly as Piamartini, add the abbreviation ‚ÄúF.N.‚Äù after their names.  History  The institute was founded by Italian priest Saint Giovanni Battista Piamarta, parish priest to Brescia. He was always sensitive to the problems of young people of the working class and opened agricultural and craft schools for them. In 1900 this gave birth to a new congregation of priests who devote themselves to the care of children of the people, especially those without families, caring and professional education. The Holy See approved the establishment by Decree of January 10, 1948.  Activities and dissemination  The Piamartini are a community of priests consecrated to God, as well as laity who are dedicated to training young people to Christian life through socialization and work. Their motto is \\"Pietas et Labor\\" (Piety and Labor). The Congregation is present in Italy, Brazil, Angola and Chile. As of December 31, 2005, the congregation had 23 houses and 137 religious, 93 of them priests.  Other foundations  Over the years the congregation has added others that support the activities of the Piamartini: * Piamarta Onlus Foundation, which has a support those working in education; * Operation Good, an association that collects aid for the mission Fortaleza/Pacot√≠, and in particular through distance adoptions; * Service Collaboration International Assistance Piamartino Foundation, is an NGO (non-governmental organization) which aims to \\"promote and manage useful cooperation to promote human progress, economic and social integration of developing countries\\"; * Piamartino Secular Movement, born from the desire of some laity to share the spiritual experience of the Congregation, maintaining, however, the commitment to the active life. The movement provides participation through three stages: Accession, promises and votes (poverty, chastity, obedience). * Piamartino Youth Movement, which brings together young people who want to live the values proposed by Piamarta: prayer, commitment at work, and a positive social openness.

Positioned on a hill top ridge, Madonna di Confine, overlooking the Carpini valley 450 metres above sea level, this strategic site served the dual purposes of holding the high ground and allowing the knights stationed there views of approach routes. On observing an approaching enemy the knights would signal Montone via line of sight. The warning time was sufficient to allow the citizens of Montone to retreat to defensive positions.  Architecture  Ancillary structures clustered around the central tower housed the garrison's knights and horses. Over the centuries the architecture has reflected the use of the site. Originally a place of worship in the 8th century, additional structures were added for defensive military purposes in the 10th and 12th centuries. Eventually the site was used as a farm, with most of the structures falling into disrepair.Moravola, Bill Thayer, University of Chicago. Umbria, Italy website Interior staircase Path leading to Moravola In 1999 the site was purchased by architect Christopher Chong and designer Seonaid Mackenzie, who embarked on a nine-year renovation program. Chong had worked on projects for James Stirling and Norman Foster, including the shopping areas of Hong Kong International Airport at Chek Lap Kok, Hong Kong. Local Italian construction codes required that new structures be confined to the footprints of existing structures and that basic historical attributes be maintained. The original floors and plans of the main tower had long since been lost, giving the design team a free hand to build, so long as the external building's exterior shell was preserved.

A significant proportion of a building's carbon footprint comes from the manufacture of building materials, and the heating and cooling of a building's interior envelope. Reusing the building's outer shell and foundations reduces the need for new building materials. Heating and cooling is achieved without the need for air conditioning and its associated acoustic noise intrusion. In the summer, the most popular time for visitors, the tower is cooled naturally by three thermodynamic features. The seven tower suites are built around a central staircase tower core, whose height gives rise to natural convection currents that draws cool air from lower levels and exhausts hot air at the rooftop. Secondly, the thermal mass of the 12th-century tower stone exterior provides a thermodynamic reservoir, absorbing energy during the day, and releasing that energy during the cooler nights. Finally, the location of the tower on a hill top ridge allows it to escape the higher temperatures of the valley below. Terrace overlooking Carpini valley Swimming pool The swimming pool is located on a higher elevation, south of the main tower building (see section and plan). The pool walls are painted the unusual color black, to enhance the optical properties of the pool's infinity edge. The tower, when viewed from the south poolside pavilion, is seen to be rising as if from a castle's moat. Solar evacuated tube collectors are used to provide pool and building heating efficiently, due to the near optimal thermal load matching of solar energy in low temperature difference applications. Local building materials were used whenever possible, in particular Pietra Serena, a blue-grey stone from a local quarry. This stone is the same as is used on the floors of Apple stores worldwide. The use of local stone, stone being a relatively heavy building material, has a significant reduction on trucking costs and environmental impact. One of the more novel uses of Pietra Serena is for the sinks and baths. In order to achieve the high precision required CNC machine tools were used to custom cut and shape solid stone blocks. The use of stone floors also allows for the use of a hydronic underfloor heating system, with the advantages of silent operation and good efficiency, because of the emissivity and absorpivity of stone. Interior stairs in the duplex suites make use of materials originally engineered for exterior applications. The custom designed stairs are constructed of COR-TEN B steel (ASTM A 588), giving them a durable rustic appearance. The rustic theme is also mirrored in the wood grain patterns imprinted in the concrete walls. All concrete structures are constructed using concrete forms, usually made of steel. The resulting finish of steel shuttered concrete can be extremely precise, an example of which is Tadao Ando's Church of the Light. The cost is high, however, because each steel form needs to be custom made, and then positioned accurately. Moravola's walls used wooden forms, which, in addition to the cost savings, allowed easy fabrication within the existing historical 10th-century structure. The tower interiors have been restored with a modernistic design approach that complements auxiliary buildings, terraces and pool areas to create a contemporary retreat.Ville Giardini. Nella torre zen. Testo Di Marco Biagi. Maggio 2009. pp. 62-72. The structures are aligned on an axis with the tower to maximize panoramic views over the Carpini valley, a view unchanged since medieval times, and an escape from the modern world.

Any ball may be nominated and selected as the ball 'on' for the continuation shot; which, after being pocketed, must be re-spotted. Missing either the free shot or the continuation shot ends the player's innings. However, if the player elects to shoot a penalty shot, the penalty ball is re-spotted and the next shot taken must be a free shot. In contrast to free or continuation shots, missing a penalty shot is not only the end of an innings but also a foul. Every foul awards an opponent with 7 points.

Huntley played collegiate lacrosse at Johns Hopkins University where he helped his team win two national championships. In 1979, Huntley was honored with the McLaughlin Award, which is presented annually to the nation's most outstanding college lacrosse midfielder. His son, Kevin Huntley, was also an All-American at Johns Hopkins. Huntley was also the first ever head coach for the Toronto Nationals. David Huntley died December 18, 2017 after suffering a heart attack while attending a box lacrosse game in Delray Beach, Florida. Playing career Huntley grew up in Toronto, Ontario playing box lacrosse, an indoor version of the game which is played most commonly in Canada. Huntley was recruited to play field lacrosse for the Johns Hopkins Blue Jays, playing from 1976 to 1979, and helping the team win two consecutive national championships, in 1978 and 1979. While playing with the Blue Jays he was named a three time All-American, was awarded as the nation's most outstanding midfielder in 1979 when he was presented with the McLaughlin Award, and played on three straight NCAA finals teams. He finished his college career as the leading goal scorer at Johns Hopkins among midfielders. Huntley also played internationally and was a member of Team Canada‚Äôs gold medal winning 1978 World Lacrosse Championship team. Huntley and his son Kevin Huntley, also a former All-American at Johns Hopkins, are the only father-son duo to win two national championships, and are only the second pairing to score 100 or more goals each in their respective Division I lacrosse careers. Coaching career Huntley's career in professional lacrosse began in the inaugural season of the Eagle Pro Box Lacrosse League (a predecessor of the National Lacrosse League) in 1987 when he served as the Philadelphia Wings general manager and coach. As general manager, he recruited lacrosse stars Mike French, John Tucker, and John Grant, Sr. to play for his team. During the season, due to team injuries, Huntley stepped down from his coaching position and joined the team as a player. In two games, Huntley scored three goals. In subsequent seasons, Huntley worked in various capacities for the Baltimore Thunder, Pittsburgh Crossefire, Washington Power and Colorado Mammoth. Huntley has been an assistant coach, at times, for Loyola College in Maryland, the Baltimore Bayhawks of Major League Lacrosse, and four times for Team Canada in World Lacrosse Championship competitions. Huntley served as Assistant Coach for the 2006 World Lacrosse Championship gold medal winning Canadian team. In 2008, Huntley returned to Philadelphia to be Head Coach of the Wings. The 2008 Philadelphia Wings season marked the first season in five years that the Wings made the playoffs, ending the longest playoff drought in the history of the franchise. Following the 2010 season, Huntley was also named General Manager of the Wings, following Lindsay Sanderson's firing. Prior to the 2009 MLL season, Huntley was named the head coach of the expansion Toronto Nationals in Major League Lacrosse. He and the Nationals went on to win the 2009 MLL Championship with a 10-9 win over the Denver Outlaws. The following season, the Nationals went 3-9 and missed the playoffs. On January 12, 2011, Huntley resigned as head coach of the Nationals. He served as an offensive coordinator at Calvert Hall.

Following in the tradition of other Magic blocks, Ravnica takes place in a plane of the multiverse that was previously unexplored in the game's backstory. The world of Ravnica is an ecumenopolis, a vast city that covers the entire surface of its planet, and is home to a diverse assortment of sentient races. Much power in Ravnica is held by the ten \\"guilds\\", political factions that each represent a combination of two of Magics five colors. The mythology of Ravnica is loosely derived from Slavic folklore, and the character names reflect this. This plane was revisited in the Return to Ravnica block, and the Guilds of Ravnica, Ravnica Allegiance and War of the Spark sets.  Design  Ravnica was conceived following the success of Invasion. Invasion, released in 2000, emphasized interactions between the colors, and it was one of Magic's most popular releases. Magic's lead designer, Mark Rosewater, wanted to expand on the multicolor theme in a new way. Therefore, the design of Ravnica is based around ten two-color pairs, including cards in which those pairs of colors work in concert. The Ravnica cycle is functionally different from the Invasion cycle due to how the multicolored or multicolor-themed cards are distributed among the three sets that make up each cycle.https://www.wizards.com/magic/multiverse/planes.aspx?plane=ravnica In the Invasion cycle, for example, the first two sets (Invasion and Planeshift) centered around friendly color pairs; in each of the five featured combinations of three colors (Nightscape/Crosis, Stormscape/Dromar, Sunscape/Treva, Thornscape/Rith, and Thunderscape/Darigaaz), two of them would be enemies of each other but both would be allies of a third central color (example: in a card like Ancient Spring that focuses on the white/blue/black combination, white and black are enemies of each other but both are allies of blue). The last set, Apocalypse, emphasized enemy color pairs; in each of the five featured combinations of three colors (\\"Ana\\", \\"Ceta\\", \\"Dega\\", \\"Necra\\", and \\"Raka\\"), two of them would be allies of each other but both would be enemies of the third (example: for Urborg Elf, blue and black are allies of each other but enemies of green). However, the color combinations that are featured in each set of the Ravnica cycle are determined by which guilds are important in that stage of the story. All the multicolor cards in the Ravnica cycle (and many other cards) are associated with one of the ten guilds. Ravnica emphasized Boros, Dimir, Golgari, and Selesnya; Guildpact emphasized Gruul, Izzet, and Orzhov; and Dissension emphasized Azorius, Rakdos, and Simic.  Mechanics  Ravnica introduces hybrid mana. Each symbol is a circle halved diagonally, in which the top left half is one color and the bottom right half another. A smaller version of the color's icon (sun for white, skull for black, etc.) appears in the corresponding half. These mana symbols mean that mana of either color may be used to pay it; for example, a spell whose mana cost is two green/white hybrid mana may be played using two green mana, two white mana, or one green and one white. The cards with these mana symbols have a colored border that fades from left to right, out of one color and into the other; and are counted as both colors. Each of the ten guilds has a new keyword or ability word associated with it. * Radiance (red/white, Boros): Radiance is an ability word that appears on spells and abilities that affect every permanent that shares a color with the target permanent (usually of the same type). When played on multi-colored cards, the effect spreads to all that card's colors. * Convoke (green/white, Selesnya): A player playing a spell with Convoke may tap some of his or her creatures to pay part or all of the card's mana cost. Each creature tapped reduces the cost by one mana of that creature's color, or by one colorless mana. * Dredge (black/green, Golgari): Cards with dredge may be returned from the graveyard to their owner's hand, provided that player opts to skip drawing a card and instead puts a number of cards from the top of his or her library into the graveyard. For example, for a card with \\"Dredge 3\\", you can skip your draw and put three cards from the top of your deck to the graveyard to add the card to your hand. * Transmute (blue/black, Dimir): A player may pay three mana of certain colors and discard a card with Transmute from his or her hand. Doing this allows the player to find a card with the same converted mana cost from that player's library, reveal it, and put it into his or her hand. For example, Brainspoil, has converted mana cost 5 with Transmute for 1 colorless and 2 black mana, and if you choose to transmute it, you pay the mana cost and discard it, then search your library for anything converted mana cost 5, reveal it, and put it into your hand. You can only Transmute as a sorcery. * Haunt (white/black, Orzhov): When a creature or spell with Haunt is put into a graveyard, it is removed from the game haunting a creature in play. When the haunted creature is put into a graveyard, the creature or spell with Haunt can perform an effect again. * Bloodthirst (red/green, Gruul): When creatures with Bloodthirst are played, they gain a boost to their power and toughness if an opponent was already dealt damage that turn. For example, a 2/3 creature with Bloodthirst 3 could come into play as a 5/6. * Replicate (blue/red, Izzet): Spells with Replicate allow a given cost to be paid any number of times, and the spell is copied that many times. Each copy can have a new target. * Hellbent (black/red, Rakdos): Cards with the Hellbent ability word gain additional attributes when their controllers have no cards in their hand. It is very similar to the Odyssey block's threshold ability, but revolves around the hand instead. * Graft (green/blue, Simic): Similar to Modular from the Mirrodin block, cards with the Graft ability come into play with +1/+1 counters in accordance with the number associated with their Graft ability. When another creature comes into play, a card with Graft may move one of its +1/+1 counters onto that creature. * Forecast (white/blue, Azorius): Rather than play a card from his or her hand, a player may use its Forecast ability during his or her upkeep, and only once per turn. To use Forecast, the player pays a cost and reveals the card with Forecast in his/her hand. Forecast effects are often either a lesser version of the main spell or a support effect for the main spell. A card with similar mechanic, , was first seen in Unglued. Ravnica block includes many mono-color cards which encourage people to play with multiple colors. Ravnica: City of Guilds featured cards which have activated abilities that use mana of different color from the cards' color. Guildpact introduced cards which are enhanced if another mana color is used to play the card. In Dissension, in addition to the first 'group' of abilities, another group of mono-color cards have abilities associated with two colors, but must be played with mana of a different color or else the card must be sacrificed. An example is . It is a white creature with a life gain effect (white's specialty), as well as unblockability (blue's specialty). However, if Azorius Herald is played without blue mana, it must be sacrificed just after it comes into play. Dissension features the return of the popular split card mechanic originally from Invasion and Apocalypse. There are 10 gold split cards representing some combinations of the other guilds of Ravnica. The allied color guilds are represented in uncommon split cards, whereas the enemy color guilds are represented in rare split cards.  Storyline  Each of the guilds had been at war with each other for centuries, and the only thing that made the leaders agree to a truce was the fact that the dead had begun haunting the plane. They decided that each guild would specialize in two colors of magic and have specific jobs in the city to stretch the limited resources and maintain order, including by banning war completely. The game and novels begin 9999 years after the Guildpact was formed, on the eve of the decamillennial celebrations. All three books were written by Cory J. Herndon and published by Wizards of the Coast. Ravnica As the preparations for the celebrations are getting finished, tensions between the guilds have reached the breaking point. Things aren't helped any by the fact that, while many don't believe it exists anymore, the still very much alive House Dimir never agreed to the Guildpact. They, along with the Golgari Swarm, almost destroy the core of Selesnyan civilization. Agrus Kos (A Wojek officer in the Boros Legion), Jarad (Brother of the Devkarin leader Savra), Fonn Zurich (Daughter of a Wojek officer who joined the Selesnya Conclave after her dad's death), Feather (A Firemane angel who worked with Kos), Pivlic (An Orzhov businessman), and Savra (The leader of the Golgari Devkarin elves) are the main characters in the novel who each play their own role. They all come together eventually, and quite a bit of chaos ensues. Savra then tries to take over her guild and resurrect the necromancer Svogthir, and all the characters are thrown into a huge war. The dark undercity's the domain of the Devkarin elves, and that's where Jarad and the rest run the city with necromancy and hunting skill; while the skies above are policed by Boros angels. They both stay to their own sections, so the Selesnya keep passageways clear with the Ledev, a group of paramilitary soldiers who defend the right of free travel. Fonn, an elite Ledev, guards her priest friend while he travels to the decimillenial celebrations, but an explosion tears through the city and kills him, flings Fonn into Jarad's arms, and causing a lot of trouble for Kos. With a partner dead (although continuing to appear in the plot in the form of a ghost), Kos embarks on the investigation that takes him throughout the various settings of Ravnica. This involves conflict with some of the most powerful guilds of the plane, with no end in sight to the fighting.Ravnica: Ravnica, Book 1; by Cory Herndon Guildpact Like its predecessor, Ravnica: City of Guilds, Guildpact stars Agrus Kos and his business partner/friend Pivlic, as well as several new characters. With their new friend Teysa Karlov, Orzhov baroness of the diseased frontier zone named Utvara, the two begin to unravel an Izzet secret that delves deeper than any of them thought, all the while searching for the missing messenger of Zomaj Hauc, Izzet Guild upper manager and lead engineer of the Cauldron, a powerplant supplying energy to all of the Utvara region. Crix the goblin finds herself in the hands of the indigenous peoples of Utvara while Baroness Teysa and her minions attempt to gain control of the region that has now become hers to own. But Crix finds that the plains around Utvara are mysterious, full of bizarre creatures that trace back to the ancient days of Ravnica, as well as a race of people who wear fungus on their backs to protect themselves from a spore that got thrown up into the air after the Izzet Guild attempted to \\"reclaim\\" the Utvaran region for the previous owner, Teysa's uncle and prodigal father. But as Crix stays out in the spores, strange occurrences with the natives cause her to doubt the truths she holds dear. Crix manages to manipulate the natives into helping her get to the Cauldron, partially to deliver the message she had been sent to deliver and partially to get to the bottom of this deadly mystery. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to the courier, Agrus Kos and Pivlic have also become aware of the strange behaviors of the natives and begin an expedition to rescue the intrepid Izzet. However, as they work forward toward their goal, both the human and the imp find that it is not as easy of a task as it originally appeared, especially not when the Nephilim, the ancient creatures Crix encounters, become more rampant in this area of the frontier. Since kidnapping is a crime, Kos is propelled forward, but unfortunately for him, his path leads straight to the gates of the Cauldron. Back in Utvara, things seem to be simple and reclaiming the once lost territory is becoming a task that Teysa Karlov has turned into a lucrative business venture. But while business continues to improve, Teysa begins to uncover a mystery that's plagued her for her entire life. All the issues that go along with it are getting to be too much for someone like her who's getting up in her years. It all culminates in the first Baroness of the Orzhov meeting her enemies face to face.Guildpact: Ravnica Cycle, Book 2; by Cory Herndon Guilds Of the ten guilds that rule Ravnica, four are the focus of this first set in the block. The next expansion, Guildpact, focused only on three other guilds, and the last set in the block, Dissension, introduced the last three guilds. Each guild corresponds to a different two- color combination. The guilds featured in the Ravnica block are: * The Boros Legion (red/white, Ravnica: City of Guilds): The militaristic guild, they act as enforcers of order on Ravnica, and are not against using force to keep the peace. The Boros Legion is epitomized by the actions of the Wojek League, the police force of Ravnica. They are inspired by the archangel Razia.Razia The champion, Agrus Kos,Agrus Kos is a Wojek police officer and was the main character in the Ravnica novels. * House Dimir (blue/black, Ravnica: City of Guilds): A shadowy guild that few of the common people of Ravnica are sure still exists. The other nine guilds know it does, and that it traffics in secrets, employing a network of spies and assassins to discover them and enforce their use in blackmail. It is led by the eldritch psionic vampire SzadekSzadek and the mysterious champion of the guild Circu, Dimir Lobotomist.Circu, Dimir Lobotomist *The Golgari Swarm (black/green, Ravnica: City of Guilds): A sect which emphasizes that death is an essential aspect of the life cycle, and which to that end encourages death and plague in order to foster regrowth. They are ruled by a trio of sibling gorgons called The Sisters of Stone DeathThe Sisters of Stone Death (Lydya, Lexya and Ludmilla), but their rule is being contested by the elvish shaman Savra.Savra * The Selesnya Conclave (green/white, Ravnica: City of Guilds): A quasi-monastic order whose members are zealously dedicated to keeping life in balance. The Conclave disapproves strongly of individuality, holding that the good of the whole is always more important than that of a single being. It is directed by The Chorus of the Conclave,The Chorus of the Conclave a group of mostly ancient dryads. A preacher named Tolsimir WolfbloodTolsimir Wolfblood is their champion. *The Izzet League (blue/red, Guildpact): Like mad scientists, the Izzet are responsible for almost all of the beneficial technologies and magics that keep Ravnica running. Unfortunately, their impulsive and reckless research principles mean that just as many have failed experiments with explosive results. Their guild leader is an extremely intelligent but temperamental and egotistic dragon wizard named Niv-Mizzet, the Firemind. The champions of the Izzet are a husband-wife pair of wizards named Tibor and Lumia.https://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Article.aspx?x=magic/guildpact/izzet *The Gruul Clans (red/green, Guildpact): The Gruul Clans were originally the Guild of Savage Nature, appointed to speak for and protect the people who lived in the harsh natural environments of Ravnica. As the city expanded over nature, the other nine guilds (specifically the other Green-oriented guilds) began appointing themselves as nature's defenders. Eventually phased out entirely by the rest of the guilds, the Gruul fractured into a myriad of different clans, all bent on destroying civilization. Some do it for revenge, others simply because they like to smash stuff. The biggest clan is ruled by the cyclops Borborygmos. Despite not being affiliated with any of the clans, the members view Ulasht, the Hate Seed, as their champion as it represents all they stand for. Domri Rade, a planeswalker from this clan cast a spell, entrancing Zach, another planeswalker into becoming the Guild leader. *The Orzhov Syndicate (white/black, Guildpact): While masquerading as a religion, the Orzhov are actually Mafia-like business people. With no economic transaction that isn't directly or indirectly under their control, they are directed by the Ghost Council of Orzhova, composed of the spirits of former Orzhov Patriarchs and Matriarchs. Teysa, Orzhov Scion, is the champion of the guild, and plays a major part in the book series. * The Azorius Senate (white/blue, Dissension): The lawmakers of Ravnica, founded by Azor, hence the name Azorius Senate. The Senate is obsessed with keeping the status quo, no matter the cost. Their current leader, Grand Arbiter Augustin IV, believes that the best way to serve the city is to make any sort of action illegal. For his hierarchical and bureaucratic guild, history, stability, and the rule of law are paramount. The Grand Arbiter consults a sphinx known as Isperia the Inscrutable, who is the champion of the Azorius. * The Simic Combine (green/blue, Dissension): The Simic's original role was to protect and preserve what was left of Ravnica's natural ecosystems. Despite their best efforts, they failed, and there is no place on Ravnica that is left to nature. Now, the Simic Combine spends their resources creating new - and often frightening - species of creatures that not only survive in the stone jungles of Ravnica, but thrive. The guild is headed by the distant and cool elvish biomancer Momir Vig, Simic Visionary. The Simic champion is known as Experiment Kraj, the culmination of all of Vig's previous experiments. It is intended to be the ultimate life form and rapidly \\"adapts\\" to change. * The Cult of Rakdos (black/red, Dissension): Named after its demon leader, Rakdos the Defiler. The Cult of Rakdos is completely self-absorbed, out only for a good time. However, their idea of a \\"good time\\" usually involves murder and mayhem ‚Äì the more bloody and depraved, the better. The cult would love to rule Ravnica and turn it into one big slaughter-fest, but to them, it's the process of random death and destruction that is fulfilling, not the goal. Fortunately for the Rakdos, their interest in the dark art of death has made them into top-notch mercenaries and assassins, which the other guilds are more than happy to take advantage of. The guild's champion is Lyzolda, the Blood Witch. She is at the forefront of most of the guild's macabre sacrificial ceremonies. Each guild has the following cards: * A legendary leader, whose mana cost includes two mana of each of the guild's colors. * A legendary champion, whose abilities encourage players to play with cards of both of the guild's colors. The champion includes one mana of each of the guild's colors in its cost. ** Note: The aforementioned definition of guild leader and guild champion is solely based on game mechanics, not the story. Some guilds have the properties of their champions and leaders swapped around. * A signet, cluestone, and locket, which are common artifacts that produce one mana of each of the guild's colors. * A common \\"karoo\\" or \\"bounce\\" land, which returns a land to hand when it comes into play (tapped), but produces 2 mana of the guild's colors. * An uncommon \\"guildhome\\" land, which produces colorless mana but has a special ability. * A rare \\"shock\\" land that has two basic land types (even though it is non-basic), which can be tapped for one of two possible colors of mana. * A rare guild-affiliated artifact. * Three hybrid mana cards, one per rarity level; the uncommon one is always a \\"guildmage\\" which costs two hybrid mana to play, has a power/toughness of 2/2, and has two activated abilities (one associated with each of its colors). The appearance of a guild symbol in the background of a card's text box identifies that card's guild affiliation. For example, the symbol of the green-white Selesnya guild appears on green- white cards, cards with the convoke mechanic, lands that produce green and white mana, and so on. The guild symbols have no effect on game play. Other cycles include the Leylines (one for each color) and the Nephilim (one for each four-color combinations). Notable cards Notable cards of Ravnica: City of Guilds include Dark Confidant and Life from the Loam. Guildpact also includes Magic's first creatures with exactly four colors, the Nephilim. Reception Ravnica won the 2005 Origins Award as \\"Best Collectible Card Game or Expansion\\". Legacy The plane of Ravnica was revisited in the Return to Ravnica block, and the Guilds of Ravnica and Ravnica Allegiance sets. It was also adapted as a campaign setting for the 5th edition of Dungeons & Dragons with the publication of the sourcebook Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica in 2018.
