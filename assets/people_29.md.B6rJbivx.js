Dzu finished second in the election and won 17% of the vote on a platform of negotiating with the National Liberation Front for South Vietnam. Politicians advocating coexistence with communists were not allowed to register; Dzu remained silent on his policies until his candidacy was registered. Dzu and other opposition candidates alleged vote fraud after the poll, but he was arrested after the election on grounds of making illicit currency transactions and jailed by a military court for five years of hard labor. Due to international criticism, he was released after five months.  Before politics  Dzu was born on 10 November 1917 in Qui Nh∆°n, B√¨nh ƒê·ªãnh Province, in the central Vietnam. He was educated in Hanoi, and after graduating with a law degree, moved to the Mekong Delta's largest city C·∫ßn Th∆° to practice in 1944, before relocating to Saigon in 1945. One of Dzu‚Äôs law partners was good friend Nguy·ªÖn H·ªØu Th·ªç, who later left Saigon and went into the countryside to become the nominal political leader of the National Liberation Front, as the Vietcong called itself. That friendship later prompted voters to think that Dzu's promises of negotiated peace between the government of South Vietnam and the communists was viable. Dzu also worked in law with Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn Khi√™m, the younger brother of Madame Nhu, the First Lady and sister-in-law of bachelor President Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám. This benefited Dzu and Tho as the Ngos ran kangaroo courts that were their rubber stamps and Dzu's connections gave him an advantage and the ability to influence judges and law-enforcement agencies. During the Di·ªám era, Dzu visited the United States and joined the Rotary Club and rose to be the organisation's director for Southeast Asia, and was known for wearing his Rotary Club tie. Dzu had also earned negative attention when he once put up his wife as collateral for a loan.Karnow, p. 466.  1961 aborted election bid  Dzu had declared his intention to stand as a candidate for the 1961 South Vietnamese presidential election against President Diem, but he was intimidated into withdrawing after being accused of having engaged in illegal fund transfers out of the country.Trung, p. 1146  1967 election bid  In early-1967, several Americans who were detained on currency-violation charges, something that was routine in South Vietnam, accused Dzu of offering to have them released if they gave him a commission of USD10,000 to bribe the judges. Dzu was put under investigation, but the probe was dropped to allow Dzu to participate in the 1967 presidential election campaign. Under the political laws of the time, political activity that promoted negotiations with the communist Vietcong insurgents that were attempting to take over South Vietnam with the assistance of their ideological allies in North Vietnam, was forbidden. There had been previous instances where politicians that had advocated a ceasefire were disqualified from running.Karnow, p. 465. As a little-known politician, he remained silent until his candidacy was approved before exhibiting his policies. After this was done, he campaigned with the dove as his emblem, urging negotiations. Dzu gained a reputation for being the most dynamic and eloquent of the 11 presidential candidates. He repeatedly assailed Thi·ªáu and his deputy Ky in strident language, accusing them of using dirty tricks to hinder his campaign. Dzu claimed that he had been meeting with the Buddhist activist leader Th√≠ch Tr√≠ Quang, but later denied this. He also claimed that the Vietcong called on communist sympathisers to vote for him, but later reneged on this. While others also advocated peace deals, Dzu was the most vigorous in disseminating his message, making competitors such as the aged Phan Kh·∫Øc S·ª≠u and Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn H∆∞∆°ng, who had briefly served as president and prime minister respectively under the junta's supervision in 1964‚Äì65, appear lethargic. With 17% of the vote, he came second behind the ticket of General Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Thi·ªáu, hitherto the figurehead chief of state, and Air Marshal Nguy·ªÖn Cao K·ª≥, the Prime Minister. Dzu's success caught observers by surprise. Two weeks before the poll, a study by US Embassy officials privately estimated that he would only get around 4% of the vote and come fifth on the popular vote. Of the 44 provinces, Dzu came first in 5 provinces, all of which were under the control of communist guerrillas, and he placed second in 26 provinces behind the Thi·ªáu‚ÄìK·ª≥ ticket. These provinces were also known for being infested with communists. This led to claims the communists had voted for him and forced the population to do so as well. Dzu rebutted this by pointing out that by such logic, the communists had supported Thi·ªáu and were therefore aligned with him. In the accompanying senate election, voters had to choose six out of the 48 candidate groupings, and the six most popular tickets of ten nominees would be elected to the 60-member upper house. Dzu endorsed five tickets, but none were successful. Along with two other failed presidential candidates, S·ª≠u and Hoang Co Binh, Dzu held a media conference accusing Thi·ªáu and K·ª≥ of engaging in election fraud. K·ª≥ had not hidden his distaste for democracy or his opponents during the campaign and had \\"described the civilian candidates as 'ordure' [dirt, filth, excrement], 'traitors', and 'destroyers of the national interest'\\". K·ª≥ went on to say that if his opponents continued to attack him, he would cancel the poll.McAllister, p. 646. Dzu and seven other civilian tickets filed formal complaints against the military for campaign irregularities.McAllister, p. 650. American officials, in line with their support for Thi·ªáu and K·ª≥, dismissed the protests as sour grapes, but a committee from the Constituent Assembly later resolved 16‚Äì2 to void the election results due to \\"a pattern of fraud\\". The finding had no effect as Thi·ªáu and K·ª≥ made a series of arrests and other crackdowns against any civilian dissent. After the election, Dzu claimed to be leader of the opposition to Thi·ªáu and K·ª≥. Dzu's performance was regarded to be a sign of the public discontent with the military rule of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam officers, rather than an endorsement of his policies. Nevertheless, Thieu was embarrassed by the results and had him arrested for illicit currency transactions. Dzu was accused of illegally opening a bank account in San Francisco and was put under police surveillance. Dzu was arrested and brought before a Special Military Court on 26 July 1968 and sentenced to five years of hard labour, but due to public pressure in South Vietnam and abroad, he was released after only five months. After the fall of Saigon in April 1975, accused of contacts with American officials and the Central Intelligence Agency, Dzu was sent to a re-education camp by the new communist government. He is believed to have died in the mid-1980s. Dzu's son, David Truong, who was living in the United States since the mid-1960s, was in 1978 convicted of espionage for the Vietnamese government.

The youngest of two brothers and a sister, he was raised and educated in Greenville, Texas. He studied violin from the age of ten and continued for twelve years. One of his brothers, Lynn Mozart Harrell (1902‚Äì1987), had been a big band pianist with the Jimmy Joy Orchestra while a student at The University of Texas at Austin in the 1920s.Pianist Recalls Golden Age of Jazz, Dallas Morning News, June 4, 1967, Sec. D, pg. 4  Post baccalaureate education  Harrell studied the violin at Oklahoma City University. Later, he was awarded a scholarship to attend Philadelphia's Curtis Institute of Music where he studied violin under Emanuel Zetlin. He met his wife, violinist Marjorie Fulton, while they were both students at the Curtis Institute. It was at the Curtis Institute that the quality of his bass voice was discovered, after which he left Curtis for The Juilliard School to study singing with Anna E. Schoen-Ren√© (1864‚Äì1942), who had been a pupil of Pauline Viardot-Garcia and Manuel Garcia.The Juilliard School Archives Harrell believed that his experience of musical studies as a violinist first made him a better singer than he might have been otherwise.

Fischer.Mack Harrell, The sacred hour of song, a collection of sacred solos suitable for Christian Science services, C.

That same year he won the Metropolitan Opera's Audition of the Air competition (precursor to the National Council Auditions) which led to Edward Johnson offering him a contract with the company. Harrell made his professional opera debut at the Met on December 16, 1939 as Biterolf in Richard Wagner's Tannh√§user. He sang with the company every year through 1948, and returned for the 1949-1950, 1952‚Äì1954, and 1957-1958 seasons.

His final and 156th performance at the Met was as Jochanaan on February 17, 1958 with Inge Borkh as Salome.Metropolitan Opera Archives While performing at the Met, Harrell also maintained an active concert career, and in 1944 he gave the world premiere of Arnold Schoenberg's Ode to Napoleon Buonaparte (1942) for speaker, string orchestra and piano. Harrell performed roles with a number of other opera companies as well. In 1940 he sang Alfio in Cavalleria rusticana and Ford in Verdi's Falstaff in Chicago.

He was best known for his book Roswell: Inconvenient Facts and the Will to Believe. Background Pflock was born in San Jose, California in 1943. He was the son of Ernst H. Pflock (pronounced \\"flock\\" without the 'p'), a book retailer, and Eleanor (n√©e Bracey), an educator. His interest in UFOs started as a young boy when he overheard his friends' fathers discussing a flying saucer containing \\"little alien guys\\" that had, allegedly, crashed in the Southwest. \\"If something like this captures your imagination at that stage of life,\\" he told a San Francisco Examiner reporter, \\"you never get rid of it. It's in the blood.\\" He attended San Jose State University and, in 1964, graduated cum laude with a bachelor's degree in philosophy and political science. From 1960 to 1966, he served in the Marines and Air Force as a reservist. On February 7, 1986, Pflock married Mary E. Martinek, a government affairs director. They had five children: Cynthia, Kurt, Anna, Aaron, and Jennifer. Career After graduation, Pflock was employed at IBM in San Jose, CA, before becoming an intelligence officer with the Central Intelligence Agency in 1966. He remained in that post until 1972. In 1972, Pflock was hired by the American Enterprise Institute, where he worked full-time as a senior editor. During this time, he also served as consulting or contributing editor to Arlington House Publishers, Libertarian Review, Reason magazine, and Eternity Science Fiction. In 1981, Pflock was appointed senior staff member and publications director of the House Republican Conference, working for Jack Kemp primarily on matters of defense. In 1983, he served as Special Assistant for Defense, Space, and Science and Technology to Ken Kramer before being appointed Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Operational Test and Evaluation in 1985. He served under the Reagan Administration. From 1989 to 1992, Pflock worked as a senior strategic planner for BDM International, the U.S. Department of Energy and other corporate agencies. His focus was on environmental restoration and waste management of nuclear test sites. Roswell in Perspective (RiP) In 1992, Pflock began to research and write about UFOs full-time. He focused his research on Roswell, the 1947 incident in which material‚Äîmetallic fabric glued to strange sticks‚Äîwas recovered from an alleged alien crash site. For many believers, this physical evidence proved their case for the existence of flying saucers. In 1994, Pflock wrote his findings in a report titled Rosewell in Perspective (RiP) published by the Fund for UFO Research. At the time, Pflock determined that \\"no flying saucer or saucers crashed in the general vicinity of Roswell or on the Plains of San Agustin in 1947.\\" Pflock also linked the debris found at the Roswell site to Project Mogul, a military balloon experiment meant to detect Soviet nuclear tests. The debris was not alien, but material used to make the balloons. While Pflock continued to believe in the existence of alien spacecraft, he ruled out Roswell, saying it was a \\"case of mistaken identity\\". After the report was made public, Pflock drew the ire of the UFO community, who called him, derisively, a \\"debunker\\". Roswell: Inconvenient Facts and the Will to Believe In 2001, findings from Plfock's eight-year investigation of the Roswell Incident were published in a book titled Roswell: Inconvenient Facts and the Will to Believe, published by Prometheus. In the book, Pflock outlines his journey from \\"hopeful agnostic\\" to a close examination of the photos, drawings, eyewitness reports, and declassified accounts of the incident which lead him to conclude that no evidence existed to support claims of a crashed flying saucer at Roswell. It was Project Mogul, with its high-altitude balloons designed to detect Soviet nuclear tests, not an alien space ship or bodies, that the government wanted kept secret in their, purportedly, botched press conferences. Research for the project was conducted by New York University on behalf of the U.S. Army Air Force. The materials found at the crash site in New Mexico, with its alleged \\"hieroglyphics\\", were made by a novelty company based in New York and consistent with reports made at the time by people who were at the crash site. Some critics within the UFO community rejected Pflock's findings, including Robert Durant, who stated the book bore \\"the hallmark of pathological science\\".

The lake was eventually inundated when the Lake Pedder was flooded as part of a hydroelectric power scheme in 1972.

The fault passes through the west part of the Edgar Dam. The fault is about long. the fault dips to the west 60‚Äì70 degrees. The fault ruptured twice in the Quaternary period, with the early rupture around and the last rupture since glaciation (less than ). The two Quaternary ruptures each elevated the western side by . This is the only fault known to have ruptured twice in the Quaternary period. The fault was discovered by Carey and Newstead in 1960. It cracks up Precambrian rocks in the Jubilee Element. The fault dammed up the water to form a lake. This was later split by partial draining. Lake Edgar is the southern of the two small lakes formed. Average rainfall is per year. Sediment would have rapidly filled the lake if it was old. The earthquakes associated with the formation of the uplifts would be of magnitude 6.6 to 7. The fault separated graphitic phyllite in the east from metasiltstone, argillite, quartz sandstone conglomerate on the west. The Hydro Electric Commission dug a trench through the fault and dug pits to determine if water would leak through the fault when the Edgar Dam was built.

The neighbourhood overlooks the nearby Bukit Timah Hill, hence its name. Ecology Hillview is naturally endowed with lush greenery as it is encircled by the woodlands of Bukit Gombak to the north west, Bukit Batok Nature Park to the south and Bukit Timah Nature Reserve to the east. Nearby are several other nature parks, such as Hindhede Nature Park, Dairy Farm Nature Park, Chestnut Nature Park and the upcoming Rifle Range Nature Park. History=Industrial Past= From the early 1940s to the late 80s, Hillview was an industrial precinct with facilities such as Old Ford Motor Factory (built in 1941), Castrol Oil Company, Union Carbide and Cycle & Carriage Daimler-Benz car assembly plant (built in 1965). Hume Avenue was probably named after Walter R Hume, an inventor turned entrepreneur who founded Hume Pipe Company (Australia). Today, only the old Ford Motor factory still remains as other factories made way for new private residential developments. The KTM Malayan Railway used to operate passenger and freight services that ply through Hillview, from Malaysia in the north to Tanjong Pagar station in the south. Of significance are two railway truss bridges spanning across the undulating terrain near Hillview. Under a bilateral agreement signed between Singapore and Malaysia on 24 May 2010, the railway land has been handed back to Singapore. There are now plans to redevelop the railway land running along Hillview into a Rail Corridor.Rail Corridor Ideas include preserving it as a green corridor, a cyclist highway with direct access into the central business district, gardens and community spaces. =Second World War= Located just beside Bukit Timah Hill, the area witnessed one of the fiercest military encounters in Singapore during World War II as Bukit Timah held strategic and tactical importance to both the Japanese and the British. The Ford Motor FactoryFormer Ford Motor Factory most notably served as the venue on 15 February 1942 for the formal surrender of the Malayan Peninsula by the British Commanding Officer, Lt-Gen. Arthur Ernest Percival, to the Japanese Commander of the 25th Army, Gen. Yamashita Tomoyuki. Infrastructure Apartments along Hillview Avenue Princess Elizabeth Estate,Princess Elizabeth Estate which was previously located along Hillview Avenue's Elizabeth Drive, was built around 1951 to commemorate the wedding of Princess Elizabeth (later Queen Elizabeth II) to Prince Philip (the Duke of Edinburgh) in 1947. There were also public housing built by the Housing Development Board (HDB) around 1979 at the north end of Hillview, with a community centre, a wet market, a hawker centre and some neighbourhood shops. In 1999, the government announced that the HDB estate would be relocated to Bukit Gombak via the largest Selective En-bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS). The residents started the relocation in 2003-2005. By late 2005, the last HDB estate was demolished. Today, as one of the affluent residential areas in Singapore, Hillview boast several private condominiums and landed properties. It is served by nearby restaurants, delicatessens, watering holes, cafes, and convenience stores. A commercial shopping mall, HillV2, located at the beginning of Hillview Avenue houses Cold Storage Market Place, Joyden Canton Kitchen, Starbucks, Cedele, Wine Connection and iO Italian Osteria. Adjacent to HillV2 is a new Hillview Community Club.Hillview Community Club It houses F&B; outlets like Dominos, Schoolhouse by the Bay@Hillview enrichment centre, a dance studio, culinary studio, multi-purpose hall, rooftop garden and other recreational facilities.

His close friend Salimbene refers to him in his Chronicles as \\"one of the most renowned clerics of the world a great preacher and in favour both among the clergy and the people; ever ready to dispute, he was possessed of a fluent speech, and a voice like that of a trumpet; he was a spiritual man ultra modum, so that on hearing him preach one would believe that he was listening to another St. Paul or another Elias.\\" Salimbene also tells us that he was called Hugh of Bareol and that the Lombards knew him as Hugh of Montepesulano. His sister, Douceline of Digne (ca. 1215-74), was the founder of the Beguines of Marseilles. Life Jean de Joinville, in his life of Louis IX (Acta Sanctorum., August, V, xxvii), records the visit of Hugh of Digne to the king. Louis endeavoured to retain him at court, but Hugh set out again on his tour of evangelization. It was while on a similar journey that he wrote to John of Parma, who was then at Greccio, prophesying in his letter, among other things, the death of the pope and of St. Bonaventure, and the extinction of the Order of the Templars. Salimbene considers that the writings of the Abbot Joachim of Flora influenced Hugh of Digne. He certainly took an active and prominent part in the movement of the Franciscan Spirituals. This is evidenced not only from his preaching, but more particularly from his exposition of the Rule of St. Francis and from his other ascetical writings. A biographical sketch of Hugh of Digne in Spanish which is of indifferent critical value, was published in the \\"Chronica Seraphica\\" by Damian Carnejo. He asserts that Hugh of Digne died at Marseilles, where his remains now rest in the Franciscan church of that city beside those of his sister Douceline. Works Among his works is the \\"Tractus de triplici via in sapientiam perveniendi\\", attributed to him by Bartholomew of Pisa in his \\"Conformities\\" (not to be confounded with the \\"Incendium Amoris\\" of Bonaventure, which in several codices bears a similar title). He likewise drew up a set of rules or constitutions for his sister, Douceline of Digne, and other pious women, who formed a sort of religious community known as the Dames de Roubans, with Douceline as their superior.

Growing up, Myers attended an Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) church.Myers, PZ (June 2, 2013). \\"An atheist goes to church ‚Äî 1stLC.\\" Prior to his confirmation, Myers says, \\"I started thinking, you know, I don't believe a word of this.\\" Now an atheist, Myers comments on his blog about science, education, atheism and religion. Education and activism Myers graduated from Kent-Meridian High School in 1975 and subsequently attended DePauw University in Indiana on a full scholarship. However, he returned home the next year after his father suffered a heart attack. He then graduated from the University of Washington in 1979 with Bachelor of Science in zoology. Myers drifted away from this field toward evolutionary developmental biology and obtained a PhD in biology from the University of Oregon.\\"About PZ Myers PZ Myers presents his talk, \\"You, too, can know more molecular genetics than a creationist!\\" at Skepticon in 2014. A self-styled \\"godless liberal\\"Tagline on Pharyngula: \\"Evolution, development, and random biological ejaculations from a godless liberal.\\" and outspoken atheist, he is a vocal critic of all forms of religion, superstition, supernaturalism, spirituality and pseudoscience. He is quoted as having \\"nothing but contempt\\" for intelligent design, arguing that it is \\"fundamentally dishonest\\". He is also an outspoken supporter of sex-positive feminism. Myers believes women should make their own sexual choices without outside pressure. In 2009 Myers was named the American Humanist Association's \\"Humanist of the Year\\". In April 2015, Atheist Ireland issued an official announcement, apologizing that they had given Myers \\"public platforms in Ireland, both at the World Atheist Convention in 2011, and at our international conference in 2013 on Empowering Women Through Secularism\\" and that now it is \\"publicly dissociating itself from the hurtful and dehumanising, hateful and violent, unjust and defamatory rhetoric of the atheist blogger PZ Myers\\". In 2017, Myers, who formerly considered himself one of the \\"New Atheists\\", disassociated himself with the New Atheist label. Describing the label as being applied \\"against our protests, because we were all aware that there was nothing new about it. Maybe we were more aggressive, or maybe suddenly people were listening to us, but really, it was the same old atheism with a fancy artisan label\\". Myers prefers to be simply referred to as an atheist. Post-graduate career Myers has taught and researched at the University of Oregon, the University of Utah and Temple University. He is currently an associate professor of biology at the University of Minnesota's Morris campus. He is a member of Minnesota Citizens for Science Education, and cultivates an interest in cephalopods. Blogging and writing Myers has been active on the internet. He was involved in scientific debates on USENET surrounding the growing creationist movement. He was a founding member of The Panda's Thumb blog. In June 2002, he started his website Pharyngula.org, which morphed into a blog now hosted by ScienceBlogs, Pharyngula, Science Blogs and Freethought Blogs., About >> Pharyngula, Freethought Blogs =Pharyngula= Pharyngula is Myers's personal weblog, promoted as \\"Evolution, development, and random biological ejaculations from a godless liberal.\\", Pharyngula, Freethought Blogs The topics Myers covers are eclectic, delving into the non- scientific as well as scientific. While Pharyngula includes many articles discussing breaking science news and research, the blog has become particularly well known for ridicule of intelligent design and of attempts to insert it into science education. In 2006, the science journal Nature listed Pharyngula as the top-ranked blog written by a scientist. Pharyngula.org was started on June 19, 2002. It started out as an experiment in writing instruction for a class. Students were required to submit mini-essays to be published online. After the project was finished, Myers still had the web- publishing software, and started to use it himself. The blog is named after his favorite stage in embryonic development, the pharyngula stage. Pharyngula moved to hosting at ScienceBlogs, a project of Seed Magazine, in 2005. On Pharyngula, Myers has repeatedly denounced the Discovery Institute, Answers in Genesis, and other creationist websites, as well as offering rebuttals to Intelligent Design, pointing out that its claims are pseudoscientific. Other posts on Pharyngula cover a broad variety of topics that interest Myers. These include cephalopods; science; religion; local, national and international politics, particularly those involving science and/or education; superstition; and evolutionary developmental biology. Myers dismissed the Discovery Institute's petition A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism, stating that the scientists listed didn't have credentials relevant to Biology, and that the number of them was minuscule compared to the scientific community as a whole. On his blog in 2007, Myers reviewed Stuart Pivar's book Lifecode, which argues that self-organization at the embryonic and fetal stages determine the development and final structure of organisms. Myers reviewed the book negatively, stating that the diagrams and ideas in the book arose from Pivar's imagination and had no basis in actual evidence. > How his theory can be reconciled with a large body of embryological evidence > that directly contradicts virtually all of it is not clear, and Pivar has > chosen not to address any of it. And a book full of geometrically > interesting sketches neither explains nor supports Pivar's theory.‚Ä¶ Theories > are supposed to explain observation and experiment. You don't come up with a > theory first, and then invent the evidence to support it. After some discussion in the comments threads of Pharyngula, Pivar sued Myers for libel. Within a week Pivar withdrew the lawsuit, stating that \\"the real issue got sidelined\\" and that his problem was more with Seed Media Group.Monkey's Uncle , City Pages, September 5, 2007 In addition to articles about keeping religion out of science education, church-state separation, and complaints of misdeeds done in the name of religion, Myers continues to write about science in the disciplines of evolution, Pharyngula: Science: evolution palaeontology, , Pharyngula: science: fossils genetics, , Pharyngula: science: genetics development, , Pharyngula: science: development and molecular biology. , Pharyngula: science: molecular biology In 2012, Myers announced that Chris Clarke, an environmentalist and blogger, would become Pharyngula's co-author. Clarke left the blog in August 2013, partly because of the perceived unpleasantness of Pharyngula commenters. =Book= Myers's book, The Happy Atheist, was published by Random House in August, 2013. It is largely a compilation of previous blog posts.Branch, Glenn (August 8, 2013). \\"Godless chronicles: Glenn Branch goes for a dip in the antitheologic.\\". Nature. Vol 500, p 149.

On June 29, 2008, Cook attended a Catholic Mass being held in the student union at UCF by a Catholic student group that receives funding from the student government. Cook received the Catholic Eucharist host but did not consume it immediately. He said later that he wanted to take it back to his seat to show a friend, but when stopped he pretended to put it in his mouth until back at his seat, then a church leader made forcible attempts to take the wafer from him. Cook stored the host at his home, then returned it one week later after receiving e-mail threats and pleas. Bill Donohue, President of the Catholic League, described the student's actions as \\"beyond hate speech\\" and said that \\"All options should be on the table, including expulsion.\\" In his July 8 blog entry, Myers criticized the reaction to Cook's act. Myers described the level of harassment including multiple death threats leveled against the student, and accusations against the student which included hate crime, kidnapping, and intent to desecrate the Eucharist which Catholics consider a mortal sin. Myers expressed outrage that Fox News Channel appeared to be inciting readers to cause further problems for the student, and ridiculed reports that armed guards would attend the next mass. Myers suggested that if any of his readers could acquire some consecrated Eucharistic hosts for him, he would treat the wafers \\"with profound disrespect and heinous cracker abuse, all photographed and presented here on the web.\\" Myers was criticized from both religious and non-religious quarters. The Catholic League accused Myers of anti-Catholic bigotry, described his proposal as a threat to desecrate what Catholics hold to be the Body of Christ, and sent a letter asking the University of Minnesota and the Minnesota State Legislature to take action against Myers. The Catholic League argued that, as the Pharyngula website was accessible via a link from the University of Minnesota's website, it should be bound by the university's code of conduct, which requires faculty to be \\"respectful, fair and civil\\" when dealing with others. Joe Foley, a member of the Board of the Secular Student Alliance, wrote on the organization's website that Myers had \\"crossed the line\\" from \\"playful satire\\" to \\"masturbatory condescension\\".J. Foley, \\"Wafergate: PZ Myers Crossed the Line\\" , secularstudents.org, Aug. 3, 2008 Foley concluded, \\"if open-minded believers are willing to join us in polite dialogue, we need to be ready to welcome them with more than ridicule and pranks.\\" Subsequently, Myers explained to the Star Tribune that while his post was \\"satire and protest,\\" he had received death threats regarding the incident but was not taking them too seriously. In a talk show featuring Myers on Catholic Radio International, hosted by Jeff Gardner, Myers confirmed that he had been sent an unspecified number of consecrated hosts and said that he intended to \\"subject them to heinous cracker abuse.\\" When asked by Gardner to explain why he must do so, Myers said that Donohue of the Catholic League was insisting that he acknowledge the Body of Christ in the Eucharist. Gardner pointed out that Donohue had no authority to insist on such acknowledgment. The show host then asked Myers which individual possessing the Magisterial authority of the Catholic Church had insisted that he recognize the Body of Christ in the Eucharist. Myers replied that no one from the Catholic Church had contacted him. On July 24, 2008, Myers, in his post, \\"The Great Desecration,\\" wrote that he had pierced through the \\"goddamned cracker\\" with a rusty nail, which he also used to pierce a few ripped-out pages of the Qur'an (in English translation, not the original Arabic) and The God Delusion, and had simply thrown them all in the trash along with old coffee grounds and a banana peel. He provided a photograph of these items in the garbage, and wrote that nothing must be held sacred, encouraging people to question everything. In addition, he described the history of allegations of host desecration, emphasizing the frequent use of such allegations in medieval Europe to justify anti-Semitism. The following day, University of Minnesota, Morris (UMM) Chancellor stated: \\"I believe that behaviors that discriminate against or harass individuals or groups on the basis of their religious beliefs are reprehensible\\" and that the school \\"affirms the freedom of a faculty member to speak or write as a public citizen without institutional discipline or restraint.\\"WALSH, PAUL Morris chancellor defends instructor who defiled Eucharist, tore Qur'an Star Tribune, July 25, 2008 Science activism=Interview and screening of Expelled= In April 2007 Myers was interviewed for what he was told would be a documentary titled Crossroads, purportedly about science and religion. However, in September 2007, executive producer Mark Mathis announced that the film was Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed about perceived censorship of intelligent design supporters in academia and elsewhere. Regarding the discrepancy of focus, Myers wrote: \\"I mean, seriously, not telling one of the sides in a debate about what the subject might be and then leading him around randomly to various topics, with the intent of later editing it down to the parts that just make the points you want, is the video version of quote-mining and is fundamentally dishonest.\\" On March 20, 2008, Myers was denied entry into a screening of Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed at the Mall of America in Minneapolis. He was waiting with his family and guests to attend a private screening after having reserved seats for himself and guests under his own name using the freely available online procedure set up by the film's promoters. Shortly before the film started, a security guard told him that the producer Mark Mathis had instructed that Myers be removed from the premises. After telling his family of this Myers went to a nearby Apple store and blogged about his amusement that they had expelled him, but allowed his guest entry to see the film‚ÄîBritish evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins, who had also been interviewed for the film under similar circumstances. In a question and answer session at the end of the film Dawkins asked why Myers had been excluded, and later said that \\"if anyone had a right to see the film, it was [Myers]. The incompetence, on a public relations level, is beyond belief.\\" The saga has been described by Dawkins as \\"an incredible piece of inept public relations\\" on the part of the film's producers.Discussion on PZ Myers being expelled from Expelled .

Plot summary The title characters, while journeying through a human home, decide to exploit a sugar bowl on their own rather than delivering the sugar cubes to the colony's queen (so each of the ants get one sugar cube and so does the queen ant). They experience misadventures: they land in a cup of coffee, almost get toasted on an English muffin, fall into a sink, get threatened by its garbage disposal unit, and are nearly electrocuted when they enter an electric outlet. Chastened, they rejoin a line of ants carrying sugar cubes back to the colony. Interpretations In Philip Nel's analysis, a conflict between the book's plot and its illustrations leads to artistic tension. While the ants' return to the colony suggests \\"a victory for the bosses\\" and the narrative could be considered a \\"capitalist parable\\", the comparatively huge appliances in the kitchen, which terrify the ants, imply conspicuous consumption. Nel likens the book's resulting ambiguity to the works of Magritte. References * CHILDREN'S BOOKS; FELONS IN THE SUGAR BOWL. Sanford Schwartz, New York Times, November 13, 1988.

He was preceptor of Peshwa Madhavrao (I), when he was a child. He afterwards became Peshwa's domestic priest. Later he was his private treasurer. (Reference : History Book : Tawareekh-E- ShindeShahi) Early life Mahadaji Pant Karkare (Ballal) was born in a Karhade Brahmin family in a village in Ratnagiri district in the Western Maharashtra. He was a scholar of Sanskrit scriptures, Marathi literature and Civics. Family The Karkare Ballal family belongs to Ratnagiri ( Maharashtra). This family is considered very close to the family of Peshwa from the times of Balaji Vishwanath Bhat Ballal (who also was from Ratnagiri). A distant relative, or may be cousin, of Mahadji Pant Karkare was Sakharam Moreshwar Karkare Ballal . Sakharam Moreshwar Karkare Ballal was appointed as chief of the troop of the personal bodyguards of Peshwa Vishwas Rao Balaji during the battle of Panipat - 1761. Records of the Peshwa Office states, that Sakharam Moreshwar Karkare was killed in action while fighting with the troops of Shah Wali Khan of Afghanistan in the south of Ugrakhedi and north of Risalu villages near Panipat. (Tawareekh-E-ShindeShahi) Early career In the Peshwa‚Äôs court in Pune, Mahadaji Pant joined as a clerk and gradually reached at the post of ‚ÄòAuditor General‚Äô. Peshwa Nanasaheb simultaneously appointed him as ‚ÄòGuruji‚Äô that is ‚ÄòTutor‚Äô of his son Madhavrao I who respected Guruji throughout his life . Besides Justice Ramshastri Prabhune, he was the only one who had great influence over Peshwa Madhavrao I. In 1763, when Nana Phadnis was expelled by Madhavrao I for few months, he was re-appointed on the strong recommendation by Guruji. In October 1766, Madhavrao I sought Guruji‚Äôs assistance to give systematic & disciplined shape to the Maratha army on Southern front. Later career and death After the death of Madhavrao I and subsequent murder of Narayanrao, Nana Phadnis re-appointed Guruji to take charge of Peshwa Sawai Madhavrao as his student. The Peshwa had been making his academic progress under the guidance and supervision of Guruji until his death. In 1778, before starting his Kolhapur campaign, the great warrior \\"Shreenath\\" Mahadji Shinde got his demands fulfilled from the Peshwa‚Äôs Court through Mahadjipant Karkare Ballal Guruji‚Äôs arbitration.

Information kiosk commemorating the prison camp is visible in center of picture. Camp Columbia or Columbia Camp was a prison labor camp established on the north shore of the Yakima River opening on February 1, 1944 near Horn Rapids. The camp was operated between February 1944 and October 1947 by Federal Prison Industries to provide labor supporting the Hanford Site. The camp was used to house \\"minimum-custody-type improvable male offenders,\\" who had no more than one year to serve. These were violators of national defense, wartime and military laws. Included were conscientious objectors, violators of rationing and price support laws, those convicted of espionage, sabotage and sedition and those convicted by military courts martial. Aliens who failed to register were also in this category but none of them were sent here because the camp was located on the southern edge of the Hanford Site.http://www.hanfordnews.com/history/fifty/story/396.html Facilities The 25-acre labor camp had a number of Quonset prefab buildings, and barracks to house both prisoners and staff. The camp was built by contractors under contract to the Manhattan District of the Corps of Engineers. Former Civilian Conservation Corps buildings moved from Winifred, Montana were used. Facilities at the camp included five barracks buildings, an office building, a mess hall, a hospital, a recreation hall, storage facilities and a utilities building. Heating was provided by a central steam system. There were no fences around the camp, as the geography itself was a deterrent to escape.Columbia Camp, Prison Camp in our Midst, 1944-1947, Jean Carol Davis, The Courier, East Benton County Historical Society, Volume 15, Number 1, February 1993. Operation as a federal prison labor camp Over the period Camp Columbia was open, it housed a total of 1,300 prisoners. The prisoners were brought in from the prison at McNeil Island Federal Penitentiary, and worked in fruit orchards on land which had been condemned by the Federal government in order to provide buffer space for the nuclear production facility known as the Hanford Site. Over 5,600 tons of fruit were processed and canned for military use. Because of its close proximity to the top secret Hanford project, only prisoners who were American citizens were sent there. As many as 290 prisoners were housed there at any given time. The staff included up to 40 guards under the direction of a warden, Harold E. Taylor, who relocated from McNeil Island. The prisoners were known to occasionally stray down to the river to fish, but only 12 were known to have escaped from the area. Work was not limited to agricultural activities. One of the 1945 actions undertaken by prisoners was demolition of the wartime construction camp near the old Hanford townsite, where nearly 50,000 workers had lived while constructing the reactors and reprocessing facilities at the Hanford site. Post-prison operation After the camp was officially shut down on October 10, 1947, the facility was used to house workers for the Hanford project railroad and other site workers until 1949.

The species in this genus have historically been placed in Oryzomys, but according to cladistic research, they are not more closely related to the type species of Oryzomys than species in some other genera are. Its sister group may be a clade of oryzomyines living in open or aquatic habitats, comprising, among others, Aegialomys, Nectomys and Sigmodontomys. Sooretamys angouya, also formerly in Oryzomys, is another relative; it has been placed in the same group as the species of Cerradomys in the past. The generic name Cerradomys is a compound of the word \\"Cerrado\\" and the Ancient Greek mys \\"mouse\\" and therefore means \\"Cerrado mouse\\". The dorsal pelage is brownish, the ventral pelage, greyish. It has small ears and a relatively long tail. There are crowns of hair on the hindfeet at the bases of the claws. In addition to its external classification, the internal classification of the group is also subject to change. Until 2002, all members of the group were placed in a single species, then called Oryzomys subflavus, but since then, seven new species have been described, often on the basis of karyotypic differences, but two of these later turned out to represent the same species. The genus currently contains the following species: *Cerradomys goytaca *Cerradomys langguthi *Cerradomys maracajuensis *Cerradomys marinhus *Cerradomys scotti (including Oryzomys andersoni) *Cerradomys subflavus *Cerradomys vivoi References *Musser, G.G. and Carleton, M.D. 2005.

Casalini S.r.l. is the oldest microcar producer in the world. The factory is situated in Piacenza. The current range of Casalini microcars have a bodies of reinforced fibre glass plastic. The engine is a 635 cc diesel produced by Mitsubishi, with .  History  The factory produced tricycles and moped bikes up until the late sixties. The first microcar left the factory 1969. The Sulky, which at that time was a three-wheel vehicle, was unusual in its class for having a steel monocoque body. It was mostly made for people without a driving license and had an engine with less than 50 cc (a 49.6 cc Vespa TL3 engine). There was also a 125 cc version. This car was also exported to France, where it was sold by the local Lambretta distributor as the Willam Sulky. A four-wheeled model with a slightly longer body was also developed, for export only. This was called the Willam Bretta and also had 49 or 125 cc engine options; the larger-engined version has rectangular rather than round headlamps. The Sulky/Bretta have rear-wheel-drive and coil springs, the Bretta with wishbone front suspension. The first Sulky was produced in large quantities, exceeding 10,000 units. From 1994, when Italy accepted the European directive 92/61, CASALINI S.r.l. began to produce light quadricycles for sale in Italy as well. The first one of these was the Kore 500. The technical and aesthetic evolution of this vehicle was called Sulkydea (1996), Ydea (2000), Sulkydea LV (2004) and Sulky (2008). Over the past few years, the production of two transport- and leisure time vehicles have been added: Kerry and Pickup. In 2010 the M10 was presented, a four-wheel vehicle also available in a sporty \\"Daytona\\" version. Two other connected companies supply Casalini S.r.l. in the production of Sulky, Kerry and Sulky Pickup: Mech-Plant S.r.l. that deal with metallic composition and Target S.r.l. that deal with plastic/ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) material. Sulky (now M10), Kerry, and Pickup have an extremely strong structure, constituted by a frame in steel treated against corrosion and by a composite material body that secures both an active and a passive safety. Visibility is insured by large glass door surfaces; the presence of four disc brakes and optimum suspensions. The speed limitation of 45 km/h further enhances important safety elements.

Life Feuardent was born at Coutances, Normandy. Having studied humanities at Bayeux, he joined the Friars Minor. After the novitiate, he was sent to Paris to continue his studies, where he received (1576) the degree of Doctor in Theology and taught at the university. He took a leading part in the political and religious troubles in which France was involved at that time. With Jean Boucher and Guillaume Rose, bishop of Senlis, he was one of the foremost preachers in the cause of the Catholic Ligue. As Roennus remarks in an appendix to Feuardent's \\"Theomachia\\", there was not a church in Paris in which he had not preached. Throughout France and beyond the frontiers in Lorraine and Flanders, he was a defender of the Catholic faith. Pierre de l'Etoile, a fierce adversary of the Ligue, recognises in his \\"M√©moires\\" Feuardent's subsequent efforts in pacifying the country. In his old age he retired to the convent of Bayeux, which he restored and furnished with a good library. He died in Paris. Works His works can be grouped in three classes: (1) Scriptural; (2) patristical; (3) controversial. They included: (1) A new edition of the medieval Scripturist, Nicholas of Lyra: \\"Biblia Sacra, cum glossa ordinaria ... et postill√¢ Nicolai Lyrani\\" (Paris, 1590), 6 vols. fol.).

Baechler's early work was noted for childlike imagery and thematics‚Äîassociations which have recurred throughout his career.The Kansas City Star (November 17, 1993) \\"Like Art Brut,\\" wrote Steven Vincent in Art in America, \\"Donald Baechler's seemingly ingenuous depictions of everyday objects and simple figures succeed in large part by tapping into our nostalgia for childhood, that period of life before the rivening onset of self-consciousness and guilt. It's a myth, of course: children are hardly angelic, and alienation is the state of humanity‚Äîwhile Beachler's art works hard to achieve its trademark appearance of prelapsarian sincerity and artlessness.\\"Art in America, September 2005, Steven Vincent Art and Context Baechler's source material draws broadly on classical art history, the New York School, contemporary art, folk art, outsider art, pop culture and childhood.The New York Times, October 13, 2006, Andrea K.

In one drawing several thumbs fill the inside of an outlined head, perhaps giving a clue to the darker undercurrents in Mr. Baechler's work as a whole. Art, like play, he seems to suggest, is just a method for keeping chaos at bay, and these days even the best-behaved child knows he's under somebody's thumb.\\"The New York Times, December 3, 1993, Holland Cotter Playing cars, fortune cookies, a ceramic onion,Elle Decor, June/July 1994, Deborah Eisenberg flowers, ice-cream cones, even a visual play on Mr. Bill of Saturday Night Live, little escapes Baechler's image bank, which is a literal collection. \\"I hold onto absolutely everything,\\" said the artist. \\"I would guess out of every thousand images I save, I probably use one or two. I've never actually counted. I save images in many different forms; I save them in endless file cabinets. I have slide binders with thousands and thousands of slides that I work from. But most of the things I photograph never find their way into a painting; and most of the things I save and catalog and photocopy never really find their way into a work. It's necessary to accumulate all of these things to get to the point of what's important.\\" Widely regarded as a painter, Baechler's three-dimensional work has been correlated to the sculptural works of Roy Lichtenstein, Alex Katz and Carroll Dunham. Baechler has long experimented with a variety of forms and materials, always maintaining what has been dubbed his \\"gee-whiz approach.\\" Alex Hawgood, in a 2008 profile in The New York Times, summarized: \\"Baechler ... is known for his sunny, multimedia work that explores the language of cultural symbols.\\"The New York Times, August 14, 2008, Alex Hawgood But Baechler's \\"animated, engaging and ... beautifully made\\"The New York Times, Roberta Smith images are not without sentiment. \\"Baechler,\\" wrote Edward Leffingwell of Art in America, \\"scatters his surfaces with the detritus of childhood, portraying the adult today through the images of a past not quite left behind.\\" And neither is Baechler outside the purview of art history. The New York Times art critic Holland Cotter remarked of Baechler: \\"At this very moment, some industrious doctoral student somewhere is documenting how thoroughly images of childhood have pervaded art of the late 1980s and early 90s. The images aren't chiefly those of adolescence, as was the case with Pop Art in the 60s, but of infancy.\\" The restaurant Caravaggio on the Upper East Side of Manhattan exhibits two paintings and a sculpture by Baechler.

It was established in 1920 to refine gold within South Africa which until that time had been refined in London.  History  It was established in 1920 in Germiston, South Africa, by the Chamber of Mines of South Africa to refine all the gold produced by South Africa's gold mines instead of in London. As of 1919, the Bank of England would receive consignments of raw gold from the producers and issue it to individual refineries, refined and then returned to the Bank for sale, and the hope was that after the Rand Refinery was built, the gold industry would still be financed in London and that the refined gold would be sold in the latter. On 27 November 1920, Rand Refinery Ltd was registered as a private company, the capital raised from shares of gold mining companies that were members of the Chamber of Mines. Building of the facilities commenced in August 1920. Low quality ingots would be received from the gold mines and then refined to 99.6% purity and then sold to the South African Reserve Bank for sale around the world on the London and Zurich bullion markets. By 1922, the supply of gold to London was almost nonexistent and impacted the two major UK refiners, Johnson Matthey and Rothschild.  Products  In recent years, Rand Refinery has evolved from a pure refiner of dor√© to a more rounded company with an emphasis on beneficiation. It facilitates a wide range of value-added products including: * cast bars * minted bars * minted coins * coin blanks and medallions * semi-fabricated products for the jewellery manufacturing industry By law the South African Mint Company is the only company allowed to manufacture South African legal tender coins such as the world famous Krugerrand. All the gold used to manufacture the coins is supplied by Rand Refinery, who has been appointed the sole supplier of bullion Krugerrands to primary distributors both locally and internationally. In addition to its smelting and refining services Rand Refinery offers metallurgical, logistics and vault services. It acts as an agent for its precious metal depositing customers and its global markets business unit markets all the precious metal produced by the refinery.

There are two methods for staged combustion: air staged supply and fuel staged supply. Applications of staged combustion include boilers http://www.praxair.com/praxair.nsf/AllContent/CD232FC669F0D02885256EDF006BDE37/$File/P-8872.pdf and rocket engines. Air staged supply Air staging, or two-stage combustion, is generally described as the introduction of over-fire air into a boiler or furnace. Staging the air in the burner (internal air staging) is generally a design feature of low NOx burners. Furnace over-fire air (OFA) technology requires the introduction of combustion air to then be separated into primary and secondary flow sections. This achieves complete burnout and encourages the formation of nitrogen gas (N2) rather than NOx. Primary air (70-90%) is mixed with the fuel, producing a relatively low temperature, oxygen-deficient, fuel-rich zone, leading to only moderate amounts of NOx being formed. The secondary (10-30%) combustion air is injected above the combustion zone through a special wind-box with air-introducing ports and/or nozzles, which are mounted above the burners. Combustion is completed at this increased flame volume. Hence, the relatively low-temperature secondary stage limits the production of thermal NOx. The location of the injection ports and the mixing of over-fire air is critical to maintaining efficient combustion. Retrofitting over-fire air on an existing boiler involves water-wall tube modifications to create the ports for the secondary air nozzles and the addition of ducts, dampers, and the wind-box. This technique is currently used in 116 pulverized coal-fired units on a total capacity of 50 gigawatt electrical (GWe) as a standalone measure. It is used in combination with other primary measures for NOx control in 175 coal-fired units on a total capacity of 53 GWe. Via air staged supply, a NOx reduction rate from 50-75% is possible. Air staged supply also leverages a simple configuration and is applicable in small-scale combustion. Fuel staged supply One form of fuel staged combustion is the procedure known as burner out of service (BOOS). The technique involves shutting off the fuel flow from one burner or more to create fuel-rich and fuel-lean zones, achieving some NOx emission control (10%). The technique is not widely used in pulverized coal-fired plants (2 units, 350 MWe). Another method of fuel staged combustion is fuel biasing. In fuel biasing, combustion is staged by diverting fuel from the upper-level burners to the lower ones or from the center to the side burners. The aim is to create a fuel-rich lower or central zone and a fuel-lean upper or side zone in order to achieve complete burnout. The technology lowers the flame temperature and improves the balance of the oxygen concentration in the furnace. NOx emissions may be reduced by up to 30% using this technology. This technique is used in 13 pulverized coal-fired units on a total capacity of 2.7 GWe. Via fuel staged supply, a NOx reduction rate from 50-75% is also possible, though minor temperature instabilities at the reduction zone can occur and a lower temperature is necessary. While applicable in large-scale combustion, fuel staged combustion uses a more complex constructive configuration. History Staged combustion dates back to the hot bulb engine of the 1890s. The first stage of combustion occurred inside a hot bulb, where the hot gases were forced out into the cylinder. Then, when mixed with additional air, the second stage of combustion took place. During those times, staged combustion was used because it was a convenient method of ignition, and, likely, there was not much concern about air pollution. A modern application of the principle is the Stratified charge engine, in which a spark ignites a rich mixture and the resulting flame-front ignites the weaker mixture elsewhere in the cylinder.

It was released in January 1975 on Arista Records.Columnist (February 8, 1975). \\"The New Record Company\\". Billboard: 61. Retrieved on 2011-04-10. Recording sessions for the album took place in the summer of 1974 at D&B; Sound in Silver Spring, Maryland. It was the follow-up to Scott- Heron's and Jackson's critically acclaimed collaboration effort Winter in America. The First Minute of a New Day was the first album to feature \\"Winter in America\\", the title track of Scott-Heron's previous album which was not featured on its original LP release. The album was reissued on compact disc by Scott-Heron's label Rumal-Gia Records in 1998. Music and lyrics The First Minute of a New Day served as Jackson's and Scott-Heron's debut for the Arista label and featured the eight-piece Midnight Band. With the Midnight Band and better financial support from Arista, the album benefited from a larger supporting cast and slicker production, in contrast to the sparse production on Winter in America. The Midnight Band would later be featured on following Scott-Heron albums, assisting in production and back-up instrumentation. The songs on The First Minute of a New Day, which feature themes ranging from spirituality (\\"Offering\\") to revolution (\\"The Liberation Song\\") and oppression (\\"Winter in America\\"), contain jazz melodies by the Midnight Band and funk influences. \\"Winter in America\\" featured themes of struggle and had Scott- Heron singing of social, geographical and environmental oppression. The album's only spoken word cut, also a live take, \\"Pardon Our Analysis\\" was a sequel to Winter in America's \\"H20 Gate Blues\\" as a criticism of President Richard Nixon's pardon, though this time the track did not feature a musical backing of any kind. Reception Following the little commercial success experienced by Scott-Heron's previous LPs, the album had multi-chart success, which seemed promising for their new record label. Even though Scott-Heron's previous albums, in specific Pieces of a Man and Winter in America, featured singles, they did not chart. However, no singles were released for The First Minute of a New Day, off the album or for promotion. Following heavy promotion by Arista, the album entered the Top Jazz Albums chart at #17 on February 8, 1975. It later peaked at #5 before falling off the charts on July 19, 1975, 24 weeks after its original appearance. The First Minute of a New Day also peaked at #8 on the Black Albums chart and #30 on the Pop Albums chart. While not as critically acclaimed as Jackson's and Scott-Heron's previous effort Winter in America, The First Minute of a New Day gave Scott-Heron wider recognition among fans and critics, due in part to its heavy promotion. Tim Sheridan of Allmusic called it \\"solid, decidedly left-of-center jazz-R&B;\\" and went on to write: Music critic Neil Tesser described Scott-Heron's singing voice for the album as \\"mahogany, sunshine, and tears.\\" The contributions by the Midnight Band were also praised by critics. Robert Christgau of the Village Voice noted that \\"the free-jazz-gone-populist band generates so much rhythmic energy that it carries over the weak spots\\".

Glasgow, 18 March 1941 A parachute mine is a naval mine dropped from an aircraft by parachute. They were mostly used in the Second World War by the Luftwaffe and initially by the Royal Air Force (RAF) Bomber Command. Frequently, they were dropped on land targets. History=Luftwaffe= During the Second World War, the Luftwaffe used a number of different kinds of parachute mine. The Luftmine A (LMA) and Luftmine B (LMB) weighed and respectively. The LMA was in length and the LMB . After the parachute opened, the mine would descend at around . If it came down on land, a clockwork mechanism would detonate the mine 25 seconds after impact. If the mine landed in water it would sink to the bottom. If the depth was greater than , water pressure and the dissolving of a water‚Äìsoluble plug would deactivate the clockwork time-detonator, and activate an anti-shipping detonator. These were initially magnetic detonators but later, acoustic or magnetic/acoustic detonators could be fitted. The Luftwaffe began dropping mines in British waters in November 1939, using Heinkel He 115 seaplanes and Heinkel He 111 land‚Äìbased bombers. The new British cruiser, HMS Belfast, was damaged by a parachute mine on 21 November in the Firth of Forth, while the destroyer HMS Gipsy was damaged at Harwich on the same night. The threat to shipping posed by magnetic detonators was effectively negated after a German parachute mine was captured intact when it landed in mud in the Thames Estuary. Thereafter, a ship's magnetic field could be counteracted by a process called degaussing. This involved either the installation of electric wires around the inside of the hull, or for smaller vessels, by passing an electric cable under the hull, known as \\"wiping\\". Parachute mines were first used against land targets on 16 September 1940 in the early stages of the Blitz. It was rumoured that Hermann G√∂ring had ordered parachute mines to be dropped on London in a fit of temper, but it is more likely that they were originally intended to disrupt shipping in the London Docks. From October 1940, mines were also dropped in raids on other British cities such as Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester and Coventry. Clearance of these was carried out by the Royal Navy, which quickly dispatched a team to London from HMS Vernon, while Army Bomb disposal staff were warned that it was extremely inadvisable to attempt to render them safe without Naval guidance. The official British designation for these weapons on land was \\"Parachute Landmines\\", but civilians just called them \\"land mines\\". The singer Al Bowlly was killed by a parachute mine which exploded outside his flat in Jermyn Street, London during the Blitz on 17 April 1941. The use of standard parachute mines declined after 1941, but the Luftwaffe later used the Bombenmine (BM 1000, Monika, or G Mine). This was fitted with a tail made from Bakelite which broke up on impact.

It is performed by Rusty, a young, naive Steam Locomotive and the Starlight Express, a magical Steam Locomotive that comes at midnight to help Steam Locomotives in need. Rusty, who wants to compete in the world championship railway races, has lost self belief because Greaseball and Electra have been taunting him, and his coach, Pearl has dumped him for faster locomotives. In this number, the Starlight Express, sent by Rusty's father, Poppa, has come to tell Rusty that true power comes from within.  Music  The music was composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber, and is in the key of E major. It is a highly thematic number, starting with Rusty alone. The tune to Rusty's number, Starlight Express plays. Then, as the Starlight Express, joins, he sings the tune of Only You, a theme not yet heard at this point. He gives Rusty his message through the verse. Rusty then comes back with the Starlight Express theme, to say he doesn't understand. The Starlight Express continues the theme Rusty is singing to explain. Rusty, realising what he is being told, joins the Starlight in the Only You theme, later used by Pearl when she realises that she loves Rusty. Lyrics Lyrics are by Richard Stilgoe. The original title for the number was 'I am the Starlight'. Choreography/Blocking=Broadway/London= It starts with Rusty, sat alone, centre stage. He would call out the words 'Starlight Express', and he would stand, as the Starlight came to stand behind him. The Starlight Express would be played by the actor who played Poppa, and so he would come on in that costume. Rusty, however, would never turn to see him, and would always be looking up, perhaps based on the idea of a Shoulder Angel. When they both sang the 'Only You' theme, Rusty would go onto his knees, and the Starlight take his hands and raises them above him. The Starlight skates away, leaving Rusty feeling powerful. Bochum It starts with Rusty, sat alone, centre stage. He would call out the words 'Starlight Express'. The Starlight Express, again played by the actor who played Poppa, would not come on, but speak from offstage. When they both sang the 'Only You' theme, Rusty stands and raises his hands above him. He would pick up his helmet at the end. US/UK tours It starts with Rusty, sat alone, centre stage. He would call out the words 'Starlight Express'. The Starlight Express, would sing as an OV, rather than appearing onstage. This time, however, Rusty can see the Starlight, rather than the audience, and looks directly above them, to a light shining down on him, with 'stars' shining all around. When they both sing the 'Only You' theme, Rusty is lifted into the air amongst the stars, coming down to pick up his helmet at the end.

He gained his greatest fame as a coach, taking his teams to five league, three league cup titles and two McGuire Cup titles In 1956, he coached the US Olympic soccer team at the 1956 Summer Olympics. He is a member of the National Soccer Hall of Fame. Player Born in Dundee, Mills moved first to Paisley then to Bridgeton, Glasgow as a young boy. He began his career with St. Clemens in the Churches League. In 1909, he began playing in the Scottish Junior Football Association with Shettleston F.C., Vale of Clyde F.C. and Kirkintilloch Rob Roy. He then moved to Bathgate F.C. when he was seventeen. He also spent time with Clyde F.C. before transferring to Canada in 1920 where he joined the Toronto Caledonians of the National League. In 1923, he moved to the United States, but does not show up on a professional roster until the 1924‚Äì1925 season when he played twenty-two games for the Philadelphia Field Club of the American Soccer League. He saw time in only four games at the start of the 1925-1926 season before moving to Fairhill F.C. of the Allied League of Philadelphia. Mills would continue to play for Fairhill until 1935. Coach When Mills joined Fairhill F.C. in 1925, he became the team's coach as well as a player. Over the next sixty years, Mills forged a legendary coaching reputation as he led multiple teams at the collegiate, amateur, professional and national levels. While Mills continued to coach and play for Fairhill until 1953, he also became a college coach when he replaced David Gould as the head coach at the University of Pennsylvania in 1938. He spent only one season at Penn before becoming the head coach of the boys' team at The Episcopal Academy. He coached the boys for the next twelve years. In 1942, Fairhill F.C. purchased the professional Philadelphia Nationals of the American Soccer League and elevated Mills to head coach. A traditionally poorly performing team, the Nationals suffered under several poor seasons before Mills slowly built them into the league's dominant team. Beginning in 1948, Mills' led the Nationals to a string of league (1949, 1950, 1951 and 1953 ) and Lewis Cup (1949, 1951 and 1952) titles. In 1953, Brookhattan hired Mills. He spent two seasons with the team before returning to Philadelphia in 1956 when Uhrik Truckers hired Mills. He promptly took them to the league championship. By that time, Mills had established himself at the collegiate level. His year at Penn and his work at the Episcopal Academy brought him to the attention of Haverford College which hired him in 1949. He remained in that position until 1970, coaching every season except 1956 when he headed the US Olympic soccer team. Mills compiled a 126‚Äì94‚Äì21 record in his twenty seasons with Haverford which continues to host an annual Jimmy Mills Soccer Tournament. During many of his years with Haverford, Mills held practice only after working all day repairing looms at a Philadelphia carpet mill.Soccer at Haverford: More Than a Game In 1974, he became an assistant coach at Girard College before moving up to the head coach position in 1981. In 1983, a heart attack ended his coaching career at the age of 88. Mills also spent twenty years as the coach of the Lighthouse Boys Club, taking the team to twenty consecutive city championships as well as the 1957 and 1967 US U-19 championships (McGuire Cup). =Olympic team= In 1956, Mills coached the US Olympic soccer team at the 1956 Summer Olympics.

Plot Traude Krueger (Bleibtreu) is working as a piano teacher in a women's prison. While selecting new students, she meets Jenny Von Loeben (Herzsprung). When she tells her she can't take any lessons because her hands are too rough and she is uncooperative, Jenny becomes enraged and almost kills the prison guard, M√ºtze (Pippig), also one of Krueger's students. Then she starts playing the piano. Krueger listens from the hallway and, impressed by her talent, later offers Jenny lessons, but requires absolute obedience, including eating a sheet of paper. She tells Jenny never to play \\"that kind of negro-music\\" again. Jenny's adoptive father wanted to turn her into a Mozart-like child prodigy when she was young, but when she resisted going to further contests, he raped her. Krueger plans to have her compete again. While practicing, some inmates become jealous of Jenny, who doesn't seem to get punished for beating up the guard. Some of the prison personnel oppose giving her the freedom to play the piano. However, the prison director wants positive media attention for his prison. Jenny reaches the finals of a piano competition for players of 21 and under. M√ºtze transfers her to the cell of her rival inmates. They strap her hands to the bed with some cloth and set them on fire. Jenny severely wounds one of the culprits, and she is forbidden to enter the competition. Krueger learns that M√ºtze deliberately set up the conflict and she confronts him. Krueger resigns, and takes her piano. M√ºtze helps Jenny escape from prison with the piano so she can play at the competition. Jenny learns that Krueger has had contact with her adoptive father. Thinking he arranged all of it and that Krueger was just being bribed into teaching her, she rages violently. Krueger tells her about her own past, how she lost her great love, another woman, during the second world war, because she was a communist, and how she also taught her to play the piano. Krueger convinces Jenny to play at the competition, where, because the police have come to take her back to prison, she has only four minutes to win the support of the crowd. She deviates from the original plan of playing a piece by Schumann and plays a unique piece of her beloved \\"negro-music\\", including percussion, foot-stomping and reaching under the lid to pound the strings. When she is finished, the crowd erupts in a standing ovation.

His ecclesiastical career started very early with his selection as Bishop of Montefiascone e Corneto, nowadays Diocese of Viterbo, Acquapendente, Bagnoregio, Montefiascone, Tuscania e San Martino al Monte Cimino on 12 November 1528 when he was not quite ten years of age. He resigned on 4 June 1548. He was created a cardinal deacon in the consistory of 18 December 1534 by Pope Paul III with the Deaconry of Santi Vito, Modesto e Crescenzia. Later he was appointed Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church on 22 October 1537, a position he held until his death. He was opted for the Deaconry of Santa Maria in Cosmedin on 31 May 1540, for the Deaconry of Sant'Eustachio on 10 December 1540 and finally for the Deaconry of Santa Maria in Via Lata on 9 March 1552. He participated in the two papal conclaves of 1555 (the one in April which elected Marcellus II and that in May which chose Paul IV) as well as the conclave held in December 1559, which resulted in the election of Pius IV who re-convoked the Council of Trent. Guido Ascanio Sforza died on 6 October 1564 of fever in Mantua. His body was transferred to Rome and buried in his family's chapel in the patriarchal Liberian basilica.

Plot J.P. Tannen (Voight) is a former professional golfer residing in California. He is estranged from his three children, who live in New York with their mother Kathleen (Millie Perkins) and stepfather, attorney Mitchell (Crenna). In an effort to re-enter their lives, Tannen decides to take them on a Mediterranean cruise. Tannen, who still has feelings for Kathleen, wants her to believe he's a changed man, but she's not convinced. On the cruise, Tannen is distracted by the prospect of picking up women, including French archaeologist Marie (Marie-Christine Barrault), often leaving the kids to fend for themselves for entertainment. He reserves a table for five in the dining room, secretly expecting to find an adult female companion for the fifth chair. Youngest son Truman-Paul (Robby Kiger) has a learning disability, which Tannen impatiently pushes him to overcome. Adopted oldest son Trung (Son Hoang Bui) is caught stealing food from the ship's galley and trying to order drinks with a phony ID. Their sister Tilde (Roxana Zal) is a sensible and sensitive girl, but much too young to act as a parental influence to the boys. Tannen begins to feel he can't function as a traditional father, so he suggests that the kids think of him as a \\"friend,\\" even calling him \\"J.P.\\" The trip temporarily gets back on track with the ship's first port-of-call, Rome. The family has fun together and Marie is impressed by what she witnesses of Tannen as a caring parent. But while en route to their next stop, Athens, Tannen receives devastating news. Kathleen has been killed in a car accident in New York while taking the family dog to the vet. Grief-stricken, he is met in Athens by the children's stepfather, Mitchell, who explains that he went ahead and buried Kathleen, then flew to Europe to escort the children home, where a memorial service would later be held. Tannen insists on telling the kids himself, demanding more time. Mitchell tries to talk him out of this, but ultimately agrees to leave the kids with their father for a while longer. The ship moves on to Cairo. With the kids sightseeing, Tannen meets with Mitchell again in a local tavern, to tell him that he has begun to consider pursuing full custody of the children. Their conversation escalates into a profanity-laced argument. Mitchell points out what an absentee parent Tannen has been, not even knowing the names of his children's friends or teachers. He hints at knowledge of Tannen's unsuccessful business dealings and vows to use his capacity as a lawyer to ruin him. Tannen confesses to Marie the truth about how little time he actually has given his kids over the years. Marie joins the family on a trip to the Pyramids. It is there that Tannen finally breaks down and informs the kids that their mother has died. The children are devastated. At the next stop, Tunis, Trung runs away. He takes the first launch to shore, with the intention to work his way back to the U.S. Tilde tells her father that Trung has a history of running away, yet another fact he didn't know. They discover him in a marketplace and catch up to him after a chase. Tannen forces the boy to open up to him, whereupon Trung tells him angrily that he needs Tannen as a father, not a \\"friend.\\" Mitchell is waiting in Genoa, prepared to take the kids back to the United States and their home. As gently as he knows how, Tannen informs Mitchell that he is keeping them. He then rattles off a list of the kids' friends and teachers, showing Mitchell that he is determined to be more in tune with their lives. Cast *Jon Voight as J. P.

The film involves a British scientist who is attempting to create a device that turns base materials into gold. He later forces the German scientist's assistant Werner Holk (Hans Albers), who was working on a similar experiment, to come to his underwater nuclear reactor to help him. Gold was made in both German- language and French-language versions with Brigitte Helm reprising her role in both. Plot A German scientist has discovered a theoretical means of transforming lead into gold. Working with his engineer Werner Holk (Hans Albers), he is literally moments from proving his theory when the lab is blown up by a saboteur. Holk is then hired by the British capitalist who ordered the sabotage and goes to Scotland to see his friend's work recreated on a massive scale in a secret laboratory beneath the North Sea. Swearing revenge, he agrees to help the millionaire and even fraudulently \\"creates\\" a bit of gold to fortify the illusion that the machine works. Gaining the confidence of the millionaire's somewhat wayward daughter Florence (Brigitte Helm) as well as the workers, Holk puts together a plan to destroy the machine before the artificial gold it would create can wreak havoc on the world economy. The first day of the machine's operation, Holk manages to turn the workers against the millionaire (thus ensuring they'll all get away safely), then only barely escapes himself before the lab is blown up in a spectacular sequence of explosions and strobe lighting. Production Director Karl Hartl developed Gold after the international success of his previous science fiction film Der Tunnel.Hull, 1969. p.56 Gold was the studio Universum Film AG's superproduction of that time and reportedly took 14 months to shoot.Hull, 1969. p.57 Actor Hans Albers sued the production asking for nearly double his salary but lost the case. During this production time, a French-language version of the film was also made which kept Brigitte Helm as the lead actress but changed many of the supporting characters roles. L'Or was the French- language version of the film that was shot simultaneously with it. Serge de Polign directed the scenes in French with the scripted adapted to French by Jacques Thierry.

The French-language version was shown on 1 June 1934. When the film was reviewed by the Allied Censorship boards after World War II, the viewers pondered whether German scientists had been able to build a nuclear reactor long before it was originally thought they did. Parts of the stock footage scenes in Gold were later used again in the 1953 American film The Magnetic Monster.

It was the first feature film by director Pip Karmel, and was released and reviewed internationally. Plot Pamela Drury is single and works as a serious journalist. She spends her birthday alone and becomes lonely and reflects upon her life and the choices she made and secretly wishes she had gotten married and had children. In a box of photos of old boyfriends, she reflects upon why she broke up with one in particular, Robert Dickson, 13 years earlier. She also meets an interesting man, Ben and follows him home, only to see through his window that he is with his family and looks very happy. Shortly afterwards, she is hit by a car while crossing the street. The woman who was driving the car is also Pamela, but is Pamela Dickson; she is from an alternate universe in which she married Robert 13 years earlier. Pamela Dickson takes Pamela Drury to the Dickson family home and the two of them talk in the kitchen. Suddenly, Pamela Dickson's kids come home and she disappears, leaving the unmarried Pamela Drury in a house she has never seen before with three children she does not know. The children assume she is their mother, although they do not quite recognize her sometimes. She soon finds out that her alternate version Pamela Dickson lives in a dull marriage and writes lightweight fluff articles for a mainstream ladies magazine, rather than being the serious reporter that Drury is. She meets Ben again, but in this time-line he was never married and still mourns the loss of the great love of his life, who was killed just before their graduation from college. At first, Pamela Drury was pleased to be with Robert again after all these years apart, but she is soon unhappy and annoyed with married life, and quarrels with Robert. She embarks on an affair with Ben, not mentioning to him that she has a husband and kids (because she still doesn't think of herself as married or a mother). Ben visits her and learns the truth, and walks away angry and disappointed. Soon, Pamela Drury embraces having a family and falls for Robert again, and even stimulates him and enlivens her marriage. Then when Pamela Drury is in a restaurant bathroom, Pamela Dickson shows up again, and the two women switch back to their former lives. Pamela Dickson had been living the life of single Pamela Drury and enjoyed it but ultimately missed her husband and kids so she came back. Pamela Drury is single once more and embraces her life with a new appreciation of all that being single and having a career has to offer. She learns that while she was gone, Pamela Dickson began dating Ben, who actually is divorced from the woman she saw through the window, the same woman who alternate-Ben had thought was his soul mate. Ultimately she sees that both lives are appealing and offer a lot to appreciate.

Species diversity and vegetation structure across various strata in natural and plantation forests in Katerniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary, North India. Tropical Ecology 50(1): 191‚Äì200. The Katerniaghat Forest provides strategic connectivity between tiger habitats of Dudhwa and Kishanpur in India and the Bardia National Park in Nepal. Its fragile Terai ecosystem comprises a mosaic of sal and teak forests, lush grasslands, numerous swamps and wetlands. It is home to a number of endangered species including gharial, tiger, rhino, Gangetic dolphin, swamp deer, hispid hare, Bengal florican, the white-backed and long-billed vultures. One of the best places in the world for seeing the gharial in its natural habitat is the Girwa River, where it is found sympatric with the mugger. The population of gharials in this stretch was one of the three that were still breeding, when the project to conserve this reptile from the verge of extinction was initiated in 1975. However, between the years of 2001 and 2005, almost all the gharial nests were raided by tribals who consider them a delicacy. Mugger crocodiles are also seen in small number in the Girwa river,as their favorite haunts are stagnant wetlands like the many taals and baghars that dot the sanctuary. Side by side the serenely swimming gharial can be seen frolicking Ganges dolphins. Recent discoveries in herpetofauna of Katerniaghat are highly fascinating and are represented by several species such as the banded krait, the Burmese rock python, the yellow speckled wolf-snake and the paradise flying snake. In 2012, a rare red coral kukri snake was sighted in the sanctuary. This snake with the scientific name Oligodon kheriensis was first described from the North Kheri Division in 1936.Green, M. (2010).

Murray in A History of Board-Games Other Than Chess (1952). The game is related to Draughts and even more so to Alquerque. Pieces are captured by leaping over them. Egara-Guti consists of a Lau kata kati board, but with the addition of two lines connecting the two triangles and running through them. Egara-guti belongs to a specific category of games called Indian War-games, and the other games in this category are Lau kata kati, Dash-guti, Pretwa, Gol-skuish. All Indian War-games have one important thing in common, and that is that all the pieces are laid out on the grid patterned board in the beginning, with only one vacant point in the center. This forces the first move to be played on the central point, and captured by the other player's piece.  Setup  The board consist of two triangles connected together at a common vertex. Players play on opposite sides of the board with the base of each triangle forming the first rank of each player. Two lines cross the breadth of each triangle forming the second and third ranks respectively of each player. The common vertex is the fourth rank of each player, and is also the central point of the board. A single line perpendicular to the base of each triangle runs through the common vertex. Two more lines connect the two triangles where the second ranks intersect with their respective triangles and extend all the way to each triangle's base. There are a total of 23 intersection points. Pieces are situated on the intersection points, and move along the lines. Each player has 11 pieces. One plays the black pieces, and the other plays the white pieces, however any two colors or distinguishable objects will do. Players choose which color to play, and who starts first. The 11 black pieces are initially placed on the intersection points of one of the triangles, and the 11 white pieces are placed on the intersection points of the other triangle. The only intersection point vacant is the central point of the board. Intersection points hereforth will be referred to as \\"points\\".  Rules  *Players alternate their turns using one piece to either move or capture exclusively per turn. *A piece moves one space per turn onto a vacant adjacent point along a line. *Captures are compulsory and are done by the short leap as in draughts and Alquerque, where the adjacent enemy piece is leaped over onto a vacant point adjacently behind. The captures must be done in a straight line following the pattern on the board. A piece must continue to capture if it is able to. Captured pieces are removed immediately from the board. *If a player captures all of their opponent's pieces, he or she is the winner. *If a player cannot perform a move or a capture because its pieces have been blocked or immobilized by the other player's pieces, this is known as a stalemate, and the player loses; the other player wins. *If neither player can capture any more pieces, the player with most pieces wins. If both players have the same number of pieces, then the game is a draw.

He began his career as a forward but switched to play in the defence. Playing career Born in Medicine Hat, Alberta, Garbutt began his career in 2001 at junior level in the WHL playing for the Brandon Wheat Kings. In his debut season for the Wheat Kings, Garbutt featured in 52 regular season games, scoring 19 points and totalling 33 penalty minutes. This helped the Wheat Kings into the post-season where they lost in the Eastern Conference final. Garbutt continued with the Wheat Kings, and continued to be an important player for the organisation, who again managed to get to the Eastern Conference final but again were eliminated. Garbutt featured in 17 post-season games during the 2002‚Äì03 season. In his final season in Brandon, Garbutt played in 38 games before moving mid-season to the Kamloops Blazers. Garbutt again played in the WHL post-season, although the Blazers were eliminated quickly in the Conference quarter final. Garbutt started the following season with the Prince George Cougars, but moved after just 12 games to the Yorkton Terriers of the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League. In 40 SJHL games, Garbutt totalled an impressive 38 points. Garbutt has twice attended NHL development camps, for the Washington Capitals and the Anaheim Ducks but has not been drafted. Garbutt's senior career began though a call-up by the Victoria Salmon Kings to the ECHL, generally regarded as the third tier of ice hockey in North America. Garbutt featured in just 7 games though before playing for the University of Regina in Saskatchewan at CIS level. While in the CIS, Garbutt managed an impressive point-per-game ratio. Garbutt split the 2006‚Äì07 season between the New Mexico Scorpions and the Tulsa Oilers, both of whom play in the Central Hockey League. He continued with the Oilers for the 2007‚Äì08 season, but after 27 games and 15 points moved to the Rio Grande Valley Killer Bees. Garbutt featured in 29 games, scoring 11 points and totalling 18 penalty minutes. In the summer of 2008, Garbutt moved to play for the Manchester Phoenix of the EIHL for his first taste of European hockey. Garbutt firmly established himself as a cornerstone of the Phoenix defence during his season in Manchester, and also managed to total 45 points in just 66 games, an impressive total for a defenceman. Garbutt's play helped the Phoenix to both domestic cup finals as well as into the post-season. Despite on-ice success, financial problems befell the organisation and in the summer of 2009, the Phoenix announced they would operate in the EPL. As a direct consequence, much of the senior squad was released, including Garbutt. In his time away from the hockey rink, Garbutt helps out on the family farm and works as a buffalo rancher.

He played club rugby predominantly for Newport, captaining the side twice and played county rugby for Monmouthshire. He also represented the British Isles in Australia, and after retiring from playing became an international referee. He fought in both World Wars, became a president of the Welsh Rugby Union, was a Justice of the Peace, businessman and High Sheriff of Monmouthshire. Club career Vile took part in a trial for Newport in 1900 at the age of 17 and despite his slight build was chosen as a forward. Due to injuries to other players, Vile got his chance and was accepted into the Newport ranks and in 1902 made his first-class debut for the club. During the 1903/04 season he became the club's regular scrum-half. Vile was a master of the reverse pass and was also a strong kicker who scored many drop goals for his club. In 1909 he was made captain of Newport and showed himself as a great offensive tactician; and in the 1911/12 season lead his team to the Club Championship. In 1912, Vile alongside team partner Walter Martin were impressive in the match against the touring South Africans, which saw Newport win 9‚Äì3. International career=Wales= Vile made his debut for Wales against England in 1908, mainly due to injuries to the Swansea pairing of Dicky Owen and Dick Jones.Thomas (1979), pg49 Vile was reportedly very nervous before the match as fog had descended and reduced visibility to 50 yards; and Vile presumed the game would be abandoned, allowing Owen time to recover and regain his place. Although Vile played well, when Owen and Jones were fit they were the first choice pairing for the Welsh selectors, and it wasn't until Owen declined to play in 1912 that Vile got a regular place in the Welsh squad. After a terrible display against England in 1913 Vile was dropped by the selectors, but, surprisingly, was reselected after the First World War to captain Wales against Scotland in 1921 at the age of 37.Thomas (1979), pg50 =British Isles= In 1904 Vile was chosen to tour AustralasiaSmith (1980), pg 148. under the captaincy of Bedell-Sivright.

In total he would referee 12 internationals between 1923 and 1931.WRU Welsh International Role of Honour Military service In World War II, Vile was a lieutenant in the Royal Artillery and during World War II reached the rank of major serving in the Intelligence Corps.

The David Citadel Hotel (, ') is a luxury hotel in the center of Jerusalem, Israel. The hotel is on King David Street, close to the entrance to the Old City. The hotel hosts VIPs, including global political leaders, business moguls and celebrities, competing with the nearby King David Hotel and the new Waldorf Astoria for the title of \\"Jerusalem's flagship hotel\\". Description The hotel was designed by Moshe Safdie as a U-shaped structure rising 10 stories high with 384 rooms and suites. It has terrace-style suites that overlook the Old City and the Tower of David, and a glass-domed public lobby in the inner part of the \\"U\\". The building is an integral part of the Mamilla development project planned by Safdie, and highlights a neo-Oriental style which blends Middle-Eastern and classic Jerusalem architectural elements. History The hotel is owned by the Tel Aviv-based Alrov hotel and real estate development group, under the tutelage of Israeli business mogul Alfred Akirov. It opened in 1998 as the \\"Hilton Jerusalem\\" as it was managed by Hilton International, which was supposed to bring the property international notoriety. However, after a business dispute between Alfred Akirov and Hilton International, which developed into multimillion-dollar mutual lawsuits between the two corporations Hilton pulled out of managing the property in 2001. The owners decided that the hotel would not engage another international chain to manage the property and it was renamed The David Citadel Hotel. Today the hotel is managed by the Alrov Hotel Group. The Alrov Hotel Group owns five luxury properties in Jerusalem, Amsterdam, London and Paris. People who have stayed include then-U.S. President Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary Clinton, as well as Senator Barack Obama, Senator John McCain, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who has used the facility to conduct quiet meetings between Israeli and Palestinian peace negotiating teams.

Freiburg im Breisgau: Herdersche Verlagshandlung, p. 8. died in the convent at Wagh√§usel, 10 September 1712) was a German Capuchin theologian, preacher, and ascetic writer. Life He came from a Catholic family, and while still young entered the novitiate of the Capuchins. After his ordination to the priesthood, he was assigned to a professorship of theology. In 1666, he was involved in the care of plague victims, and began to compose short popular religious treatises. Martin then made a specialty of popular preaching and religious writing in the Archdiocese of Trier and Archdiocese of Ingelheim. He continued up to the time of his death, hearing confessions with the aid of an ear-trumpet. Works The most voluminous is an ecclesiastical history in 2 vols, fol., composed for apologetic purposes and provoked by the attacks made upon the Catholic Church by Protestantism. However, the author brought it down only to the year 1100. Father Martin's other works embrace a great variety of subjects: the life of Christ, legends of the saints, edifying narratives, the setting forth of certain points in Christian asceticism, forms of prayer, methods to be followed for the worthy reception of the sacraments, etc. The best known is \\"Die heilige Messe\\", on which, according to his own statement, he spent three years.

History  The lands originally were home to a far older property, Bryn-y-caerau. In 1559, St Albans lawyer Alban Stepney married into the family of Richard Davies, Bishop of St David's. On 31 December 1561 the bishop appointed him receiver-general of the diocese of St David's, and he also served as its registrar. From this point he and his descendants built up the Welsh branch of the Stepney family, and their associated estate.R. Harrison, Some Notices of the Stepneys (1870) Part of the original Stepney estate which surrounded Llanelli, by the early 1800s the property and its immediate lands had been purchased by Mr R. T. Howell, a local business man, Harbour Commissioner and member of the local Health Board. After his death in 1853, the property passed through his will to James Buckley Wilson, the son of architect James Wilson, and grandson of the Revd James Buckley. Based in Bath, Somerset he had no need for such a grand house, but he agreed a 99-year lease to his cousin James Buckley (1838‚Äì95). Under the terms of the lease, Buckley commissioned his cousin to design a new large scale addition to the house. However, still wanting more space and to express his money and influence, Buckley recommissioned his cousin in 1882 to undertake a more extensive reconstruction to create the present Italiante style mock- castle in Bath stone, known on opening in 1886 as Brynycaerau Castle. Originally orientated south-west, Buckley-Wilson reorientated the entrance to the south-east to over look the earlier structures grounds, and the surrounding countryside towards the River Loughor estuary, and onwards towards the sea. He added a central three arched porte coch√®re (carriage porch) to accommodate the new drive, and the two small symmetrical supporting side extensions have projecting bays. All except the rear elevation are symmetrical, achieved by extending the northwest wing and reconfiguring the out buildings; on all the corners the quoins stand proud. There are square headed windows on the ground floor, and arched windows above. The house is topped by a low pitched slate roof to give a castle-like feel on approach, behind parapets with balustrades and urn finials. There is also a tall belvedere tower rising at the rear. Remodelling the gardens, behind the house sat a kitchen garden with pergola and associated small orchard, with access to glasshouses, stables and coachhouse beyond (now converted to council offices and storage). The lodge that was to the south-east of the house has now been demolished. Buckley-Wilson was so proud of the finished structure, that it formed part of his application to be admitted as a fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects. In 1911, after the deaths of both James Buckley and James Buckley-Wilson, Llanelli Urban Council were looking to secure Parc Howard for development as a civic park and museum. However, the property was in need of extensive renovation and modernisation, and the council budget could not stretch financially to both purchase and renovation. After Sir Arthur Cowell-Stepney had died in 1909 in Yuma, Arizona, his daughter Katherine Meriel Cowell-Stepney inherited the Stepney estate. In 1911 she became the second wife of the noted Liberal politician Sir Stafford Howard and in January 1912 they offered to fully fund the purchase of the property for ¬£7,750. In February 1912, the parties agreed a 999-year lease, on the conditions that: #The estate to be laid out by a competent gardener as a people's park #The house to be converted into a local museum or otherwise used for the benefit or enjoyment of the public #The whole to be kept in order in order for the purpose to which it is devoted #No intoxicating liquor to be sold on any part of the house or councils grounds #The rent to be ¬£5 per annum and the work to be completed (so) that the park can be opened to the public on 21 September 1912 These were scoped to allow the property to be opened on the couple's first anniversary, and secondly that Sir Stafford had a belief that local authorities were inclined to be somewhat slow, and this was a way of enforcing progress. As the 1912 Miners' strike was in progress by March, cheap labour was extensively available to complete the project in time at a budget of ¬£4,500. As agreed the park was opened on 21 September 1912 by Lady Howard on her first wedding anniversary, and included a bandstand and tennis courts. During the 1930s, the Council acquired of additional land to the north-east, extending today to where Parc Howard Avenue lies. A new entrance was made from Felin Foel Road, and the perimeter path suitably extended. During both World War I and World War II, the property was used as a hospital for wounded soldiers. In 1915 the mansion was converted into a hospital for wounded soldiers, with 40 soldiers occupying five wards, and being attended to by 18 Red Cross nurses. The hospital remained in operation post the end of hostilities until 1921, when it was let to the War Pensions Committee for a further three years to allow for disabled rehabilitation. In 1965, Llanelli Borough Council bought the house and of surrounding grounds from the Stepney estate for ¬£350,000. Present The site on Felinfoel Road (A476) is now managed by Carmarthenshire County Council. To the front is a small grassed terrace, while to north-east the informal lawn covers . There is a pond to the south of the lawn, and a sunken garden to its west. To the west of the house are the bowling greens and tennis courts, with an adjacent children's play area. On the western side of the site, a Gorsedd Circle marks the area where druids celebrate the Gorsedd ceremony to mark the National Eisteddfod, which was held in Llanelli in 1962. The park is open every day of the year (except Christmas Day), from 7.30 am until half an hour before dusk. Collection and exhibits Parc Howard Museum and Art Gallery is best known for its large and representative collection of the locally-made Llanelly Pottery (1839‚Äì1920), gifted in 1933 by Lady Howard. It also houses paintings, portraits and other art works and displays artefacts relating to the local area, its history and culture.

Murray in A History of Board-Games Other Than Chess (1952). The game is related to draughts and Alquerque as pieces are captured by leaping over them. The board is composed of three concentric circles divided by three diameters. Pretwa belongs to a category of games called Indian war games, which also includes the games Lau kata kati, Dash-guti, Egara-guti, Gol-skuish. All Indian war games have one important thing in common, and that is that all the pieces are laid out on the board at every intersection point, with the exception of the central point. This forces the first move to be played on the central point, and captured by the other player's piece. Pretwa is a smaller version of the game Gol-skuish. Setup The board consist of three concentric circles divided by three diameters that are equally spaced apart from one another (see diagram). This produces 19 intersection points (hereforth called \\"points\\"). The intersection of the three diameters forms the central point of the board. Pieces are situated on the points, and move and capture along the lines of the board. Each player has 9 pieces . One plays the black pieces, and the other plays the white pieces, however any two colors or distinguishable objects will do. Players choose which color to play, and who starts first. As indicated by the diagram, each player initially places their 9 pieces on three consecutive radiuses leaving the central point vacant. Rules *Players alternate their turns using one piece to either move or capture exclusively per turn. *A piece moves one space per turn onto a vacant adjacent point along a line. *Captures are compulsory and are done by the short leap as in draughts and Alquerque. A player's piece leaps over an adjacent enemy piece and lands onto a vacant point adjacently behind. A capture of an enemy piece must be completed exclusively along a concentric circle, or along a diameter. A piece must continue to capture if it is able to do so, and can switch from capturing along a concentric line to a diameter and vice versa. Captured pieces are removed from the board immediately. *If a player captures all of their opponent's pieces or at least reduces their numbers to three, he or she is the winner. *If a player cannot perform a move or a capture because its pieces have been blocked or immobilized by the other player's pieces, this is known as a stalemate, and the player loses; the other player wins. *If neither player can capture anymore pieces, the player with more pieces wins. If both players have the same number of pieces, then the game is a draw.

Plot A group of widely divergent characters meet up with a broken-down touring concert-party, throw in their lot with them, and eventually triumph after temporary setbacks. This British musical-comedy follows an unlikely trio as they try to revive the fortunes of the floundering theatrical troupe. School teacher Inigo Jolifant (John Gielgud) with his talent for songwriting, and recently unemployed Jess Oakroyd (Edmund Gwenn) with his theatrical ambitions, together persuade Miss Trant (Mary Glynne), an older single woman looking for adventure, to fund them as they attempt to bring \\"The Dinky Doos\\" back into the spotlight.

It is one of those stories which is all the more worth while for having been made in England, for, aside from the naturalness of the players, there are the scenes of country houses and hedged roads, which add to the general effect of the picture\\";https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F0CE5D91530EF3ABC4852DFB6678388629EDE whereas Time Out wrote, \\"Saville's direction is adequate rather than inspired, but he elicits marvellous performances from his disparate cast. Matthews' portrayal of a bubblingly neurotic soubrette is wonderful, and not surprisingly shot her to stardom. The film does feed on rather than explore the twee camaraderie of the provincial touring company, but an English backstage musical as witty and well-handled as this is something to be thankful for indeed\\"; and Leonard Maltin called it \\"a delightful film. Matthews is given full rein to display her considerable musical and comedic charms; Gielgud is equally humorous and surprising. He even sings!\\" ReferencesExternal links 1933 films 1933 comedy films British films British comedy films English- language films British black-and-white films Films directed by Victor Saville Films with screenplays by Ian Dalrymple Films based on British novels Films based on works by J.

Murray in A History of Board-Games Other Than Chess (1952). The game belongs to the draughts and Alquerque family as pieces are captured by leaping over them. The board is composed of seven concentric circles divided by three diameters. Gol-skuish belongs to a specific category of games called Indian War-games which include Lau kata kati, Dash-guti, Egara-guti, and Pretwa. At the beginning of every Indian War- game all the pieces are laid out on the board at every intersection point, with the exception of the central point. This forces the first move of the game to be played on the central point, and captured by the second player's piece. Gol-skuish is a larger version of the game Pretwa. Setup The board consist of seven concentric circles divided by three diameters which are equally spaced apart from one another (see diagram). This produces 43 intersection points (hereforth called \\"points\\"). The three diameters intersect to form the central point of the board. Pieces are situated on the points, and move and capture along the lines of the board. Each player has 21 pieces. One plays the black pieces, and the other plays the white pieces, however any two colors or distinguishable objects will do. Players choose which color to play, and who starts first. As indicated by the diagram, each player initially places their 21 pieces on three consecutive radiuses leaving the central point vacant. Rules *Players alternate their turns using one piece to either move or capture exclusively per turn. *A piece moves one space per turn onto a vacant adjacent point along a line. *Captures are compulsory and are done by the short leap as in draughts and Alquerque. A player's piece leaps over an adjacent enemy piece and lands onto a vacant point adjacently behind. A capture of an enemy piece must be completed exclusively along a concentric circle, or along a diametrical line. A piece must continue to capture if it is able to do so, and can switch from capturing along a concentric line to a diameter and vice versa. Captured pieces are removed from the board immediately. *If a player captures all of their opponent's pieces or at least reduces their numbers to five, he or she is the winner. *If a player cannot perform a move or a capture because its pieces have been blocked or immobilized by the other player's pieces, this is known as a stalemate, and the player loses; the other player wins. *If neither player can capture any more pieces, then the player with more pieces wins. If both players have the same number of pieces, then the game is a draw.

He signed for Hibernian on 29 July 2008, and made his Scottish Premier League debut in the 1‚Äì0 defeat at Kilmarnock in early August. Thicot had to be substituted after just 33 minutes due to a thigh injury that kept him out of action for \\"weeks\\". He returned to the team in a 2‚Äì1 win at Aberdeen, but was again substituted. Thicot became a regular under Mixu Paatelainen, but the Finnish manager left Hibs at the end of the 2008‚Äì09 season.

The flight was interrupted on the Hong Kong leg by an exploding oxygen tank that ruptured the fuselage just forward of the starboard wing root. The plane made an emergency descent to a breathable altitude of about 10,000 feet and diverted to Ninoy Aquino International Airport, Metro Manila, Philippines. There were no injuries. In-flight accident VH-OJK, the aircraft involved in December 2007 The flight left Hong Kong on 25 July 2008 shortly after 9:00 am HKT (0100 UTC). At 10:17 HKT (0217 UTC), passengers and crew heard a loud bang; the cabin depressurised and a hole in the floor of the passenger deck appeared, as well as a hole in the outside wall of the cargo deck. During the emergency, parts of the aircraft's floor and ceiling collapsed. Passengers reported that, despite the noise and the deployment of the oxygen masks, there was very little panic. The pilots conducted an emergency descent from 29,000 feet to ensure adequate oxygen supply for the passengers, reaching 10,000 feet by 10:24 HKT (02:24 UTC). After the accident, four passengers said that their oxygen masks did not deploy, whilst others had deteriorated elastic.ATSB final report, p.53 It was stated that these passengers were deprived of oxygen until the plane had descended to a breathable altitude. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau interviewed passengers who reported problems with the oxygen masks as part of their investigation. The hole in the fuselage ‚Äì roughly in an inverted T-shape ‚Äì was up to 2.01 m wide and approximately 1.52 m high, located on the right side of the fuselage, below cabin floor level and immediately forward of the wing. The wing-fuselage fairing was missing, revealing some palletised cargo in the hold. However, the freight forwarder reported that all items on the manifest were accounted for. Other than some items which were located near the cylinder and resulting hole, no other cargo or baggage on the flight was damaged. There were no injuries. ATSB final report, page 3 A few passengers reportedly displayed signs of nausea upon exiting the aircraft. Investigation The Australian Transport Safety Bureau led the investigation, sending four investigators to Manila to conduct a detailed inspection of the aircraft, with Qantas, Federal Aviation Administration, Boeing, the Australian Civil Aviation Safety Authority and the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines also involved. Soon after the accident, the ATSB announced that air safety investigators found that an oxygen cylinder which was located in the area of the explosion had not been accounted for, but that it was too early to say that an oxygen cylinder could be the cause of the mid-air explosion on QF30. Regardless, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority ordered Qantas to inspect all of its oxygen cylinders and brackets which hold the cylinders on its Boeing 747 fleet. The valve and mounting brackets were found, but not the bottle, number four of thirteen fitted in that bank. A senior investigator, Neville Blyth, reported that the cylinder valve was found inside the cabin, having punched a hole \\"at least twenty centimetres in diameter\\" through the cabin floor. Blyth said that the flight recorders were to be analysed in the Canberra laboratories of the ATSB. However, because the plane had remained airborne and operational throughout the incident, the cockpit voice recorder does not contain records of the initial event itself; its two-hour memory had been overwritten with recordings taking place after this event, during the diversion and landing. The twenty- four-hour flight data recorder does contain data covering the entire incident. On 29 August, the ATSB gave an update confirming further aspects of the initial investigation. They stated that these initial investigations had found that the aircraft took about five and a half minutes to descend from the decompression event at 29,000 feet to the altitude of 10,000 feet and that it appeared that part of an oxygen cylinder and its valve had entered the passenger cabin, then impacted with the number 2 right door handle, turning it part way. The ATSB noted that there was no risk of the door being opened by this movement, with the door systems performing as designed. All three of the aircraft's instrument landing systems as well as the anti-skid braking system were unavailable for the landing; the pilots subsequently landed the aircraft without using those systems. Most of the oxygen masks deployed in the incident, with 426 out of the 476 deployed being activated by the 346 passengers, pulling them down to activate the flow of oxygen. =Preliminary findings= The cause of the accident has been determined to be an exploding oxygen tank in the cargo area, according to a preliminary finding of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau: > \\"After clearing the baggage and cargo from the forward aircraft hold, it was > evident that one passenger oxygen cylinder (number-4 from a bank of seven > cylinders along the right side of the cargo hold) had sustained a sudden > failure and forceful discharge of its pressurised contents into the aircraft > hold, rupturing the fuselage in the vicinity of the wing-fuselage leading > edge fairing. The cylinder had been propelled upward by the force of the > discharge, puncturing the cabin floor and entering the cabin adjacent to the > second main cabin door. The cylinder had subsequently impacted the door > frame, door handle and overhead panelling, before falling to the cabin floor > and exiting the aircraft through the ruptured fuselage.\\" =Other safety concerns= Oxygen masks that were deployed after the blast failed to function properly. Some passengers were forced to share a mask when the Qantas Boeing 747 ran into trouble, while others panicked when they failed to open. The FAA had recently issued airworthiness directives regarding problems with the masks on this and several other Boeing commercial aircraft models. The ATSB issued two Safety Advisory Notices, advising responsible organisations to review procedures, equipment, techniques and personnel qualifications for maintenance, inspection and handling of aviation oxygen cylinders.AO-2008-053-SAN-006 ATSB, 29 August 2008AO-2008-053-SAN-007 ATSB, 29 August 2008 =ATSB final report= Just over two years after the incident, the final report of the event was released on 22 November 2010. From the summary released by the ATSB: > \\"On 25 July 2008, a Boeing Company 747-438 aircraft carrying 369 passengers > and crew rapidly depressurised following the forceful rupture of one of the > aircraft's emergency oxygen cylinders in the forward cargo hold.

It was ferried to Avalon on 10 November 2008. The original captain and first officer were part of the ferry crew. The only work that remained to be done at that point was replacement of the carpets and seat covers. On 18 November 2008, with all work complete, the aircraft was damaged again when another Qantas Boeing 747 collided with it at Avalon. The aircraft was eventually returned to service on 15 January 2009 but retired from service at the end of 2009 and sold to Nigerian carrier Max Air in 2011, re-registered as 5N-HMB. The aircraft was then operated for a further six years before being stored at Victorville. Qantas still uses the flight number 30, as a non-stop Hong Kong- Melbourne route, dropping its London origin. IFALPA In early 2010, the International Federation of Air Line Pilots' Associations awarded the Polaris Award to Captain John Bartels and his flight crew.

A series of nine bombs exploded in which one person was killed and 20 injured.8 blasts rock Bangalore According to the Bangalore City Police, the blasts were caused by low-intensity crude bombs triggered by timers. India already suffered from a similar series of blasts in Jaipur, in May 2008. The Times of India has reported that either the banned organisation Students Islamic Movement of India or the militant organisation Lashkar-e-Toiba could be behind these blasts. The Intelligence Bureau is not ruling out the involvement of these organisations, however the police maintain that it is too early to attribute blame to anyone. The bombings were followed by the 2008 Ahmedabad bombings one day later.  The bombings  It was initially reported that three blasts took place at around 1:30 pm IST.IBNLive.com. 25 July 2008. 2:55 pm IST.IBN Live Later reports indicated that four low-intensity blasts occurred: One at Nayandahalli (1:30 PM IST), two in Madiwala (at 1:50 pm IST), and the last in Adugodi (2:10 pm). Other blasts were reported from areas including the Mallya hospital, Langford Road and Richmond Circle. The Madiwala blast took place at a check post, behind The Forum, a popular shopping mall in Bangalore. It has been reported that gelatin sticks were used in the bombs. Police indicated that all bombs had timer devices attached to them and that mobile phones were used to trigger the bombs. The blasts were low-intensity but occurred in crowded areas. * 1st blast: 1.20 pm, Madiwala bus depot * 2nd blast: 1.25 pm, Mysore road * 3rd blast: 1.40 pm, Adugodi * 4th blast: 2.10 pm, Koramangala * 5th blast: 2.25 pm, Vittal Mallya road * 6th blast: 2.35 pm, Langford Town * 7th blast: Richmond Town There was another bomb found on 26 July 2008 in Bangalore near Forum Mall, Koramangala which was defused successfully by the Bomb Detection Squad.Another bomb found in Bangalore, defused-India-The Times of India  Casualties  One person was killed and 20 injured in the attacks. The confirmed dead was a woman waiting at a bus shelter in Madiwala on the Hosur road; her husband and another person were seriously injured. The injured were admitted to the St. Johns Hospital. In response to the attack Prime Minister Singh sanctioned an ex gratia payment of Rs one lakh to the relatives of those dead and Rs 50,000 to those injured in the blasts.  Reactions  President Pratibha Patil, the Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, Leader of the opposition L. K. Advani, Vice-President Hamid Ansari, Chief Minister of Karnataka, B. S.

NDTV. 25 July 2008. Malls, schools and cinema halls across the city were shut down, and the police cordoned off the blast sites. The effect of the blast on the Sensex was immediately visible with losses exceeding 3.5% reported on Friday after the Bangalore blasts. The 30-share BSE index was down 3.7%, or 529.28 points at 14,228.81, with 23 components in the red. The 50-issue NSE index was down 2.9 percent at 4,305.30. The government has issued a statement that IT companies in Bangalore were not the target of the blast. This was reaffirmed when major IT companies based in the city -like Wipro and Infosys- reported that the blasts had no impact on their operations and that all employees were safe. Employees were, however, urged to leave for home early. A new security plan for IT and other industries was announced by Minister for Home Affairs Shivraj Patil immediately after the Bangalore serial blasts. Under the new amendment of law Central Industrial Security Force personnel could be used to safeguard private sector industries which till now was limited to public sector undertakings (PSUs).  Investigation  No one has claimed responsibility for the bombings. The Bangalore Police Commissioner, Shankar Bidari, termed the blasts \\"an act of miscreants\\" trying to disturb peace in the city. The Union Home Ministry of India named the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Toiba and Students Islamic Movement of India, as the suspects. The Bangalore Police said that attack \\"bore some hallmarks\\" of the Bangladesh-based militant group Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami (HuJI).Seven small blasts hit Indian IT city of Bangalore. Reuters. The Central Government of India had warned the Karnataka state government one day earlier that state was high on the terror hitlist along with six other Indian states ‚Äì Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab, and Assam ‚Äì and Union Territory Delhi. There is a possible connection with the Andhra and Varanasi attacks. An official was quoted as saying \\"The aim of these groups, whether HuJI or LeT or Simi, is clear. Bangalore and Hyderabad are being chosen as targets to create panic in the US as the cities house [the] biggest IT companies from the US.\\" The Andhra ‚Äì Karnataka link involves Raziuddin Nasir, a Hyderabad resident, and his aide Hafiz Khan Adnan from Bangalore, were arrested near Hubli in Karnataka this year. Furthermore, another clear link between the terror elements in both blasts is the explosive material used. In the Bangalore blasts an explosive with an ammonium nitrate base was used, while in the Gokul Chat and Lumbini Park explosions in Hyderabad a similar ammonium nitrate base was used. These were also of low intensity with the aim of creating panic. Like the Malegaon and Mecca Masjid blasts, it took place on a Friday during or just after the prayers. In response to these blasts security was also beefed up in Andhra Pradesh. It was also reported that sleeper cells have gained a firm foothold in Karnataka with the discovery of terror camps in the Karnataka forest early in the year. In this vein, near- simultaneous blasts ‚Äì all having the footprint of the jehadi network that had carried out blasts in Varanasi, Jaipur, Mumbai and elsewhere ‚Äì point to the strong foothold terrorists have made in the city.Sleeper cells gain foothold in Bangalore-India-The Times of India On 29 July, the Bangalore police Anti Terrorism Squad (ATS) arrested a SIMI activist named Sameer Sadiq in connection with the blasts. According to the police, Sadiq had played a key role in the Surat riots. He was staying at Gurapanapalya in Bangalore, the area which incidentally housed the SIMI office before it had been banned. On 30 July 2008, the Intelligence Bureau (IB) indicated that two men ‚Äì Rasool Khan Parti and Mohammad Sufiya Ahmed Patangiya ‚Äì currently living at Farahan Arcade Gulistan in Karachi were the masterminds behind the Ahmedabad and the Bangalore serial blasts. They used to reside in Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh. Both are possibly members of Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami. The Gujarat Police has been looking for them in connection to the murder of former Gujarat state minister Haren Pandya. On 5 February 2009, Karnataka Police arrested Muhammed Zakaria, then 19 years old, under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. He was accused of making timers for the blasts. Two witnesses have retracted their testimony alleging that the police made them witnesses and the case is fabricated. In March 2020, Zakariya's mother, Biyumma filed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) in the Supreme Court seeking to declare the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), as unconstitutional. Advocate Hashir K Muhammed created a documentary about Zakariya in 2017 titled 'A Documentary about disappearance.'

Articulated variant (St√ºtztender)  The first C IIs were built experimentally as articulated locomotives. The concept was based on an idea that had been developed by Wilhelm von Engerth (c.f. the Engerth locomotive), whereby the boiler barrel was supported by the tender - sometimes called a St√ºtztender or 'supported tender'. Because the engines did not ride smoothly however, they were converted in 1870. Initially the St√ºtztender was removed and, in order to balance out the uneven weight distribution on the axles, the first axle was uncoupled, so that the locomotives had a 1B axle arrangement. When, after a few years, the boiler had to be replaced, it was positioned further forward to enable a better distribution of weight. As a result, the former articulated locomotives were then the same as the standard C II locomotives and became six-coupled again.. A total of five were built by Maffei. They were named: HERCULES, HECTOR, ACHILLES, AJAX and THESEUS.  Standard variant  The C II locomotives were needed to handle the growth in goods traffic. The standard variant of the C II series was built as an 0-6-0 engine with a 4-wheeled tender. It was derived from the Class CI.1 and was given an external locomotive frame, horizontal outside cylinders, an internal Stephenson valve gear and a 'long-necked crank' (Langhalskurbel). The transition from boiler barrel to outer firebox had been tapered so that it could fit between the rear axle. Instead of a driver's cab, these locos were given a weather shield (Wetterschirm), similar to those on present-day motorbikes. Their retirement began in 1891 and was complete by the end of the 1920s. Several examples went as wartime reparations to France and Belgium. They were equipped with a Bavarian 2 T 9,25 tender.

Other than Latin or French corruptions of the name Vile there is no real evidence of the surname in Britain prior to the 17th century. At the end of the 17th century there is a lot of evidence of an influx of people named Vile in areas of Somerset, South Wales, London and indeed to the US and other British colonies including India. France in 1685 decided to throw out their Protestant \\"Huguenots\\", some 500,000 people were effected. It is well known that the \\"Norse\\" population of southern Europe favored the Protestant teaching of Luther and Calvin this would have branded them for expulsion. In Somerset the influx of Huguenot immigrants named Vile coincides with the dreadful events of 1685 and the Monmouth uprising. The subsequent murder and enslavement of hundreds if not thousands of Somerset men under the order of James the 2nd, John Churchill and Judge Jeffreys. Samuel Vile was hung drawn and quartered as a result of these dreadful actions in Frome Somerset during September 1685. The Monmouth uprising caused Somerset to be deprived of a generation of breadwinners they desperately needed to replace them and the Huguenots were welcomed with open arms.

It is dedicated to preserving and displaying items related to the life and times of Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim, a Finnish statesman and military officer. The Mannerheim Museum is located on top of a hill in a prestigious residential area next to the Kaivopuisto park in Helsinki. The building was the home of Mannerheim from 1924 to 1951. With the exception of a few rooms that have been converted for exhibition purposes, his home has been preserved in its original state.  History of the building  The building was originally constructed in 1874 and became known as the Boman Villa, after its first owner. It was the home of Mannerheim from 1924 until his death in 1951, although he never actually owned it, but rented it from the industrialist Karl Fazer. Prior to his tenancy it had been divided into six separate flats for workers in Fazer's chocolate factory, and Mannerheim had to have major alterations made before he could move in. He attached great importance to his home, which is reflected in the interiors, which he had designed himself right down to the colour schemes and the positioning of the furniture. After Mannerheim's death in 1951 the Mannerheim Foundation continued to rent the house from the Fazer family. In 1957 the house was purchased by the foundation and converted into a museum.  Exhibits  The museum is a mixture of original furnishing of the building from the early 1940s, and additional material brought in to illustrate the life of Mannerheim and the historical context of the period. Among the notable exhibits is an extensive collection of medals and other honours which Mannerheim received from numerous countries. Also displayed are his numerous hunting trophies, book collection, gifts and portraits of his ancestors. Mannerheim's bedroom, which is kept at its original state, displays the spartan conditions in which he preferred to sleep. The museum also maintains an extensive archive of photographs. The museum receives approximately 10,000 visitors a year. The entrance fee also includes a guided tour, and it is not possible to visit the museum without a guide. This is because the rooms are actually fairly small, and packed with delicate exhibits. The tours are available in Finnish, Swedish, English, German, French, Russian and Spanish.

The stupa was built in the 18th century by Lama Ngawang Lodr√∂, the nephew of Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal in order to subdue a harmful demon believed to have been living at the site where the chorten is now located. The stupa is modeled after the famous Boudhanath stupa in Nepal popularly known as Jarung Khashor. Chorten Kora took twelve years to construct and was consecrated by Je Yonten Thaye. The demon that had harmed the people of the valley was apparently subdued and banished. Thereafter, it is said that the people of the valley continue to live in peace and harmony. Chorten Kora Festivals There is an annual Dakpa Kora (circumambulation of the Chorten by the Dakpas) festival held on the 15th of the first lunar month, and a Drukpa Kora (circumambulation of the Chorten by the Bhutanese) festival held at the end of the first lunar month which celebrate the stupa. These festivals are attended by Dakpa people of the neighboring Tawang District of Arunachal Pradesh in India, and Bhutanese from Tashiyangtse, Tashigang, and Kurtoe. Chorten Kora A popular belief is that when the stupa was constructed, a pious Dakini princess from neighboring Arunachal Pradesh in India entombed herself within, as the Yeshe Semba, to meditate on behalf of all beings.

The construction cost for the new 160-kilometre railway was calculated to be 30 billion SEK in 2012.

It was originally planned for speeds up to . In 2018, the Swedish Transport Administration decided that the line instead would be designed for speeds up to 250 km/h, citing reduced costs (by 11 billion SEK, from 65 billion to 54 billion). However, this requires 1‚Äì2 years of adjusting the original plans.

The terminal for passenger ferries to Tallinn, Estonia, remains in L√§nsisatama (literally West Harbour in Finnish). History The Ruoholahti Canal, with J√§tk√§saari on the right hand side What is now known as J√§tk√§saari (literally Docker Island in Finnish), was originally a group of four islands: J√§tk√§saari (Busholm), Hietasaari (Sandholm), Saukko (Uttern) and tiny Saukonkari. The sea between the islands and the continent was filled, creating a peninsula to house harbour facilities. The area became an island once more with the construction of the Ruoholahti Canal. With most of the harbour operations having moved to the new Vuosaari Harbour, the construction of a new mixed-use city district began in late 2009, after a clean-up of contaminated soil was completed.

Temporary exhibitions can bring together objects that might be dispersed among several collections, to reconstruct an original context such as an artist‚Äôs career or a patron's collection, or to propose connections - perhaps the result of recent research - which give new insights or a different way of understanding items in museum collections. The whole exhibition, usually with associated services, including insurance, shipping, storage, conservation, mounting, set up, etc., can then be loaned to one or more venues to lengthen the life of the exhibition and to allow the widest possible audiences - regionally, nationally or internationally - to experience these objects and the stories they contain. Such collaborations can add interest to museums where displays of permanent collections might change only slowly, helping to provide fresh interpretations or more complete stories and attract new audiences. They also provide fresh ideas and breathing space for organisations which have exhibition spaces but lack permanent collections. To have more than one location for the same exhibition can benefit the organiser because it can then share a part of the production costs among the venues, so museums and galleries frequently use touring as a cost-efficient way of promoting access to their collections. For organisers and their venues, touring exhibitions are important for sharing ideas (for example, promoting techniques for providing for visitors with visual impairments or producing displays which examine current or topical issues) and materials (especially objects that might not be seen in public frequently or even shown together), as well as resources (human as well as financial). Touring is a way of sharing with like-minded institutions and of achieving economies of scale which allow more ambitious projects to happen. Travelling exhibitions are often supported by governmental organizations to promote access to knowledge and materials that might not be available locally. To acknowledge the importance of travelling exhibitions, in 1983 the International Council of Museums (ICOM) established the International Committee for Exhibition Exchange (ICEE) as a forum to discuss the different aspects of exhibition development, circulation and exchange.

It establishes Australia as a constitutional monarchy, its form as a federal government, and sets out its relations with the State Governments. Authority to interpret the Constitution resides in the High Court.Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth), s 30(a) for the High Court and s 39B(1A)(b) for the Federal Court. The Constitution was drafted and approved after discussion and referendums held by members of the British colonies in the late 19th century. Its approved draft was enacted as section 9 of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900, an act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The Act united the six colonies into a single colony. Australia later became an independent nation. The Act was given Royal Assent on 9 July 1900, was proclaimed on 17 September 1900, and entered into force on 1 January 1901. It remains technically in force in the United Kingdom, although without operation there, in its original form. The UK Parliament never amended the Act, and legal recognition of its competence to do so was formally ended by the Australia Act 1986. The Constitution is in force in Australia as amended by Australians. Although the Constitution initially derived its lawful authority from the UK Parliament, the present understanding of the High Court and some academics is that it derives its authority from the Australian people. The Australian Constitution is understood to incorporate various unwritten constitutional conventions and ideas derived from the Westminister system, one of which is responsible government. It is notable for not containing a national bill of rights. Australia is among a tiny minority of democratic nations to not have a formal bill of rights in any form; constitutional or statutory. The Constitution may only be amended by national referendum. Forty four referendums have been held, of which eight have succeeded; most recently in 1977. Ongoing debates exist regarding further proposals for amendment. Some ideas include the inclusion of a preamble, the addition of an Indigenous voice to government, and the prospect of an Australian republic. The Morrison Government announced in late 2019 that a referendum will be held on whether to add a First Nations voice to Parliament. Other documents of constitutional significance to Australia include the Statute of Westminster, and the Australia Act 1986. History= Prior to federation = Political movements to federate the Australian colonies grew to prominence in the mid 19th century. Multiple motivations existed for increased political co-operation between the colonies; including a desire to regulate inter-colonial tariffs. Tensions existed however between the larger colonies and the smaller ones, and in the degree to which each colony embraced protectionist policies. Those tensions and the outbreak of the American Civil War harmed the political case for federalism in the 1850s and 60s. In 1889 the Federal Council of Australasia was established. It arose out of a fear of the growing presence of German and French colonies in the pacific, and a growing Australian identity. The council could legislate on certain subjects but did not have a permanent secretariat, an executive, or independent source of revenue. Perhaps most problematically New South Wales, the largest colony, did not join the body. A series of conferences to discuss federalism was promoted by the Premier of New South Wales Henry Parkes; the first held in 1890 at Melbourne, and another at Sydney in 1891. These conferences were attended by most colonial leaders. By the 1891 conference the federalist cause gained momentum. Discussion turned to what the proper system of federal government ought to be. A draft constitution was drawn up at the conference under the guidance of Sir Samuel Griffith, however, these meetings lacked popular support. An additional problem was that this draft constitution sidestepped some critical issues like tariff policy. The 1891 draft was submitted to colonial parliaments, however it lapsed in New South Wales. After that event other colonies were unwilling to proceed. In 1895, the six premiers of the Australian colonies agreed to establish a new Convention by popular vote. The Convention met over the course of a year from 1897 to 1898. The meetings produced a new draft which contained substantially the same principles of government as the 1891 draft, but with added provisions for responsible government. Some delegates to the 1898 Constitutional Convention favoured a section similar to the Bill of Rights of the United States Constitution, but this was decided against. To ensure popular support, the 1898 draft was presented to the electors of each colony. After one failed attempt, an amended draft was submitted to the electors of each colony except Western Australia. After ratification by the five colonies, the Bill was presented to the British Imperial Parliament with an Address requesting Queen Victoria to enact the Bill. Prior to the bill's enactment a final change after lobbying by the colonial Chief Justices. This change set a right to appeal from the High Court to the Privy Council. After the change, the 'Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act' was passed by the British Parliament in 1900. Western Australia then agreed to join the Commonwealth in order to ensure it would be an 'original state'. The Commonwealth of Australia was then officially established on 1 January 1901. = After federation = At federation Australia was still regarded as a colonial dominion of the British Empire. British Imperial laws were still in force, although according to Robert Menzies 'the real and administrative legislative independence of Australia (was) never challenged' since the creation of the Commonwealth. The formal power of the British Imperial parliament to override Australian legislation was restricted by the UK's 1931 passage of the Statute of Westminster, adopted into Australian law by the Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942. The adoption act acceded Australia to the Statute of Westminister retroactively, with the date set to 3 September 1939, when Australia entered WWII. Photo of the Australia Act 1986 (United Kingdom) document located in Parliament House, Canberra Australia did not arguably achieve full de jure independence from the UK until 1986, with the passage of the Australia Act. That act formally ended the UK parliament's ability to legislate over Australian States, and also abolished all appeals from Australian courts to the Privy Council. Queen Elizabeth II traveled to Australia personally to sign the proclamation into law. In 1988, the original copy of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900 from the Public Record Office in London was lent to Australia for the purposes of the Australian Bicentenary. The Australian government requested permission to keep the copy, and the British Parliament agreed by passing the Australian Constitution (Public Record Copy) Act 1990. The copy was given to the National Archives of Australia. A curiosity of the document's history is that the act remains in force at the UK's parliament in its original form, while in Australia the constitution exists as amended by referendum. Australian High Court judges have discussed in obiter that the constitution's source of lawful authority may no longer reside in the imperial parliament, but may instead now derive its lawful authority from the Australian people. Following the 2017‚Äì18 Australian parliamentary eligibility crisis, there was discussion of whether to retain or replace the current constitution. Former Prime Minister Bob Hawke advocated for getting \\"rid of the constitution we've got\\", and replacing the constitution with a system that does not include states. Commemoration Constitution Day is celebrated on 9 July, the date the Constitution became law in 1900. The date is not a public holiday. Constitution Day was first held on 9 July 2000 to mark the centenary of the Constitution in the lead up to the Centenary of Federation. Further events have not been widely held since 2001. The day was revived in 2007 and is jointly organised by the National Archives and the Department of Immigration and Citizenship.  Document structure & Text  The Constitution as amended = Covering clauses = There exist eight 'covering clauses' as preface to the Imperial Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900. The covering clauses are pro-forma enacting formulae, with no effect on the constitution's legal content. The second covering clause sets out that Australia's monarch is to be the same as in the UK. = Main document = The Constitution is divided into eight chapters, collectively containing 128 sections. The first three chapters state the respective powers of the legislature, executive, and judiciary. This split into three chapters has been interpreted by the High Court as giving rise to a substantive separation of powers doctrine in Australia. Chapter I: The Parliament sets up the legislative branch of government. Its constituent parts are stated to be the Sovereign (represented by the Governor-General), the Senate, and the House of Representatives. It provides for the number of representatives to attend each body, and provides that the representatives attending both must be chosen directly by the electorate. Each electorate of the house of representatives is to be apportioned equally by population, whereas senators are allocated unevenly between 'original states', the territories, and future states (of which none presently exist). The house of representatives is required to have twice as many members as the senate. Chapter 1 also provides for the monarchy. While the incumbent monarch is Queen Elizabeth II,The effect of Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900, section (covering clause) 2. her legal capacity as queen of Australia is separate to her capacities as monarch to other nations.R v Foreign Secretary; Ex parte Indian Association [1982] QB 892 at 928; approved by the High Court of Australia in . The chapter notably also provides for the powers of the Commonwealth parliament. The parliament is not granted plenary power by the constitution. Section 51 contains a list of enumerated topics that the Commonwealth parliament is permitted to legislate upon. States may also legislate upon these topics, but Commonwealth law prevails in the event of collision between the laws. Section 52 contains a brief list of topics that only the Commonwealth may legislate upon. Other matters dealt within the chapter include eligibility issues for voting or standing in elections; and miscellaneous matters regarding parliamentary procedures and allowances. Chapter II: The Executive Government sets up the executive branch. Executive powers are stated to be exercised by the Governor- General on the advice of the Federal Executive Council. The Governor-General is stated to be the commander in chief, with power to appoint and dismiss persons within the executive, as well as the power to dissolve parliament. These powers of the governor general are often referred to as reserve powers, and by constitutional convention are only exercised on the advice of the Prime Minister in cabinet. On a federal level the reserve powers of the governor general have only been exercised absent the advice of the prime minister one time; when the Whitlam government was controversially dismissed by John Kerr. Australia's military is also provisioned for within this chapter, with section 68 stating that command of Australia's naval and military forces is to be vested in the Governor-General. the High Court as Australia's apex court Chapter III: The Judicature sets up the judicial branch. Commonwealth judicial power is vested in a federal supreme court to be called the High Court of Australia. The parliament is authorized to create federal courts, and to vest the exercise of federal judicial power within the courts of the states. Section 74 (now defunct) provides for the circumstances in which an appeal may be made to the Queen in Council, s75 provides for the High Court's jurisdiction, and s80 guarantees trial by jury for indictable offences against the Commonwealth. Chapter IV: Finance and Trade deals commercial matters within the federation. s81 prescribes all Commonwealth revenue to a Consolidated Revenue Fund, and s90 gives the Commonwealth exclusive power over custom and excise duties. Section 92 is notable for prescribing 'absolutely free' trade and commerce between the States. Section 96 allows the Commonwealth to make grants on terms determined by Parliament. s101 is notable for setting up the defunct Inter-State Commission. Chapter V: The States contains provisions dealing with the States and their role in the federal system. Sections 106-108 preserve the powers of the States, 109 gives Commonwealth legislation supreme force over that of State governments to the extent of inconsistencies. Section 111 provides for surrender of state territory to the Commonwealth, s114 forbids States from raising military forces, and also forbids inter-government taxation of government property. Section 116 forbids religious tests for office, and the establishment of a national religion. Chapter IV: New States allows for the establishment or admission of new states, and allows parliament to provide for representation of the territories. It also provides that state boundaries must require the consent of a state before alteration by referendum. Chapter VII: Miscellaneous contains provisions on varied topics. Section 125 establishes Melbourne as the nation's temporary capital, while providing for the eventual capital to be established within New South Wales but no less than from Sydney. In 1911 New South Wales ceded to the Commonwealth what is now the Australian Capital Territory. Canberra, built within it, was declared the national capital in 1913. Section 126 permits the Governor-General to appoint deputies Section 127 provided that \\"aboriginal natives\\" were not to be included in headcounts for electoral purposes. That section was removed by referendum in 1967. Chapter VIII: Alteration of the Constitution is a single section providing for amendments. It prescribes that alterations may only occur through a referendum bill being approved at a national referendum. A national referendum under this section requires a 'double majority' to be valid, which consists of a majority return of electors nationally, and a majority return in a majority of states. =Schedule= The constitution also contains a schedule setting out the wording of the oath and affirmation of allegiance.Constitution (Cth) Schedule 1 Oath. By convention, the Governor-General and members of parliament are required to swear an oath or affirmation of allegiance before taking office. The oath reads: By convention the oath or affirmation of office made by a prime minister, ministers and parliamentary secretaries when entering office is not that contained within this schedule. Rather, it is determined by the prime minister of the day, and administered to them by the Governor-General. This convention has been in place since 1901.  Unwritten conventions  Constitutional conventions are an important part of the Australian constitution. Despite being unwritten, they are understood to be incorporated within the document.This has been mentioned multiple times by the High Court The conventions primarily derive from the unwritten parliamentary conventions within the Westminister system of responsible government. Some notable conventions include the existence of the Prime Minister of Australia, as head of cabinet in council. Another is that the Governor-General by convention acts on the advice of the Prime Minister. = Unwritten conventions during the dismissal = The nature of constitutional conventions gave rise to controversy during the dismissal of the Whitlam Government in 1975. In that episode, the Governor-General Sir John Kerr advised the Queen to dismiss the Labor Prime Minister Gough Whitlam, and appoint the Liberal opposition leader Malcolm Fraser as caretaker Prime Minister pending the 1975 general election. Multiple conventions were broken during the dismissal including: * The convention that a State Governments would nominate replacement senators of the same political party in the event of a vacancy. This convention was broken by the Lewis government of New South Wales and then by the Bjelke-Petersen government of Queensland (Bjelke-Petersen appointee Albert Patrick Field was expelled from the Labor Party before taking his seat).Gough Whitlam. The Truth of the Matter. Penguin. 1979 (Reprint: Melbourne University Press. 2005.) Notably, this unwritten convention was later formally incorporated into the written constitution via national referendum in 1977. * The convention that the Senate would not vote against money supply to the government. The Liberal- Country party coalition blocked supply to the government in 1975, forcing an election. * The convention that a Prime Minister who cannot obtain supply must first either request the governor general call a general election, or resign. Gough Whitlam broke this convention by refusing to call an election after the Senate's block of supply. Interpretation The High Court is primarily responsible for interpreting the Constitution. Multiple legal doctrines have been applied by the court in its interpretive process. e.g. the 'separation of powers', the 'intergovernmental immunities' doctrine, the (now defunct) 'reserved state powers' doctrine, among others. While the document does not include a Bill of Rights, some expressly stated rights and/or restrictions are established. Among these are s80 right to trial by jury, the s51(xxxi) right to just compensation, the s117 right against discrimination based on state residence, and the s116 clause prohibiting religious tests for office or establishment of religion. The High Court has also read a number of important legal implications into the document. One of these is the 'freedom of political communication', the other is a freedom of interference from voting in at elections. Both doctrines are borne of the s7 and s24 requirements that representatives in Australia's houses of parliament be 'directly chosen by the people'... These doctrines have been characterised as 'freedoms' or 'guarantees' by members of the High Court, and the court has been wary of describing them as 'implied rights' or 'implied constitutional rights'. Some scholars have argued that the High Court's purported distinction between a 'right' versus a 'freedom' is misleading and/or little more than semantic, but the term remains in contemporary usage by the court.  Alterations to the Constitution = Historical referendums and amendments = Amendment to the Constitution requires a referendum in which the amending act is approved by a majority in at least four States, as well as a nation-wide majority. Forty four proposals to amend the Constitution have been voted on at referendums, only eight of which have been approved. Referendums to have achieved approval are: * 1906Senate Electionsamended section 13 to slightly alter the length and dates of Senators' terms of office. * 1910State Debtsamended section 105 to extend the power of the Commonwealth to take over pre-existing State debts, to debts incurred by a State at any time. * 1928State Debtsinserted section 105A to ensure the constitutional validity of the financial agreement reached between the Commonwealth and State governments in 1927. * 1946Social Servicesinserted section 51 (xxiiiA) to extend the power of the Commonwealth over a range of social services. * 1967Aboriginal Australiansamended section 51 (xxvi) to extend the powers of the Commonwealth to Indigenous Australians in States; repealed section 127 preventing the inclusion of all Indigenous Australians in population counts for constitutional purposes. * 1977 - Three amendments: First to ensure Senate casual vacancies be filled by a member of the same political party; Second to allow residents of Australian Territories to vote in referendums; Third to mandate a retirement age of 70 for judges in federal courts. = Existing major amendment proposals = Multiple ongoing debates exist regarding changes to the Australian constitution. These include debates on the inclusion of a preamble, proposals for an Australian republic, the addition of a formal recognition and/or Indigenous voice to the document, among other changes.  Inclusion of a preamble  The Australian constitution does not itself contain a preamble, although a enacting formulae prefaces the document as passed in the UK Parliament. Proposals to include a preamble have been controversial, one argument being that the inclusion of a preamble may affect the High Court's interpretations of other provisions within the document. In 1999, a proposed preamble principally authored by the then Prime Minister John Howard was defeated in a referendum concurrent to that on a proposal to become a republic. Republic proposals Debates on whether Australian should become a republic have existed since Federation. In November 1999 a referendum was held as to whether the Queen & Governor-General ought be removed from the Australian Constitution, to be replaced with a President. The referendum failed to carry. Indigenous recognition and voice Since 1910, there have been calls for constitutional reform to recognise Indigenous Australians. In 1967, the constitution was amended providing the Commonwealth with the power to legislate for all Indigenous Australians by removing the restriction preventing the Commonwealth from legislating in states. At the same time, a limitation on including all Indigenous Australians in population counts for constitutional purposes was removed which in 1967 was now relevant to only section 24. Since those reforms, other proposals have emerged. Guaranteed parliamentary representatives, a constitutionally recognized 'voice', and an inclusion of indigenous Australians in a preamble to the constitution; are all proposals that have been made to reform the Australian constitution to further recognise indigenous Australians. In his Closing the Gap speech in February 2020, Prime Minister Morrison reinforced the work of the Referendum Council, rejecting the idea of merely symbolic recognition, supporting a Voice co-designed by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, \\"using the language of listening and empowerment\\". The Labor Party has supported a Voice enshrined in the Constitution for a long time, and so have many of Australia's left leaning minor parties.

The film tells a story about a chorus girl who wants to marry a rich playboy, but first has to prove herself to his financial advisor. The screenplay was written by Kenneth Earl, Curtis Kenyon, and Harry Segall, adapted from a short story written by Jane Allen entitled \\"A Girl's Best Friend Is Wall Street,\\" published in 1938 in Cosmopolitan Magazine.  Plot  A chorus girl, Gloria Winters (Joan Bennett), is overjoyed that wealthy young Randy Bradford (John Hubbard) is so eager to marry her, he's asked her to elope. Before they can leave, Randy is contacted by Mark Willows (Franchot Tone), a partner with the Wall Street financial organization that Randy's father founded, as well as Randy's financial advisor. Willows stipulates that Randy will be disinherited should he elope with this girl. Gloria is naturally upset. She comes up with a plan to gain Willows approval through work and receive a letter of recommendation, which can then be used as their marriage license. When she goes to see Willows, she expects an older man and is thrown off-balance by his youth and charm. Without revealing her true identity, Gloria lands a job at Willows' firm as a switchboard operator. A slip of the tongue on her part, however, costs Willows a great deal of money and she is fired. Willows calms down and tries to make it up to her, visiting the apartment Gloria shares with Sally Long, another chorus girl. While there, Willows offers Gloria her job back, in which she accepts. Gloria and Willow continue to advance both their professional and personal relationships, both in and out of the office. Randy starts to see the chemistry forming between the two and gets jealous. He goes to Willows and demands a job as well, and their plan foils. Willows learns Gloria's true identity and agrees to allow Randy and Gloria to get married, in an attempt to mask his feelings for Gloria. While walking down the aisle at the wedding, a ghost like figure of each character acts as a personification of their inner thoughts and the viewer learns that Randy no longer wants to get married and Gloria and Willows have both fallen for each other. Randy pretends to faint in hopes of ending the wedding, and Gloria and Willows take this opportunity to run away together.Segall, Harry. She Knew All The Answers.

Its name derives from the place name mapachtepec, \\"Hill of the Raccoon\\", a compound of the Nahuatl words mapachi (\\"raccoon\\") and tepetl (\\"mountain\\") . Mapestepec is on the Pacific Ocean, with roughly half of its territory on the Pacific Coastal Plain and half in the Sierra Madre de Chiapas mountain range. It is partly within two of Mexico's Biosphere Reserves, featuring a number of important species, including the horned guan (Oreophasis derbianus), Baird's tapir (Tapirus bairdii), the Jaguar (Panthera once) and rare cloud forest and mangrove habitat. The primary sector makes up over half of the local economy. Key products include cheese and dairy products and the local Ataulfo mango. History Mapastepec was founded in 1486 as an Aztec tributary state, under the name of Mapacht√©pec. In 1611, the first census conducted by the colonial authorities recorded Mapastepec's population as 265. Mapastepec was upgraded to the status of town (villa) by a decree issued by Ephraim A. Osorio, then governor of the State of Chiapas, on July 5, 1955. =Key dates in recent history= * 1915 - Abolition of territorial administrative structure under political authorities (the Jefaturas pol√≠ticas), with subsequent reorganization and creation of free municipalities * 1955 - On July 5, State Governor Efrain A. Osorio promulgates decree granting the status of \\"town\\" to the municipal capital * 1962 - Construction of Pacific coastal road, with connecting road to Mapastepec (see also Mexican Federal Highway 200) * 1983 - Mapastepec integrated into Soconusco, political region VIII of the state of Chiapas * 1984 - Town Hall built to house the Municipal Presidency * 1990 - Creation of El Triunfo natural protected area, which became a Biosphere Reserve in 1993 * 1995 - Creation of La Encrucijada natural protected area, recognized as a Biosphere Reserve in 2006 * 1998 - Heavy rains in September cause rivers to overflow, destroying the village of Valdivia * 2005 - Hurricane Stan washes away part of the coastal railway line Geography=Location= The municipality of Mapastec is situated in the southern part of the state of Chiapas. It is bounded by the municipalities of La Concordia, √Ångel Albino Corzo and Montecristo de Guerrero to the north, Siltepec, Acacoyagua and Acapetahua to the east, the Pacific Ocean to the south, and Pijijiapan to the west. The municipality covers an area of , representing 19.81% of the Soconusco region and 1.44% of the state of Chiapas. It stretches from the Pacific Ocean to the Sierra Madre de Chiapas mountain range, with a maximum altitude of above sea level (a.s.l.). The highest peaks are La Cumbre, La Bandera and El Pujido. Mountainous and hilly terrain makes up approximately 50% of the area of the municipality, with low foothills accounting for another 10%. 40% of its territory lies on the Pacific coastal plain, and some 6% of this area is alluvial floodplain and saltmarsh. Alluvial soils predominate. The town of Mapestepec, the municipal capital, is at a.s.l. The main rivers of Mapastepec are the R√≠o Novillero, R√≠o San Nicol√°s, R√≠o Gobierno and R√≠o Las Flores. Smaller perennial streams include the Arroyo Sesecapa, Arroyo Tablas√≥n and Arroyo Cuilapa. A number of intermittent streams run through the municipality. The principal bodies of water are the Chantuto, Pampa Buenavista and Pampa Casta√±a lagoons, and the El Coco estuary. =Climate= Hot and humid from January to September and a milder coastal climate from October to December. Its average annual temperature is , with an average annual rainfall of . The heaviest rainfall occurs from June to September. Demographics=Population= The total population of the municipality was 47,932 at the time of the 2015 Intercensal Survey, conducted by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (Instituto Nacional de Estad√≠stica y Geograf√≠a - INEGI). This represented an increase from 43,913 in 2010, and 39,055 in 2005. In 2015, women made up 50.9% of the inhabitants of the municipality and men 49.1%, with an average age of 24. The population represented 0.9% of the state of Chiapas. The population of the town of Mapastepec was 17,931 in 2010, followed by Sesecapa (2,143) and Nuevo Milenio Valdivia (1,789). In 2015, 52 of the 118 localities in the municipality had more than 100 inhabitants. Isolation and the poor condition of roads, particularly at higher altitudes, makes access to public services difficult for many of the smaller settlements. =Indigenous languages= The 2010 Census of Population and Housing (Censo de Poblaci√≥n y Vivienda 2010) recorded 131 speakers of an indigenous language in Mapastepec, representing 0.33 percent of its population. The most widely spoken of these languages were Zapotec (41), Mame) (13), Tzotzil (13) and Tzeltal (12), with another twelve languages represented. An additional 34 respondents did not specify which indigenous language they spoke. =Religion= As at 2005, 65.68% of the population was Catholic, higher than the figure for the region of Soconusco (58.98%) and slightly above the national figure of 63.83%. 14.77% of the population was Protestant, 4.81% non-evangelical biblical, and 13.07% professed no religion. Environment=Protected areas= More than half of the territory of Mapastepec (51.85%) is situated in protected and conservation areas, totalling . The Huizapa-Sesecapa Reforestation Area (Zona de Reforestaci√≥n Huizapa-Sesecapa) lies on the Pacific coastal plain. Created by decree of October 8, 1936, it was the first protected natural area in the state of Chiapas. The Pico El Loro-Paxtal ecological conservation zone was created by decree of November 22, 2000 to protect cloud forest in the Sierra Madre de Chiapas foothills. Parts of Mapastepec are within two important natural reserves in the World Network of Biosphere Reserves designated by the UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Programme. The El Triunfo reserve, created by decree of March 13, 1990, was inscribed on the list of Mexican Biosphere Reserves in 1993. It contains two of the most endangered ecosystems in Mexico: the Soconusco tropical rainforest, and cloud forest growing to over 2,000 meters (6,600 ft) above sea level. La Encrucijada Biosphere Reserve, established as a reserve by decree on June 6, 1995, was inscribed on the list of Biosphere Reserves in 2006. La Encrucijada is also protected under the Ramsar Convention, figuring on the List of Ramsar wetlands of international importance. It was inscribed on the list of Ramsar sites in Mexico on March 20, 1996. Located to the south of the town of Mapastepec, La Encrucijada contains one of the most significant wetland and coastal lagoon networks in Mexico, with mangroves among the tallest of the Pacific coast of the Americas. Both the El Triunfo and La Encrucijada Biosphere Reserves are under the administration of the National Commission of Protected Natural Areas (Comisi√≥n Nacional de √Åreas Naturales Protegidas, CONANP), an agency of the Federal government. CONANP has a water management office for El Triunfo Biosphere Reserve in the town of Mapastepec. =Flora= Ceiba pentandra The vegetation of Mapastepec varies from the lowland jungle and mangroves of the Pacific coastal plain to oak‚Äìpine forest in the high mountains of the Sierra Madre de Chiapas. Emblematic mangrove and lowland species in La Encrucijada Biosphere Reserve include the red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle), white mangrove (Laguncularia racemosa), black mangrove (Avicennia germinans), buttonwood (Conocarpus erectus), gumbo-limbo, also known as copperwood, or chaca (Bursera simaruba), Mexican palmetto (Sabal mexicana), (Cyperus spp.), and Malabar chestnut, or saba nut (Pachira aquatica). Other species growing in the lowland areas and adjacent highlands include (Pithecellobium dulce), and pinguin (Bromelia pinguin). The cloud forest of El Triunfo Biosphere Reserve also contains a rich diversity of orchids, cycads and tree ferns (Cyatheales). Among other species are the hardwood Ecuador laurel or salmwood (Cordia alliodora) in the high forests, the guanacaste (Enterolobium cyclocarpum), the ceiba or kapok (Ceiba pentandra), the lowland evergreen sapodilla (Manilkara zapota), Calycophyllum (Calycophyllum candidissimum), and the yellow-wood (Terminalia oblongata). Fruits include avocados, mamey, mango, custard apple, soursop, papausa, cuajinicuil, and caspirol. =Fauna= The endangered horned guan (pav√≥n cornudo; Oreophasis derbianus), considered the state bird, is found in El Triunfo Biosphere Reserve in the high mountains of Mapastepec and neighboring municipalities. Also present is the emblem of the reserve, the Resplendent quetzal (Pharomachrus mocinno). Other key species include Azure- rumped tanager (Poecilostreptus cabanisi), the king vulture (Sarcoramphus papa), Baird's tapir (Tapirus bairdii); the Jaguar (Panthera once), the oncilla (Leopardus tigrinus) and the otter (Lutrinae). Also found are hummingbirds, the harpy eagle, hawk, parrot, owl, skylark, chupamiel, mockingbird, rook, buzzard, pigeons, doves, yellow-throated toucans and many other bird species. Mammals and reptiles include the spider monkey, raccoon, porcupine, anteater, skunk, deer, puma, bobcat, agouti, wild boar, opossum, rabbit, rattlesnake, coral snake, false coral snake, nahuyaca, and Chichicua. There is high insect diversity. Emblematic species of La Encrucijada Biosphere Reserve on the coastal plain include the northern tamandua (Tamandua mexicana), orange-chinned parakeet (Brotogeris jugularis), American crocodile (Crocodylus acutus), spectacled caiman (Caiman crocodilus), green iguana (Iguana iguana), wood stork (Mycteria americana), orange-fronted parakeet (Aratinga canicularis), nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), boa constrictor (Boa constrictor), black spiny- tailed iguana (Ctenosaura similis), olive ridley sea turtle (Lepidochelys olivacea), and scorpion mud turtle (Kinosternum scorpioides). Also endemic to the area are the cinnamon-tailed sparrow (Peucaea sumichrasti), berylline hummingbird (Amazilia berillyna), green-fronted hummingbird (Amazilia viridifrons), giant wren (Campylorhynchus chiapensis), Mexican hairy dwarf porcupine (Coendou mexicanus), Mexican spiny-tailed iguana (Ctenosaura pectinata), flammulated flycatcher (Deltarhynchus flammulatus), Red-breasted chat (Granatellus venustus), West Mexican chachalaca (Ortalis poliocephala), rose-bellied bunting (Passerina rositae), longtail spiny lizard (Sceloporus siniferus), citreoline trogon (Trogon citreolus), Sonora mud turtle (Kinosternon sonoriense), and the cinnamon myotis bat (Myotis fortidens). =Environmental issues= Chiapas has a wide variety of natural resources. Heavy exploitation over many years, in particular of timber, has led to significant deforestation in the municipality, causing species loss and environmental degradation. Logging and forest fires are also associated with the leaching of nutrients from the soil and with soil erosion, aggravated by heavy rainfall. Pollution of local waterways is related to agricultural activities including fertilizer use. These environmental issues are the focus of municipal government ecological management, conservation and sustainability planning. Cultural and tourist attractions=Festivals= The most important feast days celebrated in Mapastepec are the feast day of the Se√±or de Esquipulas, honoring the Black Christ of Esquipulas on January 15, and the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul on June 29. Paul the Apostle (San Pedro Apostol) is considered the patron saint of the town of Mapastepec. The town also honors the Virgin of Guadalupe. Easter, the Day of the Dead (), Christmas and the New Year are also celebrated. In March, a trade and agriculture fair is held in the town of Mapastepec, featuring associated cultural events and musical performances. Since 2016 it has been promoted as the Cheese Fair (Feria del Queso), a showcase for local dairy produce. =Crafts= Handcrafted woodcuts are made in the municipality. =Gastronomy= Typical dishes of the municipality are iguana tamales, armadillo stew, baked chicken, marshmallow candies, nuegados chilacayote, coconut water, beer, cocoa, and white pozol. =Sports= The four main football fields in Mapastepec are the November 20 field, Santa Cruz, Olimpia and Anahuac. In addition to other sports, the traditional sport of Charrer√≠a is also popular. Economic activity The economy of the municipality is based on agriculture, beef and dairy cattle and other livestock farming, fishing and aquaculture, forestry and construction, tourism, trade and services. The dairy industry, celebrated in the annual Cheese Fair is a significant sector, producing some 20 major cheeses including cream cheese, mediacrema cheese, cheese snacks, cheese, Cotija cheese, and cream. =Agriculture and livestock= The primary sector occupies more than half of the working population of the municipality (52.82% in 2000). The agricultural sector is the largest economic sector. The principal crops grown are avocado, banana, cocoa beans, coffee beans, fodder, green chili peppers, green beans, maize, mango, oranges, African oil palm, parlour palm (Chamaedorea spp.), rice, sesame, sorghum and watermelon. Approximately half of the municipality lies on the Pacific coastal plain, facilitating extensive agriculture and allowing for significant mechanization. Agricultural tractors are widely used. Mapastepec grows many kinds of mango. Varieties include the Ataulfo mango, a protected designation of origin cultivar originating locally from the Soconusco region of Chiapas. Also grown are the cultivars known in Mexico as Criollo, Jobo, Manila and Manililla, and the Tommy Atkins. The livestock sector includes beef and dairy cattle and poultry, as well as sheep, pigs and horses. =Tourism= The beaches of the Pacific coast are one of the main draws for tourists in the municipality. Ecological reserves constitute another point of interest. They include the El Triunfo Biosphere Reserve, with its cloud forest and tropical rainforest habitats, and the wetlands, coastal lagoons and mangroves of La Encrucijada Biosphere Reserve, which is also a Ramsar wetland site. According to information from the Ministry of Tourism, in the year 2000 the town of Mapastepec had five hotels with 53 rooms. =Services= Most of the services available in the municipality are found in the town of Mapestepec. These include public transportn, gas and service stations, hotels and restaurants, garages and repair shops, a hospital, clinics, and medical professionals. The town Mapastepec has a Rural Hospital with a number of medical units run by the Mexican Social Security Institute (Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, IMSS) under its IMSS Prospera program Health services provided include an emergency department, surgical facilities, a labor ward, a pediatrics department, a general hospital and laboratory services. =Railway= There were two unsuccessful attempts to build a railway along the coast of Chiapas in the 19th century before an Anglo-American company, The Mexican Pacific Railroad Limited, built the Pan American Railway (Ferrocarril Panamericano) in the early 20th century. Work began in 1902 with initial repairs to a short existing rail segment from the port town of Puerto Arista on the northern coast of Chiapas in 1902. In 1903, construction began in San Jer√≥nimo Doctor (now Ixtepec) in the state of Oaxaca, building south towards the Guatemalan border. Work was completed as far as Tonal√° in Chiapas by December of that year. The railway reached the municipalities of Pijijiapan and Mapastepec in 1906, arriving at Suchiate on the border with Guatemala on July 1, 1908. The national rail operator Ferrocarriles Nacionales de M√©xico took over the line in 1914. It was privatized in 1999 under a 30-year concession to Genesee & Wyoming subsidiary Ferrocarriles Chiapas-Mayab. Ferrocarriles Chiapas-Mayab gave up its concession in 2007 after Hurricane Stan badly damaged the line in October 2005, rendering it inoperable. State-owned company Ferrocarril Trans√≠stmico took over the concession in 2008, and the line has since been known as the Isthmus of Tehuantepec Railway (Ferrocarril del Istmo de Tehuantepec). Work was done to repair a number of bridges but the line remained out of commission. In 2015, a feasibility study was conducted into repairing and rehabilitating the line.

Civic history By the nineteenth century the neighbouring townships of Middleton and Tonge formed a single town. The townships, separated by the River Irk, lay in different parishes and local administration was in the hands of constables appointed by the Lord of the Manor. In 1861 a local act of parliament established Middleton and Tonge Improvement Commissioners to provide public services in the area. In 1879 the improvement commissioners district was enlarged to take in Alkrington and parts of Hopwood and Thornham. Following a petition by the inhabitant householders of the improvement commissioners district, a charter of incorporation was granted on 21 July 1886, constituting the area as the Municipal Borough of Middleton. The borough was enlarged in 1894 by the addition of parts of the townships of Great Heaton and Little Heaton, and the boundaries with neighbouring districts were adjusted in 1933 by a County Review Order. The borough was abolished by the Local Government Act 1972, with its area becoming part of the Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale in the new county of Greater Manchester in 1974. Borough council The charter created an elected town council for the borough, consisting of a mayor, six aldermen and eighteen councillors. The borough was divided into three wards, and two councillors were elected for a three-year term in each ward annually. Each ward was also represented by two alderman: half of the aldermanic bench were elected by the council every three years, and they each served for six years. The mayor was elected annually from among the council's membership. In the early years the borough council appears to have non-political, and elections were rarely contested, with an agreed panel of candidates standing unopposed.Municipal Elections, The Times, November 2, 1894, p.6, November 3, 1897, p.4 In later years the council was broadly Conservative in complexion. Following the Second World War elections were held on party political lines. The Conservative Party had an overall majority until 1957, with Labour, Liberal and Independent councilors in opposition. In 1957 the size of the borough council was increased from twenty-four to thirty-six. The Labour Party gained control of the enlarged council, and held it until 1960.The Times, May 10, 1957, p.6; May 13, 1960, p.10 Apart from one year under no overall control, the administration of the borough alternated between the Conservatives (1960‚Äì1963 and 1969‚Äì1971) and Labour (1963‚Äì1969 and 1972‚Äì1974).The Times, May 10, 1963; May 12, 1969, p.12; May 12, 1969; May 14, 1971, p.4; May 5, 1972 Coat of arms The Mayor, Alderman and Burgesses of Middleton were granted armorial bearings by the College of Arms on 28 January 1877. The blazon of the arms was as follows: Quarterly per pale nebuly gules and argent on a fesse ermine between a cross patonce of the second in the first quarter a mullet sable pierced of the field in the second a silkworm moth volant in the third and a rock in base thereon a stork in the fourth three sprigs of the cotton tree slipped and fructed all proper, and for a crest on a wreath of the colours upon a mount vert between two boars' heads erect and couped sable a tower proper suspended therefrom by a riband gules an escutcheon Or charged with a lion passant also gules.A C Fox-Davies, The Book of Public Arms, 2nd edition, London, 1915 The design combined features from the arms of local families with symbols of the town's industries. The basic layout of the shield was based on the arms of Middleton of Middleton Hall: \\"Quarterly gules and Or in the first a cross flory argent\\", while the black spur-rowel came from the arms of the Assheton family. The textile industries of Middleton were depicted by the cotton sprigs and silk worm moth. According to the borough council the stork represented \\"the desire for the increase in population'\\". The crest above the shield was made up of a tower and lion from the heraldry of the Earls of Middleton between two boars' heads from the arms of another Middleton family. The borough borrowed the Latin motto of the Middleton Earls: Fortis in Arduis or \\"strong in difficulties\\".W C Scott-Giles, Civic Heraldry of England and Wales, 2nd edition, London, 1953 References Middleton History of Lancashire History of the Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale Local government in the Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale Middleton Middleton, Greater Manchester ","title":"Municipal Borough of Middleton"},{"id":"18579773","text":"is a contemporary art gallery founded in 1990 by Michiyasu Itsutsuji.

She was one of two Somali athletes who competed for their nation at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China. Omar had grown up in Mogadishu, and trained there during the Somali Civil War despite receiving harassment from local militia groups. Her story at the Olympics was covered by the media, and her performance was well received by the crowd. Following the Games, she hid away from athletics following threats by militant group Al- Shabaab. She ended up in a Hizbul-Islam displacement camp, and in pursuit of competing at the 2012 Summer Olympics, she crossed the border to Ethiopia looking for a safe place to train. She was trafficked north into Libya, where she was imprisoned. During the 2012 Games, it was revealed that Omar had drowned off the coast of Libya while attempting to cross the Mediterranean Sea to Italy. Early life Samia Yusuf Omar was born in Somalia on 25 March 1991, to Omar Yusuf and Dahabo Ali and was the oldest of six children. Her mother was an athlete who competed at a national level within Somalia. The family came from one of the country's minority ethnic groups. Both Omar's father and uncle were killed following a mortar attack on Bakaara Market, where they worked. Omar was in the eighth grade at the time, and she dropped out of school in response to look after her siblings while her mother sold produce to provide for the family. Following the encouragement of her mother, she decided to take up running. She would train at Mogadishu Stadium, as the family lived nearby in a hovel. The stadium had a gravel running track, pitted with mortar craters from the ongoing Somali Civil War. When not running at the stadium, she would run on the streets of Mogadishu, facing harassment from local militants who did not believe that Muslim women should participate in sporting activities. Sporting competitions In April 2008, at the 2008 African Championships in Athletics in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, she finished last in her heat. Omar was selected by the Somali Olympic Committee to compete in the 200 metres at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China, between 8 and 24 August 2008. She said the call-up was unexpected, both because of her young age at the time, and because she was from a minority ethnic group. Because of a lack of funding, Omar competed in equipment donated by the Sudanese team, lining up in a heat which included eventual gold medallist Veronica Campbell- Brown from Jamaica. Omar finished some nine seconds adrift of the other runners, with a time of 32.16. The crowd in the stadium gave a huge level of support to Omar, with journalist Charles Robinson saying \\"I literally got goosebumps. They were just sort of pushing her.\\" and The Guardian suggesting that she received a louder cheer than Campbell-Brown. The story of the Somali girl was picked up by the media prior to the race, but afterwards the interest died down due to the language barrier between Omar and the interviewers and because of her lack of interest in publicising herself. Post Olympics Her competition at the Olympics received little coverage in Somalia. Her heat took place at midnight in the East African time zone, and no television or radio broadcasts of it were made locally. As such, none of her family had seen her compete. After a confrontation with the militant group Al-Shabaab, she was left shaken and no longer admitted to others that she was an athlete. By December 2009, she and her family were living in a displacement camp organised by the Islamic insurgent group Hizbul-Islam, located about outside Mogadishu. Al-Shabaab had banned all women from participating in or watching sports. In 2011, Omar fled the fighting of the civil war and moved to Addis Abeba, leaving her family behind, partly to pursue her dream of competing at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, United Kingdom. Now a middle-distance athlete, she was due to begin training with former Olympian Eshetu Tura, who was recommended to her by the prominent Qatar-based Somali track coach Jama Aden and the Olympic medalist Mohamed Suleiman. She was allowed to train with the middle distance Ethiopian team once approval from the Ethiopian Olympic Committee was received. Her personal best time when first meeting with the Ethiopian team was 5 minutes for the 1500 metres; it was made clear that she would need to meet 4:20 to be competitive. She built up a friendship with Al Jazeera journalist Teresa Krug, who covered her story both at the Olympics and afterwards. Krug later reported that in a desire to find a coach, Omar travelled north towards Europe, crossing the Sudans and entering Libya. Both Omar's family and Krug attempted to talk her out of it, and to remain in Ethiopia where the Somali Olympic Committee were hoping to set up a training camp. Instead, she had paid people smugglers to take her to Libya, where she was imprisoned for a period. Death and legacy On 19 August 2012, the Corriere della Sera reported that Samia had died while on her way to Italy on a boat from Libya. The information came from her compatriot and fellow runner Abdi Bile, and was \\"difficult to verify\\" according to the newspaper. The story came to light during the 2012 Summer Olympics, although Omar's death had occurred earlier that year in April. On 21 August, the BBC reported that it had received confirmation of Omar's death from Somalia's National Olympic Committee. The Huffington Post reported that Qadijo Aden Dahir, the Deputy Chairman for Somalia's athletics federation, had confirmed that Omar had drowned off the Libyan seaboard while trying to reach Italy from her home in Ethiopia. Qadijo added that \\"it's a sad death... She was our favourite for the London Olympics\\". Exact details of her death eventually came to light; she boarded a packed boat with 70 other people in an attempt to cross the Mediterranean Sea and reach Italy. The boat soon ran out of petrol and was adrift off the coast of Libya. When an Italian Navy vessel arrived to offer assistance, it threw ropes over the side to the refugees. In the chaos that ensued as people attempting to grab the ropes, Omar was knocked into the sea, where witnesses saw her treading water for a while, but eventually drowned. Her story has been described in the book Non dirmi che hai paura (\\"Never say you are afraid\\") by Italian writer and journalist Giuseppe Catozzella. The rights for the English language version of the novel was acquired by Penguin Books, and there was interest in turning the work into a film. In 2015, German graphic novelist Reinhard Kleist published his graphic novel Der Traum von Olympia ‚Äì Die Geschichte von Samia Yusuf Omar (\\"An Olympic Dream ‚Äì The Story of Samia Yusuf Omar\\") at Carlsen Verlag. It was named the Luchs book of the year for 2015. The graphic novel was translated into English and published by SelfMadeHero in 2016.

He was in succession, second in command of the CARTE network (under Andr√© Girard), then head of the SOE (F section) network DONKEYMAN, rising to the rank of major within SOE. He was betrayed to the Germans, deported and executed. Early Life Henri Jacques Paul Frager was born in France on 3 March 1897 the son of Alphonse Jean Frager and Eug√©nie Louis Adolpine Frager n√©e Sauvier, he married the Russian-born Louba Frager and worked as an architect in Nice in civil life. On 25 November 1940 he dined with Andr√© Girard in a restaurant in Antibes. Girard wanted to develop a local network, whereas Frager was then preparing to get to London via Algeria. He reached Algeria in December that year but, after several failed attempts to get from there to London, returned to Antibes in April 1941 and got back into contact with Girard, who recruited him into CARTE as his second in command under the codename Louba. With Andr√© Gillois and Colonel Vautrin, Girard and Frager recruited others for the growing network, and on 19 September 1941 Girard had his first meeting with an SOE agent, Francis Basin (codename Olive).  Wartime activities  Exploring the possibilities for CARTE-SOE cooperation, SOE summoned Girard or any other officer of CARTE to come to London. Not wanting to go himself, Girard sent Frager and, on 30 June 1942, the Polish trawler Tarana took on Frager and brought him to Gibraltar, from where he flew to England by plane. In London that July, at Orchard Court, he met SOE's chiefs (Maurice Buckmaster, Nicholas Bodington, and probably Charles Hambro and Colin Gubbins). In Girard's name, Frager set out CARTE's needs (means of communication, arms, etc.). Wanting to know more, SOE sent him back to France with Nicholas Bodington (codename Jean-Paul or PROFESSOR) to study the possibilities of cooperation, clarify the confused situation in the Lyon region and organised possible parachute drop-zones (SPRUCE). They were landed at Cap d'Antibes on the night of 29/30 July 1942 from the boat Seadog, with agents Harry Despaigne (MAGNOLIA) and Yvonne Rudellat (SOAPTREE), and on 12 September Bodington returned to England to make a highly favourable report on CARTE. In November 1942, however, major disagreements broke out between Girard and Frager. The Germans having occupied the previously unoccupied zone of France, SOE wanted to review its plans with CARTE and demanded in a message on 12 November (received via Adolphe Rabinovitch, radio operator of the SPINDLE network) that Girard return to London. Several pick-up attempts that December failed and Frager prepared a report criticising Girard, to be transmitted to London, but Girard found out and also noted the good relations between Frager and Peter Churchill. In January‚ÄìFebruary 1943, Girard put off his departure for London indefinitely, before finally being picked up by a Hudson on the night of 21/22 February. Frager and Churchill were picked up by Lysander on the night of 23/24 March (landing at Estr√©es-Saint-Denis near Compi√®gne, piloted by Hugh Verity, flying in Francis Cammaerts and Georges Duboudin) and joined Girard in London. However, Girard refused to meet them and SOE distanced itself from Girard, opposing his return to France and warning Frager that he would have to lead what remained of the CARTE network against Hugo Bleicher (known as \\"colonel Henri\\") . On the night of 14/15 April 1943 Frager was returned to France by Lysander (BRONCHITE drop zone, near Tours) and welcomed back by Henri D√©ricourt (GILBERT). He flew to London again on 20/21 October 1943 (in a Hudson, from the ACHILLE landing strip near Angers), but his pick-up had been organised by D√©ricourt, now under Sicherheitsdienst surveillance. An altercation occurred before this between Frager and D√©ricourt over breakfast in a caf√© facing Angers' train station. Frager had brought along his substitute and friend, Roger Bardet (in fact released from prison by Bleicher in exchange for Bardet feeding him information, a promise Bardet seems to have kept), to assist in his departure for London, but D√©ricourt forbade him from doing so. Frager also believed D√©ricourt to be a Gestapo agent and D√©ricourt suspected that Frager thought as much. Hugo Bleicher wrote in his book of his recruitment of Roger Bardet as V-Mann, and how Bardet had got into Frager's good books by revealing to him that D√©ricourt was a double agent working for Kieffer. There was no sympathy between Bleicher (and the Abwehr) and Kieffer (of the SD). Hugh Verity gives Bleicher's account thus: > Paul (Frager) once more took the plane to London. He hoped to return about > 15 days later. His visit was facilitated by Gilbert, who once more enjoyed > the British's confidence and had become head of all personnel on the ground > for secret flights and landings by SOE's French section. This made it hard > for Paul to accept Gilbert as the organisor of his visit. On this occasion > there was an argument between them that Roger told me about. Roger had > accompanied Paul to the secret landing strip. They had scarcely arrived when > Gilbert told Roger to accompany Paul to London, telling him that the order > came from F section in London. He opposed this order, and was embarked on > the plane by force. Ignorant of all this, Paul also had his suspicions. I > suppose Gilbert, who came into Kieffer's office daily and knew the SD > officers well, had been informed by them of Roger's true role and he thus > wanted to dispose of him by sending him to London with a denunciation on his > head. If Gilbert had got there, Paul's position would have been shaken. > There was a serious altercation between Paul and Gilbert. Only Paul's > determination, threatening to use his pistol, prevented Roger from being > kidnapped and transferred to London by force. Henri Frager's graveHenri Frager plaque in Boulevard du Montparnasse, Paris On 29 February 1944 Frager was returned to France at Beg-an-Fry near Morlaix, under the codename Jean-Marie. He was sent as head of the DONKEYMAN network, with orders to develop Resistance groups in the Yonne and on the C√¥te d'Azur. His networks developed normally, one under Bardet and the other under Kieffer (Kiki). A group headed by Frager sabotaged the celophane factory at Mantes, and reports and photographs of its missions were sent to London. Between June and August 1944, Frager's groups were supplied by 25 parachute drops, but Frager was betrayed by Bardet and handed over to Bleicher on 8 August 1944.Flames in the Fields, Rita Kramer, Penguin books, 1966 Deported to Buchenwald concentration camp, he was executed on 5 October that year.

As well as playing club cricket for Kidderminster, Ralph played many times for Worcestershire's Second XI between 1994 and 1996, and a run of good scores in the latter year earned him what turned out to be his only first-class appearance, against South Africa A in August. He failed to grasp the opportunity, however, being dismissed for a pair, and his brief first-class career ended almost as soon as it had begun. In 1998 Ralph returned to representative cricket with Shropshire in the Minor Counties Championship, and made a number of List A appearances for them in the NatWest Trophy and its successor the C&G; Trophy. Perhaps his best performance came against Somerset at Telford in 2000: although Shropshire lost the game by 27 runs, Ralph's unbeaten 102 gained him the man-of-the-match award. He took his only two List A wickets against Buckinghamshire in 2002. In club cricket, after playing for some years for Shropshire clubs, and most recently for Shifnal, he returned to Kidderminster Victoria for the 2009 season. In 2012 Ralph moved to Bridgnorth CC in Division three of the Birmingham League, where he was consistently one of the best batsman in the Division.

Visible at left is the arm of a remotely operated vehicle, reaching in to take fluid samples. Loki's Castle is a field of five active hydrothermal vents in the mid-Atlantic Ocean, located at 73 degrees north on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge between Greenland and Norway at a depth of . The vents were discovered in mid-July 2008 and are the most northerly black smokers to date. They are of geological interest as they occur in a relatively stable region of the Earth's crust, one with diminished tectonic forces and consequently fewer hydrothermal vents. Discovery The vents were discovered by a 25-person multinational scientific expedition of the University of Bergen, Norway, more than north of what were previously the northernmost known, discovered in 2005. The 2005 and 2008 expeditions were both led by geologist Rolf Pedersen of the university‚Äôs Centre for Geobiology, aboard the research vessel G.O. Sars (named after the Norwegian marine biologist Georg Ossian Sars and launched in May 2003). The vents were located using a remotely controlled undersea vehicle. Activity The five active chimneys of Loki's Castle are venting water as hot as 300 ¬∞C (570 ¬∞F) and sit on a vast mound of sulfide minerals which is about 825 ft (250 m) in diameter at its base, and some 300 feet (90 m) across its top. A member of the 2008 expedition, oceanographer Marvin Lilley has speculated that this may be the largest such deposit ever seen on the sea floor. The active chimneys are mostly black in colour, but are covered with mats of white bacteria which are living on minerals and materials emitted by the vents. The older chimneys are a mottled red colour, due to the presence of deposits of oxidised iron. Preliminary observations have shown the warm area around the Loki's Castle vents to be alive with diverse and apparently unique microorganisms and vent fauna, unlike vent communities observed elsewhere. One of these is the archaeal phylum Lokiarchaeota, which is named after Loki's Castle. The vent field was given the name Loki's Castle as its shape reminded its discoverers of a fantasy castle. The reference is to the ancient Norse god of trickery, Loki. It was felt to be \\"an appropriate name for a field that was so difficult to locate\\".

Many kinds of FLPs have been devised, and many simple substrates exhibit activation. The discovery that some FLPs split H2 triggered a rapid growth of research into FLPs. Because of their \\"unquenched\\" reactivity, such systems are reactive toward substrates that can undergo heterolysis. For example, many FLPs split hydrogen molecules. Thus, a mixture of tricyclohexylphosphine (PCy3) and tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane reacts with hydrogen to give the respective phosphonium and borate ions: :PCy3 + B(C6F5)3 + H2 -> [HPCy3]+ [HB(C6F5)3]- This reactivity has been exploited to produce FLPs which catalyse hydrogenation reactions. Small molecule activation  Frustrated Lewis pairs have been shown to activate many small molecules, either by inducing heterolysis or by coordination. = Hydrogen = The discovery that some FLPs are able to split, and therefore activate, H2 triggered a rapid growth of research into this area. The activation and therefore use of H2 is important for many chemical and biological transformations. Using FLPs to liberate H2 is metal-free, this is beneficial due to the cost and limited supply of some transition metals commonly used to activate H2 (Ni, Pd, Pt). FLP systems are reactive toward substrates that can undergo heterolysis (e.g hydrogen) due to the \\"unquenched\\" reactivity of such systems. For example, it has been previously shown that a mixture of tricyclohexylphosphine (PCy3) and tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane reacts with H2 to give the respective phosphonium and borate ions: PCy3 + B(C6F5)3 + H2 -> [HPCy3]+ [HB(C6F5)3]- In this reaction, PCy3 (the Lewis Base) and B(C6F5)3 (the Lewis Acid) cannot form an adduct due to the steric hindrance from the bulky cyclohexyl and pentafluorophenyl groups. The proton on the phosphorus and hydride from the borate are now ‚Äòactivated‚Äô and can subsequently be ‚Äòdelivered‚Äô to an organic substrate, resulting in hydrogenation. = Mechanism of dihydrogen activation by FLP = The mechanism for the activation of H2 by FLPs has been discussed for both the intermolecular and intramolecular cases. Intermolecular FLPs are where the Lewis Base is a separate molecule to the Lewis Acid, it is thought that these individual molecules interact through secondary London dispersion interactions to bring the Lewis Base and Acid together (a pre-organisational effect) where small molecules may then interact with the FLPs. The experimental evidence for this type of interaction at the molecular level is unclear. However, there is supporting evidence for this type of interaction based on computational DFT (Density Functional Theory) studies. Intramolecular FLPs are where the Lewis Acid and Lewis Base are combined in one molecule by a covalent linker. Despite the improved ‚Äòpre-organisational effects‚Äô, rigid intramolecular FLP frameworks are thought to have a reduced reactivity to small molecules due to a reduction in flexibility. =Dihydrogen activation example= The activation of H2 using FLPs was first reported in 2006. In this report a phosphonium-borate species was observed to undergo the thermal loss of a H2 molecule, to generate the phosphine and the borane. The phosphonium- borate species 1 was prepared from B(C6F5)3 and (C6H2Me3)2PH, due to the steric demands of both of these molecules a traditional adduct could not be formed and the zwitterionic phosphonic-boronate was prepared [Figure 1]. A ‚ÄúH-for-F exchange‚Äù was carried out to give 2 which was stable to moisture and air. This salt will release molecular H2 when heated above 100 ¬∞C, a colour change was also observed from the colourless 2 to the orange-red 3 (both in THF). This reaction is reversed by reacting 3 with H2 at 25 ‚ÑÉ where the colour change is reversed and 2 is reformed. The reaction of H2 with 3 was successful for temperatures as low as 25 ‚ÑÉ. Recrystallisation of 3 from THF afforded colourless crystals of the adduct 4. Synthetic methodology for the first FLP, (1) reported by Stephan et. al. formed from dimesityl phosphine and tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane. After reaction with Me2SiHCl to give (C6H2Me3)2PH(C6F4)BH(C6F5)2 (2), the resulting dihydride will thermally decompose to release hydrogen gas and the neutral compound 3. Using THF as a donor solvent afforded white colourless crystals of the adduct molecule 4. =Other small molecule substrates= FLPs are also reactive toward many unsaturated substrates beyond H2. Some FLPs react with CO2, specifically in the deoxygenative reduction of CO2 to methane. Ethylene also reacts with FLPs: :PCy3 + B(C6F5)3 + C2H4 -> Cy3P+CH2CH2B^{-}(C6F5)3 For acid-base pairs to behave both nucleophilically and electrophilically at the same time offers a method for the ring-opening of cyclic ethers such as THF, 2,5-dihydrofuran, coumaran, and dioxane.  Use in catalysis = Imine, nitrile and aziridine hydrogenation = 276x276px Reduction of imines, nitriles, and aziridines to primary and secondary amines traditionally is effected by metal hydride reagents, e.g. lithium aluminium hydride and sodium cyanoborohydride. Hydrogenations of these unsaturated substrates can be effected by metal- catalyzed reactions. Metal-free catalytic hydrogenation was carried out using the phosphonium borate catalyst (R2PH)(C6F4)BH(C6F5)2 (R = 2,4,6-Me3C6H2) 1. This type of metal-free hydrogenation has the potential to replace high cost metal catalyst. The mechanism of imine reduction is proposed to involve protonation at nitrogen giving the iminium salt. The basicity of the nitrogen centre determines the rate of reaction. More electron rich imines reduce at faster rates than electron poor imines. The resulting iminium center undergoes nucleophilic attack by the borohydride anion to form the amine. Small amines bind to the borane, quenching further reactions. This problem can be overcome using various methods: 1) Application of elevated temperatures 2) Using sterically bulky imine substituents 3) Protecting the imine with the B(C6F5)3group, which also serves as a Lewis acid promoter. = Enantioselective imine hydrogenation = Chiral boronate Lewis acid derived from (1R)-(+)-camphor form a frustrated Lewis pair with tBu3P, which is isolable as a salt. This FLP catalyses the enantioselective hydrogenation of some aryl imines in high yield but modest ee (up to 83%). center Although conceptually interesting, the protocol suffers from lack of generality. It was found that increasing steric bulk of the imine substituents lead to decreased yield and ee of the amine product. methoxy-substituted imines exhibit to superior yield and ee's. =Asymmetric hydrosilylations= A group of catalysts, Frustrated Lewis pairs of chiral alkenylboranes and phosphines are beneficial for asymmetric Piers-type hydrosilylations of 1,2-dicarbonyl compounds and alpha-keto Esters, resulting in products of high yield enantioselectivity. However, in comparison conventional Piers-type hydrosilyation, asymmetric Piers-type hydrosilylations are not as well developed In the following example, the chiral alkenylborane is formed in situ from chiral diyne and the HB(C6F5)2. Heterolytic cleavage of Si-H bond from PhMe2SiH by the FLP catalyst, forms a silylium and hydridoborate ionic complex. Asymmetric Hydrosilylation of a Diketone by an FLP = Alkyne hydrogenation = Metal free hydrogenation of unactivated internal alkynes to cis-alkenes is readily achieved using FLP-based catalysts. The condition for this reaction were relatively mild utilising 2 bar of H2. In terms of mechanism, the alkyne material is first hydroborated and then the resulting vinylborane-based FLP can then activate dihydrogen. A protodeborylation step releases the cis-alkene product, which is obtained due to the syn- hydroborylation process, and regenerating the catalyst. While active for alkyne hydrogenation the FLP-based catalysts do not however facilitate the hydrogenation of alkenes to alkanes. Mechanism for hydrogenation of alkynes using FLPsThe reaction is a syn-hydroboration, and as a result a high cis selectivity is observed. At the final stage of the catalytic cycle the C6F5 group is cleaved more easily than an alkyl group, causing catalyst degradation rather than alkane release. The catalytic cycle has three steps: * Substrate binding (the hydroboration of alkyne) * H2 cleavage with vinylborane, followed by intramolecular protodeborylation of vinyl substituent, recovering N,N-Dimethyl-2-[(pentafluorophenyl)boryl]aniline * Release of the cis-alkene Binding of terminal alkyne to the FLP catalyst With internal alkynes, a competitive reaction occurs where the proton bound to the nitrogen can be added to the fluorobenzenes. Therefore, this addition does not proceed that much, the formation of the alkene seems favoured. But terminal alkynes do not bind to the boron through hydroboration but rather through C-H activation. Thus, the addition of the proton to the alkyne will result in the initial terminal alkyne. Hence this hydrogenation process is not suitable to terminal alkynes and will only give pentafluorobenzene. The metal free hydrogenation of terminal alkynes to the respective alkenes was recently achieved using a pyridone borane based system. This system activates hydrogen readily at room temperature yielding a pyridone borane complex. Dissociation of this complex allows hydroboration of an alkyne by the free borane. Upon protodeborylation by the free pyridone the cis alkene is generated. Hydrogenation of terminal alkynes is possible with this system, because the C-H activation is reversible and competes with hydrogen activation. = Borylation = Amine-borane FLPs catalyse the borylation of electron-rich aromatic heterocycles (Scheme 1). The reaction is driven by release of hydrogen via C-H activation by the FLP. Aromatic borylations are often used in pharmaceutical development, particularly due to the abundance, low cost and low toxicity of boron compounds compared to noble metals., Scheme 1: Mechanism for borylation catalysed by FLPThe substrate for the reaction has two main requirements, strongly linked to the mechanism of borylation. First, the substrate must be electron rich, exemplified by the absence of a reaction with thiophene, whereas its more electron rich derivatives - methoxythiophene and 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene - can undergo a reaction with the amino-borane. Furthermore, substitution of 1-methylpyrrole (which can react) with the strongly electron withdrawing tertbutyloxycarbonyl (Boc) group at the 2-position completely inhibits the reaction. The second requirement is for the absence of basic amine groups in the substrate, which would otherwise form an unwanted adduct. This can be illustrated by the lack of a reaction with pyrrole, whereas both 1-methyl and N-benzylpyrrole derivatives are able to react. Further work by the same authors revealed that simply piperidine as the amine R group (as opposed to tetramethylpiperidine, pictured above) accelerated the rate of reaction. Through kinetic and DFT studies the authors proposed that the C-H activation step was more facile than with larger substituents. Dearomatisation can also be achieved under similar conditions but using N-tosyl indoles. Syn-hyrdoborylated indolines are obtained. Deromatisation of N-tosyl indole by HBpin Borylation of S-H bonds in thiols by a dehydrogenative process has also been observed. Alcohols and amines such as tert-Butanol and tert-Butylamine form stable products that prevent catalysis due to a strong œÄ-bond between the N/O atom‚Äôs lone pair and boron, whereas the same is not true for thiols, thus allowing for successful catalysis. In addition, successful borylation of Se-H bonds has been achieved. In all cases, the formation of H2 gas is a strong driving force for the reactions.  Carbon capture  FLP chemistry is conceptually relevant to carbon capture. Both an intermolecular (Scheme 1) and intramolecular (Scheme 2) FLP consisting of a phosphine and a borane were used to selectively capture and release carbon dioxide. When a solution of the FLP was covered by an atmosphere of CO2 at room temperature, the FLP-CO2 compound immediately precipitated as a white solid. Scheme 1: Intermolecular FLP CO2 capture and release. Heating the intermolecular FLP-CO2 compound in bromobenzene at 80 ¬∞C under vacuum for 5 hours caused the release of around half of the CO2 and regenerating the two constituent components of the FLP. After several more hours of sitting at room temperature under vacuum, total release of CO2 and FLP regeneration had occurred. Scheme 2: Intramolecular FLP CO2 capture and release. The intramolecular FLP-CO2 compound by contrast was stable as a solid at room temperature but fully decomposed at temperatures above -20 ¬∞C as a solution in dichloromethane releasing CO2 and regenerating the FLP molecule. This method of FLP carbon capture can be adapted to work in flow chemistry systems.

The racial makeup of the MSA was 80.40% White, 14.90% African American, 0.20% Native American, 1.80% Asian, 0.01% Pacific Islander, 0.80% from other races, and 2.00% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.90% of the population. The median income for a household in the MSA was $47,381, and the median income for a family was $59,770. Males had a median income of $38,430 versus $26,205 for females. The per capita income for the MSA was $25,436. From the 2000 Census to the 2010 Census, the Dayton region has seen a shift in population from its urban core to more out-lying affluent suburbs. This is evidenced by a 10% growth in population in Englewood, a 19% population growth in Beavercreek, and a 40% population growth in Springboro. Smaller growths in the 2010 census in the Dayton area included Miamisburg, Centerville, Vandalia, and Fairborn. Many of Dayton's suburbs that saw declines in populations fared well from 2000 to 2010. Dayton's largest suburb, Kettering for example, only saw a 2.3% decline during the ten-year period and Huber Heights, Dayton's third largest suburb, saw a 0.3% decline in population. The Dayton Metropolitan Statistical Area formerly included Clark County and Preble County. In 2005, Clark County containing Springfield, Ohio separated from the Dayton MSA to create their own MSA named Springfield Metropolitan Statistical Area. As a result of new Census criteria to delineate metropolitan areas, Preble County was eliminated from the MSA in 2013 as it no longer qualified for inclusion. A significant drop in population for the Dayton MSA is noted in the 2010 census because of these changes.

Lindstrom (June 8, 1915 - January 8, 1998) was an American sociologist specializing in popular culture and demography who spent over four decades, starting in 1953, as professor (later professor emeritus) of sociology at Arizona State University. A Massachusetts native, Lindstrom was born in the town of Palmer, located within the Springfield metropolitan area. His family background was mixed, including Swedish, German-Jewish, and other European forebears; he received a secular upbringing. He attended the University of Chicago, receiving his A.B. in 1938 and A.M. in 1941. Following service in World War II, he returned to the University on the G.I. Bill, earning his Ph.D. in 1950. After teaching for three years at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, he relocated to Arizona, where he chaired the ASU Department of Sociology for a record number of years. He also served multiple terms as Secretary-Treasurer of the Pacific Sociological Association (PSA). Lindstrom was considered to incarnate the outlook and practices of the Chicago school, of which he was a historian, contributing to the special issue of the journal Sociological Perspectives (Vol. 31, No. 3, July 1988) entitled Waving the Flag for Old Chicago. With his wife, Laura Johnson, and Ronald A. Hardert, he edited the 1995 book Kimball Young on Sociology in Transition, 1912-1968\\\\. As a student of popular culture, he maintained an extensive collection of jazz and blues records, ranging from 78s to CDs, and frequently offered a course entitled The Sociology of Jazz and Blues. His official area of specialization, however, was demography. Before serving in the war, he had specialized in literature--after his change of academic field, he was involved with sociology of the arts and the teaching of sociology through literature. In 1994 he received a distinguished service award from ASU's College of Liberal Arts. Frederick B. Lindstrom died at the age of 82. He and his wife Laura were the parents of three children--two sons and daughter Naomi, a literary critic specializing in Latin America, with whom he co-authored conference papers and articles.

At this date the district had only one mission station, Jaipur. Besides this, a Catholic priest resided at Ajmer in charge of a small community of Eurasians and Goans, and there were also stations for troops at Nasirabad, Neemuch, and Mhow, served by three military chaplains. After the carrival of French Capuchins, other stations were established at Ratlam, Thandla, Mariapur, Jhabua, Jhalrapatan, Parbatpura, and Bhawanikhera.

Looney Tunes animated short directed by Robert McKimson. The short was released on July 7, 1956, and stars Daffy Duck in a Superman spoof. The voices were performed by Mel Blanc and Daws Butler; Butler -- who voiced the narrator and the newspaper editor -- was uncredited.  Synopsis  Daffy Duck is cast as Stupor Duck and his alter ego, Cluck Trent. The cartoon begins as a parody of the opening to The Adventures of Superman, which-after introducing Stupor Duck as a \\"Strange being from another planet\\"-shows Stupor Duck being: *\\"Faster than a bullet\\" (a cork fired from a toy pop gun) *\\"More powerful than a speeding locomotive\\" (a recycled clip from Hare Trigger) *\\"Able to leap the tallest building\\" (the depicted tall building called the \\"McKimson Associates\\" building [sic], with Stupor Duck's cape catching on the flagpole at the very top, causing Daffy to nearly choke) After the parodied introduction, the film proceeds to the story: Mild-mannered newspaper reporter Cluck Trent, taking a break from writing, overhears a conversation coming from his editor's office. The one-sided conversation is from a villain on a \\"corny soap opera\\" the editor is watching on TV. The unseen soap's villain calls himself \\"Aardvark Ratnik,\\" a Russian-accented terrorist bent on world domination. Ratnik supposedly threatens widespread destruction (though his demands are never heard); his first line, after a maniacal laugh, is \\"You cannot stop me, Mr. Newspaper Editor!\\", which leads Cluck to the erroneous conclusion that Ratnik actually exists, his threats are serious, and that stopping him is a job for Stupor Duck. Cluck runs to the broom closet to change into his alter-ego (after an errant change into a witch's costume, and then a minor adjustment to Stupor Duck's shoulder pads) and begins his search for the non-existent antagonist. One by one, Stupor Duck spots \\"examples\\" of \\"Aardvark's\\" supposed work and, before tackling each one, bellowing his battle cry, \\"THIS is a job for STU-U-U-POR Duck!\\". His search includes: *A skyscraper being destroyed. Stupor Duck pushes the building back upright, not knowing it was to be demolished and replace with a new city hall; he is punched out by the site foreman (\\"Then the lights went out all over the world!\\"). *A sinking ship, which was actually a submarine conducting war games. Stupor Duck pulls the sub back to the surface and is first shot by its deck gun; when he dares \\"Ratnik\\" to try that again, Stupor Duck is promptly blown up and sunk by one of the sub's torpedoes. *A dynamite charge at the base of a railroad trestle as a train runs over it. It turned out to be a Warner Brothers location shoot. Stupor Duck grabs the dynamite and heads skyward, and is blown up {off-screen} by the unknowing explosives expert. The expert is abruptly showered with black feathers as the \\"S\\" shield from Stupor Duck's costume softly lands in his hand; a featherless and disgruntled Daffy walks up and grabs the shield saying, \\"I'll just relieve you of that, if you don't mind\\". *Lastly, Stupor Duck hears a siren while unknowingly flying over government testing grounds. He spots what he believes to be an armed warhead, but is actually a government moon rocket. Right after Stupor Duck lands on the nose cone to try to stop it, the rocket launches into space, leaving behind Stupor Duck's costume in its wake. As the rocket hurtles skyward, two rock climbers see it and shout \\"Up there in the sky! It's a bird! It's a plane! It's STU-U-UPOR Duck!\\" The final shot is of the now-naked Daffy screaming, still clinging to the rocket for dear life at it streaks toward the moon.

It was released in the United Kingdom and Ireland as Summer Manoeuvres, and in the United States under the title The Grand Maneuver. It is a romantic comedy-drama set in a French provincial town just before World War I, and it was Ren√© Clair's first film to be made in colour. Plot Armand de la Verne, a lieutenant in the French cavalry and a notorious seducer, undertakes a bet that he will \\"obtain the favours\\" of a woman selected secretly by lot, before his company departs for its summer manoeuvres in a month's time. His target turns out to be Marie- Louise Rivi√®re, a Parisian divorc√©e who runs a milliner's shop, and who is also being courted by the serious and respectable Victor Duverger. Marie Louise's growing attraction towards Armand is tempered by her discoveries about his reputation, while Armand's calculated strategy becomes undermined by his genuine emotions. A subplot follows the parallel but simpler courtship of Armand's friend and fellow officer F√©lix and Lucie, the young daughter of a photographer.

(New York: Orion Press, 1970). p.323. The film is set in a French garrison town in the period just before the First World War, the end of the Belle √âpoque. Describing the origins of the film, Clair said, \\"Having passed a part of my childhood near Versailles, I could not forget the cavalry officers, their galloping in the forest of Viroflay, the rumors of their adventures, a duel which the newspapers talked about and in which two of those officers died....\\"Ren√© Clair, Four Screenplays; translated from the French by Piergiuseppe Bozzetti. (New York: Orion Press, 1970). p.436. Elsewhere he commented, \\"For me it is a very sentimental film, even more sentimental because it is situated in the period of my childhood. I put into it things that I saw.\\"Michel Aubriant & Herv√© Le Boterf, \\"Entretien avec Ren√© Clair\\", in Cin√©monde, 2 mai 1957, p.33; quoted in translation by Celia McGerr, Ren√© Clair. (Boston: Twayne, 1980). p.199. Clair's aim was to create a portrait of provincial life in the years before 1914, and close attention was paid to the fashions of the period and the rituals of military life.Georges Charensol & Roger R√©gent, 50 Ans de cin√©ma avec Ren√© Clair. (Paris: √âditions de la Table Ronde, 1979). p.178.Pierre Billard, Le Myst√®re Ren√© Clair. (Paris: Plon, 1998). p.356. Les Grandes Man≈ìuvres was Clair's first film in colour, a medium he had wanted to use since his time in England in the late 1930s, because, he stated, \\"it would enable him to keep reality at a distance\\"\\"...[il] proclame qu'elle lui servira √† s'√©loigner de la r√©alit√©\\": Pierre Billard, Le Myst√®re Ren√© Clair. (Paris: Plon, 1998). p.356. The production designer, L√©on Barsacq, created sets in which muted colours were dominant, with furniture and accessories in black or white, and costumes mainly in beige or brown; they even sprayed the leaves of trees with yellow so that their shade of green would not be too bright. The only bold colour permitted was red, the red of the military uniforms. The film's budget was 222 million old francs; of this, Clair's salary was 20 million and G√©rard Philipe's was 18 million.Pierre Billard, Le Myst√®re Ren√© Clair. (Paris: Plon, 1998). p.3. Filming began at the Studios de Boulogne on 28 April 1955, and continued until 2 July, after which the film was completed rapidly; editing had been largely determined during shooting, with few alternative shots being taken.Pierre Billard, Le Myst√®re Ren√© Clair. (Paris: Plon, 1998). p.358; p.440. However, Clair hesitated between different endings for the film, two of which were actually filmed and shown to groups of friends to gauge their reaction. Although several favoured the more bitter and tragic ending, Clair adopted the one that was more delicate and low-key, as being more in keeping with his own manner.Pierre Billard, Le Myst√®re Ren√© Clair. (Paris: Plon, 1998). p.358. Even so, it was the first of his films which \\"ended badly\\", and thus marked a departure in his style. Reception The first screening of Les Grandes Man≈ìuvres took place in Moscow, on 17 October 1955, as part of the first \\"French Film Week\\" (Semaine du cin√©ma fran√ßais). (This provoked one attack in a French newspaper which criticised its selection for the USSR because it suggested that the French army had nothing better to do than to pursue female conquests. Clair had fuelled this complaint by declaring at his Moscow press conference that in life there was nothing more serious than love.)Pierre Billard, Le Myst√®re Ren√© Clair. (Paris: Plon, 1998). p.361-362. The French premi√®re took place in Paris on 26 October 1955, and was generally well received by both press and public.Georges Charensol & Roger R√©gent, 50 Ans de cin√©ma avec Ren√© Clair. (Paris: √âditions de la Table Ronde, 1979). p.181. Those critics who were less than enthusiastic were at any rate respectful. Several of Clair's longtime supporters thought that it was his best film.Georges Charensol and Georges Sadoul, quoted in Pierre Billard, Le Myst√®re Ren√© Clair. (Paris: Plon, 1998). p.361-362; Jean de Baroncelli, writing in Le Monde: \\"Un enchantement. Un ravissement\\"; quoted by Georges Charensol & Roger R√©gent, 50 Ans de cin√©ma avec Ren√© Clair. (Paris: √âditions de la Table Ronde, 1979). p.181. One of the few hostile reactions came from Claude Mauriac who objected that the performance of G√©rard Philipe made a sympathetic character out of a complaisant seducer.Claude Mauriac, \\"Lovelace et Iseult\\", in Le Figaro litt√©raire. 5 November 1955; quoted by Pierre Billard, Le Myst√®re Ren√© Clair. (Paris: Plon, 1998). p.361-362. Andr√© Bazin observed that the film was \\"like those classics which do not claim originality in their material, only in the manner in which they move the pieces on the chess-board.... Les Grandes Man≈ìuvres begins as vaudeville, continues as comedy, reaches drama, and culminates in tragedy.\\"Andr√© Bazin, \\"L'Univers de Ren√© Clair\\", in L'√âducation nationale, 10 November 1955; quoted by Pierre Billard, Le Myst√®re Ren√© Clair. (Paris: Plon, 1998). p.363-364. A positive review by Jacques Doniol-Valcroze appeared in France-Observateur in November 1955 in which he wrote that everything about the film reminded him of an operetta: \\"We smile, laugh, are astonished, smile again and feel our hearts ache [-] it would be a mistake to underestimate Les Grandes Manoeuvres, as I understand some people have.\\" Quoted in Jean Douchet, French New Wave. (New York: D.A.P, 1999). p.27. The film won two important French prizes, the Prix Louis-Delluc and the Prix M√©li√®s. Among English-language reviewers, there was consistency in their appreciation of Clair's wit and the visual elegance of his use of colour on the one hand, but on the other a disappointment at his perceived failure to bring sufficient emotional engagement to the film's later scenes. In the words of one British review, Les Grandes Man≈ìuvres was \\"an exceptionally finished and civilised entertainment [and] not the least of its assets is the impeccable taste with which Clair, for the first time, manipulates colour\\"; but, \\"in negotiating the change to a serious ending, the film is less than wholly satisfactory\\".\\"Les Grandes Man≈ìuvres (Summer Manoeuvres)\\", in Monthly Film Bulletin, Feb. 1956, pp.15-16. Another said, \\"The film begins beautifully... The gently stylised movements, the light and even rhythm, set [Clair's] own personal tone of comedy.... Later developments, however, demand more than he seems prepared to give... it fails to convey human passions suddenly taking over.\\"Gavin Lambert, \\"Les Grandes Man≈ìuvres\\", in Sight & Sound, vol.25(3), Winter 1955/56, pp.146-147. This was echoed by an American reviewer: \\"[Clair] has shown true artistry in his use of pastel and vivid hues to capture even the nuances of dress, d√©cor and elegance of a pre- World War I garrison town.... [The film] is a fragile and compassionate but rarely moving delineation of the grand passion.\\"A.H. Weiler, \\"The Grand Maneuver\\", in The New York Times, 2 October 1956. Retrieved 11 August 2012. An Irish review agreed that, \\"Rene Clair's Summer Manoeuvres is anything but a deeply \\"committed\\" film, and survives chiefly for its evocation of period.... [The film] does not quite compass the violent change from manners to passion...\\".Peter Connolly, review, in The Furrow (Maynooth, Ireland), Vol. 7, No. 11 (Nov. 1956), pp. 693-697. Retrieved 19 July 2012. A more sympathetic summary appeared in The Times: \\"Les Grandes Manoeuvres is a sigh for lost youth, for a lost generation, and for, perhaps, l'amour, as against love, and its only failing is that, in enchanting the senses, it fails to touch the heart.\\"\\"Les Grandes Manoeuvres\\", in The Times (London), 10 January 1956, p.5, col.3. In 1974, the film was given an out-of-competition screening at the Cannes Film Festival. Clair himself considered Les Grandes Man≈ìuvres (along with Le silence est d'or) to be the best of his post-war films.Celia McGerr, Ren√© Clair. (Boston: Twayne, 1980). p.199. However, it appeared at a time when the classical studio-bound style of French cinema which Clair represented was coming under attack from a new generation of French critics and filmmakers, and henceforth his films were generally less well received.David Thomson, A New Biographical Dictionary of Film. (London: Little, Brown, 2002). p.161.

He served as a Professor of Political Economy of the University of Toronto from 1892 to 1923. His influence upon Canadian economic thought is traced to as late as the 1970s. He played a key role in resettling Doukhobor religious dissidents from the Russian Empire to Canada. He was also a noted arts promoter. Life and career Mavor was born in Stranraer, Scotland, to a Free Church of Scotland minister and teacher James Mavor, and Mary Ann Taylor Bridie. He studied in Glasgow University. After that he taught for some time in a Glasgow college and read special courses in Glasgow University and Edinburgh University. He was also an editor for Scottish Art Review. He also became active in the Socialist League, chairing its Scottish district. In 1892, upon the recommendation of University of Toronto Professor William Ashley who was leaving for Harvard University, he took Ashley's chair of Political Economy and Constitutional History, moving to Toronto with his family (including daughter Dora who would later become a major figure in Canada's theatre). After 1892, he spent most of his life in Toronto, leaving only for short trips. In 1893, James Mavor was a founding member of the Toronto Chapter of the Alpha Delta Phi Literary Society. At the start, he caused turmoil when he stated Canada could not serve as the only source of wheat for the British Empire as general ideology of the Empire observed it. To avoid further misunderstanding, he took the economy of Russia as his major scientific specialization. As a professor he also researched the economies of Canada, China, Korea, and Japan. In 1898 through 1899, he became a key figure in the Doukhobor immigration to Canada. His correspondent at the time was notable Russian scientist and major Anarchist ideologist Kropotkin, at that time living in the UK, who proposed that Doukhobor peasantry, numbering several thousand people, be settled in Canada. Through several years that followed, he took a keen interest in the Doukhobor cause, siding with them in cases of conflict with Canadian authorities. Kropotkin warmly regarded Mavor as a friend and later recalled that Mavor was \\"a living encyclopedia of Canadian economics.\\" As an arts activist, Mavor helped organize several Canadian art venues, such as the Art Gallery of Ontario and the Royal Ontario Museum. He published articles and statistics for the Canadian government regarding immigration, wheat production, and workers' healthcare compensation. In 1914, he published the first edition of his magnum opus, An Economic History of Russia, in two volumes. This publication earned him membership in the Royal Society of Canada. After over 30 years of teaching economy, he became professor emeritus and retired in 1923.Canadiana ‚Äî –û—Ç–¥–µ–ª –†—É–∫–æ–ø–∏—Å–µ–π –£–Ω–∏–≤–µ—Ä—Å–∏—Ç–µ—Ç–∞ –¢–æ—Ä–æ–Ω—Ç–æ After he left, the University of Toronto for some time discontinued the tradition of extensive Russian studies he and William Ashley founded.

This corresponds in general to the fastest and most efficient way to reach the desired target orientation as there is only one acceleration phase and one braking phase for the angular rate. If this fixed axis is not a principal axis a time varying torque must be applied to force the spacecraft to rotate as desired, though. Also the gyroscopic effect of momentum wheels must be compensated for. That such a rotation exists corresponds precisely to a main result of the mathematical theory of rotation operators, the (only real) eigenvector of the rotation operator corresponding to the desired re- orientation is this axis. Given the current orientation of the craft, and the desired orientation of the craft in cartesian coordinates, the required axis of rotation and corresponding rotation angle to achieve the new orientation is determined by computing the eigenvector of the rotation operator.  Problem  Let :\\\\hat{x}\\\\ ,\\\\ \\\\hat{y}\\\\ ,\\\\ \\\\hat{z} be a body fixed reference system for a 3 axis stabilized spacecraft. The initial attitude is given by :\\\\hat{x}=\\\\hat{a} :\\\\hat{y}=\\\\hat{b} :\\\\hat{z}=\\\\hat{c}. One wants to find an axis relative the spacecraft body :\\\\hat{r}=r_x \\\\cdot \\\\hat{x} +r_y \\\\cdot \\\\hat{y} +r_z \\\\cdot \\\\hat{z} and a rotation angle \\\\alpha such that after the rotation with the angle \\\\alpha one has that :\\\\hat{x}=\\\\hat{d} :\\\\hat{y}=\\\\hat{e} :\\\\hat{z}=\\\\hat{f} where :\\\\hat{d}\\\\ ,\\\\ \\\\hat{e}\\\\ ,\\\\ \\\\hat{f} are the new target directions. In vector form this means that :\\\\hat{d}=r_a \\\\cdot \\\\hat{r} + \\\\cos \\\\alpha \\\\cdot ( \\\\hat{a} - r_a \\\\cdot \\\\hat{r})+ \\\\sin \\\\alpha \\\\cdot \\\\hat{r} \\\\times \\\\hat{a} :\\\\hat{e}=r_b \\\\cdot \\\\hat{r} + \\\\cos \\\\alpha \\\\cdot ( \\\\hat{b} - r_b \\\\cdot \\\\hat{r})+ \\\\sin \\\\alpha \\\\cdot \\\\hat{r} \\\\times \\\\hat{b} :\\\\hat{f}=r_c \\\\cdot \\\\hat{r} + \\\\cos \\\\alpha \\\\cdot ( \\\\hat{c} - r_c \\\\cdot \\\\hat{r})+ \\\\sin \\\\alpha \\\\cdot \\\\hat{r} \\\\times \\\\hat{c}.  Solution  In terms of linear algebra this means that one wants to find an eigenvector with the eigenvalue = 1 for the linear mapping defined by :\\\\hat{a} \\\\longrightarrow \\\\hat{d} :\\\\hat{b} \\\\longrightarrow \\\\hat{e} :\\\\hat{c} \\\\longrightarrow \\\\hat{f} which relative to the :\\\\hat{a}\\\\ ,\\\\ \\\\hat{b}\\\\ ,\\\\ \\\\hat{c} coordinate system has the matrix :\\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\langle \\\\hat{d} \\\\hat{a}\\\\rangle & \\\\langle\\\\hat{e} \\\\hat{a}\\\\rangle & \\\\langle\\\\hat{f} \\\\hat{a} \\\\rangle \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\langle\\\\hat{d} \\\\hat{b}\\\\rangle & \\\\langle\\\\hat{e} \\\\hat{b}\\\\rangle & \\\\langle\\\\hat{f} \\\\hat{b}\\\\rangle \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\langle\\\\hat{d} \\\\hat{c}\\\\rangle & \\\\langle\\\\hat{e} \\\\hat{c}\\\\rangle & \\\\langle\\\\hat{f} \\\\hat{c}\\\\rangle \\\\end{bmatrix} Because this is the matrix of the rotation operator relative the base vector system \\\\hat{a}\\\\ ,\\\\ \\\\hat{b}\\\\ ,\\\\ \\\\hat{c} the eigenvalue can be determined with the algorithm described in \\"Rotation operator (vector space)\\". With the notations used here this is: :\\\\cos \\\\alpha=\\\\frac{\\\\langle\\\\hat{d} \\\\hat{a}\\\\rangle+\\\\langle\\\\hat{e} \\\\hat{b}\\\\rangle+\\\\langle\\\\hat{f} \\\\hat{c}\\\\rangle-1}{2} :r_a=\\\\langle\\\\hat{f} \\\\hat{b}\\\\rangle-\\\\langle\\\\hat{e} \\\\hat{c}\\\\rangle :r_b=\\\\langle\\\\hat{d} \\\\hat{c}\\\\rangle-\\\\langle\\\\hat{f} \\\\hat{a}\\\\rangle :r_c=\\\\langle\\\\hat{e} \\\\hat{a}\\\\rangle-\\\\langle\\\\hat{d} \\\\hat{b}\\\\rangle :\\\\bar{r}=\\\\sqrt{{r_a}^2+{r_b}^2+{r_c}^2} :\\\\sin \\\\alpha=\\\\frac{\\\\bar{r}}{2} The rotation angle \\\\alpha is :\\\\alpha=\\\\operatorname{arg}(\\\\cos \\\\alpha,\\\\sin \\\\alpha) where \\"\\\\operatorname{arg}(x\\\\ ,\\\\ y)\\" is the polar argument of the vector (\\\\ x\\\\ ,\\\\ y\\\\ ) corresponding to the function ATAN2(y,x) (or in double precision DATAN2(y,x)) available in for example the programming language FORTRAN.

Close to the Argentine president Juan Per√≥n, and a chief representative of the \\"syndical bureaucracy\\" (the trade-union movement's right wing); he was assassinated in 1973. Trade unionist career The son of modest Italian immigrants, he was born in Alcorta, Santa Fe Province, and emigrated to Buenos Aires as a young man to find work. He became a steelworker in the La Ballester-Molina weapons' factory. There, he met Hilario Salvo, leader of the recently founded Uni√≥n Obrera Metal√∫rgica (UOM) steelworkers' union.Jos√© Ignacio Rucci, El precio de la lealtad, review of Lu√≠s Fernando Beraza's biography of Rucci (Vergara, 2007) by Soles Digital, 10 December 2007 Rucci was present on Plaza de Mayo, as well as thousands of workers, on 17 October 1945, a historical date in Peronism. Elected trade union delegate for the first time in 1947, he retained this function until 1953. Following the self-styled Revoluci√≥n Libertadora, a military coup which ousted Per√≥n in 1955, Rucci progressively acquired fame by participating in the Peronist Resistance movement, and was jailed several times for breaching decree 4,161, which proscribed the very mention of Per√≥n's name. Following the creation of the 62 Organizations, the political branch of the CGT, to which he ascribed, Rucci quickly progressed inside the unions' hierarchy, alongside fellow UOM leader Augusto Vandor. At first a unionist leader in the SOMISA steelworking factory in San Nicol√°s de los Arroyos (the nation's largest), he assumed the post of press secretary of the UOM in 1960, and sat on its board of directors alongside Vandor, Paulino Niembro, Avelino Fern√°ndez and Lorenzo Miguel. He was named inspector in 1964 for the San Nicol√°s de los Arroyos union local, where he later became the general secretary. Rucci strongly opposed the unionist Agust√≠n Tosco, the leader of the C√≥rdoba trade union Luz y Fuerza, who held a more leftist position than Rucci, and opposed the syndical bureaucracy's \\"participationist\\" (pragmatic) stance towards the military government of General Juan Carlos Ongan√≠a, installed in 1966.  General secretary of the CGT  The CGT split into the conservative Azopardo branch (named after the headquarters' address in Buenos Aires), and the CGT de los Argentinos (CGTA) following the annulment of left-wing graphist workers' leader Raimundo Ongaro as secretary general. The eventual Cordobazo of May 1969 led to the CGT-Azopardo's placement in receivership (the CGTA had been banned from the start), though in December, the order was lifted.Potash, Robert. The Army and Politics in Argentina. Stanford University Press, 1996. Displacing Jos√© Alonso in July 1970, Rucci was elected general secretary of the CGT, by 544 delegates on 618 present, during the Normalization Congress, which led to deepened differences between the CGT-Azopardo and the CGTA, which claimed a more radical leftist stance opposed to the military junta. Among those 618 delegates present at the Congress, 544 voted for him; those who voted against were the Vandoristas, on the right-wing (Vandor had spoken in favour of a \\"Peronism without Per√≥n\\", supporting the \\"participationist\\" tendency among the workers' movement), and the Cordobeses, who were in favour of armed struggle against the junta As the new general secretary of the CGT (hereafter CGT-Azopardo), Rucci launched the slogan \\"Nothing Without Per√≥n\\" (Nada sin Per√≥n) and, after initial optimism, opposed President Alejandro Lanusse's National Accords (Gran Acuerdo Nacional) of July 1971, which outlined a road map to the return to democratic rule, but which preserved the military's vetting power over policy. This helped unite Peronist forces towards the goal of Per√≥n's return from exile. Privately, however, Rucci maintained contacts in the Lanusse regime, and lobbied against repeated wage freeze proposals. Hosting Lanusse in an April 1971 summit with the CGT, Rucci persuaded the president to begin negotiations with Per√≥n and other political leaders, and to return the late Eva Per√≥n's remains to Argentina. At least as powerful a symbol among Peronists as the leader himself, Evita had been ordered hidden in Milan by the regime that overthrew Per√≥n in 1955, and their repatriation would buy all concerned in the negotiations time. Ongoing delays and the failure of the National Accords led Rucci to public threats of a general strike, while maintaining his contacts with Lanusse, and giving Per√≥n the opportunity appear magnanimous by urging against them. Privately, however, he came to doubt that the aging Per√≥n would return in time to run again for office, and began exploring a \\"syndicalist-military option,\\" by which Lanusse would call elections, and the CGT would back an amenable candidate from within the armed forcesmost likely Lanusse's labor liaison, General Tom√°s S√°nchez de Bustamante. Ultimately, Lanusse agreed to elections, and allow Per√≥n to visit Argentina in preparations. He arrived on November 17, 1972, and secured a number of alliances for the upcoming March 1973 elections. Rucci provided a lasting anecdote on the occasion when, during a strong rain, he greeted Per√≥n as the latter deplaned, and spontaneously opened his umbrella to shield the aging leader. Elected by a landslide, Per√≥n's stand-in, Dr. H√©ctor C√°mpora's, took office with a left-wing agenda opposed by Rucci, much of the syndical apparatus, and Per√≥n's influential chief of staff, Jos√© L√≥pez Rega. C√°mpora allowed Peronism's \\"Revolutionary Tendency\\" faction the pick of several cabinet positions and other significant government posts. Per√≥n, in tuth, insisted on the right-wing L√≥pez Rega's appointment as the Minister of Social Welfare (controlling 30% of the national budget).Rock, David. Argentina, 1516-1982. University of California Press, 1987. Making inflation reduction a top policy priority, Economy Minister Jos√© Ber Gelbard implemented the Social Pact, which Rucci signed with the Confederaci√≥n General Econ√≥mica (CGE) representing management. The agreement, which proposed a price freeze and an increase of wages, was opposed both by the Peronist Left and by the employers' organizations, who claimed it went against free market precepts. Although Rucci was depicted by the Peronist Left as part of the Syndical Bureaucracy, according to the author Berzaba, he received no support, from either L√≥pez Rega, UOM leader Lorenzo Miguel (a top Syndical Bureaucracy figure), or even Gelbard, once the latter had obtained his signature on the Social Pact. Per√≥n himself returned to Argentina on June 20, three weeks after C√°mpora's inaugural. Rucci, Miguel and other syndicalist figures organized the tribune from which Per√≥n was to address the hundreds of thousands of supporters gathered near Ezeiza Airport. Hours before the scheduled landing, snipers following orders from L√≥pez Rega shot at leftists in the crowd from the tribune. The ensuing Ezeiza Massacre irreparably split Peronists between the revolutionary left wing and the right wing. The latter's benefactor, L√≥pez Rega, would increasingly wield influence through Per√≥n's neophyte wife, Isabel. Final days The murder of Rucci, September 25, 1973. In the context of increased social conflicts and worsening tensions, Rucci's personal secretary, Osvaldo Bianculli, was assassinated, after which Rucci moved into the CGT's cramped headquarters in an attempt to protect his life. He was increasingly isolated and well aware of the threats on his life.Interview with Rucci (1972) , Revista Gente, on-line by El Historiador Following snap elections in September, which resulted in Per√≥n's return to high office, Rucci returned to his Flores neighborhood home. As he approached his car on the morning of September 25, he was ambushed, and shot twenty-three times. An infamous detail is that he was shot twenty-three times and his body was found in front of a poster for the Traviatta crackers, which were known for having twenty-three small holes punched through them. This led to Rucci being mockingly nicknamed \\"Traviatta\\" by some political sectors. Allegedly led by a Montoneros operative known as \\"Roqu√©,\\" the commando operation had not been agreed to by the entire leadership of the far-left Montoneros. Carlos Hobert, one of its senior leaders, learned of the assassination by the radio. Some, such as El Barba Guti√©rrez, leader of the Peronist Workers' Youth, as well as Juan Carlos Dante Gullo, of the Peronist Youth, believed that Rucci had been assassinated by the CIA, in an attempt to destabilize Peronism. Per√≥n himself declared at Rucci's death: \\"They killed my son. They cut off my legs\\". After Rucci's assassination, Per√≥n went into a state of depression and his health declined further. Years later, the Montoneros' leadership unofficially recognized their responsibility in Rucci's assassination, which emotionally shook the unsentimental Per√≥n, who cried for the first time in public. The majority of the Montoneros admitted this murder, which prompted Per√≥n to support L√≥pez Rega's Triple A death squad, to be a major political mistake.Clar√≠n: Analizan una indemnizaci√≥n que ya cobr√≥ la familia Rucci  References  Bibliography  *Beraza, Lu√≠s Fernando.

After leaving the band for a protracted period of time, Saunders returned to Dexys in 2003 to perform on the tracks \\"Manhood\\" and \\"My Life in England Part One\\". Various bands In 1979, Saunders moved to London, where he drove a van for a living while playing keyboards where and when he could. During this period, he played for The Damned. He also joined The Decorators, playing on their first album Tablets. They shared a record label with the band Carmel. Inspired by the single \\"Bad Day\\", Saunders auditioned in Manchester and joined Carmel on their first album, writing the tune for the song \\"More More More\\". At the same time as playing with Carmel, he was also playing keyboards for Serious Drinking, which he describes on his website as \\"some of the most fun I've ever had in music.\\" He played on their first album, The Revolution Starts at Closing Time, and the mini album They May Be Drinkers Robin But They Are Also Human Beings. With the Drinkers, he toured the Netherlands and Germany in 1984, where the band were played on the John Peel show. Between 1985 and 1987, he played keyboards in Jake Burns and the Big Wheel. There was then a period of time without music where Saunders had a variety of jobs including decorating. In 1992, he joined the Jive Aces touring France, Germany and Switzerland with the band. Thereafter, he started playing some dinner jazz in hotels and bars and gigs with The Fallen Heroes. In 1999, he formed his own band, The New Originals. In 2005, he started working at a London burlesque/cabaret venue in Holborn, playing the piano before shows and introducing acts. This led to him putting shows together such as Blues and Burlesque. Blues and Burlesque became an independent performing group with Leah Shand a.k.a. Vicious Delicious, and Chloe Hunter a.k.a. Bouncy Hunter, putting on weekly shows at Volupte with artists such as Dusty Limits, Kitty Bang Bang, Chrys Colombine and Polly Rae, and then in other venues. In June 2012, Saunders left Volupte. In August that year, the group put on a show at the Counting House in the Edinburgh fringe festival with regular sell out shows. This was repeated in 2013 in the Blind Poet with Emma Williamson a.k.a. Scarlett Belle taking over from Chloe Hunter. In 2014, he took the Blues and Burlesque group to the Perth and Adelaide Fringe festivals where they had two sell out runs. Personal life In 2003, Saunders married Shelley Graham and later that year moved in with her in Islington.

Marsac wrote a letter to Roger Bardet asking him to visit him in prison to discuss his escape. Armed with this letter and another to Marsac‚Äôs wife, Bleicher set off for Saint-Jorioz on the banks of Lake Annecy where Peter Churchill had relocated the SPINDLE network, to meet Mme Marsac and persuaded her to come to Paris.

Henry and on his two novels. Plot Saleswoman Dulcie dreams of a better, beautiful world. Her dreams are based on the stories of writer Bill Porter, who became victim of a judicial verdict and began his literary career in prison. No special misdemeanors are attributed to him and he even enjoys the right of free movement. The administration appreciates the writer because while serving his sentence he writes beautiful stories with happy endings. Soon, however the successful writer has to face the obvious injustices going on in the prison. In particular, the writer's friend, Jim Valentine is severely beaten for politically motivated reasons. However, once Valentine is offered freedom in exchange for help in opening a safe. This proposal allows Porter to think about the imminent departure of his friend from prison. Fantasies on this topic become the basis for a new story for the writer. But the prison administration does not keep the promise and Valentine soon dies. His death is marked by a revolt of prisoners who are dissatisfied with the existing order. Dulcie's pipe dreams are also destroyed and she ends up killing her roommate. And Bill Porter comes to the conclusion that he is not able to resist the existing order but that someday another one will come.

He is best known for his time as a castaway in the Moreton Bay area, halfway up the eastern coast of Australia, in 1823. He was marooned with two others, Richard Parsons and John Finnegan, until rescued by explorer John Oxley on HMS Mermaid on 29 November of that year. They were the first white people to live in the area. They led Oxley to a large river, later named the Brisbane River. Consequently, a new colony at Moreton Bay was established in 1824. Ironically, Pamphlett, an ex-convict, committed another crime and was sentenced to seven years at the new settlement. It eventually became Brisbane, the capital of Queensland, Australia. Without Pamphlett and his fellow castaways, Brisbane might never have been founded. \\"The finding of Pamphlett\\", by J.R. Ashton, in A. Garran (ed.), Picturesque Atlas of Australasia, 1886  Transportation  Pamphlett became a brickmaker in Manchester, England. In 1810, he was charged with stealing a horse and five pieces of woollen cloth. The Justices of Assize sentenced him to 14 years' transportation to New South Wales.Criminal Register, Lancaster Criminal Hearings, 1810, Public Record Office, United Kingdom  Life as a convict  He worked at Brickfield Hill just south of the town and lived at The Rocks. On 28 May 1814, Pamphlett was charged with two others of stealing the windows from Birch Grove House, the first and only building on the Balmain Peninsula, on 13 May. His punishment was 100 lashes at the marketplace and six months in the Sydney gaol gang in double irons.Courts of Petty Sessions, Judge Advocate's Bench, 10 April 1813 to 31 December 1814, Archives Authority of New South Wales, ref.

In October, he received another 50 strokes for \\"neglect of government work\\".Monthly Returns of Punishments at Newcastle.  Commutation of sentence  On 31 January 1820, Pamphlett successfully applied to the Governor for commutation of sentence,New South Wales Colonial Secretary. In Letters, Petitions for Mitigations of Sentences, 1819-20, Petition of Pamphlett to the Governor for commutation of sentence, Archives Authority of New South Wales, ref. 4/1859, p. 79. receiving a conditional pardon. He was returned to Sydney, evidently with a wife and three children.Pamphlett's petition to the Governor is the only known record of his family. Unfortunately, their names are not given. He may have met his wife in Newcastle. A number of female convicts lived at the colony. In 1815, there were about 160 male and 40 female prisoners. Within a few years, numbers had grown significantly. By 1819, when Pamphlett left Newcastle, the convict population was around 700. They lived in the Hawkesbury River area west of Sydney, where Pamphlett worked on the river in some capacity. He was sentenced to seven years at Port Macquarie penal settlement for stealing from a house at Pitt Town in early 1822 but was let off due to \\"unsound mind\\".Prisoners Tried at the Court of Criminal Jurisdiction, Sydney, NSW, 1820-24, Archives Authority of New South Wales, ref. X820. He was also reported as \\"occasionally insane\\".The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser, 12 June 1822.  Cedar fetcher  Pamphlett and fellow \\"ticket of leave\\" convicts Richard Parsons and John Thompson, along with full convict John Finnegan, were hired by settler William Cox to fetch cedar from the Illawarra District, or the Five Islands, now known as Wollongong, south of Sydney. They set sail on their maiden voyage on 21 March 1823 in an open boat in length and in beam. On board were large quantities of pork and flour and five gallons of rum to buy cedar from the timber cutters, plus four gallons of water.John Uniacke, ‚ÄòNarrative of white men castaways on Moreton Island in 1823 discover the Brisbane River: statement by Thomas Pamphlet, 1823‚Äô, Mitchell Library ms. B1431; & in Barron Field (ed.), Geographical Memoirs on New South Wales, London, 1825, pp. 87-130. They got to within sight of Illawarra when a strong breeze blew them away from the coast. The wind became stronger, heavy rain fell and it got dark. They were blown further out to sea. It was five days before they could use any sail, and they drank the water and the rum. Prevailing winds and currents may have taken them most of the way across the Tasman Sea toward New Zealand.Chris Pearce, Through the Eyes of Thomas Pamphlett: Convict and Castaway, Boolarong Publications, Brisbane, 1993, p. 79.  Lost at sea  They were hopelessly lost. They thought they had drifted south and headed northwest to try to get back to Illawarra and Sydney. Pamphlett spotted land on their twenty-second day at sea. Before they could land, Thompson succumbed to the lack of fresh water and the elements, and collapsed and died. They kept his body on board, thinking they would be able to land and bury him, but they couldn‚Äôt find a spot free of wild surf so buried him at sea after two days.Uniacke; & Field.  Castaway  Pamphlett, Finnegan and Parsons finally landed on Moreton Island. Thinking Sydney was to the north, they set off along the beach in this direction with two sacks of flour and a few other items. They spent the next seven and a half months walking around Moreton Bay, island hopping, and following river and creek banks until they could find a way of crossing them. They lived for periods with several Aboriginal tribes who fed them fish and fernroot and thought they were the ghosts of dead kinsmen due to their pale colour. The natives took them by boat to Stradbroke Island. Here the castaways made their own canoe and got to the mainland, where they landed near what is now Cleveland. They continued their journey northwards along the waterfront in hope of reaching civilisation. It wasn't long before the trio stumbled across a large river which they were unable to cross. They trekked upstream for almost a month, weakened due to lack of good food. With only one reasonable swimmer (Pamphlett), they had to follow the banks of many of the creeks they encountered en route. Upon reaching Oxley Creek, however, they procured a canoe and attempted their first crossing of the river. The canoe was on the western bank of the creek, and was procured by Pamphlett swimming across the creek. The present Pamphlett Bridge at that spot was named for that event.Extract from account by Pamplett They used the canoe to return to the mouth of the river and continued north. They reached Bribie Island sometime between July and October 1823. While Pamphlett attended a series of organised fights with an Aboriginal friend, Parsons and Finnegan headed further north. The pair quarrelled and Finnegan returned to Bribie Island to the south. Pamphlett also returned to this spot. Parsons continued northwards.Uniacke; & Field.  Rescued  On 29 November 1823, Pamphlett and some Aboriginal people were on the beach at Bribie Island cooking the day's catch when he saw a cutter in the bay. It was explorer John Oxley who had been searching up and down the coast for a new convict settlement. Only then did Pamphlett learn that Sydney was over to the south rather than to the north. He told part of his story to crew member John Uniacke. Next day they picked up Finnegan who was returning from a tribal fight. He showed Oxley the Brisbane River while Pamphlett assisted Uniacke and others with aspects of Aboriginal culture.Uniacke; Field; & John Oxley, Field notebooks and reports, 1823, John Oxley Library. Parsons was picked up by Oxley on another trip nearly a year later.‚ÄòA curious case of shipwreck‚Äô, The Australian, 21 October 1824.  Moreton Bay convict settlement  Oxley took Pamphlett and Finnegan back to Sydney. A year and a half later, as a labourer at Portland Head west of Sydney, Pamphlett committed another crime. He stole two bags of flour, the very food that had initially kept him alive at Moreton Bay. In a further irony, he was sentenced to seven years‚Äô transportation to the new Moreton Bay penal colony,Clerk of the Peace, Quarter Sessions: Papers and Depositions, Windsor, October 1826, Archives Authority of New South Wales, ref. 4/8477, pp. 1-8. which had been set up after a favourable report on the area by Oxley,John Oxley, ‚ÄòReport of an Expedition to Survey Port Curtis, Moreton Bay, and Port Bowen‚Äô, 1823, John Oxley Library. thanks to Pamphlett and Finnegan.

Shelley started writing the story when she was 18, and the first edition was published anonymously in London on 1 January 1818, when she was 20. Her name first appeared in the second edition published in Paris in 1821. Shelley travelled through Europe in 1815 along the river Rhine in Germany stopping in Gernsheim, away from Frankenstein Castle, where two centuries before, an alchemist engaged in experiments.Hobbler, Dorthy and Thomas.

Atlanta, GA: Grove Press, 2002. pp. 110‚Äì11 She then journeyed to the region of Geneva, Switzerland, where much of the story takes place. The topics of galvanism and occult ideas were themes of conversation among her companions, particularly her lover and future husband Percy B. Shelley. In 1816, Mary, Percy and Lord Byron had a competition to see who could write the best horror story. After thinking for days, Shelley dreamt about a scientist who created life and was horrified by what he had made, inspiring the novel. Though Frankenstein is infused with elements of the Gothic novel and the Romantic movement, Brian Aldiss has argued that it should be considered the first true science fiction story. In contrast to previous stories with fantastical elements resembling those of later science fiction, Aldiss states the central character \\"makes a deliberate decision\\" and \\"turns to modern experiments in the laboratory\\" to achieve fantastic results.The Detached Retina: Aspects of SF and Fantasy by Brian Aldiss (1995), p. 78. It has had a considerable influence in literature and popular culture and spawned a complete genre of horror stories, films and plays. Since the publication of the novel, the name \\"Frankenstein\\" has often been used to refer to the monster itself.Bergen Evans, Comfortable Words, New York: Random House, 1957Bryan Garner, A Dictionary of Modern American Usage, New York, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of American English, Merriam-Webster: 2002 Summary Frankenstein is written in the form of a frame story that starts with Captain Robert Walton writing letters to his sister. It takes place at an unspecified time in the 18th century, as the letters' dates are given as \\"17‚Äî\\". In the story following the letters by Walton, the readers find that Victor Frankenstein creates a monster that brings tragedy to his life. =Captain Walton's introductory frame narrative= The novel Frankenstein is written in epistolary form, documenting a fictional correspondence between Captain Robert Walton and his sister, Margaret Walton Saville. Walton is a failed writer and captain who sets out to explore the North Pole and expand his scientific knowledge in hopes of achieving fame. During the voyage, the crew spots a dog sled driven by a gigantic figure. A few hours later, the crew rescues a nearly frozen and emaciated man named Victor Frankenstein. Frankenstein has been in pursuit of the gigantic man observed by Walton's crew. Frankenstein starts to recover from his exertion; he sees in Walton the same obsession that has destroyed him and recounts a story of his life's miseries to Walton as a warning. The recounted story serves as the frame for Frankenstein's narrative. =Victor Frankenstein's narrative= Victor begins by telling of his childhood. Born in Naples, Italy, into a wealthy Genevan family, Victor and his brothers, Ernest and William, all three being sons of Alphonse Frankenstein by the former Caroline Beaufort, are encouraged to seek a greater understanding of the world through chemistry. As a young boy, Victor is obsessed with studying theories that focus on simulating natural wonders, though later at university he is informed that such theories are considerably outdated. When Victor is five years old, his parents adopt Elizabeth Lavenza, the orphaned daughter of an expropriated Italian nobleman, with whom Victor later falls in love. During this period, Victor's parents, Alphonse and Caroline, take in yet another orphan, Justine Moritz, who becomes William's nanny. Weeks before he leaves for the University of Ingolstadt in Germany, his mother dies of scarlet fever; Victor buries himself in his experiments to deal with the grief. At the university, he excels at chemistry and other sciences, soon developing a secret technique to impart life to non-living matter. Eventually, he undertakes the creation of a humanoid, but due to the difficulty in replicating the minute parts of the human body, Victor makes the Creature tall, about in height and proportionally large. Despite Victor's selecting its features as beautiful, upon animation the creature is instead hideous, with watery white eyes and yellow skin that barely conceals the muscles and blood vessels underneath. Repulsed by his work, Victor flees when it awakens. While wandering the streets, he meets his childhood friend, Henry Clerval, and takes Henry back to his apartment, fearful of Henry's reaction if he sees the monster. However, the Creature has escaped. Victor falls ill from the experience and is nursed back to health by Henry. After a four-month recovery, he receives a letter from his father notifying him of the murder of his brother William. Upon arriving in Geneva, Victor sees the Creature near the crime scene and climbing a mountain, leading him to believe his creation is responsible. Justine Moritz, William's nanny, is convicted of the crime after William's locket, which had contained a miniature portrait of Caroline, is found in her pocket. Victor fears the consequences to himself of clearing Justine's name, and she is hanged. Ravaged by grief and guilt, Victor retreats into the mountains. The Creature finds him and pleads for Victor to hear his tale. = The Creature's narrative = Intelligent and articulate, the Creature relates his first days of life, living alone in the wilderness and finding that people were afraid of and hated him due to his appearance, which led him to fear and hide from them. While living in an abandoned structure connected to a cottage, he grew fond of the poor family living there, and discreetly collected firewood for them. Secretly living among the family for months, the Creature learned to speak by listening to them and he taught himself to read after discovering a lost satchel of books in the woods. When he saw his reflection in a pool, he realized his physical appearance was hideous, and it terrified him as it terrifies normal humans. Nevertheless, he approached the family in hopes of becoming their friend. Initially he was able to befriend the blind father figure of the family, but the rest of them were frightened and they all fled their home, resulting in the Creature leaving, disappointed. He travelled to Victor's family estate using details from Victor's journal, murdered William, and framed Justine. The Creature demands that Victor create a female companion like himself. He argues that as a living being, he has a right to happiness. The Creature promises that he and his mate will vanish into the South American wilderness, never to reappear, if Victor grants his request. Should Victor refuse his request, the Creature also threatens to kill Victor's remaining friends and loved ones and not stop until he completely ruins him. Fearing for his family, Victor reluctantly agrees. The Creature says he will watch over Victor's progress. = Victor Frankenstein's narrative resumes = Clerval accompanies him to England, but they separate at Victor's insistence at Perth, Scotland. Victor suspects that the Creature is following him. Working on the female creature on the Orkney Islands, he is plagued by premonitions of disaster, such as the female hating the Creature or becoming more evil than him, but more particularly the two creatures might lead to the breeding of a race that could plague mankind. He tears apart the unfinished female creature after he sees the Creature, who had indeed followed Victor, watching through a window. The Creature later confronts and tries to threaten Victor into working again, but Victor is convinced that the Creature is evil and that its mate would be evil as well, and the pair would threaten all humanity. Victor destroys his work and the Creature threatens him by saying \\"I will be with you on your wedding night.\\" Victor interprets this as a threat upon his life, believing that the Creature will kill him after he finally becomes happy. Victor sails out to sea to dispose of his instruments, falls asleep in the boat, is unable to return to shore because of changes in the winds, and ends up being blown to the Irish coast. When Victor lands in Ireland, he is soon imprisoned for Clerval's murder, as the Creature had strangled Clerval to death and left the corpse to be found where his creator had arrived, causing the latter to suffer another mental breakdown in prison. After being released, Victor returns home with his father, who has restored to Elizabeth some of her father's fortune. In Geneva, Victor is about to marry Elizabeth and prepares to fight the Creature to the death, arming himself with pistols and a dagger. The night following their wedding, Victor asks Elizabeth to stay in her room while he looks for \\"the fiend\\". While Victor searches the house and grounds, the Creature strangles Elizabeth to death. From the window, Victor sees the Creature, who tauntingly points at Elizabeth's corpse; Victor tries to shoot him, but the Creature escapes. After Victor gets back to Geneva, Victor's father, weakened by age and by the death of his precious Elizabeth, dies a few days later. Seeking revenge, Victor pursues the Creature to the North Pole, but collapses from exhaustion and hypothermia before he can find his quarry. =Captain Walton's conclusion= At the end of Victor's narrative, Captain Walton resumes the telling of the story, closing the frame around Victor's recounting. A few days after the Creature vanished, the ship becomes trapped in pack ice, and several crewmen die in the cold before the rest of Walton's crew insists on returning south once it is freed. Upon hearing and becoming angered by the crew's pleas to their captain, Victor lectures them with a powerful speech: it is hardship, not comfort and easiness, that defines a glorious undertaking such as theirs; he urges them to be men, not cowards. The ship is freed and Walton, owing it to the will of his unchanged men, albeit regretfully, decides to return South. Victor, even though in a very weak condition, states that he will go on by himself. He is adamant that the creature dies. Victor dies shortly thereafter, telling Walton, with his last words, to seek \\"happiness in tranquillity and avoid ambition\\". Walton discovers the Creature on his ship, mourning over Victor's body. The Creature tells Walton that Victor's death has not brought him peace; rather, his crimes have left him completely alone. The Creature vows to kill himself so that no others will ever know of his existence. Walton watches as the Creature drifts away on an ice raft that is soon \\"lost in darkness and distance\\", never to be seen again.

Shelley's mother, Mary Wollstonecraft, died from infection shortly after giving birth to her. Shelley grew a close attachment to her father having never known her mother. Her father, William Godwin, hired a nurse briefly to care for her and her half sister before he ended up remarrying. Shelley's stepmother did not like the close bond she had with her father, which caused friction and Godwin to then favour his other two daughters and sons. Her father was a famous author of the time and her education was of great importance, though not formal. Shelley grew up surrounded by her father's friends, writers and persons of political importance, who gathered often at the family home. This inspired her authorship at an early age. Shelley met Percy Bysshe Shelley, who later became her husband, at the age of sixteen while he was visiting her father. Godwin did not agree with the relationship of his daughter to an older, married but separated man, so they fled to France along with her stepsister, Claire Clairmont. Later, Shelley gave birth and lost their first child on 22 February 1815, when she gave birth two months prematurely; the baby died two weeks later. Percy, uncaring about the situation, left with Mary's stepsister Claire for an affair.\\"Journal 6 December‚ÄîVery Unwell. Shelley & Clary walk out, as usual, to heaps of places ... A letter from Hookham to say that Harriet has been brought to bed of a son and heir. Shelley writes a number of circular letters on this event, which ought to be ushered in with ringing of bells, etc., for it is the son of his wife.\\" Quoted in Spark, 39. Over eight years she endured a similar pattern of pregnancy and loss, one haemorrhaging occurring until Percy placed her upon ice to cease the bleeding. Mary and Percy's trip with Claire to visit Claire's lover Lord Byron, in Geneva during the summer of 1816, began the friendship amongst the two couples in which Byron suggested they have a competition of writing the best ghost story. Historians suggest an affair occurred too, even that paternity of one Shelley child may have been a Byron. Mary was eighteen years old when she won the contest with her creation of Frankenstein. = Literary influences = Shelley was heavily influenced by both of her parents' works. Her father was famous for Enquiry Concerning Political Justice and her mother famous for A Vindication of the Rights of Woman. Her father's novels also influenced her writing of Frankenstein. These novels included Things as They Are; or, The Adventures of Caleb Williams, St. Leon, and Fleetwood. All of these books were set in Switzerland, similar to the setting in Frankenstein. Some major themes of social affections and the renewal of life that appear in Shelley's novel stem from these works she had in her possession. Other literary influences that appear in Frankenstein are Pygmalion et Galat√©e by Mme de Genlis and Ovid with the use of an individual lacking intelligence and those individuals identifying the problems with society. Ovid also inspires the use of Prometheus in Shelley's title. Percy and Byron's discussion on life and death surrounded many scientific geniuses of the time. They discussed ideas from Erasmus Darwin and the experiments from Luigi Galvani. Mary joined these conversations and the ideas of Darwin and Galvani were both present in her novel. The horrors of not being able to write a story for the contest and her hard life also influenced the themes within Frankenstein. The themes of loss, guilt, and the consequences of defying nature present in the novel all developed from Mary Shelley's own life. The loss of her mother, the relationship with her father, and the death of her first child created the monster and his separation from parental guidance. In a 1965 issue of The Journal of Religion and Health a psychologist proposed that the theme of guilt stemmed from her not feeling good enough for Percy because of the loss of their child. Composition Draft of Frankenstein (\\"It was on a dreary night of November that I beheld my man completed ...\\") During the rainy summer of 1816, the \\"Year Without a Summer\\", the world was locked in a long cold volcanic winter caused by the eruption of Mount Tambora in 1815.Sunstein, 118. Mary Shelley, aged 18, and her lover (and later husband) Percy Bysshe Shelley visited Lord Byron at the Villa Diodati by Lake Geneva in Switzerland. The weather was consistently too cold and dreary that summer to enjoy the outdoor holiday activities they had planned, so the group retired indoors until dawn. Sitting around a log fire at Byron's villa, the company amused themselves by reading German ghost stories translated into French from the book Fantasmagoriana,Dr. John Polidori, \\"The Vampyre\\" 1819, The New Monthly Magazine and Universal Register; London: H. Colburn, 1814‚Äì1820. Vol. 1, No. 63. then Byron proposed that they \\"each write a ghost story\\".paragraph 7, Introduction, Frankenstein 1831 edition Unable to think of a story, young Mary became anxious: \\"Have you thought of a story? I was asked each morning, and each morning I was forced to reply with a mortifying negative.\\"paragraph 8, Introduction, Frankenstein 1831 edition During one evening in the middle of summer, the discussions turned to the nature of the principle of life. \\"Perhaps a corpse would be re-animated\\", Mary noted, \\"galvanism had given token of such things\\".paragraph 10, Introduction, Frankenstein 1831 edition It was after midnight before they retired, and unable to sleep, she became possessed by her imagination as she beheld the \\"grim terrors\\" of her \\"waking dream\\".Shelley, Mary. Paragraphs 11‚Äì13, \\"Introduction\\" Frankenstein (1831 edition) Gutenberg In September 2011, astronomer Donald Olson, after a visit to the Lake Geneva villa the previous year and inspecting data about the motion of the moon and stars, concluded that her \\"waking dream\\" took place \\"between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m.\\" on 16 June 1816, several days after the initial idea by Lord Byron that they each write a ghost story.Radford, Tim, Frankenstein's hour of creation identified by astronomers , The Guardian, Sunday 25 September 2011 (retrieved 5 January 2014) She began writing what she assumed would be a short story. With Percy Shelley's encouragement, she expanded the tale into a full-fledged novel.Bennett, An Introduction, 30‚Äì31; Sunstein, 124. She later described that summer in Switzerland as the moment \\"when I first stepped out from childhood into life\\".Sunstein, 117. Shelley wrote the first four chapters in the weeks following the suicide of her half- sister Fanny.Hay, 103. This was one of many personal tragedies that impacted Shelley's work. Shelley's first child died in infancy, and when she began composing Frankenstein in 1816, she was likely nursing her second child, who was also dead by the time of Frankenstein's publication. Byron managed to write just a fragment based on the vampire legends he heard while travelling the Balkans, and from this John Polidori created The Vampyre (1819), the progenitor of the romantic vampire literary genre. Thus two seminal horror tales originated from the conclave. The group talked about Enlightenment and Counter-Enlightenment ideas as well. Shelley believed the Enlightenment idea that society could progress and grow if political leaders used their powers responsibly; however, she also believed the Romantic ideal that misused power could destroy society.Bennett, Betty T. Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley: An Introduction,p.36-42. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1998. Shelley wrote much of the book while residing in a lodging house in the centre of Bath in 1816. Shelley's manuscripts for the first three-volume edition in 1818 (written 1816‚Äì1817), as well as the fair copy for her publisher, are now housed in the Bodleian Library in Oxford. The Bodleian acquired the papers in 2004, and they belong now to the Abinger Collection. In 2008, the Bodleian published a new edition of Frankenstein, edited by Charles E. Robinson, that contains comparisons of Mary Shelley's original text with Percy Shelley's additions and interventions alongside. Publication Mary Shelley by Richard Rothwell (1840‚Äì41) Shelley completed her writing in April/May 1817, and Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus was published on 1 January 1818 by the small London publishing house Lackington, Hughes, Harding, Mavor, & Jones.Bennett, Betty T. Mary Wollstonecraft. Shelley: An Introduction. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1998D. L. Macdonald and Kathleen Scherf, \\"A Note on the Text\\", Frankenstein, 2nd ed., Peterborough: Broadview Press, 1999. It was issued anonymously, with a preface written for Mary by Percy Bysshe Shelley and with a dedication to philosopher William Godwin, her father. It was published in an edition of just 500 copies in three volumes, the standard \\"triple-decker\\" format for 19th-century first editions. A variety of different editions The second (English) edition of Frankenstein was published on 11 August 1823 in two volumes (by G. and W. B. Whittaker) following the success of the stage play Presumption; or, the Fate of Frankenstein by Richard Brinsley Peake. This edition credited Mary Shelley as the book's author on its title page. On 31 October 1831, the first \\"popular\\" edition in one volume appeared, published by Henry Colburn & Richard Bentley.See forward to Barnes and Noble classic edition. This edition was heavily revised by Mary Shelley, partially to make the story less radical. It included a lengthy new preface by the author, presenting a somewhat embellished version of the genesis of the story. This edition is the one most widely published and read now, although a few editions follow the 1818 text.The edition published by Forgotten Books is the original text, as is the \\"Ignatius Critical Edition\\". Vintage Books has an edition presenting both versions. Some scholars prefer the original version, arguing that it preserves the spirit of Mary Shelley's vision (see Anne K. Mellor's \\"Choosing a Text of Frankenstein to Teach\\" in the W. W. Norton Critical edition). Frankenstein and the Monster=The Creature= Fenian movement as akin to Frankenstein's creature, in the wake of the Phoenix Park murders in an 1882 issue of Punch.Frankenstein:Celluloid Monster at the National Library of Medicine website of the (U.S.) National Institutes of Health Part of Frankenstein's rejection of his creation is the fact that he does not give it a name, which causes a lack of identity. Instead it is referred to by words such as \\"wretch\\", \\"monster\\", \\"creature\\", \\"demon\\", \\"devil\\", \\"fiend\\", and \\"it\\". When Frankenstein converses with the creature in Chapter 10, he addresses it as \\"vile insect\\", \\"abhorred monster\\", \\"fiend\\", \\"wretched devil\\", and \\"abhorred devil\\". During a telling of Frankenstein, Shelley referred to the creature as \\"Adam\\". from the travelling exhibition Frankenstein: Penetrating the Secrets of Nature Shelley was referring to the first man in the Garden of Eden, as in her epigraph: :Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay :To mould Me man? Did I solicit thee :From darkness to promote me? ::John Milton, Paradise Lost (X. 743‚Äì45) Although the creature was described in later works as a composite of whole body parts grafted together from cadavers and reanimated by the use of electricity, this description is not consistent with Shelley's work; both the use of electricity and the cobbled-together image of Frankenstein's monster were more the result of James Whale's popular 1931 film adaptation of the story, and other early motion-picture works based upon the creature. In Shelley's original work, Victor Frankenstein discovers a previously unknown but elemental principle of life, and that insight allows him to develop a method to imbue vitality into inanimate matter, though the exact nature of the process is left largely ambiguous. After a great deal of hesitation in exercising this power, Frankenstein spends two years painstakingly constructing the creature's proportionally large body (one anatomical feature at a time, from raw materials supplied by \\"the dissecting room and the slaughter-house\\"), which he then brings to life using his unspecified process. The creature has often been mistakenly called \\"Frankenstein\\". In 1908 one author said \\"It is strange to note how well-nigh universally the term \\"Frankenstein\\" is misused, even by intelligent people, as describing some hideous monster\\". Author's Digest: The World's Great Stories in Brief, by Rossiter Johnson, 1908 Edith Wharton's The Reef (1916) describes an unruly child as an \\"infant Frankenstein.\\"The Reef, p. 96. David Lindsay's \\"The Bridal Ornament\\", published in The Rover, 12 June 1844, mentioned \\"the maker of poor Frankenstein\\". After the release of Whale's cinematic Frankenstein, the public at large began speaking of the creature itself as \\"Frankenstein\\". This also occurs in Frankenstein films, including Bride of Frankenstein (1935) and several subsequent films, as well as in film titles such as Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein. Furthermore, the 1939 film Son of Frankenstein introduced an evil laboratory assistant, Ygor (Bela Lugosi), who never existed in the original narrative. =Origin of Victor Frankenstein's name= Mary Shelley maintained that she derived the name Frankenstein from a dream-vision. This claim has since been disputed and debated by scholars that have suggested alternative sources for Shelley's inspiration. The German name Frankenstein means \\"stone of the Franks\\", and is associated with various places in Germany, including Frankenstein Castle (Burg Frankenstein) in Darmstadt, Hesse, and Frankenstein Castle in Frankenstein, a town in the Palatinate. There is also a castle called Frankenstein in Bad Salzungen, Thuringia, and a municipality called Frankenstein in Saxony. Until 1945, ZƒÖbkowice ≈ölƒÖskie, now a city in Lower Silesian Voivodeship, Poland, was mainly populated by Germans and was the site of a scandal involving gravediggers in 1606, which has been suggested as an inspiration to the author. Finally, the name is borne by the aristocratic House of Franckenstein from Franconia. Radu Florescu argued that Mary and Percy Shelley visited Frankenstein Castle near Darmstadt in 1814, where alchemist Johann Conrad Dippel had experimented with human bodies, and reasoned that Mary suppressed mention of her visit in order to maintain her public claim of originality.. A literary essay by A. J. Day supports Florescu's position that Mary Shelley knew of, and visited Frankenstein Castle before writing her debut novel. Day includes details of an alleged description of the Frankenstein castle in Mary Shelley's 'lost' journals, however, according to J√∂rg Hel√©ne, the 'lost journals', as well as Florescu's claims, cannot be verified. A possible interpretation of the name Victor is derived from Paradise Lost by John Milton, a great influence on Shelley (a quotation from Paradise Lost is on the opening page of Frankenstein, and Shelley writes that the monster reads it in the novel).. Milton frequently refers to God as \\"the victor\\" in Paradise Lost, and Shelley refers to Victor as playing God by creating life. In addition, Shelley's portrayal of the monster owes much to the character of Satan in Paradise Lost; and, the monster says in the story, after reading the epic poem, that he empathizes with Satan's role. Parallels between Victor Frankenstein and Mary's husband Percy Shelley have also been drawn.There are many similarities from his usage of Victor as a pen name in the collection of poetry he wrote with his sister Elizabeth, Original Poetry by Victor and Cazire, to Percy's days at Eton where he had \\"experimented with electricity and magnetism as well as with gunpowder and numerous chemical reactions\\", and whose rooms at Oxford were filled with scientific equipment. Percy Shelley was also the first-born son of a wealthy country squire with strong political connections and a descendant of Sir Bysshe Shelley, 1st Baronet of Castle Goring, and Richard Fitzalan, 10th Earl of Arundel.Percy Shelley#Ancestry While Victor's family is one of the most distinguished of that republic and his ancestors were counsellors and syndics. Percy had a sister named Elizabeth; Victor had an adopted sister named Elizabeth. =Modern Prometheus= The Modern Prometheus is the novel's subtitle (though modern editions now drop it, only mentioning it in introduction).For example, the Longman study edition published in India in 2007 by Pearson Education Prometheus, in versions of Greek mythology, was the Titan who created mankind in the image of the gods that could have a spirit breathed into it at the behest of Zeus.In the best-known versions of the Prometheus story, by Hesiod and Aeschylus, Prometheus merely brings fire to mankind. But in other versions, such as several of Aesop's fables (See in particular Fable 516), Sappho (Fragment 207), and Ovid's Metamorphoses, Prometheus is the actual creator of humanity. Prometheus then taught man to hunt, but after he tricked Zeus into accepting \\"poor-quality offerings\\" from humans, Zeus kept fire from mankind. Prometheus took back the fire from Zeus to give to man. When Zeus discovered this, he sentenced Prometheus to be eternally punished by fixing him to a rock of Caucasus, where each day an eagle pecked out his liver, only for the liver to regrow the next day because of his immortality as a god. As a Pythagorean, or believer in An Essay on Abstinence from Animal Food, as a Moral Duty by Joseph Ritson, Mary Shelley saw Prometheus not as a hero but rather as something of a devil, and blamed him for bringing fire to man and thereby seducing the human race to the vice of eating meat.(Leonard Wolf, p. 20). Percy wrote several essays on what became known as vegetarianism including A Vindication of Natural Diet. In 1910, Edison Studios released the first motion-picture adaptation of Shelley's story. The Titan in the Greek mythology of Prometheus parallels Victor Frankenstein. Victor's work by creating man by new means reflects the same innovative work of the Titan in creating humans. Byron was particularly attached to the play Prometheus Bound by Aeschylus, and Percy Shelley soon wrote his own Prometheus Unbound (1820). The term \\"Modern Prometheus\\" was derived from Immanuel Kant who described Benjamin Franklin as the \\"Prometheus of modern times\\" in reference to his experiments with electricity.RoyalSoc.ac.uk \\"Benjamin Franklin in London.\\" The Royal Society. Retrieved 8 August 2007. In the novel, the monster is identified by words such as \\"creature\\", \\"monster\\", \\"daemon\\", \\"wretch\\", \\"abortion\\", \\"fiend\\" and \\"it\\", and is also called an \\"Image\\". Frankenstein and the monster separately compare themselves with the \\"fallen\\" angel, although without naming him. Speaking to Frankenstein, the monster says \\"I ought to be thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel\\". That angel would be Lucifer (meaning \\"light-bringer\\") in Milton's Paradise Lost, which the monster has read; this relates to the disobedience of Prometheus in the book's subtitle. Shelley's inspirations Shelley incorporated a number of different themes, the influence of John Milton's Paradise Lost, and Samuel Taylor Coleridge's The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, are clearly evident within the novel. In The Frankenstein of the French Revolution author Julia Douthwaite posits Shelley likely acquired some ideas for Frankenstein's character from Humphry Davy's book Elements of Chemical Philosophy, in which he had written that \\"science has ... bestowed upon man powers which may be called creative; which have enabled him to change and modify the beings around him ...\\". References to the French Revolution run through the novel; a possible source may lie in 's Le Miroir des √©v√©nemens actuels, ou la Belle au plus offrant (1790): a political parable about scientific progress featuring an inventor named Frank√©ste√Øn who creates a life-sized automaton.Douthwaite, \\"The Frankenstein of the French Revolution\\" chapter 2 of The Frankenstein of 1790 and other Lost Chapters from Revolutionary France (Frankenstein of 1790 and other Lost Chapters from Revolutionary France , 2012). Percy Shelley's 1816 poem \\"Mutability\\" is quoted, its theme of the role of the subconscious is discussed in prose and the monster quotes a passage from the poem. Percy Shelley's name never appeared as the author of the poem, although the novel credits other quoted poets by name. Samuel Taylor Coleridge's poem \\"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\" (1798) is associated with the theme of guilt and William Wordsworth's \\"Tintern Abbey\\" (1798) with that of innocence. Many writers and historians have attempted to associate several then popular natural philosophers (now called physical scientists) with Shelley's work on account of several notable similarities. Two of the most noted natural philosophers among Shelley's contemporaries were Giovanni Aldini, who made many public attempts at human reanimation through bio-electric Galvanism in London and Johann Konrad Dippel, who was supposed to have developed chemical means to extend the life span of humans. While Shelley was aware of both these men and their activities, she makes no mention of or reference to them or their experiments in any of her published or released notes.  Reception  Illustration by Theodor von Holst from the frontispiece of the 1831 editionThis illustration is reprinted in the frontispiece to the 2008 edition of Frankenstein Frankenstein has been both well received and disregarded since its anonymous publication in 1818. Critical reviews of that time demonstrate these two views, along with confused speculation as to the identity of the author. Walter Scott, writing in Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine, congratulated \\"the author's original genius and happy power of expression\\", although he is less convinced about the way in which the monster gains knowledge about the world and language. La Belle Assembl√©e described the novel as \\"very bold fiction\\" and the Edinburgh Magazine and Literary Miscellany hoped to see \\"more productions ... from this author\\". On the other hand, John Wilson Croker, writing anonymously in the Quarterly Review, although conceding that \\"the author has powers, both of conception and language\\", described the book as \\"a tissue of horrible and disgusting absurdity\\". In two other reviews where the author is known as the daughter of William Godwin, the criticism of the novel makes reference to the feminine nature of Mary Shelley. The British Critic attacks the novel's flaws as the fault of the author: \\"The writer of it is, we understand, a female; this is an aggravation of that which is the prevailing fault of the novel; but if our authoress can forget the gentleness of her sex, it is no reason why we should; and we shall therefore dismiss the novel without further comment\\". The Literary Panorama and National Register attacks the novel as a \\"feeble imitation of Mr. Godwin's novels\\" produced by the \\"daughter of a celebrated living novelist\\". Despite the reviews, Frankenstein achieved an almost immediate popular success. It became widely known especially through melodramatic theatrical adaptations‚ÄîMary Shelley saw a production of Presumption; or The Fate of Frankenstein, a play by Richard Brinsley Peake, in 1823. A French translation appeared as early as 1821 (Frankenstein: ou le Prom√©th√©e Moderne, translated by Jules Saladin). Critical reception of Frankenstein has been largely positive since the mid-20th century. Major critics such as M. A. Goldberg and Harold Bloom have praised the \\"aesthetic and moral\\" relevance of the novel, although there are also critics such as Germaine Greer, who criticized the novel as terrible due to technical and narrative defects (such as it featuring three narrators who speak in the same way). In more recent years the novel has become a popular subject for psychoanalytic and feminist criticism: Lawrence Lipking states: \\"[E]ven the Lacanian subgroup of psychoanalytic criticism, for instance, has produced at least half a dozen discrete readings of the novel\\".L. Lipking. Frankenstein the True Story; or Rousseau Judges Jean-Jacques. (Published in the Norton critical edition. 1996) Frankenstein is one of the most recommended books on Five Books, with literary scholars, psychologists, novelists, and historians citing it as an influential text.

You were brought to this world by people that don't care for you and you are thrown into a world of pain and suffering, and tears and hunger. It's an amazing book written by a teenage girl. It's mind-blowing.\\" Professor of philosophy Patricia MacCormack says the creature, brought to life by Victor Frankenstein, addresses the most fundamental human questions: \\"It's the idea of asking your maker what your purpose is.

Production BBC Four controller Janice Hadlow commissioned the series from Icon Films for broadcast as part of the channel's Journeys of Discovery season. The series combines footage of explorer and travel writer Benedict Allen following in the footsteps of his subjects with interviews and archive footage to provide an insight into their lives. Allen has written that the series was made to answer a question he had first asked himself when he lost his dog team in the Bering Strait pack ice and his prospects looked grim. Where does the troublesome urge of the British to wander off alone, often without even bothering to give a half-decent excuse, come from? Reception Sarah Dempster writing in The Guardian describes the, wonderful little series, as, part leisurely biography, part arduous travelogue, that, offers an unabashedly nostalgic peek into the life of the 20th-century adventurer. Tim Teeman writing in The Times described episode one as, hopelessly muddled, slow and uninsightful, opining that Allen managed to extinguish all the lyricism, and spirit of adventure and discovery, from Newby‚Äôs work, but concluding that, it was lovely to see Newby in archive footage cycle in the roiling morning commute, head high and defiantly and perilously weaving through the middle lane as beeping echoed all about him. Joe Clay writing in the same publication called it, a mature, inspiring hour of quintessentially British spirit. Episodes=Episode one: Eric Newby= Allen begins his film chatting with the attendees of Eric Newby's memorial service in Covent Garden. Newby's wife Wanda discusses the curiously British drive for exploration and Newby's split-personality of urbane and adventurous. Allen visits Newby's childhood home in Hammersmith where at St. Paul's School he reads of Newby's poor academic ability. Newby was unable to complete his studies and his friends Pat Allen, Katherine Whitehorn and Adrian House of the Travellers' Club ponder whether this drove him to prove himself by enlisting on the tea clipper Moshulu. Wanda relates how Newby's captioning of his photographs for publication resulted in The Last Grain Race. On the eve of World War II Newby enlisted in the Black Watch and after Sandhurst he was captured on an SBS mission in Italy. Fellow POW Pat Spooner recalls Newby's positive attitude at this time when he first met his future wife. Wanda recalls after the war the couple joined the family costumier firm Lane and Newby where he indulged his passion for fashion but was ultimately unfulfilled. Allen meets Newby's old travelling companion Hugh Carless at Snowdonia where the two novice climbers spent weekend practising for an impromptu trip to Afghanistan. Wanda gives Allen Newby's bag as he sets off, with cameraman Peter Jouvenal, to follow in his footsteps. Allen finds life in remote Nuristan little changed since Newby's time and the Panchea Valley and its inhabitants match his descriptions. Allen locates Newby's original guide who reminisces about Newby and Carliss and the impression that they made. Newby and Carliss never made it to the summit of Mir Samir but the author's self-deprecating style is best exemplified for Allen in his book of the trip A Short Walk in the Hindu Kush. Allen is also forced to turn back but pauses at the point where a historic meeting between Newby and the professional explorer Wilfred Thesiger symbolised the beginning of the age of the traveller. =Episode two: Laurie Lee= Explorer, writer and broadcaster Benedict Allen retraces part of author Laurie Lee's journey across Spain in 1935, which became the basis for his celebrated travelogue As I Walked Out One Midsummer Morning. Lee thought of himself first and foremost as a poet, and the book reveals a poet's sensibility in its meticulous, distilled observations of the country and people he quickly came to love. Allen tries to find out whether Lee's evocative prose actually works as travel writing and Lee is revealed as an enigmatic, mercurial figure in the tradition of the wandering minstrel or troubadour, with a huge array of talents and an astonishing facility to charm. =Episode three: Patrick Leigh Fermor= Benedict Allen follows Patrick Leigh Fermor's epic 1934 quest across Europe, tracing the inns, haystacks and castles the young adventurer stayed in as he foot-slogged his way through the Netherlands, Germany, Hungary and Romania towards Byzantium. With his academic career punctuated by numerous school expulsions, the young Patrick Leigh Fermor put aside his troubles and set out across Europe to reach Constantinople in Turkey. It was the original backpacker journey, but also a quest in the romantic tradition of Lord Byron - that of the man of action and the intellectual combined. His two accounts of that journey, A Time of Gifts and Between the Woods and the Water, are a masterly portrait of a Europe about to be swept aside by war, and also an insight into the brilliant, classically educated mind of the author. It is in remotest Greece that Benedict Allen finally tracks down the great man himself to discuss the nature, purpose and future of travel writing.

This is one of the two Rolls-Royce models purchased by former President Get√∫lio Vargas in 1953. =Origins= When Get√∫lio Vargas became president in 1951, he had two Cadillacs as official state cars, dating from 1941 and 1947 respectively. Rolls-Royce was chosen to prepare four Silver Wraith models with special modifications for security, with the intention to purchase two examples. Vargas received the first hardtop model on 31 January 1953. The first foreign head of state to use it was General Manuel Odria, President of Peru. The government paid ¬£5,831 for the hardtop model and ¬£7,540 for the second Silver Wraith, a cabriolet. The cars were paid for by wealthy friends as a present to Vargas himself, on condition that he would donate them to the presidency at the end of his term in office. With political problems, Vargas shot himself in the chest on 24 August 1954 and, with his suicide, the handover did not happen. The cars became part of the President's estate and were claimed by his family. The solution only came in 1957, although the cars had still been used by President Juscelino Kubitschek de Oliveira in the interim. The family took the hardtop Rolls-Royce and gave the cabriolet to the presidency. The last official service of the hardtop model was for the personal transportation of Berta Craveiro Lopes, wife of Portuguese president General Craveiro Lopes. =Queen Elizabeth II= It had been claimed that the convertible model was a gift from Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, but this is not the case, although she did use the car during a 1968 state visit to Brazil. =Nowadays= The car can be seen in state ceremonies that take place on the first Sunday of each month at the Planalto Palace and in the streets around it. Sometimes, the car is also used for the rehearsal of state ceremonies and parades. Its speed limit is 80 km/h, but it is rarely seen to travel faster than 20 km/h. The daily transportation of the President is made by modern vehicles, with the Rolls-Royce reserved exclusively for ceremonial occasions. In 2001, the Rolls-Royce was sent for restoration by President Fernando Henrique Cardoso after 48 years of service.

Lab√≤ was born at Borgonovo Val Tidone, near Piacenza. While in the army, he came to the notice of the conductor Antonino Votto, and subsequently studied with Ettore Campogalliani in Parma, Renato Pastorino in Milan and Valentino Metti in Piacenza. He made his stage debut at the Teatro Municipale in Piacenza, as Cavaradossi in Tosca, in 1954. He quickly sang widely in Italy and various European opera houses, as well as in South America, before making his debut on November 29, 1957, at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, as Alvaro in La forza del destino, where he sang thirteen roles in eight seasons, including Alfredo in La traviata, Manrico in Il trovatore, and Radam√®s in A√Øda. In 1959, he sang at the New York City Opera as Calaf in Puccini's Turandot (conducted by Julius Rudel) and Rodolfo in La boh√®me (opposite Chester Ludgin as Marcello). He also appeared at the San Francisco Opera, and the opera houses of Philadelphia, Houston, and New Orleans. Other important debuts were at the Royal Opera House in London, and the Palais Garnier in Paris, both as Radam√®s in A√Øda in 1959. He first sang at La Scala in Milan, in the title role of Don Carlos, in 1960. He appeared at the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino in 1967, as Gualtiero in Il pirata, opposite Montserrat Caball√©, and was a regular guest at the Verona Arena. He also made guest appearances at the Vienna State Opera, the Zurich Opera, the Teatro Nacional Sao Carlos in Lisbon, and the Teatro Col√≥n in Buenos Aires. Lab√≤ was admired for his robust, typically Italianate voice, and his direct unaffected manner, other notable roles included Macduff in Verdi's Macbeth, Enzo in La Gioconda, and Turiddu in Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana. His last performance was in Turin, as Ismaele in Nabucco, in 1987. He died in an automobile accident caused by fog in Milan at the age of 64. He made relatively few recordings, but can be heard in a complete Don Carlos, opposite Antonietta Stella, Ettore Bastianini, Boris Christoff, for Deutsche Grammophon, in 1960. He also recorded excerpts of Manon Lescaut, opposite Anna Moffo, for RCA, in 1963.

It starred Robin Stevens as Mr. Perfect and Patricia Routledge as the narrator. The 26 episodes were written by Alan Dapre & Robin Stevens and on 1 season. Since 2006, the show has been difficult to find, due to it not getting a home media release of any kind, and has been regarded as lost. The show features the 3D animated 'Blips' (a group of purple blobs that wreak havoc in each episode) characters alongside the main protagonist Mr Perfect. Plot In every episode, Mr. Perfect would aim to show the viewers how to perform a job or task perfectly. These are ranged from serving ice cream or using exercising equipment. Once it did it all once, the blips would rewind the footage before the narrator would say he was perfect at the job and start all over again. This time, the blips would ruin Mr. Perfect's work progress by setting traps or tampering with machines to make them go wrong. After this, Perfect would give up on doing the job or task, and the show would cut to the credits, with Perfect relaxing with a cup of tea and walking home. = Characters = Mr. Perfect  Portrayed by Stevens, he is depicted as an everyman with an overly optimistic, goofy manner. He seems to be mute, using body language to communicate. His attire varies across each episode to fit the situation, but his main outfit consists of thick-framed glasses, tidy hair and a bright blue suit. Not much else is known about him.  The Blips  Purple-coloured alien-like beings that can take on various sizes and shapes. Like Perfect, not much is known about them. A recurring comedic theme in the show is Perfect becoming suspicious of their existence due to the mishaps they cause, but never actually encountering them.  Episodes = Series overview = Broadcast  The first episode was broadcast on CITV sometime in 2005, with reruns occurring spontaneously even after the final episode was produced. = Missing episodes = Like numerous other shows on CITV, the majority of, if not all of the episodes and their whereabouts are unknown, with frames from the episodes and an interactive webpage provided by Ragdoll being the only things intact. The overall lack of popularity of the show amongst its target audience compared to some of Ragdoll's other franchises and no home media release have likely contributed to this.

The newspaper was founded in March 1986 by Robert C. Bergenheim, who at the time was also publisher of the Boston Business Journal, and published its first issue that May. His son, Roger C. Bergenheim, has been the paper‚Äôs publisher for much of its history. At the time it began, Providence Business News was one of three business publications in Rhode Island, the other two being Business Fortnightly of Rhode Island and Ocean State Business, both biweekly magazines. Business Fortnightly ceased publication in June 1986, and Ocean State Business closed up shop in 1990. In 1987, Bergenheim sold his company, P&L; Publications Inc., to MCP Inc. of Minneapolis, but retained part ownership in Providence Business News. Roger Bergenheim succeeded him as publisher of the Boston paper in 1988 and for a time David C. Dunbar, an advertising executive at Providence Business News, took over as that newspaper‚Äôs publisher, before Bergenheim returned to the post. The paper was redesigned in 2004 by Creative Circle Media Consulting of Providence, which later redesigned and now hosts the paper‚Äôs website.

Formed in 1980, the band currently comprises lead vocalist Mike Muir, guitarist Dean Pleasants, bassist Ra D√≠az and drummer Dave Lombardo. Band member biography Suicidal Tendencies formed in Santa Monica, Los Angeles, California in 1980 by Mike Muir, guitarist Mike Ball, bassist Mike Dunnigan and drummer Carlos Egert. A short-lived lineup, Ball and Egert left after a matter of months, prompting Mike Dunnigan (‚Ä†) to switch to guitar and having his brother, Sean, join on drums, and Andrew Evans joined on bass. Mike Dunnigan would later be replaced by Rick Battson. By 1983, Battson, Evans and Sean Dunnigan (‚Ä†) had left the band, to be replaced by Grant Estes, Louiche Mayorga and Amery Smith on guitar, bass and drums respectively. After the 1983 release of the band's self-titled debut album Estes left the band and was replaced by Jon Nelson. In 1984, Nelson and Smith left Suicidal Tendencies and was briefly replaced by Anthony Gallo who left to form Los Cycos with Muir. Enter Rocky George and R. J. Herrera.http://www.ultimate- guitar.com/news/interviews/rocky_george_talks_about_his_time_in_suicidal_tendencies.html After Join the Army was released in 1987,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGaBVb8Hpg4 Mayorga left the band that same year, being replaced by Ric Clayton (formerly of No Mercy) before hiring Bob Heathcote. Also in 1987, they hired Mike Clark (who was also a member of No Mercy) as their second guitarist, then making Suicidal Tendencies a five- piece band. The lineup of Muir, George, Clark, Heathcote and Herrera recorded one album together in 1988, before Heathcote left the band a year later. Heathcote was replaced by Robert Trujillo. After the release of their next two albums, Controlled by Hatred/Feel Like Shit...D√©j√† Vu (1989) and Lights...Camera...Revolution! (1990), Herrera left Suicidal Tendencies in 1991 and their next album was recorded without an official replacement for him; session musician Josh Freese handled the drum tracks. Herrera would eventually be replaced by Jimmy DeGrasso. After the 1994 release of Suicidal for Life, relationships between band members began to deteriorate and core members began to leave. This resulted in the band's split in 1995. However, Muir and Clark brought Suicidal Tendencies back together a year later and hired three new members, Dean Pleasants on guitar, Josh Paul on bass and Brooks Wackerman on drums. The reunion lineup recorded the albums Freedumb (1999) and Free Your Soul and Save My Mind (2000), before Wackerman left the band in 2001 to join Bad Religion and be replaced by Ron Bruner. Bassist Paul left in 2002 and was replaced by Ron's brother Stephen \\"Thundercat\\" Bruner. By 2005, Ron Bruner had left the band, and Dave Hidalgo had taken over on drums. In 2007, Dave Hidalgo was replaced by Infectious Grooves drummer and 2003 Guitar Center \\"Drum-off\\" champion Eric Moore.http://www.allmusic.com/artist/suicidal-tendencies-p5554 During the band's extensive touring regiment in 2011 and 2012, bassist Stephen Bruner was absent for many of the shows due to his solo career interests and other music commitments. Replacing him in his touring role for the band has been Tim \\"Rawbiz\\" Williams. Mike Clark suffered a head injury requiring 9 staples at a pre-show incident in Santa Cruz on May 31, 2012 and left the band soon after. He was replaced by Nico Santora. Another lineup change took place in March 2014 when Thomas Pridgen replaced Eric Moore on drums after the band destroyed Moore's drum kit during a video recording without first informing him of the intended action. On August 27, 2014, Suicidal Tendencies announced the death of their bassist Tim Williams on the band's Facebook page. Williams was replaced by Michael Morgan, and then two years later, Morgan was replaced by Ra D√≠az. Also in 2016, guitarist Nico Santora left the band and was replaced by Oneironaut guitarist Jeff Pogan, while drummer Eric Moore was replaced by former Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo. Pogan announced his departure from the band in July 2018. Current members Lead vocalist Mike Muir is the only remaining original member of Suicidal Tendencies. Guitarist Rocky George recorded and performed live with Suicidal Tendencies for 11 years, from 1984 to 1995. Gutiarist Dean Pleasents has been with Suicidal Tendencies since their reunion in 1996, replacing Rocky George. Robert Trujillo was the second long-term bassist of the band, having replaced Bob Heathcote in 1989. Drummer Jimmy DeGrasso officially joined Suicidal Tendencies in 1992 as R.J. Herrera's replacement and stayed with the band until their hiatus in 1995. Drummer Brooks Wackerman joined Suicidal Tendencies in 1996, when they reunited, and performed on their first two reunion albums before leaving the band in 2001 to join Bad Religion. ;Mike Muir :Active: 1980-present :Instruments: lead vocals :Release contributions: all Suicidal Tendencies releases ;Dean Pleasants :Active: 1996-present :Instruments: lead guitar, backing vocals :Release contributions: all Suicidal Tendencies releases since Six the Hard Way (1998) ;Dave Lombardo :Active: 2016-present :Instruments: drums :Release contributions: all Suicidal Tendencies releases since World Gone Mad (2016) ;Ra D√≠az :Active: 2016-present :Instruments: bass, backing vocals :Release contributions: all Suicidal Tendencies releases since World Gone Mad (2016) ;Ben Weinman :Active: 2018-present :Instruments: rhythm guitar :Release contributions: None Former members=Guitarists= *Mike Ball :Active: 1980-1982 :Release contributions: Never played on any Suicidal Tendencies release *Rick Battson :Active: 1982-1983 :Release contributions: Never played on any Suicidal Tendencies release *Grant Estes :Active: 1983 :Release contributions: Suicidal Tendencies (1983) *Jon Nelson :Active: 1983-1984 :Release contributions: Never played on any Suicidal Tendencies release (contributed to songwriting: \\"Look Up (The Boys Are Back In Town)\\", \\"War Inside My Head\\", \\"You Got, I Want‚Äù, and ‚ÄúHuman Guinea Pig‚Äù) *Anthony Gallo :Active: 1984-1985 :Release contributions: Played on \\"Welcome to Venice\\" (Suicidal Records 1985) *Rocky George :Active: 1984-1995 :Release contributions: Join the Army (1987), How Will I Laugh Tomorrow When I Can't Even Smile Today (1988), Controlled by Hatred/Feel Like Shit...D√©j√† Vu (1989), Lights...Camera...Revolution!

An Air France A380 on approach to Washington Dulles International Airport Transport (commonly used in the U.K.), or transportation (used in the U.S.), is the movement of humans, animals and goods from one location to another. In other words, the action of transport is defined as a particular movement of an organism or thing from a point A (a place in space) to a point B. Modes of transport include air, land (rail and road), water, cable, pipeline and space. The field can be divided into infrastructure, vehicles and operations. Transport enables trade between people, which is essential for the development of civilizations. Transport infrastructure consists of the fixed installations, including roads, railways, airways, waterways, canals and pipelines and terminals such as airports, railway stations, bus stations, warehouses, trucking terminals, refueling depots (including fueling docks and fuel stations) and seaports. Terminals may be used both for interchange of passengers and cargo and for maintenance. Vehicles traveling on these networks may include automobiles, bicycles, buses, trains, trucks, helicopters, watercraft, spacecraft and aircraft. Operations deal with the way the vehicles are operated, and the procedures set for this purpose, including financing, legalities, and policies. In the transport industry, operations and ownership of infrastructure can be either public or private, depending on the country and mode. Passenger transport may be public, where operators provide scheduled services, or private. Freight transport has become focused on containerization, although bulk transport is used for large volumes of durable items. Transport plays an important part in economic growth and globalization, but most types cause air pollution and use large amounts of land. While it is heavily subsidized by governments, good planning of transport is essential to make traffic flow and restrain urban sprawl. The United Nation's first formally recognized the role of transport in sustainable development in the 1992 United Nation's Earth summit. In the 2012 United Nation's World Conference, global leaders unanimously recognised that transport and mobility are central to achieving the sustainability targets. In recent years, data has been collected to show that the transport sector contributes to a quarter of the global greenhouse gas emissions and thus, sustainable transport has been mainstreamed across several of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, especially those related to food, security, health, energy, economic growth, infrastructure, and cities and human settlements. Meeting sustainable transport targets is said to be particularly important to achieving the Paris Agreement. Modes A mode of transport is a solution that makes use of a particular type of vehicle, infrastructure, and operation. The transport of a person or of cargo may involve one mode or several of the modes, with the latter case being called intermodal or multimodal transport. Each mode has its own advantages and disadvantages, and will be chosen on the basis of cost, capability, and route. =Human- powered= Human-powered transport remains common in developing countries. Human-powered transport, a form of sustainable transport, is the transport of people and/or goods using human muscle-power, in the form of walking, running and swimming. Modern technology has allowed machines to enhance human power. Human-powered transport remains popular for reasons of cost-saving, leisure, physical exercise, and environmentalism; it is sometimes the only type available, especially in underdeveloped or inaccessible regions. Although humans are able to walk without infrastructure, the transport can be enhanced through the use of roads, especially when using the human power with vehicles, such as bicycles and inline skates. Human-powered vehicles have also been developed for difficult environments, such as snow and water, by watercraft rowing and skiing; even the air can be entered with human-powered aircraft. =Animal-powered= Animal-powered transport is the use of working animals for the movement of people and commodities. Humans may ride some of the animals directly, use them as pack animals for carrying goods, or harness them, alone or in teams, to pull sleds or wheeled vehicles. =Air= An alt=White jet aircraft coming into land, undercarriage fully extended. Under each wing is a turbofan engine A fixed-wing aircraft, commonly called airplane, is a heavier-than-air craft where movement of the air in relation to the wings is used to generate lift. The term is used to distinguish this from rotary-wing aircraft, where the movement of the lift surfaces relative to the air generates lift. A gyroplane is both fixed-wing and rotary wing. Fixed-wing aircraft range from small trainers and recreational aircraft to large airliners and military cargo aircraft. Two things necessary for aircraft are air flow over the wings for lift and an area for landing. The majority of aircraft also need an airport with the infrastructure to receive maintenance, restocking, refueling and for the loading and unloading of crew, cargo, and passengers. While the vast majority of aircraft land and take off on land, some are capable of take-off and landing on ice, snow, and calm water. The aircraft is the second fastest method of transport, after the rocket. Commercial jets can reach up to , single-engine aircraft . Aviation is able to quickly transport people and limited amounts of cargo over longer distances, but incurs high costs and energy use; for short distances or in inaccessible places, helicopters can be used.Cooper et al., 1998: 281 As of April 28, 2009, The Guardian article notes that \\"the WHO estimates that up to 500,000 people are on planes at any time.\\"Swine flu prompts EU warning on travel to US. The Guardian. April 28, 2009. =Land= Land transport covers all land-based transport systems that provide for the movement of people, goods and services. Land transport plays a vital role in linking communities to each other. Land transport is a key factor in urban planning. It consists of 2 kinds, rail and road. Rail alt=White electric train with red cheatline emerging from tunnel in the countryside The Beijing Subway is one of the world's largest and busiest rapid transit networks. Rail transport is where a train runs along a set of two parallel steel rails, known as a railway or railroad. The rails are anchored perpendicular to ties (or sleepers) of timber, concrete or steel, to maintain a consistent distance apart, or gauge. The rails and perpendicular beams are placed on a foundation made of concrete or compressed earth and gravel in a bed of ballast. Alternative methods include monorail and maglev. A train consists of one or more connected vehicles that operate on the rails. Propulsion is commonly provided by a locomotive, that hauls a series of unpowered cars, that can carry passengers or freight. The locomotive can be powered by steam, diesel or by electricity supplied by trackside systems. Alternatively, some or all the cars can be powered, known as a multiple unit. Also, a train can be powered by horses, cables, gravity, pneumatics and gas turbines. Railed vehicles move with much less friction than rubber tires on paved roads, making trains more energy efficient, though not as efficient as ships. Intercity trains are long-haul services connecting cities;Cooper et al., 1998: 279 modern high-speed rail is capable of speeds up to , but this requires specially built track. Regional and commuter trains feed cities from suburbs and surrounding areas, while intra-urban transport is performed by high-capacity tramways and rapid transits, often making up the backbone of a city's public transport. Freight trains traditionally used box cars, requiring manual loading and unloading of the cargo. Since the 1960s, container trains have become the dominant solution for general freight, while large quantities of bulk are transported by dedicated trains. Road The Harbor Freeway is often heavily congested at rush hour in Downtown Los Angeles. A road is an identifiable route, way or path between two or more places. Roads are typically smoothed, paved, or otherwise prepared to allow easy travel; though they need not be, and historically many roads were simply recognizable routes without any formal construction or maintenance.Lay, 1992: 6‚Äì7 In urban areas, roads may pass through a city or village and be named as streets, serving a dual function as urban space easement and route. The most common road vehicle is the automobile; a wheeled passenger vehicle that carries its own motor. Other users of roads include buses, trucks, motorcycles, bicycles and pedestrians. As of 2010, there were 1.015 billion automobiles worldwide. Road transport offers a complete freedom to road users to transfer the vehicle from one lane to the other and from one road to another according to the need and convenience. This flexibility of changes in location, direction, speed, and timings of travel is not available to other modes of transport. It is possible to provide door to door service only by road transport. Automobiles provide high flexibility with low capacity, but require high energy and area use, and are the main source of harmful noise and air pollution in cities; buses allow for more efficient travel at the cost of reduced flexibility.Cooper et al., 1998: 278 Road transport by truck is often the initial and final stage of freight transport. =Water= Automobile ferry in alt=White ferry with ramps in the up-position, moored at jetty Water transport is movement by means of a watercraft‚Äîsuch as a barge, boat, ship or sailboat‚Äîover a body of water, such as a sea, ocean, lake, canal or river. The need for buoyancy is common to watercraft, making the hull a dominant aspect of its construction, maintenance and appearance. In the 19th century, the first steam ships were developed, using a steam engine to drive a paddle wheel or propeller to move the ship. The steam was produced in a boiler using wood or coal and fed through a steam external combustion engine. Now most ships have an internal combustion engine using a slightly refined type of petroleum called bunker fuel. Some ships, such as submarines, use nuclear power to produce the steam. Recreational or educational craft still use wind power, while some smaller craft use internal combustion engines to drive one or more propellers, or in the case of jet boats, an inboard water jet. In shallow draft areas, hovercraft are propelled by large pusher-prop fans. (See Marine propulsion.) Although it is slow compared to other transport, modern sea transport is a highly efficient method of transporting large quantities of goods. Commercial vessels, nearly 35,000 in number, carried 7.4 billion tons of cargo in 2007.The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) 2007, p. x and p. 32. Transport by water is significantly less costly than air transport for transcontinental shipping;Stopford, 1997: 4‚Äì6 short sea shipping and ferries remain viable in coastal areas.Stopford, 1997: 8‚Äì9Cooper et al., 1998: 280 =Other modes= alt=Oil pipeline winding through cold Alaskan country-side. In the background are mountains, partly snow-capped Pipeline transport sends goods through a pipe; most commonly liquid and gases are sent, but pneumatic tubes can also send solid capsules using compressed air. For liquids/gases, any chemically stable liquid or gas can be sent through a pipeline. Short-distance systems exist for sewage, slurry, water and beer, while long-distance networks are used for petroleum and natural gas. Cable transport is a broad mode where vehicles are pulled by cables instead of an internal power source. It is most commonly used at steep gradient. Typical solutions include aerial tramway, elevators, escalator and ski lifts; some of these are also categorized as conveyor transport. Spaceflight is transport out of Earth's atmosphere into outer space by means of a spacecraft. While large amounts of research have gone into technology, it is rarely used except to put satellites into orbit, and conduct scientific experiments. However, man has landed on the moon, and probes have been sent to all the planets of the Solar System. Suborbital spaceflight is the fastest of the existing and planned transport systems from a place on Earth to a distant \\"other place\\" on Earth. Faster transport could be achieved through part of a low Earth orbit, or following that trajectory even faster using the propulsion of the rocket to steer it. Elements=Infrastructure= Bridges, such as Golden Gate Bridge, allow roads and railways to cross bodies of water. Infrastructure is the fixed installations that allow a vehicle to operate. It consists of a roadway, a terminal, and facilities for parking and maintenance. For rail, pipeline, road and cable transport, the entire way the vehicle travels must be constructed. Air and watercraft are able to avoid this, since the airway and seaway do not need to be constructed. However, they require fixed infrastructure at terminals. Terminals such as airports, ports, and stations, are locations where passengers and freight can be transferred from one vehicle or mode to another. For passenger transport, terminals are integrating different modes to allow riders, who are interchanging between modes, to take advantage of each mode's benefits. For instance, airport rail links connect airports to the city centers and suburbs. The terminals for automobiles are parking lots, while buses and coaches can operate from simple stops.Cooper et al., 1998: 275‚Äì76 For freight, terminals act as transshipment points, though some cargo is transported directly from the point of production to the point of use. The financing of infrastructure can either be public or private. Transport is often a natural monopoly and a necessity for the public; roads, and in some countries railways and airports are funded through taxation. New infrastructure projects can have high costs and are often financed through debt. Many infrastructure owners, therefore, impose usage fees, such as landing fees at airports, or toll plazas on roads. Independent of this, authorities may impose taxes on the purchase or use of vehicles. Because of poor forecasting and overestimation of passenger numbers by planners, there is frequently a benefits shortfall for transport infrastructure projects.Bent Flyvbjerg, Mette K. Skamris Holm, and S√∏ren L. Buhl, \\"How (In)Accurate Are Demand Forecasts in Public Works Projects\\", Journal of the American Planning Association 71:2, pp. 131‚Äì46. =Vehicles= A Fiat Uno in 2018 A vehicle is a non-living device that is used to move people and goods. Unlike the infrastructure, the vehicle moves along with the cargo and riders. Unless being pulled/pushed by a cable or muscle-power, the vehicle must provide its own propulsion; this is most commonly done through a steam engine, combustion engine, electric motor, a jet engine or a rocket, though other means of propulsion also exist. Vehicles also need a system of converting the energy into movement; this is most commonly done through wheels, propellers and pressure. Vehicles are most commonly staffed by a driver. However, some systems, such as people movers and some rapid transits, are fully automated. For passenger transport, the vehicle must have a compartment, seat, or platform for the passengers. Simple vehicles, such as automobiles, bicycles or simple aircraft, may have one of the passengers as a driver. =Operation= alt=Tilted aerial view of modern airport. Aircraft are parked next to \\"arms\\" that extend from the central building Private transport is only subject to the owner of the vehicle, who operates the vehicle themselves. For public transport and freight transport, operations are done through private enterprise or by governments. The infrastructure and vehicles may be owned and operated by the same company, or they may be operated by different entities. Traditionally, many countries have had a national airline and national railway. Since the 1980s, many of these have been privatized. International shipping remains a highly competitive industry with little regulation,Stopford, 1997: 422 but ports can be public-owned.Stopford, 1997: 29 =Policy= As the population of the world increases, cities grow in size and population‚Äîaccording to the United Nations, 55% of the world‚Äôs population live in cities, and by 2050 this number is expected to rise to 68%. Public transport policy must evolve to meet the changing priorities of the urban world. The institution of policy enforces order in transport, which is by nature chaotic as people attempt to travel from one place to another as fast as possible. This policy helps to reduce accidents and save lives. Functions Relocation of travelers and cargo are the most common uses of transport. However, other uses exist, such as the strategic and tactical relocation of armed forces during warfare, or the civilian mobility construction or emergency equipment. =Passenger= A local transit bus operated by alt=Light green, orange and white bus stopping in front of multi- story building. Passenger transport, or travel, is divided into public and private transport. Public transport is scheduled services on fixed routes, while private is vehicles that provide ad hoc services at the riders desire. The latter offers better flexibility, but has lower capacity, and a higher environmental impact. Travel may be as part of daily commuting, for business, leisure or migration. Short-haul transport is dominated by the automobile and mass transit. The latter consists of buses in rural and small cities, supplemented with commuter rail, trams and rapid transit in larger cities. Long-haul transport involves the use of the automobile, trains, coaches and aircraft, the last of which have become predominantly used for the longest, including intercontinental, travel. Intermodal passenger transport is where a journey is performed through the use of several modes of transport; since all human transport normally starts and ends with walking, all passenger transport can be considered intermodal. Public transport may also involve the intermediate change of vehicle, within or across modes, at a transport hub, such as a bus or railway station. Taxis and buses can be found on both ends of the public transport spectrum. Buses are the cheapest mode of transport but are not necessarily flexible, and taxis are very flexible but more expensive. In the middle is demand-responsive transport, offering flexibility whilst remaining affordable. International travel may be restricted for some individuals due to legislation and visa requirements. =Medical= An ambulance from World War IAn ambulance is a vehicle used to transport people from or between places of treatment,Skinner, Henry Alan. 1949, \\"The Origin of Medical Terms\\". Baltimore: Williams & Wilkins and in some instances will also provide out-of-hospital medical care to the patient. The word is often associated with road-going \\"emergency ambulances\\", which form part of emergency medical services, administering emergency care to those with acute medical problems. Air medical services is a comprehensive term covering the use of air transport to move patients to and from healthcare facilities and accident scenes. Personnel provide comprehensive prehospital and emergency and critical care to all types of patients during aeromedical evacuation or rescue operations, aboard helicopters, propeller aircraft, or jet aircraft. =Freight= Freight transport, or shipping, is a key in the value chain in manufacturing.Chopra and Meindl, 2007: 3 With increased specialization and globalization, production is being located further away from consumption, rapidly increasing the demand for transport.Chopra and Meindl, 2007: 63‚Äì64 Transport creates place utility by moving the goods from the place of production to the place of consumption. While all modes of transport are used for cargo transport, there is high differentiation between the nature of the cargo transport, in which mode is chosen.Chopra and Meindl, 2007: 54 Logistics refers to the entire process of transferring products from producer to consumer, including storage, transport, transshipment, warehousing, material- handling, and packaging, with associated exchange of information.Bardi, Coyle and Novack, 2006: 4 Incoterm deals with the handling of payment and responsibility of risk during transport.Bardi, Coyle and Novack, 2006: 473 Freight train with shipping containers in the United Kingdom Containerization, with the standardization of ISO containers on all vehicles and at all ports, has revolutionized international and domestic trade, offering a huge reduction in transshipment costs. Traditionally, all cargo had to be manually loaded and unloaded into the haul of any ship or car; containerization allows for automated handling and transfer between modes, and the standardized sizes allow for gains in economy of scale in vehicle operation. This has been one of the key driving factors in international trade and globalization since the 1950s.Bardi, Coyle and Novack, 2006: 211‚Äì14 Bulk transport is common with cargo that can be handled roughly without deterioration; typical examples are ore, coal, cereals and petroleum. Because of the uniformity of the product, mechanical handling can allow enormous quantities to be handled quickly and efficiently. The low value of the cargo combined with high volume also means that economies of scale become essential in transport, and gigantic ships and whole trains are commonly used to transport bulk. Liquid products with sufficient volume may also be transported by pipeline. Air freight has become more common for products of high value; while less than one percent of world transport by volume is by airline, it amounts to forty percent of the value. Time has become especially important in regards to principles such as postponement and just-in-time within the value chain, resulting in a high willingness to pay for quick delivery of key components or items of high value-to-weight ratio.Chopra and Meindl, 2007: 328 In addition to mail, common items sent by air include electronics and fashion clothing. Impact=Economic= Transport is a key component of growth and globalization, such as in alt=Skyline of city at dawn. A major highway winds itself into the downtown area. Transport is a key necessity for specialization‚Äîallowing production and consumption of products to occur at different locations. Throughout history, transport has been a spur to expansion; better transport allows more trade and a greater spread of people. Economic growth has always been dependent on increasing the capacity and rationality of transport.Stopford, 1997: 2 But the infrastructure and operation of transport have a great impact on the land, and transport is the largest drainer of energy, making transport sustainability a major issue. Due to the way modern cities and communities are planned and operated, a physical distinction between home and work is usually created, forcing people to transport themselves to places of work, study, or leisure, as well as to temporarily relocate for other daily activities. Passenger transport is also the essence of tourism, a major part of recreational transport. Commerce requires the transport of people to conduct business, either to allow face-to-face communication for important decisions or to move specialists from their regular place of work to sites where they are needed. =Planning= Transport planning allows for high utilization and less impact regarding new infrastructure. Using models of transport forecasting, planners are able to predict future transport patterns. On the operative level, logistics allows owners of cargo to plan transport as part of the supply chain. Transport as a field is also studied through transport economics, a component for the creation of regulation policy by authorities. Transport engineering, a sub- discipline of civil engineering, must take into account trip generation, trip distribution, mode choice and route assignment, while the operative level is handled through traffic engineering. The engineering of this alt=Aerial view of roundabout, a junction of several streets. Vehicles traverse around the roundabout, which is surrounded by buildings, mostly multi-storey Because of the negative impacts incurred, transport often becomes the subject of controversy related to choice of mode, as well as increased capacity. Automotive transport can be seen as a tragedy of the commons, where the flexibility and comfort for the individual deteriorate the natural and urban environment for all. Density of development depends on mode of transport, with public transport allowing for better spatial utilization. Good land use keeps common activities close to people's homes and places higher-density development closer to transport lines and hubs, to minimize the need for transport. There are economies of agglomeration. Beyond transport, some land uses are more efficient when clustered. Transport facilities consume land, and in cities pavement (devoted to streets and parking) can easily exceed 20 percent of the total land use. An efficient transport system can reduce land waste. Too much infrastructure and too much smoothing for maximum vehicle throughput mean that in many cities there is too much traffic and many‚Äîif not all‚Äîof the negative impacts that come with it. It is only in recent years that traditional practices have started to be questioned in many places; as a result of new types of analysis which bring in a much broader range of skills than those traditionally relied on‚Äîspanning such areas as environmental impact analysis, public health, sociology and economics‚Äîthe viability of the old mobility solutions is increasingly being questioned. =Environment= alt=Looking down a busy road, which is banked on both sides by tall buildings, some of which are covered in advertisement billboards Transport is a major use of energy and burns most of the world's petroleum. This creates air pollution, including nitrous oxides and particulates, and is a significant contributor to global warming through emission of carbon dioxide, for which transport is the fastest-growing emission sector. By sub-sector, road transport is the largest contributor to global warming. Environmental regulations in developed countries have reduced individual vehicles' emissions; however, this has been offset by increases in the numbers of vehicles and in the use of each vehicle. Some pathways to reduce the carbon emissions of road vehicles considerably have been studied.Data on the barriers and motivators to more sustainable transport behaviour is available in the UK Department for Transport study \\"Climate Change and Transport Choices \\" published in December 2010. Energy use and emissions vary largely between modes, causing environmentalists to call for a transition from air and road to rail and human-powered transport, as well as increased transport electrification and energy efficiency. Other environmental impacts of transport systems include traffic congestion and automobile-oriented urban sprawl, which can consume natural habitat and agricultural lands. By reducing transport emissions globally, it is predicted that there will be significant positive effects on Earth's air quality, acid rain, smog and climate change. While Tesla is an automobile manufacturing company that is building electric cars to cut down CO2 emission, an approach that is becoming popular among cities worldwide is to prioritise public transport and cycles over cars, creating 20-minute neighbourhoods that drastically reduce travel time and levying a congestion charge in cars for travelling to already congested areas during peak time. = Sustainable development = There are various Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that are promoting sustainable transport in order to meet the defined goals. These include SDG 3 on health (increased road safety), SDG 7 on energy, SDG 8 on decent work and economic growth, SDG 9 on resilient infrastructure, SDG 11 on sustainable cities (access to transport and expanded public transport), SDG 12 on sustainable consumption and production (ending fossil fuel subsidies) and SDG 14 on oceans, seas and marine resources.  History  Bronocice pot with the earliest known image of a wheeled vehicle in the world, found in Poland bullock team hauling wool in Australia Humans' first means of transport involved walking, running and swimming. The domestication of animals introduced a new way to lay the burden of transport on more powerful creatures, allowing the hauling of heavier loads, or humans riding animals for greater speed and duration. Inventions such as the wheel and the sled (U.K. sledge) helped make animal transport more efficient through the introduction of vehicles. Water transport, including rowed and sailed vessels, dates back to time immemorial, and was the only efficient way to transport large quantities or over large distances prior to the Industrial Revolution. The first forms of road transport involved animals, such as horses (domesticated in the 4th or the 3rd millennium BCE), oxen (from about 8000 BCE) or humans carrying goods over dirt tracks that often followed game trails. Many early civilizations, including those in Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley, constructed paved roads. In classical antiquity, the Persian and Roman empires built stone-paved roads to allow armies to travel quickly. Deep roadbeds of crushed stone underneath kept such roads dry. The medieval Caliphate later built tar-paved roads. The first watercraft were canoes cut out from tree trunks. Early water transport was accomplished with ships that were either rowed or used the wind for propulsion, or a combination of the two. The importance of water has led to most cities that grew up as sites for trading being located on rivers or on the sea-shore, often at the intersection of two bodies of water. Until the Industrial Revolution, transport remained slow and costly, and production and consumption gravitated as close to each other as feasible. =Mechanical= The Wright brothers' first flight in 1903 The Industrial Revolution in the 19th century saw a number of inventions fundamentally change transport. With telegraphy, communication became instant and independent of the transport of physical objects. The invention of the steam engine, closely followed by its application in rail transport, made land transport independent of human or animal muscles. Both speed and capacity increased, allowing specialization through manufacturing being located independently of natural resources. The 19th century also saw the development of the steam ship, which sped up global transport. With the development of the combustion engine and the automobile around 1900, road transport became more competitive again, and mechanical private transport originated. The first \\"modern\\" highways were constructed during the 19th century with macadam. Later, tarmac and concrete became the dominant paving materials. In 1903 the Wright brothers demonstrated the first successful controllable airplane, and after World War I (1914‚Äì1918) aircraft became a fast way to transport people and express goods over long distances.Bardi, Coyle and Novack, 2006: 158 After World War II (1939‚Äì1945) the automobile and airlines took higher shares of transport, reducing rail and water to freight and short-haul passenger services.Cooper et al., 1998: 277 Scientific spaceflight began in the 1950s, with rapid growth until the 1970s, when interest dwindled. In the 1950s the introduction of containerization gave massive efficiency gains in freight transport, fostering globalization. International air travel became much more accessible in the 1960s with the commercialization of the jet engine. Along with the growth in automobiles and motorways, rail and water transport declined in relative importance. After the introduction of the Shinkansen in Japan in 1964, high-speed rail in Asia and Europe started attracting passengers on long-haul routes away from the airlines. Early in U.S. history, private joint-stock corporations owned most aqueducts, bridges, canals, railroads, roads, and tunnels. Most such transport infrastructure came under government control in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, culminating in the nationalization of inter-city passenger rail-service with the establishment of Amtrak. Recently, however, a movement to privatize roads and other infrastructure has gained some ground and adherents.

One of its main design features is that the user interface is defined in an entirely declarative manner. Web Dynpro applications can be developed using either a Java (Web Dynpro for Java, WDJ or WD4J) or ABAP (Web Dynpro ABAP,SAP Library - Web Dynpro for ABAP WDA or WD4A) flavor. Overview The earliest version of Web Dynpro appeared in 2003 and was based on Java. This variant was released approximately 18 months before the ABAP variant. The Java variant of Web Dynpro experienced limited commercial success, and as of 2010, has been placed in maintenance. This means that the existing product is supported to the extent that any bugs are fixed; however, no new functionality will be added. SAP's development effort is now focused on the ABAP variant of Web Dynpro. WD follows a design architecture based on an interpretation of the MVC design pattern and uses a model driven development approach (\\"minimize coding, maximize design\\"). The Web Dynpro Framework is a server-side runtime environment into which many dedicated \\"hook methods\\" are available. The developer then places their own custom coding within these hook methods in order to implement the desired business functionality. These hook methods belong to one of the broad categories of either \\"life-cycle\\" and \\"round-trip\\"; that is, those methods that are concerned with the life-cycle of a software component (i.e. processing that takes place at start up and shut down etc.), and those methods that are concerned with processing the fixed sequence of events that take place during a client-initiated round trip to the server. Web Dynpro is aimed at the development of business applications that follow standardized UI principles, applications that connect to backend systems and which are scalable.  Main disadvantages  * renders improperly (or not at all) in any browser but Internet Explorer, not even in newer versions without using the compatibility view.How to resolve \\"Sorry, your browser/program is not supported by Web Dynpro\\" for IE 9. * proprietary codebase, only operates on SAP servers * some bundled UI elements are reproductions of standard HTML elements (e.g. drop-down menus) and do not gracefully degrade * HTML generated by WD is neither semantic nor readily readable: many UI layout elements are combinations of deeply nested tables, divs, and spans. For example, rather than utilizing a fieldset (two elements including legend) for the Group UI element, WD recreates it with two spans surrounding a two row table with further spans, a div, and a wbr for a total of 13 elements. * less flexible due to requirement that interface be made up of WD UI elements (i.e. custom HTML is not possible). To reduce the limitations, several measures have been taken. For example, WD supports so-called \\"islands\\" for e.g. flash applications that enrich the Web Dynpro UI element collection by rich UI elements. This disadvantage doesn't seem so serious but in fact basic features that a user would expect cannot be implemented, e.g. colored rows in a table, colors in general, advanced alignment of simple UI elements (due to nonexistence of more complicated ones), selecting multiple rows in tree-like tables (this is due to preserving basic concept of WD) and many more. Utilizing such an island requires the developer to forgo WD UI elements within. * rendering speed in browser for larger tables.

This is a result of the complex Cross-Strait relations between the Republic of China and the People's Republic of China. The Olympic flag has been in use since 1980, following the decision by the International Olympic Committee that the ROC could not compete under the country's name or flag. Due to this restriction, the National Anthem of the Republic of China also could not be played when the team wins medals, so, instead, the National Flag Anthem of the Republic of China was played during the flag raising of the medal ceremony. The flag shows the Blue Sky with a White Sun (the emblem of the Republic of China and the Kuomintang) and the Olympic rings, encircled by a five-petaled Prunus mei (the ROC's national flower) drawn in red, white, and blue (the colors of the ROC flag).  Court case over IOC decision  The IOC adopted the Nagoya Resolution in November 1979 which called for the \\"Republic of China Olympic Committee\\" to change its name to the \\"Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee\\" and adopt a new flag and anthem if it wanted to participate in the Olympic Games. The ROC strongly disagreed with the decision and sued the IOC in Switzerland.The Times, 24 November 1979 The ROC claimed that the conditions concerning its name, flag, and anthem violated articles 6, 64, and 66 of the Olympic Charter. However, despite appealing an initial court judgment, the ROC was not successful. On 15 January 1980, a Swiss court rejected the ROC effort to remain in the Olympic movement under the name of \\"Republic of China.\\"The Times, January 17, 1980 After a series of forceful objections, Taiwan officially accepted the compromise in 1981, and the island competed in the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo, SFR Yugoslavia.

Since then, it has become increasingly widespread in many parts of the South and South East England, often in association with parks and gardens, where adults are usually seen visiting flowers. Elsewhere in England, only a few scattered records exist. Habitat These hoverflies usually inhabit meadows close to forests. Description Volucella zonaria, male Volucella zonaria can reach a length of ,Stuart Ball, Roger Morris Britain's Hoverflies: A Field Guide, Revised and Updated Second Edition with a wingspan of about 40 mm.Richard Jones House Guests, House Pests: A Natural History of Animals in the Home These very large and wide hoverflies have reddish-brown shining thorax with dark brown marks, and a reddish-brown scutellum. The head shows a waxy yellow face, with yellow forehead and antennae. The large ovoid compound eyes are reddish with dense and short hairy. In the males they are very close to each other, so that the forehead is very narrow. The abdomen is reddish yellow, with two wide black bands. The underside has broad black bars. The first abdominal segment is black. The 2nd tergite is chestnut brown. Wings are amber infused. The legs are basically red-brown, but black at the base.Nature- lexicon This species mimics the European hornet (Vespa crabro), by its size, by its appearance and its buzzing flight. Biology Volucella zonaria feeding on nectar Adults can be found from May to September, but they are most common in July / August. Like all Volucella, the adults of these hoverflies are migratory. Volucella zonaria is a Mediterranean migratory species. These hoverflies mainly feed on nectar of flowers of various plants, especially Valeriana, Oregano, Mentha longifolia, Scabiosa, Cornus, Ligustrum, Cirsium, Carduus, Buddleia and various other flowering shrubs. Females lay their eggs in wasp and hornet nests. The larvae live as commensals in nests of bees, hornets and of social wasps of the genus Vespula. The pupae overwinter in the soil and hatch in following spring.

Almedingen (born Marta Aleksandrovna Almedingen, also known as Martha Edith Almedingen or von Almedingen) (1898‚Äì1971) was a British novelist, biographer, children's author, and member of the Royal Society of Literature.  Family  On her mother's side, she was descended from the aristocratic Poltoratsky family; her maternal grandfather was Serge Poltoratzky, the literary scholar and bibliophile who ended his days in exile, shuttling between France and England. His second wife, Ellen Sarah Southee, the daughter of an English gentleman farmer, grew up in Kent. She was related to poet Robert Southey. Their children had English governesses and grew up speaking English. Their daughter and the novelist's mother, Olga Sergeevna, grew up in Kent‚Äî but, fascinated by her father's native Russian, moved to Russia in 1800s. There, she married Alexander Almedingen,E. M. Almedingen, Tomorrow Will Come (Holt Rinehart Winston, 1968), p. 19. who had turned his back on his family's military traditions to become a scientist.  Early life  After her father abandoned his family in 1900, they increasingly lived in impoverishment. Despite this, the author was able to attend the Xenia Institute in 1913 and eke out a living in the increasingly desperate times of the Russian revolution and civil war. She received the highest honors in history and literature at Xenia. She transferred from Xenia to Petrograd University in 1916, where she attended until she earned her first doctorate in 1920.  Career  From 1920, Almedingen taught English history and literature at Petrograd University. She then emigrated to England in 1923, where she began work as a journalist. In parallel, she dabbled in fiction writing with works such as ‚ÄúAn Examination in Diplomacy‚Äù, before ultimately going on to publish upwards of 60 books over the next several decades. Despite her wide range of work from biography to poetry, she became well-known for her children's novels in particular. Almedingen wrote two historical novels: The Lion of the North (1938), about Charles XII of Sweden, and Fair Haven (1956), about Peter the Great. In 1951, she became a lecturer in Russian literature at Oxford University. In 1941 she won the $5,000 Atlantic Monthly nonfiction prize for one of her autobiographical works, Tomorrow Will Come. Five years later she moved to Frogmore, a house near Upton Magna in Shropshire, where she remained until her death.

Currently, about 1,000 species have been identified. The term tarantula is usually used to describe members of the family Theraphosidae, although many other members of the same infraorder (Mygalomorphae) are commonly referred to as \\"tarantulas\\" or \\"false tarantulas\\". Some of the more common species have become popular in the exotic pet trade. Many New World species kept as pets have urticating hairs that can cause irritation to the skin, and in extreme cases, cause damage to the eyes.  Overview  Like all arthropods, the tarantula is an invertebrate that relies on an exoskeleton for muscular support.Pomeroy, R. (2014, February 4). Pub.

Like other Arachnida, a tarantula's body comprises two main parts, the prosoma (or cephalothorax) and the opisthosoma (or abdomen). The prosoma and opisthosoma are connected by the pedicel, or pregenital somite. This waist-like connecting piece is actually part of the prosoma and gives the opisthosoma a wide range of motion relative to the prosoma.

Leg span is determined by measuring from the tip of the back leg to the tip of the front leg on the opposite side. Some of the largest species of tarantula may weigh over ; the largest of all, the goliath birdeater (Theraphosa blondi) from Venezuela and Brazil, has been reported to attain a weight of and a leg-span up to , males being longer and females greater in girth. The fang size of this tarantula reaches a maximum of . Opening to a tarantula burrow Theraphosa apophysis (the pinkfoot goliath) was described 187 years after the goliath birdeater, so its characteristics are not as well attested. T. blondi is generally thought to be the heaviest tarantula, and T. apophysis has the greatest leg span. Two other species, Lasiodora parahybana (the Brazilian salmon birdeater) and Lasiodora klugi, rival the size of the two goliath spiders. Tarantula at the mouth of its burrow Most species of North American tarantulas are brown. Elsewhere, species have been found that variously display cobalt blue (Cyriopagopus lividus), black with white stripes (Aphonopelma seemanni), yellow leg markings (Eupalaestrus campestratus), metallic blue legs with vibrant orange abdomen and green prosoma (Chromatopelma cyaneopubescens). Their natural habitats include savanna, grassland such as in the pampas, rainforest, desert, scrubland, mountains, and cloud forest. They are generally classed among the terrestrial types. They are burrowers that live in the ground. Tarantulas are becoming increasingly popular as pets and some species are readily available in captivity.  Etymology  The spider originally bearing the name \\"tarantula\\" was Lycosa tarantula, a species of wolf spider native to Mediterranean Europe.Fabre, Jean-Henri; Translated by Alexander Teixeira de Mattos (1916) The Life of the spider, Dodd, Mead, New York. The name is derived from the southern Italian town of Taranto. The term \\"tarantula\\" was subsequently applied to almost any large, unfamiliar species of ground- dwelling spider, in particular to the Mygalomorphae and especially the New World Theraphosidae. Compared to tarantulas, wolf spiders are not particularly large or ‚Ä≥hairy‚Ä≥, and so among English speakers in particular, usage eventually shifted in favour of the Theraphosidae, even though they are not closely related to wolf spiders at all, being in a different infraorder. A tarantula next to a U.S. size 11 shoe, to show scale, taken near Austin, Texas Aphonopelma mojave. Tarantula native to the Mojave Desert searches for a burrow. The name \\"tarantula\\" is also incorrectly applied to other large-bodied spiders, including the purseweb spiders or atypical tarantulas, the funnel- webs (Dipluridae and Hexathelidae), and the \\"dwarf tarantulas\\". These spiders are related to tarantulas (all being mygalomorphs), but are classified in different families. Huntsman spiders of the family Sparassidae have also been termed \\"tarantulas\\" because of their large size, when, in fact, they are not related, and instead belong to the infraorder Araneomorphae. =The element pelma in genus names= Many theraphosid genera have names, either accepted or synonymous, containing the element pelma. This can be traced back to Carl Ludwig Koch in 1850, who in describing his new genus Eurypelma wrote \\"\\", literally 'the velvet-brush of the footsole very wide'. German arachnologists use the word to refer to the tarsus (the last article of a spider's leg). Translations of into Latin use the word . Hence in English arachnological terminology, Koch meant 'the scopula of the base of the tarsus very wide'. Eury- is derived from the Greek , meaning 'wide', while (pelma) means 'the sole of the foot', thus paralleling Koch's use of (in modern spelling). Thus Eurypelma literally means 'wide footsole'; however, arachnologists have conventionally taken pelma in such names to refer to the scopula, so producing the meaning 'with a wide scopula'. Other genus names or synonyms that Estrada- Alvarez and Cameron regard as having 'footsole' or 'scopula' meanings include: *Acanthopelma ‚Äì Greek (acantha) 'thorn, spine'; overall meaning 'spiny footsole' *Brachypelma ‚Äì Greek (brachys) 'short'; overall meaning 'short scopula' *Metriopelma ‚Äì Greek (metrios) 'of moderate size'; overall meaning 'medium length scopula' *Schizopelma ‚Äì from the Greek origin combining form schizo- 'split'; overall meaning 'split footsole' *Sericopelma ‚Äì Greek (serikos) 'silky'; overall meaning 'silken scopula' Later, particularly following genus names published by R.I. Pocock in 1901, the element pelma appears to have become synonymous with 'theraphosid'. For example, the author of Cardiopelma says \\"\\" (Cardiopelma refers to the female genitalia that evoke the shape of a heart), with no reference to either 'footsole' or 'scopula'. Names interpreted in this way include: *Aphonopelma ‚Äì Greek (aphonos) 'soundless'; overall meaning 'theraphosid without sound' *Cardiopelma ‚Äì Greek (cardia) 'heart'; overall meaning 'heart theraphosid' (referring to the heart- shaped female genitalia) *Clavopelma ‚Äì Latin 'club'; overall meaning 'theraphosid with club-shaped hairs' *Delopelma ‚Äì Greek (delos) 'clear, obvious, visible, conspicuous, plain'; overall meaning 'theraphosid without plumose hair' *Gosipelma ‚Äì the element gosi- means 'desert', relating to the Gosiute people; overall meaning 'desert theraphosid' *Spelopelma ‚Äì Greek (spelaion) 'cave'; overall meaning 'cave theraphosid'  Distribution  Tarantulas of various species occur throughout the United States, Mexico, in Central America, and throughout South America. Other species occur variously throughout Africa, much of Asia (including the Ryukyu Islands in southern Japan), and all of Australia. In Europe, some species occur in Spain, Portugal, Turkey, southern Italy, and Cyprus.  Habits  Some genera of tarantulas hunt prey primarily in trees; others hunt on or near the ground. All tarantulas can produce silk; while arboreal species typically reside in a silken \\"tube tent\\", terrestrial species line their burrows with silk to stabilize the burrow wall and facilitate climbing up and down. Tarantulas mainly eat large insects and other arthropods such as centipedes, millipedes, and other spiders, using ambush as their primary method of prey capture. Armed with their massive, powerful chelicerae tipped with long, chitinous fangs, tarantulas are well-adapted to killing other large arthropods. The biggest tarantulas sometimes kill and consume small vertebrates such as lizards, mice, bats, birds, and small snakes.  Appendages  Subadult female Poecilotheria regalis The eight legs, the two chelicerae with their fangs, and the pedipalps are attached to the prosoma. The chelicerae are two double-segmented appendages located just below the eyes and directly forward of the mouth. The chelicerae contain the venom glands that vent through the fangs. The fangs are hollow extensions of the chelicerae that inject venom into prey or animals that the tarantula bites in defense, and they are also used to masticate. These fangs are articulated so that they can extend downward and outward in preparation to bite or can fold back toward the chelicerae as a pocket knife blade folds back into its handle. The chelicerae of a tarantula completely contain the venom glands and the muscles that surround them, and can cause the venom to be forcefully injected into prey. The pedipalpi are two six-segmented appendages connected to the prosoma near the mouth and protruding on either side of both chelicerae. In most species of tarantulas, the pedipalpi contain sharp, jagged plates used to cut and crush food often called the coxae or maxillae. As with other spiders, the terminal portions of the pedipalpi of males function as part of their reproductive system. Male spiders spin a silken platform (sperm web) on the ground onto which they release semen from glands in their opisthosoma. Then they insert their pedipalps into the semen, absorb the semen into the pedipalps, and later insert the pedipalps (one at a time) into the reproductive organ of the female, which is located in her abdomen. The terminal segments of the pedipalps of male tarantulas are moderately larger in circumference than those of a female tarantula. Male tarantulas have special spinnerets surrounding the genital opening. Silk for the sperm web of the tarantula is exuded from these special spinnerets. Claws at the end of the leg of Lasiodora parahybana A Brazilian tarantula in defensively threatening position A tarantula has four pairs of legs and two additional pairs of appendages. Each leg has seven segments, which from the prosoma out are: coxa, trochanter, femur, patella, tibia, tarsus and pretarsus, and claw. Two or three retractable claws at the end of each leg are used to grip surfaces for climbing. Also on the end of each leg, surrounding the claws, is a group of bristles, called the scopula, which help the tarantula to grip better when climbing surfaces such as glass. The fifth pair is the pedipalps, which aid in feeling, gripping prey, and mating in the case of a mature male. The sixth pair of appendages is the chelicerae and their attached fangs. When walking, a tarantula's first and third legs on one side move at the same time as the second and fourth legs on the other side of its body. The muscles in a tarantula's legs cause the legs to bend at the joints, but to extend a leg, the tarantula increases the pressure of haemolymph entering the leg. Tarantulas, like almost all other spiders, have their primary spinnerets at the end of the opisthosoma. Unlike most spider species in the infraorder Araneomorphae, which includes the majority of extant spider species, and most of which have six, tarantula species have two or four spinnerets. Spinnerets are flexible, tube-like structures from which the spider exudes its silk. The tip of each spinneret is called the spinning field. Each spinning field is covered by as many as 100 spinning tubes through which silk is exuded. As the silk is pulled out of the spinnerets, the shear forces cause proteins in the silk to crystallize, transforming it from a liquid to a solid thread.  Digestive system  Tarantula food leftovers Eye ports seen in an exuvia (molted skin) The tarantula's mouth is located under its chelicerae on the lower front part of its prosoma. The mouth is a short, straw-shaped opening that can only suck, meaning that anything taken into it must be in liquid form. Prey with large amounts of solid parts, such as mice, must be crushed and ground up or predigested, which is accomplished by coating the prey with digestive juices secreted from openings in the chelicerae. The tarantula's digestive organ (stomach) is a tube that runs the length of its body. In the prosoma, this tube is wider and forms the sucking stomach. When the sucking stomach's powerful muscles contract, the stomach is increased in cross-section, creating a strong sucking action that permits the tarantula to suck its liquefied prey up through the mouth and into the intestines. Once the liquefied food enters the intestines, it is broken down into particles small enough to pass through the intestine walls into the hemolymph (blood stream), where it is distributed throughout the body. After feeding, the leftovers are formed into a small ball by the tarantula and thrown away. In a terrarium, they often put them into the same corner.Kova≈ô√≠k, F (2001), Chov skl√≠pkan≈Ø (Keeping Tarantulas); Madagaskar, Jihlava, p. 23  Nervous system  A tarantula's central nervous system (brain) is located in the bottom of the inner prosoma. A tarantula perceives its surroundings primarily via sensory organs called setae (bristles or spines). Although a tarantula has eight eyes like most spiders, touch is its keenest sense, and in hunting, it primarily depends on vibrations given off by the movements of its prey. A tarantula's setae are very sensitive organs and are used to sense chemical signatures, vibrations, wind direction, and possibly even sound. Tarantulas are also very responsive to the presence of certain chemicals such as pheromones. Close-up of a tarantula's eyes The eyes are located above the chelicerae on the forward part of the prosoma. They are small and usually set in two rows of four. Most tarantulas are not able to see much more than light, darkness, and motion. Arboreal tarantulas generally have better vision compared with terrestrial tarantulas.  Respiratory system  All types of tarantulas have two sets of book lungs (breathing organs); the first pair is located in a cavity inside the lower front part of the abdomen near where the abdomen connects to the cephalothorax, and the second pair is slightly farther back on the abdomen. Air enters the cavity through a tiny slit on each side of and near the front of the abdomen. Each lung consists of 15 or more thin sheets of folded tissue arranged like the pages of a book. These sheets of tissue are supplied by blood vessels. As air enters each lung, oxygen is taken into the blood stream through the blood vessels in the lungs. Needed moisture may also be absorbed from humid air by these organs.  Circulatory system  Thermal image of an ectothermic tarantula on an endothermic human hand A tarantula's blood is unique (not only in appearance); an oxygen-transporting protein is present (the copper-based hemocyanin), but not enclosed in blood cells such as the erythrocytes of mammals. A tarantula's blood is not true blood, but rather a liquid called haemolymph, or hemolymph. At least four types of hemocytes, or hemolymph cells, are known. The tarantula's heart is a long, slender tube located along the top of the opisthosoma. The heart is neurogenic as opposed to myogenic, so nerve cells instead of muscle cells initiate and coordinate the heart. The heart pumps hemolymph to all parts of the body through open passages often referred to as sinuses, and not through a circular system of blood vessels. If the exoskeleton is breached, loss of hemolymph will kill the tarantula unless the wound is small enough that the hemolymph can dry and close the wound.  Predators  Despite their large size and fearsome appearance and reputation, tarantulas themselves are prey for many other animals. The most specialized of these predators are large members of the wasp family Pompilidae such as the wasp Hemipepsis ustulata. These wasps are called \\"tarantula hawks\\". The largest tarantula hawks, such as those in the genus Pepsis, track, attack, and kill large tarantulas. They use olfaction to find the lair of a tarantula. The wasp must deliver a sting to the underside of the spider's cephalothorax, exploiting the thin membrane between the basal leg segments. This paralyzes the spider, and the wasp then drags it back into its burrow before depositing an egg on the prey's abdomen. The wasp then seals the spider in its burrow and flies off to search for more hosts. The wasp egg hatches into a larva and feeds on the spider's inessential parts, and as it approaches pupation, it consumes the remainder.Piper, R (2007) Extraordinary Animals: An Encyclopedia of Curious and Unusual Animals, Greenwood Press, . Other arthropods, such as large scorpions and giant centipedes, are also known to prey on tarantulas. Tarantulas are also preyed upon by a wide variety of vertebrates. Many of these, including lizards, frogs, birds, and mammals, are generalist predators of all kinds of large arthropods. Mammals that have been known to prey on tarantulas, such as the coati, kinkajou, and opossum in the New World, and mongooses and the honey badger in the Old World, are often immune to the venom of their arthropod prey. Humans also consume tarantulas for food in their native ranges. They are considered a delicacy in certain cultures (e.g. Venezuela and Cambodia). They can be roasted over an open fire to remove the bristles (described further below) and then eaten. Fried tarantula in a Cambodian restaurant Adult female Brachypelma smithi, showing a bald patch after kicking bristles off her abdomen Tarantulas have evolved specialized bristles, or setae, to defend themselves against predators. Besides the normal bristles covering the body, some tarantulas also have a dense covering of irritating bristles called urticating hairs, on the opisthosoma, that they sometimes use as protection against enemies. These bristles are present on most New World species, but not on any specimens from the Old World. Urticating hairs are usually kicked off the abdomen by the tarantula, but some may simply rub the abdomen against the target, like the genus Avicularia. These fine bristles are barbed and serve to irritate. They can be lethal to small animals such as rodents. Some people are sensitive to these bristles, and develop serious itching and rashes at the site. Exposure of the eyes and respiratory system to urticating hairs should be strictly avoided. Species with urticating hairs can kick these bristles off; they are flicked into the air at a target using their back pairs of legs. Tarantulas also use these bristles for other purposes, such as to mark territory or to line their shelters (the latter such practice may discourage flies from feeding on the spiderlings). Urticating hairs do not grow back, but are replaced with each molt. The intensity, number, and flotation of the bristles depends on the species of tarantula. To predators and other enemies, these bristles can range from being lethal to simply being a deterrent. With humans, they can cause irritation to eyes, nose, and skin, and more dangerously, the lungs and airways, if inhaled. The symptoms range from species to species, from person to person, from a burning itch to a minor rash. In some cases, tarantula bristles have caused permanent damage to human eyes. Some setae are used to stridulate, which makes a hissing sound. These bristles are usually found on the chelicerae. Stridulation seems to be more common in Old World species.  Bites and urticating bristles  L. parahybana, chelicerae of an adult female All tarantulas are venomous and some bites cause serious discomfort that might persist for several days. In general, the effects of the bites of all kinds of tarantula are not well known. While the bites of many species are known to be no worse than a wasp sting, accounts of bites by some species are reported to be very painful and to produce intense spasms that may recur over a period of several days; the venom of the African tarantula Pelinobius muticus also causes strong hallucinations. For Poecilotheria species, researchers have described more than 20 bites with the delayed onset of severe and diffuse muscle cramps, lasting for several days, that in most cases resolved completely with the use of benzodiazepines and magnesium. In all cases, seeking medical aid is advised. Because other proteins are included when a toxin is injected, some individuals may suffer severe symptoms due to an allergic reaction rather than to the venom. Such allergic effects can be life-threatening. Additionally, the large fangs of a tarantula can inflict painful puncture wounds, which can lead to secondary bacterial infections if not properly treated. Before biting, a tarantula may signal its intention to attack by rearing up into a \\"threat posture\\", which may involve raising its prosoma and lifting its front legs into the air, spreading and extending its fangs, and (in certain species) making a loud hissing by stridulating. Tarantulas often hold this position for longer than the duration of the original threat. Their next step, short of biting, may be to slap down on the intruder with their raised front legs. If that response fails to deter the attacker, the tarantulas of the Americas may next turn away and flick urticating hairs toward the pursuing predator. The next response may be to leave the scene entirely, but especially if no line of retreat is available, their final response may also be to whirl suddenly and bite. Some tarantulas are well known to give \\"dry bites\\", i.e., they may defensively bite some animal that intrudes on their space and threatens them, but they do not pump venom into the wound. Most New World tarantulas are equipped with urticating hairs on their abdomens, and almost always throw these barbed bristles as the first line of defense. These bristles irritate sensitive areas of the body and especially seem to target curious animals that may sniff these bristles into the mucous membranes of the nose. Some species have more effective urticating bristles than others. The goliath birdeater is known for its particularly irritating urticating bristles. They can penetrate the cornea, so eye protection should be worn when handling such tarantulas.Tarantula shoots sharp bristles into owner‚Äôs eye NBC News/LiveScience Old World tarantulas have no urticating bristles and are more likely to attack when disturbed. They often have more potent, medically significant venom, and are faster and much more nervous and defensive than New World species. Some dangerous spider species are related to tarantulas and are frequently confused with them. A popular urban legend maintains that deadly varieties of tarantula exist somewhere in South America. This claim is often made without identifying a particular spider, although the \\"banana tarantula\\" is sometimes named. A likely candidate for the true identity of this spider is the dangerous Brazilian wandering spider (Phoneutria fera) of the family Ctenidae, as it is sometimes found hiding in clusters of bananas and is one of several spiders called \\"banana spiders\\". It is not technically a tarantula, but it is fairly large (4- to 5-inch legspan), somewhat ‚Ä≥hairy‚Ä≥, and is highly venomous to humans. Another dangerous type of spiders that have been confused with tarantulas are the Australian funnel-web spiders. The best known species of these is the Sydney funnel-web spider (Atrax robustus) a spider that is aggressive, highly venomous, and (prior to the development of antivenom in the 1980s) was responsible for numerous deaths in Australia. These spiders are members of the same suborder as tarantulas, Opisthothelae. Some Australians use the slang term \\"triantelope\\" (a corruption of the incorrect term tarantula, which is also used) for large, ‚Ä≥hairy‚Ä≥, and harmless members of the huntsman spider family, which are often found on interior household walls and in automobiles.Huntsman Spiders at The Australian Wonder Book of Knowledge  Sexual dimorphism  Some tarantula species exhibit pronounced sexual dimorphism. Males tend to be smaller (especially their abdomens, which can appear quite narrow) and may be dull in color when compared to their female counterparts, as in the species Haplopelma lividum. Mature male tarantulas also may have tibial hooks on their front legs, which are used to restrain the female's fangs during copulation. Males typically have longer legs than the females. Male California ebony tarantula (Aphonopelma eutylenum) wandering near Exeter, CA A juvenile male's sex can be determined by looking at a cast exuvia for exiandrous fusillae or spermathecae. Females possess spermathecae, except for the species Sickius longibulbi and Encyocratella olivacea. Males have much shorter lifespans than females because they die relatively soon after maturing. Few live long enough for a postultimate molt, which is unlikely in natural habitats because they are vulnerable to predation, but has happened in captivity, though rarely. Most males do not live through this molt, as they tend to get their emboli, mature male sexual organs on pedipalps, stuck in the molt. Most tarantula fanciers regard females as more desirable as pets due to their much longer lifespans. Wild-caught tarantulas are often mature males because they wander out in the open and are more likely to be caught.  Life cycle  The molting process Like other spiders, tarantulas have to shed their exoskeleton periodically to grow, a process called molting. A young tarantula may do this several times a year as a part of the maturation process, while full-grown specimens only molt once a year or less, or sooner, to replace lost limbs or lost urticating hairs. Clearly, molting will soon occur when the exoskeleton takes on a darker shade. If a tarantula previously used its urticating hairs, the bald patch turns from a peach color to deep blue. The tarantula also stops feeding and becomes more lethargic during this time. Tarantulas may live for years; most species take two to five years to reach adulthood, but some species may take up to 10 years to reach full maturity. Upon reaching adulthood, males typically have but a 1.0- to 1.5-year period left to live and immediately go in search of a female with which to mate. Male tarantulas rarely molt again once they reach adulthood, but they may attempt to do so, usually becoming stuck during the molt due to their sexual organs and dying in the process. Females continue to molt after reaching maturity. Female specimens have been known to reach 30 to 40 years of age, and have survived on water alone for up to two years.Schultz, Stanley A. and Schultz, Marguerite J. (1998) The Tarantula Keeper's Guide, Barron's Educational Series, , p. 75 Grammostola rosea spiders are known for only eating once or twice a week and for living up to 20 years in captivity. = Reproduction = The molted skin of a juvenile Phormictopus cancerides cancerides (second molting) After reaching sexual maturity, a female tarantula normally mates and lays eggs once per year, although they do not always do so. As with other spiders, the mechanics of intercourse are quite different from those of mammals. Once a male spider reaches maturity and becomes motivated to mate, he weaves a web mat on a flat surface. The spider then rubs his abdomen on the surface of this mat, and in so doing, releases a quantity of semen. He may then insert his pedipalps (short, leg-like appendages between the chelicerae and front legs) into the pool of semen. The pedipalps absorb the semen and keep it viable until a mate can be found. When a male spider detects the presence of a female, the two exchange signals to establish that they are of the same species. These signals may also lull the female into a receptive state. If the female is receptive, then the male approaches her and inserts his pedipalps into an opening in the lower surface of her abdomen, the opisthosoma. After the semen has been transferred to the receptive female's body, the male swiftly leaves the scene before the female recovers her appetite. Although females may show some aggression after mating, the male rarely becomes a meal. Females deposit 50 to 2,000 eggs, depending on the species, in a silken egg sac and guard it for six to eight weeks. During this time, the females stay very close to the egg sacs and become more aggressive. Within most species, the females turn the egg sac often, which is called brooding. This keeps the eggs from deforming due to sitting in one position too long. The young spiderlings remain in the nest for some time after hatching, where they live off the remains of their yolk sacs before dispersing.  Taxonomy  Linnaeus placed all spiders in a single genus, Aranea. In 1802, Charles Athanase Walckenaer separated mygalomorph spiders into a separate genus, Mygale, leaving all other spiders in Aranea. However, Mygale had already been used in 1800 by Georges Cuvier for a genus of mammals (in Greek, mygale means \\"shrew\\"). Accordingly, in 1869, Tamerlan Thorell used the family name \\"Theraphosoidae\\" (modern Theraphosidae) for the mygalomorph spiders known to him, rather than \\"Mygalidae\\" (as used, for example, by John Blackwall). Thorell later split the family into a number of genera, including Theraphosa. = Subfamilies = These subfamilies are recognised: *Acanthopelminae ‚Äì not accepted in some schemes as synonymous with Ischnocolinae *Aviculariinae *Eumenophorinae *Harpactirinae *Ischnocolinae *Ornithoctoninae *Poecilotheriinae ‚Äì monotypic: genus Poecilotheria *Psalmopoeinae *Schismatothelinae *Selenocosmiinae *Selenogyrinae *Spelopelminae ‚Äì typically not accepted, Hemirrhagus being treated as Theraphosinae *Stromatopelminae *Theraphosinae *Thrigmopoeinae = Genera = , the World Spider Catalog accepted the following genera: *Acanthopelma F.

The park contains memorials to victims of the February 28 Incident of 1947, including the 228 Memorial Monument that stands at the center of the park and the Taipei 228 Memorial Museum, housed at the site of a former radio station that operated under Japanese and Kuomintang rule. The National Taiwan Museum stands at the park's north entrance. The park also has a bandshell and exercise areas. History The park was originally established in 1900 as Taihoku New Park(Ëá∫ÂåóÊñ∞ÂÖ¨Âúí) during the Japanese colonial period, on former temple grounds. It was the first European-style urban park in Taiwan, placed on the grounds of the Governor-General's Office. In 1930, Taiwan's Japanese authorities established a radio station at the site designed by Kuriyama Shunichi (Ê†óÂ±±‰øä‰∏Ä). The station initially housed the Taihoku Broadcasting Bureau, an arm of the Government-General Propaganda Bureau's Information Office. The following year, the Taiwan Broadcast Association was formed to handle island- wide broadcasts. The Taihoku Park radio station became the center of broadcast activity for the Association. In 1935, it was one of the sites used for The Taiwan Exposition: In Commemoration of the First Forty Years of Colonial Rule. After the handover of Taiwan from Japan to the Republic of China in 1945, the park was subsequently renamed Taipei New Park by the government. They renamed the broadcasting agency the Taiwan Broadcasting Company. The station became the primary broadcast organ of the Kuomintang government and military. In 1947, a group of protesters, angry over a brutal police action against Taiwanese civilians, took over the station and used it to broadcast accusations against the Kuomintang government. The action formed part of a chain of events now referred to as the February 28 Incident. A subsequent, more severe crackdown by the Nationalist government restored the station to Kuomintang control and ushered in Taiwan's period of white terror. Two years later, the Kuomintang lost ground in the Chinese Civil War and its leaders retreated to Taiwan. Trying to establish themselves as China's true national government in exile, they renamed the bureau the Broadcasting Corporation of China (BCC). The Taipei City government took over operation of the radio station building when the BCC moved in 1972. City officials made it the site of the Taipei City Government Parks and Street Lights Office. As Taiwan entered its modern democracy period in the 1990s, President Lee Teng-hui offered an official apology in 1995 and invited free discussion of Taiwan's past. For the first time the February 28 Incident of 1947 was officially acknowledged and its significance openly debated. In 1996, the Taipei City Government designated the former radio station building a historical site. Two years later, the building was made the home of the Taipei 228 Memorial Museum and the park was rededicated as 228 Peace Memorial Park. The 228 Memorial Monument was designed by Taiwanese architect Cheng Tzu-tsai, who was convicted of attempted murder in 1971 following a 1970 assassination attempt on Chiang Ching-kuo. After serving his sentence, he was imprisoned for illegal entry to Taiwan in 1991 and filed his design entry from prison. The Monument is inscribed with an exhortation for peace and unity. On 25 November 2019, the museum was declared as a cultural asset by the Bureau of Cultural Heritage.

McNaught was cast in the role to help boost falling ratings in Australia. The character made her first screen appearance on 2 May 2008. Sienna was introduced as the cousin of the established Carmella Cammeniti (Natalie Blair). In July 2008, McNaught took the decision to cut her contract short and Sienna departed on 3 October 2008. During her time on Neighbours, McNaught's casting and acting were negatively received by critics, acting agencies and viewers. Creation and casting In November 2007, it was announced that model and former Australian Miss Universe representative, Erin McNaught would be joining the cast of Neighbours to help boost falling ratings in Australia. Producers also recruited fellow model Imogen Bailey (Nicola West) and former Australian Idol contestant Dean Geyer (Ty Harper) in a bid to \\"sex up\\" the cast. McNaught took acting classes in preparation for the role of Sienna and she began filming her first scenes on 17 December. On joining the show, McNaught said \\"Everyone has grown up watching Neighbours, of course I am nervous. It is a big change from what I have been used to doing\\". In March 2008, McNaught's contract was extended by three months after she impressed the Neighbours bosses. However, she was still described as a guest cast member and was not expected to be signed beyond the deal. In July 2008, it was announced that McNaught had opted to relinquish her role as Sienna, for the benefit of her relationship with Braith Anasta and because she was homesick. On her departure McNaught said \\"It was a great experience and I'm really happy with what I have been achieving in acting ‚Äì so it was a tough decision to make. Development McNaught spoke to TV Week about Sienna and her past with her cousin Carmella (Natalie Blair), saying \\"There was a bit of rivalry between Sienna and Carmella when they were growing up, so it'll be interesting to see what happens now. Sienna's been working in the country and has come to the city to try her hand at something new and discover more about who she is.\\" When asked if there was any romance coming up for her character, she said \\"I'm not sure. She might even set her sights on someone who's already taken! That could be well be in her nature.\\" Network Ten describe Sienna as being \\"one of a seemingly endless array of Cammeniti cousins\\", she is attractive and passionate, but can occasionally be misguided. Sienna and Carmella did not get on when they were younger and they often fought each other for their family's attentions. Ten said they tried to be \\"more beautiful and charming than the other. While they're both old enough to know better now, it remains to be seen whether Carmella and Sienna can leave their competitiveness behind.\\" Storylines Sienna leaves her job as a nurse in the countryside and moves to Erinsborough due to problems at home. She goes to Harold's Store to see her cousin Carmella, but discovers that she is in Italy. Sienna meets Carmella's partner Marco Silvani (Jesse Rosenfeld) and Lou Carpenter (Tom Oliver). Lou becomes besotted with Sienna and he offers her a job at the store after she bakes him some muffins. When Carmella returns she is shocked to find Sienna working at the Store. Sienna explains that it is time they got to know each other properly, as they did not get along when they were younger. Sienna makes friends with the locals. Carmella steals money from the store's till and Sienna is wrongly accused and fired. Carmella later owns up and Sienna is rehired. Sienna helps Carmella admit that she has a shopping addition. She also moves in with Carmella and Marco. Carmella throws a party in the bush for Marco's birthday and he proposes to Carmella. A bush fire breaks out, causing the group to scatter. Sienna is not hurt, but Marco is seriously injured. After he is told that he does not have long to live, Marco and Carmella marry, with Sienna acting as bridesmaid. Ty Harper's (Dean Geyer) band hold auditions for a female lead singer and Sienna is tempted to audition. As Ty wants Rachel Kinski (Caitlin Stasey) to be the lead singer, he organises a group of bad singers to audition first, in the hope that his bandmates will pick Rachel. Ty overhears Sienna singing along to some music and picks her to audition. Sienna sings reasonably well and Ty's bandmate, Logan Ellis (Nick Cain), falls for her and she is hired. Sienna struggles with some of the band's songs and Carmella asks Rachel to help her. Rachel admits that she also struggles with the songs and helps Sienna to improve her sound. At her first performance, Sienna becomes nervous and asks Rachel to sing with her. Ty tries to persuade his bandmates that Rachel is better and he gets Zeke Kinski (Matthew Werkmeister) to turn Rachel's volume up on the sound system. The performance goes well, but when Logan tries to kiss Sienna, she quits the band, believing that she was hired for her looks. Sienna's cousin, Rosetta (Natalie Saleeba) has a baby and sends Carmella tickets to fly out to Italy for a visit. But Carmella is too busy with the store and Sienna uses the tickets instead. Lou tries to get Sienna and Logan to reconcile, so Sienna will stay in Australia. But after Sienna and Logan make up, she announces that Logan is coming with her. Sienna promises Lou that she will return one day. Reception During her time with Neighbours, McNaught's acting skills came in for criticism and the decision to add McNaught, Bailey and Geyer to the cast outraged the acting industry. Agents accused the show of \\"sacrificing quality in favour of ratings\\". Chief of Brisbane acting agency Ego Management, Mark Eaton said that the shows producers were \\"simply hunting for eye-candy when they hired Erin and fellow lad mags' favourite Imogen Bailey\\". He added \\"This is all done to try to get viewing figures up the producers are not worried about the quality of the show at all\\". Viewers said that McNaught's acting made them \\"cringe\\". Fiona Byrne of the Herald Sun said \\"Despite enormous press interest surrounding her joining the show, McNaught's character has made little impact on the series and she seemed to be counting down the days until her contract with the show finished\\".

As the plum tree can usually grow for a long time, ancient trees are found throughout China. Huangmei county (Yellow Mei) in Hubei features a 1,600-year-old plum tree from the Jin Dynasty which is still flowering. The three stamens represents Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People, while the five petals symbolize the five branches of the government: Executive Yuan, Legislative Yuan, Judicial Yuan, Examination Yuan and Control Yuan.National Flag, Anthem and Flower The flower has also been proposed to be one of the national flowers for the People's Republic of China.*People's Daily Online -- Plum blossom, peony proposed to be national flowers History The mudan (Paeonia suffruticosa) was referred to as the \\"national flower\\" of China during the Ming and Qing era. It was still recognised by many to be the national flower during the Beiyang government era, amidst calls to designate other flowers such as the Chrysanthemum to be the national symbol. The Ceremony and Uniform Review Committee of the Ministry of the Interior (MOI), Nationalist Government in 1928 proposed that the plum blossom be the National Flower; the Ministry of Education (MOE) reviewed the proposal and assented to it. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) had also requested the Central Executive Committee (CEC) of the Kuomintang (Nationalist Party) to designate the National Flower for the making of new currency. On 28 January 1929, the CEC adopted a resolution to use the plum blossom for various emblems of the state, but regarding the designation of the National Flower, they decided to list it as one of the agendas of the party's 3rd National Congress. The Nationalist Government issued a general order on 8 February 1929, adopting the plum blossom in various state emblem designs. Despite the designation not being approved during the 3rd National Congress, the plum blossom has been widely accepted by society as the symbol of the nation. In 1964, the MOI advised the Executive Yuan to stipulate it as the National Flower; the latter, in a reply on 21 July 1964, stated that the plum blossom as the national flower \\"has long been recognised nationwide\\", and that there was \\"no need to make an announcement or a press release\\". The plum blossom was thus recognised by the Executive Yuan as the National Flower of the Republic of China (the country's effective jurisdiction was reduced to Taiwan after the Chinese Civil War) as an established fact. Symbolism As the National Flower, the plum blossom symbolises: *Three buds and five petals - symbolises Three Principles of the People and the five branches of the Government in accordance with the Constitution *The plum blossom withstands the cold winter (it blossoms more in colder temperatures) - it symbolises the faithful, the resolute and the holy; it represents the national spirit of Republic of China nationals. *The five petals of the flower - symbolises Five Races Under One Union; it also symbolises Five Cardinal Relationships (W«îl√∫n), Five Constants (W«îch√°ng) and Five Ethics (W«îji√†o) according to Confucian philosophy (national philosophy of imperial China for two millennia until 1912, when the Qing Dynasty was overthrown and the Republic of China was established) *The branches (ÊûùÊ©´), shadow (ÂΩ±Êñú), flexibility (Êõ≥Áñè), and cold resistance (ÂÇ≤Èúú) of the plum blossom also represent the four kinds of noble virtues, \\"originating and penetrating, advantageous and firm\\" mentioned in the I Ching (Book of Changes).  Use of the symbol  As one of the national symbols of Taiwan (officially the Republic of China), the plum blossom design has often been utilised on logos used by the Taiwanese government. This includes the emblem of the Office of the President and the Chinese Taipei Olympic flag (also known as \\"Plum Blossom Banner\\"), which Taiwan uses in place of the flag of the Republic of China during international sports events, due to political reasons.

He lectured extensively in the areas of historical theology, ecumenism, and spirituality.  Early life  George Tavard was born on February 6, 1922, in Nancy, France. He entered a religious community known as the Augustinians of the Assumption and was ordained in 1947. At that point, Tavard began doctoral studies at the Faculties theologiques de Lyon. He held the Doctor of Sacred Theology from Lyons, and he taught theology at Capenor House in Surrey, England from 1949‚Äì1951 and the Princeton Theological Seminary from 1951-1952. He then came to the United States as a permanent resident in 1952,\\"Father George Tavard, A.A. dies suddenly in Paris\\", Assumptionists, North American Province and became a naturalized citizen in 1960.  Career  Tavard accepted a teaching position at Mount Mercy College in Pittsburgh, where he would teach for six years. During his tenure at Mount Mercy College, Pope John XXIII named Tavard a peritus conciliaris at Vatican II, where he also served as a consultant to the Secretariat for the Promotion of Christian Unity. After departing Mount Mercy College, Tavard taught at Assumption College, Penn State University and Methodist Theological School in Ohio in Delaware, Ohio, where he retired in 1990. Father Tavard was a member of the Anglican-Roman Catholic Joint Preparatory Commission (\\"Malta Report\\", 1968), and then of the Anglican-Roman Catholic International Commission (ARCIC-1: \\"Final Report,\\" 1983) until 1983, when he was assigned to the International dialogue of the RC Church and the World Methodist Council. He was part of ARC-USA (Anglican-Roman Catholic Conversations in the USA) and of Lutheran-Roman Catholic Dialogue in the USA from the beginning. He has lectured and written extensively in the areas of historical theology, ecumenism, and spirituality. He was an official Catholic observer at the World Council of Churches's Conference on Faith and Order in Montreal, 1963, at the General Convention of the Episcopal Church in Denver, CO, 1980, and the delegate of the Catholic Church at the meeting of the Anglican Consultative Council in Panama, 1997.  Controversial positions = Ecumenism = Tavard was best known for his emphatic support of ecumenism, focusing on bridging the gaps between Roman Catholicism and Protestant sects of Christianity as well as between Christianity and Judaism. He voted for the Decree on Ecumenism of the Second Vatican Council, which constituted a starting point for bi-lateral dialogues between churches. While he recognized that the Papacy and many churches would be reluctant to fully embrace one another, he stressed the importance of education for church officials in pressing for rapprochement with Christians of all denominations. While he conceded that consolidation under one church was not feasible, he still implored theologians and lay Christians alike to discuss their views, seek as much common ground as they could find and leave it to God from there. He detested the manner in which the Catholic Church treated other sects and their leaders. For example, he beseeched the Catholic brass to cease with the hundreds of years of condemnations of Martin Luther and to accord him a place of honor instead. Father Tavard made a significant contribution to Symposia of The Villanova Theology Institute founded by Professor Joseph Papin through his presentation: \\"Ecumenical Dimensions: A New Hope and Vision of unity\\" in The Pilgrim People: A Vision With Hope, ed. Joseph Papin, The Villanova University Press, 1970, pp. 143‚Äì168. He also addressed the important topic of a reconstruction of the ministry: \\"Can the Ministry be Re-Constructed?\\" in Transcendence and Immanence, Reconstruction in the Light of Process Thinking, Festschrift in Honour of Joseph Papin, ed. Joseph Armenti, Volume I, The Abbey Press, 1972, pp. 83‚Äì98. (Some issue arose concerning the editing of Tavard's article, but a comparison of the manuscript submitted and the printed text shows that they were identical). Again, in looking to further the unity of Christians and a \\"'wider ecumenism' embracing all great religions\\", Fr. Tavard authored an article which sought a \\"positive response\\" to this widing of the ecumenical ideal: \\"Two Sources for Christology,\\" in The Papin Gedenkschrift: Dimensions in the Human Religious Quest, Essays in Memory of Joseph Papin, Volume I: Theological Dimensions, ed. Joseph Armenti (Michigan, 1987), pp. 38‚Äì53. = Women's role in the church = Tavard raised the issue of women's roles within the Catholic Church in his 1973 book, Women in Christian Tradition, one of the first major theologians to do so. While he remained a part of the minority for his view that women needed a bigger role in the Catholic Church, he insisted that the ordination of women was not only fair but also necessary to the survival of the church. Tavard predicted that within fifty years of the book's publication, women would be able to be ordained and priests would be allowed to marry. True to his ecumenist beliefs, Tavard cited the models of Protestant churches when prescribing a remedy for the waning numbers of Catholic vocations. While he acknowledged that a referendum allowing women to be ordained would fail in a referendum amongst American Catholics, he pointed out that it would succeed amongst French Catholics and thus was an unavoidable aspect of future Catholicism. = Vietnam War = Tavard opposed American policy in Vietnam, questioning the moral compass of those who supported American involvement there. He asserted that it was a civil war and that only the well-being of the people in that country should guide American policy with regard to Vietnam. He argued that the fact that one side was Communist did not matter and that the American government was using the \\"Communist\\" tag to exploit the fears associated with that term amongst the American public in order to wage a war he deemed immoral and unjust.

It is a form of language processing. Success in this process is measured as reading comprehension. Reading is a means for language acquisition, communication, and sharing information and ideas. The symbols are typically visual (written or printed) but may be tactile (Braille). Like all languages, it is a complex interaction between text and reader, shaped by prior knowledge, experiences, attitude, and the language community‚Äîwhich is culturally and socially situated. Readers use a variety of reading strategies to decode (to translate symbols into sounds or visual representations of speech) and comprehend. Readers may use context clues to identify the meaning of unknown words. Readers integrate the words they have read into their existing framework of knowledge or schema. Other types of reading are not speech based writing systems, such as music notation or pictograms. The common link is the interpretation of symbols to extract the meaning from the visual notations or tactile signals (as in the case of Braille). Overview Volunteer reads to a girl at the Casa Hogar de las Ni√±as in Mexico City Currently most reading is either of the printed word from ink or toner on paper, such as in a book, magazine, newspaper, leaflet, or notebook, or of electronic displays, such as computer displays, television, mobile phones or e-readers. Handwritten text may also be produced using a graphite pencil or a pen. Short texts may be written or painted on an object. Often the text relates to the object, such as an address on an envelope, product info on packaging, or text on a traffic or street sign. A slogan may be painted on a wall. A text may also be produced by arranging stones of a different color in a wall or road. Short texts like these are sometimes referred to as environmental print. Sometimes text or images are in relief, with or without using a color contrast. Words or images can be carved in stone, wood, or metal; instructions can be printed in relief on the plastic housing of a home appliance, or myriad other examples. A requirement for reading is a good contrast between letters and background (depending on colors of letters and background, any pattern or image in the background, and lighting) and a suitable font size. In the case of a computer screen, it is important to see an entire line of text without scrolling. The field of visual word recognition studies how people read individual words. A key technique in studying how individuals read text is eye tracking. This has revealed that reading is performed as a series of eye fixations with saccades between them. Humans also do not appear to fixate on every word in a text, but instead pause on some words mentally while their eyes are moving. This is possible because human languages show certain linguistic regularities. The process of recording information to read later is writing. In the case of computer and microfiche storage there is the separate step of displaying the written text. For humans, reading is usually faster and easier than writing. Reading is typically an individual activity, though on occasion a person reads out loud for other listeners. Reading aloud for one's own use, for better comprehension, is a form of intrapersonal communication: in the early 1970s has been proposed the dual-route hypothesis to reading aloud, accordingly to which there were two separate mental mechanisms, or cognitive routes, that are involved in this case, with output of both mechanisms contributing to the pronunciation of a written stimulus. Reading to young children is recommended by educators and researchers. It helps to stimulate imagination, increase knowledge of the world, and encourage a love of reading; and it builds skills in language, expression, vocabulary, comprehension of text, and spoken language sounds (phonemic awareness). It also is a good introduction to guided reading which can be done at home as well as at school. Before the reintroduction of separated text in the late Middle Ages, the ability to read silently was considered rather remarkable. Purposes Reading may be used for at school or work, incidentally during everyday life activities (such as reading the instructions in a cooking recipe), or for pleasure. In the context of school or work, reading is a means of learning necessary information. As a leisure activity, children and adults read because it is pleasant and interesting. In the US, about half of all adults read one or more books for pleasure each year. About 5% read more than 50 books per year. Americans read more if they have more education, if they read fluently and easily, if they are female, if they live in cities, and if they have higher socioeconomic status. Children become better readers when they know more about the world in general, and when they perceive reading as fun, rather than another chore to be performed. Percentage of students who reach minimum proficiency level in reading, current level and projections to 2030 by scenarios Reading skills Literacy is the ability to use the symbols of a writing system. It is the ability to interpret what the information symbols represent, and re-create those same symbols so that others can derive the same meaning. Illiteracy is the inability to derive meaning from the symbols used in a writing system. Dyslexia refers to a cognitive difficulty with reading and writing. It is defined as brain-based type of learning disability that specifically impairs a person's ability to read. The term dyslexia can refer to two disorders: developmental dyslexia which is a learning disability. Alexia (acquired dyslexia) refers to reading difficulties that occur following brain damage, stroke, or progressive illness. * Major predictors of an individual's ability to read both alphabetic and nonalphabetic scripts are phonological awareness, rapid automatized naming and verbal IQ. Being taught to read at an early age (such as five years old) does not ultimately result in better reading skills, and if it replaces more developmentally appropriate activities, then it may cause other harms. =Reading rate= Average reading rate in words per minute (wpm) depending on age and measured with different tests in English, French and German Many studies show that increasing reading speed improves comprehension. Reading speed requires a long time to reach adult levels. The table to the right shows how reading-rate varies with age,Im Auge des Lesers, foveale und periphere Wahrnehmung: vom Buchstabieren zur Lesefreude(2006), ppgs. 117. regardless of the period (1965 to 2005) and the language (English, French, German). The Taylor values probably are higher, for disregarding students who failed the comprehension test. The reading test by the French psychologist Pierre Lefavrais (\\"L'alouette\\", published in 1967) tested reading aloud, with a penalty for errors, and could, therefore, not be a rate greater than 150 wpm. According to Carver (1990), children's reading speed increases throughout the school years. On average, from grade 2 to college, reading rate increases 14 standard-length words per minute each year (where one standard-length word is defined as six characters in text, including punctuation and spaces). Note that the data from Taylor (English) and Landerl (German) are based on texts of increasing difficulty; other data were obtained when all age groups were reading the same text. Rates of reading include reading for memorization (fewer than 100 words per minute [wpm]); reading for learning (100‚Äì200 wpm); reading for comprehension (200‚Äì400 wpm); and skimming (400‚Äì700 wpm). Reading for comprehension is the essence of the daily reading of most people. Skimming is for superficially processing large quantities of text at a low level of comprehension (below 50%). Advice for choosing the appropriate reading-rate includes reading flexibly, slowing when concepts are closely presented and when the material is new, and increasing when the material is familiar and of thin concept. Speed reading courses and books often encourage the reader to continually accelerate; comprehension tests lead the reader to believe his or her comprehension is continually improving; yet, competence-in-reading requires knowing that skimming is dangerous, as a default habit. Scientific studies have demonstrated that reading‚Äîdefined here as capturing and decoding all the words on every page‚Äîfaster than 900 wpm is not feasible given the limits set by the anatomy of the eye. Reading speed has been used as a measure in research to determine the effect of interventions on human vision. A Cochrane Systematic Review used reading speed in words per minute as the primary outcome in comparing different reading aids for adults with low vision. =Skill development= Addy Vannasy reads aloud to children at a village \\"Discovery Day\\" in Laos. Reading aloud is a common technique for improving literacy rates. Big Brother Mouse, which organized the event, trains its staff in read-aloud techniques such as making eye contact with the audience, modulating one's voice, and pausing occasionally for dramatic effect. Both lexical and sub-lexical cognitive processes contribute to how we learn to read. Sub-lexical reading, involves teaching reading by associating characters or groups of characters with sounds or by using phonics or synthetic phonics learning and teaching methodology, which some argue is in competition with whole language methods. Lexical reading involves acquiring words or phrases without attention to the characters or groups of characters that compose them or by using whole language learning and teaching methodology. Some argue that this competes with phonics and synthetic phonics methods, and that the whole language approach tends to impair learning to spell. Other methods of teaching and learning to read have developed, and become somewhat controversial. Learning to read in a second language, especially in adulthood, may be a different process than learning to read a native language in childhood. There are cases of very young children learning to read without having been taught. Such was the case with Truman Capote who reportedly taught himself to read and write at the age of five. There are also accounts of people who taught themselves to read by comparing street signs or Biblical passages to speech. The novelist Nicholas Delbanco taught himself to read at age six during a transatlantic crossing by studying a book about boats. Brain activity in young and older children can be used to predict future reading skill. Cross model mapping between the orthographic and phonologic areas in the brain are critical in reading. Thus, the amount of activation in the left dorsal inferior frontal gyrus while performing reading tasks can be used to predict later reading ability and advancement. Young children with higher phonological word characteristic processing have significantly better reading skills later on than older children who focus on whole-word orthographic representation. =Methods of reading= Reading is an intensive process in which the eye quickly moves to assimilate text‚Äîseeing just accurately enough to interpret groups of symbols. It is necessary to understand visual perception and eye movement to understand the reading process. There are several types and methods of reading, with differing rates that can be attained for each, for different kinds of material and purposes: * Subvocalized reading combines sight reading with internal sounding of the words as if spoken. Advocates of speed reading claim it can be a bad habit that slows reading and comprehension, but other studies indicate the reverse, particularly with difficult texts. * Speed reading is a collection of methods for increasing reading speed without an unacceptable reduction in comprehension or retention. Methods include skimming or the chunking of words in a body of text to increase the rate of reading. It is closely connected to speed learning. * Incremental reading is a software-assisted reading method designed for long-term memorization. \\"Incremental reading\\" means \\"reading in portions\\": in each session, parts of several electronic articles are read inside a prioritized reading list. In the course of reading, important pieces of information are extracted and converted into flashcards, which are then reviewed by a spaced repetition algorithm. * Proofreading is a kind of reading for the purpose of detecting typographical errors. One can learn to do it rapidly, and professional proofreaders typically acquire the ability to do so at high rates, faster for some kinds of material than for others, while they may largely suspend comprehension while doing so, except when needed to select among several possible words that a suspected typographic error allows. A good proofreader needs to have a strong vocabulary and should be meticulous in their approach. * Rereading is reading a book more than once. \\"One cannot read a book: one can only reread it,\\" Vladimir Nabokov once said.Patricia Meyer Spacks (2011). On Rereading, Harvard University Press. Many take notes while reading. * Structure-proposition-evaluation (SPE) method, popularized by Mortimer Adler in How to Read a Book, mainly for non-fiction treatise, in which one reads a writing in three passes: (1) for the structure of the work, which might be represented by an outline; (2) for the logical propositions made, organized into chains of inference; and (3) for evaluation of the merits of the arguments and conclusions. This method involves suspended judgment of the work or its arguments until they are fully understood. * Survey-question- read-recite-review (SQ3R) method, often taught in public schools, which involves reading toward being able to teach what is read, and is appropriate for instructors preparing to teach material without referring to notes. * Multiple intelligences-based methods, which draw on the reader's diverse ways of thinking and knowing to enrich appreciation of the text. Reading is fundamentally a linguistic activity: one can basically comprehend a text without resorting to other intelligences, such as the visual (e.g., mentally \\"seeing\\" characters or events described), auditory (e.g., reading aloud or mentally \\"hearing\\" sounds described), or even the logical intelligence (e.g., considering \\"what if\\" scenarios or predicting how the text will unfold based on context clues). However, most readers already use several kinds of intelligence while reading. Doing so in a more disciplined manner‚Äîi.e., constantly, or after every paragraph‚Äîcan result in a more vivid, memorable experience. * Rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) reading involves presenting the words in a sentence one word at a time at the same location on the display screen, at a specified eccentricity. RSVP eliminates inter-word saccades, limits intra-word saccades, and prevents reader control of fixation times (Legge, Mansfield, & Chung, 2001). RSVP controls for differences in reader eye movement, and consequently is often used to measure reading speed in experiments. Reading process is therefore a communication context. Assessment Different types of reading tests exist: * Sight word reading: reading words of increasing difficulty until they become unable to read or understand the words presented to them. Difficulty is manipulated by using words that have more letters or syllables, are less common and have more complicated spelling‚Äìsound relationships. * Nonword reading: reading lists of pronounceable nonsense words out loud. The difficulty is increased by using longer words, and also by using words with more complex spelling or sound sequences. * Reading comprehension: a passage is presented to the reader, which they must read either silently or out loud. Then a series of questions are presented that test the reader's comprehension of this passage. * Reading fluency: the rate with which individuals can name words. * Reading accuracy: the ability to correctly name a word on a page. Some tests incorporate several of the above components at once. For instance, the Nelson-Denny Reading Test scores readers both on the speed with which they can read a passage, and also their ability to accurately answer questions about this passage. Recent research has questioned the validity of the Nelson-Denny Reading Test, especially with regard to the identification of reading disabilities. Cognitive benefits Reading books and writing are among brain-stimulating activities shown to slow down cognitive decline in old age, with people who participated in more mentally stimulating activities over their lifetimes having a slower rate of decline in memory and other mental capacities. which cites Reading for pleasure has been linked to increased cognitive progress in vocabulary and mathematics during adolescence. Reading also reduces stress, improves memory, focus, writing skills, and enhances imagination. Sustained high volume lifetime reading has been associated with high levels of academic attainment. Moreover, the cognitive benefits of reading continue into mid-life and old age. Effects Night reading has benefits to calm the nerves by eliminating excess sound and vision stimulus resulting in better sleep. =Lighting= Reading from paper and from some screens requires more lighting than many other activities. Therefore, the possibility of doing this comfortably in caf√©s, restaurants, buses, at bus stops or in parks greatly varies depending on available lighting and time of day. Reading from screens that produce their own light does not depend on external light, except that external light may lessen visual fatigue. For controlling what is on the screen (scrolling, turning the page, etc.), a touch screen or keyboard illumination further reduces dependency on external light. History Men reading The history of reading dates back to the invention of writing during the 4th millennium BC. Although reading print text is now an important way for the general population to access information, this has not always been the case. With some exceptions, only a small percentage of the population in many countries was considered literate before the Industrial Revolution. Some of the pre-modern societies with generally high literacy rates included classical Athens and the Islamic Caliphate. Scholars assume that reading aloud (Latin clare legere) was the more common practice in antiquity, and that reading silently (legere tacite or legere sibi) was unusual.Carruthers, Mary. 2008. The Book of Memory: A Study of Memory in Medieval Culture. 2nd. ed. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 212 ff.. In his Confessions, Saint Augustine remarks on Saint Ambrose's unusual habit of reading silently in the 4th century AD.Jajdelska, Elspeth. 2007. Silent Reading and the Birth of the Narrator. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, p. 5. During the Age of Enlightenment, elite individuals promoted passive reading, rather than creative interpretation. Reading has no concrete laws, but lets readers escape to produce their own products introspectively, promoting deep exploration of texts during interpretation. Some thinkers of that era believed that construction, or the creation of writing and producing a product, was a sign of initiative and active participation in society‚Äîand viewed consumption (reading) as simply taking in what constructors made.De Certeau, Michel. \\"Reading as Poaching.\\" The Practice of Everyday Life. Trans. Steven F. Rendall. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984. 165-176. Also during this era, writing was considered superior to reading in society. They considered readers of that time passive citizens, because they did not produce a product. Michel de Certeau argued that the elites of the Age of Enlightenment were responsible for this general belief. Michel de Certeau believed that reading required venturing into an author's land, but taking away what the reader wanted specifically. This view held that writing was a superior art to reading within the hierarchical constraints of the era. In 18th-century Europe, the then new practice of reading alone in bed was, for a time, considered dangerous and immoral. As reading became less a communal, oral practice, and more a private, silent one‚Äîand as sleeping increasingly moved from communal sleeping areas to individual bedrooms, some raised concern that reading in bed presented various dangers, such as fires caused by bedside candles. Some modern critics, however, speculate that these concerns were based on the fear that readers‚Äîespecially women‚Äîcould escape familial and communal obligations and transgress moral boundaries through the private fantasy worlds in books.

It belongs to the subfamily Cetoniinae, comprising a group of beetles commonly called flower chafers since many of them feed on pollen, nectar, or petals. Its habitat is primarily the southwestern United States and Mexico. Figeater beetles are often mistaken for green June beetles (Cotinis nitida) and occasionally Japanese beetles (Popillia japonica), which occur in the eastern US. Figeater beetle larvae, commonly called \\"crawly backs\\", roll on their backs and propel themselves upsidedown. Adult figeater beetles grow to approximately . They are a semi-glossy green on the top and a brilliant iridescent green on the underside and legs. They are active during daylight hours, often congregating in the shade of trees near choice breeding grounds to find mates. The figeater beetle is native to moister areas of the American southwest, where its natural diet includes fruit from cacti and sap from desert trees. Their range has expanded considerably since the 1960s with the increasing availability of home gardens, compost piles, and organic mulch. The larvae eat decomposing organic matter, such as that found in compost piles, manure piles, and organic mulch, and occasionally plant roots, such as the roots of grass in lawns. The adult's primary food has become fruit in gardens and orchards.  Life cycle  Various larval stages; one shows typical \\"C\\"-shaped position; another stretches out upside down to move‚Äîlegs are visible at upper end. After mating, eggs are laid in decaying matter or compost piles, which provide sustenance for the emerging larvae. Figeater beetle larvae, commonly called \\"crawly backs\\", grow up to and are thick and white with a dark head. They have six small, ineffectual legs; to move, they roll onto their backs and propel themselves upside down, using the stiff dark hairs on their backs to gain traction. At rest, they curl into a firm C shape. Pupation occurs in the spring; adults emerge from July to September (varies with location). Adult figeater beetles grow to approximately . They are active during daylight hours, often congregating in the shade of trees near choice breeding grounds to find mates. They make a loud buzzing sound similar to that of carpenter bees, possibly because they do not need to open their elytra in order to fly, an ability shared with many other flower beetles.  Taxonomy  C. mutabilis is often confused with the green June beetle (Cotinis nitida). Both are members of the flower beetle subfamily (Cetoniinae), and are similar in appearance, but the green June beetle is smaller, and its range is in the eastern United States. The only possible crossover of both species is in Texas. They are also occasionally mistaken for Japanese beetles (Popillia japonica), which occur in the eastern US.  Diet  The figeater beetle is native to moister areas of the American southwest, where its natural diet includes fruit from cacti and sap from desert trees. Their range has expanded considerably since the 1960s with the increasing availability of home gardens, compost piles, and organic mulch. The larvae eat decomposing organic matter, such as that found in compost piles, manure piles, and organic mulch, and occasionally plant roots, such as the roots of grass in lawns. The adult's primary food has become fruit in gardens and orchards. They prefer sweet food, which includes the leaves, flowers, and saps of some plants and ripe or overripe fruit. Fruit with tough skins are too hard for them to bite through, so they most often eat softer-skinned fruit such as figs, peaches, grapes, pears, and tomatoes, among others. The beetles are particularly attracted to ripening and fermenting fruit, which emit gases that lead the beetles to them, and to fruit that other animals or insects have already damaged. In most small gardens, the adult beetles are minor pests that do little damage; however, they can swarm on soft or damaged fruit and have been known to eat an entire garden grape or fig crop. They are not considered to be an important pest because they do not damage lawns as larvae and trees as much as June beetles or Japanese beetles.

In 19th-century Britain, it developed as a political movement in opposition to disestablishmentarianism, the Liberal Party's efforts to disestablish or remove the Church of England as the official state church of England, Ireland, and Wales. The Church's status has been maintained in England, but in Ireland, the Anglican Church of Ireland was disestablished in 1871. In Wales, four Church of England dioceses were disestablished in 1920 and became the Church in Wales. The position of antidisestablishmentarianism has been favoured by Christian nationalists. Antidisestablishmentarianism is also frequently noted as one of the longest non-scientific words in the English language. However, the word is not recorded in Merriam Webster's dictionary. History The matter of disestablishment of the Church of England is an ongoing issue, often tied with the position of the Monarchy of the United Kingdom as \\"Supreme Governor\\" of the Church (see Act of Settlement 1701). British philosopher Phillip Blond, an advocate of the antidisestablishmentarian position, argues that England having a state church has prevented the country from embracing any sort of ethnic or racial nationalism. Blond has stated that official patronage of the Church of England has allowed the country to withstand and speak against totalitarian ideologies of the 20th century that were plaguing other parts of the world. He further opined that \\"Just as we need the church to protect the political, so we need it to protect the idea of civil society.\\" Blond concludes that the \\"church establishment in England creates a more diverse political and social life, prevents religious extremism and helps to minimise partisan conflict and secular violence.\\" Giles Coren, a British writer, supports antidisestablishmentarianism because it allows all English people to receive meaningful rites such as marriage. In April 2014, Nick Clegg, then Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and Leader of the Liberal Democrats, said that he thought the Church of England and the British state should be separated \\"in the long run\\". David Cameron, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom at the time, responded to Clegg's comments by stating that the position was \\"a long-term Liberal idea, but it is not a Conservative one\\", adding that he believed the existence of an established church is beneficial. Word length The word antidisestablishmentarianism is notable for its unusual length of 28 letters and 12 syllables (an-ti-dis-es-tab-lish-ment-ar- i-an-is-m), and is one of the longest words in the English language.What is the longest English word?

Yad L'Achim is made up of both paid staff and volunteers, and is largely supported by donations both from Israel and the Diaspora.Yad L'Achim's About our Staff page  History  Yad L'Achim was formed in 1950 with the stated goal of \\"helping new immigrants to the newly-born country to find a suitable religious framework\\". Over time, the founders were disturbed by emerging missionary efforts in the new State, and then later by assimilation. It then shifted a major part of its activities to combatting these two issues.\\"From the Yad L'Achim website, background page. Yad L'Achim has other departments as well, including one devoted to the spiritual absorption of immigrants from the Commonwealth of Independent States, and one that helps enroll children in religious schools.  Beliefs  Yad L'Achim adheres to Haredi Judaism.  Counter-Missionary activity  Yad L'Achim's main focus is counter-missionary opposition to efforts to convert Jews to Christianity. Yad L'Achim claims that over 100 missionary congregations and cults are currently active in Israel. The Israel government cooperates to some degree with Yad L'Achim in discouraging proselytizing, which is technically legal unless a minor is targeted without parental consent. Yad L'Achim has also demanded that Pope Benedict XVI act to reveal the \\"hidden Jewish children\\" of the Holocaust.Call for Pope to Reveal Hidden Holocaust Children  Opposition to Arab-Jewish marriages  Yad L'Achim aims to rescue Jewish women and children in abusive relationships with Arabs. They respond to requests from the women themselves, or concerned family members. Since its inception, it has rescued thousands of women and children from situations of abuse. The organization also provides shelter for the women and children after rescue. Convicted murderer Yaakov Teitel has stated that he participated in 25 'rescue missions' for the group, but Yad L'Achim has strongly denied this. In 2010 Yad L'Achim helped rescue an Israeli woman and her four children from her abusive husband. Her family had contacted Yad L'Achim after she spoke to them from Gaza complaining about her husband's abusive and violent behavior. In 2019, the organization helped reunite an Israeli woman with her son who was abducted as a child by his Palestinian father 30 years prior.  Harassment of Christian missionaries in Israel  Christian missionaries in Israel have repeatedly complained of being persecuted, harassed, threatened, and attacked by Yad L'Achim and a similar group, Lev L'Achim. These complaints, as well as slow response time by the authorities, is a continued matter of concern to the U.S. State Department, as described in their Annual Report on International Religious Freedom for 1999: Israel, and repeatedly in the State Department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor's annual International Religious Freedom Report, most recently in the 2009 report.International Religious Freedom Report 2009: Israel and the occupied territories Released by the US Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor The State Department notes in its 2001 report, however, that the negativity toward proselytizing of Israeli Jews goes beyond that towards Yad L'Achim: :\\"Societal attitudes toward missionary activities and conversion generally are negative. Israeli Jews frequently are opposed to missionary activity directed at Jews and occasionally are hostile toward Jewish converts to Christianity. Such attitudes often are attributed to the frequent periods in Jewish history in which Jews were coerced to convert to Christianity.\\" Jehovah's Witnesses filed over 120 complaints about instances of harassment by Jewish groups during 1998 and 1999; yet, there have been no indictments or prosecutions. At the same time, a member of the Jehovah's Witness was arrested and charged with \\"offending religious sensitivity\\" for distributing religious literature at Tel Aviv's bus station on March 1, 1999. The complainant was a Yad L'achim member. The Jehovah's Witness claimed he was being singled out for prosecution because he had filed five complaints against Yad L'achim.

Its common name derives from the animal's silvery light grey colour, combined with the fish-like appearance of its movements. The scientific name (L. saccharinum) indicates that the silverfish's diet consists of carbohydrates such as sugar or starches.  Description  The silverfish is a nocturnal insect typically long. Its abdomen tapers at the end, giving it a fish-like appearance. The newly hatched are whitish, but develop a greyish hue and metallic shine as they get older. It has two long cerci and one terminal filament at the tip of the abdomen between the cerci. It also has two small compound eyes, despite other members of Zygentoma being completely eyeless, such as the family Nicoletiidae. Like other species in Apterygota, the silverfish is completely wingless. It has long antennae, and moves in a wiggling motion that resembles the movement of a fish. This, coupled with its appearance and silvery scales, inspires its common name. Silverfish typically live for two to eight years. The silverfish is an agile runner and can outrun most of its predators (including wandering spiders and centipedes). However, such running is possible only on horizontal surfaces, as it lacks any additional appendages, and therefore is not fast enough to climb walls at the same speed. It also avoids light.  Distribution  Silverfish are a cosmopolitan species, found in Africa, the Americas, Australia, Eurasia, and other parts of the Pacific. They inhabit moist areas, requiring a relative humidity between 75% and 95%. In urban areas, they can be found in attics, basements, bathtubs, sinks, kitchens, old books, classrooms, and showers.  Reproduction and life cycle  A silverfish Before silverfish reproduce, they carry out a ritual involving three phases, which may last over half an hour. In the first phase, the male and female stand face to face, their quivering antennae touching, then repeatedly back off and return to this position. In the second phase, the male runs away and the female chases him. In the third phase, the male and female stand side by side and head to tail, with the male vibrating his tail against the female.Sturm, Helmut (1956-01-12). Zeitschrift f√ºr Tierpsychologie, Band 13, Heft 1. Wiley Online Library (paywall). Access date: 2020-08-26. Finally, the male lays a spermatophore, a sperm capsule covered in gossamer, which the female takes into her body via her ovipositor to fertilize her eggs. The female lays groups of fewer than 60 eggs at once, deposited in small crevices. The eggs are oval- shaped, whitish, about long, and take between two weeks and two months to hatch. A silverfish usually lays fewer than 100 eggs in her lifetime. When the nymphs hatch, they are whitish in colour, and look like smaller adults. As they moult, young silverfish develop a greyish appearance and a metallic shine, eventually becoming adults after three months to three years. They may go through 17 to 66 moults in their lifetimes, sometimes 30 in a single year‚Äîmany more than most insects. Silverfish are among the few types of insect that continue to moult after reaching adulthood.  Ecology  Pages in a book damaged by silverfish that consumed portions of it. Silverfish consume matter that contains polysaccharides, such as starches and dextrin in adhesives. These include book bindings, carpet, clothing, coffee, dandruff, glue, hair, some paints, paper, photos, plaster, and sugar. They will damage wallpaper in order to consume the paste. Silverfish can also cause damage to tapestries. Other substances they may eat include cotton, dead insects, linen, silk, leftover crumbs, or even their own exuvia (moulted exoskeleton). During famine, a silverfish may even consume leatherware and synthetic fabrics. Silverfish can live for a year or more without eating if water is available. Silverfish are considered household pests, due to their consumption and destruction of property. However, although they are responsible for the contamination of food and other types of damage, they do not transmit disease. Earwigs, house centipedes, and spiders such as the spitting spider Scytodes thoracica are known to be predators of silverfish. The essential oil of the Japanese cedar Cryptomeria japonica has been investigated as a repellent and insecticide against L. saccharinum, with promising results: filter paper impregnated with a concentration of 0.01 mg/cm of essential oil repelled 80% of silverfish, and an exposure to vapours of 0.16 mg/cm for 10 hours caused a 100% mortality rate.  Etymology and nomenclature  The scientific name for the species is Lepisma saccharinumLepisma saccharinum - IRMNG (originally saccharina; Linnaeus' 1758 description here), due to its tendency to eat starchy foods high in carbohydrates and protein, such as dextrin. However, the insect's more common name comes from its distinctive metallic appearance and fish-like shape. While the scientific name was established by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae, the common name has been in use since at least 1855. Most authors have historically treated the nomenclatural gender of Lepisma as feminine (also as specified in ICZN Direction 71 issued in 1957), but in 2018 the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature issued a formal ruling (ICZN Opinion 2427) stating the gender of Lepisma (and all genera with that ending) is neuter, following ICZN Article 30, which resulted in changes to the spelling of several well-known species, including Lepisma saccharinum.ICZN (2018) Opinion 2427 (Case 3704) ‚Äì Lepisma Linnaeus, 1758 (Insecta, Zygentoma, Lepismatidae): Direction 71 (1957) reversed. The Bulletin of Zoological Nomenclature, 75(1):290-294  Evolution  Together with jumping bristletails, the predecessors of silverfish are considered the earliest, most primitive insects. They evolved at the latest in mid-Devonian and possibly as early as late Silurian more than 400 million years ago. Some fossilized arthropod trackways from the Paleozoic Era, known as Stiaria intermedia and often attributed to jumping bristletails, may have been produced by silverfish.  Similar species  Ctenolepisma species Other similar insect species are also known as silverfish. Two other silverfish are common in North America, Ctenolepisma longicaudatum and Ctenolepisma quadriseriatum. Ctenolepisma urbanum is known as the urban silverfish. The Australian species most commonly referred to as silverfish is a different lepismatid, Acrotelsella devriesiana. The firebrat (Thermobia domestica) is like a silverfish, but with a mottled gray and brown body.

Most of it is in icecaps and glaciers (69%) and groundwater (30%), while all lakes, rivers and swamps combined only account for a small fraction (0.3%) of the Earth's total freshwater reserves. Water resources are natural resources of water that are potentially useful. Uses of water include agricultural, industrial, household, recreational and environmental activities. All living things require water to grow and reproduce. 97% of the water on the Earth is salt water and only three percent is fresh water; slightly over two thirds of this is frozen in glaciers and polar ice caps. The remaining unfrozen freshwater is found mainly as groundwater, with only a small fraction present above ground or in the air. Fresh water is a renewable resource, yet the world's supply of groundwater is steadily decreasing, with depletion occurring most prominently in Asia, South America and North America, although it is still unclear how much natural renewal balances this usage, and whether ecosystems are threatened. The framework for allocating water resources to water users (where such a framework exists) is known as water rights.  Sources of fresh water =Surface water = Lake Chungar√° and Parinacota volcano in northern Chile Surface water is water in a river, lake or fresh water wetland. Surface water is naturally replenished by precipitation and naturally lost through discharge to the oceans, evaporation, evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge. Although the only natural input to any surface water system is precipitation within its watershed, the total quantity of water in that system at any given time is also dependent on many other factors. These factors include storage capacity in lakes, wetlands and artificial reservoirs, the permeability of the soil beneath these storage bodies, the runoff characteristics of the land in the watershed, the timing of the precipitation and local evaporation rates. All of these factors also affect the proportions of water loss. Human activities can have a large and sometimes devastating impact on these factors. Humans often increase storage capacity by constructing reservoirs and decrease it by draining wetlands. Humans often increase runoff quantities and velocities by paving areas and channelizing the stream flow. The total quantity of water available at any given time is an important consideration. Some human water users have an intermittent need for water. For example, many farms require large quantities of water in the spring, and no water at all in the winter. To supply such a farm with water, a surface water system may require a large storage capacity to collect water throughout the year and release it in a short period of time. Other users have a continuous need for water, such as a power plant that requires water for cooling. To supply such a power plant with water, a surface water system only needs enough storage capacity to fill in when average stream flow is below the power plant's need. Nevertheless, over the long term the average rate of precipitation within a watershed is the upper bound for average consumption of natural surface water from that watershed. Natural surface water can be augmented by importing surface water from another watershed through a canal or pipeline. It can also be artificially augmented from any of the other sources listed here, however in practice the quantities are negligible. Humans can also cause surface water to be \\"lost\\" (i.e. become unusable) through pollution. Brazil is estimated to have the largest supply of fresh water in the world, followed by Russia and Canada. Image:Sinclair Wetlands.jpgPanorama of a natural wetland (Sinclair Wetlands, New Zealand) = Under river flow = Throughout the course of a river, the total volume of water transported downstream will often be a combination of the visible free water flow together with a substantial contribution flowing through rocks and sediments that underlie the river and its floodplain called the hyporheic zone. For many rivers in large valleys, this unseen component of flow may greatly exceed the visible flow. The hyporheic zone often forms a dynamic interface between surface water and groundwater from aquifers, exchanging flow between rivers and aquifers that may be fully charged or depleted. This is especially significant in karst areas where pot-holes and underground rivers are common. = Groundwater = Relative groundwater travel times in the subsurface Groundwater is fresh water located in the subsurface pore space of soil and rocks. It is also water that is flowing within aquifers below the water table. Sometimes it is useful to make a distinction between groundwater that is closely associated with surface water and deep groundwater in an aquifer (sometimes called \\"fossil water\\"). shipot is a common water source in Central Ukrainian villages Groundwater can be thought of in the same terms as surface water: inputs, outputs and storage. The critical difference is that due to its slow rate of turnover, groundwater storage is generally much larger (in volume) compared to inputs than it is for surface water. This difference makes it easy for humans to use groundwater unsustainably for a long time without severe consequences. Nevertheless, over the long term the average rate of seepage above a groundwater source is the upper bound for average consumption of water from that source. The natural input to groundwater is seepage from surface water. The natural outputs from groundwater are springs and seepage to the oceans. If the surface water source is also subject to substantial evaporation, a groundwater source may become saline. This situation can occur naturally under endorheic bodies of water, or artificially under irrigated farmland. In coastal areas, human use of a groundwater source may cause the direction of seepage to ocean to reverse which can also cause soil salinization. Humans can also cause groundwater to be \\"lost\\" (i.e. become unusable) through pollution. Humans can increase the input to a groundwater source by building reservoirs or detention ponds. = Frozen water = Newfoundland Several schemes have been proposed to make use of icebergs as a water source, however to date this has only been done for research purposes. Glacier runoff is considered to be surface water. The Himalayas, which are often called \\"The Roof of the World\\", contain some of the most extensive and rough high altitude areas on Earth as well as the greatest area of glaciers and permafrost outside of the poles. Ten of Asia's largest rivers flow from there, and more than a billion people's livelihoods depend on them. To complicate matters, temperatures there are rising more rapidly than the global average. In Nepal, the temperature has risen by 0.6 degrees Celsius over the last decade, whereas globally, the Earth has warmed approximately 0.7 degrees Celsius over the last hundred years.Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting = Desalination = Desalination is an artificial process by which saline water (generally sea water) is converted to fresh water. The most common desalination processes are distillation and reverse osmosis. Desalination is currently expensive compared to most alternative sources of water, and only a very small fraction of total human use is satisfied by desalination. It is usually only economically practical for high-valued uses (such as household and industrial uses) in arid areas. However, there is growth in desalination for agricultural use, and highly populated areas such as Singapore or California. The most extensive use is in the Persian Gulf.  Water uses = Agriculture = It is estimated that 70% of worldwide water is used for irrigation, with 15‚Äì35% of irrigation withdrawals being unsustainable. It takes around 2,000 ‚Äì 3,000 litres of water to produce enough food to satisfy one person's daily dietary need.UN Water ‚Äì Coping with Water Scarcity 2007. fao.org This is a considerable amount, when compared to that required for drinking, which is between two and five litres. To produce food for the now over 7 billion people who inhabit the planet today requires the water that would fill a canal ten metres deep, 100 metres wide and 2100 kilometres long.  Increasing water scarcity  Around fifty years ago, the common perception was that water was an infinite resource. At that time, there were fewer than half the current number of people on the planet. People were not as wealthy as today, consumed fewer calories and ate less meat, so less water was needed to produce their food. They required a third of the volume of water we presently take from rivers. Today, the competition for water resources is much more intense. This is because there are now seven billion people on the planet, their consumption of water-thirsty meat and vegetables is rising, and there is increasing competition for water from industry, urbanisation biofuel crops, and water reliant food items. In the future, even more water will be needed to produce food because the Earth's population is forecast to rise to 9 billion by 2050.United Nations Press Release POP/952, 13 March 2007. World population will increase by 2.5 billion by 2050 An additional 2.5 or 3 billion people, choosing to eat fewer cereals and more meat and vegetables could add an additional five million kilometres to the virtual canal mentioned above. An assessment of water management in agriculture sector was conducted in 2007 by the International Water Management Institute in Sri Lanka to see if the world had sufficient water to provide food for its growing population.Molden, D. (Ed.) (2007) Water for food, Water for life: A Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture. Earthscan/IWMI. It assessed the current availability of water for agriculture on a global scale and mapped out locations suffering from water scarcity. It found that a fifth of the world's people, more than 1.2 billion, live in areas of physical water scarcity, where there is not enough water to meet all demands. A further 1.6 billion people live in areas experiencing economic water scarcity, where the lack of investment in water or insufficient human capacity make it impossible for authorities to satisfy the demand for water. In addition, one third of the world's population does not have access to clean drinking water, which is more than 2.3 billion people. The report found that it would be possible to produce the food required in future, but that continuation of today's food production and environmental trends would lead to crises in many parts of the world. To avoid a global water crisis, farmers will have to strive to increase productivity to meet growing demands for food, while industry and cities find ways to use water more efficiently.Chartres, C. and Varma, S. (2010) Out of water. From Abundance to Scarcity and How to Solve the World‚Äôs Water Problems FT Press (USA). In some areas of the world, irrigation is necessary to grow any crop at all, in other areas it permits more profitable crops to be grown or enhances crop yield. Various irrigation methods involve different trade-offs between crop yield, water consumption and capital cost of equipment and structures. Irrigation methods such as furrow and overhead sprinkler irrigation are usually less expensive but are also typically less efficient, because much of the water evaporates, runs off or drains below the root zone. Other irrigation methods considered to be more efficient include drip or trickle irrigation, surge irrigation, and some types of sprinkler systems where the sprinklers are operated near ground level. These types of systems, while more expensive, usually offer greater potential to minimize runoff, drainage and evaporation. Any system that is improperly managed can be wasteful, all methods have the potential for high efficiencies under suitable conditions, appropriate irrigation timing and management. Some issues that are often insufficiently considered are salinization of groundwater and contaminant accumulation leading to water quality declines. As global populations grow, and as demand for food increases in a world with a fixed water supply, there are efforts under way to learn how to produce more food with less water, through improvements in irrigation methods and technologies, agricultural water management, crop types, and water monitoring. Aquaculture is a small but growing agricultural use of water. Freshwater commercial fisheries may also be considered as agricultural uses of water, but have generally been assigned a lower priority than irrigation (see Aral Sea and Pyramid Lake). = Industries = A power plant in Poland It is estimated that 22% of worldwide water is used in industry. Major industrial users include hydroelectric dams, thermoelectric power plants, which use water for cooling, ore and oil refineries, which use water in chemical processes, and manufacturing plants, which use water as a solvent. Water withdrawal can be very high for certain industries, but consumption is generally much lower than that of agriculture. Water is used in renewable power generation. Hydroelectric power derives energy from the force of water flowing downhill, driving a turbine connected to a generator. This hydroelectricity is a low- cost, non-polluting, renewable energy source. Significantly, hydroelectric power can also be used for load following unlike most renewable energy sources which are intermittent. Ultimately, the energy in a hydroelectric powerplant is supplied by the sun. Heat from the sun evaporates water, which condenses as rain in higher altitudes and flows downhill. Pumped-storage hydroelectric plants also exist, which use grid electricity to pump water uphill when demand is low, and use the stored water to produce electricity when demand is high. Hydroelectric power plants generally require the creation of a large artificial lake. Evaporation from this lake is higher than evaporation from a river due to the larger surface area exposed to the elements, resulting in much higher water consumption. The process of driving water through the turbine and tunnels or pipes also briefly removes this water from the natural environment, creating water withdrawal. The impact of this withdrawal on wildlife varies greatly depending on the design of the powerplant. Pressurized water is used in water blasting and water jet cutters. Also, very high pressure water guns are used for precise cutting. It works very well, is relatively safe, and is not harmful to the environment. It is also used in the cooling of machinery to prevent overheating, or prevent saw blades from overheating. This is generally a very small source of water consumption relative to other uses. Water is also used in many large scale industrial processes, such as thermoelectric power production, oil refining, fertilizer production and other chemical plant use, and natural gas extraction from shale rock. Discharge of untreated water from industrial uses is pollution. Pollution includes discharged solutes (chemical pollution) and increased water temperature (thermal pollution). Industry requires pure water for many applications and utilizes a variety of purification techniques both in water supply and discharge. Most of this pure water is generated on site, either from natural freshwater or from municipal grey water. Industrial consumption of water is generally much lower than withdrawal, due to laws requiring industrial grey water to be treated and returned to the environment. Thermoelectric power plants using cooling towers have high consumption, nearly equal to their withdrawal, as most of the withdrawn water is evaporated as part of the cooling process. The withdrawal, however, is lower than in once- through cooling systems. = Domestic use[house hold] = Drinking water It is estimated that 8% of worldwide water use is for domestic purposes. These include drinking water, bathing, cooking, toilet flushing, cleaning, laundry and gardening. Basic domestic water requirements have been estimated by Peter Gleick at around 50 liters per person per day, excluding water for gardens. Drinking water is water that is of sufficiently high quality so that it can be consumed or used without risk of immediate or long term harm. Such water is commonly called potable water. In most developed countries, the water supplied to domestic, commerce and industry is all of drinking water standard even though only a very small proportion is actually consumed or used in food preparation. = Recreation = Whitewater rapids Sustainable management of water resources (including provision of safe and reliable supplies for drinking water and irrigation, adequate sanitation, protection of aquatic ecosystems, and flood protection) poses enormous challenges in many parts of the world. Recreational water use is usually a very small but growing percentage of total water use. Recreational water use is mostly tied to reservoirs. If a reservoir is kept fuller than it would otherwise be for recreation, then the water retained could be categorized as recreational usage. Release of water from a few reservoirs is also timed to enhance whitewater boating, which also could be considered a recreational usage. Other examples are anglers, water skiers, nature enthusiasts and swimmers. Recreational usage is usually non-consumptive. Golf courses are often targeted as using excessive amounts of water, especially in drier regions. It is, however, unclear whether recreational irrigation (which would include private gardens) has a noticeable effect on water resources. This is largely due to the unavailability of reliable data. Additionally, many golf courses utilize either primarily or exclusively treated effluent water, which has little impact on potable water availability. Some governments, including the Californian Government, have labelled golf course usage as agricultural in order to deflect environmentalists' charges of wasting water. However, using the above figures as a basis, the actual statistical effect of this reassignment is close to zero. In Arizona, an organized lobby has been established in the form of the Golf Industry Association, a group focused on educating the public on how golf impacts the environment. Recreational usage may reduce the availability of water for other users at specific times and places. For example, water retained in a reservoir to allow boating in the late summer is not available to farmers during the spring planting season. Water released for whitewater rafting may not be available for hydroelectric generation during the time of peak electrical demand. = Environment = Explicit environment water use is also a very small but growing percentage of total water use. Environmental water may include water stored in impoundments and released for environmental purposes (held environmental water), but more often is water retained in waterways through regulatory limits of abstraction.National Water Commission (2010). Australian environmental water management report. NWC, Canberra Environmental water usage includes watering of natural or artificial wetlands, artificial lakes intended to create wildlife habitat, fish ladders, and water releases from reservoirs timed to help fish spawn, or to restore more natural flow regimes Like recreational usage, environmental usage is non-consumptive but may reduce the availability of water for other users at specific times and places. For example, water release from a reservoir to help fish spawn may not be available to farms upstream, and water retained in a river to maintain waterway health would not be available to water abstractors downstream.  Water stress  Estimate of the share of people in developing countries with access to drinking water 1970‚Äì2000 Global water stress map The concept of water stress is relatively simple: According to the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, it applies to situations where there is not enough water for all uses, whether agricultural, industrial or domestic. Defining thresholds for stress in terms of available water per capita is more complex, however, entailing assumptions about water use and its efficiency. Nevertheless, it has been proposed that when annual per capita renewable freshwater availability is less than 1,700 cubic meters, countries begin to experience periodic or regular water stress. Below 1,000 cubic meters, water scarcity begins to hamper economic development and human health and well-being. = Population growth = In 2000, the world population was 6.2 billion. The UN estimates that by 2050 there will be an additional 3.5 billion people with most of the growth in developing countries that already suffer water stress. Thus, water demand will increase unless there are corresponding increases in water conservation and recycling of this vital resource. In building on the data presented here by the UN, the World Bank goes on to explain that access to water for producing food will be one of the main challenges in the decades to come. Access to water will need to be balanced with the importance of managing water itself in a sustainable way while taking into account the impact of climate change, and other environmental and social variables. = Expansion of business activity= Business activity ranging from industrialization to services such as tourism and entertainment continues to expand rapidly. This expansion requires increased water services including both supply and sanitation, which can lead to more pressure on water resources and natural ecosystem. =Rapid urbanization = The trend towards urbanization is accelerating. Small private wells and septic tanks that work well in low-density communities are not feasible within high-density urban areas. Urbanization requires significant investment in water infrastructure in order to deliver water to individuals and to process the concentrations of wastewater ‚Äì both from individuals and from business. These polluted and contaminated waters must be treated or they pose unacceptable public health risks. In 60% of European cities with more than 100,000 people, groundwater is being used at a faster rate than it can be replenished. Even if some water remains available, it costs increasingly more to capture it. = Climate change = Climate change could have significant impacts on water resources around the world because of the close connections between the climate and hydrological cycle. Rising temperatures will increase evaporation and lead to increases in precipitation, though there will be regional variations in rainfall. Both droughts and floods may become more frequent in different regions at different times, and dramatic changes in snowfall and snow melt are expected in mountainous areas. Higher temperatures will also affect water quality in ways that are not well understood. Possible impacts include increased eutrophication. Climate change could also mean an increase in demand for farm irrigation, garden sprinklers, and perhaps even swimming pools. There is now ample evidence that increased hydrologic variability and change in climate has and will continue have a profound impact on the water sector through the hydrologic cycle, water availability, water demand, and water allocation at the global, regional, basin, and local levels. = Depletion of aquifers = Due to the expanding human population, competition for water is growing such that many of the world's major aquifers are becoming depleted. This is due both for direct human consumption as well as agricultural irrigation by groundwater. Millions of pumps of all sizes are currently extracting groundwater throughout the world. Irrigation in dry areas such as northern China, Nepal and India is supplied by groundwater, and is being extracted at an unsustainable rate. Cities that have experienced aquifer drops between 10 and 50 meters include Mexico City, Bangkok, Beijing, Madras and Shanghai. = Pollution and water protection = Polluted water Water pollution is one of the main concerns of the world today. The governments of numerous countries have striven to find solutions to reduce this problem. Many pollutants threaten water supplies, but the most widespread, especially in developing countries, is the discharge of raw sewage into natural waters; this method of sewage disposal is the most common method in underdeveloped countries, but also is prevalent in quasi-developed countries such as China, India, Nepal and Iran. Sewage, sludge, garbage, and even toxic pollutants are all dumped into the water. Even if sewage is treated, problems still arise. Treated sewage forms sludge, which may be placed in landfills, spread out on land, incinerated or dumped at sea.Ocean dumping of sewage sludge is prohibited in the United States by the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA). In addition to sewage, nonpoint source pollution such as agricultural runoff is a significant source of pollution in some parts of the world, along with urban stormwater runoff and chemical wastes dumped by industries and governments. = Water and conflicts = Competition for water has widely increased, and it has become more difficult to conciliate the necessities for water supply for human consumption, food production, ecosystems and other uses. Water administration is frequently involved in contradictory and complex problems. Approximately 10% of the worldwide annual runoff is used for human necessities. Several areas of the world are flooded, while others have such low precipitations that human life is almost impossible. As population and development increase, raising water demand, the possibility of problems inside a certain country or region increases, as it happens with others outside the region. Over the past 25 years, politicians, academics and journalists have frequently predicted that disputes over water would be a source of future wars. Commonly cited quotes include: that of former Egyptian Foreign Minister and former Secretary-General of the United Nations Boutrous Ghali, who forecast, ‚ÄúThe next war in the Middle East will be fought over water, not politics‚Äù; his successor at the UN, Kofi Annan, who in 2001 said, ‚ÄúFierce competition for fresh water may well become a source of conflict and wars in the future,‚Äù and the former Vice President of the World Bank, Ismail Serageldin, who said the wars of the next century will be over water unless significant changes in governance occurred. The water wars hypothesis had its roots in earlier research carried out on a small number of transboundary rivers such as the Indus, Jordan and Nile. These particular rivers became the focus because they had experienced water-related disputes. Specific events cited as evidence include Israel's bombing of Syria's attempts to divert the Jordan's headwaters, and military threats by Egypt against any country building dams in the upstream waters of the Nile. However, while some links made between conflict and water were valid, they did not necessarily represent the norm. The only known example of an actual inter-state conflict over water took place between 2500 and 2350 BC between the Sumerian states of Lagash and Umma. Water stress has most often led to conflicts at local and regional levels. Tensions arise most often within national borders, in the downstream areas of distressed river basins. Areas such as the lower regions of China's Yellow River or the Chao Phraya River in Thailand, for example, have already been experiencing water stress for several years. Water stress can also exacerbate conflicts and political tensions which are not directly caused by water. Gradual reductions over time in the quality and/or quantity of fresh water can add to the instability of a region by depleting the health of a population, obstructing economic development, and exacerbating larger conflicts.  Shared water resources can promote collaboration  Water resources that span international boundaries are more likely to be a source of collaboration and cooperation than war. Scientists working at the International Water Management Institute have been investigating the evidence behind water war predictions. Their findings show that, while it is true there has been conflict related to water in a handful of international basins, in the rest of the world's approximately 300 shared basins the record has been largely positive. This is exemplified by the hundreds of treaties in place guiding equitable water use between nations sharing water resources. The institutions created by these agreements can, in fact, be one of the most important factors in ensuring cooperation rather than conflict.Promoting cooperation through management of transboundary water resources, Success Stories, Issue 8, 2010, IWMI The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) published the book Share: Managing water across boundaries. One chapter covers the functions of trans-boundary institutions and how they can be designed to promote cooperation, overcome initial disputes and find ways of coping with the uncertainty created by climate change. It also covers how the effectiveness of such institutions can be monitored. = Water shortages = In 2025, water shortages will be more prevalent among poorer countries where resources are limited and population growth is rapid, such as the Middle East, Africa, and parts of Asia. By 2025, large urban and peri-urban areas will require new infrastructure to provide safe water and adequate sanitation. This suggests growing conflicts with agricultural water users, who currently consume the majority of the water used by humans. Generally speaking the more developed countries of North America, Europe and Russia will not see a serious threat to water supply by the year 2025, not only because of their relative wealth, but more importantly their populations will be better aligned with available water resources. North Africa, the Middle East, South Africa and northern China will face very severe water shortages due to physical scarcity and a condition of overpopulation relative to their carrying capacity with respect to water supply. Most of South America, Sub-Saharan Africa, Southern China and India will face water supply shortages by 2025; for these latter regions the causes of scarcity will be economic constraints to developing safe drinking water, as well as excessive population growth.  Economic considerations  Water supply and sanitation require a huge amount of capital investment in infrastructure such as pipe networks, pumping stations and water treatment works. It is estimated that Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) nations need to invest at least US$200 billion per year to replace aging water infrastructure to guarantee supply, reduce leakage rates and protect water quality. International attention has focused upon the needs of the developing countries. To meet the Millennium Development Goals targets of halving the proportion of the population lacking access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation by 2015, current annual investment on the order of US$10 to US$15 billion would need to be roughly doubled. This does not include investments required for the maintenance of existing infrastructure. Once infrastructure is in place, operating water supply and sanitation systems entails significant ongoing costs to cover personnel, energy, chemicals, maintenance and other expenses. The sources of money to meet these capital and operational costs are essentially either user fees, public funds or some combination of the two. An increasing dimension to consider is the flexibility of the water supply system.

Behind the figure of the graphist Raimundo Ongaro (also close to the film movement Grupo Cine Liberaci√≥n), it gathered opponents to the \\"participationists\\" (the latter including Augusto Vandor, then leader of the CGT, Jos√© Ignacio Rucci, Jos√© Alonso, etc.) who supported collaboration with Juan Carlos Ongan√≠a's military dictatorship (1966‚Äì1970). The CGTA gathered many unionist delegates who refused to participate to the Normalisation Congress, opposing collaboration with the junta. It had support from various artists, among whom Rodolfo Walsh, author of the \\"Program of 1st of May\\" of the CGTA and chief editor of its weekly. The CGTA was also close to the clerical Movimiento de Sacerdotes para el Tercer Mundo, a group of priests close to the Liberation Theology, forming one of the first model of Neoperonism. The CGTA supported the more radical unions' branches (ports, oil, sugar industry, etc.), quickly establishing national scale. It was headed in Cordoba by the leader of the Cordobese trade union Luz y Fuerza, Agust√≠n Tosco. They took an important part in the Cordobazo uprising and the call for a general strike, which occurred on 30 June 1969, hours following Augusto Vandor's assassination. Thereafter, most of its leaders, including Raimundo Ongaro, Agust√≠n Tosco, Elpidio Torres, Lorenzo Pepe, etc., were jailed. Following the failure of a 120 days strike at the Fabril Financiera, and the reconciliation between Augusto Vandor, leader of the \\"participationists\\", with Juan Per√≥n, the CGTA witnessed many of its unions joining the 62 Organisations, the Peronist political front of the CGT.

It also has the highest percentage, internationally, of physically challenged children. Its current 2,000 members are active in approximately 20 sport fields, mostly in wheelchairs. Today, the center houses a wide variety of sport fields: Swimming, wheelchair basketball, wheelchair soccer, table tennis, wheelchair tennis, wheelchair athletics and tricycle races. It also houses a gym, private sport sessions and classes of hydrotherapy and paramedical care. Members of the ISCD take part, since its establishment, in the Stoke Mandeville Games and the Paralympic Games. Their achievements gained Israel a reputation in the field of rehabilitation. The wheelchair basketball team of the center had so far won two paralympic gold medals, two world championships and three European championships. The center was used for hosting the 1968 Summer Paralympics. Nowadays, it is also a social meeting place for its members and houses different programs of yoga and wheelchair dancing. On its premises is also a kindergarten for disabled children of 3 - 7. The administrative staff of the ISCD includes its director, Jacob Ben-Arie, a gold medal winning paralympic champion, and head coach Baruch Hagai, a paralympic champion and winner of the 2001 Israel Prize in sports. The ISCD is sponsored by donations in Israel and worldwide, with only 1% of its budget subsidized by the state. ISCD Friends organizations are found in the United States and the United Kingdom.

In Olympic Review. July 1985. p. 400. Besides competing at the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam, Paulen was also a member of the Organizing Committee. Stepping down from his athletic career in 1931, Paulen also participated in the Monte Carlo Rally eight times and once competed in the Dutch TT MotoGP event. In his youth, Paulen competed in football (soccer) at an international level. World War II When Nazi Germany invaded the Netherlands in May 1940, Paulen joined the Nederlandse Unie, an organisation that strived for co-operation with the German occupier. In August 1940 Paulen participated in fusion talks between the Nederlandse Unie and the fascistic Nationaal Front, which original name was Zwart Front (Black Front). Other participants for the Nederlandse Unie during these talks were Jan de Quay, after the war minister-president, Louis Einthoven, former head of the Rotterdam police and afterwar director of the BVD (secret service) and Hans Linthorst Homan, commissioner of the Queen in the province Groningen. For the Nationaal Front the infamous fascist Leader Arnold Meijer was head of a four men delegation. During these talks Jan de Quay, head of the delegation of the Nederlandse Unie, called himself a fascist, the Nederlandse Unie a fascistic organisation and said that he opposed democracy. The fusion talks failed.Stenographic report on the fusion talks between the Nederlandse Unie and Nationaal Front, August 1940, Archive of Zwart Front, Brabants Historisch Informatie Centrum, 's-Hertogenbosch, The Netherlands. Later during the war Paulen was engineer at a coal mining industry Staatsmijnen. Workers started a strike and Paulen refused to give the Germans a list of strikers and was convicted to death, however Paulen was released soon. In 1944 Paulen crossed the front and joined the allied troops. Paulen met some of the British Army forces during Operation Market Garden in September 1944.Adriaan Paulen diary from September 16, 1944 to January 5, 1945 -- accessed July 24, 2008. Paulen kept a diary regarding Operation Market Garden and its aftermath that was released to the public in 1989, four years after his 1985 death, including meeting with United States Army officials during that time and would eventually be made a Colonel in the US Army. = Medal of Freedom and Knighthood = On 7 January 1946, by general order number 8, Paulen was awarded the US Medal of Freedom with bronze palm. On 12 September 1947, by Royal Decree, Paulen was knighted by Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, receiving the fourth class (Knight) of the Military William Order. The Order is the highest and oldest military honour of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, bestowed for \\"performing excellent acts of Bravery, Leadership and Loyalty in battle\\". The award is comparable to the British Victoria Cross and seldom awarded. Sporting official Following the end of World War II, Paulen played a key role in rebuilding the IAAF in 1946. He also served as president from the Dutch Athletic Committee (KNAU) from 1946 to 1964.Haarlem Track Club profile of Paulen. -- accessed July 24, 2008. In 1965, Paulen served as director of the Dutch Olympic Committee, a position he held until 1970. While working for the KNAU and Dutch Olympic Committee, he also served as an official for the IAAF. Paulen's best known role as an IAAF official was at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich when he was responsible for the \\"Cata-Pole\\" controversy in the men's pole vault and the claim by the pole manufacturers that their poles did not contain carbon fiber even though IAAF rules stated no such requirements.Wallechinsky, David and Jaime Loucky (2008). \\"Track & Field (Men): Pole Vault\\".

This controversy had a negative impact upon competition which the United States would lose the pole vault gold for the first time in the Summer Olympics. Bob Seagren, who won the pole vault gold at Mexico City in 1968, would finish with silver at Munich. At the end of the competition, Seagren thrust the pole into Paulen's lap, stating he \\"was returning the unwanted pole back to ...[Paulen].\\" Paulen succeeded David Burghley as IAAF President in 1976 and served in that position until 1981. During Paulen's tenure, he led the fight to control doping within athletics. Death and legacy Paulen died during an operation on a broken hip in 1985.

The reflex is named after Albert von Bezold and Adolf Jarisch Junior. The significance of the discovery is that it was the first recognition of a chemical (non-mechanical) reflex. History and Physiology Memorial plaque for Albert von Bezold in Jena. von Bezold and Hirt described a reaction comprising a triad of bradycardia, hypotension, and apnea (hypopnea) resulting from an intravenous injection of an alkaloidal extract of Veratrum viride or Viscum album in 1867. This observation was comparatively neglected until Jarisch and Henze re-examined it in 1937; they identified the reaction as a chemoreflex acting via the vagus nerve that was relayed in the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS), and termed it the Bezold reflex. It is now usually called the Bezold‚ÄìJarisch reflex; however the cardiac bradycardia and hypopnea arise from anatomically distinct receptors in the heart and lung respectively and whether hypopnea should be regarded as part of the reflex is disputed. The afferent cardiac neurons relevant to the Bezold‚ÄìJarisch reflex have cell bodies in the nodose ganglion and the dorsal root ganglion. They manifest two types of nerve endings in the heart: complex unencapsulated endings located in the atrial and ventricular endocardium and an endocardial nerve network throughout the surface of the endocardium. The axons include myelinated fibers (A-fiber) and unmyelinated fibers (C-fibers) which travel with the vagus and sympathetic nerves. The myelinated afferents originating in the atria are attached to discrete receptor endings, whereas most of the unmyelinated fibers are located in the ventricles and the walls of the coronary vessels. Vagal afferent C fibers originating in the heart and lungs terminate in the NTS, while axons from the heart also inhibit sympathetic nervous activity via the caudal ventrolateral medulla (CVLM) and possibly the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM). The sites of the chemoreflex and baroreflex input overlap and there is evidence that these reflexes modify each other, probably through the actions of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and Gamma- Aminobutyric acid (GABA). Although the reflex was originally described in response to Veratrum alkaloids, it can be stimulated by many biologically active chemicals, including nicotine, capsaicin, bradykinin, atrial natriuretic peptide, prostanoids, nitrovasodilators, angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) antagonists and serotonin agonists.eMedicine - Syncope : Article by M Silvana Horenstein, MD It may also contribute to various pathophysiological responses, such as: * Severe hemorrhage and hypovolemia: During severe hemorrhage or profound hypovolemia the ventricle can become relatively empty and trigger cardiac vagal afferent fibers to elicit the Bezold‚ÄìJarisch reflex resulting in paradoxical bradycardia, vasodilation, and hypotension. * Myocardial ischemia: Chemoreceptors located in the ventricles respond to myocardial ischemia, resulting in an increase in blood flow to the myocardium and a decrease in the work of the heart. This appears to be a cardioprotective reflex, as coronary vasodilation occurs. The pathway for this cardioprotective reflex begins with receptors in the ventricles of the heart, which detect mechanical and chemical stimuli. Afferent unmyelinated C-fibers travel through the vagus to enhance the baroreceptor reflex mechanisms, inhibit sympathetic output, and inhibit vasomotor tone, leading to peripheral vasodilation. The Bezold‚ÄìJarisch reflex is thought to be responsible for the sinus bradycardia that commonly occurs within the first hour following a myocardial infarction, and may explain the frequent occurrence of atrio- ventricular (AV) node block in acute posterior or inferior myocardial infarction. Bradycardia in this setting may be treated with atropine. * Hypotension during coronary reperfusion * Hypotension following injection of contrast media during coronary angiography * Exertional syncope in aortic stenosis: in severe aortic stenosis exercise may cause a rise in left ventricular pressure which stimulates the Bezold‚ÄìJarisch reflex and results in reflex vasodilation and syncope. * Spinal anesthesia: The Bezold‚ÄìJarisch reflex has been suggested as a possible cause of profound bradycardia and circulatory collapse after spinal anesthesia and interscalene brachial plexus block.Miller's Anesthesia Ch.52 Pg. 1642 * Vaso-vagal syncope: the role of the Bezold‚ÄìJarisch reflex in vaso-vagal syncope is unclear. Upright posture results in pooling of blood in the lower extremities that diminishes venous return and results in a reduced cardiac output. The resultant lowering of blood pressure is sensed by carotid sinus baroreceptors, and stimulates the baroreflex to inhibit vagal activity and stimulate the sympathetic nervous system ‚Äì this increases heart rate and contractility, induces vasoconstriction, and tends to restore blood pressure. However, if the Bezold‚ÄìJarisch reflex is activated due to the reduced ventricular volume this may trigger paradoxical bradycardia and arterial hypotension resulting in syncope. The importance of this mechanism is unclear since vaso-vagal syncope can be observed in cardiac transplant patients who are presumed to lack cardiac innervation. If it operates this phenomenon would be expected to be exacerbated if the individual is dehydrated. It has also been proposed that this mechanism accounts for the increased susceptibility to orthostatic syncope of astronauts after space flights.

On 22 April 1979, at the age of 16, Kuntar participated in the killing of an Israeli policeman and the attempted kidnapping of an Israeli family in Nahariya that resulted in the deaths of four Israelis and two of his fellow kidnappers. Kuntar and his team broke into an apartment building and kidnapped a father, 31-year-old Danny Haran, and his 4-year-old daughter, Einat, taking them to a nearby beach. According to eyewitnesses and forensic reports, Kuntar shot Danny to death at close range, and then killed the girl Einat by smashing her skull against the rocks with the butt of his rifle. During the attack, Smadar Haran accidentally suffocated her two-year-old daughter Yael to death while attempting to quiet her whimpering, which would have revealed their hiding place. Newsweek states that the details of Kuntar's attack are \\"so sickening they give pause even to some of Israel's enemies.\\" After his release, Kuntar became a senior official in Hezbollah. According to Druze sources, Hezbollah put Kuntar in charge of the Quneitra Governorate during the Syrian Civil War, where he commanded attacks against Israeli targets.

On 21 December, the Free Syrian Army released a video clip claiming responsibility for killing Kuntar. Early life Kuntar was born to a Druze family in Lebanon. His parents divorced soon after his birth and his mother died when he was a boy. The father remarried and moved to Saudi Arabia, leaving Samir in the care of his second wife, Siham, in Abey, a village southeast of Beirut. Kuntar dropped out of school at 14 and underwent training in the camps of various Palestinian militant groups and became a member of the Palestine Liberation Front. His goal was to take part in an attack on Israel. Hijacking attempt On 31 January 1978 Samir Kuntar and three additional militants from his organization attempted to hijack an Israeli bus running the line between Beit She'an and Tiberias in order to demand the release of militants imprisoned in Israel. They traveled to Jordan and attempted to cross the Jordan river into Israel by swimming. However, before crossing, they were arrested by the Jordanian intelligence. Kuntar spent 11 months in Jordanian prison and was released in December 1978. He was banned from entering Jordan for three years.(Machine translated using babylon software) Raid from Southern Lebanon On 22 April 1979, at the age of 16, Samir Kuntar led a group of four PLF militants who entered Israel from Lebanon by boat.Gontarz, Nir, \\"The Kuntar File, Exposed\\" Yediot Aharonot, July 14, 2008. Translated by the website of the Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Retrieved July 17, 2008. The group members included Abdel Majeed Aslan (born 1955), Muhanna Salim al-Muayyad (born 1960) and Ahmad al-Abras (born 1949). They all belonged to the PLF under the leadership of Abu Abbas. The group departed from the Tyre seashore in Southern Lebanon using a 55-hp motorized rubber boat with an 88 km/h speed. The goal of the operation was to attack Nahariya, 10 kilometers away from the Lebanese border. They named it \\"Operation Nasser\\". Around midnight, they arrived at the coastal town of Nahariya. The four first killed Eliyahu Shachar, a policeman who encountered them. The group then entered a building on Jabotinsky Street where they split into pairs. One group broke into the apartment of the Haran family before police reinforcements had arrived. They took 31 year-old Danny Haran hostage along with his four-year-old daughter Einat. According to Samir Kuntar, Danny Haran would not let go of his daughter and come with them alone. The mother, Smadar Haran, was able to hide in a crawl space above the bedroom with her two-year-old daughter Yael, and a neighbor. Danny, Einat and Yael Haran. According to eyewitnesses and forensic reports, Kuntar shot Danny at close range in the back, in front of his daughter, and then killed the girl Einat, by smashing her skull against the rocks with the butt of his rifle. Kuntar's group took Danny and Einat down to the beach, where a shoot-out with Israeli policemen and soldiers erupted. According to the official Israeli version, when Kuntar's group found that the rubber boat they had arrived in was disabled by gunfire, Kuntar shot Danny at close range in the back, in front of his daughter, and drowned him in the sea to ensure he was dead. Next, he smashed the head of 4 year-old Einat on beach rocks and crushed her skull with the butt of his rifle.

Kuntar and the fourth member of the group, Ahmad Assad al-Abras, were injured and captured. al-Abras was freed by Israel in the prisoner exchange of May 1985. Trial The pathologist's report, declassified in 2008, showed that 4 year old Einat Haran's brain tissue was found on Kuntar's rifle Kuntar and al-Abras were charged with murder. During interrogation Kuntar had signed a confession accepting responsibility for the deaths of the policeman and of Danny and Einat Haran. At the trial, however, he denied killing either the father or the daughter. His defense claimed that he had been beaten in the detention center. Kuntar explained that the group's goal had been to take hostages back to Lebanon, and that he had taken the 4-year-old to prevent Israeli police from shooting at them. According to him Danny Haran suddenly rose up, shouting and signalling to the Israeli soldiers to stop shooting. Both of them were then hit by the soldiers' bullets, killing Haran and seriously wounding Kuntar and rendering him unconscious. He claimed to have no knowledge of the fate of the girl. An anonymous witness for the prosecution confirmed that Haran had shouted to the soldiers \\"Cease your fire, don't shoot, my little girl is here,\\" but that Kuntar then shot him in the back. An Israeli physician testified at the trial that the child was killed by \\"a blow from a blunt instrument, like a club or rifle butt.\\" The pathologist's report showed that Einat's brain matter was found on Kuntar's rifle. Both Kuntar and al-Abras were convicted of murdering five people, two policemen and three members of the Haran family. They were sentenced to five life sentences, and an additional forty-seven years for injuries inflicted. The court file containing the evidence submitted and the court proceedings was declared top secret and no one, with the exception of the pardons committee, was allowed to access the file for almost 30 years. A few days before Kuntar's expected release in the 2008 Israel‚ÄìHezbollah prisoner exchange, Yedioth Ahronoth was finally given access to Court File No. 578/79, with two notable exceptions. At his trial, and consistently thereafter, Kuntar denied killing the 4-year-old or her father.Heller, Aron, \\"For Israel, prisoner swap evokes raw memories\\", Associated Press, July 16, 2008.

According to a former cellmate, Yasser Hanjar, al-Kuntar \\"never expressed remorse, but maintains a different version [of the events] than the Israeli one\\", that he only wanted to take the Israeli family hostage, and that he \\"firmly rejected allegations he had smashed the head of 4-year-old Einat Haran.\\" After his release, al-Kuntar accused the Israeli government of fabricating the story of how he killed the child.\\"Kuntar accuses Israel of fabricating story of Child Killing\\", Monsters and Critics, July 17, 2008. A psychologist, Zvi Sela, served as Chief Intelligence Officer of the Israel Prison Service and met al- Kuntar in prison in this capacity. In an interview with Haaretz he claimed that he believed Kuntar's version: > We turned Kuntar into God-knows-what ‚Äì the murderer of Danny Haran and his > daughter, Einat.

You can accuse > him all you like, but it was obviously the rescue forces that opened fire. According to Sela, Kuntar also said that he would not go back to terrorism, if released. Treatment in prison During his imprisonment, Kuntar married Kifah Kayyal (born in 1963), an Israeli Arab woman who is an activist on behalf of militant prisoners. They later divorced. While they were married, she received a monthly stipend from the Israeli government, an entitlement due to her status as a wife of a prisoner. Kayyal is an Israeli citizen of Palestinian origin from Acre, now residing in Ramallah, who was then serving a life sentence for her activities in the Palestine Liberation Front. Kuntar was allowed conjugal visits with his wife while in prison. They had no children. In addition, while in prison Kuntar participated in a program under which Palestinian security prisoners took correspondence courses from the Open University of Israel, and graduated with a bachelor's degree in social and political science.\\"A searing contrast\\", Jerusalem Post, July 16, 2008. Negotiations for release Several years later, the Palestine Liberation Front seized the MS Achille Lauro, an Italian cruise ship, demanding that Israel release Kuntar along with 50 Palestinian prisoners. Kuntar was the only prisoner specifically named. The hijackers killed Leon Klinghoffer, a wheelchair-bound Jewish-American passenger, and threw his body and wheelchair overboard. In 2003, Israel agreed to release around 400 prisoners in exchange for businessman Elchanan Tenenbaum and the bodies of three soldiers held by Hezbollah since 2000. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah refused to accept the deal unless it included Samir Kuntar. \\"Hezbollah's conditions have become clear and defined, and we are sticking to them in all circumstances\\", Nasrallah declared in his statement.\\"Israel prisoner deal 'not enough'\\", BBC News, November 10, 2003.McGreal, Chris, \\"Israel backs deal with Hizbullah to swap prisoners\\", The Guardian, November 10, 2003. Israel then agreed to release Samir Kuntar on condition that Hezbollah provided \\"solid evidence\\" as to the fate of Ron Arad, an air force navigator missing in Lebanon since 1986.O'Sullivan, Arieh, Inspired by the prisoner swap, Hamas vowed, a few days later, that they would also abduct Israeli soldiers to secure the release of Palestinian prisoners. Hassan Nasrallah simultaneously told his supporters that Hezbollah would continue to kidnap Israelis until \\"not a single prisoner\\" remained inside Israeli jails. In 2006, Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora and UN envoy Terje R√∏d-Larsen proposed a deal in which Kuntar and all other Lebanese prisoners would be released on condition that Syria declared Shebaa farms as Lebanese territory, the Lebanese deployed troops on the country's southern border with Israel, Israel withdrew from Shebaa farms and the Israeli air force stopped flying over Lebanon, Israeli occupation ended, though Hezbollah was not disarmed and Hezbollah was not removed from the border areas. Prisoner exchange deal On 26 May 2008, Israeli sources announced that Samir Kuntar was among those who would be exchanged for the bodies of two reservists, Eldad Regev and Ehud Goldwasser, captured by Hezbollah in the cross-border raid that sparked the 2006 Lebanon War.Stern, Yoav and Yossi Melman, \\"Israel says Hezbollah exchange deal is close\\", Haaretz, May 27, 2008.

Retrieved July 20, 2008. Hezbollah arranged a public celebration in Dahieh (their stronghold in Beirut), where Hassan Nasrallah gave a welcoming speech to Kuntar. On 17 July 2008, Kuntar visited the tomb of Imad Mughniyeh. Later that day, a homecoming function was organized in Kuntar's native village of Aabey, southeast of Beirut. The ceremony was addressed by Progressive Socialist Party leader Walid Jumblatt and the Labour Minister and Hezbollah official, Mohammad Fneish. On 19 July 2008, Al Jazeera TV broadcast a program from Lebanon about Kuntar's welcoming festivities. In it, the head of Al Jazeera's Beirut office, Ghassan bin Jiddo, praised Kuntar, calling him a \\"pan-Arab hero\\", and organized a birthday party for him. In response, Israel's Government Press Office (GPO) threatened to boycott the satellite channel unless it apologized. A few days later, Al Jazeera's director general, Khanfar Wadah, issued a statement admitting parts of the program had violated the station's Code of Ethics, and ordered the channel's programming director to try to prevent a recurrence. ;In Syria On 24 November 2008, Kuntar visited Syria, where he met with President Bashar Assad. Assad awarded him the Syrian Order of Merit. Kuntar also visited Druze communities in the Syrian-controlled Golan Heights. At the ceasefire line with Israel, he used the opportunity to express solidarity with the Druze community in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights: \\"President Bashar Assad has promised me that he will help you,\\" Kuntar said. \\"I say to you, soon president Assad will fly the Syrian flag over the Golan.\\" Statements following his release After his release, Kuntar made a number of statements on certain elements of the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict. ;Prisoner exchange deal In an interview to Al-Manar, Hezbollah's satellite television network, Kuntar said: \\"I'm jealous of the Zionists, who don't spare any effort in bringing back captured soldiers or soldiers' bodies. Seriously, we are jealous of our enemy and its care for a [body] and how it goes to the end of the world in order to return it, and of its concerns for captives and how it will go to the very edge to bring them back.\\"Freed terrorist says he‚Äôs jealous of Israel, Jewish Telegraphic Agency (JTA), July 18, 2008. ;New attacks against Israel In an interview with Al-Jadid TV, which aired on 18 July 2008 (as translated by the MEMRI), Kuntar stated that: \\"There is a disease in this region called \\"the state of Israel,\\" which we refer to as \\"the plundering entity.\\" If we do not put an end to this disease, it will follow us, even if we flee to the end of the world.

Kuntar stated that: \\"[The assassination of Sadat was] a most wonderful operation ‚Äì to the point that all the prisoners cheered together when Sadat was assassinated. This man symbolized treason and apostasy. Ever since Camp David. ... Look at the history ‚Äì Camp David, the 1982 invasion, and then the strike against Iraq. ...

He is accused of being behind the attack on a Magen David Adom ambulance by Israeli Druze who claimed it was transporting Syrians to Israel for health care. In July 2015, it was claimed that Kuntar was targeted and possibly killed in an alleged Israeli drone strike upon his automobile in the Syrian-controlled Golan Heights town of Hader, along with members of Hezbollah and the Syrian National Defence Forces.Ariel Ben Solomon, \\"Terrorist Kuntar reportedly killed trying to enlist Druse support for Assad, Hezbollah\\", Jerusalem Post. 3 August 2015. Death On 19 December 2015, in the midst of the Syrian Civil War, Kuntar was killed by an explosion destroying a six-story residential building in Jaramana on the outskirts of Damascus. The explosion also killed eight Syrian nationals, among them Hezbollah field commanders, and injured a number of other people. According to official Syrian sources, Kuntar was killed by \\"rocket attack.\\" On 20 December, Syrian Information Minister Omran al-Zoubi described the incident as a terrorist operation \\"plotted beforehand,\\" noting that Syrian authorities were carrying out an investigation to find out how the operation happened. Hezbollah claimed that the building was destroyed by an air-to-surface missile launched by Israeli Air Force jets. Hezbollah alleged that two Israeli jets penetrated Syrian airspace. Hezbollah vowed revenge on Israel after the attack. On December 21, the Free Syrian Army released a video clip claiming responsibility for killing Kuntar and accusing Hezbollah of blaming Israel for propaganda purposes. In late February 2016, a remark by Israeli politician Omer Bar-Lev was interpreted as an admission that Israel was responsible for Kuntar's assassination.'MK confirms for first time: Israel killed Samir Kuntar,' The Times of Israel 27 February 2016.

Conducted by individual nations on different schedules, this primarily involves the conversion of analog terrestrial television broadcasting infrastructure to digital terrestrial (DTT), a major benefit being extra frequencies on the radio spectrum and lower broadcasting costs, as well as improved viewing qualities for consumers. The transition may also involve analog cable conversion to digital cable or internet protocol television, as well as analog to digital satellite television. Transition of land based broadcasting was begun by some countries around 2000. By contrast, transition of satellite television systems was well underway or completed in many countries by this time. It is an involved process because the existing analog television receivers owned by viewers cannot receive digital broadcasts; viewers must either purchase new digital TVs, or converter boxes which change the digital signal to an analog signal or some other form of a digital signal (i.e. HDMI) which can be received on the older TV. Usually during a transition, a simulcast service is operated where a broadcast is made available to viewers in both analog and digital at the same time. As digital becomes more popular, it is expected that the existing analog services will be removed. In most places this has already happened, where a broadcaster has offered incentives to viewers to encourage them to switch to digital. Government intervention usually involves providing some funding for broadcasters and, in some cases, monetary relief to viewers, to enable a switchover to happen by a given deadline. In addition, governments can also have a say with the broadcasters as to what digital standard to adopt - either DVB-T, ATSC, ISDB-T, or DTMB. Governments can also require all receiving equipment sold in a country to support the necessary digital 'tuner'. Before digital television, PAL and NTSC were used for both video processing within TV stations and for broadcasting to viewers. Because of this, the switchover process may also include the adoption of digital equipment utilizing Serial digital interface (SDI) on TV stations, replacing analog PAL or NTSC component or composite video equipment. Digital broadcasting standards are only used to broadcast video to viewers; Digital TV stations usually use SDI irrespective of broadcast standard, although it might be possible for a station still using analog equipment to convert its signal to digital before it is broadcast, or for a station to use digital equipment but convert the signal to analog for broadcasting, or they may have a mix of both digital and analog equipment. Digital TV signals require less transmission power to be broadcast satisfactorily. The switchover process is being accomplished on different schedules in different countries; in some countries it is being implemented in stages as in Australia, India or Mexico, where each region has a separate date to switch off. In others, the whole country switches on one date, such as the Netherlands. On 3 August 2003, Berlin became the world's first city to switch off terrestrial analog signals. Luxembourg was the first country to complete its terrestrial switchover, in September 2006.

Broadcasters around the world choose and adopt one of these to be the format and technology behind the transmission. The standards are: *The European-made DVB-T, adopted by most of Europe, Africa, Asia and Oceania *The American-made ATSC, adopted by much of the Americas and some of Asia and Oceania *The Japanese-made ISDB-T, adopted by some in Asia, most of South America, and a few in Africa *The Chinese-made DTMB, adopted by some in Asia and a few in Africa and the Americas =2006 Geneva Agreement= The \\"RRC-06\\" agreement in Geneva (hosted by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU)) was signed by delegates from many countries, including most of Europe, Africa and Asia. The agreement set 17 June 2015 as the date after which countries may use frequencies currently assigned for analog television transmission for digital services (specifically DVB-T), without being required to protect the analog services of neighbouring countries against interference. This date was generally viewed as an internationally mandated analog switch- off date, at least along national borders‚Äîexcept for those operating on the VHF band which would be allowed until 17 June 2020. These deadlines set by the agreement have been difficult to reach in certain regions, like in Africa where most countries missed the 2015 deadline, as well as South East Asia. High upgrade costs are often a reason cited to the slow transition in those regions. The European Commission, on a different note, had recommended on 28 October 2009 that digital switchover should be completed by 1 January 2012. =Digital-to-analog converters= Analog only TVs are incapable of receiving over-the-air broadcasts without the addition of a set-top converter box. Consequently, a digital converter box ‚Äì an electronic device that connects to an analog television ‚Äì must be used in order to allow the television to receive digital broadcasts. In the United States, the government subsidized the purchase of such boxes for consumers via their coupon-eligible converter box program in 2009, funded by a small part of the billions of dollars brought in by a spectrum auction. The program was managed by the Department of Commerce through its National Telecommunications and Information Administration. Televisions with integrated digital tuners have been available for a considerable time. This means that the need for a set-top box is usually no longer necessary with a new TV set. =Satellite and cable= Satellite broadcasting switched to digital much earlier than terrestrial broadcasting. The switchover process is much easier for satellite since only changes to the earth station equipment are needed on the transmission side and consumers are already used to having a set top box/decoder. In many places, the satellite switchover was complete before terrestrial switchover was even started. Cable on the other hand would switch off months, if not years after terrestrial would. In countries where terrestrial is little used, the migration to digital satellite or cable is more realized. For instance, in Switzerland or the UAE, where terrestrial has low usage, the terrestrial switchover was not noticed by the general population. But in countries where terrestrial is the dominant method of watching TV, like Japan, Spain or Thailand, the switchover is a big deal as it affects the majority of the population.

Analog shutdown was originally scheduled to occur in 2012, but on Thursday, 2 September 2010, Mexican government advanced the analog shutdown from 2012 to 2015. From 2013, areas began to be switched over regionally depending on the presence of digital terrestrial stations and a campaign headed by the SCT to distribute free television converters to households on the government welfare rolls. The first digital switchover was to begin on Tuesday, 28 May 2013 in Tijuana, but was postponed to 18 July due to the 2013 Baja California state elections. The switchover was completed nationwide on 31 December 2015, when all remaining analog television stations left the air. Mexico then instituted a nationwide remapping of network stations in late 2015 requiring most of them to map to the channel number in either Mexico City, or for regional networks, the main metro area served by the network's flagship station. * Complied with the FCC transition to ATSC digital on 12 June 2009 on all full-power stations. * adopted the ATSC standard for DTT and completed the analog switch off in 2015. * Complied with the FCC transition to ATSC digital on 12 June 2009 on all full-power stations. =Asia= * : The analog terrestrial transmissions were terminated on Monday, 13 February 2012 and was replaced by a multiplex for Nilesat.

Analog terrestrial television transmissions in the remainder of Ishikawa Prefecture and 43 other prefectures, as well as analog Broadcast Satellite and Wowow services, ended at noon on Sunday 24 July 2011, along with the analog satellite services; three remaining prefectures (Fukushima, Iwate, and Miyagi) that were destroyed or heavily damaged in the 11 March 2011 9.0 magnitude Tohoku earthquake and its related nuclear accidents stopped analog broadcasting at noon on Saturday, 31 March 2012. In both of those cases, the analog transmitters themselves were switched off at midnight on the same day. Analog high-definition television broadcasting ended on Sunday, 30 September 2007. An analog cable service (known as Dejiana since 1 July 2011) continued to be broadcast, but starting on 1 April 2012, all cable providers in Japan were required to convert from analog to digital services. Most analog cable services were terminated between 24 July 2011 and April 2015. All television stations across the country are now broadcasting only in digital, ending an analog-digital simulcast period that began on Monday 1 December 2003 in the Kant≈ç region (which expanded to all other prefectures over the next four years) and ended between 24 July 2011 and 31 March 2012 (when all analog transmissions were shut down). * : DTT services rolled out officially in 2014, and the transition to digital ended in 2017. * : Early DTT broadcasts were rolled out in January 2014 starting in selected test areas, while full nationwide coverage to an estimated 98% populated areas was expected by the end of the analogue-digital simulcast period. The official launch of digital broadcasts was on 6 June 2017 by the Prime Minister with an estimation of 4.2 million digital television decoders were to be given free to citizens, including recipients of the government aid of 1Malaysia People's Aid (BR1M). The Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Ministry(MCMM) further stated that analogue broadcasting throughout Malaysia will be turned off completely in September 2019 with full digital television broadcasting available by October. Langkawi was the first area to commence the digital switchover on 21 July 2019 at 02:30 AM (UTC+8). Later, on 6 August 2019, MCMM released the complete list of transition date on the remaining areas. The Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission(MCMC) announced in late September that the full digital transition was to be completed on 31 October 2019. The switchover was scheduled with central and southern West Malaysia on 30 September, northern and eastern coasts of West Malaysia on 14 October and entire East Malaysia on 31 October.

Flanders switched off analog television on Monday 3 November 2008, while in Wallonia, all analog services were switched off on Monday, 1 March 2010, making the country completely serviced by digital signal. However, analog cable is still used by many cable subscribers, so therefore a cable switchover is unlikely to happen in the near future. * : Bulgaria launched a free-to-air platform in the Sofia region, starting in November 2004. The Communications Regulatory Commission (CRC) has said that it received 6 bids for the licence to build and operate Bulgaria's two nationwide DTT networks. A second licence tender for the operation of 3 DTT multiplexes was open until 27 May 2009.

Analog closedown warning broadcast in Finland. * ceased analog terrestrial transmissions nationwide at 04:00, Saturday, 1 September 2007 (the switch-off was previously planned for midnight but a few extra hours were added for technical reasons). This was controversial, as the cost of a digital TV set in Finland at the time was heavily criticised and saw a substantial decrease in how much the television license cost. Cable TV viewers continued to receive analog broadcasts until the end of February 2008. * switched off all analog services (terrestrial, satellite and cable) on Tuesday, 29 November 2011.

It started in Sardinia on Wednesday 15 October 2008, and was completed on Wednesday 4 July 2012, when the last analog transmitters in the Province of Palermo were shut down. The switchover was politically controversial due to a 2004 law that seemed to favor Mediaset, owned by the Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, in the television market. A 2006 bill proposed by Paolo Gentiloni passed the government of Romano Prodi that would make one of Mediaset's channels as well as one from public broadcaster RAI move to digital three years before the switch. The bill was called \\"tailored for political revenge\\" by Berlusconi. In 2011 the European Court of Justice ruled that the digital switchover in Italy was illegally subsidised favoring Berlusconi's media group.

The switch-off was noticed by few, since the overwhelming majority receive TV via cable and only around 74,000 households relied on terrestrial over-the-air broadcasts. The switch-off was helped greatly as cable continued to use analog distribution, and thus consumers' old tuners continued to be useful. In March 2018, major cable provider Ziggo has announced that it will gradually phase out analogue cable TV transmissions in the next two years. Analogue satellite transmissions from Astra 19.2¬∞E were halted on 18 August 1996, just two months after digital was introduced.

Regional television broadcasters also began converting to digital. Analog terrestrial television is planned to be shut down nationalwide before March 31, 2021. No deadline for cable television switchover was set, although a recent study shows that the coverage of digital cable television in all cable television users in China reaches 92% in Q1 2020, an all-time high. * : The original digital switchover plan from PAL to DTMB was supposed to take place in 2012. After being postponed multiple times, analogue broadcasting will officially end from 30 November 2020 at 23:59 HKT, when all analogue transmissions will turn off. A total of 160,000 lower-income households are also to receive subsidies from the government to buy digital television sets or a set-top box to get a digital signal following the transition. * : Telecom Regulatory Authority of India has set the deadlines for the completion of Phase I (Metro cities) by 31 December 2019; which is already completed, Phase II (cities having a population of more than one million) by 31 December 2021, and Phase III (the rest of India) by 31 December 2023. * : Digital television transition took place in 2 stages. The first phase of simulcast started in January 2020 in 12 provinces, and later in 22 provinces in March 2020. Analogue broadcasting will officially and completely turn off at 2022 Indonesian National Broadcast Day or 1 April 2022. Digital terrestrial television was launched on 21 December 2010 (DVB-T) and 20 November 2013 (DVB-T2). Then on an unknown date the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology (KOMINFO) announced 1 September 2025 is the new analogue cable shutoff date. * : First digital television broadcasting were commenced in 2009, using the DVB-T MPEG-4 standard, with 40% of population having access to digital TV by mid-2011. There is no deadline yet for converting analog signals to digital. * : DVB-T/T2 DTT is operating, including in the Kurdistan Region. No analog switchover date yet.https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=090000168078352e * : Is in transition to digital as of 2019. No completion date yet. * : The shutdown of analog broadcasting began on 1 December 2018, the first two regions turned off: Jambyl and Mangystau Regions, On 1 July 2019, Nine more regions were disconnected: South Kazakhstan, Atyrau, Kyzylorda, Almaty Regions, East Kazakhstan, Pavlodar, North Kazakhstan, Kostanay and Karaganda Regions. And on 1 July 2021 (the final stage), the last five regions will be disconnected: West Kazakhstan, Akmola, Aktobe Regions, Nur-Sultan and Almaty. * : Is in transition to DVB-T2, stewarded by GatesAir. Phase 2 of the DTT rollout was finished by May 2017. No analog switch off date yet. * : Adopted the DTMB standard as Mainland China and Hong Kong in 2008. Analog broadcasting will officially end in 2020 at 00:00 MOT when all analog broadcasts and analog transmitters will be turned off. *: Digital broadcasts launched in 2013. The switchover date has been set to be December 2020. * : Digital terrestrial broadcasts launched in 2018. That same year, analog cable television was shut in the capital Kathmandu. * : The process started in 2012 with the deployment of a DVB-T2 system. No completion date yet. * : In June 2010, the National Telecommunications Commission set a deadline of 11:59 p.m. on 31 December 2015 for the discontinuation of analog television. However, since the last quarter of 2014, the digitization deadline has been postponed to 2019 and should be expected that all analog broadcasts will be shut off in 2023. ZOE Broadcasting Network's DZOZ-TV became the first station in the country to permanently cease analog terrestrial operations on 28 February 2017, signaling the start of the country's transition to digital-only broadcasting. Digital television in the Philippines uses the Japanese ISDB standards for its terrestrial broadcast. * : The country launched DVB-T tests in 2002 and it was rolled out nationwide in 2005. On 27 December 2011, Prime Minister Nguy·ªÖn T·∫•n D≈©ng issued Decree No. 2451/QD-TTg approving the country television project of \\"Digitalisation of terrestrial television transmission and broadcasting in 2020\\" (also called as the Project of Digitalisation of Television) which prescribes that before 31 December 2020, analogue television broadcasting in 63 Vietnam provinces and cities will be switched to digital terrestrial television under the DVB-T2 system. Analogue signals first switched-off on 1 November 2015 and complete migration into digital television is scheduled to take place on 30 November 2020 before a final analogue shutdown being announced the following month by the country Prime Minister on 31 December. Since January 2020, a total of 1.3 million digital television receivers for both poor and near poor households has been provided directly by Vietnam's public utility telecommunications service provision of the Ministry of Information and Communications in 48 provinces and cities under the television digitalisation programme of the central government. By 30 June, a total of 21 provinces had indefinitely stop broadcasting analogue and migrate into digital broadcasting. =Europe= * : In February 2018, the DTT service rolled out. No completion date yet. * : All privately owned networks' analog broadcasts were switched off on 1 August 2018 in the Kiev region, on 1 September 2018 in most parts of the country. The channels of UA:PBC were switched off in September 2018 - January 2019 in most parts of the country. Meanwhile, most channels at Russia-bordering regions, and some local channels (nationwide) that didn't yet get the license for digital broadcasting, will still broadcast in analog until 31 December 2020, after which they will be discontinuing analog broadcasts. However, in some areas, there are commercial channels staying in analog. =Oceania= * Introduced its digital terrestrial service called Walesi in testing phase 2016 and rolled out to public in December 2017.

According to David Rehr, then president and CEO of the National Association of Broadcasters, this transition represented \\"the most significant advancement of television technology since color TV was introduced.\\" For full- power TV stations, the transition went into effect on June 12, 2009, with stations ending regular programming on their analog signals no later than 11:59 p.m. local time that day. Under the Digital Transition and Public Safety Act of 2005, full-power broadcasting of analog television in the United States was initially planned to have ceased after February 17, 2009. To help U.S. consumers through the conversion, the Act also established a federally sponsored DTV Converter Box Coupon Program. The DTV Delay Act changed the mandatory analog cutoff date to June 12, although stations were permitted to cease analog transmissions before the new mandatory cutoff date. The legislation was enacted on February 4, 2009, and on February 11, 2009, President Barack Obama signed it into law. The purpose of the extension was to help the millions of households who had not been able to get their coupons for converters because demand for coupons exceeded the funding provided for in the initial bill, leaving millions on a waiting list to receive coupons. Funding for extra coupons was provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. By midnight on the original cut-off date of February 17, 2009, 641 stations representing 36 percent of U.S. full-power broadcasters were transmitting exclusively in digital. Analog broadcasting did not cease entirely following the June 12 deadline: under the provisions of the Short- term Analog Flash and Emergency Readiness Act, approximately 120 full-power stations briefly maintained analog \\"nightlight\\" service, ending no later than July 12.FCC list of \\"nightlight\\" stations In a separate category, low power television stations were permitted to continue analog broadcasts for several more years. On July 15, 2011, the FCC posted the required transition deadlines for low power television. Stations broadcasting on channels 52 to 69 were required to vacate those channels by December 31, 2011, and all analog television transmitters (primarily low-powered (LP), and Class-A low-powered (-CA) stations, and also broadcast translator (TX) repeaters in rural communities) were required to shut down by September 1, 2015. On April 24, 2015, it was announced that the conversion date for standard LPTVs and translators still broadcasting in analog had been suspended until further notice, due to economic problems that might have arisen from the then-upcoming spectrum auction; however, Class A low-powered stations were still required to convert by the original deadline date of September 1, 2015.FCC Public Notice: \\"SUSPENSION OF SEPTEMBER 1, 2015 DIGITAL TRANSITION DATE FOR LOW POWER TELEVISION AND TV TRANSLATOR STATIONS\\", April 24, 2015. After the auction's completion in 2017, the FCC announced on May 17 of that year that all analog low-power stations and transmitters must convert by July 13, 2021.FCC Public Notice: \\"The incentive auction task force and media bureau announce procedures for low power television, television translator and replacement translator stations during the post-incentive auction transition\\", May 17, 2017 Congressional mandate The Congressional deadline to transition to digital broadcasts was pushed back several times. Congress passed the Telecommunications Act of 1996 with the original transition date of December 31, 2006. However, the transition to digital television was set back three times: first to December 31, 2008, then to February 17, 2009, and then finally to June 12, 2009. All U.S. full-power analog TV broadcasts were required by law to end on June 12, 2009.Section 3002 of the Digital Transition and Public Safety Act of 2005 amending the Communications Act of 1934, section 309(j)(14), codified at . Since March 1, 2007, all new television devices that receive signals over-the-air, including pocket-sized portable televisions, personal computer video capture card tuners, and DVD recorders, have been required to include digital ATSC tuners. Prior to this, the requirement was phased-in starting with larger screen sizes. Until the transition was completed, most U.S. broadcasters transmitted their signals in both analog and digital formats, though a few were already digital-only. Digital stations transmitted on another channel, which was assigned to each full-power broadcaster in a three-round digital channel election. The transition from the analog NTSC format to the digital ATSC format was originally required to be completed on February 17, 2009, as set by Congress in the Digital Transition and Public Safety Act of 2005. Following the analog switch-off, the FCC reallocated channels 52 through 69 (the 700 MHz band) for other communications traffic, completing the reallocation of broadcast channels 52‚Äì69 that began in the late 1990s. These channels were auctioned off in early 2008, with the winning bidders taking possession of them in June 2009. Four channels from this portion of the broadcast spectrum (60, 61, 68, and 69) were held for reallocation to public safety communications (such as police, fire, and emergency rescue). Some of the remaining freed up frequencies will be used for advanced commercial wireless services for consumers, such as Qualcomm's planned use of former UHF channel 55 for its MediaFLO service. For U.S. cable television, the FCC voted 5‚Äì0 on September 12, 2007 to require operators to make local broadcasts available to their users in analog. This requirement lasts until 2012, when the FCC will review the case again. This was necessary since many cable companies, including major ones like Comcast, have been taking analog channels away from customers. In 2007, a bill in the U.S. Congress called the DTV Border Fix Act was introduced. It would have allowed all television stations within 80 kilometers (50 miles) of the Mexican border, in areas such as San Diego and the Rio Grande Valley, to keep their analog signals active for another five years. The bill passed the Senate but did not pass the House.Bill S.2507 (2007), \\"DTV Border Fix Act of 2007\\" from OpenCongress.org The SAFER Act was passed by Congress and signed by President Bush in December 2008. The act has been called the \\"analog nightlight\\" act, and allows analog stations on channels that did not conflict with post- transition digital stations the option of leaving their analog transmitters on for an additional 30 days, but only to provide disaster information and information regarding the digital transition. Due to a lack of Commerce Department funds to provide for additional converter box coupons, and on account of other potential problems, the Barack Obama transition team asked Congress in a January 8, 2009, letter to delay the end of analog TV. Gene Kimmelman of Consumers Union, which wanted a delay, feared older people, those outside cities and the poor needed help. Speaking to a group of area residents as part of a nationwide campaign to persuade people to upgrade, FCC chair Kevin Martin said in Raleigh, North Carolina that a delay was \\"unlikely,\\" and that it would be \\"unfair\\" to all those who made the effort to switch, and to those who bought the reallocated spectrum that was sold with the understanding analog broadcasts would end February 17, 2009. The delay passed Congress despite this prediction (see Extension of transition to June 12). Transition testing=Wilmington, North Carolina test market= As part of a test by the FCC to iron out transition and reception concerns before the nationwide shutoff, all of the major commercial network stations in the Wilmington, North Carolina market ceased transmission of their analog signals on September 8, 2008, making it the first market in the nation to go digital-only. Wilmington was chosen as the test city in part because the area's digital channel positions would remain unchanged after the transition. Wilmington was also appropriate because it had no hills to cause reception problems and all of the stations would have UHF channels. The low-power CBS affiliate WILM-LD signed on its new digital signal in time for the transition. The test excluded UNC- TV/PBS station WUNJ, which kept their analog signal on, as they were the official conduit of emergency information in the area.StarNewsOnline.com  Star-News  Wilmington, NC Viewers were notified of the change by months of public service announcements, town hall meetings, and local news coverage. Only 7% of viewers were affected by the loss of analog broadcasts, the remainder subscribing to cable or satellite services, but this produced 1,800 calls to the FCC for assistance. Officials were concerned by the implications of this for larger markets or those where reliance on over the air broadcasts exceeds 30%. More disturbingly, while many calls from viewers were straightforward questions about installation of antennas and converters, or the need to scan for channels before being able to watch digital television, hundreds more were from viewers who had installed converters and UHF antennas correctly but had still lost existing channels. Most affected were full-power broadcasters which had been on low-VHF channels. WECT (NBC 6 Wilmington), a signal which in its analog form reached to the edge of Myrtle Beach, could no longer be received by many who had watched the station for years‚Äì a victim of a move to UHF 44 at a different transmitter site. WECT's coverage area had been substantially reduced; for many who were on the fringes of the analog NBC 6 signal, WECT was no more.FCC OKs digital workaround for DTV signal range problems, Matthew Lasar, ArsTechnica, November 11, 2008 However weeks before, new digital-only WMBF-TV, a new NBC affiliate, came to the air to serve Myrtle Beach with a city-grade signal; like WECT, WMBF was owned by Raycom Media at the time. On November 7, 2008, the FCC issued an order allowing distributed transmission systems to be constructed by stations which otherwise cannot cover their original analog footprint with their new digital channels and facilities.FCC order on distributed transmission, November 2008 While broadcasters may now apply for DTS facilities, this decision was made far too late to allow the extra transmitter sites to be constructed and operational before the original February 17, 2009 analog shutoff.Home Theater News: FCC Green-Lights DTV Range Fix, Mark Fleischmann, November 17, 2008  Impact  Digital TV encoding allows stations to offer higher definition video and better sound quality than analog, as well as allowing the option of programming multiple digital subchannels (multicasting). However, it provides these advantages at the cost of a severe limitation of broadcast range. Digital signals do not have 'grade b' signal areas, and are either 'in perfectly' or 'not in at all'. Further, since most stations have elected to use UHF rather than older VHF channel allocations, their actual broadcast range is far less than previously. Viewers in major metropolitan areas will likely not notice problems; however, rural TV users have generally had most and in some events all of the stations they previously received with acceptable but not 'perfect' signals fall over the digital cliff (as the loss of signal has been described). Lastly, many low-power broadcasters have been temporarily permitted to transmit in analog for several years.What is Digital Television? for the public, by DTV Answers. Accessed May 11, 2007. =Consumer awareness= Although Britain spent the equivalent of more than a billion dollars educating about 60 million people, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration had received $5 million a year before the original transition date of February 17, 2009, and the FCC had received $2.5 million and was scheduled to receive $20 million more later in the year, for 300 million people. This meant voluntary education campaigns would be needed. It was also noted that low-income, elderly, disabled, inner city, immigrants, and rural Americans were targeted the most, because these groups mainly watch analog antenna TV more than any other groups.Digital Television Transition: Implementation of the Converter Box Subsidy Program Is Under Way, but Preparedness to Manage an Increase in Subsidy Demand Is Unclear United States Government Accountability Office September 16, 2008 While broadcasters were forced by Federal Communications Commission regulations to devote the equivalent of more than a billion dollars worth of airtime to public service announcements regarding the digital transition, the amount of information conveyed in these short advertisements was by necessity limited. Both the on- air announcements and government-funded telephone hotlines receiving viewer inquiries directed consumers to Internet sites to seek information,Teletech DTV hotline less than helpful, former employee says, Rachel Abell, KVIA-TV ABC 7 El Paso, Texas, February 2009 a problematic approach, as many of those most- affected do not use online media as a primary source of information. =Obsolete equipment= Consumers' old analog televisions, VCRs, DVRs, and other devices which lack a digital tuner no longer receive over-the-air television, though previously recorded content can still be replayed. The only real solution to this is to buy an external tuner (called a converter box) that receives DTV signals directly and converts them to analog for the television VCR or other analog device. Users of analog VCRs, DVRs, or other recording devices which lack a digital tuner have a unique problem of no longer being able to record programs across multiple channels. In order to make them work with DTV the viewer must use an external tuner box and set the device to record the output from that box, typically L-1 for the line input. Some manufacturers such as Zinwell and Dish sell external converter boxes/tuners that will automatically change channels at preset times. The analog VCR or DVR may record at preset times but will continue recording the L-1 line input, which will be the same channel unless the channel is manually changed. Alternatively the user may purchase a new TV, DVR, or DVD recorder with a built-in digital tuner. However, these newer technologies have their own drawbacks, such as no way to store programs long-term (DVR) or being limited to only 1‚Äì2 hours with high quality XP mode (DVD-R). =Loss of service= A major concern is that the broadcast technology used for ATSC signals called 8VSB has problems receiving signals inside buildings and in urban areas, largely due to multipath reception issues which cause ghosting and fading on analog images, but can lead to intermittent signal or no reception at all on ATSC programs. DTV broadcasts exhibit a digital cliff effect, by which viewers will receive either a perfect signal or no signal at all with little or no middle ground. Digital transmissions do contain additional data bits to provide error correction for a finite number of bit errors; once signal quality degrades beyond that point, recovery of the original digital signal becomes impossible, and the image on the screen freezes, or blinks back and forth to totally blank black. The maximum power for DTV broadcast classes is also substantially lower; one-fifth of the legal limits for the former full-power analog services. This is because there are only eight different states in which an 8VSB signal can be in at any one moment; thus, like all digital transmissions, very little signal is required at the receiver in order to decode it. Nonetheless, this limit is often too low for many stations to reach many rural areas, which was an alleged benefit in the FCC's choice of ATSC and 8VSB over worldwide-standard DVB-T and its COFDM modulation. Additionally, without the hierarchical modulation of DVB, signal loss is complete, and there is no switch to a lower resolution before this occurs. A hundred-kW analog station on TV channels 2 to 6 would therefore be faced with the choice of either lowering its power by 80% (to the twenty kilowatt limit of low-VHF DTV) or abandoning a frequency which it occupied since the 1950s in order to transmit more power (up to 1000 kW) on the less- crowded UHF TV band. Such stations can keep the same channel number, however, because of ATSC virtual channels. Unfortunately, the higher frequencies are challenged in areas where signals must travel great distances or encounter significant terrestrial obstacles. Most stations in the low-VHF (channels 2‚Äì6) did not return to these frequencies after the transition. About 40 stations remained in the low-VHF after the transition, with the majority in smaller markets (with a few notable exceptions).How Well Does High VHF Work for DTV? TV Technology April 9, 2008 (Retrieved on January 1, 2009) The FCC has long discouraged the digital allocation on low-VHF channels for several reasons: higher ambient noise, interference with FM radio (channel 6 borders FM at 88 MHz), and larger antenna size required for these channels.Seventh Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking Federal Communications Commission October 20, 2006 (Retrieved on January 29, 2009) After the transition, many viewers using \\"high-definition\\" antennas have reported problems receiving stations that broadcast on VHF channels. This is because some of the new antennas marketed as \\"HDTV antennas\\" from manufacturers such as Channel Master were only designed for channels 7‚Äì51 and are more compact than their channel 2‚Äì69 counterparts. These manufacturers did not anticipate widespread continued use of the relatively longer wavelength low-VHF channels. Stations that broadcast in analog on channel 6 have had an additional benefit of having its audio feed broadcast on 87.7 MHz, which is at the very low end of the FM radio dial. As such, many stations that use channel 6 have taken advantage of this, and directly promote this feature, especially during drive time newscasts, and as a critical conduit of information in markets where severe weather (such as hurricanes) allowed a station the advantage to broadcast their audio via FM radio without having to contract with another FM operation to do so. WDSU in New Orleans, Miami's WTVJ and WECT in Wilmington, North Carolina were among the most well-known Channel 6 broadcasters which used this approach to provide emergency information during hurricanes. Digital television, however, does not have this feature, and after the transition, this additional method of reception is no longer available. WRGB, channel 6 in Albany, New York, used a separate transmitter on 87.7 that transmitted a vertically polarized analog audio signal, which would theoretically avoid interference with the horizontally polarized digital TV signal. This would allow the station to keep its audio on 87.7 FM after the transition to digital.\\"The Mystique of Channel 6\\" , tvtechnology.com, February 26, 2009 WRGB ran this transmitter for approximately 6 weeks on an experimental basis, only to find that the vertically polarized 87.7 MHz signal interfered with the digital video, while broadcast of analog signals on 87.9 MHz met with FCC objections. WITI in Milwaukee took a more direct though still experimental approach to restore their TV audio, having it restored in August 2009 to an HD Radio subchannel of WMIL-FM via a content agreement with WMIL owner Clear Channel Communications. A purchase of HD Radio equipment or having a car stereo equipped with an HD Radio receiver is required to listen to this broadcast. An outdoor high-gain antenna was assumed in planning for DTV reception. Planning for DTV reception assumed \\"a properly oriented, high-gain antenna mounted 30 feet in the air outside.\\" The Consumer Electronics Association set up a website called AntennaWeb to identify means to provide the correct signal reception to over- the-air viewers. Another website, TVFool provides geographic mapping and signal data to allow viewers to estimate the number of channels which will be gained or lost as a result of digital transition; while it estimated that marginally more stations would be gained than lost by viewers, this varied widely with viewers of low-VHF analog signals in distant-fringe areas among the most adversely affected. An estimated 1.8 million people were expected to lose the ability to access over-the-air TV entirely as a result of the digital transition. Viewers in rural and mountainous regions were particularly prone to lose all reception after digital transition.Digital Transition May Leave Some Without Signal , WMUR 9 New Hampshire, February 18, 2009 =Problems= U.S. markets which have presented unique problems for digital transition include: * New York City-Newark was one of the early U.S. terrestrial digital television pioneers with state-of-the-art ATSC facilities installed atop the World Trade Center as early as 1998, but those facilities were destroyed in the September 11 attacks, and for a number of years, New York lacked one single point of sufficient height from which to cover the entire region without severe multipath interference issues in downtown Manhattan. The 1776-foot 1 World Trade Center, proposed to replace the former World Trade Center, would not be completed for some time, so several scenarios were considered to enhance service. One such system, called distributed transmission, was being funded by a $30,000,000 federal grant to assure that no viewers are left without service. The DTS would have used low power transmitters to fill gaps in coverage from the Empire State Building. The Metropolitan Television Alliance, a group of eleven New York and New Jersey broadcasters organized soon after the destruction of the facilities at the World Trade Center, has been leading the development of the DTS system. In 2004, a partial solution was implemented: the top of the Cond√© Nast Building at 4 Times Square was reinforced and installed with a massive multiplexed UHF antenna. This relieves overcrowding at Empire State by using the site of a local Clear Channel radio facility to replace master antenna installations destroyed at WTC. * New Orleans and portions of Mississippi were operating some digital transmitters from temporary locations or from towers belonging to other stations due to damage done during Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita in 2005. While stations are now back on-air, the coverage area often does not match that specified on the station licenses due to the change in antenna locations. * Denver faces unique multipath interference problems largely due to its mountainous location; its antennas on Lookout Mountain will need to increase in height to overcome obstacles to digital reception, but attempts to get local zoning approval have met with strong opposition. Federal legislation was ultimately used to require that Denver stations be allowed to construct their post-transition digital facilities but sharp nulls and gaps in coverage remain. * Sparsely populated mountainous regions such as Montana and Utah currently rely heavily on broadcast translators to rebroadcast network stations into underserved communities; while these low-power retransmitters are not themselves required to broadcast digitally, many will need costly upgrades to receive a digital signal from the originating station‚Äîif the signal can be received at all. 23% of the 4000 licensed translators have received a federal subsidyMany rural TVs will go dark, not digital, David Migoya, Denver Post, February 10, 2009 to make the conversion,Low-power rural stations will continue in analog for several more years ‚Ä¢ RICHARD ECKE ‚Ä¢ Great Falls (Montana) Tribune ‚Ä¢ February 1, 2009 but many others will simply go dark. In sparsely populated markets such as Glendive, Montana, translators are needed to reach a widely scattered audience but the readiness of many small municipally owned translators remains largely unknown. * Many other stations in the Rocky Mountains had chosen to end analog broadcasts early because of poor winter conditions at transmission sites in February; stations needed to be sure they can make the on-site adjustments. For these broadcasters, the DTV Delay Act and its extended deadline of June 12, 2009 came too late to be of use, as the digital transition has already been completed. * Vermont, a market in which all major stations are as of February 2009 digital-only, is problematic as both a rural state and a mountainous region. WCAX CBS 3 in Burlington, and WPTZ NBC 5 in Plattsburgh, New York are now both UHF broadcasts from Mount Mansfield, causing many viewers to lose the stations. Previously as analog VHF stations, WCAX transmitted from Mount Mansfield, while WPTZ was broadcast from Terry Mountain in Peru, New York, on the opposite shore of Lake Champlain. * Buffalo, New York, a city whose stations mostly broadcast from among the Boston Hills and cover a fairly rugged terrain along the Appalachian Plateau, is one of several markets in which the primary stations are VHF stations that operate on 2, 4, and 7. All three stations were assigned DTV channels in the UHF spectrum; all had lost significant broadcast coverage in the transition, and viewers in the western Twin Tiers region lost all of their broadcast stations. In May 2009, both WIVB (channel 4) and WGRZ (channel 2) warned its viewers that were not in Erie or Niagara Counties that they would likely lose the broadcast signal, reducing the station's coverage area from approximately 12 counties to just two, along with several parts of southern Ontario, a critical viewing audience for all Buffalo stations. * Syracuse, New York had since 1948 employed low-VHF channels to feed networks to adjacent markets (notably CBS to the northern two thirds of the Utica market and NBC to the southern half of the Watertown market). These markets are 60 to 75 miles (100 to 125 km) distant. Utica lost CBS service because its affiliate, based in Syracuse, broadcasts on channel 5 analog (with a signal strong enough to reach Utica), but its channel 47 digital signal does not reach anywhere near Utica. Channel 5 had historically refused to cede its Utica territory to another potential affiliate, but in October 2015, CBS signed an affiliation deal with NBC affiliate WKTV, which restored CBS service to the Utica market via its second digital subchannel (prior to this, Binghamton affiliate WBNG-TV (channel 12) had served the southern third of the Utica market, which corresponds to the Cooperstown area). Similarly, Watertown, New York and Kingston, Ontario lost Syracuse NBC affiliate WSTM-TV once the DTV transition rendered Syracuse a UHF island; WSTM-TV continues to be shown on local cable systems. Like CBS in Utica, NBC eventually restored service to the Watertown market, signing an affiliation deal with new sign-on WVNC-LD in November 2016.Cogeco to replace channels:Syracuse feeds to be lost , MIKE KOREEN, Kingston Whig-Standard, January 2009 * On January 15, 2009, Hawaii became the first state in the United States to have its television stations switch from analog to digital early. Existing analog facilities at Mount Haleakala on Maui are to be removed due to ongoing radio interference with astronomy equipment operated under the watchful eye of the United States Department of Defense and the University of Hawaii. The digital stations are being deployed using new facilities at Ulupalakua and the old towers will be removed before bird nesting season begins in March. By making the switch early, the broadcast towers atop Haleakala near the birds' nesting grounds can be dismantled without interfering with the Hawaiian petrels' nesting season. *Between June 12 and July 1, 2009, programs on the Fox network were unavailable to viewers throughout the state of Montana (except viewers in the Billings area) who do not have cable or satellite service.Missoula Fox Affiliate Doesn't Go Digital ‚Äì at Least Not YetToday's Digital Upgrade Will Leave Some in Area without Fox for a While, Richard Ecke, Great Falls Tribune, June 12, 2009. The stations in Butte, Great Falls and Missoula were among many full-powered stations owned by Equity Broadcasting. Equity filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2008, and the stations went silent on June 12 due to inability to fund construction of digital facilities. Unlike most established broadcasters, Equity had expanded rapidly using outlying UHF stations as satellite-fed repeaters. Many but not all were low-power TV stations, typically carrying Univisi√≥n or smaller networks such as WB/UPN (later The CW) and MyTV. The majority of Equity's full-power operations came to the air after 1997, by which time the digital transition was already in progress. The stations were therefore not allocated a second, digital companion channel and were not required to simulcast digitally until their required flash-cut to digital signals at the end of transition. Although Equity conducted a successful auction for the stations in April 2009, the required federal government approval came too late for the new owner, Max Media, to do the flash cuts. Eventually, Max Media chose to move the affiliation to digital subchannels of their respective new sister stations, all ABC affiliates. Other stations formerly owned by Equity, such as KUOK in Oklahoma City, were able to make flash-cuts under new ownership and are still on the air. Many stations were sold at auction to Daystar Television Network, which will construct the digital facilities and air religious programming on the acquired stations; in some cases these went silent, returning to operation after slightly less than a year off-air in order to avoid losing the full-service licenses. At least one affected station, WNGS Buffalo (now WBBZ-TV), had been subsequently resold while silent. (In all, the FCC signed on 136 full-power stations after the original allocation of digital signals.) Except for the full-service Equity stations, almost all were able to flash-cut by the deadline. Notable exceptions were Pappas-owned KCWK (which went silent several months before digital transition was originally to be completed and never returned; KCWK's license was cancelled by the FCC on June 2, 2009) and WWAZ-TV (which returned in August 2012 to the air). There are 80 media markets in which more than 100,000 households receive television signals by over-the-air broadcasts. =Frequency reallocation= The reclaimed channels were to be used for a variety of mobile services, including mobile phones, the now-defunct MediaFLO (55), and public safety (63/64 base, 68/69 mobile). Most of this mobile spectrum has been sold to existing incumbent providers, with AT&T; Mobility and Verizon as the largest bidders (see United States 2008 wireless spectrum auction). The elimination of UHF channels, rather than VHF channels as in the rest of the world, precludes the use of band III (high VHF) for Digital Audio Broadcasting as is used in a few other countries. It also makes more difficult the reassignment of channels 5 and 6 (76 to 88 MHz) to expand the FM radio broadcast band.Could EXB Band Be Your New Home? RadioWorld September 10, 2008 There are also no channels set aside for analog broadcasts of the Emergency Alert System, rendering most portable emergency TV sets useless. While a small number of portable ATSC sets have started to appear, these are costly.Portable Digital TVs Have Promise, But Need Work, Chicago Tribune, January 28, 2009 A portable converter box (such as Winegard's RCDT09A) would require a bulky external battery and mobile ATSC is not yet available. Another option to people would be getting a USB-based TV tuner card for their laptop computer, which in addition to its low costs became a popular option after Microsoft released Windows 7 four months after the DTV transition ended. A Google- sponsored program called Free the Airwaves sought to use the \\"empty\\" white space within the remaining TV for unlicensed use, like for Wi-Fi.Free The Airwaves.com / In March 2008, the FCC requested public comment on turning the bandwidth currently occupied by analog television channels 5 and 6 (76‚Äì88 MHz) over to extending the FM broadcast band when the digital television transition was to be completed in February 2009 (ultimately delayed to June 2009). , 28403 This proposed allocation would effectively assign frequencies corresponding to the existing Japanese FM radio service (which begins at 76 MHz) for use as an extension to the existing North American FM broadcast band. On August 22, 2011, the United States' Federal Communications Commission announced a freeze on all future applications for broadcast stations requesting to use channel 51,FCC Public Notice DA-11-1428A1: * Rcd PDF * Microsoft Word document * PDF format * Plain Text format to prevent adjacent- channel interference (ACI) to the A-Block of the 700 MHz band. Later that year (on December 16, 2011), Industry Canada and the CRTC followed suit in placing a moratorium on future television stations using Channel 51 for broadcast use, to prevent ACI to the A-Block of the 700 MHz band.Industry Canada Advisory Letter - Moratorium on the Use of Television Channel 51 Digital-to-analog converters Now that the switch from analog to digital broadcasts is complete, analog TVs are incapable of receiving over-the-air broadcasts without the addition of a set-top converter box. Consequently, a digital-to- analog converter, an electronic device that connects to an analog television, must be used in order to allow the television to receive digital broadcasts.A television commercial shown on American television featuring This Old House announces that this is true. The box may also be called a \\"set-top\\" converter, \\"digital TV adapter\\" (DTA), or \\"digital set-top box\\" (DSTB). =Coupon program= bank card which cannot be used for anything except for a converter box purchase. left To assist consumers through the conversion, the Department of Commerce through its National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) division handled requests from households for up to two $40 coupons for digital-to-analog converter boxes beginning January 1, 2008 via a toll free number or a website.Official Digital Transition website National Telecommunications & Information Administration The program was paid for with a small part of the $20 billion taken in from the DTV spectrum auction. However, these government coupons were limited to an initial sum of $890 million (22,250,000 coupons) with the option to grow to $1.34 billion (33,500,000 coupons), which is far short of the estimated 112 million households (224 million redeemable coupons) in the United States. Nevertheless, not every household took advantage of the offer, as reports indicate half of all households already had at least one digital TV. In January 2009, the NTIA began placing coupon requests on a waiting list after the program reached its maximum allowed funding. New requests for coupons were fulfilled only after unredeemed coupons expired. These coupons could be redeemed toward the purchase of a digital-to-analog converter at brick and mortar, on-line, and telephone retailers that had completed the NTIA certification process. Retail prices for the boxes range from $40 to $70 (plus tax and/or shipping); after applying the coupons, the price to the consumer would be between $5 and $40 per box. Because it was actually used as a payment, despite the name \\"coupon\\", consumers paid pay state and local sales tax on the coupon amount, which in effect reduced its value by about $3 (based on 7¬Ω% tax). There has been possible evidence that the presence of the government coupon program has inflated the prices of converter boxes by between $21 and $34 above what they would be otherwise.DTV coupon program mainly benefits retailers, not consumers , by Scott J. Wallsten, September 16, 2008These converter boxes requires royalties to be paid to license the MPEG-2 and ATSC patents, which may contribute (for example, the royalties for ATSC was $5 per receiver according to https://www.mpegla.com/wp- content/uploads/atscweb.pdf). Extension of transition to June 12=DTV Delay Act= On January 21, 2009, Senator Jay Rockefeller introduced a bill in the Senate titled the DTV Delay Act because millions of Americans would not be ready for the cutoff on February 17 due to a shortage of converter box coupons, and planning that the transition date be moved to June 12. Rockefeller, chairman of the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, and Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, worked together on the bill. Hutchison supported the idea because Rockefeller did not intend to ask for another postponement. On January 22, The Nielsen Company said 6.5 million Americans had not prepared for the switch. Opponents pointed out that TV stations would face extra operating expenses, and those who paid to use the spectrum to be made available would have to wait. Under later amendments, stations could choose to end analog broadcasts before June 12 even if the bill passed, and any frequencies freed up by such action could be used by fire and police departments and other emergency services. Those whose converter box coupons had expired would be allowed to apply for new coupons. The House postponed a similar bill (by House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Henry Waxman), until the Senate's version was complete.Broadcasting and Cable January 28, 2009 ‚Äì DTV Delay Bill Fails To Pass In House The Senate unanimously voted on January 26, 2009 to delay the digital TV transition to June 12, 2009. However, the House of Representatives voted on and defeated a similar measure on January 28. Rep. Joe Barton led the movement in the House to defeat the measure, saying that \\"the DTV transition is neither stuck nor broke\\", and that any problems with the DTV transition can be fixed. Barton also said, \\"I guarantee you, no matter when you set the date‚Äî February 17, June 12, July the Fourth, Valentine's Day‚Äî there are going to be some people that aren't ready.\\"Digital TV Transition Delay: House Defeats Bill, February 17 Deadline Intact, Huffington Post, January 28, 2009 On January 29, the DTV Delay Act passed in the Senate.DTV Delay Act (Senate version), Retrieved on February 5, 2009.

On February 9, President Obama posted the bill on whitehouse.gov, giving the public five days to weigh in on it. Under a midnight February 10 deadline imposed by the FCC, broadcasters disclosed whether they would still cease broadcasting analog signals on the original date of February 17, or if they would delay until June 12, should the DTV Delay Act be signed into law. On February 10, the FCC published the list. 491 stations stated they intended to transition on February 17.

It was believed Albuquerque, Santa Fe, Austin and Dallas would be the least prepared markets, but this turned out not to be the case, as most of the difficulties were in the Northeast, primarily with stations that changed their digital frequencies from UHF to VHF. On June 13, 2009, the FCC said their help line, with about 4000 answering phones, received 317,450 calls on June 12. About one-third of callers still needed converter boxes, and one-fifth had reception problems. Acting FCC chair Michael Copps said, \\"Our job is far from over. This transition is not a one-day affair.\\" In New York City, about 11,000 people called the FCC for assistance, the most of any market. The other areas from which the most calls to the FCC were made: Chicago (6526), Los Angeles (5473), Dallas-Fort Worth (5473), and Philadelphia (3749). 900,000 calls were received in all. The National Association of Broadcasters said 278 TV stations received 35,500 calls, but most callers merely needed to rescan. The Commerce Department said 319,900 requested converter box coupons on June 11, almost four times the average during the previous month. SmithGeiger LLC said 2.2 million homes were not ready, while Nielsen said the number was 2.8 million. This included homes which had requested coupons. On June 14, Nielsen said the number was 2.5 million, or 2.2 percent of homes. That number was down to 2.1 million, or 1.8 percent, by June 21, and 1.7 million, or 1.5 percent, a week later. One month after the transition, the number was 1.5 million, 1.3 percent, and after nearly 2 months, the number was down to just over one million, or 1.1 percent. As of August 30, 2009, the number was 710,000, as 572,000 had upgraded in August and 1.8 million since June 12. In some cases where digital frequencies moved, people have been advised not only to re-scan but to \\"double-scan\\", in order to clear outdated information from the digital TV or converter box memory. Calls to the FCC decreased from 43,000 a day in the week ending June 15 to 21,000 the next week. Reception problems, representing nearly a third of calls at first, were down to one-fifth. On June 15, 2009, U.S. Representative Peter DeFazio, an Oregon Democrat, introduced the House version of The Digital TV Transition Fairness Act, which Senator Bernie Sanders introduced in December 2008. It would require video service providers to offer a $10 basic package to anyone who lost at least one channel to the DTV conversion (with broadcasters waiving fees), pay for outdoor antennas (including installation) and extend the converter box program beyond July 31.H.R. 2867: Digital TV Transition Fairness Act, govtrack.us, Retrieved on July 16, 2009. It did not pass. =VHF frequencies and digital television= One of the most common problems was the return to VHF frequencies by stations that had used them when they were analog. Over 480 stations were broadcasting digitally on the VHF spectrum after the transition, up from only 216 on the frequencies before. Many antennas marketed for digital TV are designed for UHF, which most digital stations use. VHF analog signals travel further than UHF signals, but watchable VHF digital signals appear to have a more limited range than UHF with the lower power they are assigned, and they don't penetrate buildings as well, especially in larger cities. Mike Doback, vice president of engineering for Scripps Television, said, \\"It‚Äôs only now that we‚Äôve found out the planning factors were probably wrong in terms of how much power you need to replicate analog service.\\" According to TV consultant Peter Putman, the problem with VHF reception is that VHF antennas must be large to be effective, and indoor antennas do not perform well enough. In addition, channels 2 through 6 are more susceptible to many types of interference. Richard Mertz of Cavell, Mertz & Associates says multipath interference inside the house is also a factor. Some receivers can deal with this problem better than others, but there are no standards. And with amplified antennas or amplifiers, it is possible to overload a converter box. Amplifiers can also cause noise that is interpreted as data. Raycom Media Chief Technology Officer Dave Folsom said, \\"There‚Äôs nothing inherently wrong with VHF. It‚Äôs just easier to have interference, because it goes out further.\\" The FCC sent extra personnel to Chicago, Philadelphia, and New York City to deal with difficulties in those cities. WLS-TV had received 1,735 calls just by the end of the day on June 12, and an estimated 5000 calls in total by June 16. WLS-TV is just one station which may solve its problems by increasing its signal strength, but doing this required making sure no other stations are affected. A low-power analog station, not required to shut down after 30 days like other nightlight stations, aired newscasts that could not be seen by a number of people after the transition, while the stations attempted to solve problems. In Philadelphia, most of the problems were with WPVI-TV, which had the area's leading news program, and public station WHYY-TV. Many people having trouble with those stations could pick up stations from Reading and Atlantic City. Unlike WLS, WPVI had concerns about increasing its signal because of potential interference to other stations and to FM radio. In New York City, many called the FCC because they lived in apartment buildings with a single roof antenna which was not suitable for digital reception. The city reported antenna shortages and numerous requests for cable service. By the end of June, four stations had received permission to increase power. Ten other stations asked for power increases as well, but these were not in major cities; instead, the markets were in rural or mountainous areas such as Montana, Virginia, and Alabama. KNMD-TV in Santa Fe tried an alternate VHF channel. The FCC had two concerns about the requests for more power: some stations just wanted a competitive advantage and were not actually experiencing difficulties. Other stations wanted UHF frequencies instead because UHF worked better with mobile digital TV. However, some stations with legitimate problems have asked to return to their UHF frequencies. Two months after the transition, \\"two or three-dozen\\" stations continued to have problems. Three months after the transition, about 50 stations had applied for a power increase. \\"Approximately a half-dozen stations\\" were still deciding at the end of October about what to do. In some of the cases where stations returned to UHF, interference to nearby stations prevented a power increase. Ironically, KUAC-TV in Fairbanks, Alaska moved from channel 24 back to channel 9 in September 2009. The area never had UHF before DTV, so most people had VHF antennas, while few people lived in apartment buildings. The higher power needed for UHF cost too much, and channel 24 had signal problems, so the station asked to move back. Of 79 stations asking for a new channel, 22 wanted to go from VHF to UHF, and 10 wanted to go from UHF to VHF. Evaluating the transition On June 30, his first day as FCC Chairman, Julius Genachowski said in a speech that the transition \\"succeeded far beyond expectations. You pulled it off by working collaboratively with each other across the agency, and with the Commerce Department and other parts of government, and by thinking creatively to leverage all available resources.\\" Still, the FCC planned a report on how well the transition went, and Genachowski admitted more work was needed. Genachowski's predecessor Michael Copps called the process > A huge transition with significant impact on consumers that was not until > the last moment adequately planned for or coordinated. [It was] a transition > that led to problems that were largely predictable and one that we moved > measurably forward from January to June to the benefit of many consumers. > But it's not a closed book. It is ongoing. There are still problems out > there, lessons to be learned and a document to write. Low-power stations In September 2010, the FCC announced a proposal to set a hard deadline of 2012 for low power stations to broadcast in digital, though this deadline was not adopted. On July 15, 2011, the Federal Communications Commission issued a final ruling regarding Broadcast translator (TX), Low- powered (LP), and Class-A low-powered (-CA) stations, requiring that analog transmitters shut down by September 1, 2015.FCC Sets Deadlines for LPTV, TV Translator and Class A Stations To Convert to Digital - And Gives Hints When Television Spectrum May Be Reclaimed for Broadband Broadcast Law Blog July 19, 2011 Transmitters on channels 52 to 69 were required to vacate their channels by December 31, 2011, but may remain in analog on another channel until the September 1, 2015 deadline. As part of the rules that were imposed, low power VHF stations on channels 2 to 6 can transmit with a maximum ERP 3 kW instead of the previously allowed maximum of 0.3 kW. On August 13, 2009, the Community Broadcasters Association (CBA) announced in a statement that it would shut down after 20 years of representing LPTV stations. One reason given was the cost required to fight \\"restrictive regulations that kept the Class A and LPTV industry from realizing its potential,\\" including the campaign to require analog passthrough, a converter box feature that allows both digital and analog television to be viewed on older TVs. Amy Brown, former CBA executive director, said, \\"some 40% of Class A and LPTV station operators believe they will have to shut down in the next year if they are not helped through the digital transition.\\" On April 24, 2015, the requirement for broadcast translator (TX) and low-powered (-LP) stations to convert by September 1 of that year was suspended, pending the then-upcoming spectrum auction. After the auction's completion in 2017, on May 17 of that year the FCC announced July 13, 2021 as the new analog low-power shutoff date.Post-Auction Rules and Procedures for LPTV and TV Translator Stations Wiley Rein LLP, May 17, 2017 Spectrum reallocation The 2008 United States wireless spectrum auction effectively eliminated 700 MHz UHF channels 52‚Äì69 as of the June 2009 digital transition. After this, the study of how to further increase spectrum for wireless broadband began in 2009. Some plans called for eliminating broadcast TV entirely, but opponents of such a plan said the efforts made during the DTV transition would become pointless. By 2010, voluntary efforts were planned. Sharing channels, made possible by the first transition, was approved in 2012. Another spectrum auction planned for 2014 (and delayed to 2016) created a second digital transition, wherein UHF stations operating on channels 38‚Äì51 in the 600 MHz band were moved into VHF or UHF channels 14‚Äì36. This was done in ten phases from 2018‚Äì2020.  ATSC 3.0  ATSC 3.0 (also known by the moniker NextGen TV) is a new digital television transmission standard which is not backwards compatible with ATSC 1.0, the standard employed in the 2009 digital transition. Transition to ATSC 3.0 is voluntary on both ends: television manufacturers are not required to provide ATSC 3.0 compatible tuners in televisions. Further, digital television stations may elect to broadcast in ATSC 3.0 at any time, with the caveat that they must simulcast ATSC 1.0 signals for up to five years after beginning broadcasts in ATSC 3.0. If and when digital television stations sunset their ATSC 1.0 broadcasts, consumers that wish to see the newer broadcasts will be required to purchase televisions which can receive ATSC 3.0, install a software update (for sets that have the capability to be updated in such a manner), or purchase ATSC 3.0 tuners for their older digital television sets.

The scientific name of the species was first published by Dobson in 1871. Description The upper parts of the cave nectar bat are grey-brown to dark brown to black. The underparts are paler and the neck is sometimes yellowish brown. The muzzle of this bat is elongated, and particularly adapted for drinking nectar. The species has as well an external tail. The head and body length measures , the tail length is about and the forearm length measures Habits and habitat The cave nectar bat is found in primary forests and in disturbed and agricultural areas. It roosts in caves, in larger groups, with some roosts exceeding 50,000 individuals, and it sometimes roosts with other bat species. In some places, this species seems to have adapted well to leafy, semi-urban habitats. Due to its large roosting size it has an IUCN status of \\"least concerned\\" however, only limited data is available on population size and trends. E. spelaea travels many kilometres each night in search of the nectar of flowering trees and shrubs. Because of that, this bat species is a very important pollinator of fruit trees, such as durians, notably Durio zibethinus and Durio graveolens. It also feeds on and pollinates other commercially important crops such as banana (Musa spp.) and jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus). In addition to pollinating these plants, the cave nectar bat is an important pollinator for major crops, including up to 55 species of plants. Their tendencies to pollinate certain plants is determined by the proximity of their living quarters. There are at least thirteen plant taxa that the cave nectar bat feeds upon. The dependence on the proximity of the plants explain the variation of which plants that the cave nectar bats pollinate and feed upon. For this reason, E. spelaea is seen as an important species for pollination in disturbed areas bordering on urban and agricultural farms. Distribution E. spelaea lives in Bangladesh,https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/library/files/documents/RL-549.3-003-v.2.pdf Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia (Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra, Sulawesi and some other small islands), Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, China, India and Timor-Leste. It had been previously recorded from Gomantong Caves, Sukau, Segama, and Madai in Sabah; Niah, Sungai Tinjar, and Kuching in Sarawak; and Sungai Tengah and Kutai in Kalimantan. Conservation This species is killed for bushmeat in Cambodia, Myanmar and the Philippines.  Research  The genome of Eonycteris spelaea was recently sequenced using PacBio long-read sequencing. As a small, frugivorous, specialist nectar-feeding bat with good flight potential and that can breed 1-2 times a year, it is an ideal species as an animal model for bats. Recent evidence has shown this species can carry multiple viruses such as filoviruses, coronaviruses, astrovirus, picornavirus, lyssavirus, pteropine orthoreovirus and flavivirus, all without obvious signs of disease.

She was a public speaker when abolitionism was unpopular. She attended and was prevented from speaking at the World Anti-Slavery Convention in 1840. After slavery was abolished she turned her attention to preaching and women's suffrage. Life Grew was born in Hartford in 1813. Her father was Henry Grew who was an abolitionist religious writer of strong opinions. Her father married four times and Mary's mother was his third wife Kate Morrow who died in 1845. In 1834 she moved to Boston, and later to Philadelphia. Grew was a radical abolitionist. When the Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society was formed, she became a member. In Philadelphia she joined the Philadelphia Female Anti- Slavery Society and served as its corresponding secretary. She wrote their annual reports until 1870. It was a correspondence between Mary and Maria Weston Chapman concerning a women's anti-slavery committee that created the first Anti-Slavery Convention of American Women in New York in 1837. She was a member of the Woman's Anti-Slavery Convention in 1838, which held its sessions in Pennsylvania Hall, surrounded by a furious mob, which destroyed the building by fire a few hours after the convention adjourned. Grew and her father were invited to the World Anti-Slavery Convention beginning 12 June 1840 in London. They departed on the ship Roscoe on 7 May 1840. Other delegates aboard the ship were James and Lucretia Mott, Emily Winslow and her father Isaac, Abby South and Elizabeth Neall. According to Mrs. Mott, Mary was \\"quite intimate\\" with George Bradburn.Mary Grew, Abolitionist and Feminist, 1813-1896, accessed 19 July 2008] After they arrived, Bradburn traveled with the Grews to various locations, including Birmingham, as Mary wanted to see her father's birthplace. Before and during the convention, there was fierce debate about the participation and seating of women delegates and attendees. Her father sided with the British organisers and spoke in favour of the men's right to exclude women, knowing that this would exclude Mary.Dorsey, Bruce. Reforming Men and Women: Gender in the Antebellum City, 2002, . p.179, Accessed 21 July 2008 Eventually women were allowed into the convention, but they were not allowed to speak and they had to sit separately. In 1854 a similar public debate took place when Mary and her father attended the fifth annual National Women's Rights Convention in Philadelphia. Her father debated with Lucretia Mott, during which he lauded the supremacy and authority of men. After slavery was abolished she devoted her energies to the enfranchisement of women. She also became a member of a Unitarian where there were sexual discrimination in the organisation. She was able to preach as she found the pulpits of Unitarian churches open to women. She was also able to preach in northern New England and the pulpits of Free-will Baptists, Methodists and Congregational churches. She was one of the founders of the New Century Club, of Philadelphia. She was also one of the founders of the Pennsylvania Woman Suffrage Association and she became its president.Mary Grew in \\"Woman of the Century\\", Willard and Livermore, page 371, 1893 In November 1870 she chaired the first anniversary meeting of the Pennsylvania Woman Suffrage Association and the poet John Greenleaf Whittier was amongst those expected.
