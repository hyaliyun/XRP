It is found in the aquarium trade. Its common name derives from the dominant males' body pattern, which bears some resemblance the \\"stars and stripes\\". Description Flagfish are small, robust fish, in length, with a truncated snout which has been compared to a bulldogs. They have rounded fins with the dorsal and anal fins positioned posteriorly and adjoining the caudal fin. Females have an obvious spot on their flanks and a clear spot near the posterior end of the dorsal fin, this has an opaque white margin. The fins may be show a slight reddish colour but this comes and goes in any individual but the reason for this is unknown. The females body is mainly olive but marked with turquoise scales. The common name of the Flagfish is derived from the male due to the resemblance of its patterning to the flag of the United States. There is a dark rectangle on the shoulder which is imagined as the blue and white stars in the corner of the US flag and there are stripes along the flanks, some of which are red and others paler, albeit greenish rather than white. The male also has a dark spot positioned at the lower posterior corner of the dark rectangle. The olive-grey colouration and pattern of nondominant males, females, and juveniles underlies the more colourful pattern of the dominant males. Distribution The flagfish is endemic to Florida where it is found in the Florida Peninsula south of the drainage basins of the St. Johns River and Ochlockonee River. Habitat and biology The flagfish normally occurs in shallow, well vegetated freshwater habitats such as backwaters, marshes, canals and ditches but it is occasionally been recorded in slightly brackish water. The flagfish is listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the species of fish which lays the fewest eggs, a female will lay 20 eggs over a period of a few days. They have a courtship display in which the female encourages the male to chase her by nipping him. After that they face each other with the female swimming backwards, the male then backflips. After the eggs are laid the male guards them, attacking fish which stray too close. However, the male may also eat his own eggs or offspring. Other sources say that this species shows no parental care. This species is omnivorous, it is a micropredator feeding on small invertebrates and zooplankton but it will also feed on algae and other plant material. Taxonomy and name The flagfish was described by George Brown Goode and Tarleton Hoffman Bean in 1879 with the type locality given as Lake Monroe, Florida. The generic name honours the American ichthyologist David Starr Jordan (1851-1931). It is closely related to the Yucatan flagfish Garmanella pulchra which is sometimes also placed in the genus Jordanella.

It was directed by Richard Brooks and produced by Pandro S. Berman. The screenplay was by Julius J. Epstein, Philip G. Epstein and Richard Brooks. It was entered into the 1958 Cannes Film Festival. The brothers are played by Yul Brynner, Richard Basehart and William Shatner in his film debut. Plot The story follows Fyodor, the patriarch of the Karamazov family, and his sons. When he tries to decide on an heir, the tensions between the brothers run high, leading to infighting and murder.

Cobb as Fyodor Karamazov * Albert Salmi as Smerdyakov * William Shatner as Alexey Karamazov * Richard Basehart as Ivan Karamazov * Gage Clarke as Defense counsel Production Marilyn Monroe was rumored to be in negotiations to play the role of Grushenka, but several conflicting accounts arose around the time the film entered production. An MGM executive said she'd turned down the role in part because she was expecting a baby, but Monroe's agent denied this and claimed that the studio had never even made her an offer. Richard Brooks said that Monroe would have made a \\"fine\\" Grushenka, but claimed that negotiations fell through \\"because of her contractual demands and personal troubles.\\" Carroll Baker was the next choice for the role, but Warner Bros. put her on suspension and would not loan her out after she refused to play Diana Barrymore in Too Much, Too Soon. Maria Schell stepped in instead, making her American film debut. The film was shot from June to August 1957 on location in London and Paris. Reception Contemporary reviews were mixed to positive. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times wrote, \\"Except for a halfway happy ending that blunts the drama's irony, [Brooks] has done a good job of compressing the substance of the book ... But most of all, Mr. Brooks and Mr. Berman have put upon the screen a large splash of vigorous drama and passion involving interesting, robust characters.\\" Variety declared, \\"Sumptuous and sensitive MGM production by Pandro S. Berman doesn't sacrifice art to entertainment nor lose entertainment in a false conception of what constitutes art. 'The Brothers Karamazov' should be one of the year's commercial successes.\\" Harrison's Reports wrote: \\"\\"Excellent is the word for this absorbing and vigorous screen version of Fyodor Dostoyevsky's epic novel ... The acting is superb, with brilliant performances turned in by Lee J. Cobb, as the lecherous and crafty father, and by Yul Brynner, as his fiery, quick-tempered eldest son.\\" In a generally positive review for the Los Angeles Times, Philip K. Scheuer called Brynner's performance \\"impressive\\" and wrote that Lee J. Cobb as Fyodor \\"succeeds in striking a recognizable and responsive chord with an audience,\\" but found that Maria Schell's Grushenka was played \\"with a persisting Mona Lisa smile that I felt was not only foreign to the role of the materialistic, venal harlot but was also incomprehensibly at variance with her changing moods.\\" John McCarten of The New Yorker declared that the film \\"goes on for about two and a half hours, most of which you'd be better off spending at some more rewarding pursuit ... I think that Mr. Brooks, in addition to being saddled with actors who just can't stand up to the obligations they've assumed, never quite grapples with the ideas that Dostoevski was trying to propound.\\" The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote, \\"There is none of Dostoievsky's profundity or exciting exploration of motive. All the brothers emerge as quite inexplicable people. It is hard to be sympathetic to Dmitri, and not to be embarrassed by Alyosha or scornful of Ivan. The performances throughout suggest that the cast never really knew what it was all about.\\" According to MGM records the film made $2,390,000 in the US and Canada and $3,050,000 elsewhere resulting in a profit of $441,000..

It is one of the main sources for this period in the history of England. Some historians think the author may have been Robert of Bath (also known as Robert of Lewes), Bishop of Bath from 1136 to 1166.British History Online Bishops of Bath and Wells accessed on September 23, 2007Huscroft Ruling England p. 200Davis 1962 The Gesta Stephani was first published in Paris in 1619, from a manuscript in the episcopal library at Laon which was subsequently lost. A fuller manuscript has recently been found, and since published, in the Municipal Library at Valenciennes, having been transferred from the nearby abbey of Vicoigne. The Latin text tells in 120 chapters of the Anarchy of King Stephen's reign, and ends with the accession of King Henry II.  Background and authorship  The Gesta Stephani was written in two books and historian R.H.C. Davis believes that the first twelve years of Stephen's reign‚Äîwhich comprise book I‚Äîwere written in about 1148, while the subsequent account, taken up to the accession of Henry II, was written after 1153.Potter \\"Introduction ‚Äî Authorship\\" Gesta Stephani pp. xx- xxi Davis examined the places named in the texts and found that most of them were in the South-West of England; unusually detailed descriptions of Bristol and Bath, as well as scornful comments about the former, suggest that the author may have been writing in or near Bath. This contrasts with an earlier statement by K.R. Potter that there is \\"no clear indication of any local attachment\\". However, Davis points out that comparisons with the chronicles of other writers based elsewhere in the country reveal considerable south-west bias in the Gesta, which had been overlooked by historians who compared it only with the account of William of Malmesbury, who was also writing in the south-west.Potter \\"Introduction ‚Äî Authorship\\" Gesta Stephani pp. xxi-xxiv The authorship of the Gesta is not known.Davis \\"The Authorship of the Gesta Stephani\\" English Historical Review 33 p. 209Howlett Chronicles of the Reigns of Stephen, Henry II and Richard I, p. viiiHushcroft Ruling England p. 200 According to Richard Howlett, writing in 1886, the author was not from a monastery,Howlett Chronicles of the Reigns of Stephen, Henry II and Richard I p. ix and Davis agreed with this in his analysis of the author, because, while he does show a local bias, his knowledge of Exeter, London, Pevensey and Bedford all show that he was a man who travelled.Potter \\"Introduction ‚Äî Authorship\\" Gesta Stephani p. xxvi Nonetheless, he was not an itinerant, and his writing reveals little knowledge of the north or East of England or the leading baronial families in those parts of the kingdom, while he placed too much emphasis on the exploits of relatively minor barons associated with the south west, including the de Tracy family.Potter \\"Introduction ‚Äî Authorship\\" Gesta Stephani pp. xxvii-xxviii The writer appears to have been a scholar, and his work omits dates and extraneous detail for the sake of literary effect, while employing classical terms to offices and positions rather than their Mediaeval Latin equivalents.Potter \\"Introduction ‚Äî Authorship\\" Gesta Stephani pp. xxix-xxxi Scholars agree that he was a supporter of Henry of Blois, Bishop of Winchester.Potter \\"Introduction ‚Äî Authorship\\" Gesta Stephani p. xxxiiHowlett Chronicles of the Reigns of Stephen, Henry II and Richard I pp. ix-x However, historians differ over their exact relationship: Howlett suggested the author was Henry's chaplain,Howlett Chronicles of the Reigns of Stephen, Henry II and Richard I pp. x-xi but Davis believes that the criticism he gave to Henry in the Gesta makes this unlikely.Potter \\"Introduction ‚Äî Authorship\\" Gesta Stephani pp. xxxii-xxxiii Davis instead suggests that he was a bishop, based on his style of writing, his perspectives on the events he writes about and the places he visited; he goes further to speculate that it may have been Robert of Lewes, Bishop of Bath, who was the author.Potter \\"Introduction ‚Äî Authorship\\" Gesta Stephani pp. xxxiv-xxxviii Robert Bartlett states that he was \\"perhaps\\" the authorBartlett England under the Norman and Angevin Kings p. 99 and Hushcroft writes that it was written either by him \\"or someone close to him\\".Huscroft Ruling England p. 200  Manuscripts  Two manuscripts of the Gesta Stephani have been known to scholars, but one is now lost.

It contains the same four gaps as the first but, where pages appear to be missing in the first, the second manuscript includes gaps in the text, which leads R.A.B. Mynors to suggest that second was copied from the first.Potter \\"Introduction ‚Äî The Text\\" Gesta Stephani pp. xii-xiii  Publication  A manuscript of the Gesta Stephani was discovered in the libraries of the bishop of Laon in the early seventeenth century, and was first printed in 1619 at Paris by the French historian Andr√© Duchesne (1584‚Äì1640) in Historia Normannorum Scriptores Antiqui. It was incomplete at that time, and was lost after Duchesne's death. This text was reprinted in England by R.C. Sewell (1803‚Äì1864) in 1846 and by Richard Howlett (1841‚Äì1917) in 1886; the latter has been praised for its improvements to Duchesne's version and its useful preface. There have been two translations of the work into English, the first being by Thomas Forester in Henry of Huntingdon in 1853 and then second by Joseph Stevenson (1806‚Äì1895) in The Church Historians of England in 1858. Another manuscript was discovered in the Municipal Library, Valenciennes, by Professor R.A.B. Mynors (1903‚Äì1989), who found it included with a version of the Gesta Regum by William of Malmesbury, catalogued in the library as MS 792. This new text continued the history of Stephen's reign up to 1154 and filled in the damaged passages which Duchesne was unable to transcribe.Potter \\"Introduction ‚Äî The Text\\" Gesta Stephani p. xii, xiv In 1955, this version was translated by K.R.

In 1941 the landowner moved them, unaware that he had moved the marker from over the burial point. The exact location of the well is now not known. The Haun‚Äôs Mill Massacre (also Hawn‚Äôs Mill Massacre) occurred on October 30, 1838, when a mob/militia unit from Livingston County, Missouri, attacked a Mormon settlement in eastern Caldwell County, Missouri, after the Battle of Crooked River. By far the bloodiest event in the 1838 Mormon War in Missouri, it has long been remembered by the members of the Latter Day Saint movement. While the spelling \\"Haun\\" is common when referring to the massacre or the mill where it occurred; the mill's owner used the spelling \\"Hawn\\" in legal documents. Hawn's Mill Hawn's Mill was a mill established on the banks of Shoal Creek in Fairview Township, Caldwell County, Missouri in 1835‚Äì1836 by Jacob Hawn.Land Entries Book, Recorder of Deeds Office, Caldwell County Courthouse, Kingston, Caldwell, Missouri 64650, Jacob Hawn, 7 December 1835, Township 56 Range 26 NW¬º NE¬º, 40 acres. Hawn was the son of German emigrants to Canada, who resettled in New York, where Jacob was born. While Jacob moved to Missouri and founded the mill around the same time as the Mormon migration to Missouri, he was not a Mormon. However, by October 1838 there were approximately 75 Mormon families living along the banks of Shoal Creek, about 30Joseph Young accountLand Entries Book, Recorder of Deeds Office, Caldwell County Courthouse, Kingston, Caldwell, Missouri 64650.1840 US Federal Census, Caldwell County Missouri. of them in the immediate vicinity of Hawn's Mill and the James Houston blacksmith shop. Missouri militia The unauthorized militia involved in the massacre was led overall by Colonel Thomas Jennings, of Livingston County with William O. Jennings (Sheriff of Livingston County), Nehemiah Comstock, and William Gee as captains of the three companies. At the time of the attack the militia consisted of 240 men from Daviess, Livingston, Ray, Carroll, and Chariton counties, and included prominent men such as Major Daniel Ashby of the Missouri state legislature and Thomas R. Bryan, Clerk of Livingston County.Baugh, Alexander L, A Call to Arms: the 1838 Mormon Defense of Northern Missouri, Doctoral Dissertation, Brigham Young University, 2000.Joseph Young account. Although the massacre took place a few days after Missouri's governor, Lilburn Boggs, issued his infamous Missouri Executive Order 44 (\\"Extermination Order\\" of 1838) there is debate if the participants in the massacre knew of it. Hyrum Smith reported in the church's archives that Captain Comstock, who previously had assured the Mormons at the mill of their safety, had returned the next day attacking them, saying he had received an order from Governor Boggs via Coronal Ashley. However, historian William G. Hartley opined the local militia likely had not yet received news of this specific executive order, but rather the militia responded to the open hostility to Mormons that was already prevalent in Missouri, even before the order was published.

Shortly before the massacre, anti-Mormon raiders confiscated gun and weapons from Mormon settlers and immigrants. Some of those living in the surrounding area gathered at Hawn's Mill for safety. Truce The threat posed by the growing strength and animosity of the Missouri militia caused considerable concern among the Mormon settlers at Hawn's Mill. They held a council on Sunday, October 28 and decided to organize a defensive force. Thirty-six menMormon Redress Petitions: Documents of the 1833‚Äì1838 Missouri Conflict, Edited by Clark V.

During the council meeting, a delayed group of about ten Mormon emigrant families from Kirtland Camp arrived at the settlement and camped near the blacksmith shop.Mormon Redress Petitions: Documents of the 1833‚Äì1838 Missouri Conflict, Edited by Clark V.

That evening, one of the militia groups sent a representative who negotiated a truce with the settlers. Monday the 29th and most of Tuesday the 30th passed without incident. Massacre On October 30 at approximately 4 p.m., the militia rode into the community. David Evans, a leader in the community, ran towards the militia, waving his hat and calling for peace. Alerted to the militia's approach, most of the Latter-day Saint women and children fled into the woods to the south, while most of the men headed to the blacksmith shop. The building was a particularly vulnerable structure as the widely spaced logs made it easy for the attackers to fire inside. The shop became a deathtrap, since the militia gave no quarter, discharging about 100 rifles into the building. Grand River Township Justice of the Peace Thomas McBride, wounded while escaping the blacksmith shop, surrendered his gun to Jacob S Rogers Jr. who shot him, then hacked his body with a corn knife (scythe blade). According to their own account they fired seven rounds making upwards of 1,600 shots during the attack of Hawn's Mill.Joseph Young account in 1886 History of Caldwell and Livingston counties Missouri. http://cdm16795.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/mocohist/id/62024 The attack lasted 30 to 60 minutes.1886 History of Caldwell and Livingston counties Missouri, p. 148. After the initial attack, several of those who had been wounded or had surrendered were shot dead. Members of the militia entered the shop and found 10-year-old Sardius Smith, 7-year-old Alma Smith (sons of Amanda Barnes Smith), and 9-year-old Charles Merrick hiding under the blacksmith's bellows. Alma and Charles were shot (Charles later died), and a militia man known as \\"Glaze, of Carroll county\\", killed Sardius when he \\"put his musket against Sardius's skull and blew off the top of his head.\\" Later, a William Reynolds would justify the killing by saying, \\"Nits will make lice, and if he had lived he would have become a Mormon.\\" William Champlin who was \\"playing possum\\" heard the conversations, was discovered, held captive a few days, then released. Several other bodies were mutilated, while many women were assaulted. Houses were robbed, wagons, tents, and clothing were stolen, and horses and livestock were driven off, leaving the surviving women and children destitute. As a result of the massacre 17 Mormons died: Hiram Abbott (25), Elias Benner (43), John Byers, Alexander Campbell, Simon Cox, Josiah Fuller (35), Austin Hammer (34), John Lee, Benjamin Lewis (35), Thomas McBride (62), Charles Merrick (9), Levi Merrick (30), William Napier (43), George S. Richards (15), Sardius Smith (10), Warren Smith (44), and John York (62). Fifteen more had been injured: Jacob Foutz (38), Jacob Hawn (34), Charles Jameson (35), Nathan K. Knight (36), Isaac Leany (24), Tarlton Lewis (33), Gilmon Merrill (30), George Myers (29), Jacob Myers Jr.(23), Jacob Potts (25), Hiram Rathbun, Alma Smith (7), Mary Stedwell, John Walker (44), and William Yokum (33). There were a few uninjured men, including William Champlin (44), Ellis Eames (48), Rial Eames (25), David Lewis (24), and David Evans (34). The next morning, fourteen of the dead were slid from a plank into a large unfinished dry well and covered with straw and a thin layer of dirt.1886 History of Caldwell and Livingston counties Missouri, p. 150. Benjamin Lewis (33), originally buried on the David Lewis farm, was later exhumed and moved to a local cemetery; Charles Merrick (9) died later and was buried elsewhere; and Hiram Abbott (25) was later removed to his father's place where he died.David Lewis autobiography Four of the 240 militiamen were wounded, but none fatally. John Hart, a Livingston resident, was wounded in the arm. John Renfrow had his thumb shot off. Allen England, a citizen of Daviess, was severely wounded in the thigh.1886 History of Caldwell and Livingston counties, Missouri http://cdm.sos.mo.gov/cdm/compoundobject/collection/mocohist/id/62024/rec/74 Jacob S.

Aftermath After the massacre, Philo Dibble stated that \\"Brother Joseph had sent word by Hawn, who owned the mill, to inform the brethren who were living there to leave and come to Far West, but Mr. Hawn did not deliver the message.\\" David Lewis relates \\"Although we had been counseled by Joseph the Prophet to leave the mill and go to Far West, but being deceived by the messenger we sent him for council, we understood it not, for our messenger said to Joseph what shall we do that is at the mill, Joseph said gather up all of you and come to Far West. \\"What?\\" said the messenger, whose name was Jacob Hawn, the owner of mill, \\"leave the mill and let it be burnt down? We think we can maintain it.\\" \\"If you maintain it\\" said Joseph, \\"you will do well do as you please.\\" The messenger returned and said if we thought we could maintain the mill it was Joseph's council for us to do it, if we thought not, to come to Far West and we thought from the way the thing was represented it would be like cowards to leave and not try to maintain it, and as they agreed to be at peace we thought to gather up our houses would be useless, for we did not know that it was Joseph's decided council for us to do so . . .\\"David Lewis autobiography https://catalog.churchofjesuschrist.org/record/d9dd0acc-9381-47c5-8c4c-9c996ed19f33?view=browse It appears that Hawn had received Joseph Smith's direction to relocate to Far West but did not convey this direction to any of the others at Hawn's Mill. Of the matter, Smith recorded, \\"Up to this day God had given me wisdom to save the people who took counsel. None had ever been killed who abode by my counsel.\\" Then he recorded that innocent lives could have been saved at Hawn's Mill had his counsel been received and followed. \\"For I am the Lord your God, and will save all those of your brethren who have been pure in heart, and have been slain in the land of Missouri, saith the Lord.\\"Doctrine and Covenants 124:54. Captain Nehemiah Comstock's contingent of Livingston militia occupied the mill for nearly three weeks harassing and plundering the Mormons. Life during the winter of 1838-1839 became essentially that of day-to-day survival. Most of the families banded together until they could make arrangements to move along with the rest of the Saints to Illinois. Non-Mormon Harrison Severe, who had refused to join the mob, left with the Mormons. By the end of February 1839, all of the Mormons had left.Baugh, Alexander L, A Call to Arms: the 1838 Mormon Defense of Northern Missouri, Brigham Young University, 2000, p. 126.1886 History of Caldwell and Livingston counties Missouri, p. 158. http://cdm16795.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/mocohist/id/62024. Jacob Hawn moved to Oregon and became a pioneer settler of Yamhill County. As this and other confrontations unfolded between Mormons and the people in the state of Missouri, Mormons appealed for redress from the federal government, accusing the state of Missouri with complicity in violence against Mormons for the state's failure to investigate or prosecute those involved.Mormon Redress Petitions: Documents of the 1833‚Äì1838 Missouri Conflict, Edited by Clark V. Johnson, 1992, http://cdm15999.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/rsc/id/44782 In 1941, Mr. P.E. Gastineau of Cowgill, Missouri, owner of the land, gave permission for Mr. Glenn Setzer, ex-county official, to place a commemorative marker, and hold a program on July 13.Missouri Mormon Frontier Foundation Newsletter, Number 18/19, Summer/Fall 1998, pp. 14-16. Until 2012, the grounds of the massacre were maintained as a historic site by the Community of Christ. In May 2012, it was announced that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints had acquired the property and the Far West burying ground from the Community of Christ.

30 July 1870) was a famous Norwegian poet and journalist who is remembered for poetry, travel writing, and his pioneering use of Landsm√•l (now known as Nynorsk).Vinje, Aasmund Olavsson (Nynorsk kultursentrum) Background Vinje was born into a poor but well- read family in Vinje, Telemark. He had a voracious appetite for learning and supported himself in part by teaching. He earned his university entrance exam after attending the same school as Henrik Ibsen, studied law, and became an attorney. Career Vinje founded the periodical D√∏len (The dales-man) in 1858, in which he published travel accounts, and editorial comments on art, language and politics that serve as records for the period in which he lived. D√∏len ceased publication in 1870. Vinje did much to articulate the difference between city and rural life in Norway and was among the sophisticated exponents of Norwegian romantic nationalism. Despite this, he was also known for his critical scepticism and \\"dual vision\\" (): that is, looking at both sides of the coin. He was politically active to the extent that the government fired him from his work as an attorney for criticizing its foreign policy. Among his writings, the ' (Travel memories from the summer of 1860, translated into English under the title Travel memories from Norway 1860) ranks in high esteem in Norwegian literature, describing a journey on foot from Oslo to Trondheim in order to cover the coronation of King Charles in the Nidarosdomen cathedral for his periodical. It can be seen as a program for Vinje and the D√∏len that the description deals more warm-heartedly with his meetings with ordinary people along the journey than with the royalties he encountered at the coronation. In 1863 he wrote A Norseman's View of Britain and the British, which was translated into Norwegian ten years later. Some of Vinje's poetry is still very much alive in Norway, especially the poems ' (English: At Rondane) and ' (English: The Last Spring) with tunes by Edvard Grieg. Edvard Grieg composed melodies for many of Vinje's poems, and in 1881, Grieg published ' (English: Twelve melodies to Poems of A. O. Vinje, for voice and piano), Opus 33, which include The Last Spring and At Rondane. Dying from stomach cancer, Vinje decided to spend his last days in the countryside. He died as a guest of his friend, minister (later bishop) Anton Christian Bang at Gran in Hadeland on 30 July 1870 and is buried nearby in the churchyard of the Sister churches at Granavollen ('). In 1873, a large monument with a bust of Vinjes by Brynjulf Bergslien was erected at the site.Aasmund Olavsson Vinje ‚Äì utdypning (Store norske leksikon) Today Aasmund Vinje paths exist in several Norwegian cities and towns including Oslo, Stavanger, Trondheim, Moss, Fjellhamar, Corby, Hamar, Gj√∏vik, Rjukan, Skien and Mandal.

The film is based on the 1956 novel The Philadelphian, by Richard P. Powell. Plot Newlywed Kate Judson Lawrence (Diane Brewster) is distraught to discover on her wedding night that her upper-class Philadelphia Main Line husband, William (Adam West), is unable to consummate their marriage for an unspecified reason that is suggested to be because he is homosexual or impotent. After he leaves her that night, she seeks comfort from longtime working-class friend and former beau Mike Flanagan (Brian Keith). The next day, Kate learns that William died in a car wreck. She gives birth to a son, Anthony Judson \\"Tony\\" Lawrence, and raises him in light of his last name. Years pass. Tony (Paul Newman) becomes a smart, ambitious college student working his way through school as a construction worker with his sights on becoming a lawyer. One day, he encounters socialite Joan Dickinson (Barbara Rush) when she has a minor car accident. They soon fall in love, though Joan is expected by nearly everyone in her lofty social circle to marry millionaire Carter Henry (Anthony Eisley). Their mutual friend, Chester \\"Chet\\" Gwynn (Robert Vaughn), warns her not to let social pressure separate her from the one she loves as it did him. They decide to elope. However, Joan's father Gilbert Dickinson (John Williams) persuades Tony to postpone the wedding by offering him invaluable career help and a job at the highly esteemed law firm of which he is a full partner. Believing Tony has allowed himself to be bought, a disillusioned Joan sails to Europe. When Carter follows her, she marries him. Devastated and angry, Tony realizes that Joan's father wanted her to marry into another wealthy family, and only offered Tony help with his career in the hope of breaking them up. Tony then devotes himself to working his way up the social ladder and learning the game of the wealthy. Fellow student Louis Donetti (Paul Picerni) tells Tony about a wonderful opportunity he has to assist John Marshall Wharton (Otto Kruger) in writing a law book. Tony becomes acquainted with Wharton's much younger wife Carol (Alexis Smith) and steals the job from his classmate. Living and working at Wharton's mansion, Tony impresses his employer with his expertise. Carol becomes attracted to him. She comes to his bedroom one night, but he cunningly defuses the dangerous situation by asking her to divorce her husband and marry him, knowing that she will be unwilling to do that. Wharton offers Tony a job at his own prestigious firm. Tony accepts, deciding to specialize in the relatively new area of tax law, where there is more opportunity for rapid advancement. When the Korean War starts, interrupting his career, Tony serves as a JAG officer. Others are not as fortunate. Chet loses an arm in combat, and Carter Henry is killed. Upon returning home, Tony gets a lucky break. Forced to work over the Christmas holiday, he is available when the very rich Mrs. J. Arthur Allen (Billie Burke) needs her will amended. With his specialized knowledge, he shows her how to avoid paying a great deal of taxes. Mrs. Allen responds by designating Tony to manage her finances, instead of her longtime lawyer Gilbert Dickinson. Tony also begins mending his relationship with Joan. Success after success follows, and Tony becomes well known and respected by the Philadelphia elite. One night, Tony is called to the police station to pick up Chet, his disheveled, drunken friend. Donetti (now a public prosecutor) has Chet taken into custody and charged with the first-degree murder of Morton Stearnes (Robert Douglas), Chet's uncle and tight-fisted guardian of his inheritance. Chet insists on Tony defending him, fearing that his relatives, particularly family patriarch Dr. Shippen Stearnes (Frank Conroy), are more interested in avoiding a scandal than proving his innocence. Despite having no experience with criminal law, Tony reluctantly agrees. His work is further complicated when Shippen Stearnes threatens to reveal that Tony's real father is Mike Flanagan if Tony embarrasses the Stearnes clan. When Joan offers to hire a reliable attorney, Tony realizes that she fears that he has sold out once again. At the trial, Tony discredits the testimony of George Archibald (Richard Deacon), Morton Stearnes' butler. He gets Shippen to admit that Morton had a brain tumor and was mentally depressed, and that he might have committed suicide. The jury finds Chet not guilty. After the trial, Tony and Joan reconcile.

Historically part of Berkshire, it stands on the Seacourt Stream, a stream running off the River Thames. The intersection of the A34 and A420 is to the village's north. Topography Botley, aside from central offices and a modest row of shops, is a residential suburb of Oxford. Generally house prices are above average for the Oxford area, from average in its east (similar to much of Dean Court), to very expensive towards where the settlement adjoins Cumnor Hill, in its south.Property heat maps It lies, apart from a small section which is southeast, southwest of the junction between the A34 (Oxford ring road) and the A420 westward to Swindon. The contiguous neighbourhood Dean Court adjoins Botley to its west, in the Cumnor civil parish. The other settlements which merge into this settlement are North Hinksey and Cumnor Hill.Grid square map Ordnance survey website Elevations range from 56m on the Hinksey Stream marking much of the eastern border to the western border which ranges from 80 to 120m AOD from north to south. The southern point is a border of Cumnor Hill and adjoins Matthew Arnold School. Landmarks and economy Elms Parade Botley shops comprise Elms Parade and the West Way shopping precinct. The various large office buildings along the main road include Seacourt Tower, known locally as \\"Botley Cathedral\\" owing to its small metal spire, originally built in 1965‚Äì66 as a car showroom and garage to a design by Beecher and Stamford.Sherwood & Pevsner, 1974, p. 333 It remains in the ownership of Hartwell Ford. Religion Botley's Church of England church of St Peter and St Paul on West Way, built in 1958, is one of four in its benefice which reaches outside the historic ecclesiastical parish to include St Frideswide's Church, Oxford, St Lawrence's Church, North Hinksey and St. Margaret of Antioch, Binsey. Other Christian churches in Botley include Calvery Chapel and Roman Catholic Church, the oldest being Botley Baptist established in 1890. History Botley was first settled in the Saxon era. Its toponym comes from Old English, meaning a woodland clearing of a man called Bota.Hanson, 1995, page 7 It has since inception fallen within the parish of North Hinksey, and so was historically in the county of Berkshire, as marked in its northern half by the Vale of White Horse district boundary on the map. Because the main road west out of Oxford has passed through Botley since the 16th century, development since then was centred here rather than in the village of North Hinksey itself, slightly further south east. From the 1880s the centre of the village began to be called Old Botley, in distinction to the New Botley development along Botley Road in Oxford.Hanson, 1995, page 26 The name Old Botley is preserved in a street set back from the main road. The major development which began in the 1930s took place to the west, beyond the current ring road. To the north of Botley was the lost village of Seacourt. The site of the former village is in neighbouring Wytham parish, but it is commemorated in Botley in the names of Seacourt Tower and the Seacourt Bridge public house. Localities =New Botley= A park and ride site is closest to Botley itself in the much narrower New Botley which is confined by low- lying playing fields, an allotment site and river meadows on the north and south sides. Immediately east is the seven arches bridge, which is listed.Seven Arches Bridge To the north side of that section is a golf driving range and on the south side, the large Osney Mead industrial estate.

Founded in 1915 by Helen Keller and George A. Kessler, the organization's mission is to save the sight and lives of the most vulnerable and disadvantaged. George A. Kessler, also known as the \\"Champagne King,\\" was a passenger on the in 1915 when it was torpedoed by a German U-boat. When he was fighting for his life in the cold waters of the Atlantic off the coast of Ireland, he vowed that if he survived, he would devote much of his time and substantial financial resources to a worthwhile cause. The cause he chose was assisting Allied soldiers blinded in the service. He later befriended Helen Keller and helped found the organization that became Helen Keller International. Helen Keller International's two major areas of expertise are Eye Health and Nutrition. Its Eye Health programs address the major causes of blindness in the world, including cataract, trachoma and onchocerciasis, and treating refractive error. Its nutrition programs include vitamin A, iron/folate, and multi-micronutrient supplementation, fortification of commonly used foods, dietary diversification, community- and school- gardening as well as school health activities, the promotion of breastfeeding and complementary feeding, and nutritional surveillance to provide critical data to governments and other development partners. Each year, Helen Keller's programs benefit millions of people. Currently, Helen Keller International works in 20 countries around the world in Africa, Asia and the United States. Global headquarters are located in New York City, and programs are also developed and administered through regional offices, currently located in Senegal and Phnom Penh, as well as through 19 country offices and an additional development office in Paris. HKI has country offices in Burkina Faso, Bangladesh, Cameroon, Cambodia, C√¥te d'Ivoire, China, Guinea, Indonesia, Mali, Mozambique, Myanmar, Nepal, Niger, Nigeria, Philippines, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, and Vietnam. Helen Keller International has received the 2014 BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in the Development Cooperation category for agricultural programs that help families and villages to raise their own nutritious foods. \\"Hunger and low dietary diversity reduce cognitive function, physical capacity, resistance to disease and quality of life and lifetime earnings. Heller Keller International champions Homestead Food Production, an innovative, interdisciplinary program that promotes improved agricultural and nutritional practices in a synergistic fashion. This approach is mostly applied to communities that have difficult access to labor and food markets,\\" in the words of the jury's citation. Activities Helen Keller International has launched and completed several initiatives to combat malnutrition and blindness in Bangladesh. =Nutrition Surveillance Project (NSP)= This programme was started by HKI in 1990 to monitor the health impact of severe flooding in Bangladesh. It is a collaborative effort which involves the Government of Bangladesh (GOB), international and local Non- Governmental Organisations (NGO). The programme essentially provides up-to- date and dependable information on the prevalence of malnutrition and morbidity in children, household socioeconomic characteristics and food prices. Data are collected by authorities in selected rural districts and urban slums in the country. The NSP data have also been used by the GOB to improve or develop nutrition and health programmes such as the national vitamin A capsule distribution program. NSP has proven to be an excellent tool to aid long-term planning in health policies, to provide input for programme management and evaluation and to give timely warning of the need for intervention to prevent critical deterioration in food consumption. =Diabetic Retinopathy= Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of blindness. Heller Keller International helps prepare health care systems to identify and treat Diabetic Retinopathy. In collaboration with Chittagong Eye Infirmary and Training Complex and the Diabetes Association of Bangladesh, HKI began a pilot project in 2009 to improve patients' access to sight-saving Diabetic Retinopathy treatment regardless of their ability to pay. =Homestead Food Production (HFP)= This programme aims to reduce malnutrition and increase food availability through creation of home gardens and small farms for raising livestock. In collaboration with local NGOs, HKI provides the seedlings, chicks, start up materials and technical skills to communities. Varieties of fruits and vegetables are grown in these home gardens to provide supplies of nutrient rich foods all year round. The objectives are to increase participants' micro-nutritional intakes by consuming a wider variety of foods, develop communities and empower women. HFP started in 1990 as a pilot project in Bangladesh with 1000 households participating. It includes nutrition education to complement home gardening. Following initial success, HKI launched the NGO Gardening and Nutrition Education Surveillance Project (NGNESP) which expanded the programme to communities across the country in 1993. By 2012, 900,000 households and 4.5 million people are participating in the project, with the help of 52 local NGOs. Women organise 90% of the gardens. A 2002 research shows that in a 3 months period, households participating in the HFP consumed had a daily per capita consumption of vegetables of 160g, more than double of the 71g for non- participating households. =Vitamin A Supplementation= Vitamin A deficiency causes blindness and increases mortality rate for young children and women. The deficiency can be prevented with two doses of high potency Vitamin A capsules every year. With the cost of providing the capsules at $1 per person per year, Vitamin A supplementation is a cost-efficient initiative. HKI started the Vitamin A supplementation project in Bangladesh in 1978. Its partnership with the GOB began in 1982. The Bangladesh Nutritional Blindness Study was conducted, and it indicated that there was a high prevalence of vitamin A deficiency. By 2005, Vitamin A deficiency among children 12 to 59 months, as measured by prevalence of night blindness, has decreased to 0.04% from 3.76% in 1982. =Leadership= Kathy Spahn is President and Chief Executive Officer, joining in March 2005. Prior to Helen Keller International, Ms. Spahn was President and Executive Director of Orbis, a global non-profit organization dedicated to the prevention and treatment of blindness in the developing world. Partnerships Helen Keller International is a partner in Compact2025, a partnership that develops and disseminates evidence-based advice to politicians and other decision-makers aimed at ending hunger and undernutrition in the coming 10 years, by 2025. HKI is represented on the Leadership Council of Compact2025 by its president Kathy Spahn.Leadership Council members from the website of the Compact 2025 partnership References External links * International International charities Health charities in the United States Medical and health organizations based in New York City ","title":"Helen Keller International"},{"id":"1365545","text":"Vice Admiral Robert Lee Ghormley (15 October 1883 ‚Äì 21 June 1958) was an admiral in the United States Navy who served as Commander, South Pacific Area during World War II.

From 1911 to 1913, Lieutenant Ghormley was Aide and Flag Lieutenant to the Commander in Chief, Pacific Fleet, participating in the 1912 campaign in Nicaragua. That was followed by duty at the U.S. Naval Academy starting in June 1913. He was assigned to the battleship in June 1916. Ghormley was promoted to lieutenant commander on May 23, 1917 and spent most of World War I on Nevada and as a flag aide. Late in the conflict, he was promoted to commander and became assistant director of the Overseas Division of the Naval Overseas Transportation Service. In 1919 he was awarded the Army Distinguished Service Medal for his service in this position. From 1920 to 1922, he commanded the patrol vessel and the destroyer , including Mediterranean Sea duty in the latter. Mid-career Promoted to the rank of commander in July 1921, Ghormley served as Aide to the Assistant Secretary of the Navy from 1923 to 1925 and as executive officer of the battleship for the next two years. In 1927 he became Secretary of the Navy's General Board, in Washington, D.C., Captain Ghormley was Chief of Staff to the commanders of the Battle Force and U.S. Fleet during the early 1930s. After working with the Chief of Naval Operations, he became commanding officer of the battleship Nevada from June 25, 1935 to June 23, 1936. In 1936, he returned to the U.S. Fleet staff. By 1938, he completed the senior course at the Naval War College. Rear Admiral Ghormley became Director of the War Plans Division and Assistant Chief of Naval Operations, remaining in those positions until August 1940. He then was sent to the United Kingdom as a Special Naval Observer for President Franklin D. Roosevelt. He was subsequently promoted to vice admiral on October 1, 1938. World War II =Pearl Harbor attack, repercussions and immediate consequences= The attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, by the Japanese Imperial Navy using fast offensive aircraft carrier forces wrought destruction on the American battleships there at anchor. This dramatically changed the strategic and tactical (doctrinal) emphasis of the U.S. Navy for the rest of World War II. Until the attack on Pearl Harbor, the battleship was widely accepted and held as the supreme weapon of naval power. The attack from aircraft launched by carriers made it clear that air power had instantly superseded the battleship as the primary asset of naval power. In the days after the Pearl Harbor attack, the U.S. Navy attempted to immediately reinforce Wake Island, and dispatched Vice Admiral William Halsey Jr. on raids against various enemy held islands. In addition, naval intelligence had decoded transmissions indicating an attack on Midway Island, which if taken by the Japanese would have immediately threatened Hawaii. All of the pressing needs to protect and retaliate required the use of the few aircraft carriers then available, along with their escort and support ships. Into the summer months of 1942, the United States struggled on a \\"shoestring\\" to rush an offensive force consisting of the 1st Marine Division (11,000 men) commanded by Marine Major General Alexander Vandegrift and supported by two carrier task forces ( and ). The plan, called Operation Watchtower, was to immediately attack, seize, and hold the Solomon Islands of Guadalcanal and Tulagi. =South Pacific Command assignment= Calhoun, Towers, Ghormley and Fitch. It was into these critical early days of the Solomons Campaign that Vice Admiral Ghormley was rush-assigned command of South Pacific (COMSOPAC) on the recommendations of Admiral Chester Nimitz, Commander-in-Chief, United States Pacific Fleet, and Chief of Naval Operations Fleet Admiral Ernest J. King. It is possible that Ghormley was appointed to the position over other commanders with superior carrier and aviation expertise and experience because of his association with President Roosevelt. Nimitz's choice was Admiral William S. Pye, but since Pye had recalled the Wake Island relief attempt, Admiral King was hostile to Pye. Vice Admiral Ghormley had last held sea command in 1938 on the battleship Nevada and had not been back to a sea command since. And, in addition, he had never commanded a carrier. Upon taking command as COMSOPAC, Ghormley had only the carriers Saratoga and Wasp, later joined by . Ghormley's performance appeared to be lackluster and pessimistic, as reflected in his continuing reports to Admiral Nimitz at Pearl Harbor, to which Admiral King took exceptional note. Ghormley had been directed through original operational orders by Admiral King to \\"personally oversee\\" the Guadalcanal/Tulagi attacks by U.S. forces, meaning he was expected to be on site or in the immediate area of conflict. However, Ghormley was either absent in the early planning phases and subsequent invasions or else holed up in his headquarters once he finally moved to Noum√©a, more than from Guadalcanal. He apparently was overwhelmed by the quick developments of the overall operation as well as lack of immediate resources, paperwork, myriad details and petty political squabbling caused by New Caledonia's French government hosts, rather than being present in the immediate conflict areas. It was noted that Ghormley failed to set foot on Guadalcanal or to make himself \\"visible\\" to combat forces as a morale presence. Ghormley also conveyed weak or indecisive communications to his commanders and was absent at critical planning meetings, which were marked by vociferous arguments between Admirals Frank Jack Fletcher and Richmond K. Turner over the length of time that carriers would be able to provide air cover to landing forces and supply ships. Fletcher seemed to place more concern on protecting the aircraft carriers and on the overall fuel needs of the fleet over the immediate support requirements of the invasion force. Part of the problem was also due to Fletcher's attempts to interpret Admiral Nimitz's dictum against over-exposure of carriers to attack unless more damage could be inflicted upon the enemy; Admiral Fletcher was left to interpret this rather than Vice Admiral Ghormley, and Fletcher's interpretation was seen as over-cautious. The heated arguments aside, Ghormley had assigned Fletcher as the Commander, Expeditionary Force who had overriding authority to move carrier air support out of the battle area. After only 36 hours, and with at least two to three days (estimate as high as five by Turner) needed to unload supplies to the Marines fighting on Guadalcanal, Fletcher ordered carriers to pull out of the immediate critical invasion operation, leaving many supply ships unloaded and vulnerable to Japanese attack, and with no carrier air support for ground forces. As a result of all these mitigating circumstances, problems and misjudgments, both Admirals Nimitz and King became highly concerned with the precarious state of the conflict and Ghormley's ability to command in a sound manner. In consequence, Vice Admiral William F. Halsey flew to Noum√©a on October 16, 1942 to interview Ghormley and his staff. It became apparent to Admiral Nimitz that Ghormley and his staff did not have answers to serious questions that they should have had. Ghormley during a inspection of the fire equipment at Manana Naval Barracks, Hawaii, August 1944. Dismayed by Ghormley's shortcomings, on 18 October Admiral Nimitz replaced him with Vice Admiral Halsey, who quickly and decisively took leadership command and fully restored the balance of trust. Placing Halsey in charge demonstrated that the job had required a decisive, aggressive and trained battle carrier admiral. As Ghormley should have done from the beginning, Halsey had no problem with making frequent numerous appearances and taking the lead. Some time later, according to Elmer B. Potter, the biographer of Nimitz, Ghormley \\"was found to be suffering from abscessed teeth, possibly the main cause of his shortcomings as ComSoPac.\\" =Later service= Following his dismissal from South Pacific Force, Ghormley served in Washington, D.C., attached to the headquarters, United States Fleet under Admiral Ernest J. King, before he was ordered to Hawaii as Commandant of the 14th Naval District in February 1943. While in this capacity, he was responsible for the defense of the Hawaiian Islands, and islands to westward, including Midway, and Johnston. Ghormley served in this capacity until October 1944, when he was relieved by Rear admiral William R. Furlong and ordered to European Theater of Operations for new assignment. He was decorated with Legion of Merit for his service on Hawaii. In December 1944, Ghormley became Commander, United States Naval Forces Germany with additional duty as Senior Naval member of the Group Control Council for Germany, and served in that position for the rest of the War and was responsible for the directing of effective organization in carrying out the demilitarization of the German Navy and the collection of valuable intelligence material. He was decorated with Navy Distinguished Service Medal and returned to the United States in December 1945. He spent his last months of active duty as a member of the General Board, at the Navy Department, and retired on August 1, 1946, completing 40 years on active duty. Retirement and death While recovering from surgery in 1958 at Bethesda Naval Hospital, Ghormley died at age 74 on 21 June, and was buried with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery, Virginia. His wife, Lucile Lyon Ghormley (1890‚Äì1966) is buried beside him. They had two children, a daughter Alicia Ghormley Robards (1914‚Äì2001) and a son Robert Lee Ghormley Jr. (1923‚Äì2012), who also served in the Navy and retired as Commander.

She was formerly constituency MSP for Edinburgh Central from the 1999 Scottish Parliament election. Early life and career Boyack was born in Glasgow and brought up in Edinburgh. Her father, Jim Boyack, was an important figure in the Labour Party and the campaign for Scottish devolution. She was educated at the state comprehensive Royal High School, Edinburgh, where she was one of the first female pupils. Starting in 1979, Boyack studied Modern History and Politics at the University of Glasgow, graduating with a Scottish MA Honours degree. She became active in the Labour club, where she was a prot√©g√© of Margaret Curran. She was chair of the Labour club from 1981 until 1982, and chair of the National Organisation of Labour Students from 1985 until 1986. During her time at Glasgow, she was involved in supporting the twinning with Bir Zeit University in the West Bank. After graduating, she gained a Diploma in Town and Country Planning at Heriot- Watt University. Boyack worked as a town planner in the London Borough of Brent then as a strategic planner in Central Regional Council in Stirling. She then became a lecturer at the School of Planning and Housing at Heriot-Watt University and was Convener of the Scottish Branch of the Royal Town Planning Institute in 1997. Political career = Member of the Scottish Parliament: 1999‚Äì2016 = Boyack was elected to the new Scottish Parliament in the 1999 election for the Edinburgh Central constituency. She was Minister for Transport and the Environment in the Scottish Executive from 1999 until 2000. Then, she was Minister for Transport and Planning from 2000 until 2001, during which time she introduced one of Scottish Labour's flagship policies of free bus travel for people over 60 and disabled people. Re-elected for her constituency in the 2003 Scottish Parliament election, Boyack was elected by MSPs as Convener of the Scottish Parliament Environment and Rural Development Committee in June 2003. In this role, she received the RSPB Goldcrest Award in November 2004 for the most outstanding contribution to the development of environmental policy in Scotland since devolution. Later, in December 2005, she was named the Scottish Renewables Best Politician. She stood down from the committee in January 2007, when she returned to the Scottish Executive as Deputy Minister for the Environment and Rural Development. Boyack lost her Edinburgh Central constituency seat in the 2011 Scottish Parliament election to Marco Biagi of the Scottish National Party (SNP). However, she was elected on the Lothian regional list as one of seven additional members. Following a landslide victory by the SNP in the election, Boyack co-chaired a review of the Labour Party in Scotland with Jim Murphy, commissioned by Ed Miliband in May 2011 and which reported back in Autumn of that year. On 28 October 2014, Boyack declared she would stand in the upcoming election to become the Leader of the Scottish Labour Party. She came third to Jim Murphy and Neil Findlay with 9.24% of the vote. = Outside the Scottish Parliament: 2016‚Äì2019 = Boyack again contested the Edinburgh Central seat in the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, but was defeated by Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, who stood for the same constituency. Boyack was also placed third on the Lothian regional list of Labour candidates behind Kezia Dugdale and Neil Findlay, but did not return to Holyrood following the election since Labour won only two list seats. In February 2017, Boyack was appointed as Head of Public Affairs at the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations, the membership body for social housing providers in Scotland. = Return following Kezia Dugdale's resignation: 2019‚Äìpresent = Boyack in 2019On 30 April 2019, it was announced Boyack would return to the Scottish Parliament as a list MSP, following Kezia Dugdale's decision to vacate her seat in the summer. As an unsuccessful Labour candidate on the Lothian regional list in 2016, Boyack was the next person on the list if a seat was vacated. In September 2019, Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard made her Spokesperson for Local Government.  Personal life  Boyack married former long-term partner Andrew Walters in December 2000. They had planned to marry in the October but postponed the wedding due to the death of Donald Dewar. The couple divorced in 2003 and they had no children together.

The previous year, the newly constructed Roman navy established naval superiority over Carthage. The Romans used this advantage to invade Carthage's homeland, which roughly aligned with modern-day Tunisia in North Africa. After landing on the Cape Bon Peninsula and conducting a successful campaign, the fleet returned to Sicily, leaving Regulus with 15,500 men to hold the lodgement in Africa over the winter. Instead of holding his position, Regulus advanced towards the city of Carthage and defeated the Carthaginian army at the Battle of Adys. The Romans followed up and captured Tunis, only from Carthage. Despairing, the Carthaginians sued for peace, but Regulus's proposed terms were so harsh the Carthaginians decided to fight on. They gave charge of the training of their army, and eventually operational control, to the Spartan mercenary general Xanthippus. In the spring of 255 BC, Xanthippus led an army strong in cavalry and elephants against the Romans' infantry-based force. The Romans had no effective answer to the elephants, their outnumbered cavalry were chased from the field and the Carthaginian cavalry then surrounded most of the Romans and wiped them out; 500 survived and were captured, including Regulus. A force of 2,000 Romans avoided being surrounded and retreated to Aspis. The war continued for another 14 years, mostly on Sicily or in nearby waters, before ending with a Roman victory; the terms offered to Carthage were more generous than those proposed by Regulus. Primary sources \\"a remarkably well- informed, industrious, and insightful historian\\". The main source for almost every aspect of the First Punic War is the historian Polybius ( ‚Äì BC), a Greek sent to Rome in 167 BC as a hostage. His works include a now lost manual on military tactics, but he is best known for his The Histories, written sometime after 167 BC, or about a century after the Battle of the Bagradas River. Polybius's work is considered broadly objective and largely neutral as between Carthaginian and Roman points of view. Carthaginian written records were destroyed along with their capital, Carthage, in 146 BC and so Polybius's account of the First Punic War is based on several, now-lost, Greek and Latin sources. Polybius was an analytical historian and wherever possible personally interviewed participants in the events he wrote about. Only the first book of the forty comprising The Histories deals with the First Punic War. The accuracy of Polybius's account has been much debated over the past 150 years, but the modern consensus is to accept it largely at face value, and the details of the battle in modern sources are almost entirely based on interpretations of Polybius's account. He was on the staff of Scipio Aemilianus when Scipio led a Roman army during the Third Punic War on a campaign through many of the locations which featured in the events of 256‚Äì255 BC. The modern historian Andrew Curry considers that \\"Polybius turns out to [be] fairly reliable\\"; while the classicist Dexter Hoyos describes him as \\"a remarkably well-informed, industrious, and insightful historian\\". Other, later, histories of the war exist, but in fragmentary or summary form, and they usually cover military operations on land in more detail than those at sea. Modern historians usually also take into account the later histories of Diodorus Siculus and Dio Cassius, although the classicist Adrian Goldsworthy states that \\"Polybius' account is usually to be preferred when it differs with any of our other accounts.\\" Other sources include inscriptions, coins, archaeological evidence and empirical evidence from reconstructions such as the trireme Olympias. Background In 264 BC the states of Carthage and Rome went to war, starting the First Punic War. Carthage was a well-established maritime power in the Western Mediterranean; Rome had recently unified mainland Italy south of the Arno River under its control. Rome's expansion into southern Italy probably made it inevitable that it would eventually clash with Carthage over Sicily on some pretext. The immediate cause of the war was the issue of control of the Sicilian town of Messana (modern Messina). By 256 BC the war had grown into a struggle in which the Romans were attempting to decisively defeat the Carthaginians and, at a minimum, control the whole of Sicily. The Carthaginians were engaging in their traditional policy of waiting for their opponents to wear themselves out, in the expectation of then regaining some or all of their possessions and negotiating a mutually satisfactory peace treaty. The Romans were essentially a land-based power and had gained control of most of Sicily. The war there had reached a stalemate, as the Carthaginians focused on defending their well-fortified towns and cities; these were mostly on the coast and so could be supplied and reinforced without the Romans being able to use their superior army to interfere. The focus of the war shifted to the sea, where the Romans had little experience; on the few occasions they had previously felt the need for a naval presence they relied on small squadrons provided by their allies. In 260 BC Romans set out to construct a fleet using a shipwrecked Carthaginian quinquereme as a blueprint for their own ships. Frustration at the continuing stalemate in the land war on Sicily, combined with naval victories at Mylae (260 BC) and Sulci (258 BC), led the Romans to develop a plan to invade the Carthaginian heartland in North Africa and threaten their capital (close to what is now Tunis). Both sides were determined to establish naval supremacy and invested large amounts of money and manpower in maintaining and increasing the size of their navies. It was the long-standing Roman procedure to appoint two men each year, known as consuls, to each lead an army. The Roman fleet of 330 warships plus an unknown number of transports sailed from Ostia, the port of Rome, in early 256 BC, jointly commanded by both consuls for the year, Marcus Atilius Regulus and Lucius Manlius Vulso Longus. They embarked approximately 26,000 legionaries from the Roman forces on Sicily. The Carthaginians were aware of the Romans' intentions and mustered all available warships, 350, under Hanno and Hamilcar, off the south coast of Sicily to intercept them. With a combined total of about 680 warships carrying as many as 290,000 crew and marines, the battle was possibly the largest naval battle in history by the number of combatants involved. When they met at the Battle of Cape Ecnomus, the Carthaginians took the initiative, hoping their superior ship-handling skills would be decisive. After a prolonged and confused day of fighting the Carthaginians were defeated, losing 30 ships sunk and 64 captured to Roman losses of 24 ships sunk. Prelude thumbupright=1leftalt=a map of what is now north-east Tunisia, showing the advance, main military clashes and retreat of the invading Roman army in 256‚Äì255 BC1: Romans land and capture Aspis (256 BC) 2: Roman victory at Adys (256 BC) 3: Romans capture Tunis (256 BC) 4: Xanthippus sets out from Carthage with a large army (255 BC) 5: Romans are defeated at the Battle of the Bagradas River. (255 BC) 6: Romans retreat to Aspis and leave Africa. (255 BC) As a result of the battle, the Roman army, commanded by Regulus and Longus, landed in Africa near Aspis (modern Kelibia) on the Cape Bon Peninsula and began ravaging the Carthaginian countryside for supplies to feed their 90,000 rowers and crew, and 26,000 legionaries. They captured 20,000 slaves, vast herds of cattle, and after a brief siege the city of Aspis. The Roman Senate sent orders for most of the Roman ships and a large part of the army to return to Sicily under Longus, probably due to the logistical difficulties of supplying more than 100,000 men over the winter. Regulus was left with 40 ships, 15,000 infantry and 500 cavalry to overwinter in Africa. Regulus was an experienced military commander, having been consul in 267 BC, when he was awarded a triumph for his victory against the Salentini. His orders were to weaken the Carthaginian army pending reinforcement in the spring. It was expected he would achieve this by raids and by fomenting rebellion among Carthage's subject territories, but consuls had wide discretion. Regulus chose to take his relatively small force and strike inland. He advanced on the city of Adys, south-east of Carthage, and besieged it. The Carthaginians, meanwhile, had recalled Hamilcar from Sicily with 5,000 infantry and 500 cavalry. Hamilcar and two previously unknown generals named Hasdrubal and Bostar were placed in joint command of an army which was strong in cavalry and elephants and was approximately the same size as the Roman force. The Carthaginians established a camp on a hill near Adys. The Romans carried out a night march and launched a surprise dawn attack on the camp from two directions. After confused fighting the Carthaginians broke and fled. Their losses are unknown, although their elephants and cavalry escaped with few casualties. The Romans followed up and captured numerous towns, including Tunis, only from Carthage. From Tunis the Romans raided and devastated the immediate area around Carthage. Many of Carthage's African possessions took the opportunity to rise in revolt. The city of Carthage was packed with refugees fleeing Regulus or the rebels, and food ran out. In despair, according to most ancient sources, the Carthaginians sued for peace. Polybius differs in stating that Regulus initiated the negotiations, hoping to receive the glory of ending the war before his successors arrived to replace him. In either case Regulus, within sight of what he took to be a thoroughly defeated Carthage, demanded harsh terms: Carthage was to hand over Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica; pay all of Rome's war expenses; pay tribute to Rome each year; be prohibited from declaring war or making peace without Roman permission; have its navy limited to a single warship; but provide 50 large warships to the Romans on their request. Finding these completely unacceptable, the Carthaginians decided to fight on. Armies Most male Roman citizens were eligible for military service and would serve as infantry, a better-off minority providing a cavalry component. Traditionally, when at war the Romans would raise two legions, each of 4,200 infantry and 300 cavalry. A few infantry served as javelin-armed skirmishers. The balance were equipped as heavy infantry, with body armour, a large shield and short thrusting swords. They were divided into three ranks, of which the front rank also carried two javelins, while the second and third ranks had a thrusting spear instead. Both legionary sub-units and individual legionaries fought in relatively open order. An army was usually formed by combining a Roman legion with a similarly sized and equipped legion provided by their Latin allies. It is not clear how the 15,000 infantry at the Bagradas River were constituted, but they possibly represented four slightly under-strength legions: two Roman and two allied. Regulus did not attract any troops from the towns and cities rebelling against Carthage. In this he differed from other generals, including Roman ones, leading armies against Carthage in Africa. The reasons for this are not known. In particular, the difficulty in transporting horses had restricted his cavalry force to only 500, and his failure to make up this deficiency is puzzling. Carthaginian citizens served in their army only if there was a direct threat to the city. When they did they fought as well- armoured heavy infantry armed with long thrusting spears, although they were notoriously ill-trained and ill-disciplined. In most circumstances Carthage recruited foreigners to make up its army. Many would be from North Africa which provided several types of fighters including: close-order infantry equipped with large shields, helmets, short swords and long thrusting spears; javelin-armed light infantry skirmishers; close-order shock cavalry carrying spears; and light cavalry skirmishers who threw javelins from a distance and avoided close combat. Both Spain and Gaul provided small numbers of experienced infantry; unarmoured troops who would charge ferociously, but had a reputation for breaking off if a combat was protracted. The close order Libyan infantry and the citizen-militia would fight in a tightly packed formation known as a phalanx. Slingers were frequently recruited from the Balearic Islands, although it is not clear if any were present at Tunis. The Carthaginians also employed war elephants; North Africa had indigenous African forest elephants at the time. Xanthippus The Carthaginians were recruiting fighting men from all over the Mediterranean region, and at around this time a large group of recruits from Greece arrived in Carthage. Among them was a Spartan mercenary commander, Xanthippus. Polybius states he had taken part in Spartan training methods and that he knew both how to deploy and how to manoeuvre an army. He made a good impression with the troops of the Carthaginian army, and was able to persuade the Carthaginian Senate that the strongest elements of their army were their cavalry and elephants and that to be deployed to best effect they needed to fight on open level ground. The historian John Lazenby speculates he may have previously faced elephants when Pyrrhus of Epirus attacked Sparta in the 270s BC. Xanthippus was put in charge of training over the winter, although a committee of Carthaginian generals retained operational control. As the prospect of a decisive battle drew nearer, and as Xanthippus's skill at manoeuvring the army became more evident, full control was given to him. Whether this was a decision of the Senate, the generals, or was forced on them by the wishes of the troops, who included many Carthaginian citizens, is not clear. Battle Xanthippus led the army of 100 elephants, 4,000 cavalry and 12,000 infantrythe latter included the 5,000 veterans from Sicily and many citizen-militiaout of Carthage and set up camp close to the Romans in an area of open plain. The precise site is not known, but it is assumed to be close to Tunis. The Roman army of about 15,000 infantry and 500 cavalry advanced to meet them, and set up camp about away. The next morning both sides deployed for battle. Xanthippus placed the Carthaginian citizen-militia in the centre of his formation; with the Sicilian veterans and the freshly hired infantry divided on either side of them; and with the cavalry equally divided on either side of these. The elephants were deployed in a single line in front of the centre of the infantry. The Romans placed their legionary infantry in their centre, arranged in a deeper and denser formation than usual. Polybius considered this to be an effective anti- elephant formation, but points out that it shortened the frontage of the Roman infantry and made them liable to being out-flanked. Light infantry skirmishers were positioned in front of the legions, and the 500 cavalry were divided between the flanks. Regulus apparently hoped to punch through the elephants with his massed infantry, overcome the Carthaginian phalanx in their centre and so win the battle before he needed to worry about being attacked on the flanks. The battle opened with attacks by the Carthaginian cavalry and elephants. The Roman cavalry, hopelessly outnumbered, were soon swept away. The Roman legionaries advanced, shouting and banging their sword hilts on their shields in an attempt to deter the elephants. Part of the Roman left overlapped the line of elephants, and they charged the infantry of the Carthaginian right, who broke and fled back to their camp, pursued by the Romans. This part of the Roman force probably consisted of Latin allies. The rest of the Roman infantry had difficulties with the elephants, who were not deterred by their noise but charged home, inflicting casualties and considerable confusion. At least some of the legionaries fought their way through the line of elephants, and attacked the Carthaginian phalanx. But they were too disordered to fight effectively and the phalanx held firm. Some units of the Carthaginian cavalry were now returning from their pursuit and started to attack or feint against the Roman rear and flanks. The Romans attempted to fight on all sides which brought their forward momentum to a halt. The Romans held firm, possibly partly because of the way their dense formation jammed them close together, but the elephants continued to rampage through their ranks, and the Carthaginian cavalry pinned them in place by hurling missiles into their rear and flanks. Then Xanthippus ordered the phalanx to attack. Most of the Romans were packed into a space where they could not resist effectively and were slaughtered. Regulus and a small force fought their way out of the encirclement, but were pursued and shortly he and 500 survivors were forced to surrender. A total of about 13,000 Romans were killed. The Carthaginians lost 800 men from the force on their right which was routed; the losses of the rest of their army are not known. A force of 2,000 Romans survived, from the left wing who had broken through into the Carthaginian camp; they escaped the battlefield and retreated to Aspis. This was Carthage's only victory in a major land battle during the war. Aftermath Xanthippus, fearful of the envy of the Carthaginian generals he had outdone, took his pay and returned to Greece. Regulus died in Carthaginian captivity; later Roman authors invented a tale of him displaying heroic virtue while a prisoner. The Romans sent a fleet to evacuate their survivors and the Carthaginians attempted to oppose it. In the resulting Battle of Cape Hermaeum off Africa the Carthaginians were heavily defeated, losing 114 ships captured and 16 sunk. The Roman fleet, in turn, was devastated by a storm while returning to Italy, 384 ships having been sunk from their total of 464 and 100,000 men lost,the majority non-Roman Latin allies. The war continued for a further 14 years, mostly on Sicily or the nearby waters, before ending with a Roman victory; the terms offered to Carthage were more generous than those proposed by Regulus. The question of which state was to control the western Mediterranean remained open, and their relationship was tense. When Carthage besieged the Roman-protected town of Saguntum in eastern Iberia in 218 BC, it ignited the Second Punic War with Rome.

Its name was a pun on the name of the famous Hanna-Barbera blue dog character Huckleberry Hound (\\"Roquet Belles Oreilles\\" in French). The group was formed in 1981. The original lineup consisted of Guy A. Lepage, Yves P. Pelletier, Bruno E. Landry, Andr√© G. Ducharme, Richard Z. Sirois and Chantal Francke. Sirois left the group in 1987, and Francke left in 1992. The group separated in 1995. RBO specialized in performing parodies of well-known advertisements, TV shows and movies, as well as impersonating politicians, showbiz stars and various famous people. They quickly became known for being highly politically incorrect. Many of their sketches poked fun at English Canadians, though this was counterbalanced by making fun of Quebec nationalists and political icons such as Ren√© L√©vesque as well. They also caused a few scandals with sketches involving feces, super- Jesus, dildos or the Holocaust. One of their most famous recurring sketches, \\"Bonjour la police\\", was about police officers who were always eating doughnuts and coffee at Dunkin' Donuts instead of working; a song written by the group (also titled \\"Bonjour la police\\") was based on these sketches. Team member Guy A. Lepage became in the early 2000s a media mogul and TV series director, very popular on the Quebec entertainment scene, with popular series such as the sitcom Un gars, une fille and the talk-show Tout le monde en parle, based on a popular French TV show with the same title. Most other members were stand-up comics or talk-show hosts in the early 2000s.

It lies in a region of continental terrain between Mare Imbrium to the south and Mare Frigoris to the north. This crater is bowl- shaped, with a small interior floor at the midpoint and a somewhat eroded outer rim. In 2000, the IAU named this feature after Nathaniel Bliss, the 4th Astronomer Royal. He was the only remaining Astronomer Royal who had not until then received the honor of a named feature or astronomical body. (This revision was announced by the XXIVth general assembly of the IAU, on August 15, 2000.) This new name for the feature was originally suggested by Patrick Moore. Note that a bulletin announcing the name of this crater described it as a ghost crater that lies between Plato and Mons Piton to the south. However this was due to a mix-up, and Bliss is actually the crater formerly known as Plato A.

This success was a flagship of Margaret Thatcher's privatisation programme. He was also directly involved with the \\"dirty tricks\\" campaign waged by British Airways, against Virgin Atlantic. Early life and career King was born in Brentford, Middlesex. His father Albert had fought in the First World War, and later worked as a postman; his Irish mother Kathleen worked as a seamstress. He was the second of four children. He was reared on a small property attached to a public house in Dunsfold, Surrey. He left school in 1929 at the age of 12 without qualifications and started work in a local factory which produced vacuum cleaners, where his work included machining clamping stays, earning him the nickname \\"Clamping Stay King\\". His next job was with local businessman Arthur Sykes, as a car salesman (with duties including re-possessing cars from people who had failed to make the necessary payments) before setting up his own taxi business and acquiring a Ford cars sub-agency and naming it Whitehouse Motors. When the second World War broke out, the motor business folded, but by then King had diversified into more general engineering work and so prospered from defence contracts and making parts for aircraft. He benefited hugely from War Ministry contracts and was able to use rare American machine tools that he acquired under the Lend Lease programme. After the war King moved to Canada for a time, before returning to England and building a factory on wasteland in Ferrybridge, Yorkshire to establish Ferrybridge Industries. After renaming it the Pollard Ball and Roller Bearing Company and producing millions of ball bearings per year, it grew to become a major operation spanning several continents (the third- largest ball-bearing business in the UK). After being forced to merge the business with another manufacturer, Ransome & Marles, as part of a government reorganisation of the ball bearing business, King sold it for ¬£10m in 1968, netting some ¬£3m personally. He became Chairman of Dennis Specialist Vehicles in 1970, and Babcock International in 1972. Babcock was acquired by FKI Electricals for ¬£415 million in August 1987. King, Babcock chairman since 1972, became chairman of the new combined company, called FKI Babcock. He was knighted in 1979, and appointed Chairman of the National Enterprise Board in 1980 and, famously, taking over as head of British Airways (BA). British Airways Dubbed \\"Mrs. Thatcher's favourite businessman\\" he was chosen to prepare the loss-making nationalised flag carrier for privatisation. King joined British Airways in 1981 when the airline was losing in excess of ¬£140m a year. By 1989, the airline was making a pre-tax profit of ¬£268m. Some of King's major changes at the airline included removing 22,000 staff members, hiring Colin Marshall as CEO in 1983, removing older aircraft from the fleet, purchasing more modern and efficient airliners, and axing unprofitable routes. Within two years King had replaced over half of the BA board with his own appointees. When BA was privatised in 1987, the initial share offering was 11 times oversubscribed. His compensation as chairman rose from about ¬£250,000 in 1988 to ¬£669,350 (including a ¬£220,000 bonus) in 1991. King was created a life peer as Baron King of Wartnaby, of Wartnaby in the County of Leicestershire on 15 July 1983. Lord King recognised the importance of Concorde to British Airways. In its early years of service with BA, Concorde lost the carrier money and attracted criticism from the press as a white elephant. BA used Concorde to win business customers from transatlantic competitors by guaranteeing a certain number of Concorde upgrades in return for corporate accounts with the airline. Virgin Atlantic and the \\"Dirty Tricks\\" Scandal Around the same time, British Airways was witnessing the emergence of rival; Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic which began with one route and one Boeing 747 in 1984, and was emerging as a serious threat on some of BA's most lucrative routes. Following a highly publicised mercy mission to Iraq to fly home hostages who had been held by Saddam Hussein in 1991,\\"Branson achieves another media coup\\", Simon Midgley, 11 December 1993, The Independent King is reported to have told Marshall and his PA Director David Burnside to \\"do something about Branson\\".\\"Row over dirty tricks led to decade of hostilities\\", Lee Glendinning, 2 August 2007, The Guardian This began the campaign of \\"dirty tricks\\", for which Branson sued King and BA for libel in 1992. King countersued Branson with the case scheduled for trial in 1993. However, it was settled out of court, with BA paying damages to Branson of ¬£500,000 and a further ¬£110,000 to his airline; further, BA paid legal fees of up to ¬£3 million.\\"1993: BA dirty tricks against Virgin cost ¬£3m\\" BBC News Later career King stepped down from his BA leadership role in 1993, but remained BA president emeritus. His interests included directorships at the Daily Telegraph, Spectator, headhunting company Norman Broadbent, and engineering firm Short Brothers. However, it can be said that until the end he remained passionate about his \\"ugly duckling that became the world's favourite airline.\\" Marriage and children King was married twice; first to Lorna Sykes (daughter of his first boss Arthur Sykes and sister-in-law of John Poulson) in 1941. The couple remained married until her death from cancer in 1969. King remarried in 1970 to the Hon Isabel Monckton, daughter of 8th Viscount Galway. Personal life A keen huntsman from an early age, King held the rank of MFH (Master of Foxhounds) with the Belvoir and Badsworth hunts and was also Chairman of the Lord King XI cricket team. He and wife Lorna both learnt to fly and they would use an aircraft to tour the UK and drum up business. Lord King kept a flat in London for many years, in Eaton Square, and during his time running British Airways he lived there during the week full-time. At weekends, he travelled north to his country estate, Friars Well Estate, in Wartnaby near Melton Mowbray in the county of Leicestershire. He also had a house in Scotland, close to the River Naver, where he pursued his love of fly fishing.

The total cost of the G1 development was well several times the annual profits of Toyoda. The G1 was sold as a Toyoda. The company changed its name from Toyoda to Toyota at the introduction of the G1's successor, the GA. Since this was Toyoda's first production vehicle, there were still many problems to be solved. When the first production examples were driven to Tokyo for the motor show, they were packed with many spare parts. These spare parts were in case something broke during the trip - luckily only a few replacement parts were required. Early sales were mostly to people who were sympathetic to local manufacturers and who were willing to endure many failures. To support them, design engineers from the factory were often sent to do repairs in order to learn which parts needed the most attention. For example, broken rear axle housings were common until new welding methods were developed. Repairs were done for free and sometimes entire trucks were replaced for free. Rectifications were then applied as running changes on the production line, reflecting Toyota's \\"5 Whys\\" problem solving philosophy. =Dates= The G1 prototypes were completed in August 1935, shown to the public in November 1935 and released for sale in December 1935.

The KC truck was used on Japanese military airfields to start aircraft engines. A power take-off was taken from after the gearbox. It rose behind the cabin and then projected forward. This was mated to the spinner on an aircraft's propeller to start the aircraft engine. Because it wasn't used for heavy cargo, the cargo bed was narrow and the rear wheels were singles instead of the normal doubles. Also, the cabin was very basic, having plywood sides, no doors and a canvas roof. Running boards were unique to the starter truck due to the narrow cargo bed.

She served as a junior minister in the Labour‚ÄìLiberal Democrat coalition Scottish Executive from 2004 until the coalition's defeat by the Scottish National Party (SNP) in 2007. She was subsequently elected Deputy Leader of the Scottish Labour Party in 2008, and was elected to the leadership in December 2011. She announced her resignation in October 2014. In addition to her ministerial and leadership roles, she has been a campaigner on equality issues and violence against women throughout her political career. Born in Glasgow, Lamont attended Woodside Secondary School and obtained a degree from the University of Glasgow. After studying for teaching qualifications at Jordanhill College, she became a schoolteacher. Active in the Labour Party since she was at university, Lamont served on its Scottish Executive Committee, and chaired it in 1993. With the establishment of a devolved legislature in Scotland, she was elected as the Labour Co-operative Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Glasgow Pollok in 1999. Having been appointed convener of the Scottish Parliament's Social Justice Committee in 2001, she obtained her first ministerial role in October 2004. Lamont stood for the Scottish Labour leadership following the resignation of Iain Gray in the wake of the party's defeat at the 2011 Scottish parliamentary election; its second consecutive defeat. Following a review of how the Labour Party in Scotland would be structured, she became its first overall leader. She stated Labour lost the 2011 election because it had lost direction, and initiated a review of Scottish Labour policy on issues like devolution and the party's commitment to free universal public services. Following the SNP Government's announcement of a referendum on Scottish independence, she was a key figure in the Better Together campaign; a cross- party movement that sought to keep Scotland part of the United Kingdom. She resigned as Scottish Labour leader in October 2014, making the announcement in a Daily Record interview in which she claimed that senior figures within the UK Labour Party had undermined her attempts to reform the Scottish party, and treated it \\"like a branch office of London\\". Following a leadership election to replace her, was succeeded by former Secretary of State for Scotland Jim Murphy in December 2014. Lamont's work as Scottish Labour leader won her accolades at the Scottish Politician of the Year Awards, for Political Impact of the Year in 2012 and Debater of the Year in 2013. In parliamentary debates, she was perceived by commentators such as The Scotsmans Andrew Whitaker as being an effective opponent to First Minister Alex Salmond, but others, including Richard Seymour of The Guardian, criticised her for clumsiness during television interviews. Early life and teaching career Johann MacDougall Lamont was born in the Anderston district of Glasgow on 11 July 1957. Her parents, Archie and Effie, were both Gaelic speakers from crofting families on the Inner Hebridean island of Tiree, who met after both had moved to Glasgow. Archie was a carpenter employed by the Scottish ferry operator Caledonian MacBrayne, working on the Mallaig to Skye route. He took part in the Seamen's Strike of 1966. The family were Presbyterians, and Lamont's mother was influenced in her faith by the American evangelist Billy Graham. Her first experiences of public speakers was listening to the preachers her mother took her to see as a girl. Lamont's childhood was divided between Glasgow and her mother's family home on Tiree, where she and her brother David spent their summer holidays. She attended Woodside Secondary School, having declined to take scholarship exams for selective education. Like her parents, she was a Gaelic speaker, but she did not believe she spoke it well enough, and she dropped it at school in favour of French and German. It was also at school that she first developed an interest in politics, once entering a Daily Mirror competition with a politically-themed short story. The tale, whose central character discussed her intention to demand a pay rise and was finally revealed to be the Queen, won Lamont third prize. She studied English and History at the University of Glasgow, graduating with an MA. Joining the Labour Party in 1975, she was active in the Glasgow University Labour Club where she was a contemporary of fellow Labour politician Margaret Curran, and was also involved with the women's movement. She trained as a teacher for a year at Jordanhill College, gaining a Postgraduate Certificate in Education, and afterwards joined Rothesay Academy, Isle of Bute, as a teacher in 1979. She taught at Springburn Academy in Glasgow from 1982 to 1989 and at Castlemilk High School, also in Glasgow, from 1990 to 1999. Lamont taught English and worked with social workers and educational psychologists attempting to tackle instances of school truancy. Continuing to be active in the Labour Party, Lamont became a prominent campaigner on issues related to social justice, equality and devolution. Although she had voted no in the 1979 referendum that proposed the establishment of a Scottish Assembly, during the 1980s and 1990s she was a representative on the Scottish Constitutional Convention, the body that paved the way for Scottish devolution. Of her 1979 decision, Lamont has said that she \\"came from the strand on the left which saw the politics of nationalism as a diversion from more central aims [but later] came to see the parliament as a vehicle for democratic change in Scotland.\\" She was a member of the Scottish Executive Committee of the Labour Party, serving as chair in 1993. MSP for Glasgow Pollok Although a Labour activist for two decades, Lamont had not sought election to the House of Commons during that time, telling a 2014 BBC interview there were few chances for women to be elected to Westminster: \\"In 1987 Labour sent down 50 MPs and only one of them was a woman.\\" Instead, her decision to seek political office was influenced by the creation of the Scottish Parliament. Speaking to The Herald in 2011, she said, \\"It is easy to forget what a great opportunity it was for women and I was determined that women would be represented, would have a strong voice.\\" The parliament was established as a result of the 1997 referendum that saw a 74% vote in favour of devolving legislative powers to Scotland. Lamont was first elected as the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Glasgow Pollok in 1999. She held the seat in 2003, when she faced a strong challenge from the Scottish Socialist Party leader Tommy Sheridan, and then again in 2007 and 2011. During her maiden speech on 17 May 1999, Lamont was the first MSP to use Gaelic at a sitting of the Parliament. She served on a number of the Parliament's committees during her first term in office, including the Equal Opportunities Committee, the Local Government Committee and the Social Justice Committee. She became convener of the Social Justice Committee in 2001. In 2000 she became the first Labour MSP to rebel against the Labour-led administration when she threatened to lead backbenchers in voting against a planned Scottish Executive attempt to block the Abolition of Poindings and Warrant Sales Bill, which had been introduced by Sheridan. The move resulted in the withdrawal of the amendment, and a crucial parliamentary vote in favour of the legislation. At a session of First Minister's Questions in 2002, she narrowly avoided becoming the first MSP to be ejected from the parliament after continuing to speak when Presiding Officer David Steel had told her to sit down. Steel felt her supplementary question about youth crime was too long, but the incident led to a heated parliamentary debate, and accusations from Lamont's colleague, Labour's Helen Eadie that the Presiding Officer was not treating male and female MSPs equally, an allegation he rejected. Frontbench politics Lamont was appointed convener of the Communities Committee in 2003. In March 2004 the Committee endorsed a bill aimed at tackling antisocial behaviour, which included plans for parenting orders and the electronic tagging of youths under the age of 16. First Minister Jack McConnell made her Deputy Minister for Communities in the Scottish Executive in October 2004. In that post she was responsible for the launch of a radio and television advertising campaign aimed at tackling domestic abuse that aired over Christmas 2005, and she expressed concerns over the level of discrimination faced by travellers and gypsies after the issue was highlighted in a 2005 Scottish Parliament report. In November 2006, Lamont was appointed Deputy Minister for Justice and oversaw reforms to Scotland's Lower Courts system. She held the post until Labour was defeated at the 2007 election. McConnell appointed her as Labour's spokesperson for Communities and Sport in his post-election frontbench team, a role she retained in the shadow cabinet formed by his successor, Wendy Alexander, in September 2007. Following Alexander's decision to step down as leader of the Labour MSPs in June 2008, and Cathy Jamieson's subsequent resignation as her deputy, Lamont stood against fellow MSP Bill Butler for the position vacated by Jamieson. She was elected as deputy leader in September 2008 with 60.16 percent of the vote, against 39.82 percent for Butler. At the same time, Iain Gray was elected to lead the Labour group at Holyrood. In addition to her deputy leadership role, Lamont was appointed Chief of Staff with special responsibility for Equalities. While in that post she gave her support to Scottish Government plans to introduce a Bill outlawing forced marriage, which was announced in September 2010. In February 2011, she criticised Scottish Conservative MSP and Justice Committee Convener, Bill Aitken after the Sunday Herald quoted him making a controversial statement about a rape victim, and later welcomed his subsequent resignation. As Gray's deputy Lamont also represented Labour at First Minister's Questions in his absence. At a session of First Minister's Questions in October 2009, she raised the issue of the Scottish Futures Trust with Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, asking whether the public body planned to spend any money on improving school infrastructure before the 2011 election. Leader of the Scottish Labour Party =Leadership election= Official parliamentary portrait, 2011In the wake of Labour's second defeat at the Scottish Parliament election of May 2011, which saw the Scottish National Party (SNP) form its first majority government, Gray announced his intention to step down as leader of the Labour MSPs later that year. A review chaired by Jim Murphy and Sarah Boyack into the party's structure in Scotland subsequently concluded that the next leader should lead the entire Scottish Labour Party rather than just its MSPs, as previous leaders had. Lamont declared her candidacy for the leadership election in September 2011 and launched her campaign on 7 November at Stirling University. She told delegates that Labour needed to reengage with the electorate if it wanted to govern again: \\"We must listen and learn, show humility and seek again to talk for and to people's ambitions and concerns. Our real challenge is that we in Labour lost our way, lost our confidence and lost Scotland.\\" Lamont's opponents in the leadership race were the MP Tom Harris, and her fellow MSP Ken Macintosh, both of whom had also expressed a need for Labour to change if it was to win the next election. Harris's campaign centred on the belief that Labour had to \\"[re-establish] itself as the party of aspiration\\", or it would risk becoming \\"an irrelevance\\". Macintosh felt the party had focused too heavily on its traditional support in the Central Belt while paying less attention to rural communities. He suggested increasing government help to tackle unemployment among young people, and wanted to nationalise rail and bus services. The result of the election was announced on 17 December 2011 and saw Lamont secure an overall majority with 51.77% of the vote in the first round. Her closest rival was Macintosh with 40.28%, while Harris was third with 7.95%. Lamont also won majorities in two groups of Labour's three-tier electoral college system, securing the support of parliamentarians and affiliated bodies such as trade unions. Macintosh was backed by the majority of individual party members. In her acceptance speech, Lamont told party activists, \\"Together we will change the Scottish Labour Party and win the chance to serve the people of Scotland again and make Scotland all that we know it can be.\\" On the same day, MP Anas Sarwar was elected to the position of Deputy that Lamont had vacated. =Shadow Cabinet= Lamont began appointing members of her shadow cabinet on 19 December 2011. Those given positions on her initial frontbench team include Macintosh (Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Employment and Sustainable Growth), Hugh Henry (Labour spokesman for Education and Lifelong Learning), Lewis Macdonald (Shadow Justice Minister) and Boyack (Local Government and Planning). The post of Shadow Health Minister was given to Jackie Baillie, who had held the position previously. Gray was not included, as he had expressed a wish to take a break from frontline politics. Lamont announced a major shakeup of the Labour frontbench team on 28 June 2013. Gray returned to replace Macintosh as the party's finance spokesman. Macdonald was appointed chief whip, and his previous role as Shadow Justice Minister was given to Graeme Pearson. Baillie was moved from Health to Social Justice and Welfare. Boyack kept her role in Local Government and Planning. Speaking about the reshuffle, Lamont said, \\"We have made a great deal of progress in the last 18 months but we have to keep moving forward.\\" =First months in office= Lamont gave her first post-election interview to The Politics Show Scotland on 18 December 2011, speaking of the \\"huge challenge\\" of rebuilding public trust in Scottish Labour after its election defeat of the previous May, and a general decline in support over the preceding decade. Attributing the party's losses to its failure to engage with the electorate, she told the programme that Labour needed to speak up for the interests of the Scottish people, and accept more devolved powers for the Scottish Parliament. Attending her first session of First Minister's Questions as Labour leader on 22 December 2011, she addressed the issue of child neglect following the conviction of a Glasgow woman for the murder of her son and asking what lessons could be learned from the case. In January 2012, as the SNP Government prepared for a referendum on Scottish independence, she spoke out in defence of Scotland's position in the United Kingdom after First Minister Salmond claimed that the country was not an equal partner in the union. Along with Ruth Davidson and Willie Rennie, the respective leaders of the Scottish Conservatives and the Scottish Liberal Democrats, and Deputy First Minister Sturgeon, Lamont added her signature to a February 2012 letter urging Glasgow City Council to decline an application by the Scottish Defence League to stage a march through the city. The group, an offshoot of the far-right English Defence League, subsequently withdrew their application, and a \\"static\\" demonstration was held instead. Lamont gave her first conference speech as party leader at Scottish Labour's conference in March 2012, setting out an agenda for rebuilding confidence in the party. Later the same month she welcomed the passing of the Scotland Bill, which devolved further powers to Scotland in accordance with the recommendations of the Calman Commission, praising it as \\"an important development of devolution\\". In May 2012 she participated in the Scottish Parliament debate paying tribute to Queen Elizabeth as the UK celebrated her Diamond Jubilee. Lamont commented, \\"60 years in the one job is good going ‚Äì I've been in this one for just six months and some days, I have to say, it feels like 60 years ‚Äì so we recognise the scale of the achievement of the particular, very strong woman.\\" Lamont was a guest on the 7 June 2012 edition of the BBC's political debate programme Question Time. =Standing in the polls= A poll conducted by Ipsos MORI in December 2011 as Lamont took control of Scottish Labour indicated that the party had an approval rating of 26%, almost half that of the Scottish National Party with 51%. A survey by the same organisation in June 2012 showed an improvement for Labour, with 32% against the Nationalists' 45%. The same poll indicated a personal approval rating for Lamont of 9%, compared to 13% for Salmond. A poll conducted by Ipsos MORI on behalf of STV in September 2013 indicated that 37% of respondents were satisfied with Labour's performance compared to 41% for the SNP. That survey found that Lamont had a personal approval rating of +6%, against +8% for Salmond. Another Ipsos MORI poll for STV in December 2013 showed Labour on 34% with 36% for the SNP, while Lamont had overtaken Salmond in terms of personal approval with +9 for her compared to +7 for the First Minister. A poll on the issue of Scottish independence conducted by TNS-BMRB in December 2013 gave Lamont an approval rating of 6% among women and 8% among men, compared with 22% and 30% respectively for Salmond. 41% of respondents to that survey were unaware of her role as Scottish Labour leader, a figure rising to 62% among those aged 16‚Äì34. =Local elections and by-elections= Lamont launched Labour's 2012 local election campaign in Edinburgh on 17 April 2012, setting out policies for creating employment and training opportunities as well as improvements to education and childcare. Claiming that the SNP Government had passed on 89 percent of the spending cuts imposed by the UK Government, she compared the Nationalists to the businessman criticised for his role in the financial collapse of Glasgow Rangers Football Club, saying, \\"Putting the SNP in charge of a council is like putting Craig Whyte in charge of your tax return.\\" Retaining control of Glasgow City Council, where Labour was facing a strong challenge from the SNP, was another of the party's key objectives. After the polls, political academic John Curtice, writing for The Guardian, observed that Lamont \\"has undoubtedly done enough to dispel doubts about whether she was the right woman for the job\\". The 2013 Dunfermline by-election was triggered by the resignation of the SNP's Bill Walker in the wake of his conviction on several accounts of domestic abuse. On the eve of the poll, Alan Cochrane of The Daily Telegraph described it as an election Labour could not afford to lose because, \\"For [Lamont's] personal prestige, her candidate simply must win.\\" Labour won the seat with a swing of 7 percent from the SNP and a majority of 2,873. Lamont said that the result reflected \\"the progress we've made\\", but Curtice said that if the results were repeated across Scotland, the SNP would still be the majority party at the next election. Labour also increased their support at other by-elections. At the 2013 Aberdeen Donside by-election in June, held after the death of the SNP's Brian Adam, Labour reduced the SNP majority from 7,789 to 2,025. The 2014 Cowdenbeath by-election was held following the death of Labour MSP Helen Eadie. The campaign was fought on issues such as education, employment and care for the elderly, and saw Labour increase their share of the vote, with an 11.25 percent swing from the SNP and a majority of 5,488. =Scottish independence and enhanced devolution= Lamont (second from right) alongside Anas Sarwar, Gordon Brown and Margaret Curran at the launch of United with Labour Lamont was a prominent figure in the Better Together Campaign, the cross-party political movement founded to keep Scotland as part of the United Kingdom following the SNP's announcement of a referendum on Scottish independence in 2014. She was outspoken in her opposition to Scottish independence, using a keynote speech at UK Labour's 2013 conference in Brighton to accuse the SNP of nurturing hostility between Scotland and the rest of the UK, and describing nationalism as a \\"virus that has affected so many nations and done so much harm\\". Lamont is in favour of greater devolved powers for the Scottish Parliament, and established a Commission to look at how this can be achieved. 2014 referendum and Better Together campaign After taking office as Labour leader in December 2011, Lamont urged First Minister Salmond to set a date for the referendum, arguing in her leadership acceptance speech that uncertainty over the referendum's timeline was having a negative impact on Scotland. On 10 January 2012 Salmond announced late 2014 as his preferred time for a referendum. The Scottish Government confirmed the referendum question on 25 January 2012, and announced on 21 March 2013 that the referendum would be held on 18 September 2014. Lamont told Scottish Labour's 2012 annual conference she wanted her party's campaign to be one of \\"collective leadership\\" against independence, a strategy which she envisaged would become a cross-party movement arguing the case for keeping Scotland in the UK. At the Scottish Conservative Party conference a few weeks later, party leader Ruth Davidson called for Lamont and her opponents to work together. The Better Together Campaign, fronted by former UK Government minister Alistair Darling, was launched at an event attended by Lamont and other senior Scottish political figures at Edinburgh's Napier University on 25 June 2012. Along with former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and other senior Scottish Labour figures, Lamont launched the party's own pro-union campaign, United with Labour in May 2013. The Scottish Government published Scotland's Future, a white paper setting out its vision for an independent Scotland, on 26 November 2013. Lamont dismissed it as \\"670 pages of assertion and uncertainty\\". Addressing the Shadow Cabinet of UK Labour leader Ed Miliband on 28 January 2014, Lamont warned that Scots could vote for independence if they believed Labour was unlikely to win the 2015 UK general election. Opinion polls showed an increase in support for the Yes campaign as the referendum approached. On 8 September 2014, Gordon Brown set out plans for greater devolved powers for Holyrood in the event of a No vote. Lamont joined Ruth Davidson and Willie Rennie in giving her backing to the proposals the following day, but Salmond dismissed them as \\"a retreading, a repackaging, a re-timetabling\\" of previous promises. Prime Minister David Cameron and Opposition leader Ed Miliband cancelled their appearance at Prime Minister's Questions to travel to Scotland to campaign for a No vote. On 18 September, Scotland voted to reject independence with a majority of 2,001,926 to 1,617,989. Salmond announced his intention to resign as First Minister and SNP leader on 19 September, shortly after the result of the referendum was confirmed. Lamont paid tribute to him, describing him as \\"an immense figure in Scottish political history\\". Sturgeon was chosen to succeed Salmond as SNP leader on 15 October. Labour's Commission on devolution At the Scottish Labour Party Conference in March 2012, Lamont announced her intention to establish a Commission to examine the prospect of a fully devolved Scottish Parliament. This would give the Scottish Government the power to make decisions on policies relating to issues such as welfare benefits, income tax and corporation tax, effectively making it a fully self-governing region of the United Kingdom. The Commission, chaired by Lamont and including politicians, academics and trade union members, met for the first time in October 2012. It published an interim report in April 2013, recommending that Scotland have autonomy over income tax, but leaving decisions on corporation tax and welfare to the UK Parliament. But party members opposed it, warning that the plans could threaten the Barnett formula, the financial mechanism under which Scotland receives an annual average of ¬£1,600 per head more in UK Government spending than does the rest of the UK. Ian Davidson, chair of the House of Commons Scottish Affairs Select Committee said the proposals could affect spending in poorer areas. Macintosh subsequently warned that devolving responsibility for income tax would reduce the Scottish tax base and result in independence by default, a claim that Guy Lodge and Alan Trench of the Institute for Public Policy Research called \\"highly disingenuous\\" because income tax makes up only 23% of the taxes collected by the UK Government. The Commission's final report, Powers for a Purpose was published on 18 March 2014, setting out recommendations that would be implemented if Scotland voted no in the referendum, and Labour were elected in 2015. The proposals included allowing the Scottish Parliament to raise as much as 40% of its annual revenue, and giving it greater leeway to vary income tax rates from those in the rest of the UK. The plans would build on the powers devolved under the 2012 Scotland Act, which legislated for an increase in responsibility over taxation from 2016, in exchange for a 10% reduction in the grant received from Westminster. The Commission also recommended devolving responsibility in some other fiscal areas, such as the payment of Housing Benefit and the possible levy of a mansion tax in Scotland, but decided against taking charge of other financial matters, including state pensions, National Insurance and tariffs on North Sea oil. Other proposals were to retain the Barnett formula, give Scotland control over its railways, and transfer authority for dissolving parliament and holding elections from Westminster to Holyrood. Lamont described the proposals as \\"the right balance between fiscal accountability and insuring us against risk\\". Ben Thomson, chair of the cross-party Devo Plus think tank argued the plans were \\"just tinkering with the current system\\" and would allow the SNP to \\"say that the unionist parties aren't interested in real devolution\\". Deputy First Minister Sturgeon welcomed the prospect of increased devolution, but said a vote for independence was the only way to ensure greater powers for Scotland as \\"there [was] no guarantee that any new powers would be delivered in the event of a no vote\\". The proposals were subsequently endorsed by delegates at Scottish Labour's 2014 party conference. =Free public services debate= In September 2012, Lamont announced a policy review of Scotland's universal benefits, signalling that a future Labour administration would reverse many of the free services introduced since power was devolved to Scotland. Launching the review at an address to party delegates in Edinburgh, she questioned whether services such as prescriptions and tuition feeswhich are free in Scotlandshould continue to be available to all, regardless of income, and suggested the situation was unsustainable: \\"I believe our resources must go to those in greatest need ... Salmond's most cynical trick was to make people believe that more was free, when the poorest are paying for the tax breaks for the rich ... Scotland cannot be the only something-for-nothing country in the world.\\" The speech was condemned by the SNP, which branded it as \\"Blairite\\", while deputy party leader Sturgeon called the strategy \\"disastrous\\". The approach was also questioned by Richard Seymour of The Guardian, who suggested it could damage Labour's electoral appeal: \\"Outside Scotland, this policy would merely be a gift to the Tories, by corroborating their arguments for welfare cuts. In Scotland, it reminds ex-Labour voters why they defected to the SNP: as a defensive shield against such policies.\\" Owen Jones of The Independent suggested it was \\"a baffling political strategy to outflank the SNP from the right\\". Lamont returned to the issue of universal tuition fees again in a speech in Glasgow on 17 December 2012 to mark the first anniversary of her election as Labour leader. She suggested that the Graduate Endowment, a system abolished by the SNP Government, could be reinstated if Labour were re-elected at the next Scottish parliamentary election. Ian Grant, a retired college principal, welcomed her comments as \\"courageous\\", but Jamie Kinlochan, a member of the National Union of Students Scotland expressed concerns that students would be discouraged by extra financial costs on top of loans and other expenses. In January 2014, Lamont and Scottish Labour faced criticism after the party voted against an SNP motion that included the introduction of free school meals for pupils in their first three years of primary education, and a commitment to childcare for pre-school children. The motion also contained measures that would only be implemented in the event of Scottish independence, something Labour said it could not support. Recalling her experience of teaching underprivileged children, Lamont told the parliament that free school meals would not be her priority, and tabled an unsuccessful amendment calling for greater childcare provisions instead. The motion was later passed by a majority of 67‚Äì46. In The Daily Telegraph, Cochrane wrote that the strategy had allowed the SNP to claim Labour opposed the principle of free school meals because they \\"fell for a bit of skulduggery that Ms Lamont and her business managers should have seen coming a mile off\\". =Falkirk candidate selection row and Grangemouth dispute= In 2013, Labour and Police Scotland launched separate investigations into claims that officials of the Unite union had signed their members up to Labour to get their preferred candidate adopted to represent the party in the Falkirk constituency. The union officials were later cleared of any wrongdoing. It was later claimed that key evidence thought to have been retracted had not been withdrawn, prompting several Falkirk councillors to urge Miliband to publish details of the party's internal inquiry or to hold a fresh investigation. On the 4 November edition of Good Morning Scotland, Lamont said there was a case for a fresh inquiry, but that Labour does not publish details of its internal investigations. Later the same day, Labour said that it would not be reopening the investigation. Miliband subsequently said that a new investigation was unnecessary. On 8 December the former MSP Karen Whitefield was selected to contest the seat. The report into Labour's inquiry was leaked to the media in February 2014, and concluded there was \\"no doubt\\" that Unite had attempted to manipulate the selection process. In October 2013 Lamont faced criticism for her reaction to an industrial dispute at the Grangemouth Oil Refinery. Ineos, the company that operates the plant, had stated that the refinery was making financial losses, and had proposed a survival plan requiring employees to accept worse employment terms, notably changes in work rules and less generous pensions; this the employees rejected. The company mothballed the plant, threatening to close it if the terms were not accepted. Lamont urged Ineos to withdraw its conditions and for both sides to hold talks, while Salmond tried to negotiate an agreement. Union officials eventually agreed not to call a strike for at least three years, and the plant reopened. The Ineos chairman, Calum MacLean, described Lamont's support for the trade unions during the dispute as \\"deeply irresponsible\\", while Salmond claimed she had been silent throughout the disagreement. Writing for the Dunfermline Press, Natalie McGarry suggested that while the Labour leader's silence probably had much to do with the continuing Falkirk selection row, ultimately she was \\"found wanting\\". =Resignation= Scotland voted by a 10% margin against independence, but the referendum returned \\"Yes\\" votes in some traditional Labour strongholds, particularly Glasgow and North Lanarkshire, prompting media speculation about Lamont's future as the party's leader. Shortly after the referendum, a Daily Mail article claimed that Shadow International Development Secretary Jim Murphy was being lined up to take over from her, while The Herald reported that party delegates concerned about the results had started to view Murphy as a possible successor. Lamont had attempted to quash rumours of a leadership challenge at the 25 September 2014 session of First Minister's Questions, the first of the post-referendum era. \\"When the First Minister is long gone I will still be doing my job on behalf of the people of Scotland.\\" Her position remained uncertain. Alan Cochrane wrote that many Labour MPs in Scotland feared losing their seats at the 2015 general election without a change of leadership. In October, two former first ministers voiced their concern about the direction of the party. McConnell expressed fears that Labour would experience increased difficulty in regaining the confidence of Scottish voters following the election of Sturgeon as SNP leader, and described the party as \\"a political machine that is angry about what has happened in Scotland in the recent past\\". Shortly afterwards, his predecessor, Henry McLeish suggested Labour had ceded \\"enormous ground to the SNP unnecessarily\\" because its supporters no longer understood \\"what the party stands for\\". Margaret Curran, the Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland, said that although the party was changing, it needed to reconnect with its \\"socialist principles\\". Lamont's resignation as Labour leader was reported by media outlets on the evening of 24 October 2014, following the publication of an interview with the Daily Record in which she announced her intention to step down with immediate effect. She told the newspaper that she was resigning because Labour's Westminster leadership had undermined her attempts to reform the party in Scotland, and treated Scottish Labour \\"like a branch office of London.\\" She described some London-based colleagues as \\"dinosaurs\\" unable to understand that \\"Scotland has changed forever\\" following the referendum. Lamont was also angry that she had not been consulted on some matters, such as a decision by the UK leadership to replace Ian Price as Scottish Labour's General Secretary. In her letter of resignation, submitted to Scottish Labour Party Chairman Jamie Glackin, Lamont accused \\"senior members of the party\\" of questioning her role and said that she was taking herself \\"out of the equation\\" to allow Scottish Labour to have a discussion about the best way forward. Anas Sarwar became Labour's acting leader. On 26 October, following a meeting of the party's executive committee, he outlined the details of a leadership election, which would be held using the three-tier electoral college, and conclude with the announcement of a new leader on 13 December. Murphy, Boyack and Neil Findlay stood in the subsequent contest, with Murphy elected as Lamont's successor. Lamont did not vote for Murphy in the election, but instead chose to back his rivals. Miliband paid tribute to Lamont shortly after she announced that she intended to relinquish the leadership role, saying she had \\"led the Scottish Labour Party with determination\\". McLeish and McConnell both indicated that Lamont's sudden departure following weeks of speculation could have implications for Miliband's leadership. McLeish said that Miliband's chance of becoming Prime Minister could be affected if Labour returned fewer Scottish MPs in 2015, something he called a problem of \\"historic, epic proportions\\", while McConnell said that he was \\"very, very angry\\" and suggested Miliband had questions to answer about the circumstances surrounding the resignation. Salmond echoed the views of his predecessor, arguing that Miliband \\"should be answering questions about why Labour in Scotland is run as an extension of his Westminster office, and why he has effectively forced the resignation of a Labour leader in Scotland.\\" Ed Balls, the Shadow Chancellor, rejected Lamont's claims about UK Labour's treatment of its Scottish counterpart. Ian Davidson claimed that supporters of Murphy, who subsequently announced his intention to stand in the leadership contest to succeed Lamont, had conducted a whispering campaign against her. He further suggested that those on the right of the party had resented her election as leader and ignored her, treating her as a \\"wee lassie\\". Post leadership Labour went on to suffer significant losses, both in the 2015 UK general election, and the 2016 Scottish Parliament election. In Glasgow, where the party had traditionally enjoyed strong support, both elections produced a result in which every Labour held constituency was lost to the SNP, while in 2016 the Conservatives overtook Labour as the second largest party at Holyrood. Lamont lost her Glasgow Pollok seat to the SNP's Humza Yousaf, who secured it with a majority of 6,484, but she was one of four Labour candidates elected to the Glasgow regional list, where she was joined by Sarwar, James Kelly and Pauline McNeill. In response to the results, Lamont suggested Labour needed to understand the reasons behind it, and suggested that the 2014 referendum could be partially responsible. \\"A bit of it, I think, is still the referendum, the Yes/No is the divide in people‚Äôs minds rather than the politics of taxation, investing in public services against a low tax economy and so on.\\" In November 2016 she was announced as a member of the Commission on Parliamentary Reform, having been nominated to represent Scottish Labour. In May 2018, Lamont was selected as Scottish Labour's prospective parliamentary candidate (PPC) for the Glasgow South UK Parliament constituency. In the 2017 general election, the constituency had been held by the SNP's Stewart Malcolm McDonald with a majority of just 2,027. She contested the seat at the snap general election in December 2019 but was defeated by McDonald, whose majority increased to 9,005 over Labour. Politics and views Although she has been criticised by SNP politicians for taking a \\"Blairite\\" stance on public services, The Guardians Peter Hetherington has described Lamont as \\"rooted to older [Labour] party values, with a deep commitment to fairness\\". Her politics were heavily influenced by her inner city upbringing and her career in teaching. Her childhood experience was something she addressed in an emotional speech to delegates at the 2013 Scottish Labour Party Conference: \\"I saw in my upbringing the beauty of our land and felt both the warmth of community and the harshness and brutality at times of trying to make a living here. I had the privilege to grow up in a family of love, but one where my mother always reminded me that what we ate, what we wore, where we lived, was all the product of the sweat of my father's brow earned at sea. And I respected that.\\" Throughout her career, Lamont has campaigned on issues such as equality and violence against women. Her profile on the Scottish Parliament website lists her political interests as being focussed on tackling poverty, women's rights and disability issues. She credits Curran, and the work of author Erin Pizzey for helping to broaden her understanding of women's issues. On 12 March 2014, she led a Scottish Parliament debate in which she discussed the increased opportunities available for women in Scotland, whilst highlighting issues she felt still needed to be addressed. At First Minister's Questions, she often highlighted personal stories of members of the public, believing them to bring an element of real life into the Parliament. Along with Holyrood's other opposition leaders, Lamont signed the Equality Network's Equal Marriage Pledge in favour of legalising same-sex marriage in January 2012, and voted in favour of the Marriage and Civil Partnership Bill on 4 February 2014. As someone with a Gaelic background, she has spoken of her belief in the importance of providing support for the language, feeling it has an economic benefit for Scotland. On the death of 95-year-old Nelson Mandela in December 2013, Lamont joined other public figures in paying tribute to him, describing the former South African President as \\"the towering figure of my life since I became politically aware\\". Lamont has said that Labour lost the 2011 Scottish Parliament election because the party lost its direction, and that having failed to recognise the 2007 result as a defeat, it picked up the wrong signals from the 2010 general election that saw a strong Scottish Labour vote at Westminster. In February 2012, she told the Times Educational Supplement, \\"We misread the 2010 (general) election, thinking it was confirmation that Scotland was a Labour country ‚Äì it was probably confirmation that Scotland was still anti-Tory. There's an issue about rebuilding trust, and our confidence in the values that brought us into politics.\\" She told delegates at the 2012 Scottish Labour Party conference that it was time for them to stop apologising for past mistakes. \\"We know what happened last May ‚Äì we looked tired and complacent and we got the kind of beating we deserved. But now, we need to start building the kind of Scottish Labour Party which Scotland deserves and which Scotland needs.\\" In an interview with Scotland on Sunday in September 2013, Lamont signalled her support for the creation of a land tax as part of reforms to local taxation, suggesting that the council tax freeze introduced by the SNP had resulted in a funding shortfall. At the 2014 Scottish Trades Union Congress annual conference, Lamont outlined plans to establish a Workers' Charter, saying she would work with the SNP government to achieve this. Media image After her inaugural session of First Minister's Questions on 22 December 2011, the BBC's Brian Taylor called Lamont's performance \\"confident, direct and salient\\". Cochrane has suggested that she emerged as the prevailing force at the weekly debates with Salmond, writing in May 2013, \\"it's been obvious for some time to those of us in the cheap seats that Johann Lamont has more than got his measure.\\" Peter Hetherington of The Guardian quotes an unnamed political observer at Holyrood who said, \\"She's getting under [Salmond's] skin like no predecessor.\\" Writing for The Scotsman as Scottish Labour gathered for its conference in April 2013, Andrew Whitaker felt that Lamont's tenure as party leader had been successful, citing Labour's local election achievements and her weekly exchanges with Salmond at First Minister's Questions as examples: \\"Ms Lamont has made Labour at Holyrood respectable again and less of the laughing stock than the ravaged party that emerged from heavy defeat in 2011.\\" Her media appearances were criticised for their awkwardness. In September 2012, Richard Seymour of The Guardian described how she \\"fluffed her lines\\" during an interview with STV reporter Bernard Ponsonby following her announcement of Labour's public service policy review. Peter Ross of The Scotsman cites another interview, in which she was repeatedly questioned about her views on the UK Trident programme. But he describes her in person as \\"articulate, reflective, self-deprecating and at times very funny. It would be unfair to condemn her for not being a sound-bite politician; she ought to be applauded for it, but the trouble is we live in a sound-bite age.\\" Mandy Rhodes of Holyrood magazine writes, \\"despite a reputation as being a bit of a fierce one, [Lamont] is actually, really rather entertaining, engaging and wonderfully self-deprecating.\\" The BBC's Marianne Taylor describes Lamont as \\"Quietly spoken and more humorous in person than she comes across on television\\". Ian Swanson of The Scotsman has described her as \\"dour but passionate\\". Lamont's low public recognition indicated by the December 2013 TNS BMRB poll led Herald columnist Alison Rowat to label her \\"the invisible woman of the independence debate\\", and to suggest she needed to raise her profile. Impressionist Jonathan Watson satirised Lamont in the 2013 edition of BBC Scotland's annual Hogmanay comedy show Only an Excuse?, featuring a sketch in which she debates Scottish independence with Salmond. Awards Lamont's decision to question the status quo over the availability of free public services for all earned her the Political Impact of the Year award at the 2012 Herald Scottish Politician of the Year Awards. She was also nominated for Politician of the Year at the same ceremony, but beaten by Deputy First Minister Sturgeon.

It is Denmark's largest company within the aerospace and defense industry, employing approximately 1,100 people worldwide. The company was founded in 1949 by Orla and Svend Aage J√∏rgensen; it originally focused on the production of thermometers and manometers for ships and various other metal components. Following its purchase by Thorkild Juncker, Terma A/S refocused itself on the production of electronic measuring instruments along with early radar systems; it expanded rapidly during the 1950s and 1960s. The firm became a leader in defence electronics, and had diversified into air defense systems, aircraft avionics, and missiles by 1970. It continued to grow, acquiring various other Danish defense firms during the 1990s. In 1999, Terma A/S acted at the prime contractor for the √òrsted satellite, the first Danish satellite to be launched into space. By 2013, the group's international customers contribute more than 87% of Terma's total sales. Terma A/S headquarters are located in Lystrup near √Örhus, Denmark. In Denmark, other Terma facilities are located at Grenaa and Herlev. Terma international locations and operations include Leiden and Woensdrecht in the Netherlands; Darmstadt near Frankfurt, Germany; Harwell, UK; Singapore, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates and New Delhi, India. In 2004 the company opened an office in Warner Robins, Georgia. Today, the company's U.S. activities also include the Terma North America Inc. headquarters in Arlington, Virginia and offices in Fort Worth, Texas and Norfolk, Virginia. History During 1944, amid the final months of the Second World War, the company was founded by the brothers Orla and Svend Aage J√∏rgensen as a small mechanical workshop based in Aarhus, Denmark; the name Terma is said to be derived from the firm's early work on thermometers and manometers. Five years later, it was restructured as a limited liability company under the name Fabrik for M√•leinstrumenter TERMA A/S; at the point of incorporation, the company had fewer than 10 employees. During 1949, it was bought by Thorkild Juncker. Juncker shifted Terma A/S in the direction of electronic measuring instruments and with the employment of a Norwegian engineer soon developed a radar that would prove to be competitive in both price and quality. Within six years of buying Terma, Juncker was employing up to 120 people before his untimely death in 1955. It was under Juncker's ownership and management that Terma developed into the company it is today. Throughout the 1950s, Terma A/S conducted numerous large-scale projects involving the overhaul and upgrade of radars, computer systems, and air defense systems on behalf of the Danish Armed Forces. Its first radar systems were for navigation purposes and installed mainly on secondary vessels. Over a period of 20 years, Terma A/S opted to focus much of its resources onto the development of numerous products related to radars, computers, and missile systems, and started to expanded into the wider European market. During the 1960s, Terma A/S secured work within several international programs, such as the development and production of the RIM-7 Sea Sparrow surface-to-air missile; the firm continued to be involved in the Sea Sparrow's support for over fifty years. In 1961, Terma A/S commenced development of the first Doppler radar, which was used to measure the velocity of the Sidewinder air-to-air missile. During 1966, the firm was awarded the first European contract to deliver a ground check-out system for satellites. The 1970s was a turbulent time for Terma A/S in terms of its ownership; it briefly became a subsidiary of several firms, including the Dannebrog Gruppen and BW Holding. During the early 1970s, Terma A/S became an active participant in the space industry, beginning production of equipment for a variety of scientific satellite missions over the following years, supplying both hardware and software systems for this sector. In 1977, Terma A/S took over the Bravour company, through which it established its own extensive range of VHF-based communication equipment which, amongst other customers, was heavily used by the Danish Armed Forces. Following Denmark's decision to purchase the Swedish-built Saab 35 Draken fighter aircraft during the early 1970s, Terma A/S was awarded its first contract for supply of critical aircraft electronics. Around this same time, the firm also became involved in the supply of various aviation electronics systems for the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon fighter aircraft, particularly those that were purchased by European customers; this co-production arrangement was considered a break-through for Terma A/S. During 1980, the Thomas B. Thrige Foundation took over the majority of the stocks in Terma A/S. That decade, following an order from the Royal Danish Air Force, the company developed an original self- protection system compatible with both fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. Terma A/S also developed new command and control systems for Royal Danish Navy vessels at its newly-created project department, based in T√•strup, outside Copenhagen. During 1993, the company reached an agreement with NATO for the establishment of a maintenance and upgrade center for the MIM-23 Hawk surface- to-air missile system. In 1996, Terma A/S's AN/ALQ213(V) Electronic Warfare Management System was approved for use by the United States Air Force; it was subsequently installed upon in excess of 1,000 American aircraft. In the late 1990s, Terma A/S acquired Computer Resources International, a Danish aerospace and defense company, as well as the Danish aircraft company Per Udsen Co. Aircraft. During 1999, the Danish √òrsted satellite was successfully launched with Terma A/S being the lead supplier on the project; it was the first, and so far only, Danish satellite to be launched into space. During 2000, Terma A/S was also contracted by the Royal Netherlands Air Force to supply its self- protection systems for the service's Boeing CH-47 Chinook and Eurocopter AS532 Cougar helicopter fleets. In 2001, the firm's Power Conditioning Unit was adopted for the European Space Agency's (ESA) deep space missions, including Rosetta, Mars Express and Venus Express. That same year, Terma announced its renaming from Terma Elektronik A/S to simply Terma A/S, which was accompanied by a new logo and graphic design. During 2004, Terma relocated all of its Copenhagen-based activities to a new office at the Herlev area; that same year, Terma North America Inc. opens offices in the US. In the early 2000s, the firm established agreements with the American defence contractors Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics to act as a subcontractor on the production of the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II fighter aircraft; the firm was subsequently chosen to develop and produce several components and designs for the F-35, including the gun pod and miscellaneous aerostructures. In 2006, a similar arrangement was agreed with Eurofighter GmbH for the Eurofighter Typhoon fighter aircraft; Terma A/S also worked with Saab on its Saab JAS 39 Gripen fighter. Business areas and Products Terma delivers parts and technologies for the F-35 Lightning The power conditioning unit and solar panels of the Rosetta spacecraft is produced by Terma Terma's radar systems are used around Horns Rev wind farm to avoid the turning blades of the turbines from appearing as objects The business areas of Terma can be divided into the following categories: Aerostructures, Space, Defense, and Security & Surveillance: =Aerostructures= Terma Aerostructures A/S is headquartered in Grenaa, Denmark, focusing on design and manufacture of aerostructures for aerospace and defense companies. Terma is a strategic supplier to the F-35 Lightning II, delivering a series of parts, components, and technologies to the fighter aircraft. The company delivers leading edges through Lockheed Martin, composite tail parts through BAE Systems, gun pods for the F-35B and C versions through General Dynamics, as well as fuselage parts and electronics through Northrop Grumman Corporation. Overall, Terma delivers more than 70 parts for the F-35 Lightning II. =Space= Space (SPD), providing on-board electronics and software for satellites as well as control centres. Key focus areas are power conditioning systems and star trackers for satellites. Power conditioning units Terma delivers power conditioning systems to a series of major space products, including ESA's BepiColombo and Rosetta. In the case of BepiColombo, the power conditioning unit is the most powerful used on missions by the ESA with a capacity of 14 kW powered by solar energy on its destination planet Mercury. In the Rosetta project Terma has developed a 64 square meter solar panel providing power at down to four percent of the Earth's solar energy and at working temperatures down to -130 degrees Celsius. The PCU delivers a bus power capability of 1500 watt at a weight of 8.3 kilo.Stage, Mie. \\"Terma-elektronik v√¶kker rumsonde fra √•relang dvale\\" Ingeni√∏ren, 19 January 2014.Jensen, H. & Laursen, J. \\"Power Conditioning Unit for Rosetta/Mars Express\\" Space Power, Proceedings of the Sixth European Conference held 6‚Äì10 May 2002 in Porto, Portugal.

Terma is responsible for ensuring technical management of the project and for the coordination with ESA and subcontractors, and not least for delivering the ASIM observatory for handover to ESA, NASA, and SpaceX at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). ASIM was launched for the International Space Station (ISS) on 2 April 2018, and will be installed on the European Columbus-module of ISS in the beginning of 2018. ASIM will be used by scientists in order to study high-altitude electrical discharges, the so-called red sprites, blue jets, haloes, and elves, and monitor X-ray and Gamma-ray flashes. =Defense= Terma produces C-Flex command and control systems for war ships; as of 2013, it has been installed upon ships of the Danish, Lithuanian, Romanian and Thai Navy. The C-Flex systems and the Terma SCANTER radar systems are supplied to new-built ships such as the Royal Thai Navy Landing Docks, the Danish Absalon-Class Support Ships, and the Danish Iver Huitfeldt-class frigates as well as upgrades on ships in service, such as the Danish Thetis-Class and offshore patrol vessels. The company develops electronic warfare protection systems and 3D-audio systems as upgrades for the F-16 fighters of the Royal Danish Air Force. Additionally, Terma has supplied electronic warfare solutions for the EPAF countries and the U.S. Air National Guard for F-16, A-10, Tornado and Harrier aircraft. Terma develops aircraft survivability equipment for a variety of SAR and transportation helicopters, including the 14 Royal Danish Air Force EH-101 Merlin helicopters in collaboration with Agusta Westland, and self-protection systems for the Royal Netherlands Air Force AH-64D and CH-47 Chinook helicopters. The Terma Electronic Warfare Management Systems are fielded internationally on more than 2,000 fighter and transportation aircraft and helicopters. Terma A/S also produces Missile Warning Systems as an integral part of the electronic warfare solution for the F-16s of the Danish and Norwegian air forces, mounting the systems on pylons instead of the traditional fuselage installation. =Security & Surveillance= The Terma SCANTER 5202 radar is used by coast guard services including the U.S. Coast Guard, the Spanish Guardia Civil, the Colombian Coast Guard, the Norwegian Coast Guard, Port of London, and Port of Hong Kong to track marine vessels and aircraft, while the Terma ET2 embedded tracker is developed to help track stealth objects or smaller objects in the presence of clutter.

He is best known for the Norske Folkeeventyr, a collection of Norwegian folk tales which he edited in collaboration with Peter Christen Asbj√∏rnsen. He also served as the Bishop of the Diocese of Kristianssand from 1874 until his death in 1882.  Biography  J√∏rgen Engebretsen Moe was born at the farm of √òvre Moe in the municipality of Hole in the traditional district of Ringerike. He was the son of local farmer and politician Engebret Olsen Moe. He first met Asbj√∏rnsen while the two were preparing for exams at Norderhov Rectory and soon found they had a shared interest in folklore. Starting in 1841, Moe traveled almost every summer through the southern parts of Norway, collecting traditions and stories from the people living in the mountainous areas. In 1845, he was appointed professor of theology in the Norwegian Military Academy. However, Moe had long intended to take holy orders, and in 1853 he did so. He became a resident chaplain in Kr√∏dsherad at Olberg Church and Holmen Church in Sigdal, positions that he held for 10 years. At his first parish he found inspiration for many of his most famous poems, like den gamle Mester (The Old Master) and S√¶terjentens S√∏ndag (Sunday at the Mountain Pastures). In 1863, he moved to Drammen and became parish priest of Bragernes Church, then in 1870 he moved again to Vestre Aker, close to Christiania (now Oslo). In 1874, he became bishop in the Diocese of Kristianssand based at the Kristiansand Cathedral, a position he held from 1874until his death in 1882. He was a much beloved bishop, and his teaching had a great impact on his contemporaries. Moe has a special claim on critical attention in regard to his lyrical poems, of which a small collection appeared in 1850. Moe felt strongly that writing should be \\"objective,\\" in the sense that it removed the ego from the narrative. Still, he strove to build and maintain a literary aesthetic in his work. He wrote little original verse, but in his slender volume are to be found many pieces of exquisite delicacy and freshness. Moe also published a delightful collection of prose stories for children, I Br√∏nden og i Tjernet (In the Well and in the Tarn), 1851; and En liden Julegave (A Little Christmas Present), 1860. Asbj√∏rnsen and Moe had the advantage of an admirable style of narrative prose. It was usual that the vigor came from Asbj√∏rnsen and the charm from Moe, but it seems that from the long habit of writing in unison they had come to adopt almost precisely identical modes of literary expression.The Norwegian Folk Tales and their Illustrators (Norway List) Moe was appointed Knight of the Order of St. Olav in 1873 and was made commander of the 1st cross class in 1881. During January 1882, he resigned his diocese due to failing health, and he died the following March. His son, Moltke Moe, continued his father's work in folklore and fairy tales and became the first professor of the subject at Christiania University.J√∏rgen Moe (Norsk Litteraturhistorie)  Impact on Norwegian culture  Together with Peter Christen Asbj√∏rnsen, the impact of J√∏rgen Moe on Norwegian culture was enormous. To Norwegians, the names Asbj√∏rnsen and Moe have become synonymous with traditional folk tales, the way the name Brothers Grimm is associated with German tales. Not only did they collect and secure parts of the wealth of Norwegian fairy tales and edit them for common readers, but in doing this, they also contributed to the development of the Norwegian language. Even if other countries have a rich folk literature, Norwegians will normally claim that theirs, through the work of Asbj√∏rnsen and Moe, is one of the most original and rich. Their work constitutes a very important part of Norwegian identity. Askeladden (Ash Boy), a character whose creativity and resourcefulness always wins him the Princess and half the Kingdom, is seen as something typically Norwegian. Some of his works of poetry are still cherished, not least because of the tunes set to them. His achievements in the Church are now mostly forgotten, except locally. Ringerikes Museum Ringerikes Museum is the regional museum for the municipalities of Hole and Ringerike in Buskerud county. Ringerikes Museum is located in H√∏nefoss at the site of the former Norderhov rectory where Asbj√∏rnsen and Moe first met. It is now the local museum for the Ringerike region and contains a collection of Asbj√∏rnsen and Moe memorabilia. The museum is also noted for its collection of the private belongings of J√∏rgen Moe. In the 1930s, Marie Moe, J√∏rgen Moe's daughter, provided a gift consisting of several hundred objects from Jorgen Moe's private home.

The name is variously translated as Institute of Sex Research, Institute of Sexology, Institute for Sexology or Institute for the Science of Sexuality. The Institute was a non-profit foundation situated in Tiergarten, Berlin. It was headed by Magnus Hirschfeld. Since 1897 he had run the Wissenschaftlich- humanit√§res Komitee (\\"Scientific-Humanitarian Committee\\"), which campaigned on progressive and rational grounds for LGBT rights and tolerance. The Committee published the long-running journal Jahrbuch f√ºr sexuelle Zwischenstufen. Hirschfeld built a unique library on same-sex love and eroticism.Harry Oosterhuis. (Ed.)

After the Nazis gained control of Germany in the 1930s, the institute and its libraries were destroyed as part of a Nazi government censorship program by youth brigades, who burned its books and documents in the street.

This photo is from Hirschfeld's Sexual Intermediates (1922).The Institute of Sex Research was opened in 1919 by Magnus Hirschfeld and his collaborator Arthur Kronfeld,In Memory of Arthur Kronfeld) a once famous psychotherapist and later professor at the Charit√©. As well as being a research library and housing a large archive, the Institute also included medical, psychological, and ethnological divisions, and a marriage and sex counseling office. The Institute was visited by around 20,000 people each year, and conducted around 1,800 consultations. Poorer visitors were treated for free. In addition, the institute advocated sex education, contraception, the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases, and women's emancipation. The Institute became a point of scientific and research interest for many scientists of sexuality, as well as scientific, political and social reformers in Germany and Europe, particularly from socialist, liberal and social- democratic circles. In 1923 the Institute was visited by Nikolai Semashko, Commissar for Health in the Soviet Union. This was followed by numerous visits and research trips by health officials, political, sexual and social reformers, and scientific researchers from the Soviet Union interested in the work of Hirschfeld.Homosexual Desire in Revolutionary Russia: The Regulation of Sexual and Gender Dissent, Dan Healey, 2001, pp.132-133 In 1926 a delegation from the institute, led by Hirschfeld, reciprocated with a research visit to Moscow. In 1929 Hirschfeld presided over the third international congress of the World League for Sexual Reform at Wigmore Hall.The Times, League For Sexual Reform International Congress Opened, 9 September 1929; Transsexualism Magnus Hirschfeld coined the term transsexualism,Ekins R., King D. (2001) Pioneers of Transgendering: The Popular Sexology of David O. Cauldwell. IJT 5,2 ( text online ) identifying the clinical category which his colleague Harry Benjamin would later develop in the United States. Transgender people were on the staff of the Institute, as well as being among the clients there. Various endocrinologic and surgical services were offered, including the first modern sex reassignment surgeries in the 1930s. Hirschfeld also worked with Berlin's police department to curtail the arrest of cross-dressed individuals, including those suspected of wearing certain clothing in connection with sex work, through the creation of transvestite passes issued on behalf of the Institute to those who had a personal desire to wear clothing associated with a gender other than the one assigned to them at birth. Nazi era Students of the Deutsche Studentenschaft, organized by the Nazi party, parade in front of the Institute for Sexual Research in Berlin on 6 May 1933. In late February 1933, as the influence of Ernst R√∂hm weakened, the Nazi Party launched its purge of gay (then known as homophile) clubs in Berlin, outlawed sex publications, and banned organised gay groups. As a consequence, many fled Germany (including, for instance, Erika Mann). In March 1933 the Institute's main administrator, Kurt Hiller, was sent to a concentration camp. The buildings were later taken over by the Nazis for their own purposes. They were a bombed-out ruin by 1944, and were demolished sometime in the mid-1950s. Hirschfeld tried, in vain, to re-establish his Institute in Paris, but he died in France in 1935. On 6 May 1933, while Hirschfeld was in Ascona, Switzerland, the Deutsche Studentenschaft made an organised attack on the Institute of Sex Research. A few days later, the Institute's library and archives were publicly hauled out and burned in the streets of the Opernplatz. Between 12,000 to 20,000 books and journals, and even larger number of images and sex subjects, were destroyed. Also seized were the Institute's extensive lists of names and addresses. In the midst of the burning, Joseph Goebbels gave a political speech to a crowd of around 40,000 people. The leaders of the Deutsche Studentenschaft also proclaimed their own Feuerspr√ºche (fire decrees). Also books by Jewish writers, and pacifists such as Erich Maria Remarque, were removed from local public libraries and the Humboldt University, and were burned.Leonidas Hill (2001). \\"The Nazi Attack on 'Un-German' Literature, 1933-1945\\" IN: The Holocaust and the Book: Destruction and Preservation. While many fled into exile, the radical activist Adolf Brand made a stand in Germany for five months after the book burnings, but in November 1933 he had given up gay activism. On 28 June 1934 Hitler conducted a purge of gay men in the ranks of the SA wing of the Nazis, which involved murdering them in the Night of the Long Knives. This was then followed by stricter laws on homosexuality and the round-up of gay men. The address lists seized from the Institute are believed to have aided Hitler in these actions. Many tens of thousands of arrestees found themselves, ultimately, in slave-labour or death camps. Karl Giese committed suicide in 1938 when the Germans invaded Czechoslovakia and his heir, lawyer Karl Fein, was murdered in 1942 during deportation. After World War II The charter of the institute had specified that in the event of dissolution, any assets of the Dr. Magnus Hirschfeld Foundation (which had sponsored the Institute since 1924) were to be donated to the Humboldt University of Berlin. Hirschfeld also wrote a personal will while in exile in Paris, leaving any remaining assets to his students and heirs Karl Giese and Li Shiu Tong (Tao Li) for the continuation of his work. However, neither stipulation was carried out. The West German courts found that the foundation's dissolution and the seizure of property by the Nazis in 1934 was legal. The West German legislature also retained the Nazi amendments to Paragraph 175, making it impossible for surviving gay men to claim restitution for the destroyed cultural center.James D. Steakley. The Early Homosexual Emancipation Movement in Germany. (1975). Li Shiu Tong lived in Switzerland and the United States until 1956, but as far as is known, he did not attempt to continue Hirschfeld's work. Some remaining fragments of data from the library were later collected by W. Dorr Legg and ONE, Inc. in the USA in the 1950s.

Prior to this act, blacks and whites alike were having trouble buying land. Sharecropping and tenant farming had become ways of life. This act attempted to solve this by selling land at low prices so that southerners could buy it. Many people, however, could still not participate because the low prices were still too high.Paul Wallace Gates, \\"Federal Land Policy in the South 1866-1888.\\" Journal of Southern History (1940) 6#3 pp: 303-330. in JSTOR Legislative history A \\"Second Freedmen's Bureau bill\\" was introduced December 5, 1865, but was vetoed and weakened before eventually overriding a second veto by president Andrew Johnson. Championed by General Oliver O. Howard, chief of the Freedmen's Bureau, and with support from Thaddeus Stevens and William Fessenden, the Southern Homestead Act was proposed to Congress, and eventually passed, and signed into law by President Andrew Johnson on June 21, 1866, going into effect immediately. The Southern Homestead Act opened up 46,398,544.87 acres (about 46 million acres or 190,000 km¬≤) of public land for sale in the Southern states of Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi. The land was initially in parcels of (half-quarter section) until June 1868, and thereafter parcels of (quarter section), and homesteaders were required to occupy and improve the land for five years before acquiring full ownership. Until January 1, 1867, the bill specified, only free Blacks and loyal Whites would be allowed access to these lands.Oubre, Forty Acres and a Mule (1978), pp. 86‚Äì87. Accordingly, the primary beneficiaries for the first six months were freedmen who were in desperate need of land to till. However, the law encountered many obstacles, notably: Southern bureaucrats often did not comply with the law or with the orders of the Freedmen's Bureau, notably not informing blacks of their right to land (thus delaying and allowing Confederates to be eligible, from 1867);Oubre, Forty Acres and a Mule (1978), p. 81, 93. violence from Southern whites; poor quality of the land and extremely harsh conditions (on land that had been rejected by previous settlers); and poverty of the farmers (unable to effectively use the land without further money to invest). Ultimately, before too much land was distributed, the law was repealed in June 1876.Paul W. Gates, \\"Federal Land Policy in the South, 1866-1888,\\" Journal of Southern History, 6 (August 1940), 310-315. Nevertheless, free Blacks entered about 6,500 claims to homesteads, and about 1,000 of these eventually resulted in property certificates.Oubre, Forty Acres and a Mule (1978), p. 188.

Biography Babak Payami was born in Tehran in 1966. He grew up in Afghanistan and Iran before leaving for Europe and subsequently Canada where he became a Canadian citizen. He later enrolled in the cinema studies program at the University of Toronto during the early 90s while working as translator and court interpreter. In 1998 Payami returned to Iran where he wrote, produced and directed his debut feature film \\"One More Day\\". It premiered in the official Panorama Special program of the Berlin International Film Festival 2000. He later wrote, directed and co-produced with Marco Mueller, his second feature film \\"Secret Ballot\\" which went on to compete in the official program of the Venice International Film Festival in 2001. The film earned him several accolades in Venice including the Best Director award. In 2002 Payami began production on \\"Silence Between Two Thoughts\\" which he wrote, directed and produced in the remote areas of eastern Iran close to the borders of Afghanistan and Pakistan. The film was completed after a difficult 73-day shoot. Payami was eventually arrested by Iranian officials during the editing of the film. All original negative and sound material for Silence Between Two Thoughts was confiscated by the Iranian government and Babak Payami was forced into exile during the summer of 2003. A working copy of the film was salvaged on a hard disk and with help from fellow Italian filmmakers Payami released a reconstructed version of the film in the official program of the Venice International Film festival. In 2003 he was a member of the jury at the 25th Moscow International Film Festival. Since his exile, Payami taught at the Ludwigsburg Film Academy in Germany and conducted numerous workshops in Italy and North America while developing his English language film projects. In late 2007 and until January 2010, he was the creative director of the Media Studio at Fabrica, a United Colors of Benetton Communication Arts research Centre in Northern Italy. During his tenure at Fabrica he produced several projects including \\"I Am Jesus\\" directed by Valerie Gudenus and Heloisa Sartorato, \\"Branding Kosovo\\" directed by Diego Hurtado de Mendoza. Since 2006, Payami re-established Payam Films Inc. in Toronto with his partner Charles Wachsberg and began development of several projects including an original story he wrote on Caravaggio titled \\"Chiaroscuro\\", his adaptation of a Chingiz Aitmatov book titled \\"The Eternal Day\\", \\"Mina\\" and \\"Assassiyun\\" which he co-wrote with Toronto writer Ian Carpenter. In 2017 Babak Payami directed \\"Manhattan Undying\\" a Canadian feature film with American stars Luke Grimes and Sarah Roemer along with Canadian veterans Daniel Kash and Earl Pastko.

Her keel was laid down on 16 December 1920 by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation's Fore River Shipyard in Quincy, Massachusetts. She was launched on 30 April 1923 sponsored by Mrs. Henry A. Hutchins, Jr., and commissioned on 20 November 1924, Lieutenant John \\"Babe\\" BrownBlair, Clay, Jr. Silent Victory (Bantam, 1976). in command. Service history Following shakedown off the New England coast, S-42 departed New London, Connecticut, in January 1925 and moved south to Coco Solo, whence she operated, both in the Caribbean Sea and in the Pacific Ocean, until the spring of 1927. Then ordered to Hawaii, she cleared the Gulf of Panama in May, was refitted in California, and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 22 July. The following month, she joined other fleet units in searching for missing Dole Air Race competitors and, later in the year, returned to California. Overhaul followed; and, on 4 February 1928, she rejoined the Battle Force at San Diego, California, where she was based into 1930. In December of that year, S-42‚Äôs division was transferred to Pearl Harbor. She then operated in Hawaiian waters and during annual fleet problems, off the Panama Canal Zone and in the Caribbean. From 1932 through 1935, however, she rotated between those active duty operations with Submarine Division 11 and inactive periods with Reserve Submarine Division 14. In March 1936, S-42 was transferred back to the submarine base at Coco Solo, where she was homeported until ordered to New London in June 1941. From New London, she shifted to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and with others of her division, now Submarine Division 53, she underwent modernization overhaul. With more up-to-date equipment ‚Äî which did not include air conditioning ‚Äî and somewhat improved performance capabilities, she moved south to Bermuda in November and conducted training and patrol operations there into December. Then, after 7 June, she proceeded back to the Canal Zone. =World War II= During January 1942, S-42 conducted security patrols in the Pacific approaches to the Canal. In February, she prepared to join Allied forces in the southwest Pacific, and, in early March, she started out across the ocean. On 15 April, she arrived in Moreton Bay, Brisbane, Australia. There, Submarine Division 53 joined the S-boats of the Asiatic Fleet, forming TF 42\\\\. These World War I-designed submarines were to \\"fill the gap,\\" to impede Japanese progress in the Bismarck Archipelago and the Solomon Islands, until larger and better equipped fleet submarines could be sent to the area. Ten days after her arrival, S-42 (in the hands of Oliver G. Kirk, Annapolis Class of 1929)Blair, p.912. cleared Moreton Bay and headed north across the Coral Sea for her first war patrol. After reaching 15 degrees south, she ran submerged during the day and surfaced at night to recharge her batteries and allow a brief respite from the high temperatures and humidity of submerged running. On the afternoon of 3 May, she entered her assigned patrol area, and, that evening, she closed the coast of New Ireland. Two days later, she sighted, fired on, and missed a medium-sized tender off Cape St. George. On 6 May, she shifted eastward to patrol between Buka and the cape. On 11 May, off New Britain,Blair, p.222. she sighted the minelayer Okinoshima (damaged at the Battle of the Coral Sea)Blair, p.222. through driving rain. S-42 fired four torpedoes, scored with three; and sent the 4400-ton minelayer to the bottom. The action, begun at 04:39, was over by 04:52. By 05:15, enemy destroyers were closing S-42‚Äôs position. Within five minutes, they began dropping depth charges. At 11:30, the last depth charge attack took place. At 14:30, the last sound contact was made with the still searching enemy. Sea water leaked into the control room in increasing amounts, but S-42 remained submerged for another four hours. She then surfaced to repair some of the damage and recharge her batteries. When she submerged, she was unable to control her depth. She surfaced for further temporary repairs. At dawn, she dived successfully. Leaks in the control room, however, continued, and she headed home. That day, 12 May, she attempted to send a message to ComSubRon 5. Two days later, she was still attempting to raise Brisbane, sending her message via Port Moresby, Townsville, Queensland, and Honolulu, Hawaii. On 16 May, her port engine flooded, but was put back into commission, temporarily. On 17 May, she raised Dutch Harbor, whence her dispatches were relayed to Brisbane. Three days later, she arrived in Moreton Bay. On 3 July, S-42 departed Brisbane for her second patrol. On 12 July, prior to taking up her offensive role in St. George's Channel, she landed an agent at Adler Bay, near Rabaul. His first report, soon dispatched, warned her to avoid native canoes as the Japanese were paying well for information. Weather, however, proved to be the worst impediment, encountered as frequent rains and heavy seas hindered her hunting. On the night of 19 July, S-42 returned to Adler Bay; reembarked the Australian intelligence officer, then got underway for Brisbane, where she arrived on 28 July. During the first week in August, the Allied offensive began with the landings on Guadalcanal. Two weeks later, on 21 August, S-42 (now commanded by Harley K. Nauman, Class of 1934)Blair, p.913. headed for the Solomons to support the offensive by patrolling in the already bloodied and iron-filled waters of the Savo Island‚ÄìCape Esperance area. On 23 August, an engine room hatch, improperly latched, began to leak ‚Äî 15 gallons per hour at 90 feet. Wooden wedges were driven into the coaming, reducing the flow to a drip. S-42 continued on to the Solomons. She arrived on station five days later and remained into September; but ‚Äî without modern electronics, quick maneuverability, and speed ‚Äî she was unable to close the night convoys from Rabaul. Upkeep at Brisbane occupied the period between 19 September and 19 October. On 20 October, she headed for the Solomons to intercept traffic on the Rabaul-Faisi-Buin line, as well as lay mines.Blair, p.920. Assigned to Bougainville Strait, she again made many contacts, but was unable to score. On 2 November, she fired four torpedoes at a destroyer steaming in company with three others. An explosion was heard, but depth charge attacks precluded determining the results. On 5 November, she departed the area and made for the Fiji Islands. On 16 November, she moored in Suva harbor, where she was joined by others of her division and, on 1 December, she got underway to return to the United States. Transiting the Panama Canal in early January 1943, she proceeded to Cuba in February; provided antisubmarine warfare training services for newly commissioned destroyers through March, then continued on to Philadelphia, where she underwent overhaul and acquired air conditioning and radar. In late June, she departed Hampton Roads for San Diego, whence she sailed for the Aleutian Islands in mid-August. On 2 September, she departed Dutch Harbor for the Kuril Islands and her only North Pacific war patrol. Stopping en route at Attu, the forty-day patrol was spent primarily in the Paramushiro-Onekotan area, and contributed no sinkings or damage. She returned to Dutch Harbor on 12 October. On 23 November, she departed again. En route to her assigned area, her port engine seized, and her patrol was cancelled. On 27 November, she put into Massacre Bay, Attu, where she remained for repairs into January 1944. In February, she returned to Dutch Harbor thence proceeded to Pearl Harbor and another tour in the southwest Pacific. S-42 arrived at Milne Bay, New Guinea, on 19 March. There, through May, she provided target services to ships conducting antisubmarine warfare exercises. In June, she shifted to Seeadler Harbor in the Admiralty Islands; provided similar services until 1 August; then prepared for her last war patrol. Five days later, she got underway for Halmahera with a four-man Australian intelligence team embarked. On 15, 21, and 22 August, members of the team were landed, singly, at designated points. These men were to contact and pick up other agents previously landed. On 26 August, the scout landed at Gorango Bay was recovered alone. He had been unable to contact his assigned agent. The other scouts were not recovered. On 3 September, S-42 returned to Seeadler Harbor. Resuming ASW training duties, S-42 remained in the Admiralties into October. At mid-month, she arrived at Brisbane for overhaul; and, in January 1945, she returned to the Admiralties. In mid-February, she departed Manus for California, arriving at San Diego at the end of March. There, she provided training services for the West Coast Sound School through the end of World War II. In September, she shifted to San Francisco, California, where she was decommissioned on 25 October 1945. Stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 13 November, she was sold for scrapping in November 1946. S-42 earned one battle star during World War II.

The Cinemascope film was directed by Burt Balaban and Stuart Rosenberg. The screenplay was based on the true story of Murder, Inc., a Brooklyn gang that operated in the 1930s. Falk plays Abe Reles, a vicious thug who led the Murder, Inc. gang and was believed to have committed 30 murders, for which he never was prosecuted. The film was the first major feature role for Falk, who was nominated for a best supporting actor Oscar for his performance. In his 2006 autobiography Just One More Thing, Falk said that Murder, Inc. launched his career. This was the first film directed by Rosenberg, who later won acclaim for Cool Hand Luke (1967), and it launched Stuart Whitman's career as a leading man. A highly fictionalized film on the same basic events titled The Enforcer (1951), starring Humphrey Bogart, was released in the United Kingdom with the title Murder, Inc. Plot summary Abe Reles (Peter Falk) and Bug Workman (Warren Finnerty), two killers from Brooklyn's Brownsville district, meet in the Garment District to meet with Louis \\"Lepke\\" Buchalter, kingpin of an organized crime mob, who hires them as the syndicate's hit men. Their first job is to kill Walter Sage (Morey Amsterdam), a resort owner who has been holding back slot machine profits from Lepke. To get close to Sage, Reles forces singer Joey Collins (Stuart Whitman), an old crony of Sage who owes Reles money, to help him. Reles and his henchman kill Sage. Reles visits Joey and threatens to kill him and his dancer wife Eadie (May Britt) if they tell anyone about the murder. Eadie throws Reles out. Reles later returns to the apartment when Joey is gone and brutally rapes her. Despite her urging Joey refuses to run away, and this causes him and Eadie to split. Reles continues to make assassinations at Lepke's direction. Reles reconciles with the couple by giving them a luxurious apartment filled with stolen goods. Under police pressure, Lepke hides from the police at Joey and Eadie's new apartment. He treats Eadie like a maid. District Attorney Burton Turkus (Henry Morgan) takes over the law enforcement campaign against Murder, Inc., enlisting local Brownsville police detective Tobin (Simon Oakland). Lepke orders the death of the entire Brownsville gang as well as Joey and Eadie. Eadie visits Turkus and becomes an informant as does Joey. He then confronts Reles, who has been arrested, in his cell, and threatens to testify against him. In fear of this testimony, Reles agrees to testify against Lepke in exchange for reduced charges. He provides a detailed account of the activities of Murder, Inc. Turkus puts Joey and Reles in protective custody and hides them at the Half Moon Hotel in Coney Island. Eadie comes to visit Joey, imploring him to testify against Lepke. Joey is reluctant, fearing the mob will kill Eadie in revenge. Despondent, Eadie slips her police escort and wanders alone on the beachfront, where she is murdered. Later that night, Reles is thrown out the window by an assassin. Joey avenges his wife's death by testifying against Lepke, who is executed.

Vincent Gardenia plays a small role. Original book Twentieth Century-Fox based Murder, Inc. on a 1951 book of the same title by Burton Turkus, former district attorney of New York, and Sid Feder. It is similar in style to the popular TV series The Untouchables, which may have inspired the studio to make the movie. The story of the Murder, Inc. crime group was first told on the screen in the Warner Brothers film The Enforcer, a semi-fictional film that was released as Murder, Inc. overseas. The film starred Humphrey Bogart, in his last role for the studio, as a crusading district attorney in the mold of Turkus. A Lepke-type character was played by Everett Sloane. Ted De Corsia played a character loosely based on Reles. The films differ in that Murder, Inc. is factual and dealt with a Mafia kingpin's establishment of a contract murder organization within that framework, and The Enforcer is fictional and had a freelance group willing to work for anyone in or out of the mob. The 1951 film begins with De Corsia's falling off a ledge despite Bogart's attempt to save him, and includes gruesome scenes based on fact. Production The novel was optioned by Burt Balaban's Princess Pictures. Balaban was the son of Paramount executive Barney Balaban. It was made in associated with Robert L. Lippert's Associate Productions and 20th Century Fox. =Casting= Murder, Inc. was filmed in and around New York City, and the cast consisted largely of actors from the off- Broadway theater. Peter Falk recalled in his autobiography Just One More Thing that the film was \\"no big deal for Twentieth Century Fox. They hired second- tier stars, nobody had ever heard of them. The cast of off-Broadway stage actors, including me, came cheap. A few dollars a week and a bag of peanuts.\\" Stuart Rosenberg, who had been directing for Alfred Hitchcock Presents, was signed to make his feature debut as director. Robert Evans, who later became head of production at Paramount Pictures Corporation but at the time was a young actor, was offered the part of Reles and turned it down. In an interview with The Guardian in 2002, Evans said: > I was hot as an actor for a few minutes and I turned down parts that got > guys nominated for Academy Awards. For example, there was a picture called > Murder, Inc. which was to star Stuart Whitman, May Britt and myself. I said > \\"If I'm not going to lead, then I'm not going to play the part.\\" and got a > suspension. And they hired an actor who had never been north of 14th Street > in New York and had never been to Hollywood ‚Äì this guy called Peter Falk. > And he was nominated for the part that I went on suspension for. Falk had appeared in Kraft Mystery Theatre. He showed his performance to Balaban who decided to cast him. Falk said that \\"for me, Murder, Inc. was more than a big deal ‚Äì it was a miracle. Like being touched from above. Of all the thousands of obscure actors, they picked me.\\" Were it not for being cast in the film, he said he would not have been cast in his subsequent films A Pocketful of Miracles (1961) and Robin and the Seven Hoods (1964). He said Murder, Inc. \\"made my career\\". Had he not been selected to portray Reles, he said, he still would be in the off-Broadway theater. =Shooting= Filming started 15 February 1960. It took place at Filmways Studio and location at Manhattan and Brooklyn. Falk chose his wardrobe for the film from second-hand clothing stores, going from store to store until he got the right coat and hat, to give him the \\"East Coast 'wise guy' look\\". He patterned his performance as Reles on would-be gangsters whom he knew in his youth at a pool hall named McGuire's. \\"I had a real feel for these guys ‚Äì the way they talked ‚Äì the gestures ‚Äì the whole package.\\" Falk said that he rewrote the part and that Rosenberg gave him the latitude to depart from the script. According to Falk, production of the movie was accelerated because of an impending actor's strike. Rosenberg was fired and replaced by Balaban, who had no experience as a director. Falk said that Balaban \\"stayed out of the way\\" while the crew and cast did their jobs. In Bullets Over Hollywood, a 2005 study of gangster movies, film scholar John McCarty stated that the \\"presence of two helmsmen may explain the uneven qualities of the film\\", in which scenes of powerful impact are \\"offset by long expanses of unexciting celluloid\\". Filming was to have taken 20 days, but because of the strike, it was decided to film it in nine days by extending the shooting days from 9 am to 11 pm, working on weekends, and rearranging the schedule. On 27 February 1960, Balaban took over as director from Rosenberg, and Gaine Rescher replaced Joseph Brun as cinematographer. Production of the movie took place up to the very last moments before the actor's strike. The last scene to be shot was the murder of Walter Sage, portrayed by Morey Amsterdam. Because of the shortage of time, the scene, set in the Catskill Mountains, was shot outside the studio on 126th Street in Harlem. The Sage execution was filmed minutes before the start of the strike at midnight.  Reception  = Critical response = New York Times film critic Bosley Crowther dismissed the film as a \\"new screen telling of an old story\\". Crowther singled out Falk's \\"amusingly vicious performance\\", and that when he appears \\"there is a certain dark frightfulness and terror\\" in the film. But \\"otherwise the traffic is that of an average gangster film that slacks off too much for proper tension and runs a great deal too long.\\" Crowther praised the other leading performances but said that Morgan, a radio and TV personality known mainly for his sharp wit, \\"does better when he is telling jokes\\". Describing Falk's performance, Crowther wrote: > Mr. Falk, moving as if weary, looking at people out of the corners of his > eyes and talking as if he had borrowed Marlon Brando's chewing gum, seems a > travesty of a killer, until the water suddenly freezes in his eyes and he > whips an icepick from his pocket and starts punching holes in someone's > ribs. Then viciousness pours out of him and you get a sense of a felon who > is hopelessly cracked and corrupt.\\" More recent reviewers have praised Falk's performance, but have not lavished much praise on the movie, with commentators divided on the film's semi- documentary style. A 1986 study of films as art praised the film's \\"journalistic thoroughness\\" and \\"teledramatic immediacy\\". Falk's performance, it stated, \\"is one of the grittiest portrayals of the primitivism of an underworld henchman on film; the supporting relationships of Whitman's cowardly, acquiescent innocent and May Britt's beleaguered wife perversely juxtaposed to the unusual pathos generated by the crime boss and his aide delineate the glumness of the crime world with few concessions to moral righteousness\\". In the 1997 book Crime Movies, film historian Carlos Clarens compared Murder, Inc. unfavorably to Samuel Fuller's Underworld USA (1961), released at about the same time, on the grounds that it stuck too closely to the facts. Falk, he wrote, delivered a \\"miscalculated comic performance\\" as Reles, and \\"the power and resonance of The Enforcer was missing, chiefly because the facts tyrannized the weak screenplay\\". In contrast, the book states Underworld USA was a \\"free and colorful fiction\\" that \\"packed the visual and dramatic wallop of an atrocity photo in the National Enquirer\\". DVD Review called Murder, Inc. \\"an entertaining, if somewhat trifling, piece of violent fluff\\". It wrote that \\"Peter Falk walks away with the movie anyway. Falk was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Academy Award for this film, and it is easy to see why. He imbues his role with the sleazy charisma and rugged charm that would later become his trademark on the long-running 'Columbo.'\\" Another reviewer wrote in 2001 that \\"the best thing about the film was Falk's tough-guy performance. Otherwise, everything was routine.\\" In 2005, film scholar John McCarty praised Falk's performance and David J. Stewart's \\"reptilian\\" Lepke, and wrote \\"the film belongs to Stewart and Falk; as with Daniel Day-Lewis in Gangs of New York, it is mostly when they are on the screen that this minor but engaging docudrama about the mob's ugly but profitable murder-for-hire business really cooks.\\" The stylistic score by Frank De Vol was well received. It is included in the soundtrack album of the film, released by Canadian-American Records in the same year as the film release. = Accolades = Falk was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance as Reles. It was the film's only Academy Award nomination. Falk unsuccessfully campaigned for the award. In a 1997 interview with writer Arthur Marx, Falk said that the idea of campaigning for the award was suggested by Sal Mineo, but that he did not take the idea seriously until it was suggested by Abe Lastfogel, head of the William Morris Agency. He hired a press agent \\"and what do you know ‚Äì I got nominated.\\" Falk described what happened at the award ceremonies as follows: > \\"Now we're in our seats; the press agent, Judd Bernard, is seated on my > right. It's my category and I heard a voice say 'And the winner is > Peter...I'm rising out of my seat... Ustinov.' I'm heading back down. When I > hit the seat, I turn to the press agent: 'You're fired.' I didn't want him > charging me for another day.\\"  See also  * List of American films of 1960  References  External links  1960 films 1960 crime drama films 20th Century Fox films American crime drama films American films American black-and-white films English-language films Films scored by Frank De Vol Films about capital punishment Films about Italian-American organized crime Films about Jewish-American organized crime Films directed by Stuart Rosenberg Films set in New York City Films set in Brooklyn Films set in the 1930s Films shot in New York City American police detective films Murder, Inc.

The design of each type of handle involves substantial ergonomic issues, even where these are dealt with intuitively or by following tradition. Handles for tools are an important part of their function, enabling the user to exploit the tools to maximum effect. Package handles allow for convenient carrying of packages. A modern claw hammer with rubber handle  General design criteria  Flat-nose pliers with thermoplastic handles The three nearly universal requirements of are: # Sufficient strength to support the object, or to otherwise transmit the force involved in the task the handle serves. # Sufficient length to permit the hand or hands gripping it to reliably exert that force. # Sufficiently small circumference to permit the hand or hands to surround it far enough to grip it as solidly as needed to exert that force.  Specific needs  Other requirements may apply to specific handles: * A sheath or coating on the handle that provides friction against the hand, reducing the gripping force needed to achieve a reliable grip. * Designs such as recessed car-door handles, reducing the chance of accidental operation, or simply the inconvenience of \\"snagging\\" the handle. * Sufficient circumference to distribute the force comfortably and safely over the hand. An example where this requirement is almost the sole purpose for a handle's existence is the handle that consists of two pieces: a hollow wooden cylinder about the diameter of a finger and a bit longer than one hand-width, and a stiff wire that passes through the center of the cylinder, has two right angles, and is shaped into a hook at each end. This handle permits comfortable carrying, with otherwise bare hands, of a heavy package, suspended on a tight string that passes around the top and bottom of it: the string is strong enough to support it, but the pressure the string would exert on fingers that grasped it directly would often be unacceptable. * Design to thwart unwanted access, for example, by children or thieves. In these cases many of the other requirements may have reduced importance. For example, a child-proof doorknob can be difficult for even an adult to use. Pull handles Many drawers use pull handles. One major category of handles are pull handles, where one or more hands grip the handle or handles, and exert force to shorten the distance between the hands and their corresponding shoulders. The three criteria stated above are universal for pull handles. Many pull handles are for lifting, mostly on objects to be carried. Horizontal pull handles are widespread, including drawer pulls, handles on latchless doors and the outside of car doors. The inside controls for opening car doors from inside are usually pull handles, although their function of permitting the door to be pushed open is accomplished by an internal unlatching linkage. Pull handles are also a frequent host of common door handle bacteria such as e-coli, fungal or other viral infections.Door Handles Can Spread Germs retrieved November 2016 Two kinds of pull handles may involve motion in addition to the hand-focused motions described: * Pulling the starting cord on a small internal-combustion engine may, besides moving the hand toward the shoulder, also exploit simultaneously pushing a wheeled vehicle away with the other hand, stepping away from the engine, and/or standing from a squat. * Some throwing motions, as in a track-and-field hammer throw, involve pulling on a handle against centrifugal force (without bringing it closer), in the course of accelerating the thrown object by forcing it into circular motion. Twist handles Many doors use twist handles. Another category of hand-operated device requires grasping (but not pulling) and rotating the hand and either the lower arm or the whole arm, about their axis. When the grip required is a fist grip, as with a door handle that has an arm rather than a knob to twist, the term \\"handle\\" unambiguously applies. Another clear case is a rarer device seen on mechanically complicated doors like those of airliners, where (instead of the whole hand moving down as it also rotates, on the door handles just described) the axis of rotation is between the thumb and the outermost fingers, so the thumb moves up if the outer fingers move down. Handles for wide-range motion The handles of bicycle grips, club-style weapons, shovels and spades, axes, hammers, mallets and hatchets, baseball bats, rackets, golf clubs, and croquet mallets involve a greater range of ergonomic issues.

The screenplay by Hal Kanter and Harry Tugend is based on the screenplay of the 1933 film Lady for a Day by Robert Riskin, which was adapted from the 1929 Damon Runyon short story \\"Madame La Gimp\\". That original 1933 film was also directed by Capra, one of two films that he originally directed and later remade, the other being Broadway Bill (1934), and its remake Riding High (1950) The film proved to be the final project for both Capra and veteran actor Thomas Mitchell but also featured the film debut of Ann-Margret. Supporting player Peter Falk was nominated for an Academy Award but George Chakiris won that year for West Side Story. The 1989 film Miracles starring Jackie Chan and Anita Mui, and the 2008 film Singh Is Kinng starring Akshay Kumar and Katrina Kaif are based on Pocketful of Miracles. Plot Dave the Dude (Glenn Ford) is a successful, very superstitious New York City gangster who buys apples from street peddler Apple Annie (Bette Davis) to bring him good luck. On the eve of a very important meeting, he finds Annie terribly upset. Annie, it turns out, has a daughter named Louise (Ann-Margret), who was sent to a school in Europe as a baby, but is now a grown woman. Louise believes her mother to be wealthy socialite Mrs. E. Worthington Manville, and she is bringing her aristocratic fianc√© Carlos and his father, Count Alfonso Romero (Arthur O'Connell), to meet her. Annie has been pretending that she resides in a luxurious hotel (writing her letters on stolen hotel stationery) and has Louise's letters mailed there, then intercepted by a friend and handed over to her. Dave's good-hearted girlfriend Queenie Martin (Hope Lange) persuades him to help Annie continue her charade. Queenie takes on the task of transforming the derelict into a dowager. Dave arranges for cultured pool hustler \\"Judge\\" Henry G. Blake (Thomas Mitchell) to pose as Annie's husband. He installs her in an out-of-town friend's suite in the hotel, complete with Hudgins (Edward Everett Horton), his friend's butler. When Dave keeps postponing a meeting with an extremely powerful gangster to help Annie, his right-hand man Joy Boy (Peter Falk) becomes increasingly exasperated. Dave manages to engineer a lavish reception with New York's mayor and governor as guests. Louise and her impressed future husband and father-in-law return to Europe, none the wiser about her mother's real identity.

In the mid-1950s, when Hal Wallis offered to buy it as a Paramount Pictures vehicle for Shirley Booth, Columbia head Harry Cohn decided to offer it to Capra instead, hoping he could lure Booth to his studio. Unable to persuade either Abe Burrows or Garson Kanin to update the plot, Capra began working on the screenplay himself. His modern version, which involved Korean War orphans and an apple farm in Oregon, was filled with Cold War rhetoric and retitled Ride the Pink Cloud. Cohn insisted Capra find a collaborator, but he thought the draft submitted by Harry Tugend was no better, and he dropped the project. In 1960, Capra bought the screen rights from Columbia for $225,000, and the director made a deal with United Artists, where it was decided to film the story as a period piece set in the 1930s. Capra originally cast Frank Sinatra as Dave the Dude, but the actor walked out due to disagreements about the script. Kirk Douglas, Dean Martin, and Jackie Gleason rejected the role. Then Glenn Ford approached Capra with an offer to help finance the film through his production company if he was cast as the lead. The director felt Ford was wrong for the part but out of desperation he agreed to the arrangement, which called for each of them to receive 37¬Ω percent of the film's profits. Ford was paid $350,000 up front, but Capra received only $200,000. Because the film never earned back its cost, he lost an additional $50,000 in deferred salary. Hope Lange as Queenie MartinBudgeted at $2.9 million, the film began principal photography on April 20, 1961. Cast as Apple Annie was Bette Davis, who accepted the role after Shirley Booth, Helen Hayes, Katharine Hepburn, and Jean Arthur turned it down. Davis was undergoing financial difficulties, and the need for the $100,000 paycheck overshadowed her concern about making her Hollywood comeback (her last American film had been Storm Center in 1956) in the role of an elderly hag. From the beginning, she clashed with co-star Glenn Ford, who had demanded Hope Lange, his girlfriend at the time, be given the dressing room adjacent to his, one that had been assigned to Davis. Davis graciously insisted any dressing room she was given would be adequate, noting \\"Dressing rooms have never been responsible for the success of a film.\\" Despite her effort to avoid an unpleasant situation, Davis was given the room Lange had wanted, and from then on Ford began treating her like a supporting player. In an interview, he suggested he was so grateful to Davis for the support she had given him during the filming of A Stolen Life in 1946, he had insisted she be cast as Apple Annie in order to revive her sagging career, a condescending remark Davis never forgot or forgave. Because of Ford's involvement with the financing of the film, Capra refused to intervene in any of the disagreements between the two stars, but he suffered blinding and frequently incapacitating headaches as a result of the stress. Ann Margret was paid $1,500 a week.Meet Ann-Margret: Hard Work, Ambition Propel a Young Actress To the Top in Hollywood By DAVID H. KELSEY Wall Street Journal 7 Apr 1964: 1. Filming was completed in late June 1961, and Capra painfully struggled to get through the post-production period. Upon its completion, he professed to prefer the remake to the original, although most critics, and in later years film historians and movie buffs, disagreed with his assessment. Reception The critic for The Hollywood Reporter was one of the few reviewers to look upon the film favorably, calling it \\"a Christmas sockful of joy, funny, sentimental, romantic [and] frankly capricious.\\" In The New York Times, A.H. Weiler noted, \\"Mr. Capra and his energetic troupe manage to get a fair share of laughs from Mr. Runyon's oddball guys and dolls, but their lampoon is dated and sometimes uneven and listless . . . Repetition and a world faced by grimmer problems seem to have been excessively tough competition for this plot.\\" Variety thought the plot \\"alternates uneasily between wit and sentiment\\" and added, \\"The picture seems too long, considering that there's never any doubt as to the outcome, and it's also too lethargic, but there are sporadic compensations of line and situation that reward the patience. Fortunately Capra has assembled some of Hollywood's outstanding character players for the chore . . . The best lines in the picture go to Peter Falk...[who] just about walks off with the film when he's on.\\" In Films in Review, Elaine Rothschild stated \\"this unbelievable and unfunny comedy proves only that director Frank Capra has learned nothing and forgotten nothing in the 28 years that intervened between the two pictures. Pocketful of Miracles is not merely out of whole cloth, but out of date, and watching it is a painful experience.\\" Exhibitors protested Bette Davis's star billing as they considered it would negatively impact the box office performance and, despite the appearance of Glenn Ford, the film failed at the box office.

It was first built by Shin Mitsubishi Heavy-Industries, one of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries' three regional automotive companies until they were merged in 1964, and as such predates MMC itself. In Japan, it was sold at a specific retail chain called Galant Shop. In 2011, the car was replaced with the Mitsubishi eK. __TOC__ First generation =Mitsubishi 360= The precursor of the Minica was the Mitsubishi 360, a series of light trucks introduced in April 1961. Designed for the lowest kei car vehicle tax classification, it was powered by an air- cooled 359 cc, engine, providing a lowly top speed but with a fully syncromeshed four-speed transmission. After the successful 1962 introduction of the passenger car version, called Minica, the 360 van and pickup continued alongside the Minica, sharing its development.360cc Light Commercial Truck, pp 84-85 The Mitsubishi 360/Minica competed with the established Subaru 360, Daihatsu Fellow Max, and the Suzuki Fronte in the late sixties. The somewhat unexpected success of the 360/Minica led Mitsubishi to end production of three-wheeled vehicles. Originally available as a panel van or light van (really a Station Wagon, but registered as a commercial vehicle for tax purposes), with a pickup version added in October, the Mitsubishi 360 was rather quaintly styled. Suicide doors and a swage line which continued across the hood were often accented by whitewall tires and lace curtains (both standard on the Light Van DeLuxe, introduced in April 1962) to complete the picture. The 360 and Minica were given a thorough facelift in November 1964, with an entirely new front clip with a pressed metal chrome grill. The more modern look was accompanied by the new, somewhat more powerful ME24 engine, affording a top speed of . The four-seat version of the light van (LT21-4) could carry , while the strict two-seater (LT20) could take a full . In August 1966, the Mitsubishi Minicab cab-over pickup truck was launched to complement the Mitsubishi 360 light truck. Powered by the same air-cooled two-stroke 359 cc engine as the Minica, it came with cargo gates on three sides to simplify loading and unloading. In December, the 360 received a less ornate grille. In May 1967, the 360 and Minica were both updated with the new 21 PS ME24D, increasing top speed to . In September 1968 a Super Deluxe version of the light van was added, featuring a new plastic grille and more modern interior. At the same time, the pickup dropped the \\"360\\" model name and was from now on sold as the \\"Minica Pick\\" („Éü„Éã„Ç´„Éî„ÉÉ„ÇØ, Minika Pikku). By 1969, the new Minica Van had superseded the LT23 and it was no longer produced, although the LT25 pickup continued to be built until 1971 (at least). These late models have the air-cooled ME24E engine with , although top speed remained . It also has the same blacked-out plastic grille as fitted to the Super Deluxe and late first- generation Minicas. =Minica Sedan= The first Minica (LA20) was first introduced in October 1962 as a two-door sedan based on the Mitsubishi 360 light truck, sharing its front-mounted ME21 359 cc twin-cylinder air-cooled engine driving the rear wheels, transverse leaf springs in front and beam axle/leaf springs at the rear.Nippon Memorial, p.60 Top speed was marginally higher at . With its tailfins and scalloped rear windshield, the Minica looked even more anachronistic than its van/pickup counterparts. In November 1964 the Minica (and 360) received a fairly thorough facelift and the improved ME24 engine (LA21). Power output was up by one, to , with the new \\"Auto Mix\\" system removing the need for premixing oil and gasoline. In December 1966, along with a slightly different grille and new badging, a basic \\"Standard\\" Minica sedan was added, while the regular version was promoted to \\"Deluxe\\". Prices were ¬•340,000 and ¬•368,000 respectively.Nippon Memorial, p.63 In May 1967, the Minica was given another minor update, with a modified dashboard and a padded center to steering wheel. The engine was also upgraded, with the new reed valve ME24D providing a useful 21 PS.Nippon Memorial, p.66 In September of the following year, a Super Deluxe grade was added, using the new water-cooled 2G10 engine developed for the next-generation Minica.Ozeki, Memories, p 101 This (the LA23) also featured a full vinyl interior and a new plastic grille (as on the Mitsubishi 360 van pictured above). With the July 1969 introduction of the second-generation Minica, the LA series was discontinued. Second generation The second-generation Minica 70 was introduced in July 1969 with coil springs front and rear, a five-link rigid rear axle, and a three-door sedan body featuring the new \\"Wing-Flow Line\\" style. The new design was much more appealing to young buyers than the dated and corny looks of earlier Minicas, and the rear hatch was a Kei class first. Two 359 cc 2G10 water- cooled two-stroke powerplants were optionally available (A101), either the Red engine (Super Deluxe, Sporty Deluxe) or the Gold engine fitted with twin SU carburetors developing . The Gold engine, introduced in December 1969, was fitted as standard to the SS and GSS sport models introduced at the same time. The basic Standard and Deluxe versions (A100) were still fitted with the old ME24E air-cooled engine Yellow engine, for a top speed of .60s Car Archive, p. 21, 70s Car Archive, p. 69-70, Nippon Memorial, p. 72-73, Ozeki, Memories, p. 30, 97, 102-108. The better equipped Hi-Deluxe version also appeared in December 1969. A two-door wagon body was also added in December 1969 and was to remain in production until its eventual replacement by the Minica Econo in 1981. In October 1970 the ME24F Yellow engine gained four horsepower for a total of (the Van did not receive this upgrade) while the Red engine went up to . The GSS version gained integrated foglights and four round headlight, while the SS was discontinued at the same time. A luxurious GL version was also introduced for 1971, featuring high-back bucket seats in front. In February 1971 a very minor facelift meant the car was now called Minica 71. In addition to more aggressive, wider taillights and some trim changes, one could now get the water-cooled 2G10 engine in the lower priced Family Deluxe.Nippon Memorial, p. 78 The Minica Skipper (A101C) was introduced in May 1971 as a two-door coup√© with liftable rear window, and a choice of Red or Gold 2G10 engines. The Skipper was available either as the S/L, L/L or GT. This also meant that the GSS sedan was gradually becoming obsolete, as the focus of the sportier Minicas shifted to the coup√© versions. Styling wise, the Skipper represented a miniature version of the seminal hardtop Mitsubishi Galant GTO. To allow for a combination of fastback styling with rearward visibility, a secondary small rear window was placed on the back panel, √† la the Maserati Khamsin and Honda CR-X. The top rear window opened for access to the luggage area, which featured a folding rear seat. Besides chassis and internals, the Skipper shared the front clip and lower door panels with the sedan.70s Car Archive, p. 73. By September 1971, with the introduction of the Minica 72, the sedan versions were no longer available with the powerful Gold engine. Changes were limited to a new honeycomb grille, taillights (incorporating amber turnsignals) and a new dash similar to that of the Skipper.Nippon Memorial, p. 81. The Sporty Deluxe version was also discontinued. In October 1972 the 2nd- generation Minica received its last facelift, becoming the Minica 73 to soldier on for another year as a low-cost alternative to the new F4. Sold either as a Standard or a Deluxe, only the de-tuned 31 PS (2G10-5) Red engine also used in the Van versions was now available, placing the \\"73\\" firmly at the bottom of the Minica lineup. There were no more air-cooled Minicas available. One year later, a Van Custom was added, with four headlights and more extensive equipment. In late 1974 or early 1975 the Van was updated to accept new larger license plates that were now required. The Van continued with the two-stroke 2G10-5 engine until being replaced by the bigger-engined Minica 5 Van (A104V) in March 1976. 1973 Minica Skipper IV Also in October 1972 the renamed Skipper IV (A102) received the new four-stroke 2G21 engine from the Minica F4, with either 32 or 36 PS.Le Salon de l'Auto 1973, p. 207 A new F/L replaced the S/L in the lineup. Along with some safety improvements in October 1973 both engines were replaced by the \\"Vulcan S\\" engine, as the Skipper IV lineup was further narrowed. The coup√© continued in production until July (or perhaps December) 1974, but ever more strangled by emissions regulations its market had by then shrunk to almost nothing. =The Van lives on= The Minica Van, based on the 1969 Minica 70, lived a long life until eventually replaced by the Minica Econo in 1981. Starting with the air-cooled A100V, it was replaced by the water-cooled A101V in late 1972. There was no A102 nor A103 van, as the A101V remained available only with the air-cooled \\"Red\\" two-stroke engine until the introduction of the Minica 5 Van (A104V) in March 1976. This was soon followed by the bigger engined \\"Minica 55 Van\\" (A105V), which has the newer 2G23 engine with at 5500 rpm. The 55 Van was available in a few different equipment levels, from the Standard at the bottom to the Super Deluxe on top. Third generation The third-generation Minica was introduced as the Minica F4 (A103A) in October 1972 with a 359 cc OHC engine in the same layout, but featuring a liftable clam-shell rear window as on the coup√©. The Skipper continued in production, as of October 1973 with the new engine (becoming the Minica Skipper IV). The new four-stroke Vulcan 2G21 MCA engine (Mitsubishi Clean Air) was much cleaner than, but not as smooth running as its two-stroke predecessors. The six single-carb-engined versions provided while the twin-carb version listed for the GS and GSL models offered . The Van range continued to use the previous body. In late 1973, facing shrinking Kei-car sales, Mitsubishi narrowed the Minica F4 range down to four equipment levels (Hi-Standard, Deluxe, GL and SL), with the cheaper versions featuring a new grille. The sporty versions were discontinued, as the twin- carb engine fell foul of new emissions regulations. The modified Vulcan S engine came equipped with a balance shaft (later baptised \\"Silent Shaft\\") and was cleaner yet, hence the \\"MCA-II\\" tag. Power, however, was down to 30 PS. Top speed was . In December 1974, the lineup was again revamped, with the GL and SL becoming the Super Deluxe and Custom.Nippon Memorial, p.90 Mitsubishi also lightly redesigned the Minica to accept the new, bigger license plates now required for Kei cars. In May 1976 (March for the Minica 5 Van), corresponding to revised kei car regulations of January 1976 (length up to 3.2 m, width to 1.4 m and engine size to 550 cc) both the sedan and the van received a new long-stroke 471 cc engine, a small increase in length (entirely due to new, larger bumpers), and a new name, the Minica 5. Both models were also lightly facelifted, featuring new grilles, while equipment levels remained the same. While power output of the new Vulcan 2G22 did not change for the sedan (A104A), the van (A104V) received a lower powered version thereof. The Minica 5 was a mere interim model, anticipating the more thoroughly revised Minica Ami 55 which was soon to arrive. Fourth generation In June 1977 the car and engine grew once again, creating the Minica Ami 55. While the side body panels remained the same, length increased yet a little more (3175 mm) and the entire car was widened by . The updated 546 cc Vulcan 2G23 engine provided for the A105A. Its sibling, the Minica 55 Van (A105V) was updated in March 1977 and was almost impossible to distinguish from the previous Minica 5 Van, aside from badging and a slightly less plasticky front end. The bigger engine provided some useful additional torque, but the sporting Minicas of the early seventies were now a memory. The traditional (and unusual amongst Kei cars) Panhard layout remained. Minica Ami 55 XL September 1978 brought another engine upgrade: The new \\"Vulcan II\\" G23B featured the lean burn MCA-Jet emissions control system with a hemispherical head, aluminium rocker arms and three valves per cylinder, but power outputs remained static. The model code became A106, with A106V used for the van which continued to use the bodywork of the second generation. In September 1981 the car received another redesign. An entire new rear end meant a slightly longer wheelbase (up to 2,050 mm) and a somewhat longer and taller body. The somewhat boxy rear end, still with a clamshell rear window, looked a bit incongruous paired with the original Minica F4 front wings and doors. The new Minica was renamed the Minica Ami L (A107A), but bigger news was that the Minica 55 Van, based on the 1969 A100V, was finally retired. The new A107V Minica Econo (\\"Econo\\" hinting at its primary use as a private economy car rather than as a commercial vehicle) looked very similar to the Ami L but featured a proper rear hatch and folding rear seat, allowing it to be registered as a light commercial vehicle like its competitors the Daihatsu Mira, Suzuki Alto and Subaru Rex. Cargo capacity, compared to the more workmanlike Minica 55 Van, was reduced from 300 to . A two-speed, semi-automatic gearbox was also available on all models, while the standard four-speed manual received lower gearing for the Econo model. The engine was more quiet than before, featuring a milder cam profile. Power output of the G23B remained the same, although the Econo was stuck with a version of the old 2G23 engine. Top speed of the Ami was . In December 1981 a strict two-seater version of the Econo was added. One year later, the Minica was sold with the new \\"MMC\\" logo rather than the old \\"three diamonds\\". In March 1983 the Minica Ami L Turbo became the first kei car to be offered with a turbocharger, offering and glitzy graphics. This proved short-lived, as by January 1984 production of the A107 Minicas had ended, with Mitsubishi preparing for the release of an all new, front-wheel drive Minica. Fifth generation The fifth-generation Minica was introduced in February 1984 as a front engined, front wheel drive vehicle for the first time. It offered three- and five-door configurations, increased size and a torsion beam/coil spring rear suspension. With its \\"tall-boy\\" design it was much more spacious inside. It retained the G23B engine, but modernized with a timing belt rather than the old noisy timing chain. The Minica sedan had , the sparsely trimmed Econo commercial version , and the Turbo gained an intercooler and now offered . Air conditioning finally became an option. Reflecting the design improvements, Mitsubishi advertised the car as a worthy competitor for the considerably larger cars of the one-litre class. A considerable improvement on the old model, sales of the passenger model tripled year-on-year in its first month on the market. Sales of the Econo doubled. Mitsubishi Minca Econo Turbo ZEO (H14V) In September 1985 a four- wheel drive model with a live rear axle was introduced. In January 1988, as the bubble economy and the kei-class horsepower war were both heating up, an aero-kit version of the Turbo was introduced to compete with Suzuki's Alto Works and Daihatsu's Mira Turbo TR-XX. Called the Turbo ZEO it was equipped with the same carburetted engine as the regular Turbo model; sales were low. There was also a low-priced, well-equipped version of the Minica Econo called the Tico, as well as a new top-of-the-line five-door sedan called the Minica Exceed. This generation was the first to reach export markets, usually labelled Mitsubishi Towny, originally with a two-cylinder 783 cc engine and a four-speed manual transmission. Later (1987) it received a three-cylinder 796 cc engine with and a five-speed gearbox (also locally manufactured by CMC in Taiwan, only as a five-door); a three-door panel van was also marketed abroad. Sixth generation In January 1989 the sixth-generation Minica (H21/H22 for front- and four-wheel-drive models respectively) was officially introduced, although the engine, wheelbase, and suspension remained unchanged. In addition to the three-door vans (hatchbacks presumably intended for commercial use) and five-door \\"sedans\\" (hatchbacks for private use), a variant with a single door on the right side, two doors on the passenger side, and a liftgate was introduced, named the Minica Lettuce. This was originally a van with a foldable rear seat and flat loading floor, to meet special tax breaks available, but in May 1989 the tax benefits were lowered and the Lettuce became classified as a sedan. A three-door passenger version was introduced at the same time. The asymmetric Minica Lettuce was developed together with the Seiyu supermarket chain, which also sold the car directly. It was meant specifically to simplify the loading of children and shopping. The Minica Lettuce (H21V), notice the two doors on the left side and a single door on the right An advanced new turbo engine with double overhead cams and the world's first mass-produced five-valve-per-cylinder engine was introduced for the Dangan ZZ model, producing . The Dangan was originally a commercial vehicle, but became a passenger car in August 1989. It was later made available in naturally aspirated form as well, as the Dangan Si and Dangan Ri. In May 1991 an automatic option was added to the Dangan ZZ. The Kei car standards were altered for 1990, allowing for a increase in length and an increase in displacement to 660 cc. The Minica's engine was now 657 cc, while the front bumper gained and the rear bodywork was altered to grow by . The wheelbase remained unchanged, while a black plastic element was added behind the rear windows to fill the extra space. Chassis codes changed to H26 and H27. A tall three-door MPV model with optional four-wheel drive, the Minica Toppo, was also introduced in February 1990 - the Toppo, being developed before the new regulations were finalized, did not take full advantage of them and ended up shorter than other kei cars. The Dangan Turbo only received its increase in displacement and increase in length in August 1990, six months after the rest of the range had been updated. In January 1992 the range received a light facelift, along with some new models. New were the Piace and Milano sedans, celebrating the thirtieth anniversary of the Minica, and the Dangan ZZ-Limited which has standard ABS brakes. In January 1993, shortly before the line was replaced, the Milano Limited and Milano four-wheel-drive were added. Export versions were still usually carrying the \\"Towny\\" label and featured an 800 cc engine.

The five-valve-per-cylinder three-cylinder engines were replaced with a pair of 659 cc four-cylinder engines; one normally aspirated with single overhead cam and four valves per cylinder, and one turbocharged with double overhead cam and five valves per cylinder. A version of the Toppo with two doors on the passenger side, similar to the \\"Lettuce\\", was made available, along with a limited edition RV version. In January, 1997 versions of the Minica and Toppo with retro-styled front ends were introduced as the \\"Town Bee\\" model. Mitsubishi Minica Town Bee Eighth generation The enlarged eighth- generation Minica was introduced in October, 1998 to take advantage of the new regulations, as a pair of three-door and five-door sedans with torsion beam rear suspension and optional four-wheel drive, with the only available engine the 657 cc three-cylinder single overhead cam unit, now equipped with four valves per cylinder. This version is at the maximum exterior dimensions and engine displacement limits as defined in Japanese government regulations for cars classified as kei cars. A five-door MPV built on this platform but with a four-cylinder double overhead cam five-valve-per-cylinder turbocharged engine, known as the \\"Mitsubishi Toppo BJ\\" was also introduced. Front-wheel-drive models carry the H42 chassis code, four-wheel-drives are H47. This is followed by an \\"A\\" for passenger models and a \\"V\\" for commercials. In January, 1999 the retrostyled Town Bee version of this generation of Minica and the \\"Mitsubishi Toppo BJ Wide\\" were introduced. In October, 1999 a 659 cc four-cylinder single overhead cam four-valve-per-cylinder turbocharged engine was introduced, and in December, 1999 a limited edition of 50 \\"Mitsubishi Pistachios\\" with a 1094 cc double overhead cam four-valve-per-cylinder direct-injection engine was made available only to organizations working to protect the environment. In October, 2001 a five-door wagon version of the Minica was introduced as the Mitsubishi eK Wagon, and now serves as Mitsubishi's primary product in the \\"kei\\" class. Passenger versions were discontinued in 2007, while the models intended for commercial use continued to be built until 2011. The Mitsubishi eK is a kei-car which is the successor of the Minica.

Free newspapers are distributed free of charge, often in central places in cities and towns, on public transport, with other newspapers, or separately door-to-door. The revenues of such newspapers are based on advertising. They are published at different levels of frequencies, such as daily, weekly or monthly. Origins =Outside the U.S.= Germany In 1885 the General-Anzeiger f√ºr L√ºbeck und Umgebung (Germany) was launched. The paper was founded in 1882 by Charles Coleman (1852‚Äì1936) as a free twice-a-week advertising paper in the Northern German town of L√ºbeck. In 1885 the paper went daily. From the beginning the General-Anzeiger f√ºr L√ºbeck had a mixed model, for 60 pfennig it was home delivered for three months. Unknown, however, is when the free distribution ended. The company website states that the ‚Äôsold‚Äô circulation in 1887 was 5,000; in 1890 total circulation was 12,800. Australia In 1906 the Australian Manly Daily was launched. It was distributed on the ferry boats to Sydney and is now published as a free community daily by Rupert Murdoch's News Ltd. United Kingdom In 1984 the Birmingham Daily News was launched in Birmingham, England. It was distributed free of charge on weekdays to 300,000 households in the West Midlands and was the first free daily in Europe.History of British Newspapers The Newspaper SocietyBirmingham reunion planned Holdthefrontpage It was profitable until the early 1990s recession, when it was converted into a weekly title by its then owners Reed Elsevier. By 1992, a number of former paid-for local newspapers in the United Kingdom, such as the Walsall Observer, were being closed down and converted to free newspapers (sometimes called \\"freesheets\\").Denver, D.T. & Hands, Gordon. Modern constituency electioneering: local campaigning in the 1992 general election. Routledge, 1997; p. 169 Distribution of Metro in the Montreal Metro, Canada In 1995, the same year the Palo Alto Daily News began, Metro started what may be the first free daily newspaper distributed through public transport in Stockholm, Sweden. Later, Metro launched free papers in many European and other countries. In the UK, the Daily Mail and General Trust group launched its own edition of Metro) in London in 1999, beating Metro International to the London market. The paper now has 13 editions across the country and a combined readership of 1.7 million. In October 2009 the Evening Standard became a free newspaper, becoming the first free quality press publication and doubling its circulation. =In the U.S.= Free newspapers in the United States trace their history back to the 1940s when Walnut Creek, California publisher Dean Lesher began what is widely believed to be the first free daily, now known as the Contra Costa Times. In the 1960s, he converted that newspaper and three others in the county to paid circulation. In the early 1970s, in Boulder, Colorado, regents at the University of Colorado kicked the student-run Colorado Daily off campus because of editorials against the Vietnam War. Regents hoped the paper would die; instead it began to focus on the community as a free tabloid published five days a week. In the following decades, a number of free dailies opened in Colorado, mostly started by University of Colorado graduates. Free dailies opened in Aspen (1979, 1988), Vail (1981), Breckenridge (1990), Glenwood Springs (1990); Grand Junction (1995); Steamboat Springs (1990); and Telluride (1991). In 1995, the founders of free dailies in Aspen and Vail teamed up to start the Palo Alto Daily News in Palo Alto, California, a city about 20 miles south of San Francisco. The Palo Alto paper was profitable within nine months of its launch and usually carries more than 100 retail (nonclassified) ads per day. The \\"Palo Alto Daily News model\\" has been copied a number of times over the years, including by four San Francisco Bay Area publications -- the San Francisco Examiner, the San Mateo Daily Journal, the Berkeley Daily Planet (which opened in 1999 and folded in 2001 and was reopened as a twice-a-week paper by new owners in 2004) and the Contra Costa Examiner (which opened and closed in 2004). The publishers of the Palo Alto Daily News (Aspen Times Daily founding editor Dave Price, and Vail Daily founder Jim Pavelich) have since launched successful free dailies in San Mateo, California (2000), Redwood City, California (2000), Burlingame, California (2000), Los Gatos, California (2002), Denver, Colorado (2002), and Berkeley, California (2006). Each goes by the \\"Daily News\\" name with the city's name in front, such as Denver Daily News. Under the Palo Alto Daily News model, papers are delivered to public places such as coffee shops, restaurants, stores, gyms, schools, corporate campuses, and news racks. Price and Pavelich have avoided putting the content of their newspapers online because that would reduce readership of their printed newspapers, and therefore reduce the effectiveness of their print advertising. While ads can be placed on Web pages, they are not as effective for clients as print advertising. They have said that if they ever find an example of a newspaper that is making a profit on its website, they would copy that approach.  Free dailies today  In less than 10 years these papers were introduced in almost every European country and in several markets in the United States, Canada, South America, Australia, and Asia. There are, as of 2008, free newspapers in at least 58 countries. Market leader Metro distributes seven million copies daily, while other companies publish 14 million copies. These 22 million copies are read by at least 45 million people daily. Worldwide, there are now over 44 million free newspaper editions being distributed on an average day, up from 24 million in 2005. Europe has the vast majority of daily free papers at 28.5 million, with the Americas at 6.8 million and Asia/Pacific/Africa regions at 8.6 million.  Entrepreneurs  Since 2000, many free dailies have been introduced including three in Hong Kong and three in Vancouver, B.C. Besides Metro, another successful publisher is Norway's Schibsted. In Switzerland, Spain and France it publishes 20 minutes, the name indicating the time people need to read it. Schibsted also had some disappointments. A German version had to be taken from the market after a bitter newspaper war with local publishers in Cologne, while an Italian edition never saw the streets because of legal matters (non-EU companies could not control Italian media firms, but this did not prevent the Italian market from becoming flooded with free newspapers). The Schibsted editions have a total circulation of 1.7 million. In March 2006 former Palo Alto Daily News managing editor Jeramy Gordon launched the Santa Barbara Daily Sound in Santa Barbara, California. Less than two months later, Dave Price (journalist) and Jim Pavelich launched the San Francisco Daily, which in 2008 morphed into the Palo Alto Daily Post, moving offices from San Francisco to Palo Alto.  Legal battles  In almost every European market where free newspapers were introduced there have been lawsuits on every possible ground, from unfair competition to littering, from the right on the name Metro to quarrels over the right to be distributed through public transport. This kind of distribution is by no means the only way free papers are distributed: racks in busy places like shopping centers, universities, restaurants (McDonald's), and hospitals, and delivery by hand on the street, outside railway stations, or door-to-door delivery are also used. In the United States, the owners of The Philadelphia Inquirer, Philadelphia Daily News and The New York Times sued the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority over an exclusive deal it made with Metro to distribute its papers on the agency's commuter trains. Metro won the suit but is losing the newspaper war; the free daily has struggled to win advertisers.  Newspaper wars  The Cologne newspaper war and legal battles were not the only problems free papers encountered. In Paris, hawkers who distributed free papers were attacked, and papers were destroyed and burned. The most common newspaper war however is the clash between publishers or, to be more precise, between local publishers and entrepreneurs like in Cologne. In many cities publishers turned the market that has been quiet for decades into a battlefield. Local publishers are now responsible for almost half of the total circulation of free daily newspapers. They have a monopoly in Belgium, the UK, Singapore, Melbourne, Austria, Argentina and Iceland. However, in other markets (France, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Korea, Denmark, Finland, Italy, USA) local publishers have a substantial market share. In some French and Italian markets three titles are competing; in Seoul there were six titles in October 2004. There are 3 free daily papers in London.  Internet strategy  Price and Pavelich have an entirely different view of the Internet than other free daily publishers. While most free daily publishers post their stories and/or PDF pages online, the creators of the Palo Alto Daily News model have refused to put their content online. They argue that posting their stories online will reduce demand for their printed newspapers, which will also reduce the effectiveness of their print ads. They note that readers have dropped their subscriptions to paid newspapers because they can get the same stories online, yet those newspapers make far less money on their websites than they do on their print editions.  Tabloidization  The success of the new free daily newspaper has been imitated by other publishers. In some countries free weeklies or semiweeklies have been launched (Norway, France, Russia, Portugal, Poland). In Moscow the semiweekly (in October 2004 expanded to three times a week) is also called Metro. In the Netherlands there is a local free weekly published four times a week. Also it is very likely that the rapid tabloidization in Western Europe (UK, Ireland, Sweden, Belgium, the Netherlands) has something to do with the success of the free tabloids. In Germany there are now four so-called compact cheap newspapers. Competition and cannibalism Figures indicate that many readers of free newspapers are indeed \\"new\\" readers or read both paid and free papers. Research by Belgian, UK, and US free dailies indicate that half of their readers only read free dailies. There seems to be a negative effect on single copy sales, but the overall effect does not indicate a great deal of impact on paid dailies. Indeed, several publishers of established paid products (notably the Tribune Company in New York and Chicago, the Washington Post Company in Washington, D.C., and News Corporation in London) have launched free newspapers in their markets despite the obvious risk of \\"cannibalization\\" (stealing readers from their own paid products) to reach new readers.  Impact on the environment  Whilst the proliferation of freesheet newspapers continues to escalate, the impact on the environment has become a concern to some environmentalists. Over 44 million editions are being produced every day worldwide; it takes 12 established trees to make one tonne of newsprint, which is enough to print 14,000 editions of an average-size tabloid. That means a daily usage of newsprint of a little over 3,142 tonnes. Which, in turn, means the felling of 37,714 trees. On average around 70% of paper used by the newspaper industry is claimed to be recycled. So after recycled paper usage, over 11,314 trees are being felled daily to feed the freesheet print presses in over 58 countries. Also, whilst the increased use of recycled paper is welcomed by many, the extensive bleaching (especially use of chlorine) and other chemical processes to make reclaimed paper blank again for reuse are not lessening the concerns of environmentalists.  Voluntary schemes  With the continued success of the free newspaper model, newspaper publishers are coming under increasing pressure from local councils and public transport companies to contribute more to the cleanup costs. In London, South West Trains have partnered with Network Rail to provide nine recycling bins which have been installed at Waterloo station. The project will initially run as a three-month trial and will see newspaper recycling bins located on platforms one through to four and 15 through to 19. Approximately 75,000 issues of the Metro are handed out at South West Trains' stations every morning; this represents around 12 tonnes of paper. Once the trial is complete, the companies say that they will measure the success and consider extending the scheme on a permanent basis. London Underground have partnered with London's Metro free newspaper to place bins at Watford, West Ruislip, Stanmore, Cockfosters, Hainault and High Barnet tube stations. The bins will be in place from 6 October for a period of six months and will be emptied daily by London Underground cleaning contractors, MetroNet and Tube Lines. Westminster Council recently announced that 120 tonnes of free newspapers were collected in six months from the 70 extra recycling bins that were sponsored by Associated Newspapers and News International. This figure falls short of the councils 400 tonnes per annum target. During the six-month period the council also collected 465 tonnes of waste paper from its own 153 on-street recycling bins. The free newspapers publishers are responsible for producing approximately 100 tonnes of free newspapers every day.

Ay≈üe Leyla Gencer (, n√©e √áeyrekgil; 10 October 192810 May 2008) was a Turkish operatic soprano. Gencer was a notable bel canto soprano who spent most of her career in Italy, from the early 1950s through the mid-1980s, and had a repertoire encompassing more than seventy roles. She made very few commercial recordings; however, numerous bootleg recordings of her performances exist. She was particularly associated with the heroines of Donizetti.Bel Canto Society page with Interview and photos , belcantosociety.org; accessed 29 May 2015. Early life Leyla Gencer was born in Polonezk√∂y (near Istanbul) to a Turkish father and a Polish mother. Her father, Hasanzade ƒ∞brahim Bey (who took the surname √áeyrekgil under the Surname Law of 1934), was a wealthy businessman, whose family was from the city of Safranbolu. Her mother, Lexanda Angela Minakovska, was from a Roman Catholic family of the Lithuanian aristocracy (she later converted to Islam and chose the name Atiye after her husband's death.)Obituary, Telegraph.co.uk; accessed 29 May 2015. Gencer's father died when she was very young. She grew up in the √áubuklu neighbourhood of Istanbul, on the Anatolian side of the Bosphorus strait. In 1946, she married ƒ∞brahim Gencer, a banker related to the influential ƒ∞pek√ßi family., Guardian.co.uk; accessed 20 September 2017. Education and early career She began to study singing at the Istanbul Conservatory but dropped out to study privately in Ankara with her teacher the Italian soprano Giannina Arangi-Lombardi. After Arangi-Lombardi's death, Gencer continued her studies with the Italian baritone Apollo Granforte. She sang in the chorus of the Turkish State Theater until 1950, when she made her operatic debut in Ankara, as Santuzza in Cavalleria Rusticana. During the next few years, she became well known in Turkey and sang frequently at functions for the Turkish government. Career in Italy In 1953, Gencer made her Italian debut at the Teatro di San Carlo in Naples as Santuzza. She returned to Naples the following year for performances of Madama Butterfly and Eugene Onegin. In 1957, she made her debut at La Scala in Milan as Mme. Lidoine in the world premiere of Poulenc's Dialogues of the Carmelites. She went on to appear regularly at La Scala, performing nineteen roles between 1957 and 1983 including Leonora in La forza del destino, Elisabetta in Don Carlos, the title role in Aida, Lady Macbeth in Macbeth, the title role in Norma, Ottavia in L'incoronazione di Poppea and Alceste. At La Scala, she also appeared as the First Woman of Canterbury in the world premiere of Pizzetti's L'assassinio nella cattedrale in 1958. In 1960, she toured the USSR, singing concerts in Moscow and Baku. In 1962, she debuted at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden as Elisabetta di Valois in Don Carlos and Donna Anna in Don Giovanni. Her United States debut had been at the San Francisco Opera in 1956, as Francesca in Zandonai's Francesca da Rimini. She sang in other American opera houses as well, but never at the Metropolitan Opera, despite discussions about her being engaged to sing Tosca there, also in 1956. She sang Chopin's Polish songs in Paris with Nikita Magaloff, a Liszt-Bart√≥k concert at La Scala, and a concert involving 'operas about Turks' in the Venetian carnival at La Fenice, showing her innovative character as an opera singer. Her last appearance on the operatic stage was in 1985, with La Prova di un'opera seria at La Fenice. She continued to appear in concerts until 1992. She was still active as of 2007, and had recently been appointed by La Scala's music director Riccardo Muti to run its school for young artists. Throughout her career, Gencer was particularly well known for her Donizetti, including Belisario, Poliuto, Anna Bolena, Lucrezia Borgia, Maria Stuarda and Caterina Cornaro. Her most acclaimed and best-known performance, though, was the Roberto Devereux she sang in Naples in 1964. Aside from bel canto roles, her repertory included works by such composers as Prokofiev, Mozart and Puccini. She appeared in many rarely performed operas, including Smareglia's La Falena, Rossini's Elisabetta, regina d'Inghilterra, Spontini's Agnese di Hohenstaufen, Pacini's Saffo and Gluck's Alceste. Gencer rose to international stardom in a short time, singing under some of the greatest Italian maestros, such as Vittorio Gui, Tullio Serafin, Gianandrea Gavazzeni, and Riccardo Muti. She contributed to the 'Donizetti Renaissance' with her great performances of Donizetti's forgotten operas. Her repertoire consisted of 72 roles, including operas by Monteverdi, Gluck, Mozart, Cherubini, Spontini, Simon Mayr, Puccini, Prokofiev, Britten, Poulenc, Menotti, and Rocca, encompassing lyric, coloratura, and dramatic soprano roles. Starting in 1982, she dedicated herself to teaching young opera singers. She worked as didactic art director of As.Li.Co. of Milan between 1983‚Äì88, and was appointed by Maestro Riccardo Muti to run La Scala's School for Young Artists in 1997-1998. As artistic director of the academy for opera artists in Teatro alla Scala, she specialized in teaching operatic interpretation. In 1996, she appeared in Jan Schmidt-Garre's film Opera Fanatic. Death Gencer died on 10 May 2008, aged 79, in Milan. Following her funeral service in San Babila Church and subsequent cremation in Milan, her ashes were brought to Istanbul and scattered in the waters of the Bosphorus on May 16, by famous musician Fazƒ±l Say, according to her wish.Leyla Gencer: Operatic soprano idolised in Italy, independent.co.uk; accessed 29 May 2015.Turkish soprano Gencer, who performed at La Scala, dies, denverpost.com; accessed 29 May 2015.

Koningsbosch is located next to the German border, approximately 10 kilometres east of the town of Echt. The neighbourhood of Koningsbosch, which also includes the hamlets Echterbosch, Spaanshuisken, Aan Reijans and the surrounding countryside, covers an area of 0.27 km¬≤,Statistics Netherlands (CBS), Bevolkingskernen in Nederland 2001 cbs.nl . Statistics are for the continuous built-up area. has 1.711 inhabitants (as of 1 May 2005) and consists of some 700 houses. The village is slowly growing with the younger generation moving in and the recent construction of additional playgrounds and a community center. The main roads within the village are the Prinsenbaan and the Kerkstraat. History The name Koningsbosch, \\"King's Forest\\", dates back from the time of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. Charles V had some possessions in the region, including some forests, hence the name Koningsbosch. In those days the forests were guarded by a Spanish forest keeper. The house he lived in was called Spaanshuisken, \\"Spanish House\\". The hamlet Spaanshuisken evolved around this house. The parish of Koningsbosch was founded in 1861. The first priest was Petrus Antonius Kelleners. The first church was built in 1863, designed by the famous Dutch architect Pierre Cuypers. However, this church soon proved to be too small. Therefore, a new church was built by Cuypers' former employee Jan Stuyt in 1926. This church still exists today. In 1873 a nunnery was built, which was abandoned in 1995. At the moment the nunnery, which has monumental status, is empty. Until today the church and the nunnery dominate the skyline of Koningsbosch. Patron Saint of the parish of Koningsbosch is Saint Godehard. Corporate life The village of Koningsbosch has a thriving corporate life. In 1992 the local shooting club (Schutterij St. Joseph) won the OLS. The local mixed choir Mes Amis became provincial champion in 1992 and 1993 and the local wood-wind and brass band (Harmonie St. Cecilia) became national champion in 1997. Successes of the local male choir \\"Koninklijk erkend mannenkoor St. Caecilia\\" are from earlier days. Periodically events are organised where various local associations perform together. In sept 2006 Mes Amis, the male choir and Harmonie St. Cecilia celebrated the 85th anniversary of the Harmonie in the B√ºrger-Treff in Waldfeucht, Germany. Every second week of December Mes Amis, the male choir, Harmonie St. Cecilia and the local church choir St. Caecilia perform together in a Christmas concert. References * E.

A leader of the clandestine Narodnaya Volya (People's Will) group, which advocated the use of terror to achieve a revolutionary overthrow of the government, Figner was a participant in planning the successful assassination of Alexander II in 1881. Figner was later arrested and spent 20 months in solitary confinement prior to trial, at which she was sentenced to death. The sentence was subsequently commuted and Figner was imprisoned in the Shlisselburg Fortress for 20 years before being sent into internal exile. Figner gained international fame in large part because of the widely translated memoir of her experiences. She was treated as a heroic icon of revolutionary sacrifice after the February Revolution in 1917 and was a popular public speaker during that year. Figner later became prominent in the Society of Former Political Prisoners and Exiles in the Soviet Union until its dissolution in 1935. Figner managed to survive the Great Terror of 1937 and died of natural causes in Moscow in 1942 at the age of 89. Biography =Early years= Vera Figner was born July 7 (June 25 O.S.), 1852, the oldest of six children of Nikolai Alexandrovich Figner and his wife, the former Ekaterina Khristoforovna Kuprianova, both members of the hereditary Russian nobility.Lynne Ann Hartnett, The Defiant Life of Vera Figner: Surviving the Russian Revolution. Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 2014; pg. 2. The family owned well over 1,000 acres of land, worked by serfs existing in a state of semi-slavery until the Emancipation of 1861. Her father served in the state forestry service, resigning that post to become a local administrative functionary called a \\"peace mediator\\" in the years after emancipation.Hartnett, The Defiant Life of Vera Figner, pg. 7. She was the sister of Lidija Figner and of the famous russian tenor Nikolai Figner. In 1863, at the age of eleven, Figner was sent to the Rodionovsky Institute for Noble Girls in the city of Kazan, which she attended for the next six years.Hartnett, The Defiant Life of Vera Figner, pg. 17. As one of only six cities in the Russian Empire to host a university, the provincial capital of Kazan was a city of culture and ideas and Figner gradually came to question and ultimately reject the passive and submissive gender role which the Radionovsky Institute attempted to inculcate into its pupils.Hartnett, The Defiant Life of Vera Figner, pp. 17-19. Despite the stifling intellectual regime at the cloistered institute, Figner expanded her intellectual horizons by surreptitiously reading prohibited books obtained during brief visits home.Hartnett, The Defiant Life of Vera Figner, pg. 19. She proved to be an excellent student, taking a particular interest in history and literature, and received the prize given to the top academic performer upon her graduation in 1869.Hartnett, The Defiant Life of Vera Figner, pg. 20. Figner desired to study medicine, which was not permitted in Russia following the closure to women of the St. Petersburg Medical-Surgical Academy from the early 1860s.Hartnett, The Defiant Life of Vera Figner, pg. 29. This meant leaving Russia to study abroad, and Vera Figner turned her eyes to the University of Zurich, which was accepting Russian women despite their lack of gimnazium diplomas. Figner's father forbade her from going, so she married Alexei Filippov, saved money and sold her dowry, and traveled to Zurich.Barbara A. Engel and Clifford N. Rosenthal (eds.), Five Sisters: Women Against the Tsar. Routledge, 1975; pg. ???. From 1872 to 1875, she was a student of Department of Medicine at the University of Zurich. In 1873, Figner joined the Fritsche circle, which was composed of thirteen young Russian radical women, some of whom would become important members of the All-Russian Social Revolutionary Organization. She had trouble reconciling her new political view of herself as a parasitic member of the gentry with her previous view of herself as a good, innocent, person. A directive banning all Russian women students from remaining in Zurich was published in the Government Herald, accusing them of using their medical knowledge to perform abortions on themselves, in 1873. =Revolutionary leader= Vera Figner as she appeared during the Revolution of 1905. Most of the Fritsche decided to return to Russia and spread socialist propaganda among the Russian peasantry, but Figner decided to remain in Switzerland to finish her studies. In 1875, Mark Natanson told her that the Fritsche desperately needed her help in Russia. She returned to Russia that year without getting her degree, but found herself unable to help the circle and so got a license as a paramedic and divorced her husband, where she became active with other revolutionary intellectuals in the Zemlya i Volya (Land and Liberty) organization. Figner took part in the Kazan demonstration in St. Petersburg in 1876. From 1877 through 1879, working as a doctor's assistant, she conducted revolutionary propaganda in the villages around Samara and Saratov. In the spring of 1879 the Zemlya i Volya organization was deeply divided over the question of terrorism, with one wing of the party advocating revolutionary propaganda in the villages and the other in favor of creating a revolutionary situation through the assassination of key figures in the Tsarist government and monarchy. In June of that year party activists gathered at the Voronezh Congress in a final effort to settle these differences.Derek Offord, The Russian Revolutionary Movement in the 1880s. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 1986; pg. 26. No permanent solution was reached and by the fall the Zemlya i Volya organization has split into two independently functioning groups: an anti-terror faction led by proto-Marxist Georgy Plekhanov called Cherny Peredel (Black Repartition), which included Pavel Akselrod, Lev Deich, Vera Zasulich, and others; and a pro-terror faction called Narodnaya Volya (People's Will). Vera Figner aligned herself with the latter, terrorist wing, becoming a member of the group's Executive Committee, which in a proclamation later in 1879 called for the execution of Tsar Alexander II for crimes committed against the people of the Russian Empire.Offord, The Russian Revolutionary Movement in the 1880s, pg. 28. The Narodnovoltsy (Narodnaya Volya members) established study circles of workers in St. Petersburg, Moscow, Odessa, Kiev, and Kharkov, and coordinated propaganda efforts among students at the country's universities. It also established printing presses for the production of leaflets and issued a magazine and a newspaper in an effort to build support for its revolutionary program. As a member of the Executive Committee, Figner also took part in the creation of the paramilitary wing of Narodnaya Volya and coordinated its activities. Figner participated in planning the assassination of the Tsar, including a failed attempt in 1880 in Odessa and a successful effort in March 1881 in St. Petersburg. The State secret police were relentless in tracking down members of the terrorist organization responsible for the killing of the Tsar and by the spring of 1882 only Vera Figner remained at large in Russia out of Narodnaya Volya's Executive Committee of 1879-80.Offord, The Russian Revolutionary Movement in the 1880s, pg. 51. This status made Figner the focal point and leader of the group's depleted forces. One assassination was carried out on her watch, the shooting of a member of the secret police in Odessa in March 1882. Figner's main activity as the de facto head of the Narodnaya Volya organization in 1882 related to the restoration of the underground apparatus, which was devastated by secret police arrests and seizures of equipment. The Narodnovoltsy managed to set up a new underground press in the period and conducted propaganda work among university students. Originally based in Odessa, Figner later moved to Kharkov, where she was ultimately betrayed by fellow Executive Committee member Sergey Degayev, who turned police informer in order to lessen his punishment after his December 20, 1882 arrest.Hartnett, The Defiant Life of Vera Figner, pg. 133. On February 10, 1883, Figner, characterized by police as \\"one of the most dangerous of the Central Committee of terrorists,\\" was herself arrested at her Kharkov apartment. The event moved new Tsar Alexander III to write in his diary, \\"She was finally caught.\\"S.S. Volk, Narodnaia Volia, 1879-1882. Moscow: Naukak, 1966; pg. 148. Cited in Hartnett, The Defiant Life of Vera Figner, pg. 133. The next chapter of Figner's life, that of a political prisoner, had begun. =Political prisoner= Following her arrest, Vera Figner spent the next 20 months before her trial in solitary confinement at the Peter and Paul Fortress. In 1884 Figner was sentenced to death, during the Trial of the Fourteen. This sentence was commuted through the intercession of Niko Nikoladze to perpetual penal servitude in Siberia. She was instead imprisoned for 20 years in the fortress at Schl√ºsselburg. In 1904, Figner was sent into internal exile to the Arkhangelsk guberniya, then Kazan guberniya, and finally Nizhny Novgorod. In 1906 she was allowed to go abroad, where she organized a campaign for political prisoners in Russia. She spoke in European cities, collected money, published a brochure on Russian prisons translated into many languages. In 1907 Figner joined the Socialist Revolutionary Party (PSR), but left the organization in 1909 after the Azef scandal. In 1915 she returned to Russia. =After the revolution= Vera Figner in 1930 as a leading figure of the Society of Former Political Prisoners and Exiles. After the October Revolution (she never accepted the way it had happened), Figner published her book –ó–∞–ø–µ—á–∞—Ç–ª—ë–Ω–Ω—ã–π —Ç—Ä—É–¥ (English title: Memoirs of a Revolutionist), which is still considered one of the best examples of the Russian memoir genre. The book made her famous worldwide and was translated into many languages. Figner was a prominent member of the Society of Former Political Prisoners and ExilesRussian: –û–±—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ –±—ã–≤—à–∏—Ö –ø–æ–ª–∏—Ç–∫–∞—Ç–æ—Ä–∂–∞–Ω –∏ —Å—Å—ã–ª—å–Ω–æ–ø–æ—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω—Ü–µ–≤. and played an active role with the society's official magazine, Katorga i ssylka (Hard Labor and Exile). Figner authored a number of biographies of several narodniks and articles on history of the Russian revolutionary movement from the 1870s-1880s. In 1932 Figner's collected works were published in the Soviet Union by the publishing house of the Society of the Former Political Prisoners and Exiles in seven volumes.Vera Figner, Polnoe sobranie sochinenii v semi tomakh.

Harper helped to establish both the University of Chicago and Bradley University and served as the first president of both institutions. Early life Harper was born on July 24, 1856, in New Concord, OhioThe original log cabin that was William Rainey Harper‚Äôs birthplace has been preserved and is located in New Concord, Ohio, across from the main gate of Muskingum College., to parents of Irish-Scottish ancestry. Very early in his life, Harper displayed skills years ahead of other children of his age, and he was labeled a child prodigy. By the age of eight, Harper began preparing for college-level courses. At the age of ten he enrolled in Muskingum College in his native New Concord, Ohio. At the age of fourteen, he graduated from Muskingum College. In 1872, Harper enrolled in Yale University to begin his postgraduate studies, and he completed these in 1876. Harper quickly assumed a series of faculty positions, including ones at Denison University and Yale University. Throughout his academic life, Harper wrote numerous textbooks. A strong supporter of lifelong learning, Harper was also involved with the Chautauqua Institution in Chautauqua, New York, and its academic programs starting in 1883. Personal life William Rainey Harper married Ella Paul Harper in 1875. They were the parents of three sons, Samuel Northrup, Paul, and Donald, and one daughter, Davida. Harper Library at the University of Chicago  As University of Chicago president  In 1891, John D. Rockefeller selected thirty-five-year-old Harper to assist in organizing the University of Chicago, and shortly thereafter, he was selected as the university's first president. Harper also had expert knowledge of every department of education as well as business acumen, and he was a very powerful public speaker. In hiring the faculty of the new university and selecting its students, Harper set standards quite high. Harper elevated the salaries of the faculty members above those of ordinary schoolteachers, and by doing so attracted the best scholars of all disciplines to the university. =Academic innovations= Harper founded the nation's first departments of Egyptology and sociology at Chicago and established the University of Chicago Press. He also instituted the nation's first extension school, enabling those who worked during the day to attend classes at night and on weekends. One of Harper's ideas, that many would benefit by taking the first two years of college in their hometowns, led to the founding of American community colleges. In the 1890s, Harper, fearful that the vast resources of the University of Chicago would injure smaller schools by drawing away good students, established an affiliation program with several regional colleges and universities, including Des Moines College, Kalamazoo College, Butler College, and Stetson University. Under the terms of the affiliation, the schools were required to have courses of study comparable to those at the University of Chicago; to notify the University early of any contemplated faculty appointments or dismissals; to make no faculty appointment without the University of Chicago's approval; and to send copies of examinations to the University for suggestions and improvements prior to distribution. The University of Chicago agreed to confer a degree on any graduating senior from an affiliated school who made a grade of A for all four years and on any other graduate who took twelve weeks additional study at the University of Chicago. A student or faculty member of an affiliated school was entitled to free tuition at the University of Chicago, and Chicago students were eligible to attend an affiliated school on the same terms and receive credit for their work. The University of Chicago also agreed to provide affiliated schools with books and scientific apparatus and supplies at cost; to provide special instructors and lecturers without cost except travel expenses; and to provide a copy of every book and journal published by the University of Chicago Press to the libraries of the affiliated schools at no cost. The agreement provided that either party could terminate the affiliation on proper notice. Several University of Chicago professors disliked the program, as it required uncompensated additional labor from them and cheapened Chicago's academic reputation. After Harper's death in 1906, the program was gradually discontinued, and it had passed into history by 1910.Gilbert Lycan, Stetson University: The First 100 Years, Chicago: Stetson University Press, 1983, 70-72, 168-188. =Religious education= With his background as a Semiticist and Baptist clergyman, Harper believed that the University's programs should include religious study. Accordingly, he arranged for the Baptist Theological Union Seminary to relocate from Morgan Park and become the University of Chicago Divinity School. In 1903 Harper founded the Religious Education Association. Other activities While at University of Chicago, Harper chaired a mayoral commission responsible for reorganizing Chicago Public Schools and standardizing the system's curriculum. Harper, being opposed to the employment of women as teachers (which had resulted from the reforms of Horace Mann), moved to block a raise for female teachers and encourage the selective hiring of men. The ensuing dispute contributed to the organizing of the Chicago Teachers Federation, the precursor to the Chicago Teachers Union. In 1896, Harper assisted Lydia Moss Bradley in founding Bradley Polytechnic Institute in Peoria, Illinois. Now known as Bradley University, Harper served as its first president. Death and legacy Harper died on January 10, 1906, of cancer at age 49. He and his wife are interred at Rockefeller Memorial Chapel on campus at the University of Chicago. William Rainey Harper College, a community college located in Palatine, Illinois, honors him. He is also the namesake of Harper High School and Harper Avenue in Chicago. An elementary school in Cleveland is named for him as well. Published works * Introductory Hebrew Method and Manual (1886) * An Inductive Greek Method (1888) (co-written by William E.

Twilight of Honor is a courtroom drama based on Al Dewlen's novel, with a screenplay by Henry Denker. Like the 1959 courtroom drama Anatomy of a Murder, it continued a recent trend of descriptions of things previously never mentioned in American cinema, such as vivid accounts of sexual assault, adultery, and prostitution. It was Chamberlain's first starring role in a feature. Plot David Mitchell (Richard Chamberlain), a widowed lawyer in a small city inn New Mexico, is appointed by Judge Tucker to defend Ben Brown (Nick Adams) who has been charged with murder. Norris Bixby, an ambitious local prosecutor, has been assigned to try the case, hoping to fill the shoes of Art Harper (Claude Rains), a famed local prosecutor as well as David's friend and mentor, who is retired. Mitchell goes to see Art Harper that night to ask for advice and receives a pep-talk from Harper, demanding he use every legal trick in the book to defend his new client. They are interrupted by Susan (Joan Blackman), Harper's daughter, who has romantic feelings for David and who has arrived back in town from Chicago. During dinner Mitchell says that Ben Brown confessed to the killing and that the prosecution is asking for the gas chamber. He knows that Brown is unlikely to get a fair trial in town, and even he confesses to having preconceived notions about him. Harper says he played a role in Mitchell's being appointed as the defense on the case, and that while he himself is not healthy enough to defend the case personally, he will help Mitchell try to obtain justice for the accused. Susan also volunteers to be his legal secretary, hoping to spend time with Mitchell. The next morning, Mitchell goes to the prison to see his new client. He runs into Ben's wife, Laura-Mae Brown (Joey Heatherton), who turned her husband in and who reveals that she despises her husband, and \\"hopes he croaks,\\" claiming Ben frequently beat her. She says he murdered a man in a bungled robbery attempt, then fled in the man's car. She also claims that her husband is a compulsive liar and that Mitchell didn't run into her by chance; Bixby wanted her to talk to him, to make it appear the trial will be fair. Despite what his wife said about him, Ben appears to be only concerned with his wife's freedom, claiming he wants her to have a good lawyer. Ben says that he was starved, threatened, and beaten into signing the confession. He also reveals that a second confession was sought and that parts of the first were purposely left off, including Ben's assertion that the murdered man, Cole Clinton, an off-duty police officer, was committing adultery with his wife before the murder. Mitchell and Harper research New Mexico law, and find a precedent which states that a murder that occurs during the adultery of a man's spouse is deemed justifiable homicide. Mitchell also reveals that the entire jury list is consisting of friends of Clinton, who was a popular man in town. Despite this, they feel that they finally have a solid defense for the case. After Harper goes to bed, Susan tells Mitchell she loves him. The next morning, Mitchell, Morris Bixby, and Judge Tucker arrive to pick the jury. Mitchell and Bixby argue over the fairness of the case, and when picking the jury, Judge Tucker refuses to disqualify Clinton's friends and club members. At lunch, David finds that a local paper is being sold outside the court in view of the jurors and that the front page story features Ben's confession. Mitchell learns that Bixby leaked the confession to the press, knowing that the jurors will read it. Back in court, a witness claims that Ben was abusive towards his wife in a bar and that he was eyeing Clinton's money. Another witness claims that Ben saw Clinton drop his money and that he clearly knew he had a large wad of bills on him. When Mitchell asserts that Clinton intended to spend the night with Laura-Mae, Mrs. Clinton faints. After the day in court, Mitchell visits Mrs. Clinton at her request. She reveals that Mitchell's suspicions are true and that for the last few years, her husband was chasing younger women. She offers to plea for mercy for Ben if David drops his adultery defense out of respect for Clinton's daughter, who idolized her father. Mitchell refuses her offer, hoping to help Ben avoid being found guilty altogether. Although an autopsy wasn't performed, Clinton's doctor alleges that he wasn't in the act of sexual intercourse during death. Bixby calls Clinton's widow to the stand despite Mitchell's objections. She says the accusations against her late husband are false, and although Mitchell could prove her wrong, he feels pity and refuses to cross-examine her. The next day. Ben's commanding officer from his time in the Air Force testifies Ben changed after being married, going AWOL repeatedly to see his wife, becoming moody, and showing signs of mental instability. After being denied leave to look for his wife, he attempted to hang himself as well. Mitchell then calls Ben to the stand. Ben tells how he first met his wife in a bar after seeing her dancing seductively at the jukebox. He was smitten by her and they danced and talked for hours. She accompanied him to his room, and despite just meeting her, Ben proposed marriage. She was arrested for prostitution, and after getting her out of jail, they began hitchhiking cross country where they met Mr. Clinton, who picked them up after seeing Laura-Mae. He showed his badge and gun, telling him not to worry about tickets. At a motel, Ben found Laura-Mae and Clinton together. He ran in as Clinton pulled his gun. In the struggle, Ben grabbed the gun and beat him to death with it. They fled in Clinton's car. Ben also tearfully admits he still loves his wife, and bears no ill will, even though she turned him in and applied for the reward money. Bixby begins his cross examination, asserting that Ben pimped his wife to Clinton, beating him to death when he refused. Bixby legally can't call Laura-Mae to the stand to testify against her husband, so he goads Mitchell into calling her, which he does. The judge dismisses the court before she can testify. David visits Laura-Mae to get her to agree to tell the truth and realizes she is about to have company. He waits around and sees a man enter her room. Looking through the window, he realizes it is Judson Elliot, Bixby's co-prosecutor, and that he is having an affair with her despite being married and having four kids. In court the next morning, Laura-Mae takes the stand. As Bixby begins his cross examination, David reveals in the judge's quarters that he saw them and that he will reveal the story if they cross-examine her. He also finds out that Elliot is carrying Clinton's money clip, which Laura-Mae gave to him. After dismissing Elliot, Bixby refuses to compromise, and as court resumes, Harper arrives and is wheeled into the courtroom by Mitchell. Mitchell begins his closing statement. He goes over all of the points of the trial as well as the conniving done by the state to protect Mr. Clinton's reputation and advance Bixby's career. Bixby's rebuttal emphasizes the confession and plays on the emotions of the jury, most of whom were friends with Clinton. He claims that they can't find Ben innocent without finding Clinton guilty. The jury retires to deliberate, and Harper jovially challenges Mitchell to declare his intentions for Susan. Ben is found not guilty on all counts. Bixby is outraged at the loss, knowing it will hurt his career and curtail his ambitions. Harper confesses that Mitchell's newfound fame will make him the target of anyone in the Southwest in serious trouble, and passes the mantle to him. Mitchell declares his intentions for Susan, and the film ends with them sharing a kiss in front of the courthouse, then walking home.

He serves as elected mayor of Vavoua. Club career Born in Oum√©, Kalou started playing for ASEC Mimosas in his home country, before moving to Dutch-based Feyenoord. He played in Rotterdam for six seasons as a first team regular. He mainly played as a winger, but also played as a striker when necessary. Meanwhile, his brother, Salomon, who came to visit him, impressed the Feyenoord staff and was signed as a youth player. When Bonaventure decided to leave Feyenoord and try his luck in another European competition, the Ligue 1, at AJ Auxerre, Salomon was sent to Feyenoord's partner Excelsior on loan, before taking over his brother's role. Bonaventure played two seasons at Auxerre, where he developed further as a striker and an attacking midfielder as opposed to a winger. However, he still managed to score a similar number of goals compared to previous seasons. It was in this period that he talked to his brother, who still played at Feyenoord, into acquiring Dutch citizenship, which eventually was rejected by Dutch Foreign Minister Rita Verdonk. In 2005‚Äì06, he was transferred to Auxerre's Ligue 1 rivals Paris Saint-Germain. Paris Saint- Germain started to become a relegation-threatened team and he soon signed for another French team, RC Lens. The future looked bright for them, but they were surprisingly relegated at the end of the season. Kalou returned to the Netherlands in 2008 with SC Heerenveen, with whom he won the Dutch Cup in 2009. Heerenveen beat FC Twente in the final, and Kalou scored a goal. In the end of 2009, he was on trial at Crystal Palace and Le Mans, but both trials were unsuccessful. In February 2011, Kalou announced his retirement from professional football. He joined French lower league amateur club Combs-la- Ville for the 2011‚Äì12 campaign. International career left Kalou played in the 1997 FIFA World Youth Championship, and was also in the squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup for the Ivory Coast. He scored the winning goal in their final match, against Serbia and Montenegro.Match report: Ivory Coast v Serbia & Montenegro ESPN Soccernet Personal life His younger brother, Salomon, also played for Feyenoord. In the build-up to the 2006 FIFA World Cup, there was speculation that the brothers could have become the first to play against each other in a World Cup match, as Salomon was attempting to gain fast-track Dutch citizenship. This did not happen and ultimately Salomon would also play for the Ivory Coast, though not until after the World Cup. In October 2018, Kalou has been elected mayor of Vavoua, a city located in central part of the country. He was elected during municipal elections, running as an independent candidate.

Peck's Brentwood Production also co-produced the film.p.239 Fishgall, Gary Gregory Peck: A Biography Simon and Schuster, 2002 The film is based on the 1961 novel by Leo Rosten. It was loosely based on the World War II experiences of Rosten's close friend Ralph Greenson, M.D., while Greenson was a captain in the Army Medical Corps supporting the U.S. Army Air Forces and stationed at Yuma Army Airfield in Yuma, Arizona. Greenson is well known for his work on \\"empathy\\" and was one of the first in his field to seriously associate posttraumatic stress disorder (years before that terminology was developed) with wartime experiences. He was a director of the Los Angeles Psychoanalytic Institute and was a practicing Freudian. Greenson is perhaps best known for his patients, who included Marilyn Monroe, Frank Sinatra, Tony Curtis and Vivien Leigh. Major filming took place at the U.S. Army's Fort Huachuca complex in southern Arizona, with the co-located Libby Army Airfield used to portray the fictional Colfax Army Air Field. The story was used as a 1972 television pilot of the same title produced by Danny Thomas Productions starring Jim Hutton in the title role and Joan Van Ark as Lt Corum.p.650 Terrace, Vincent Encyclopedia of Television Pilots, 1937‚Äì2012 McFarland, 26 Feb. 2013 Plot In 1944, Captain Josiah Newman is head of the neuro-psychiatric Ward 7 at the Colfax Army Air Field (AAF) military hospital, located in the Arizona desert. As he explains to a visiting VIP who wanders in: \\"We're short of beds, doctors, orderlies, nurses, everything ... except patients.\\" He will use unconventional tactics to treat his patients and to recruit much needed personnel, as when he hijacks a new and very reluctant orderly, Corporal Jackson Leibowitz, a wheeler-dealer from New Jersey. Leibowitz promptly has the entire ward participating in a sing-along of \\"Old MacDonald Had a Farm.\\" Newman also takes great pains to court nurse Lieutenant Francie Corum on what she thinks is a date... until he asks her to transfer to Ward 7. Their 'date/fight' is cut short by a phone call: Colonel Bliss has forced his way into Ward 7 looking for Dr. Newman with a 6-inch knife, because Newman blocked his return to active duty after witnessing Bliss' erratic behavior. After watching Newman's handling of this situation and other patients on the ward, Corum transfers in. Newman treats shell-shocked, schizophrenic and catatonic patients, facing an especial challenge from the traumatized Corporal Jim Tompkins, an Eighth Air Force air gunner whose mind has been shattered by his war experiences. He is bedeviled by Colfax AAF's \\"old-school\\" base commander, Colonel Pyser, who ultimately saddles him with a complement of injured Italian POWs because his is the only secure ward in the hospital. In addition, a flock of constantly straying sheep (kept for the medical lab) that find their way to the airfield and a set of feuding orderlies keeps life interesting right up to Christmas 1944.

Early and family life Marshall was educated at University College School, an independent school for boys in Hampstead, a suburb of North London. He left at the age of 16, and did not attend university or any other higher education institution. In 1958 he married Janet Cracknell (later Lady Marshall) a fellow officer on the Orient Steam liner, the Ostrava. They had one child, Joanna, born 1960. Business career His extensive experience in international business started in shipping in 1951 with Orient Steam Navigation Company, thereafter in vehicle rental and leasing for 23 years, initially with Hertz and then Avis, during which time he lived and worked in the United States, Canada, Mexico and the United Kingdom. In 1971 he was appointed Executive Vice President of Avis where he became President and Chief Executive in 1976, based in New York City. Following the take-over of Avis, in 1979 he was appointed Executive Vice President of Norton Simon Inc., and Co-Chairman of Avis. Marshall was hired by Lord King of Wartnaby in 1983 as CEO of British Airways (BA) and was instrumental in the reform of the company prior to its successful privatisation in 1987. During the late 1980s and early 1990s BA was witnessing the emergence of a menacing rival, Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic. Virgin, which began with one route and one Boeing 747 in 1984, was beginning to emerge as a serious threat on some of BA's most lucrative routes. Following a highly publicised mercy mission to Iraq to fly home hostages of Saddam Hussein in 1991, King is reported to have told Marshall and his PR Director David Burnside to \\"do something about Branson\\"¬π. This began the campaign of \\"dirty tricks\\", which ended in Branson suing King and BA for libel in 1992. King countersued Branson and the case went to trial in 1993. The court found in favour of Branson and Virgin, and ordered King and BA to pay damages to Branson of ¬£500,000 and a further ¬£110,000 to his airline, and legal fees of up to ¬£3 million. In the aftermath of the case King was appointed President while Marshall was promoted to chairman, a role he combined with that of CEO. Bob Ayling became managing director. In 1996 Ayling became sole CEO, and his tenure was to be one of the most turbulent in BA's history. In 1997 he dropped the Union Flag design from BA's livery in favour of the unpopular ethnic art livery. In 1999 BA reported a 50% slump in profits, its worst since privatisation. In March 2000 Marshall removed Ayling from his position and in May announced Rod Eddington as his successor. While helping to promote the government's Action 2000 campaign, which encouraged businesses to ensure that their computers recognised, interpreted and processed the year 2000 date change, he was criticised for the contents of BA's own 1999 holiday brochures. These warned travellers: 'We will not cover claims arising from equipment or any computer program failing to recognise, interpret or process any date changes for example the year 2000.' Marshall retired from the role of Chairman of BA in July 2004 and was succeeded by Martin Broughton, former Chairman of British American Tobacco. From May 1996 to July 1998, Marshall was President of the Confederation of British Industry and chaired the CBI International Advisory Board. He was chairman of the board of Governors of Birkbeck, University of London, Vice-President of the Advertising Association; Member of the British American Business Council International Advisory Board; a Council Member of the Institute of Directors; and President of the Commonwealth Youth Exchange Council. From June 1998 to July 2003, Marshall was also Chairman of Invensys plc and was Chairman of from 1995 to 2000. He was Chairman of The Royal Institute of International Affairs (Chatham House) from September 1999 to July 2003; Chairman of The Board of Trustees of The Conference Board Inc., from October 2000 to October 2003; member of the Board of HSBC Holdings plc from January 1993 to May 2004 and Chairman of the Queen's Club from 2007 to 2010. He was appointed Chairman of Pirelli UK plc in September 2003 and Chairman of Nomura Securities on 1 October 2004. From 1 January 2005 to 1 January 2007, Lord Marshall was also Chairman of the National British Tourist Board, VisitBritain. In 1991, Marshall was the recipient of the Tony Jannus Award for his contributions to commercial aviation. Announced in the 1998 Birthday Honours he was created a life peer as Baron Marshall of Knightsbridge, of Knightsbridge in the City of Westminster on 20 July 1998. In 1989, he was awarded an Honorary Degree (Doctor of Laws) by the University of Bath. After his death, Birkbeck College set up a memorial lecture in his name.

The character works for the Office of National Emergency. She is most notable for her work as the liaison for mutant affairs in the United States government. She once claimed to have been inspired to government service by the interesting cases her brother, an FBI agent, encountered in his work (it was implied, but never stated outright, that her brother is Dale Cooper from Twin PeaksX-Factor vol. 1 #71). Publication history Valerie Cooper was created by Chris Claremont and John Romita Jr., and first appeared in Uncanny X-Men #176 (December 1983). Dr. Valerie Cooper received an entry in the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update '89 #2. She appeared sporadically as a secondary character, often an antagonist, in various Marvel series through the 1980s, primarily Uncanny X-Men (written by Claremont) and Captain America (written by Mark Gruenwald). When writer Peter David and artist Larry Stroman took over X-Factor in 1991, they added Cooper as a major character, and she was featured in the majority of the series until its cancellation in 1998. The character reached additional prominence in the mid-2000s, appearing in dozens of issues in 2006 at the height of Marvel's \\"Decimation\\" and \\"Civil War\\" events. Also in 2006, Peter David returned to write a relaunched X-Factor and eventually featured her in the series during the period 2007-2009. In the 2010s she made few appearances. Fictional character biography Dr. Valerie Cooper was originally a special National Security Advisor on national security issues, which include metahuman affairs. Originally, Valerie Cooper took a hard-line concern on the problem of the threat that superhumans and mutants posed to the United States. =Freedom Force= This position changed slightly when Valerie Cooper oversaw Mystique's team, the former Brotherhood of Mutants, which operated as government agents under the new name of Freedom Force. Around this time Cooper was also involved in a project to create government sponsored superheroes which resulted in the creation of the second version of Spider- Woman (Julia Carpenter) as well as three villains that would become her enemies Deathweb. Carpenter would subsequently be assigned by Cooper to join Freedom Force. Meanwhile, Valerie Cooper and the Commission were directly involved in the events of the government demanding the identity of Captain America under the argument that he was their property. With Steve Rogers giving up the identity of Captain America, Cooper supervised the recruitment of John Walker and Battlestar. The two of them became the new Captain America and the new Bucky, respectively. Valerie Cooper's next duty was to hire Forge, to create a machine to detect mutant powers. The Freedom Force project was shut down when several members were killed while others were missing after being abandoned in Kuwait. During the Muir Island Saga, Cooper's mind fell under the control of the Shadow King. Valerie was ordered by the Shadow King to shoot Mystique but fought the command and ended up turning the gun on herself. Val was critically injured, but survived. Mystique, with the aid of Nick Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D. hypnotists, went undercover as Val in an attempt to foil the Shadow King. It wasn't until the defeat of the Shadow King, by the X-Men and X-Factor, that Mystique and Cooper were able to return to their own lives. =X-Factor= After witnessing first-hand the deeds of mutants throughout the years, Valerie Cooper wanted to give the concept of a government sponsored team another shot. She was able to convince several members of the X-Men and their associates to form a new X-Factor team. This new team, composed of Havok, Polaris, Wolfsbane, Multiple Man, Quicksilver, and Strong Guy replaced Freedom Force, with Val acting as government liaison to the team. Val is assisted by the human employee Baldrick.X-Factor Annual #7 (1992) Soon after Val was once again mentally controlled, this time by the Acolytes. Val was freed from the Acolytes' control, but her relationship with X-Factor was damaged when it was revealed that she knew of Project Wideawake, a new Sentinel project being developed by the U.S. Government. Cooper later decided to hand leadership of the team directly to Forge. With the world getting more dangerous around her and the departure of some of the members, Cooper was forced by the government to allow Mystique and Sabretooth to join. With Forge in command, the team went underground. =Commission on Superhuman Affairs= Cooper returned to the Commission on Superhuman Affairs. In her position, she found herself helping the X-Men out on several occasions. She was later responsible for taking Charles Xavier away to a government facility following the Onslaught incident. Valerie was instrumental in helping the old Thunderbolts defeat Henry Peter Gyrich and negotiated for the team their Presidential Pardon. =O*N*E= Cooper helps establish the Office of National Emergency (or O*N*E), an official government branch dedicated to preparation and defense against superhuman threats; not much later, she becomes its Deputy Director. The O*N*E, with its first line of defense being the Sentinel Squad O*N*E, becomes responsible for the mutant refugee camp established at the X-Mansion after most of the world's mutants are depowered during the Decimation event. Many mutants join the camp willingly while some are secretly coerced into it. With the destruction of the X-Mansion and the X-Men's subsequent move to San Francisco, O*N*E no longer watches over the X-Men's day-to-day activities nor does it guard them with Sentinels.

According to the documentary hypothesis, the Elohist (or simply E) is one of four source documents underlying the Torah,McDermott, John J., Reading the Pentateuch: A Historical Introduction (Pauline Press, 2002) p. 21. Via Books.google.com.au. October 2002. . Retrieved 2010-10-03. together with the Jahwist (or Yahwist), the Deuteronomist and the Priestly source. The Elohist is so named because of its pervasive use of the word Elohim to refer to the Israelite god. The Elohist source is characterized by, among other things, an abstract view of God, using Horeb instead of Sinai for the mountain where Moses received the laws of Israel and the use of the phrase \\"fear of God\\". It habitually locates ancestral stories in the north, especially Ephraim, and the documentary hypothesis holds that it must have been composed in that region, possibly in the second half of the 9th century BCE. Because of its highly fragmentary nature, most scholars now reject the existence of the Elohist source as a coherent independent document. Instead, the E material is viewed as consisting of various fragments of earlier narratives that are incorporated into the Jahwist document.  Background  Modern scholars agree that separate sources and multiple authors underlie the Pentateuch, but there is much disagreement on how these sources were used to write the first five books of the Bible. This documentary hypothesis dominated much of the 20th century, but the 20th- century consensus surrounding this hypothesis has now broken down. Those who uphold it now tend to do so in a highly modified form, giving a much larger role to the redactors (editors), who are now seen as adding much material of their own rather than as simply passive combiners of documents. Among those who reject the documentary approach altogether, the most significant revisions have been to combine E with J as a single source, and to see the Priestly source as a series of editorial revisions to that text. The alternatives to the documentary approach can be broadly divided between \\"fragmentary\\" and \\"supplementary\\" theories. Fragmentary hypotheses, seen notably in the work of Rolf Rendtorff and Erhard Blum, see the Pentateuch as growing through the gradual accretion of material into larger and larger blocks before being joined together, first by a Deuteronomic writer,\\"Deuteronomic\\" means related to the Book of Deuteronomy, which was composed in the late 7th century BCE. and then by a Priestly writer (6th/5th century), who also added his own material. The \\"supplementary\\" approach is exemplified in the work of John Van Seters, who places the composition of J (which he, unlike the \\"fragmentists\\", sees as a complete document) in the 6th century as an introduction to the Deuteronomistic history (the history of Israel that takes up the series of books from Joshua to Kings). The Priestly writers later added their supplements to this, and these expansions continued down to the end of the 4th century BCE.  Characteristics, date and scope  In the E source God's name is always presented as \\"Elohim\\" or \\"El\\" until the revelation of God's name to Moses, after which God is referred to as ◊ô◊î◊ï◊î, often represented in English as \\"YHWH\\". E is theorized to have been composed by collecting together the various stories and traditions concerning biblical Israel and its associated tribes (Dan, Napthali, Gad, Asher, Issachar, Zebulun, Ephraim, Manasseh, Benjamin), and the Levites, and weaving them into a single text. It has been argued that it reflects the views of northern refugees who came to Judah after the fall of Kingdom of Israel (Samaria) in 722 BCE. E has a particular fascination for traditions concerning the Kingdom of Israel and its heroes such as Joshua and Joseph. E favors Israel over the Kingdom of Judah (e.g., claiming that Shechem was purchased rather than massacred) and speaks negatively of Aaron (e.g., the story of the golden calf). In particular it records the importance of Ephraim, the tribe from which Jeroboam, the King of Israel, happened to derive. Some independent source texts thought to have been embedded within the text include the Covenant Code, a legal text used in the Chapters 21‚Äì23 of the Book of Exodus. As contrasted with the Jahwist =Abram and Isaac= The Elohist's story begins after Abram (Abraham) has begun migration, with the wife‚Äìsister narrative that is also present in the Jahwist tale. After that, the first major story about Abram is that of the sacrifice of Isaac. In the Elohist work, Isaac never appears again after the conclusion, and the story strongly implies that Isaac was truly sacrificed. The Jahwist, on the other hand, does not mention this tale of Isaac's sacrifice at all, although he does mention Isaac extensively. When the presumed redactor came to edit together their writings, Isaac's continued presence would thus need to be explained. The text attributed to the redactor presents an escape clause, the Lord's allowing Abram to sacrifice a ram in place of his son, allowing Isaac to live. But nevertheless, an early tradition recorded in a midrash still preserves a version of the tale in which Isaac was killed. Understandably, given the Elohist's narrative so far, the next tale the Elohist offers brings the chance for Abram to have other children. =Role of angels= While the Jahwist presented an anthropomorphic God who could walk through the Garden of Eden looking for Adam and Eve, the Elohist frequently involves angels. For example, it is the Elohist version of the tale of Jacob's ladder in which there is a ladder of angels with God at the top, leading to Jacob later dedicating the place as Beth-El (House of God), whereas in the Jahwist tale, it is a simple dream in which God is simply above the location, without the ladder or angels. Likewise, the Elohist describes Jacob actually wrestling with God; later, it features the tale of Balaam and his divinely talking donkey, although this is often considered a tale that was accidentally added to the manuscript, as it appears quite unconnected to the rest of the work. =Attitude toward the northern tribes= Further into the text, the Elohist exhibits a noticeably positive attitude to the main northern tribes‚Äîthose of Joseph. Unlike the Jahwist, the Elohist contains stories of the political position of the Joseph tribes: the birth of Benjamin, and the pre-eminence of Ephraim. Also, whereas the Jahwist portrays Joseph as the victim of an attempted rape in the tale of Potiphar's wife, which would have been mildly humiliating to the Joseph tribes, the Elohist instead portrays Joseph as an interpreter of dreams‚Äîas one who can understand God. This pre- occupation with northern concerns extends to the Elohist explaining the northern cultic object known as the Nehushtan. =Exodus from Egypt= With regard to the Exodus from Egypt, the Elohist presents a more elaborate tale than the Jahwist. Firstly, the Elohist version expands on the supposed cruelty of the Egyptians by presenting them as asking for difficult work such as bricks without straw. Secondly, whereas the Jahwist version of the Plagues of Egypt involves Moses acting only as an intercessor to ask God to stop each plague that God has wrought, the Elohist instead presents Moses as threatening the Pharaoh, and then bringing the plague down on the Egyptians himself. To the Elohist, the threat of the Angel of Death (recalled in the holiday of Passover) is enough to cause the Egyptians to chase the Israelites out, whereas the Jahwist presents the Egyptians as reluctantly giving in, and then changing their mind, and chasing after them to bring them back. =Ten Commandments and Covenant Code= Where the Jahwist simply presents its version of the Ten Commandments as the law given by God at Sinai, the Elohist instead presents the more extensive Covenant Code. The Elohist then goes on to deal with how such an extensive code can be used in practice, by using a relative of Moses, Jethro, as a mouthpiece to explain the reason for the appointment of judges. To enforce the code further, the Elohist describes the process of the law code being read out to the people.

The Jahwist is shown as J. thumbDiagram of the 20th century documentary hypothesis. The Jahwist, or Yahwist, often abbreviated J, is one of the most widely recognized sources of the Pentateuch (Torah), together with the Deuteronomist and the Priestly source. The existence of the Jahwist is somewhat controversial, with a number of scholars, especially in Europe, denying that it ever existed as a coherent independent document. Nevertheless, many scholars do assume its existence, and date its composition to the period of the Babylonian captivity (597-539 BCE) or perhaps somewhat later. The Jahwist is so named because of its characteristic use of the term Yahweh (German Jahwe, Hebrew ) for God. Background Modern scholars agree that separate sources underlie the Pentateuch, but there is much disagreement on how these sources were used by the authors to write the first five books of the Bible. The explanation called the documentary hypothesis dominated much of the 20th century, but the consensus surrounding this hypothesis has now broken down. Its critics suggest that contemporary upholders tend to give a much larger role to the redactors, who are now seen as adding much material of their own rather than as simply passive combiners of documents. The simple form of the documentary hypothesis has come under criticism from within its own constituents as well. The most notable revision in recent decades has been to suggest that the individual E and J documents are irrecoverable altogether, major parts of them having been scrapped by the first JE redactor; or that the E document was never independent at all, but rather is a part of the J document. Characteristics In J, Yahweh is an anthropomorphic figure both physically (, , ) and mentally (such as when Abraham bargains with Yahweh for the fate of Sodom and Gomorrah, or when, during the exodus, Yahweh, incensed by the Israelites' lack of faith, threatens to destroy them all and raise Moses' descendants instead but \\"relented and did not bring on his people the disaster he had threatened\\" when dissuaded by Moses). J has a particular fascination for traditions concerning Judah, including its relationship with its rival and neighbor, Edom; its focus on Judahite cities such as Jerusalem; and its support of the legitimacy of the Davidic monarchy. J is also critical of the other tribes of Israel, for example, by suggesting that the Northern Kingdom's capital of Shechem was captured via a massacre of the original inhabitants (). Michael D. Coogan suggests three recurring themes in the Jahwist tradition: the relationship between humans and soil, separation between humans and God, and progressive human corruption: =Relationship between humans and soil= J is unique in emphasizing a close relationship between humans and soil. This motif is first found in when \\"the first human is called Adam because he is taken from the soil [Adamah in Hebrew].\\" Initially, man lives in harmony with the soil. After man eats from the tree of the knowledge of good and bad, however, the relationship is marred. In Yahweh God curses the soil and man will toil in order to eat from it. Humans will return to the soil at death as described in . The motif is furthered in the story of Cain and Abel. Cain is a tiller of the soil (Adamah), and after the murder, Cain is cursed from the ground . The bond between man and the soil is, seemingly, restored with Noah. He is described as a man of the soil and is described as the one who will bring relief from the toil of agriculture . Noah's drunkenness also alludes to the link between humans and the soil or plant/food the soil produces and corruption. In the end, J repeatedly shows a connection between human corruption and the soil. =The separation between the divine and human= One of the recurring themes of J in Genesis is the boundary between the divine and human realms. In , by eating the forbidden fruit, man and woman become like gods and are banished from the Garden of Eden, preventing them from retaining their immortality and full divinity. This theme is also seen in in the sexual union of the sons of God with human women: Yahweh declares this a violation of the separation and limits the life span of their offspring. Lastly, this theme continues in in the story of the Tower of Babel in which Yahweh confuses mankind's language to prevent them from understanding each other and approaching divinity. =Progressive human corruption= A third theme in the Jahwist is the increase of human corruption. God creates a world that is \\"very good\\", one in which all creatures are vegetarian and violence is unknown, but Eve's disobedience is followed by Cain's murder of his brother Abel, until Yahweh sees that the whole Earth is filled with corruption and resolves to destroy it with the Flood. Corruption does not cease after the Flood, but God accepts that his creation is flawed. Date Julius Wellhausen, the 19th century German scholar responsible for the classical form of the documentary hypothesis, did not attempt to date J more precisely than the monarchical period of Israel's history. In 1938, Gerhard von Rad placed J at the court of Solomon, c. 950 BCE, and argued that his purpose in writing was to provide a theological justification for the unified state created by Solomon's father, David. This was generally accepted until a crucial 1976 study by H. H. Schmid, Der sogenannte Jahwist (\\"The So-called Yahwist\\"), argued that J knew the prophetic books of the 8th and 7th centuries BCE, while the prophets did not know the traditions of the Torah, meaning J could not be earlier than the 7th century. A number of current theories place J even later, in the exilic and/or post- exilic period (6th‚Äì5th centuries BCE). Scope The following is a record of the stories in the Bible that are generally accepted by the wider academic community as having been written by J: =Genesis= The Jahwist begins with the creation story at (the creation story at Genesis 1 is from P), this is followed by the Garden of Eden story, Cain and Abel, Cain's descendants, the Nephilim, a flood story (tightly intertwined with a parallel account from P), Noah's descendants, the incest incident in Noahs tent from Genesis 6, the Table of Nations and the Tower of Babel. These chapters make up the so-called Primeval History, the story of mankind prior to Abraham, and J and P provide roughly equal amounts of material. The Jahwist provides the bulk of the remainder of Genesis, the material concerning Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Joseph. Those following the classical documentary hypothesis today describe the J text spanning Genesis 2:4 to Genesis 35 with the end of the renaming of Jacob as Israel and the completion of the patriarchs of the twelve tribes. The Joseph narrative seems to be an addition from a northern \\"E\\" narrative due to the more ethereal, pro-active, and prophetic nature of God compared to the reactive and anthropomorphic God of the J text. The latest additions of the P text frame the J narratives. P text \\"glue\\" can be perceived in Genesis 1 (framing the book), Genesis 5 recounts Genesis 1 and provides a characteristic priestly lineage detail for Adam and, amongst other locations, Genesis 35, bridging the J text patriarchal narratives to the \\"E\\" Joseph narrative with more lineage details assumed important to post-exilic authors for the purpose of rebuilding the nation in the second temple period. =Exodus= Scholars argue regarding how much of Exodus is attributable to J and how much to E, as beginning in the E source also refers to God as Yahweh. J provides much of the material of but is closely intertwined with E. Thus, it is difficult to determine what portion of is J and what is E; however, it is easy to see the parallel P strand, which also gives an account of Israel's bondage and the Exodus miracles of its own. After leaving Egypt, J gives its own account of releasing water from a rock and God raining Manna upon the Israelites. Thereafter, there is almost no J material in Exodus, except J's account of the Ten Commandments, also known as the Ritual Decalogue. J is generally not focused on law. =Leviticus= The vast majority of scholars attribute almost the entirety of Leviticus to P. =Numbers= J begins with , the departure from Sinai, the story of the spies who are afraid of the giants in Canaan, and the refusal of the Israelites to enter the Promised Land‚Äîwhich then brings on the wrath of Yahweh, who condemns them to wander in the wilderness for the next forty years. J resumes at chapter 16, the story of the rebellion of Dathan and Abiram, which was spliced together with the account of Korah's rebellion from P by the Redactor. It is generally also believed that J provides large portions of chapters 21 to 24, covering the story of the bronze serpent, Balaam and his talking ass (although Friedman attributes this to E), and finally ending with the first verses of the Heresy of Baal Peor. = Deuteronomy = The majority of Deuteronomy was composed during the era of Josiah's reforms by the Deuteronomist, or D, writer. However, when Deuteronomy was incorporated into the completed Pentateuch by the Redactor, the events of Moses's death were moved from the end of Numbers to Deuteronomy. Thus, one of the accounts of Moses's death in Deuteronomy is attributable to J, although scholars debate which verses this includes.

The Priestly source is shown as P. The Priestly source (or simply P) is perhaps the most widely recognized source underlying the Torah. It is both stylistically and theologically distinct from other material in the Torah, and includes a set of claims that are contradicted by non-Priestly passages and therefore uniquely characteristic: no sacrifice before the institution is ordained by Yahweh (God) at Sinai, the exalted status of Aaron and the priesthood, and the use of the divine title El Shaddai before God reveals his name to Moses, to name a few. In general, the Priestly work is concerned with priestly matters ‚Äì ritual law, the origins of shrines and rituals, and genealogies ‚Äì all expressed in a formal, repetitive style. It stresses the rules and rituals of worship, and the crucial role of priests, expanding considerably on the role given to Aaron (all Levites are priests, but according to P only the descendants of Aaron were to be allowed to officiate in the inner sanctuary). P was written to show that even when all seemed lost, God remained present.Boadt, pp.103-104 Background The history of exilic and post-exilic Judah is little known, but a summary of current theories can be made as follows:Min, pp.63-65 *Religion in monarchic Judah centred around ritual sacrifice in the Temple. There, worship was in the hands of priests known as Zadokites (meaning that they traced their descent from an ancestor called Zadok, who, according to the Hebrew Bible, was the high priest appointed by Samuel.The Wiersbe Bible Commentary: Old Testament David C Cook pg 499) There was also a lower order of religious officials called Levites, who were not permitted to perform sacrifices and were restricted to menial functions. *While the Zadokites were the only priests in Jerusalem, there were other priests at other centres. One of the most important of these was a temple at Bethel, north of Jerusalem. Bethel, the centre of the \\"golden calf\\" cult, was one of the main religious centres of the northern kingdom of Israel and had royal support until Israel was destroyed by the Assyrians in 721 BCE. Aaron was in some way associated with Bethel. *In 587 BCE the Babylonians conquered Jerusalem and took most of the Zadokite priesthood into exile, leaving behind the Levites, who were too poor and marginalised to represent a threat to their interests. The temple at Bethel now assumed a major role in the religious life of the inhabitants of Judah, and the non-Zadokite priests, under the influence of the Aaronite priests of Bethel, began calling themselves \\"sons of Aaron\\" to distinguish themselves from the \\"sons of Zadok\\". *When the Zadokite priests returned from exile after c. 538 BCE and began re- establishing the temple in Jerusalem they came into conflict with the Levite priests. The Zadokites won the conflict but adopted the Aaronite name, whether as part of a compromise or in order to out-flank their opponents by co-opting their ancestor. *The Zadokites simultaneously found themselves in conflict with the Levites, who objected to their subordinate position. The priests also won this battle, writing into the Priestly document stories such as the rebellion of Korah, which paints the challenge to priestly prerogative as unholy and unforgivable. The Priestly work The Pentateuch or Torah (the Greek and Hebrew terms, respectively, for the Bible's books of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy) describe the prehistory of the Israelites from the creation of the world, through the earliest biblical patriarchs and their wanderings, to the Exodus from Egypt and the encounter with God in the wilderness. The books contain many inconsistencies, repetitions, different narrative styles, and different names for God.Gooder, pp.11-12 John Van Seters notes that \\"Turning to the Tetrateuch, we observe a feature that I have highlighted by the use of italics, in which parallel blocks of material have been set side by side. Thus, there are two accounts of creation, two genealogies of Seth, two genealogies of Shem, two covenants between Abraham and his god, two revelations to Jacob at Bethel, two calls of Moses to rescue his people, two sets of laws given at Sinai, two Tents of Meeting/Tabernacles set up at Sinai.\\" The repetitions, styles and names are not random, but follow identifiable patterns, and the study of these patterns led scholars to the conclusion that four separate sources lie behind them.Campbell&O;'Brien, ch.2 The 19th century scholars saw these sources as independent documents which had been carefully edited together, and for most of the 20th century this was the accepted consensus. But in 1973 the American biblical scholar Frank Moore Cross published an influential work called Canaanite Myth and Hebrew Epic, in which he argued that P was not an independent document (i.e., a written text telling a coherent story with a beginning, middle and end), but an editorial expansion of another of the four sources, the combined Jahwist/Elohist (called JE).Campbell&O;'Brien, pp.1-6 Cross's study was the beginning of a series of attacks on the documentary hypothesis, continued notably by the work of Hans Heinrich Schmid (The So- called Jahwist, 1976, questioning the date of the Jahwistic source), Martin Rose (1981, proposing that the Jahwist was composed as a prologue to the history which begins in Joshua), and Van Seters (Abraham in History and Tradition, proposing a 6th-century BCE date for the story of Abraham, and therefore for the Jahwist).Campbell&O;'Brien, pp.10-11 Even more radical was Rolf Rendtorff (The Problem of the Process of Transmission in the Pentateuch, 1989), who argued that neither the Jahwist nor the Elohist had ever existed as sources but instead represented collections of independent fragmentary stories, poems, etc.Campbell&O;'Brien, p.11 No new consensus has emerged to replace the documentary hypothesis, but since roughly the mid-1980s an influential theory has emerged which relates the emergence of the Pentateuch to the situation in Judah in the 5th century BCE under Persian imperial rule. The central institution in the post-Exilic Persian province of Yehud (the Persian name for the former kingdom of Judah) was the reconstructed Second Temple, which functioned both as the administrative centre for the province and as the means through which Yehud paid taxes to the central government. The central government was willing to grant autonomy to local communities throughout the empire, but it was first necessary for the would-be autonomous community to present the local laws for imperial authorisation. This provided a powerful incentive for the various groups that constituted the Jewish community in Yehud to come to an agreement. The major groups were the landed families who controlled the main sources of wealth, and the priestly families who controlled the Temple. Each group had its own history of origins that legitimated its prerogatives. The tradition of the landowners was based on the old Deuteronomistic tradition, which had existed since at least the 6th century BCE and had its roots even earlier; that of the priestly families was composed to \\"correct\\" and \\"complete\\" the landowners' composition.Ska, pp.217-218, 226 In the final document Genesis 1-11 lays the foundations, Genesis 12-50 defines the people of Israel, and the books of Moses define the community's laws and relationship to its God.Ska, p.231 Many scholars attribute the laws in the P source to the desire to glorify the Aaronide priestly caste responsible for their composition.Title = Revelation and Authority: Sinai in Jewish Scripture and Tradition Author = Benjamin D. Sommer Pub = The Anchor Yale Bible Reference Library Date = June 30, 2015 pg = 18 Characteristics, date and scope =Overview= The Priestly work is concerned with priestly matters ‚Äì ritual law, the origins of shrines and rituals, and genealogies ‚Äì all expressed in a formal, repetitive style.Viviano, p.41 It stresses the rules and rituals of worship, and the crucial role of priests,Gilbert, p.34 expanding considerably on the role given to Aaron (all Levites are priests, but according to P only the descendants of Aaron were to be allowed to officiate in the inner sanctuary).Kugler&Hartin;, pp.xix, 49 P's God is majestic, and transcendent, and all things happen because of his power and will. He reveals himself in stages, first as Elohim (a Hebrew word meaning simply \\"god\\", taken from the earlier Canaanite word meaning \\"the gods\\"), then to Abraham as El Shaddai (usually translated as \\"God Almighty\\"), and finally to Moses by his unique name, Yahweh.Bandstra, p.26 P divides history into four epochs from Creation to Moses by means of covenants between God and Noah, Abraham and Moses.McKenzie, p.46 The Israelites are God's chosen people, his relationship with them is governed by the covenants, and P's God is concerned that Israel should preserve its identity by avoiding intermarriage with non-Israelites. P is deeply concerned with \\"holiness\\", meaning the ritual purity of the people and the land: Israel is to be \\"a priestly kingdom and a holy nation\\" (Exodus 19:6), and P's elaborate rules and rituals are aimed at creating and preserving holiness.Brueggemann, pp.98-99 Good cases have been made for both exilic and post-exilic composition, leading to the conclusion that it has at least two layers, spanning a broad time period of 571‚Äì486 BCE.Min, pp.60-61 This was a period when the careful observance of ritual was one of the few means available which could preserve the identity of the people, and the narrative of the priestly authors created an essentially stable and secure world in which Israel's history was under God's control, so that even when Israel alienated itself from God, leading to the destruction of Jerusalem and the exile in Babylon, atonement could still be made through sacrifice and ritual. =Pentateuch= P is responsible for the first of the two creation stories in Genesis (Genesis 1), for Adam's genealogy, part of the Flood story, the Table of Nations, and the genealogy of Shem (i.e., Abraham's ancestry).Kugler&Hartin;, p.55 Most of the remainder of Genesis is from the Yahwist, but P provides the covenant with Abraham (chapter 17) and a few other stories concerning Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.Kugler&Hartin;, p.65 The book of Exodus is also divided between the Yahwist and P, and the usual understanding is that the Priestly writer(s) were adding to an already-existing Yahwist narrative.Kugler&Hartin;, p.75 Chapters 1‚Äì24 (from bondage in Egypt to God's appearances at Sinai) and chapters 32‚Äì34 (the golden calf incident) are from the Yahwist and P's additions are relatively minor, noting Israel's obedience to the command to be fruitful and the orderly nature of Israel even in Egypt.Kugler&Hartin;, p.78 P was responsible for chapters 25‚Äì31 and 35‚Äì40, the instructions for making the Tabernacle and the story of its fabrication.Kugler&Hartin;, pp.75-76 Leviticus 1‚Äì16 sees the world as divided between the profane (i.e., not holy) masses and the holy priests. Anyone who incurs impurity must be separated from the priests and the Temple until purity is restored through washing, sacrifice, and the passage of time.Kugel&Hartin;, p.83 Leviticus 17‚Äì26 is called the Holiness code, from its repeated insistence that Israel should be a holy people; scholars accept it as a discrete collection within the larger Priestly source, and have traced similar holiness writings elsewhere in the Pentateuch.Stackert, pp.12-16 In Numbers the Priestly source contributes chapters 1‚Äì10:28, 15‚Äì20, 25‚Äì31, and 33‚Äì36, including, among other things, two censuses, rulings on the position of Levites and priests (including the provision of special cities for the Levites), and the scope and protection of the Promised Land.Kugler&Hartin;, p.97 The Priestly themes in Numbers include the significance of the priesthood for the well-being of Israel (the ritual of the priests is needed to take away impurity), and God's provision of the priesthood as the means by which he expresses his faithfulness to the covenant with Israel.Kugler&Hartin;, p.98 The Priestly source in Numbers originally ended with an account of the death of Moses and succession of Joshua (\\"Then Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo...\\"), but when Deuteronomy was added to the Pentateuch this was transferred to the end of Deuteronomy.Campbell&O;'Brien, p.90 =Date= While most scholars consider P to be one of the latest strata of the Pentateuch, post-dating both J and D, since the 1970s a number of Jewish scholars have challenged this assumption, arguing for an early dating of the Priestly material. Avi Hurvitz, for example, has forcefully argued on linguistic grounds that P represents an earlier form of the Hebrew language than what is found in both Ezekiel and Deuteronomy, and therefore pre-dates both of them. These scholars often claim that the late-dating of P is due in large part to a Protestant bias in biblical studies which assumes that \\"priestly\\" and \\"ritualistic\\" material must represent a late degeneration of an earlier, \\"purer\\" faith. These arguments have not convinced the majority of scholars, however.

Schaffner with a screenplay by Gore Vidal based on his 1960 play of the same title. Starring Henry Fonda, Cliff Robertson, and Lee Tracy, the film details the seamy political maneuverings behind the nomination of a presidential candidate. The supporting cast features Edie Adams, Margaret Leighton, Ann Sothern, Shelley Berman, Gene Raymond, and Kevin McCarthy. Lee Tracy was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance, and it was his final film. Plot In May 1964, former Secretary of State William Russell (Henry Fonda) and Senator Joe Cantwell (Cliff Robertson) are the two leading candidates for the presidential nomination of an unspecified political party. Both have potentially fatal vulnerabilities. Russell is a principled intellectual (said by Vidal to be based on Adlai Stevenson). His sexual indiscretions and lack of attention to his wife Alice (Margaret Leighton) have alienated her. In addition, he has a past nervous breakdown to live down. Cantwell (whom Vidal wrote was based on Richard Nixon)Vidal, Gore, \\"United States: Essays 1952-1992,\\" p. 852. portrays himself as a populist \\"man of the people\\" and patriotic anti-communist campaigning to end \\"the missile gap\\" (a Kennedy campaign catch-phrase). He is a ruthless opportunist, willing to go to any lengths to get the nomination. Neither man can stand the other; neither believes his rival qualified to be president. At the nominating convention in Los Angeles, they lobby for the crucial support of dying former President Art Hockstader (Tracy). The pragmatic Hockstader (a character based on Harry S. Truman, particularly his comments on \\"striking a blow for liberty\\" whenever he drinks a bourbon) prefers Russell, but worries about his indecision and principles; he despises Cantwell for his lack of intellect, but appreciates his toughness and willingness to do whatever it takes. Hockstader decides to support Cantwell, but the candidate blunders badly. When the two speak privately, Cantwell attacks Russell using illegally obtained psychological reports obtained by Don Cantwell, his brother and campaign manager (clearly based on Bobby Kennedy, who was known as \\"Ruthless Robert\\" in political circles during the 1950s and early 1960s). Cantwell mistakenly assumed that Hockstader was going to endorse Russell. The former president tells Cantwell that he does not mind a \\"bastard,\\" but objects to a stupid one. He endorses neither man. Cantwell's attractive, ambitious wife (Edie Adams) actively campaigns, and Russell's wife pretends that everything is fine with their marriage. The candidates try to sway undecided delegates, Russell appealing to their principles and Cantwell using blackmail. Russell finds out to his chagrin that Hockstader has offered the vice-presidential spot on his ticket to all three of the minor candidates, Senator Oscar Anderson (Richard Arlen), Governor John Merwin (William R. Ebersol), and Governor T.T. Claypoole (John Henry Faulk). One of Russell's aides finds Sheldon Bascomb (Shelley Berman), who served in the military with Cantwell and is willing to link him to homosexual activity while stationed in Alaska during World War II. Hockstader and Russell's closest advisors press Russell to seize the opportunity, but he refuses to do so. After the first ballot, Russell arranges to meet Cantwell privately, but when Bascomb is confronted face-to-face by Cantwell, Cantwell refutes his slander. Russell threatens to use the allegation anyway, but Cantwell knows Russell does not have the stomach for such smear tactics. As the rounds of balloting continue, neither man has enough votes to win. Cantwell offers Russell the second spot on his ticket, but Russell shocks him by instead releasing his delegates and recommending they throw their support behind Merwin, who then secures the nomination.

The closing credits feature film clips depicting the faces and names of cast members Henry Fonda, Cliff Robertson, Edie Adams, Margaret Leighton, Shelley Berman, Lee Tracy, Ann Sothern, Gene Raymond, Kevin McCarthy and John Henry Faulk. Tracy received an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor nomination for repeating the role of Hockstader that he had originated on stage. Faulk was a Texas-based radio personality who was blacklisted during the 1950s and won a lawsuit that helped restore his reputation. Kevin McCarthy was a cousin of Eugene McCarthy, who became a presidential contender in 1968. Production It was Ebersol's only film and he does not speak. It was the first American film to feature the word \\"homosexual\\". Reception Bosley Crowther's review of the film in The New York Times cited William R. Ebersol in the role of Governor John Merwin as one of those who \\"stand out in a cast that is notable for its authenticity.\\" See also *List of American films of 1964 References External links  The Best Man at TV Guide (cut and heavily revised version of 1987 write- up originally published in The Motion Picture Guide) 1964 films 1960s political drama films American films American black-and-white films American political drama films English-language films Films about elections Films about fictional presidents of the United States American films based on plays Films based on works by Gore Vidal Films directed by Franklin J.

He died as the result of burns sustained in a fire during a 15-day low-pressure endurance experiment in Moscow. The government concealed the death, along with Bondarenko's membership in the cosmonaut corps, until 1980. A crater on the Moon's far side is named after him. Education and military training Bondarenko was born in Kharkov, Ukrainian SSR, Soviet Union. His father was sent to the Eastern Front in the first days of World War II. The youngster and his mother went through several years of hardship during the war. From an early age, Bondarenko was fascinated by aviation heroes and dreamed of becoming a military aviator himself. While still at Kharkov's Higher Air Force School, he was a member of the local aviation club.Biographies of USSR / Russian Cosmonauts: Bondarenko, Valentin Vasiliyevich spacefacts.de, Accessed 1 May 2019 After Bondarenko's graduation in 1954 he was admitted to the Voroshilovgrad Aviation Military Academy and a year later he was transferred to an Air Force College in Grozny, Armavir Military Pilot Aviation School, from which he graduated in 1957. In 1956 he married Galina Semenovna Rykova, a medical worker. Their first child was born later that year. During 1956, Bondarenko was sent to Armavir Higher Air Force Pilots School, graduating in 1957‚Äîthe same year Sputnik 1 was launched. Bondarenko was commissioned a Second Lieutenant, and served in the Soviet Air Force's PribVO (the former Baltic Military District). He was promoted to Senior Lieutenant in December 1959. Selection for cosmonaut training On 28 April 1960, Bondarenko was chosen to be among the first group of 20 cosmonauts. Bondarenko, \\"(also known as 'Valentin Junior' and 'Tinkerbell') was the youngest member of the cosmonaut team.\\"Clark, Phillip, \\"The Soviet Manned Space Program\\", Salamander Books Limited / Orion Books, a division of Crown Publishers, Inc., New York, 1988, Library of Congress card number 88-1551, , page 18. He began training on 31 May for a planned launch on the manned Vostok spacecraft. According to his fellow cosmonauts, Bondarenko was a mild-mannered person with a pleasant disposition. He had a good singing voice and played tennis well. Death 23 March 1961 was the tenth day of a 15-day endurance experiment in a low pressure altitude chamber at the Institute of Biomedical Problems in Moscow.Bondarenko, Valentin Vasiliyevich, Encyclopedia Astronautica, Accessed 1 May 2019 The chamber's atmosphere was at least 50% oxygen. Bondarenko, having completed work for the day, removed monitoring biosensors from his body and washed his skin with an alcohol-soaked cotton ball, which he then discarded. The cotton ball landed on an electric hot plate which he was using to brew a cup of tea. The cotton ignited and Bondarenko tried to smother the flames with the sleeve of his woolen coveralls, which caught fire in the chamber's oxygen-rich atmosphere. Because of the pressure difference, it took a watching doctor nearly half an hour to open the chamber door. Bondarenko's clothing burned until almost all the oxygen in the chamber was used up and he had suffered third-degree burns over most of his body. The attending physician at Botkin Hospital, surgeon and traumatologist Vladimir Golyakhovsky, recalled in 1984 that while attempting to start an intravenous drip, the only blood vessels he could find for inserting a needle were on the soles of Bondarenko's feet, where his flight boots had warded off the flames. According to Golyakhovsky, cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin spent several hours at the hospital as \\"deathwatch officer\\". Bondarenko died of shock 16 hours after the accident, less than three weeks before Gagarin's first spaceflight aboard Vostok 1.Oberg, James, Uncovering Soviet Disasters, Chapter 10: \\"Dead Cosmonauts\\", pp 156-176, Random House, New York, 1988, retrieved 8 January 2008 Manned orbital flight program director Nikolai Kamanin blamed Bondarenko's death on the Institute's poor organisation and control of the experiment. Bondarenko was buried in Lipovaya Roshcha in Kharkov,Burgess, Colin, Fallen Astronauts: Heroes Who Died Reaching for the Moon, page 163, Bison Books, 2003 where his parents were then living. On 17 June 1961 the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet posthumously awarded Bondarenko the Order of the Red Star. Aftermath News of Bondarenko's accident and death was not published at the time. Bondarenko had already appeared in group films and photos of the first cosmonaut group, and his unexplained disappearance sparked rumours of cosmonauts dying in failed launches. In 1980 the details of this incident were at last published in the West, and in 1986 Izvestia published an article by science writer Yaroslav Golovanov, detailing the incident for Soviet readers. James Oberg, in his book Red Star in Orbit, wrote how the Soviet government airbrushed out the cosmonaut's image from an official 1961 photograph of the first six cosmonauts selected for training, while British researcher Rex Hall showed that five people had been erased from an earlier group photograph of 16 cosmonauts. Clumsy attempts were later made to further doctor the historic photographs, with the insertion of imaginative but nonexistent photo details to account for the absence of the original members of the group. Bondarenko's death was caused by fire in a sealed, high-oxygen environment, which also befell the crew of Apollo 1. There was some later unfounded speculation that, had the Soviets been open about the circumstances of Bondarenko's death, NASA might have been alerted to the hazardous design of the early Apollo command module and would have made changes which could have prevented the 1967 deaths of the three Apollo 1 crew members.Charles, John, \\"Could the CIA have prevented the Apollo 1 fire?\\", Space Review, 29 January 2007, retrieved 5 January 2008 However, by 1966 the lethal hazards of a high-pressure 100-percent-oxygen environment such as Apollo 1's had been thoroughly described in American scientific publications and were well known to NASA.NASA History, SP-4204, Predictions of Trouble hq.nasa.gov, Accessed 1 May 2019 Books An account of Bondarenko's life appears in the 2003 book Fallen Astronauts: Heroes Who Died Reaching for the Moon by Colin Burgess.

The cistern, located southwest of the Hagia Sophia on the historical peninsula of Sarayburnu, was built in the 6th century during the reign of Byzantine Emperor Justinian I. Today it is kept with little water, for public access inside the space. History The second Medusa head pillar This subterranean cistern, in Greek kinsterne (Œ∫ŒπŒΩœÉœÑŒ≠œÅŒΩŒ∑), was called Basilica because it was located under a large public square on the First Hill of Constantinople, the Stoa Basilica. At this location, and prior to constructing the cistern, a great Basilica stood in its place, built between the 3rd and 4th centuries during the Early Roman Age as a commercial, legal and artistic centre. The basilica was reconstructed by Illus after a fire in 476. Ancient texts indicated that the basilica contained gardens, surrounded by a colonnade and facing the Hagia Sophia. According to ancient historians, Emperor Constantine built a structure that was later rebuilt and enlarged by Emperor Justinian after the Nika riots of 532, which devastated the city. Historical texts claim that 7,000 slaves were involved in the construction of the cistern. The enlarged cistern provided a water filtration system for the Great Palace of Constantinople and other buildings on the First Hill, and continued to provide water to the Topkapƒ± Palace after the Ottoman conquest in 1453 and into modern times. Measurements and data The Hen's Eye column. This cathedral-size cistern is an underground chamber approximately by ‚Äì about in area ‚Äì capable of holding of water. The ceiling is supported by a forest of 336 marble columns, each high, arranged in 12 rows of 28 columns each spaced apart. The capitals of the columns are mainly Ionic and Corinthian styles, with the exception of a few Doric style with no engravings. One of the columns is engraved with raised pictures of a Hen's Eye, slanted braches, and tears. This column resembles the columns of the Triumphal Arch of Theodosius I from the 4th century (AD 379‚Äì395), erected in the 'Forum Tauri' Square. Ancient texts suggest that the tears on the column pay tribute to the hundreds of slaves who died during the construction of the Basilica Cistern. The majority of the columns in the cistern appear to have been recycled from the ruins of older buildings (a process called 'spoliation'), likely brought to Constantinople from various parts of the empire, together with those that were used in the construction of Hagia Sophia. They are carved and engraved out of various types of marble and granite. Fifty-two stone steps descend into the entrance of the cistern. The cistern is surrounded by a firebrick wall with a thickness of and coated with a waterproofing mortar. The Basilica Cistern's water came from the Eƒürikapƒ± Water Distribution Center in the Belgrade Forest, which lie north of the city. It traveled through the Valens (Bozdoƒüan) Aqueduct, and the Maƒülova Aqueduct, which was built by the Emperor Justinian. The weight of the cistern lies on the columns by means of the cross-shaped vaults and round arches of its roof. The Basilica Cistern has undergone several restorations since its foundation. The first of the repairs were carried out twice during the Ottoman State in the 18th century during the reign of Ahmed III in 1723 by the architect Muhammad Agha of Kayseri. The second major repair was completed during the 19th century during the reign of Sultan Abdulhamid II (1876‚Äì1909). Cracks to masonry and damaged columns were repaired in 1968, with additional restoration in 1985 by the Istanbul Metropolitan Museum. During the 1985 restoration, 50,000 tons of mud were removed from the cisterns, and platforms built throughout to replace the boats once used to tour the cistern. The cistern was opened to the public in its current condition on 9 September 1987. In May 1994, the cistern underwent additional cleaning. Medusa column bases The sideways Medusa Located in the northwest corner of the cistern, the bases of two columns reuse blocks carved with the visage of Medusa. The origin of the two heads is unknown, though it is thought that the heads were brought to the cistern after being removed from a building of the late Roman period. There is no written evidence that suggests they were used as column pedestals previously. Tradition has it that the blocks are oriented sideways and inverted in order to negate the power of the Gorgons' gaze; however, it is widely thought that one was placed sideways only to be the proper size to support the column. The upside-down Medusa was placed that way specifically because she would be the same height right side up. In popular culture The cistern was used as a location for the 1963 James Bond film From Russia with Love. In the film, it is referred to as being constructed by the Emperor Constantine, with no reference to Justinian, and is located under the Soviet consulate. Its real-life location is a considerable distance from the former Soviet (now Russian) consulate, which is in Beyoƒülu, the \\"newer\\" European section of Istanbul, on the other side of the Golden Horn. In 1969, the cistern was used as a setting in Pawn in Frankincense, the fourth of the Lymond Chronicles books by Dorothy Dunnett. The finale of the 2009 film The International takes place in a fantasy amalgam of the Old City, depicting the Basilica Cistern as lying beneath the Sultan Ahmed Mosque, which, in the film, is directly adjacent to the S√ºleymaniye Mosque. The cistern is featured in Clive and Dirk Cussler's 2010 Dirk Pitt fiction novel, Crescent Dawn and The Navigator. In the 2011 video game, Assassin's Creed: Revelations, the player controlled character, Ezio Auditore, is given the chance to explore a section of this cistern in a memory sequence entitled The Yerebatan Cistern. The cistern is also featured in Jean-Baptiste Andrea's film thriller Brotherhood of Tears (2013). In the sequence, the lead character, acting as a transporter (played by Jeremie Renier), delivers a suitcase to a mysterious client (played by Turkish actor Ali Pinar). The cistern with its inverted Medusa pillar featured in the 2013 Dan Brown novel Inferno (as well as its 2016 film adaptation). In the young adult Marvel novel Black Widow: Forever Red by Margaret Stohl, published in October 2015, the climactic scenes take place in the cistern and in a secret lab hidden behind it.

Widely used, especially in Earth science, the protocol is layered on HTTP, and its current specification is DAP4,DAP4 Specification though the previous DAP2 version remains broadly used. Developed and advanced (openly and collaboratively) by the non-profit OPeNDAP, Inc.,Official website DAP is intended to enable remote, selective data-retrieval as an easily invoked Web service. OPeNDAP, Inc. also develops and maintains zero-cost (reference) implementations of the DAP protocol in both server-side and client-side software. \\"OPeNDAP\\" often is used in place of \\"DAP\\" to denote the protocol but also may refer to an entire DAP-based data-retrieval architecture. Other DAP-centered architectures, such as THREDDSTHREDDS and ERDDAP, the NOAA GEO-IDE UAF ERDDAPERDDAP exhibit significant interoperability with one another as well as with systems employing OPeNDAP's own (open-source) servers and software. A DAP client can be an ordinary browser or even a spreadsheet, though with limited functionality (see OPeNDAP's Web page on Available Client Software). More typically, DAP clients are: * Data-analysis or data-visualization tools (such as MATLAB, IDL, Panoply, GrADS, Integrated Data Viewer, Ferret and ncBrowseA Graphical netCDF File Browser) which their authors have adapted to enable DAP-based data input; * Similarly adapted Web applications (such as Dapper Data Viewer, aka DChart)OPeNDAP software * Similarly adapted end-user programs (in common languages) Regardless of their types, and whether developed commercially or by an end-user, clients almost universally link to DAP servers through libraries that implement the DAP2 or DAP4 protocol in one language or another. OPeNDAP offers open-source libraries in C++ and Java, but many clients rely on community developed libraries such as PyDAP or, especially, the NetCDF suite. Developed and maintained by the Unidata Program at the UCAR in multiple programming languages, all NetCDF libraries include embedded capabilities for retrieving (array-style) data from DAP servers. A data-using client references a data set by its URL and requests metadata or content by issuing (usually through an embedded DAP library) an HTTP request to a DAP server. Content requests usually are preceded by requests for metadata describing the structure and other details about the referenced data set. With this information, the client may construct DAP constraint expressionsDAP constraint expressions to retrieve specific content (i.e., subsets) from the source. OPeNDAP servers offer various types of responses, depending on the specific form of the client's request, including XML, JSON, HTML and ASCII. In response to requests for content, OPeNDAP servers can respond with multi-part mime documents that include a binary portion with NetCDF or DAP-native encoding. (These binary forms offer compact means to deliver large volumes of content, and the DAP-native form may even be streamed if desired.) OPeNDAP's software for building DAP servers (on top of Apache) is dubbed Hyrax and includes adapters that facilitate serving a wide variety of source data. DAP servers most frequently enable (remote) access to (large) HDF or NetCDF files, but the source data can exist in databases or other formats, including user-defined ones. When source data are organized as files, DAP retrievals enable, via subsetting, finer-grained access than does the FTP. Furthermore, OPeNDAP servers can aggregate subsets from multiple files for delivery in a single retrieval. Taken together, subsetting, aggregation and streaming can yield substantial data-access efficiencies, even in the presence of slow networks. OPeNDAP and other DAP servers are used operationally in government agencies, including NASA and NOAA, for providing access to Earth science data, including satellite imagery and other high- volume information sources. The DAP data model embraces a comprehensive set of data structures, including multidimensional arrays and nested sequences (i.e., records), complemented by a correspondingly rich set of constraint expressions. Hence the OPeNDAP data-retrieval architecture has demonstrated utility across a broad range of scientific data types, including data generated via simulations and data generated via observations (whether remotely sensed or measured in situ).

His greetings include \\"Welcome\\", \\"You've got mail\\", \\"You've got pictures\\", \\"You've got voicemail\\", \\"File's done\\", and \\"Goodbye\\", all recorded in his own living room on a cassette deck. In 1989, Edwards's wife overheard online service Q-Link CEO Steve Case describe how he wanted to add a voice to its user interface. In October, Edwards's voice premiered on AOL's new program. The voice is only heard in the American version of the software. In the UK version, a female voice (British actress Joanna Lumley) is heard replacing \\"Welcome\\" with \\"Welcome to AOL\\" and \\"You've got mail\\" with \\"You have e-mail\\" Also, \\"File's done\\" is replaced with \\"Your files have been transferred\\". His voice has also appeared in a 2000 episode of The Simpsons, \\"Little Big Mom\\" (where he provided the voice of a virtual doctor, saying \\"You've got leprosy\\"), and in advertising for the movie You've Got Mail. He started in radio while in high school. After high school he continued into television, working as a live booth announcer. Despite some on-air work, doing a car commercial, reporting news or sports and even a short stint as a weatherman (once proclaiming to New Bern, North Carolina, that \\"You've got hail.\\"), Edwards focused mainly on off-camera work. Semi-retired, he used to sell personalized .wav files through his website.

Life A writer and artist, Jackson is remembered today primarily for his literary collaboration with Merrill. The two men met in May 1953 in New York City, after a performance of Merrill's play, \\"The Bait.\\" They shared homes in Stonington, Connecticut; Athens, Greece; and Key West, Florida. \\"It was, I often thought, the happiest marriage I knew,\\" wrote Alison Lurie, who got to know both men in the 1950s and thought enough of the relationship to write a memoir about it more than forty years later, Familiar Spirits (2001). Over the course of decades conducting s√©ances with a Ouija board, Merrill and Jackson took down supernatural transcriptions and messages from otherworldly entities. Merrill's and Jackson's ouija transcriptions were first published in verse form in The Book of Ephraim (printed for the first time in Divine Comedies, 1976, which was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1977). Many critics consider Jackson to be a kind of co- writer, certainly the catalyst if not the medium, for much of James Merrill's most significant poetic output. The Book of Ephraim (1976), Mirabell: Books of Number (1978), and Scripts for the Pageant (1980) were all written with Jackson's assistance. Together, they constitute the epic trilogy The Changing Light at Sandover, a 560-page apocalyptic poem published in its entirety in 1982. He and James Merrill are buried side by side at Evergreen Cemetery, Stonington. Jackson's former wife and Merrill's friend, Doris Sewell Jackson is buried behind them.

Cook, Will Marion. Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. Retrieved 2011-09-16. Cook was a student of Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k. In 1919 he took his New York Syncopated Orchestra (Southern Syncopated Orchestra) to England for a command performance for King George V of the United Kingdom, and tour. Cook is probably best known for his popular songs and landmark Broadway musicals, featuring African-American creators, producers, and casts, such as Clorindy, or The Origin of the Cake Walk (1898) and In Dahomey (1903). The latter toured for four years, including in the United Kingdom and United States. Cook served as musical director of the George Walker-Bert Williams Company, working with the comedy partners on Clorindy, In Dahomey, and several other musical successes. Early life Will Marion Cook (n√© William Mercer Cook) was born soon after the Civil War in 1869 in Washington, D.C. to John Hartwell Cook and his wife Isabel. The senior Cook had been in the first class of the Howard University School of Law, graduating in 1871 and becoming one of the first black lawyers to practice in Washington. He served as \\"chief clerk of the Freedmen's Bureau from 1867 until 1872 and as professor and dean of the Howard University Law School from 1876 until 1878.\\"\\"Will Marion Cook Family Residence Site, African American Heritage Trail\\", DC Cultural Tourism, 2019\\"Will Marion Cook (1869-1944)\\", Library of Congress His parents were free people of color before the war, and stressed education; Cook had graduated from Oberlin College. After John Cook died of tuberculosis in 1879, the widowed Isabel struggled to keep her family going. She eventually had to send all her three children away to live with other family. Will at age 10 had a violent altercation with a teacher who strapped him, and he was sent to live with his maternal grandparents in Chattanooga, Tennessee. They were former slaves who had bought their freedom before the war. With them he heard what he described as \\"real Negro melodies\\" and folk music, during what he would later call his \\"soul period\\".Carter (2008), pp. 6‚Äì10. After a year, his grandfather returned Will to his mother, believing it best for Will not to be in the South.Carter (2008), pp. 9‚Äì12. Washington, DC had a sizeable community of African Americans, many free before the war, and had developed an educated class. Soon after being reunited with his mother, Will decided to be serious about his music. He started to study violin at Oberlin Conservatory in Ohio at age 14. Cook's musical talent was apparent at an early age. At Oberlin, he was a student of Frederick G. Doolittle, as well as Fenelon Rice, L. Celestia Wattles, and Calvin B. Cady. With help from members of the African-American community, his benefit recitals were sponsored in order to help him afford to study abroad. From 1887 to 1889, Cook studied at the Berlin Hochschule fur Musik, working with violinist Heinrich Jacobson; Jacobson served as Chairman of the Orchestral Instruments Department. Jacobson was a former student of Hungarian violinistJoseph Joachim, considered one of the supreme musicians of the age. Some accounts state that Cook studied abroad for nine years, but this has not been documented. Marriage Will Marion Cook In 1898 Cook married the young singer Abbie Mitchell; she was 14. They had a daughter, Marion Abigail Cook, in 1900, and a son, Will Mercer Cook, known as Mercer, in 1903. Their daughter was raised by family members as Mitchell herself had been.\\"Abbie Mitchell\\", in Notable Black American Women, Book 1. Gale Research, 1992.

Will Mercer Cook became a professor of history at Howard University and later was appointed as United States Ambassador to Niger and Senegal.\\"Mercer Cook\\", Answers.com.\\"Mercer Cook Biography\\", The History Makers. Studies with Dvo≈ô√°k During 1894 and 1895, Cook studied with Czech composer Antonin Dvo≈ô√°k, who was working in the United States for a period, and John White at the National Conservatory of Music. Cook had performed professionally as a student and made his debut in 1889 in Washington, DC. His performance career as a soloist was short lived, however. Reacting to the stricter segregation of performers in the classical music community, Cook found a home in the musical theatre. Touring and composing Edward E. Rice's production of Cook's Clorindy, featuring the song \\"Darktown is Out Tonight\\" In 1890, Cook became director of a chamber orchestra touring the East Coast. He prepared Scenes from the Opera of Uncle Tom's Cabin for performance. The performance, which was to take place at the Chicago World's Fair in 1893, was canceled. He gained a production in 1898 of his Clorindy: The Origin of the Cakewalk, a one-act musical comedy created in collaboration with poet Paul Laurence Dunbar. It was the first all-black show to play at a prestigious Broadway house; it was staged on the Roof Garden of the Casino Theatre.Woll, Allen (1989). Black Musical Theater. Louisiana State University Press. . Because it was not staged in the theatre, and was not a full-length production, it does not have the landmark status of Cook's 1903 musical In Dahomey (see next paragraph). After this period, Cook served as composer-in- chief and musical director for the George Walker-Bert Williams Company, an African-American agency started by two top vaudeville comedians who had been performing together for a decade. As Cook continued to compose, he also produced many successful musicals. Chief among them was In Dahomey: (1903). This is generally considered Cook's landmark show, which was developed with Williams & Walker, who starred in it. J. A. Shipp wrote the book, and poet Paul Laurence Dunbar the lyrics. Theatre historian Gerald Bordman says that this is \\"the first full-length musical written and played by blacks to be performed at a major Broadway house.\\"Bordman, Gerald, Musical Theatre: A Chronicle (New York: Oxford University Press, 1978), p. 190. It was also notable for featuring the two leading vaudeville performers of the day, and for satirically addressing elements of African-American and US history, developing its characters well beyond the stereotypes of the day. After its opening, the musical was taken on tour to the United Kingdom. It returned in a revival in New York in 1904, and then toured the United States as well. Best known for his songs, Cook used folk elements in an original and distinct manner. Many of these songs were first performed in his musicals. The songs were written for choral groups or for solo singers. Some were published in A Collection of Negro Songs (1912). Later in his career, Cook was an active choral and orchestral conductor. He produced several concerts. He also organized many choral societies in both New York City and in Washington, D.C. The New York Syncopated Orchestra, which he founded, toured the United States in 1918 and went to England in 1919 for a command performance for King George V. Known also as the Southern Syncopated Orchestra, it sought to bring jazz and ragtime to other countries, and toured in England and Europe. Among his company were assistant director Will Tyers, jazz clarinetist Sidney Bechet, and Cook's wife, Abbie Mitchell. Cook also mentored younger musicians, such as Eubie Blake and Duke Ellington, who became renowned in successful careers of their own. One of his last shows was Swing Along (1929), written with Will Vodery. In 1944, Cook was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and was admitted in June to Harlem Hospital in New York City. He died 29 days later in the hospital, on July 19, 1944, from cancer and a heart ailment.Carter (2008), pp. 109‚Äì110. Cook is buried in Washington, D.C's Woodlawn Cemetery.

Each female citrus long-horned beetle can make up to 200 eggs after mating, and each egg is separately deposited in tree bark. After the beetle larvae hatches, it chews into the tree, forming a tunnel that is then used as a place for beetle pupation (the process of growing from larvae to adult). From egg- laying to pupation and adult emergence can take twelve to eighteen months. Infestations by the beetle can kill many different types of hardwood trees as well as citrus trees, pecan, apple, Australian pine, hibiscus, sycamore, willow, pear, mulberry, pigeon pea, Chinaberry, poplar, litchi, kumquat, Japanese red cedar, oak, and Ficus.  In America  The citrus long-horned beetle poses an unprecedented threat to the environment in North America because it attacks healthy trees and has no natural enemies. Not only are greenbelts, urban landscapes and backyard trees at jeopardy, but also orchards, forests, and endangered salmon, and wildlife habitat. The citrus long-horned beetle was first discovered in the U.S. in April 1999, when a single beetle was found in a nursery greenhouse in Athens, Georgia on certain bonsai trees imported from China. More seriously, the beetle was later discovered on 9 August 2001, at a Tukwila, Washington nursery near Seattle in a shipment from Korea of 369 bonsai maple trees. Three of the beetles were captured at the nursery, including a mated female ready to lay eggs, but when the bonsai trees were dissected, eight larvae exit tunnels were found, indicating that five more might have escaped into the surrounding community. Those five could lead to thousands of others because females lay 200 eggs at a time beneath the bark of trees. Because this beetle may have other outlying infestations that are yet to be discovered, it is important not to move firewood even in areas with no known pest infestations.

In classic sudoku, the objective is to fill a 9√ó9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3√ó3 subgrids that compose the grid (also called \\"boxes\\", \\"blocks\\", or \\"regions\\") contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution. Completed games are always an example of a Latin square, including an additional constraint on the contents of individual regions. For example, the same single integer may not appear twice in the same row, column, or any of the nine 3√ó3 subregions of the 9√ó9 playing board. French newspapers featured variations of the Sudoku puzzles in the 19th century, and the puzzle has appeared since 1979 in puzzle books under the name Number Place. However, the modern Sudoku only began to gain widespread popularity in 1986 when it was published by the Japanese puzzle company Nikoli under the name Sudoku, meaning \\"single number\\". It first appeared in a U.S. newspaper, and then The Times (London), in 2004, thanks to the efforts of Wayne Gould, who devised a computer program to rapidly produce unique puzzles. History From La France newspaper, July 6, 1895: The puzzle instructions read, \\"Use the numbers 1 to 9 each nine times to complete the grid in such a way that the horizontal, vertical, and two main diagonal lines all add up to the same total.\\" =Predecessors= Number puzzles appeared in newspapers in the late 19th century, when French puzzle setters began experimenting with removing numbers from magic squares. Le Si√®cle, a Paris daily, published a partially completed 9√ó9 magic square with 3√ó3 subsquares on November 19, 1892. It was not a Sudoku because it contained double-digit numbers and required arithmetic rather than logic to solve, but it shared key characteristics: each row, column and subsquare added up to the same number. On July 6, 1895, Le Si√®cle rival, La France, refined the puzzle so that it was almost a modern Sudoku and named it ('evil magic square'). It simplified the 9√ó9 magic square puzzle so that each row, column, and broken diagonals contained only the numbers 1‚Äì9, but did not mark the subsquares. Although they are unmarked, each 3√ó3 subsquare does indeed comprise the numbers 1‚Äì9 and the additional constraint on the broken diagonals leads to only one solution. These weekly puzzles were a feature of French newspapers such as L'√âcho de Paris for about a decade, but disappeared about the time of World War I. =Modern Sudoku= The modern Sudoku was most likely designed anonymously by Howard Garns, a 74-year-old retired architect and freelance puzzle constructor from Connersville, Indiana, and first published in 1979 by Dell Magazines as Number Place (the earliest known examples of modern Sudoku). Garns's name was always present on the list of contributors in issues of Dell Pencil Puzzles and Word Games that included Number Place, and was always absent from issues that did not. He died in 1989 before getting a chance to see his creation as a worldwide phenomenon. Whether or not Garns was familiar with any of the French newspapers listed above is unclear. The puzzle was introduced in Japan by Nikoli in the paper Monthly Nikolist in April 1984 as , which also can be translated as \\"the digits must be single\\" or \\"the digits are limited to one occurrence\\" (In Japanese, dokushin means an \\"unmarried person\\"). At a later date, the name was abbreviated to Sudoku (Êï∞Áã¨) by , taking only the first kanji of compound words to form a shorter version. \\"Sudoku\\" is a registered trademark in Japan and the puzzle is generally referred to as or, more informally, a portmanteau of the two words, . In 1986, Nikoli introduced two innovations: the number of givens was restricted to no more than 32, and puzzles became \\"symmetrical\\" (meaning the givens were distributed in rotationally symmetric cells). It is now published in mainstream Japanese periodicals, such as the Asahi Shimbun. Cognitive scientist Jeremy Grabbe found that Sudoku involved an area of cognition called working memory. A subsequent experiment by Grabbe showed that routine Sudoku playing could improve working memory in older people. = Spread outside Japan = In 1997, Hong Kong judge Wayne Gould saw a partly completed puzzle in a Japanese bookshop. Over six years, he developed a computer program to produce unique puzzles rapidly. Knowing that British newspapers have a long history of publishing crosswords and other puzzles, he promoted Sudoku to The Times in Britain, which launched it on November 12, 2004 (calling it Su Doku). The first letter to The Times regarding Su Doku was published the following day on November 13 from Ian Payn of Brentford, complaining that the puzzle had caused him to miss his stop on the tube.\\"Letters\\". Timesonline.co.uk. November 14, 2004. Sudoku puzzles rapidly spread to other newspapers as a regular feature. The rapid rise of Sudoku in Britain from relative obscurity to a front-page feature in national newspapers attracted commentary in the media and parody (such as when The Guardian G2 section advertised itself as the first newspaper supplement with a Sudoku grid on every page). Recognizing the different psychological appeals of easy and difficult puzzles, The Times introduced both, side by side, on June 20, 2005. From July 2005, Channel 4 included a daily Sudoku game in their teletext service. On August 2, the BBC's program guide Radio Times featured a weekly Super Sudoku with a 16√ó16 grid. In the United States, the first newspaper to publish a Sudoku puzzle by Wayne Gould was The Conway Daily Sun (New Hampshire), in 2004. The world's first live TV Sudoku show, July 1, 2005, Sky One The world's first live TV Sudoku show, Sudoku Live, was a puzzle contest first broadcast on July 1, 2005, on Sky One. It was presented by Carol Vorderman. Nine teams of nine players (with one celebrity in each team) representing geographical regions competed to solve a puzzle. Each player had a hand-held device for entering numbers corresponding to answers for four cells. Phil Kollin of Winchelsea, England, was the series grand prize winner, taking home over ¬£23,000 over a series of games. The audience at home was in a separate interactive competition, which was won by Hannah Withey of Cheshire. Later in 2005, the BBC launched SUDO-Q, a game show that combined Sudoku with general knowledge. However, it used only 4√ó4 and 6√ó6 puzzles. Four seasons were produced before the show ended in 2007. In 2006, a Sudoku website published songwriter Peter Levy's Sudoku tribute song, but quickly had to take down the MP3 file due to heavy traffic. British and Australian radio picked up the song, which is to feature in a British-made Sudoku documentary. The Japanese Embassy also nominated the song for an award, with Levy doing talks with Sony in Japan to release the song as a single. Sudoku software is very popular on PCs, websites, and mobile phones. It comes with many distributions of Linux. Software has also been released on video game consoles, such as the Nintendo DS, PlayStation Portable, the Game Boy Advance, Xbox Live Arcade, the Nook e-book reader, Kindle Fire tablet, several iPod models, and the iPhone. Many Nokia phones also had Sudoku. In fact, just two weeks after Apple Inc. debuted the online App Store within its iTunes Store on July 11, 2008, nearly 30 different Sudoku games were already in it, created by various software developers, specifically for the iPhone and iPod Touch. One of the most popular video games featuring Sudoku is Brain Age: Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day!. Critically and commercially well-received, it generated particular praise for its Sudoku implementation\\"Brain Age: ... Review\\". IGN.com. and sold more than 8 million copies worldwide. Due to its popularity, Nintendo made a second Brain Age game titled Brain Age2, which has over 100 new Sudoku puzzles and other activities. In June 2008, an Australian drugs-related jury trial costing over A$ 1 million was aborted when it was discovered that five of the twelve jurors had been playing Sudoku instead of listening to evidence.  Variants  = Variations of grid sizes or region shapes = Although the 9√ó9 grid with 3√ó3 regions is by far the most common, many other variations exist. Sample puzzles can be 4√ó4 grids with 2√ó2 regions; 5√ó5 grids with pentomino regions have been published under the name Logi-5; the World Puzzle Championship has featured a 6√ó6 grid with 2√ó3 regions and a 7√ó7 grid with six heptomino regions and a disjoint region. Larger grids are also possible, or different irregular shapes (under various names such as Suguru, Tectonic, Jigsaw Sudoku etc.). The Times offers a 12√ó12-grid \\"Dodeka Sudoku\\" with 12 regions of 4√ó3 squares. Dell Magazines regularly publishes 16√ó16 \\"Number Place Challenger\\" puzzles (using the numbers 1‚Äì16 or the letters A-P). Nikoli offers 25√ó25 \\"Sudoku the Giant\\" behemoths. A 100√ó100-grid puzzle dubbed Sudoku-zilla was published in 2010.  Mini Sudoku  Under the name \\"Mini Sudoku\\", a 6√ó6 variant with 3√ó2 regions appears in the American newspaper USA Today and elsewhere. The object is the same as that of standard Sudoku, but the puzzle only uses the numbers 1 through 6. A similar form, for younger solvers of puzzles, called \\"The Junior Sudoku\\", has appeared in some newspapers, such as some editions of The Daily Mail. = Imposing additional constraints = Another common variant is to add limits on the placement of numbers beyond the usual row, column, and box requirements. Often, the limit takes the form of an extra \\"dimension\\"; the most common is to require the numbers in the main diagonals of the grid to also be unique. The aforementioned \\"Number Place Challenger\\" puzzles are all of this variant, as are the Sudoku X puzzles in The Daily Mail, which use 6√ó6 grids. = Killer Sudoku = The Killer Sudoku variant combines elements of Sudoku and Kakuro. = Alphabetical Sudoku = Alphabetical variations have emerged, sometimes called Wordoku; no functional difference exists in the puzzle unless the letters spell something. Some variants, such as in the TV Guide, include a word reading along a main diagonal, row, or column once solved; determining the word in advance can be viewed as a solving aid. A Wordoku might contain words other than the main word. \\"Quadratum latinum\\" is a Sudoku variation with Roman numerals (I, II, III, IV, ..., IX) proposed by Hebdomada aenigmatum, a monthly magazine of Latin puzzles and crosswords. Like the Wordoku, it presents no functional difference from a normal Sudoku, but adds the visual difficulty of using Roman numerals. = Hyper Sudoku = Hyper Sudoku uses the classic 9√ó9 grid with 3√ó3 regions, but defines four additional interior 3√ó3 regions in which the numbers 1‚Äì9 must appear exactly once. It was invented by Peter Ritmeester and first published by him in Dutch Newspaper NRC Handelsblad in October 2005, and since April 2007 on a daily basis in The International New York Times (International Herald Tribune). The first time it was called Hyper Sudoku was in Will Shortz's Favorite Sudoku Variations (February 2006). It is also known as Windoku because with the grid's four interior regions shaded, it resembles a window with glazing bars. = Twin Sudoku = In Twin Sudoku two regular grids share a 3√ó3 box. This is one of many possible types of overlapping grids. The rules for each individual grid are the same as in normal Sudoku, but the digits in the overlapping section are shared by each half. In some compositions neither individual grid can be solved alone ‚Äì the complete solution is only possible after each individual grid has at least been partially solved. = Other variants = Puzzles constructed from more than two grids are also common. Five 9√ó9 grids that overlap at the corner regions in the shape of a quincunx is known in Japan as Gattai 5 (five merged) Sudoku. In The Times, The Age, and The Sydney Morning Herald, this form of puzzle is known as Samurai Sudoku. The Baltimore Sun and the Toronto Star publish a puzzle of this variant (titled High Five) in their Sunday edition. Often, no givens are placed in the overlapping regions. Sequential grids, as opposed to overlapping, are also published, with values in specific locations in grids needing to be transferred to others. An example of Greater Than Sudoku A tabletop version of Sudoku can be played with a standard 81-card Set deck (see Set game). A three-dimensional Sudoku puzzle was published in The Daily Telegraph in May 2005. The Times also publishes a three-dimensional version under the name Tredoku. Also, a Sudoku version of the Rubik's Cube is named Sudoku Cube. Many other variants have been developed.* Some are different shapes in the arrangement of overlapping 9√ó9 grids, such as butterfly, windmill, or flower. Others vary the logic for solving the grid. One of these is \\"Greater Than Sudoku\\". In this, a 3√ó3 grid of the Sudoku is given with 12 symbols of Greater Than (>) or Less Than (<) on the common line of the two adjacent numbers. Another variant on the logic of solution is \\"Clueless Sudoku\\", in which nine 9√ó9 Sudoku grids are each placed in a 3√ó3 array. The center cell in each 3√ó3 grid of all nine puzzles is left blank and form a tenth Sudoku puzzle without any cell completed; hence, \\"clueless\\". A new variant mixes Sudoku with the sliding tile puzzle in Sudoku Slide Extreme. In this variant all all of the positions are filled in. Tiles are moved to the proper position to solve the puzzle. This variant contains power-ups and a campaign mode. Examples and other variants can be found in the Glossary of Sudoku.  Mathematics of Sudoku  automorphic Sudoku with 18 clues and two- way diagonal symmetry This section refers to classic Sudoku, disregarding jigsaw, hyper, and other variants. A completed Sudoku grid is a special type of Latin square with the additional property of no repeated values in any of the nine blocks (or boxes of 3√ó3 cells). The relationship between the two theories is known, after it was proven that a first-order formula that does not mention blocks is valid for Sudoku if and only if it is valid for Latin squares. The general problem of solving Sudoku puzzles on n2√ón2 grids of n√ón blocks is known to be NP-complete. Many computer algorithms, such as backtracking and dancing links can solve most 9√ó9 puzzles efficiently, but combinatorial explosion occurs as n increases, creating limits to the properties of Sudokus that can be constructed, analyzed, and solved as n increases. A Sudoku puzzle can be expressed as a graph coloring problem.Lewis, R. A Guide to Graph Colouring: Algorithms and Applications. Springer International Publishers, 2015. The aim is to construct a 9-coloring of a particular graph, given a partial 9-coloring. The fewest clues possible for a proper Sudoku is 17 (proven January 2012, and confirmed September 2013).G. McGuire, B. Tugemann, G. Civario. \\"There is no 16-Clue Sudoku: Solving the Sudoku Minimum Number of Clues Problem\\". Arxiv.org.H.H. Lin, I-C. Wu. \\"No 16-clue Sudoku puzzles by sudoku@vtaiwan project\\", September, 2013. Over 49,000 Sudokus with 17 clues have been found, many by Japanese enthusiasts. Sudokus with 18 clues and rotational symmetry have been found, and there is at least one Sudoku that has 18 clues, exhibits two-way diagonal symmetry and is automorphic. The maximum number of clues that can be provided while still not rendering a unique solution is four short of a full grid (77); if two instances of two numbers each are missing from cells that occupy the corners of an orthogonal rectangle, and exactly two of these cells are within one region, the numbers can be assigned two ways. Since this applies to Latin squares in general, most variants of Sudoku have the same maximum. The number of classic 9√ó9 Sudoku solution grids is 6,670,903,752,021,072,936,960 , or around . This is roughly times the number of 9√ó9 Latin squares. Detailed calculation of this figure. Various other grid sizes have also been enumerated‚Äîsee the main article for details. The number of essentially different solutions, when symmetries such as rotation, reflection, permutation, and relabelling are taken into account, was shown to be just 5,472,730,538 . Unlike the number of complete Sudoku grids, the number of minimal 9√ó9 Sudoku puzzles is not precisely known. (A minimal puzzle is one in which no clue can be deleted without losing uniqueness of the solution.) However, statistical techniques combined with a puzzle generator show that about (with 0.065% relative error) 3.10 √ó 1037 minimal puzzles and 2.55 √ó 1025 nonessentially equivalent minimal puzzles exist.  Competitions  Sudoku competition at SM City Baliuag * The first World Sudoku Championship was held in Lucca, Italy, from March 10 to 12, 2006. The winner was Jana Tylov√° of the Czech Republic. The competition included numerous variants. * The second World Sudoku Championship was held in Prague, Czech Republic, from March 28 to April 1, 2007. The individual champion was Thomas Snyder of the USA. The team champion was Japan. * The third World Sudoku Championship was held in Goa, India, from April 14 to 16, 2008. Thomas Snyder repeated as the individual overall champion, and also won the first ever Classic Trophy (a subset of the competition counting only classic Sudoku). The Czech Republic won the team competition. * The fourth World Sudoku Championship was held in ≈Ωilina, Slovakia, from April 24 to 27, 2009. After past champion Thomas Snyder of the USA won the general qualification, Jan Mrozowski of Poland emerged from a 36-competitor playoff to become the new World Sudoku Champion. Host nation Slovakia emerged as the top team in a separate competition of three-membered squads. * The fifth World Sudoku Championship was held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, from April 29 to May 2, 2010. Jan Mrozowski of Poland successfully defended his world title in the individual competition, while Germany won a separate team event. The puzzles were written by Thomas Snyder and Wei-Hwa Huang, both past U.S. Sudoku champions. * The 12th World Sudoku Championship (WSC) was held in Bangalore, India, from October 15 to 22, 2017. Kota Morinishi of Japan won the Individual WSC and China won the team event. * The 13th World Sudoku Championship took place in the Czech Republic. * In the United States, The Philadelphia Inquirer Sudoku National Championship has been held three times, each time offering a $10,000 prize to the advanced division winner and a spot on the U.S. National Sudoku Team traveling to the world championships. The winners of the event were Thomas Snyder (2007), Wei-Hwa Huang (2008), and Tammy McLeod (2009). In the 2009 event, the third-place finalist in the advanced division, Eugene Varshavsky, performed quite poorly onstage after setting a very fast qualifying time on paper, which caught the attention of organizers and competitors including past champion Thomas Snyder, who requested organizers reconsider his results due to a suspicion of cheating. Following an investigation and a retest of Varshavsky, the organizers disqualified him and awarded Chris Narrikkattu third place.

This was a time when few people had televisions, and radio was all-important as a medium, and had huge audiences. The show was broadcast on Sunday evenings between 5.30pm and 6pm over the powerful Long Wave transmitter and the show became well known throughout the UK for its theme song We Are The Ovaltineys. Members of the club received a membership badge and book and the chance to take part in competitions and other activities. There was a weekly comic too.

He was a natural child of Friedrich Wilhelm von Stenger (1770‚Äì1832) and was registered in the Russian nobility on 4 May 1837. Feodor Trepov began his military career in 1831 by participating in the suppression of the November Uprising in Poland in 1830 and 1831. He then commanded a cavalry regiment of gendarmes in Kiev. He distinguished himself during the suppression of another uprising in Poland in 1863‚Äì1864He became somewhat infamous in Warsaw for his brutality and impunity. A popular folk tune recalls a situation in which Trepov, then in the rank of Colonel, assaulted a passerby on the streets of Warsaw's old town. The civilian fought back, hitting Trepov's face with his cane. See: After Dmitry Karakozov's assassination attempt on Alexander II in 1866, Trepov was appointed chief of Saint Petersburg's police force. He managed to put the city in order and improved the performance of the police. In 1867, Trepov was promoted to the rank of adjutant general. He was the Governor of St. Petersburg between 1873 and 1878. In 1878, Vera Zasulich shot and wounded Trepov after he had ordered the flogging of a political prisoner.

History Wildenschwert was founded in the second half of the 13th century, during the reign of Ottokar II of Bohemia. It was first called Wilhelmswert after Wilhelm von D√ºrnholz, who was one of the colonizer, and was part of the Herrschaft Landskron. The town was first mentioned in a written document from 1285, when the Bohemian King Wenceslaus II gifted the town to Zavis of Falkenstein. In 1292, after Zavis' death, Wenceslaus II gifted the town to the Cistercian monks at K√∂nigsaal. They passed the town to the Leitomischl bishopric in 1358. After the Hussite Rebellion, when the churches influence was eclipsed, the town was owned by the Kostka von Postupice, the von Pernstein and the Hrzan von Harras families. Wildenschwert was first referred to as a town in 1544. Since the end of the fifteenth century Wildenschwert was host to the Bohemian Brethren but expelled them in 1626 in the wake of the counter-reformation. Then after the Battle of White Mountain, 8 November 1620, Wildenschwert was under the control of the Dukes of Liechtenstein. There were Guilds of Weavers established here in the sixteenth century. The town was slow to recover from the lootings of the Thirty Years' War, then was destroyed by fire in 1706. It gained municipal status in 1795. When Wildenschwert was connected to the railway network by the Olomouc ‚Äì Prague Line in 1845, the textile business boomed. It gained the tagline of The Manchester of Eastern Bohemia, and became an important textile centre. It was an important railway junction and from 1850 became a regional centre. It was given the Czech name of Oust√≠ or Austi; the nad Orlic√≠ refers to the name of the local river. Wildenschwert was a German-speaking town in Austria-Hungary until it was allocated to Czechoslovakia in 1918 at the conclusion of the World War I. √öst√≠ nad Orlic√≠ as it was now called remained an important textile town, and in the 1960s the V√Ωzkumn√Ω √∫stav bavln√°≈ôsk√Ω (Cotton Researching Institute) developed the Open end spinning technique that provided a faster alternative to ring spinning.

It was originally broadcast on Channel 5 from 2002 to 2011, afterwards moving to Discovery Channel in 2012, and then in 2015 to History. Since its return in 2018, it has been broadcast on Quest. The show is currently presented by Vicki Butler- Henderson, Jonny Smith and Jason Plato. Its former presenters include former racing driver Tiff Needell. Fifth Gear was first broadcast on 8 April 2002 as 5th Gear, and as a continuation of the original incarnation of the BBC show Top Gear, which was cancelled in 2001. Top Gear was relaunched later that year; Channel 5 originally wanted to carry on using the Top Gear name, but the BBC refused as it still operated the Top Gear magazine. Several of Top Gear's ex-presenters, including Quentin Willson, Tiff Needell, and Vicki Butler- Henderson, were hired by Channel 5 to present the series. The show's name was restyled as Fifth Gear in 2005. Needell announced the show's second cancellation on 24 May 2016. On 14 June 2018, Needell announced on his official Twitter account that he had been doing some filming work for a new series of Fifth Gear which would air in September on Quest. Repeats of Fifth Gear also started being broadcast on UKTV channel Dave in April 2008 and later on Discovery Turbo, with early episodes of the show being streamed '24/7' via the British feed of Pluto TV in 2019.https://www.eu- landing.corp.pluto.tv/channels Format The first seven series consisted of a 23-minute programme, not including approximately 7 minutes of adverts. The eighth series returned in the autumn of 2005 in a longer format of 45 minutes, and the ninth series (which went to a 13-week run) was increased to a one-hour airtime slot (approximately 46 minutes excluding adverts). For series 17, the show has reverted to the original format of 23 minutes, which including adverts takes the show to half an hour. In Series 21, the show reverted to the previous one-hour airtime slot. =Locations= At the start of series 10, the show introduced between-feature links filmed at the Ace Cafe in London. In previous series, these links were filmed at the production company offices in Birmingham. Originally produced by Chrysalis Television, the Birmingham offices were situated on the top floor of the headquarters of 100.7 Heart FM (also, at that time, a Chrysalis Radio company), near Birmingham's Five Ways area. The team moved out when Chrysalis sold its television division to All3Media in September 2003 (the section which later produced Fifth Gear is now known as North One Television, part of the All3Media group). In series 14, a location change from the Ace Cafe meant link sequences were filmed instead at the Millbrook Proving Ground, along with some of the vehicle testing features. =Presenter line-up= *Tiff Needell (2002‚Äì16, 2018) *Vicki Butler- Henderson (2002‚Äì16, 2018‚Äìpresent) *Jonny Smith (2006‚Äì16, 2018‚Äìpresent) *Jason Plato (2004‚Äì14, 2018‚Äìpresent) *Tom Ford (2002‚Äì09) *Adrian Simpson (2002‚Äì06) *Quentin Willson (2002‚Äì04) ;Short-lived stints In 2005, the show's producer, Jon Bentley, also became a part-time presenter for a year before he went back to being solely the producer.

On 8 January 2010, Smith tweeted: \\"Fifth Gear IS coming back!\\", and in his next tweet, he said \\"Wow, such quick responses! Basically, we all know there's room for two car TV shows. FG will simply be a reviews based visual car magazine.\\" Tiff Needell also tweeted saying \\"Home to the news that, after much negotiating Fifth Gear looks like it will after all be returning to your screens sometime in the Spring!\\" and also hinted the show will have a new format in his next tweet \\"Glad so many of you are delighted by the Fifth Gear news ‚Äî and, yes the format will be moving away from the stupid ... but still having fun!\\" On 17 January 2010, Vicki Butler-Henderson and Tiff Needell confirmed at the Autosport International Show that Fifth Gear will be returning in Spring 2010.

According to the Iroquoians, there was a kingdom to the north, of blond men rich with gold and furs, in a place they called Saguenay. Jacques Cartier first described finding the Saguenay River on his second voyage in 1536; he had with him Chief Donnacona's sons who told him it was the way to the Kingdom of Saguenay. While imprisoned in France in the 1530s, Donnacona himself also told stories about it, claiming it had great mines of silver and gold. French explorers in Canada looked for this kingdom in vain. Today, it is typically understood to be entirely mythical, a European misunderstanding (or made up), or an Iroquoian attempt to trick or confuse the French. However, some people have speculated it was an ancient, pre-Columbian European settlement to which the Iroquoian oral tradition referred, such as the Norse settlement at L'Anse aux Meadows. The name Saguenay survived in many modern placenames. The modern-day Saguenay region, including the city of Saguenay (Chicoutimi-Jonqui√®re), is on both shores of the Saguenay River in Quebec. As the name of the river, the Kingdom has also become the namesake of Saguenay Herald at the Canadian Heraldic Authority. It is part of the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean administrative region. Today, the Saguenay-Lac-Saint- Jean region is sometimes referred to metaphorically as the Kingdom of the Saguenay (Royaume du Saguenay), for example in tourist marketing. Unrelated to the legend, a micronational project in the Saguenay region, Le Royaume de L'Anse-Saint-Jean, achieved a certain amount of prominence in 1997. The name Saguenay is not related to Saginaw, the name of a river, bay and city in Michigan that is of Ojibway origin.

David Barnard Steinman (June 11, 1886most probable date - August 21, 1960) was an American civil engineer. He was the designer of the Mackinac Bridge and many other notable bridges, and a published author. He grew up in New York City's lower Manhattan, and lived with the ambition of making his mark on the Brooklyn Bridge that he lived under. In 1906 he earned a bachelor's degree from City College and in 1909, a Master of Arts from Columbia University and a Doctorate in 1911. He also received an honorary Doctor of Science in Engineering on 15 April 1952 from degree mill Sequoia University, but would distance himself from it after the 1957 inquiry and not include it in his biographies. He was awarded the Franklin Institute's Louis E. Levy Medal in 1957. David B. Steinman built bridges in the United States, Thailand, England, Portugal, Italy, Brazil, Haiti, Puerto Rico, Canada, Korea, Iraq and Pakistan. He had a literary bent, and was a published author with several books, articles in advancement of his craft, and even had children's books and poetry to his credit. Early life Steinman was the child of Jewish immigrants. Little is known of his family and early childhood other than that he had 6 siblings. There is some controversy about where and when he was born. Some sourcesFor example, his biography at Structurae have him born in Chomsk (–•–æ–º—Å–∫ ◊ó◊ï◊û◊°◊ß), Brest, Belarus in 1886, and emigrating to the United States with his family in 1890. However other sources, including Ratigan,Ratigan, W. (1959). \\"Highways Over Broad Waters.\\" Grand Rapids: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing. ASIN B0007IY0OC, page 11; \\"a boy born under the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge\\" and Steinman himselfThe back flap biography of Steinman's children's book, \\"Famous Bridges of the World\\" also references NYC have him born in New York in 1887. Steinman grew up in New York City, New York, and was raised in the shadows of the Brooklyn Bridge. The Williamsburg Bridge was constructed as he grew up. The late Nineteenth and early Twentieth centuries were a time of significant bridge construction in the area, and he later said this is where he got his first interest in bridges. Because his family had little money, he worked to put himself through both the City College of New York, graduating summa cum laude in 1906 and then Columbia University, where he completed three additional degrees culminating in a PhD in Civil Engineering. His PhD thesis was on a steel truss arch design for the Henry Hudson Bridge. While he was attending Columbia he did fellowships as well as taught nighttime classes at the City College and Stuyvesant Evening High School. He accepted a teaching position at the University of Idaho in Moscow, Idaho (1910‚Äì1914) but longed to return to New York. Start at bridge building Hell Gate, NYC, NY, arch, as it looked in 1917 After contacting Gustav Lindenthal about working on the Hell Gate Bridge, he returned to New York City to become a special assistant to Lindenthal, along with Othmar Ammann of Switzerland, another young bridge builder. It was said this experience of working together led to their 40-year professional rivalry. Pay was typical for the era, 200-225 USD/month. Lindenthal gave his prot√©g√©s advice about engineering such as, \\"Steinman, bridge engineering is easy. It is the financial engineering that is hard\\" (Petroski 327). While working with Lindenthal, Steinman also worked on the Sciotoville Bridge, a crossing of the Ohio River. After this work Steinman sought other employment, working as assistant engineer on the Rondout Creek Bridge, and as an assistant engineer for the New York Central Railroad. Robinson & Steinman In May 1920, Holton D. Robinson (b. 1863, Massena, NY, d. 1945, engineer of the Williamsburg Bridge) contacted Steinman and requested that they join forces to create a design for the Florian√≥polis Bridge (or Hercilio Luz Bridge, 1926) in Florian√≥polis, Brazil. After getting advice from Charles Fowler, Steinman agreed and they formed the firm of Robinson & Steinman in 1921, a partnership that lasted until the 1940s. They did not win the contract immediately but continued to collaborate on it and other projects. The early 1920s were considered a tough time for bridge construction, so Steinman tried to design his bridges to be economically pleasing rather than artistic, without sacrificing the structural integrity of the bridge. For example, Robinson and Steinman changed the original plans for the Florianopolis bridge, using eyebar chains as the upper chord of the stiffening truss instead of the conventional wire-cable. The new design produced a very stiff bridge with much less material than the original plan. Other bridge engineers would also have to take this new economical design into account when competing with Steinman. Steinman was well regarded in the profession and had a reputation for good presentations and for being politically astute. The 1920s and 1930s were a relatively busy period for Steinman. His firm was involved in many significant projects including the Hercilio Luz Bridge (or Florian√≥polis Bridge, 1926), the Carquinez Strait Bridge (1927, at the time the second largest cantilever bridge in the US), the Mount Hope Bridge and Grand M√®re Suspension Bridge (both 1929), the St. Johns Bridge and Waldo-Hancock Bridge (both 1931), the Sky Ride (1933 passenger transporter bridge at the Chicago Century of Progress exposition), the Henry Hudson Bridge (1936, particularly gratifying as this bridge realised his PhD thesis proposal), the Wellesley and Hill Islands Bridge, Wellesley Island Suspension Bridge and Georgina Island Bridge (all 1938 and part of the Thousand Islands Bridge System), the Deer Isle Bridge and the Sullivan-Hutsonville Bridge (both 1939). In addition to the many bridges that Steinman designed, he was consulted on several projects that his firm did not win. Perhaps the most famous of these bridges is \\"Galloping Gertie,\\" the original Tacoma Narrows Bridge. Steinman consulted extensively with the boosters of the bridge during the 1920s, but his design was not selected. He wrote of his frustration with the design that was chosen, and predicted a failure. He presented his findings at the 1938 meeting of the structural division of the American Society of Civil Engineers. In the audience was the designer of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge, which was under construction at the time. The failure did occur and he wrote that it had a profound impact on his design principles; he became even more conservative. It is said that he designed the Mackinac Bridge to withstand winds of 365 mph. It is considered by many to be his most significant work, although, perhaps not by Steinman himself, who expressed a personal preference for the St. Johns bridge, saying, \\"If you asked me which of the bridges I love best, I believe I would say the St. Johns bridge. I put more of myself into that bridge than any other bridge.\\" During this period Steinman became president of the American Association of Engineers and campaigned for more stringent educational and ethical standards within the profession. He also founded the National Society of Professional Engineers in 1934, serving as its first president. By the mid-1930s Steinman had a professional reputation as one of the pre-eminent bridge engineers of the US, especially for long span suspension bridges, but his bridges were eclipsed in the public eye by his old rival Ammann's George Washington Bridge (1931) and by Joseph Strauss's Golden Gate Bridge (1937) among others. His plans for a NYC cross harbor bridge (the \\"Liberty Bridge\\") came to naught with the 1940 collapse of Tacoma Narrows which cast all long suspension span proposals in doubt. Postwar work Steinman and his firm were also in charge of the major rehabilitation of the Brooklyn Bridge commencing 1948. Structurae.de has an image of Steinman jauntily perched in mid air in the cables of the bridge, perhaps one of the best known images of him. Steinman's crowning achievement, the \\"Mighty Mac\\" or Mackinac Bridge But there were still long span suspension bridges to be built. Steinman was responsible for the Kingston-Rhinecliff Bridge (1957). More importantly, development and planning of the Mackinac Bridge had been contemplated for some time, and Steinman was appointed to the board of engineers based on Michigan State Legislature legislation of 1950, stating \\"the board of engineers retained by the Mackinac Bridge Authority was to be selected and nominated by the Dean of Engineering at the University of Michigan,\\" and was soon the spokesman for the board. But his health was failing and he suffered heart attacks in 1952, the same year the legislature approved funding. He was nevertheless heavily involved in all aspects of the construction of the bridge from start to finish. From the beginnings of his work on the Mackinac Bridge, Stewart Woodfill was impressed with Steinman's ethical procedure in addressing his requests. In 1950 new legislation was produced stating \\"the board of engineers retained by the Mackinac Bridge Authority was to be selected and nominated by the Dean of Engineering at the University of Michigan\\" (Ratigan 280). This was to make sure that there was no political influence in this decision. Steinman was selected to be a member of the board. Steinman who had been trained since he was young to work well in groups was chosen as the spokesman for the board. When it comes to speaking in front of large audiences Steinman does it naturally. It was said that Steinman spoke \\"as comfortable before large audiences as he was on tall bridges\\" (Petroski 332). The stresses of the early stages of the bridge soon took their toll on Steinman. He had heart attacks in 1952, which was the same year that legislation approved the financing and construction of the bridge. Although he proposed the project of the Strait of Messina Bridge, a grandiose 1524 meter center span crossing of the Sicilian Straits of Messina, the \\"Mighty Mac,\\" completed in 1957, and at the time the longest suspended span between anchors, was his last major achievement. In 1960, he was elevated as the 16th National Honor Member of Chi Epsilon national civil engineering honor society. Steinman died in 1960. At the time of his death, he was president of the Society for the History of Technology. Tribute‚ÄîIn closing, Dr. Dunn said this about the need for a broader education for engineers, \\"If the engineer's training neglects the great human mirrors of history and languages, if his heart and mind are insensible to the great social forces, if he but feebly develops the subtle qualities of character that make for personality, his career is limited, no matter how much science he knows\\" (Ratigan 315). The Steinman engineering firm is now part of the Parsons Corporation as of 1988. Personal life and hobbies At the age of 63, Steinman took interest in poetry. Many people wrote to him saying his bridges represented poems. This inspired him to start writing. His love for bridge building was reflected in his writing, which can be seen in the titles of two of his poems, \\"The Bridge\\" and \\"I Built a Bridge\\". He received much recognition for his poetry; many poems were published in various newspapers and magazines as well as in the book \\"I Built a Bridge and Other Poems,\\" published in 1955. Steinman became involved in leadership roles in many poetry groups including the president of the Wisconsin Poetry Foundation and director of the Poetry Institute in New York.

The surviving building was designed and built by Yevgraph Tyurin in 1837‚Äì1845. The original church in the village of Yelokhovo near Moscow was built in 1722-31 for Tsarevna Praskovia Ivanovna. It was there that Alexander Pushkin was baptized in 1799. In 1790 a refectory with a four-tier belfry was built. The present structure was erected in 1837-1845 to a Neoclassical design by Yevgraph Tyurin. The architecture is typical for the late Empire style, with some elements of European eclectics. The riotous opulence of the interior decoration is due to a restoration undertaken in 1912. Upon closing the Kremlin Cathedrals (1918) and the subsequent destruction of both the Cathedral of Christ the Savior (1931) and the Dorogomilovo Cathedral (1938), the chair of Russian Orthodox Church was moved to Yelokhovo, the largest remaining open church in Moscow. The enthronements of Patriarchs Sergius I (1943), Alexius I (1945), Pimen (1970), and Alexius II (1990) took place there. The church has been well-maintained, even in the Soviet era, and is known to have a 1970 air conditioning system using deep subterranean water from a -deep artesian aquifer. The Christmas and Easter night services, which featured President Boris Yeltsin and Patriarch Alexius II, were aired on national television until the consecration of the rebuilt Cathedral of Christ the Savior in 2000. The main altar is devoted to the Epiphany and the Baptism of Jesus. The cathedral has two side-chapels: the left one of Saint Nicholas and the right one of the Annunciation. The most popular shrines of the cathedral are those that house the relics of St. Alexius of Moscow and the Kazan Icon of the Mother of God.

His lay name was Johann Ulrich Megerle. He has been described as \\"a very eccentric but popular Augustinian monk\\".Chambers Biographical Dictionary, , page 5 Biography In 1662 Abraham a Sancta Clara joined the Catholic religious order of Discalced Augustinians, and assumed the religious name by which he is known. In this order he rose step by step until he became prior provincialis and definitor of his province. Having early gained a great reputation for pulpit eloquence, he was appointed imperial court preacher at Vienna in 1669. The people flocked to hear him, attracted by the force and homeliness of his language, the grotesqueness of his humour, and the impartial severity with which he lashed the follies of all classes of society and of the court in particular. In general he spoke as a man of the people, the predominating quality of his style being an overflowing and often coarse wit. There are, however, many passages in his sermons in which he rises to loftier thought and uses more dignified language. In his published writings he displayed many of the same qualities as in the pulpit. Perhaps the most favorable specimen of his style is his didactic novel entitled Judas der Erzschelm (4 vols., Salzburg, 1686‚Äì1695). His works have been several times reproduced in whole or in part, though with many spurious interpolations. The best edition is that published in 21 vols. at Passau and Lindau (1835‚Äì1854). See Th.

She is best known as the weekend news anchor on CNN en Espa√±ol, a position she held from 2004 through 2012. She is currently both a news anchor on CM& Television in Colombia and a journalist for the Colombian magazine El Pueblo. Claudia lived in Palmira, a town near Cali, until she was 15 years old. She graduated from the Colegio del Sagrado Coraz√≥n de Jes√∫s. She then earned a degree in journalism from the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana in Bogot√°. She started her journalistic career on Noticiero del Pac√≠fico at Telepacifico, a regional TV station, where she reported on the environment for Dagma, a weekly program produced by the University of Valle's UVTV. Later, she joined the Noticiero CM& newscast, where she covered a variety of important events including several official presidential trips, union marches, student protests, and congressional sessions. In 1998, she joined Caracol Noticias as a morning news anchor. She also covered international and health issues for Caracol Noticias. Her reporting on women's health issues led to an award in Mexico by CELSAM (Centro de Estudios Latinoamericanos para la Salud de la Mujer or the Center of Latin American Studies on Women's Health). In addition, she served as a communications consultant for various local businesses, such as the Colombian Society of Pediatrics, Roche Laboratories, Coca-Cola, ExxonMobil, and Unisys. In 2004, she was named one of five Colombian women of the year by Fucsia magazine. On July 30, 2004, after a job offer made via email, she joined CNN en Espa√±ol as the anchor of the weekend news program Mirador Mundial. She has since covered numerous important stories for CNN en Espa√±ol, including the U.S. elections, the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami aftermath, and the death of Pope John Paul II, and has interviewed the president of Bolivia, Evo Morales, and one of his predecessors, Carlos Mesa.

It may be used only when plaintiff owns the thing, and the defendant is somehow impeding the plaintiff's possession of the thing. The term originated in ancient Rome. The plaintiff could also institute an actio furti (a personal action) to punish the defendant. If the thing could not be recovered, the plaintiff could claim damages from the defendant with the aid of the condictio furtiva (a personal action). With the aid of the actio legis Aquiliae (a personal action), the plaintiff could claim damages from the defendant. Rei vindicatio was derived from the ius civile, and therefore was available only to Roman citizens. Specification of the thing The function of rei vindicatio remains the same in most modern legal systems as it was in ancient Rome. However, Roman law was much more particular about the specification of the \\"thing\\". A plaintiff could not have won a case without specifying the thing in question. At a theoretical level, Roman jurists identified three kinds of \\"thing\\": * Corpus unitum * Corpus coniunctum * Corpus ex distantibus was not a single thing, but a bundle of independent things, such as a herd of cattle. Cattle were so important in Roman society that Roman jurists developed the regulation on cattle on a full scale. Corpus ex distantibus was the most disputed of the three. Greek influence on Roman legal thought Two law schools in Rome, the Sabinian school and the Proculian school, remained influential from the late Republic throughout the classical period. Most modern Romanists consider these schools to be influenced to some extent by Greek philosophy. They say that the Sabinian school was the student of Stoicism, while the Proculian school followed Aristotle or Peripateticism. Greek influence is especially evident in classical Roman thinking on accession and specification. Sabinians, following Stoicism, argued that in these areas hyle ‚Äòsubstance‚Äô supersedes eidos ‚Äòform‚Äô. Proculians countered that eidos is the decisive factor for a fate of a thing.

The railroad ran from Somerset Junction on the Belvidere Delaware Rail Road via Pennington and Hopewell to Millstone. A connection to the Millstone and New Brunswick Railroad for a through route to New Brunswick was planned but never built as the Mercer & Somerset Railway lost its battle with the Delaware and Bound Brook Railroad. Thus, it was bankrupt, defunct and dismantled by 1880. A stone pillar in the middle of the Millstone River just south of Amwell Road still remains today, built as part of the infrastructure to carry the tracks across the river. Hopewell was the site of a frog war with the National Railway. A plan existed at one time to extend the Philadelphia, Newtown and New York Railroad, another railroad being built to block the National Railway, to cross the Delaware River and connect with the M&S.; History The railroad was chartered on March 17, 1870 by the United New Jersey Railroad and Canal Companies for the sole purpose of tying up the construction of the National Railway. In 1873, the M&S; had plans to straighten out the line as part of a new through railroad operated by the PRR. No straightening was done, but it did become PRR-operated. The railroad was formally opened on February 6, 1874, with an excursion train from Millstone to Trenton. At the beginning, it was leased by the United New Jersey Railroad and Canal Company and operated by the Belvidere Delaware Rail Road. By mid-1875, the railroad was being operated by the PRR as their Mercer and Somerset Branch, part of a through route from New York. The M&S; served as one of several legal challenges to the National Railway line from Philadelphia to New York. Others were the Philadelphia, Newtown and New York Railroad in Pennsylvania and a fight over whether they had the right to cross the Delaware River. The New Jersey-side one resulted in a frog war at Hopewell in early 1876. The National Railway won the battle, and the Delaware and Bound Brook Railroad formally opened on April 27, 1876. The M&S; was sold under bankruptcy to the Pennsylvania Railroad on November 28, 1879. It was soon dismantled, since it no longer served its purpose to block the National Railway. The abandoned grade of the west end of the line became Jacobs Creek Road.

It is one of the most visited touristic highlights in the country. The museum receives around 500,000 tourists per year. Los 75 del Museo del Oro - Semana The museum displays a selection of pre-Columbian gold and other metal alloys, such as Tumbaga, and contains the largest collection of gold artifacts in the world in its exhibition rooms on the second and third floors. Together with pottery, stone, shell, wood and textile objects, these items, made of a‚Äì to indigenous cultures ‚Äì sacred metal, testify to the life and thought of the different societies which lived in present-day Colombia before the Spanish conquest of the Americas.  History  In 1934, the Bank of the Republic began helping to protect the archaeological patrimony of Colombia. The object known as Poporo Quimbaya was the first one in a collection. It has been on exhibition for 70 years. The Museum is today administered by Banrepcultural. The museum houses the famous Muisca golden raft found in Pasca in 1969, that represents the ceremony of the new zipa (ruler) of Bacat√°, the basis for the El Dorado myth. The heir to the chieftaincy assumed power with a great offering to the gods. In this representation he is seen standing at the centre of a raft, surrounded by the principal chieftains, all of them adorned with gold and feathers. After a decade of work, the museum was expanded and renovated in October 2008. With the renovation, the museum organized the permanent exhibition in five rooms with archaeological objects and an interactive room. It also added an auditorium, some temporary exhibitions rooms, a cafe, a restaurant, and a souvenir store.  Description  The museum has a collection of 55,000 pieces, 6,000 of which are on display in their expanded building. There are bilingual descriptions of almost all exhibits. On the first floor houses the museum's main entrance, a shop, and a restaurant. Exhibitions begin on the second floor. The main room is called \\"People and Gold in pre-Hispanic Colombia\\". In glass vitrines display goldsmiths' work from the different cultures which inhabited Colombia before the Spanish colonists arrived. The permanent exhibition is divided into different halls for every culture: Calima, Quimbaya, Muisca, Zen√∫, Tierradentro, San Agust√≠n, Tolima, Tairona, and Urab√°, and a special room called \\"After Columbus\\" (Despu√©s de Col√≥n). The exposition continues on the third floor, with \\"The Flying Chamanic\\" and \\"The Offering.\\" The first shows the process of a shamanic ceremony with its different gold pieces, the second is divided into three parts: the \\"Offering Room\\", the \\"Offering Boat\\", and the \\"Lake\\". At the end of the exposition, there is a \\"Profunditation Room\\" with artistic videos about the most important gold pieces of the museum.

The term was also used for various schools and courses established during the campaign. Nowadays this term is sometimes used in Russian as a slang for answers on common questions.  Background  In 1897, the overall literacy rate of the Russian Empire was an estimated 24%, with the rural literacy rate at 19.7%. There were few schools available to the population, particularly in rural areas. Until the early 20th century, there were still no specific curricular plans or guidelines in the zemstvo schools. In 1891, the literacy schools came under church administration, and maintained a largely religious curriculum, which emphasized the teaching of old Church Slavonic. The peasantry was largely self-educated, and often relied on schools run by political dissidents for the latter period of tsarist rule. Facing a growing opposition from the general populace, Tsar Alexander II announced a decree that would raise the tuition fee for schools, thus preventing further social mobility for serfs who were allowed free mobility. During the reign of Tsar Nicholas II (1894‚Äì1917) liberals pushed for a universal education system, which scholars predict may have expanded if it were not for World War I.  The Bolshevik literacy campaign  The population learned to read and write. Cheboksary, 1930s. CASSR), 1930s. When the Bolshevik Party came to power in 1917, they faced a crumbling empire infamous for its perceived backwardness and poor education system. In 1917, within the remaining Tsarist territories, an estimated 37.9% of the male population above seven years old was literate and only 12.5% of the female population was literate. Lenin's views on literacy were rooted in its economic and political benefits. \\"Without literacy,\\" he declared, \\"There can be no politics, there can only be rumors, gossip and prejudice.\\" The Likbez campaign was started on December 26, 1919, when Vladimir Lenin signed the Decree of the Soviet government \\"On eradication of illiteracy among the population of RSFSR\\" (\\"–û –ª–∏–∫–≤–∏–¥–∞—Ü–∏–∏ –±–µ–∑–≥—Ä–∞–º–æ—Ç–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ —Å—Ä–µ–¥–∏ –Ω–∞—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è –†–°–§–°–†\\"). According to this decree, all people from 8 to 50 years old were required to become literate in their native language. 40,000 liquidation points (–ª–∏–∫–ø—É–Ω–∫—Ç—ã) were arranged to serve as centers for education, and achieving literacy. Fighting for time and funding during the ensuing Russian Civil War of 1917‚Äì23, Narkompros, the Soviet Ministry of Education, quickly assembled the Cheka Likbez (an acronym for the \\"Extraordinary Commission for the Liquidation of Illiteracy\\") which was to be responsible for the training of literacy teachers as well as organizing and propagating the literacy campaign. From the peasantry to trade unions, specific literacy percentage quotas were made for different sectors of Soviet society. For example, the trade union campaign aimed for 100% literacy for its workers by 1923. The Bolsheviks also believed that through literary campaigns they could easily promote Party ideology and shape the population's outlook. Women, given their low literacy rate, were regarded as having the highest potential for becoming the \\"modernizers\\" of Soviet society. Through the education of peasant women, the Bolsheviks hoped to break down the patriarchal domination of rural society. Lenin had written in The Emancipation of Women that a woman's illiteracy would impair the \\"fighting spirit\\" of male party members and prevent wives from grasping their husbands' ideals. In the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic, the women's literacy campaign was largely carried out by members of the Ali Bayramov Club, a women's organization founded by Azeri Bolshevik women in Baku in 1920.Heyat, F. 2002. Azeri women in transition. London: Routledge. 89-94. To further extend their reach to the peasant community, the Bolsheviks built reading rooms in villages across the country. Serving as a propaganda center rather than library, a literate peasant would act as the room's \\"Red Reader\\" and lead discussions on texts sent by the Party directive with members of the local community. Attendance was most often mandatory, as the reading rooms proved to be one of the Party's most successful propaganda tools, where campaigns would take shape and the locals would hear about happenings in the outside world. By 1923, however, it was clear that the campaign had its shortcomings. For one thing, Narkompros was having difficulty competing for funding from the Politburo. The Narkompros budget for literacy education dropped from 2.8% in 1924-5 to 1.6% in 1927‚Äì8. Likbez literary schools were not established locally by order of Party elites‚Äîinstead, they relied heavily on grassroots demand. Narkompros also found it hard to find educated teachers actually willing to live in the isolated conditions of the countryside. In many cases, peasant and proletariat students met their educators and literacy teachers with hostility due to their \\"petty bourgeois\\" backgrounds. To solve this problem, local governments established a system of rewards for workers who attended class, granting special privileges to those who did. In some extreme cases, during the 1922 famine, many districts required their illiterate male and female populations to attend literacy school in order to earn their food points. Fearing they were not reaching out to the population and making the popular reading frenzy that they had hoped, the Politburo decided to heavily fund and promote clubs and societies such as the \\"Down with Illiteracy\\" society.  History  = Early spread = Early Likbez-era schoolhouse scene invoking the help of God. Pro-literacy propaganda came into popular Soviet culture with the government's policy of likbez rooted in the Bolshevik push for mass literacy directly following the Bolshevik rise to power. After the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, Anatoly Lunachersky, the Soviet People's Commissariat for Education made a conscious effort to introduce political propaganda into Soviet schools, particularly the labour schools that had been established in 1918 with the Statutniihge of the Uniform Labour School decree. These propaganda pamphlets, required texts, and posters artistically embodied the core values of the Soviet push for literacy in both rural and urban settings, namely the concept espoused by Lenin that \\"Without literacy, there can be no politics, there can only be rumors, gossip and prejudice.\\" This concept, the Soviet valuing of literacy, was later echoed in works like Trotsky's 1924 Literature and Revolution, in which Trotsky describes literature and reading as driving forces in the forging of a new Communist man. In the early years of the Likbez campaign, the State compulsarily enrolled millions of illiterate Soviets from both town and country in literacy schools, requiring these citizens to engage with the Leninist ideology of pro-literacy. In this period, Komsomol members and Young Pioneer detachments were also commissioned to spread pro-literacy propaganda in the form of pamphlets and word of mouth to village illiterates. Initial pro-literacy propaganda efforts included instituting spaces in villages, particularly, that would facilitate the spread of literacy through the countryside. For example, in the early 1920s, Bolsheviks built \\"Red Rooms,\\" reading rooms in villages across Russia, to serve as propaganda centers by which texts sent by the Party were disseminated to local communities. In children's education, particularly, inoculation of illiteracy was presented by the State as a means by which children could most fully develop desirable qualities such as curiosity and patience. For children, the most widely used books in the early Likbez campaign to promote literacy were the Bible, Kniga Svyashchennogo Chtenia (Book of Holy Reading), Detsky Mir (Children's World) and Rodnoe Slovo (Native Word) by Konstantin D. Ushinsky. God and divine will were a common pro-literacy motif in propaganda throughout the Likbez campaign, but were especially present in its pre-1920 phase. = 1920-1930 = 1924 advertisement by Varvara Stepanova for \\"Night of the Books\\" In the early 1920s, the Bolshevik government emphasized local initiatives and de-emphasized centralized State control to parallel Lenin's New Economic Policy that had been instituted in 1921. It was in this atmosphere that the Soviet government's Commissariat of Enlightenment most heavily launched its methodical literacy campaign by the Spring of 1923. The height of the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic's (RSFR) People's Commissariat of Enlightenment (Narkompros) literacy campaign lasted until the tenth anniversary of the October Revolution, 7 November 1927. From 1923-1927, Soviet pro-literacy propaganda became especially pushed by the Cheka's likbez agencies among Russian Trade Unions. In the pro-literacy propaganda campaigns within trade Unions, the Party-line contained in pamphlets and other pieces of propaganda focused on \\"true literacy\\" as the ideal literacy level for workers, a commitment that would require 6‚Äì8 months of additional enrollment in Union- sponsored literacy schools after a worker had initially achieved \\"semi literacy.\\" In the mid-1920s, Cheka likbez commissions would routinely seek and publish reports of literacy rates from Unions as a means of spreading a competitive desire for literacy between towns and factories. In these reports, illiteracy was painted as a \\"weak opponent\\" to be overcome in a short period of time by reading State literature in libraries and \\"Red Rooms\\" or red corners. The Russian Transport Union, with its educational administration's 40-50 million ruble annual spending capacity, was largely in charge of seeing to the promulgation of literacy initiatives, transmission of pro-literacy pamphlets, and dissemination of books and reading materials to Union-sponsored schools. Throughout the 1920s, spreading literacy in the Soviet transportation sector through the building of Union schools held symbolic importance for the State as a means of propaganda in and of itself. By promoting literacy in transport workers, specifically, the Komsomol and Cheka likbez units hoped to achieve symbolic victories in signaling the Likbez campaign's overall success. Even in the early Likbez campaign, the transportation sector already experienced relatively low illiteracy rates in workers due to the reading necessary to operate modes of transportation. As such, achieving high literacy in this population was a relatively easy goal and would show the Likbez campaign's success in a widespread and visible industry. State-sponsored prescriptive materials in the 1920s concerning the plight of the domestic worker had a specific focus on literacy stemming from Union membership. These short stories, chastushki, poems, cartoons, and plays were spread through pamphlets, journals, and wall newspapers and were usually tales about young, single, illiterate women from the countryside. In these pieces of propaganda, it was when the downtrodden women became acquainted with local Soviet officials that the women's luck began to change. In the plot lines of most of these works, the main characters, who had usually fled their countryside homes after being taken advantage of sexually, experienced reversals of fortunes after meeting Soviet officials in their new, urban homes. These officials would rescue the women from the abuses they were suffering as ill-paid and ill-respected domestic servants by encouraging the women to join a Union. At this point in the story, the women would receive not only Union protection but also an education as a result of Union membership and access to Union schools and reading materials. Ultimately, the story's heroine, the domestic worker, would become fully literate as well as active in her local worker's committee (mestkom). Often, the women in these works of pro-literacy propaganda were portrayed as using their new literacy and subsequent heightened foothold in Union society to become Soviet delegates themselves and help second generations of downtrodden women by teaching them to read and write. In these rags to riches propaganda tales, literacy was the vehicle by which women were able to lift up their status as workers within Unions and Soviet society. 1925 propaganda poster: \\"If You Don't Read Books, You'll Soon Forget How to Read and Write\\"In 1924, 90% of domestic workers coming from villages were illiterate and were referred to in Soviet literature and propaganda as the \\"third front,\\" a subset of the population which needed to be raised up through literacy. The focus on spreading the desire for literacy among trade unions through pamphlets, building of schools, and the dissemination of state- approved literature largely petered out by 1925 when Cheka likbez realized it could not achieve its high literary goals by 1933, the date of the Narkompros deadline for compulsory secondary education throughout the Soviet Union. After 1925, greater flexibility in literacy class structures and attendance within Soviet trade unions was gradually introduced. In the mid-1920s, posters had become a \\"quintessential form of propaganda\\" in Likbez. Throughout the 1920s, though pro-literacy propaganda was still taking on its earlier forms, it was increasingly contained in propaganda posters. = 1930-1936 = As Stalin consolidated his power through the late 1920s, Soviet propaganda largely shifted its focus to center on rapid industrialization and centralized, State control of the economy. By the 1930s, the dissemination of pro-literacy propaganda had slowed throughout the Soviet Union. The bodies for promoting literacy whose establishment Likbez had catalyzed throughout the Soviet Union remained in place, but the push for pro-literacy propaganda was not occurring with the same fervor as it had in the previous decade. Indeed, throughout the 1930s, propaganda became increasingly focused on glorifying the Soviet State, particularly its leader Joseph Stalin.  Pro-literacy posters  1925 propaganda poster: \\"Peasant woman, consolidate the unity of workers and peasants.\\"Pro-literacy propaganda posters were a cheap way for the State Publishing House in Leningrad and other Soviet State bodies to reach a wide audience. Moreover, posters could be understood even by illiterate citizens. Propaganda posters had been an important weapon for the Bolsheviks during the Civil War 1918-1921, but they remained in use even after the war's conclusion. After the Civil War and Lenin's institution of the NEP Policy, propaganda posters began increasingly depicting the reforging of Soviet everyday life or byt. Propaganda posters of the 1920s focused on the need to build a new world and way of life after the destruction of the Civil War. While the Bolsheviks were experienced in the use of print media to spread ideas, they recognized that print media could not work to imprint Soviet ideology on the USSR as a whole, since most Soviets were illiterate and could not even understand Soviet staple texts such as those of Marx or Lenin. Due to the prevalence of religion in mass Russian pre-revolutionary culture, Soviet citizens were used to looking at religious icons and learning from the images and symbolism that they saw. Much like the Orthodox Church had done with icons, the Soviet State used propaganda posters to \\"present symbols in a simple and easily identifiable way, even to barely literate peasants\\". Pro-literacy propaganda posters sold Communist ideology to the population by portraying the benefits of literacy to individuals, specifically. In the early years of the Soviet Union, particularly in the early-mid 1920s, propaganda posters were used to spread literacy while at the same time indoctrinating the masses in Marxist‚ÄìLeninist thought.  Women and pro-literacy propaganda  Women, particularly, became motifs in Soviet pro-literacy propaganda. In pro-literacy propaganda, the Bolshevik commitment to female literacy was used to underscore the party's commitment to improving women's station in Soviet society. Zhenotdel, the Russian Soviet Party's women's section, was a particular force in disseminating pro-literacy pamphlets and posters during the height of the Likbez campaign. The use of women as main characters was a key element of Likbez-era propaganda literature. The plot line of women improving their stations in Soviet society through literacy was first introduced in the widely disseminated rags-to-riches tales of domestic workers in the early 1920s. For example, on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the Russian decree on literacy (December 1924), the State commissioning body of Ivanovo-Voznesensk (the guberniia) published a pamphlet which linked women's lag in reaching full equality to their husbands with women's ignorance and illiteracy. By achieving literacy, the pamphlet's main character Riabnkova is able to gain autonomy and escape the clutches of her overbearing husband to become a contributing member of Soviet society. Moreover, images of women became central to Soviet pro- literacy propaganda posters during the Likbez campaign. In these posters, women were shown distributing books, teaching children how to read, and generally engaging with the Soviet ideals of education and literacy. Prior to 1920, women's representation in political posters was mostly allegorical. It was not until 1920 that Soviet artists generated a female counterpart for the commonly-used imagery of the male worker or blacksmith that had come into widespread use in post-Civil War propaganda. After 1920, the imagery of women in propaganda posters began to shift to that of the woman worker, a new Soviet woman. Though some allegorical representations of women subsisted in propaganda posters and art through the early 1920s, the new depictions of women found in Likbez-era posters were of women in plain dress, \\"industrious women workers and peasant women, building socialism alongside their male counterparts.\\" Throughout the Likbez campaign, the building of socialism in which women were depicted as taking part was the spread of literacy. Though representation of the woman worker waned in its prevalence in political propaganda during the NEP-era, the representation of women and books remained a mainstay in pro-literacy Likbez-era propaganda through the 1920s and into the 1930s. Women, given their low literacy rate, were regarded by the State as having the highest potential for becoming the \\"modernizers\\" of Soviet society. Reports of success in the education and literacy of women, the largest demographic group in the illiterate segment of Soviet society, were used as propaganda in reports by the Soviet State as symbols of the State's power to improve the lot of even the most vulnerable and needy of its society.  Results  With the October 1917 Revolution, governmental standards regarding what was considered \\"literate\\" also changed. Although all army personnel in the tsarist period eligible for conscription were required to be functionally literate, most men who could simply read the alphabet and their own name were deemed as fully literate. Although census takers were given rather strict orders on what was deemed fully literate and even semi-literate, in remote provinces and parts of Central Asia standards were somewhat laxer than in locations with a closer proximity to Moscow. The campaign was not the success the Bolsheviks had originally envisioned mainly because it lacked teacher volunteers, funding, and organization. The likbez campaign was most effective for people between the ages of 9 and 35. For anyone over 35, the Bolsheviks believed they were utterly unreachable. In 1926, however, only 51% of the population over the age of 10 had achieved literacy. Male literacy was at 66.5 while female literacy lagged behind at 37.2. By 1939, however, male literacy was at 90.8 and female literacy had increased to 72.5%. According to the 1939 Soviet Census, literate people were 89.7% (RSFSR, ages 9‚Äì49). During the 1950s, the Soviet Union had become a country of nearly 100% literacy. There is speculation that had the peasant tradition of self-education been able to continue, the peasantry may have reached the level of education that it did by the mid-1930s, independent of government efforts.  Campaign for non-Russian speakers  In non-Russian speaking areas of the Soviet population, Narkompros promoted the policy of Korenizatsiya (literally \\"putting down the roots\\") within the separate autonomous regions and republics to the extent that teaching Russian was considered a counter-revolutionary crime. For the separate nationalities, the ABCD Hierarchy, a system which ranked the 120 languages of the Soviet Union according their communicable significance, charted out a specific plan for each nationality's achievement of literacy. In 1924 textbooks were printed in only 25 languages of the Soviet Union. However, by 1934 they were printed in 104 languages.

It is served by Sydney Trains T3 Bankstown, T4 Illawarra and T8 South services. It was designed by the New South Wales Government Railways and built from 1884 to 1962, with William Robinson having built the original 1884 buildings. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. History Sydenham Railway Station was built on a duplicated line from Illawarra Junction to Hurstville and opened as Marrickville railway station on 15 October 1884. The western platform contained a major 3rd class brick station building having a detached toilet block at each end separated by walled courtyards while the eastern platform contained a large 2nd class brick station building. The station obtained its present name on 19 January 1895 with the opening of the Belmore branch line. In 1896, Sydenham became a junction station with the opening of the Bankstown line with the current platforms 3 and 4 opened.\\"Station Information N to Z\\" JH Forsyth State Rail Authority 1997 The impressive station was obviously intended to serve the Marrickville township proper but it was distant, surrounded by industrial and rural estates and only grew as a station by reason of the need to cope with the branch line junction. In 1907 the line from Edgeware Road to Sydenham was quadruplicated to serve the Belmore to Bankstown extension when it opened in 1909. This resulted in confining both buildings on island platforms so that passengers had to reach the platforms by an extended footbridge, whereas the substantial platform building on the current platform 2/3 island previously faced the street. A new timber overhead booking office on a steel support frame was built between Platforms 3 and 4 and steel footbridges were eventually extended to all platforms 1914. To provide for the proposed Eastern Suburbs railway line, two additional tracks were put in so that in 1925 the brick standard island platform building on Platform 6 was built. In 1926 the lines were electrified at Sydenham. Soon after, in 1927 the refreshment room was opened for factory workers in the area. As the additional tracks were never utilised for the Eastern Suburbs Railway they have been mainly used for the Bankstown line trains. In 1963 a brick parcels office building was constructed on Platform 1 but closed in the late 1980s. It had been intended that the tracks on platforms 1 and 2 would extend along the alignment to Erskineville as an adjunct to the Eastern Suburbs railway.Sydenham Railway Station Group NSW Environment & Heritage This plan was never completed, although partial platforms were erected at St Peters and Erskineville in preparation. Because of this, Bankstown line trains continue to run on the same tracks as East Hills services, and the result of the additional platforms is that the Bankstown line's junction with the Illawarra line has been merely moved from the south of Sydenham station to the north.Lunch Club Notes Australian Railway Historical Society The weatherboard ticket office on the overhead footbridge burnt down in the mid 1980s. In the late 1980s a new brick overhead booking office and a new metal-clad shop were built on the existing 1914 footbridge structure, and new canopies built over the stairs and connected to platform buildings. Sydenham station now has side platforms at both the eastern and western extremities of the station (platforms 1 and 6 respectively) and two island platforms for the four inner tracks. Platforms 1 and 2 serve the Bankstown Line and Platforms 5 and 6 serve the Eastern Suburbs & Illawarra Line. Prior to the opening of the Airport line in May 2000, all East Hills line services operated via platforms 3 and 4. Most East Hills trains now run via the Airport line, although some peak hour services continue to travel via Sydenham using these platforms. A new concourse including four lifts and new stairs to access the platforms opened in February 2013, replacing the previous concourse and footbridge.Improved public transport facilities for Sydenham commuters Transport for NSW The upgrade also included new ticketing facilities, a new family accessible toilet and staff facilities.CityRail Update Bankstown and Inner West Edition August 2011 Immediately south of the station, the Metropolitan Goods Line to Port Botany crosses via a pratt truss bridge that opened in 1925, while beyond lies the XPT Service Centre.Sydenham (Illawarra Line) Underbridge NSW Environment & Heritage As part of the Sydney Metro City & Southwest project, the station will be upgraded with a new concourse on the northern end of the station, and platforms 1 and 2 upgraded and converted into use for the Sydney Metro.

This building is separated from and to the southeast of the brick 1962 parcels office on the platform. ;Platform 1 parcels office (1962) Located at the north-western end of the platform, this is a plain dark brick building with parapets to 3 sides and a cantilevered awning on steel brackets with a timber tongue & grooved ceiling (similar to the Platform 4 awning), on the platform side. On the north-eastern (Railway Parade) elevation, this building has a gabled parapet at its north-western end. ;Platform 2/3 platform building (1884) The Platform 2/3 building is a single storey painted brick building with a gabled roof form with gable ends at each end with rectangular timber louvred vents. At the eastern end, there is a separate men's toilet building, a small square painted brick building with a hipped corrugated steel roof and 3 timber framed double hung windows on each side. This is connected to the main platform building via a recently roofed courtyard with painted brick walls both sides and a moulded stucco capping course and central curved section. There are metal double doors to one side of the courtyard. The platform building has timber framed double hung windows, some plain, some with single horizontal glazing bars to each sash. The building has timber panelled double doors with large arched timber framed fanlights above. The south awning to the platform building has a corrugated steel skillion roof, cast iron brackets and posts with very elaborate stucco wall brackets. The north awning has a timber tongue & grooved board ceiling and is clearly more recent, with modern steel posts and framing. The interior of the main section of the platform building is divided into rooms. The current Station Master's office (which appears to have been a former waiting area) has a decorative pressed metal ceiling and cornices, a modern tiled floor, a notable marble mantelpiece to the chimney breast. The current waiting area to this building has a timber battened plaster ceiling, a chimney breast and moulded plaster chair rail, plastered walls to 3 sides, a timber tongue & grooved board wall to the 4th side. The fanlight to the waiting area has two vertical timber glazing bars. The building is remarkably intact, including an extant marble mantelpiece, considered very rare (only other example of an extant mantelpiece in a platform building on the Illawarra Line is at St. Peters). ;Platform 4/5 platform building (1884) A painted brick single storey building with a hipped roof form with two prominent transverse gables, timber barge boards and finials to gable ends. There are no extant chimneys and roofing is corrugated steel. The building features timber framed double hung windows with moulded stucco heads and sills. There is a lower gable roofed section at the western end of the platform building, which appears to be an extension. At the eastern end of the building is a separate former toilets building with a hipped roof and transverse gablets at the peak of the roof. This is connected to the main section of the platform building by a now roofed brick walled courtyard. The Platform 4 (north) awning is on cast iron posts with decorative cast iron brackets and framing, with a corrugated steel skillion roof. The Platform 5 (south) awning is a skillion corrugated steel roofed awning cantilevered on steel posts and brackets, which does not extend the full length of the main section of the platform building. The waiting area to this building has a ripple iron ceiling with moulded timber cornice and one metal ceiling rose, a chimney breast, and timber floor. The former female toilets have a plaster ceiling with a damaged plaster ceiling rose. The modern toilet building is separate. ;Platform 6 building (1925) This is located at the far north-western end of the platform. This is a gabled brick platform building with a corrugated steel roof. Most windows are altered, however original windows are timber framed double hung with 9-paned top sashes. There is a 6-paned fanlight to one door. Mostly modern timber flush doors. The building includes a skillion awning cantilevered on steel brackets mounted on stucco wall brackets. ;Overhead concourse (2013) Concrete and glass structure providing entry from Gleeson Avenue. ;Platform canopies ( late 1980s) Modern canopies extend from the overhead concourse, over the stairs, connecting to the platform buildings on all platforms. The canopy to Platform 6 is very long due to the location of the Platform 6 building. These canopies have gabled corrugated steel roofing and steel supports with curved brackets. ;Gleeson Avenue overbridge ( 1920s) Brick bridge with brick balustrades. Balustrades are painted with advertising facing Gleeson Avenue. ;Brick perimeter walls (1925) Dark face brick walls partially defining the station perimeters, extending from Gleeson Avenue some metres along Burrows Avenue on the south and part of the station perimeter in Railway Parade on the north. The Burrows Avenue wall tapers up in height towards Gleeson Avenue. The Railway Parade wall has a flat top and part forms the wall of the 1925 waiting shed on Platform 1. Both walls have a bullnose brick capping course. ;Platforms Two side platforms; (Platforms 1 and 6) and 2 island platforms (Platforms 2/3 and 4/5).

Heritage listing  Sydenham Railway Station - inclusive of all platform buildings and awnings, parcels office, waiting shed, brick faced platforms, Gleeson Avenue overbridge and brick perimeter walls - is of State heritage significance. Sydenham Railway Station is of historical significance as a major junction station developed from 1884 to the present, with two 1884 platform buildings, 1925 platform building and waiting shed, 1962 parcels office, and 1920s Gleeson Avenue overbridge demonstrating its development over time, including the adaptation of the 1884 wayside platform buildings for island platform use. Of aesthetic and historical significance, the platform building awnings demonstrate the range of awnings used on railway buildings from the small original awning of two bays on the Platform 2/3 building (the original minor platform) to the addition of cantilevered awnings in 1925. All platform buildings are of aesthetic significance as good representative examples of their types and periods. The 1914 footbridge structure and stairs were of aesthetic and historical associational significance as a representative haunched beam structure and stair manufactured by Dorman Long & Co. engineers. The surviving interior and exterior detailing of the 1884 platform buildings and awnings is considered rare on the Illawarra line, with other examples at St. Peters, Tempe and Rockdale. Sydenham railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.

The place has the potential to contribute to the local community's sense of place, and can provide a connection to the local community's past. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The station as a whole is rare, retaining structures from the first period of construction of the Illawarra line up to the 1960s. The Platform 2/3 building at Sydenham is rare, as only five stations on the Illawarra line retain an 1880s 3rd Class platform building (other examples at Carlton, Rockdale, St. Peters, and Wollongong). The 2nd class brick Platform 4/5 building at Sydenham is rare, as only three stations on the Illawarra line retain platform buildings of this type and period (other examples at Arncliffe and Tempe). The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The platform buildings, awnings, footbridge, stairs, and overbridge are representative of railway structure designs over time from 1884 to 1962.

It is served by Sydney Trains T4 line services. It was originally built in 1884. The 1884 buildings were designed by the New South Wales Government Railways and built by C. Mayes; the 1918 footbridge was manufactured by Dorman Long. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. History Tempe station opened on 15 October 1884 on the same date as of the Illawarra line from Redfern to Hurstville with two side platforms. It was referred to during the planning stages as Cooks River railway station, but opened under the Tempe name. It was built as a double-track station (as at Sydenham) to service what was planned to be a large residential area; however, development of the area was much slower than originally envisioned. Unlike Sydenham, Tempe had a small goods siding immediately eastward of the station in 1890. The original buildings included brick second class platform buildings on two brick-faced platforms and a brick Station Master's residence (all of which are still extant) as well as a brick Gatekeeper's cottage (since demolished). The former Tempe Station Master's residence is to the east adjacent to Platform 4, but now in private ownership. The steel overhead footbridge was built in 1918, with steel stairs to the platforms, just prior to the quadruplification of the line in 1919. The lines through Tempe were quadruplicated in 1919, with the western platform converted to an island platform and a new side platform built.Station Information N to Z State Rail Authority 1998Tempe Station NSWrail.netTempe Railway Station Group NSW Environment & Heritage In 1926 the line was electrified as far as Oatley. Since 1943, the Platform 4 building (presumably 1919) has been demolished and replaced with a modern platform canopy. 1993 the overhead booking office was reclad and reroofed. Prior the opening of Wolli Creek station and the Airport line in May 2000, Tempe was the junction between the East Hills and Illawarra lines, and local East Hills services stopped at the station utilising Platforms 1 and 2. Most of the East Hills line services now run via the Airport line and those peak hour services running via Sydenham do not stop at Tempe. To the north of the station lies the junction with the Metropolitan Goods line and the XPT Service Centre. Platforms & services  Description  Tempe Railway Station is located along Griffiths Street to the east and Richardsons Crescent and Mackey Park to the west.

Tempe Railway Station is of historical significance for its two rare 1884 platform buildings dating from the first period of construction of the Illawarra railway line, along with the 1918 overhead footbridge structure and stairs, and original 1918 overhead booking office. The 1884 platform buildings have historical association with railways designer C. Mayes. Tempe Railway Station is of aesthetic significance for its two 1884 platform buildings which are fine intact examples of vernacular railway platform buildings of the late Victorian period demonstrating Victorian Rustic Gothic style design influences, rare for their high level of integrity. The 1918 Dorman Long & Co. steel footbridge and stairs are of aesthetic significance and historical associational significance as an intact representative footbridge structure by this firm, rare for its high level of integrity. The steel footbridge and stairs at Tempe Railway Station are also of aesthetic significance as a landmark structure within the relatively visually isolated setting of the station. Tempe Railway Station is of aesthetic significance generally for its setting, with open space to the west, the Cooks River to the south, and a densely built up residential area to the east. The two 2nd class brick platform buildings are rare as Tempe is one of only 3 stations on the Illawarra line retaining platform buildings of this period and type (the others being Arncliffe and Sydenham), and the only station with two extant largely intact buildings of this period. The original 1918 overhead booking office is now considered rare (despite recladding). Tempe railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.

He was named Minister of Renewable Resources and Transportation Services on October 15, 1975, and held this position until the Schreyer government was defeated in the election of 1977. Bostrom himself was re-elected in the 1977 election, with a reduced majority. In 1979, he supported Howard Pawley's successful bid to succeed Schreyer as party leader. Bostrom did not seek re-election in the 1981 election.

The bestselling novel was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1963. Faulkner previously won this award for his book A Fable, making him one of only four authors to be awarded it more than once. Unlike many of his earlier works, it is a straightforward narration and eschews the complicated literary techniques of his more well known works. It is a picaresque novel, and as such may seem uncharacteristically lighthearted given its subject matter. For these reasons, The Reivers is often ignored by Faulkner scholars or dismissed as a lesser work. He previously had referred to writing a \\"Golden Book of Yoknapatawpha County\\" with which he would finish his literary career. It is likely that The Reivers was meant to be this \\"Golden Book\\". The Reivers was adapted into a film of the same name directed by Mark Rydell and starring Steve McQueen as Boon Hogganbeck. Plot The basic plot of The Reivers takes place in the first decade of the 20th century. It involves a young boy named Lucius Priest (a distant cousin of the McCaslin/Edmonds family Faulkner wrote about in Go Down, Moses) who accompanies a family friend, employee and proteg√© named Boon Hogganbeck to Memphis, where Boon hopes to woo into marriage a prostitute called \\"Miss Corrie\\", of whom he is a client when he can afford it. Since Boon has no way to get to Memphis, he steals (reives, thereby becoming a reiver) Lucius's grandfather's car, the first car in Yoknapatawpha County. They discover that Ned McCaslin, a black man who works with Boon at Lucius's grandfather's horse stables, has stowed away with them (Ned is also a blood cousin of the Priests). When they reach Memphis, Boon and Lucius stay in the brothel where Miss Corrie lives and works, while Ned disappears into the black part of town. Soon Ned returns, having traded the car for a racehorse. The brothel life is turned upside down with their coming to stay, at the same time as Miss Corrie's nephew that has come there to get some finesse. The brothel is run by Miss Reba, a beautiful and stern mature woman who employs Mr Binford as pimp and general manager. Miss Reba is probably the same character that appeared in Faulkner's earlier novel Sanctuary. The remainder of the story involves Ned's attempts to race the horse in order to win enough money to help out his relative and buy the car back, and Boon's courtship with Miss Corrie (whose real name is Everbe Corinthia). Lucius, a young, wealthy, and sheltered boy, comes of age in Memphis. He comes into contact for the first time with the underside of society. Much of the novel involves Lucius trying to reconcile his genteel and idealized vision of life with the reality he is faced with on this trip, portrayed in his struggle between Virtue and Non-Virtue. He meets prostitutes old and young, and is impressed by their helplessness in that society. He meets Otis, Corrie's nephew, a boy a few years older than Lucius who acts as his foil and embodies many of the worst aspects of humanity. He degrades women, respects no one, blackmails the brothel owner, steals, and curses. Eventually Lucius, ever the white knight, fights him to defend Corrie's honor when Otis explains that in the town where they come from, he rented a place where men could see Miss Corrie during sexual intercourse with men. Otis carries a penknife and cuts Lucius' hand, but to no avail. Miss Corrie is so touched at his willingness to stand up for her (\\"I've had men fight over me, but never for me\\" she says) that she determines to become an \\"honest\\" woman. Moreover, it seems that Otis is not her nephew or little brother but her son, since she has been working as a prostitute since she was sixteen. To get to the race course, they (Boon, Lucius, Miss Corrie, Miss Reba, and the horse) have to use Miss Corrie's connections in the railways, much to Boons's regret, and to undergo bullying and abuse by a local marshal that extract sexual favors from Miss Corrie. In order for Lucius to train as jockey, he has to spend a day at a black man's family (a distant relative of Ned's), sharing their beds and food. Lucius is awed by their dignity and integrity. The climax comes when Lucius rides the horse (named Coppermine, but called Lightning by Ned) in an illicit race. Coppermine is a fast horse, but he likes to run just behind the other horses so he can see them at all times. Ned convinces him to make a final burst to win the race by bribing him with what may be a sardine, like another horse he used to have. After they win the race, Lucius's grandfather shows up, and another race is run. This time Ned does not do the sardine trick, and Coppermine loses. Lucius grandfather has to buy his car back from the track owner, a plantation acquaintance. Ned has bet against Coppermine in this race, and the poor black stable hand is able to get the better of the rich white grandfather. The story ends with the news that Boon and Miss Corrie have married and named their first child after Lucius. Boon Hogganbeck Boon is also a major character in Go Down, Moses, where he appears as a McCaslin/Priest family retainer of limited education and interests. In The Reivers he shows the unexpected qualities of a car lover and a romantic hero; his marriage ties up a major \\"loose end\\" in the Faulkner canon. Ned McCaslin Ned's character resembles that of his distant relative Lucas Beauchamp in many ways. Like Lucas, he at least pretends to work for his white cousins while constantly outwitting them in various ways. The Priests invariably find it in their hearts to forgive him.

The original music score was composed by Quincy Jones. The cinematography for the film was by Charles Lang. The film received four Academy Award nominations, including ones for Gould and Cannon. Patricia Welles wrote the paperback novel from Paul Mazursky and Larry Tucker's screenplay. Plot After a weekend of emotional honesty at an Esalen-style retreat, Los Angeles sophisticates Bob and Carol Sanders (Robert Culp and Natalie Wood) return home determined to embrace complete openness. They share their enthusiasm and excitement over their new-found philosophy with their more conservative friends Ted and Alice Henderson (Elliott Gould and Dyan Cannon), who remain doubtful. Soon after, filmmaker Bob has an affair with a young production assistant on a film shoot in San Francisco. When he gets home he admits his liaison to Carol, describing the event as a purely physical act, not an emotional one. To Bob's surprise, Carol is completely accepting of his extramarital behavior. Later, Carol gleefully reveals the affair to Ted and Alice as they are leaving a dinner party. Disturbed by Bob's infidelity and Carol's candor, Alice becomes physically ill on the drive home. She and Ted have a difficult time coping with the news in bed that night. But as time passes they grow to accept that Bob and Carol really are fine with the affair. Later, Ted admits to Bob that he was tempted to have an affair once, but didn't go through with it; Bob tells Ted he should, rationalizing: \\"You've got the guilt anyway. Don't waste it.\\" During another visit to San Francisco, Bob decides to skip a second encounter with the young woman, instead returning home a day early. When he arrives, he discovers Carol having an affair with her tennis instructor. Although initially outraged, Bob quickly realizes that the encounter was purely physical, like his own affair. He settles down and even chats and drinks with the man. When the two couples travel together to Las Vegas, Bob and Carol reveal Carol's affair to Ted and Alice. Ted then admits to an affair on a recent business trip to Miami. An outraged Alice demands that this new ethos be taken to its obvious conclusion: a mate-sharing foursome. Ted is reluctant, explaining that he loves Carol \\"like a sister,\\" but eventually acknowledges that he finds her attractive. After discussing it, all four remove their clothes and climb into bed together. Swapping partners, Bob and Alice kiss fervently, as do Ted and Carol, but after a few moments all four simply stop. The scene cuts to the couples walking to the elevator, riding it down, and walking out of the casino hand-in-hand with their original partners. A crowd of men and women of various cultures and races congregate in the casino parking lot, wherein the four main characters exchange long stares with each other and with strangers, reminiscent of the non-verbal communication shown in the early scene at the retreat. Over this final scene, the film's theme song reminds the viewer that \\"what the world needs now is love.\\" The credits roll as the couples look into each other's eyes.

It opened October 8, 1969 at Cinema I in New York City before the Columbus Day holiday weekend. Reaction Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice became the signature film of Paul Mazursky and was a critical and commercial success. It was the sixth highest-grossing film of 1969. It grossed $50,000 in its first week setting a house record. After this film's release, it led to other movies dealing with wife swapping, infidelity, and other types of experimentation with interpersonal relationships inside American society. Mazursky himself would do a few more stories set in California, including Alex in Wonderland and Down and Out in Beverly Hills. Vincent Canby of The New York Times panned the film as \\"unpleasant because it acts superior to the people in it, which is no mean feat because Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice are conceived as cheerful but humorless boobs, no more equipped to deal with their sexual liberation than Lucy and Desi and Ozzie and Harriet.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun- Times, however, gave the film four stars out of four and wrote, \\"The genius of 'Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice' is that it understands the peculiar nature of the moral crisis for Americans in this age group, and understands that the way to consider it is in a comedy.\\" Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times called it \\"a scintillating social comedy and a movie which could turn out to have more to say about you than any flick you'll see this year.\\" Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film three-and-a-half-stars out of four and called it \\"the best comedy of the year,\\" with acting that was \\"eminently tender and believable.\\" Gary Arnold of The Washington Post declared it \\"the sharpest American comedy in several years ... It may be the same old marital war, but the battle lines and the weapons are modern, and this makes all the difference in the world between a comedy that feels 'new' and one that feels second-hand.\\" Writing in The New Yorker the film critic Pauline Kael praised both the film and director Mazursky, calling it \\"a slick, whorey movie, and the liveliest American comedy so far this year. Mazursky, directing his first picture, has developed a style from satiric improvisational revue theatre‚Äîhe and Tucker [co-writer] were part of the Second City troupe‚Äîand from TV situation comedy, and, with skill and wit, has made this mixture work‚Äîthough it looks conventional, it isn't.\\" John Simon called Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice 'deplorable'. The film holds a score of 83% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 18 reviews. Natalie Wood decided to gamble her $750,000 fee on a percentage of the gross, earning $5 million over the course of three years. She had deeply regretted declining a similar offer with the box office smash West Side Story.IMDb.com Awards and honors Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice was nominated for four Academy Awards in 1970: for Best Cinematography; Best Original Screenplay, Best Supporting Actor for Gould and Best Supporting Actress for Cannon. It received the 1969 New York Film Critics Awards for Best Supporting Actress (Cannon) and Best Screenplay and the 1969 Writers Guild of America Award for Best-Written American Comedy Written Directly for the Screen.\\"Awards\\" on TCM.com TV version A sitcom by Screen Gems based on the film appeared on ABC during the 1973‚Äì74 season, starring Anita Gillette, Robert Urich, David Spielberg, and Anne Archer. A 10-year-old Jodie Foster also appeared as Ted and Alice's daughter. (This differed from the film, in that Ted and Alice had a son.) Because of the overt sexual nature of the film - when it was released it was rated R - much of the humor could not be translated into a network TV project. Thus the characters needed to be substantially \\"toned down,\\" losing much of the film's edge. The series did poorly and was canceled after only one season.Lucia Bozzola, All Movie Guide In popular culture * The title of the 2016 episode of the sitcom New Girl, \\"Bob & Carol & Nick & Schmidt\\", is a play on the title of the film. * Along with Mazursky's Blume in Love (1973), Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice served as the opening feature for the reopening of Quentin Tarantino's New Beverly Cinema in Los Angeles in 2014. * Comedy television program SCTV created a comedic parody of the film titled Garth & Gord & Fiona & Alice, a \\"Canadian film made for Canadians by Canadians,\\" and distributed by American Films International.

It was designed for creating games, but the set of high- level graphics and sound commands it offers is suitable for developing multimedia software without knowledge of the internals of the Atari ST. STOS BASIC was developed by Jawx‚ÄìFran√ßois Lionet, and Constantin Sotiropoulos‚Äìand published by Mandarin Software (now known as Europress Software). History Although the first version of STOS to be released in the UK (version 2.3) was released in late 1988 by Mandarin Software, a version had been released earlier in France. Version 2.3 was bundled with three complete games (Orbit, Zoltar and Bullet Train), and many accessories and utilities (such as sprite and music editors). Initially implemented as a BASIC interpreter, a compiler was soon released that enabled the user to compile the STOS Basic program into an executable file that ran a lot faster because it was compiled rather than interpreted. In order to be compatible with the compiler, STOS needed to be upgraded to version 2.4 (which came with the compiler). STOS 2.4 also fixed a few bugs and had faster floating point mathematics code, but the floating point numbers had a smaller range. STOS 2.5 was released to make STOS run on Atari STEs with TOS 1.06 (1.6), and then STOS 2.6 was needed to make STOS run on Atari STEs with TOS 1.62. STOS 2.7 was a compiler-only upgrade that made programs with the STOS tracker extension (used to play MOD music) compile. There was a 3rd-party hack called STOS 2.07 designed to make STOS run on even more TOS versions, and behave on the Atari Falcon. Around 2001 Fran√ßois Lionet released via the Clickteam website the source code of STOS BASIC.Amos & Stos ¬ª Main Download on clickteam.com (archived 2007) On the 4th of April, 2019 Fran√ßois Lionet announced the release of AMOS2 on his website Amos2.tech. AMOS2 replaces STOS and AMOS together, using JavaScript as its code interpreter, making the new development system independent and generally deployed in internet browsers. AMOS2 is now known as AOZ Studio. Extensions It was possible to extend the functionality of STOS by adding extensions which added more commands to the language and increased the functionality. The first such extension to be released was STOS Maestro which added the ability to play sampled sounds. STOS Maestro plus was STOS Maestro bundled with a sound-sampler cartridge. Other extensions included TOME, STOS 3D, STE extension, Misty, The Missing Link, Control extension, Extra and Ninja Tracker. These extensions kept STOS alive for many years after its release. Criticisms While giving programmers the ability to rapidly create a game without knowing the internals, STOS was criticised for being slow (especially when intensively using the non-high-level commands), and for not allowing the user to program in a structured manner. Other platforms In 1990, AMOS BASIC was released for the Amiga. It was originally meant to shortly follow the release of STOS on the Atari ST. AMOS was released about two years after the UK release of STOS. But this turned out to be a blessing in disguise for the Amiga community thanks to the extra development time. Not only did AMOS take advantage of the extra Amiga hardware and have more commands than STOS, but the style of BASIC was completely different - it had no line-numbers, and there were many structured programming constructs (at one time, the STOS Club Newsletter published a program that allowed the reader to program STOS using that style). While it was often possible to directly convert STOS BASIC programs that did not heavily rely on extensions to AMOS BASIC, the reverse was not usually true. A PC version called PCOS was once mentioned, but that never materialised. Instead, the publishers Mandarin Software renamed themselves Europress Software. One of the developers in Jawx, Francois Lionet, was later to form Clickteam with Yves Lamoureux and went on to release the Klik (click) series of games-creation tools (which were dissimilar to STOS as they use a primarily mouse-driven interface without the need for traditional code). Klik & Play, The Games Factory, Multimedia Fusion and Multimedia Fusion 2 have been released in this series.

Minaker was educated at the University of Manitoba, and worked as a professional engineer after graduation. He was elected as an alderman in St. James in 1966, and was re- elected two years later for the new city of St. James‚ÄìAssiniboia. In 1969, he was chosen as chair of the city's property committee.Winnipeg Free Press, 8 January 1969, p. 12. He was elected as a councillor in the City of Winnipeg in 1971, following the decision of Edward Schreyer's NDP government to amalgamate the city. The amalgamation was unpopular with many St. James residents, and Minaker was able to use the issue to win election to the Manitoba Legislature, defeating NDP incumbent Al Mackling in the provincial election of 1973 by 374 votes. He was re-elected by a greater margin in the 1977 election, in which the Tories under Sterling Lyon won a majority government. Minaker entered cabinet on November 15, 1979 as Minister of Community Services and Corrections. The Tories were defeated in the 1981 provincial election, and Minaker lost his own riding to Al Mackling by 779 votes. He then turned to federal politics, and won riding of Winnipeg‚ÄîSt. James for the Progressive Conservatives in the general election of 1984. He defeated New Democratic Party candidate Lissa Donner by 2680 votes. He was not appointed to the cabinet of Brian Mulroney, and lost to Liberal John Harvard in the federal election of 1988. He did not returned to politics after this time. After leaving politics, Minaker worked for the National Transportation Agency in Ottawa.

Golden shower tree at full bloom Description Cassia fistula in Mus√©e Hoangho Paiho Cassia fistula flower detail The golden shower tree is a medium-sized tree, growing to tall with fast growth. The leaves are deciduous, long, and pinnate with three to eight pairs of leaflets, each leaflet long and broad. The flowers are produced in pendulous racemes long, each flower diameter with five yellow petals of equal size and shape. The fruit is a legume, long and broad, with a pungent odor and containing several seeds. The tree has strong and very durable wood, and has been used to construct \\"Ehela Kanuwa\\", a site at Adam's Peak, Sri Lanka, which is made of C. fistula (ahala, ehela, or aehaela, ‡∂á‡∑Ñ‡∑ê‡∂Ω in Sinhala sinhala botany website ) heartwood. Cultivation A flower in Chandigarh, India C. fistula is widely grown as an ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical areas. It blooms in late spring. Flowering is profuse, with trees being covered with yellow flowers, many times with almost no leaf being seen. It grows well in dry climates. Growth for this tree is best in full sun on well-drained soil; it is relatively drought-tolerant and slightly salt-tolerant. It will tolerate light brief frost, but can get damaged if the cold persists. It can be subject to mildew or leaf spot, especially during the second half of the growing season. The tree blooms better with pronounced differences between summer and winter temperatures. Pollinators and seed dispersal Seeds of Cassia fistula or Golden Shower. Various species of bees and butterflies are known to be pollinators of C. fistula flowers, especially carpenter bees (Xylocopa sp.).Murali, KS (1993) Differential reproductive success in Cassia fistula in different habitats‚ÄîA case of pollinator limitations?

The fruit pulp is considered a purgative, and self-medication or any use without medical supervision is strongly advised against in Ayurvedic texts. Though it has been used in herbalism for millennia, little research has been conducted in modern times, although it is an ingredient in some mass-produced herbal laxatives. When used as such, it is known as \\"cassia pods\\". In India, a cathartic made from the pulp is sometimes added to tobacco. Culture Fruit The golden shower tree is the state flower of Kerala. The flowers are of ritual importance in the Vishu festival of Kerala, and the tree was depicted on a 20-rupee stamp. The golden rain tree is the national flower of Thailand; its yellow flowers symbolize Thai royalty. A 2006‚Äì2007 flower festival, the Royal Flora Ratchaphruek, was named after the tree, which is known in Thai as ratchaphruek (Thai: ‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏ä‡∏û‡∏§‡∏Å‡∏©‡πå) and the blossoms commonly referred to as dok khun (Thai: ‡∏î‡∏≠‡∏Å‡∏Ñ‡∏π‡∏ô).

On , Romania and the Russian Empire signed a treaty at Bucharest under which Russian troops were allowed to pass through Romanian territory, with the condition that Russia respected the integrity of Romania. Consequently, the mobilization of the Romanian troops also began, and about 120,000 soldiers were massed in the south of the country to defend against an eventual attack of the Ottoman forces from south of the Danube. On , Russia declared war on the Ottoman Empire and its troops entered Romania through the newly built Eiffel Bridge, on their way to the Ottoman Empire. Due to great losses, the Russian Empire asked Romania to intervene. On , the first Romanian Army units crossed the Danube and joined forces with the Russian Army.Demersuri rom√¢no-ruse privind implicarea armatei rom√¢ne la sud de DunƒÉre Romanian proclamation of independence On , in the Romanian parliament, Mihail KogƒÉlniceanu read the act of independence of Romania as the will of the Romanian people. A day later, on , the act was signed by Prince Carol I, officially declaring the full state independence. According to the Constitution (Article 32), the legislative power of the State was collectively entrusted to three entities, the Senate, the Assembly of Deputies and the ruling Prince (Domnitor). The Domnitor was always the last to sanction a bill into law, promulgate and publish it; he held the full constitutional power to refuse a bill. This makes the official Independence date to be May 10, 1877, since the Declaration of Independence had no legal power without the Sovereign's signature. In fact, for symbolic reasons, the date of May 10, 1877 was chosen on purpose, since it marked the 11th celebration of the day when the German Prince Carol first came to Bucharest (May 10, 1866). After the Declaration, the Romanian government immediately cancelled paying tribute to the Ottoman Empire (914,000 lei), and the sum was given instead to the War Ministry. Initially, before 1877, Russia did not wish to cooperate with Romania, since they did not wish Romania to participate in the peace treaties after the war, but the Russians encountered a very strong Ottoman army of 40,000 soldiers led by Osman Pasha at the Siege of Plevna (Pleven) where the Russian troops led by Russian generals suffered very heavy losses and were routed in several battles.https://archive.org/stream/reminiscencesofk00kremiala \\"Reminiscences of the KING OF ROMANIA\\", Edited from the original with an Introduction by Sidney Whitman, Authorized edition, Harper& Brothers: New York and London, 1899 Conflict Due to great losses, Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolaevich, the Russian commander-in-chief, asked Prince Carol I for the Romanian Army to intervene and join forces with the Russian Army.The telegram of Nikolai to Carol I (translated in Romanian): \\"Turcii √Ængr√£m√£dind cele mai mari trupe la Plevna ne nimicesc. Rog s√£ faci fuziune, demonstratiune si dac√£'i posibil s√£ treci Dun√£rea cu armat√£ dup√£ cum doresti. √éntre Jiu si Corabia demonstratiunea aceasta este absolut necesar√£ pentru √Ænlesnirea misc√£rilor mele\\" (\\"The Turks, massing together the largest army at Pleven, are laying us waste. I ask you to make mergers, demonstrations and if it is possible cross the Danube with the army as you wish. Between Jiu and Corabia this demonstration is absolutely necessary to facilitate my movements.) Prince Carol I accepted the Duke's proposal to become the Marshal of the Russian troops in addition to the command of his own Romanian army, thus being able to lead the combined armed forces to the conquest of Plevna and the formal surrender, after heavy fighting, of the Turkish General Osman Pasha. The Army won the battles of Grivitsa and Rahova, and on 28 November 1877 the Plevna citadel capitulated, and Osman Pasha surrendered the city, the garrison and his sword to the Romanian colonel Mihail Cerchez and Russian division commander Ivan Ganetsky. After the occupation of Plevna, the Romanian Army returned to the Danube and won the battles of Vidin and Sm√¢rdan. On 19 January 1878, the Ottoman Empire requested an armistice, which was accepted by Russia and Romania. Romania won the war but at a cost of more than 19,000 casualties. Its independence from the Porte was finally recognized on 13 July 1878. =Naval operations= The gunboat Rom√¢nia The spar torpedo boat R√¢ndunica The Romanian Navy consisted of three gunboats: ≈ûtefan cel Mare, Rom√¢nia and Fulgerul and one spar torpedo boat, R√¢ndunica.Cristian CrƒÉciunoiu, Romanian Navy Torpedo Boats, p. 13 The three gunboats displaced 352, 130 and 85 tons respectively.Constantin Olteanu, The Romanian armed power concept: a historical approach, p. 152 ≈ûtefan cel Mare and Rom√¢nia were each armed with four guns and Fulgerul with one gun.W.

Kiraly, Gunther Erich Rothenberg, War and Society in East Central Europe: Insurrections, Wars, and the Eastern Crisis in the 1870s, p. 104 According to the Russian-Romanian treaty signed in April that year, the Romanian spar torpedo boat R√¢ndunica served under joint Romanian-Russian command. She was also known as Tsarevich by the Russians. Her crew consisted of two Russian Lieutenants, Dubasov and Shestakov, and three Romanians: Major Murgescu (the official liaison officer with the Russian headquarters), an engine mechanic and a navigator. The attack of R√¢ndunica took place during the night of 25‚Äì26 May 1877, near MƒÉcin. As she was approaching the Ottoman monitor Seyfi, the latter fired three rounds at her without any effect. Before she could fire the fourth round, R√¢ndunica's spar struck her between the midships and the stern. A powerful explosion followed, with debris from the Ottoman warship raising up to 40 meters in the air. The half-sunk monitor then re-opened fire, but was struck once again, with the same devastating effects. The crew of Seyfi subsequently fired their rifles at R√¢ndunica, as the latter was retreating and their monitor was sinking.

It created a Bulgarian principality and recognized the independence of Serbia, Montenegro, and Romania.http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/521651/Treaty-of-San-Stefano The Convention between Russia and Romania, which established the transit of Russian troops through the country, is one by which Russia obliged itself \\"to maintain and have the political rights of Romanian state observed, such as they result from the internal laws and the existent tratatives and also to defend the present integrity of Romania\\".Istoria Romanilor de la Carol I la Nicolae Ceausescu By Ioan Scurtu, pp 132 The Romanians believe that \\"defend\\" in a diplomatic act means recognition of the status-quo set by Congress of Paris of 1856, whereby three counties in Southern Bessarabia-part of Budjak, a region conquered by Turks around late 15th century and ruled until late 19th century when it was conquered by Russians-were taken from the Russian Empire, defeated in the Crimean War, and given back to the Romanians in Principality of Moldavia. The Russian Empire never wanted to \\"maintain and defend\\" the integrity of Romanian Principality. They wanted to conquer as much as possible from the sick man of Europe, the Black Sea region (control of Danube) all the way to Constantinopole (Dardanelles/Bosphorus) and the Mediterranean Sea. The treaty was not recognised by the Central Powers and the 1878 peace conference in Berlin decided that Russia would give Romania its independence, the territories of Northern Dobruja, the Danube Delta and access to the Black Sea including the ancient port of Tomis, as well as the tiny Snake Island (Insula ≈ûerpilor), but Russia would nevertheless occupy as a so-called \\"compensation\\" the old Romanian Southern counties of Bessarabia (Cahul, Bolgrad and Ismail), which by the Treaty of Paris of 1856 (after the Crimean War) were included in Moldavia. Prince Carol was most unhappy by this unfavorable turn of negotiations; he was finally persuaded by Bismarck (in now-published original letters exchanged at that time) to accept this compromise with Russia in view of the great economical potential of Romania's direct access to the Black Sea and its ancient ports at the expense of Bulgaria.https://archive.org/stream/reminiscencesofk00kremiala \\"Reminiscences of the KING OF ROMANIA\\", Edited from the original with an Introduction by Sidney Whitman, Authorized edition, Harper& Brothers: New York and London, 1899, pp.15‚Äì20.

Under the system, electorates were allocated to zones such as rural or metropolitan and electoral boundaries drawn so that rural electorates had about half as many voters as metropolitan ones. The Country Party (later National Party), a rural-based party led by Joh Bjelke-Petersen, was able to govern uninhibited during this period due to the 'Bjelkemander' and the absence of an upper house of Parliament. Origin of term The term is a portmanteau of Joh Bjelke- Petersen's surname with the word \\"Gerrymander\\", where electoral boundaries are redrawn in an unnatural way with the dominant intention of favouring one political party or grouping over its rivals. Although Bjelke-Petersen's 1972 redistributions occasionally had elements of \\"gerrymandering\\" in the strict sense, their perceived unfairness had more to do with malapportionment whereby certain areas (normally rural) are simply granted more representation than their population would dictate if electorates contained equal numbers of voters (or population). Electoral system under Bjelke-Petersen When the Country (later National) Party first won power in 1957 under Bjelke-Petersen's predecessor, Frank Nicklin, it inherited a system of malapportionment from the previous Labor Party government. After becoming premier Nicklin reworked this setup to benefit the Country and Liberal parties. The provincial cities were split off from their hinterlands, where new Country Party seats were created. At the same time, more Liberal seats were created in the Brisbane area. While fairer than Labor's map, it was still slanted toward the Coalition. Bjelke- Petersen tweaked this setup even further after becoming premier, benefiting his own Country Party at the expense of the Labor and Liberal parties. In Queensland, unlike at the federal level and in the other states, the Country/National Party was the senior partner in the non-Labor coalition, with the Liberals as junior partner. However, Bjelke-Petersen's system discriminated against the Liberals as much, if not more heavily, than the Labor Party. As a party drawing its votes mainly in Brisbane, the Liberals were regarded by Bjelke-Petersen as \\"small-l-liberal and not representative of Country/National interests. When he became premier, the Country Party and the Liberals held roughly the same number of seats, providing further incentive for the Country Party to increase their parliamentary numbers at the expense of the Liberals. History From 1910 to 1949, Queensland had a \\"one person, one vote, one value\\" electoral system, with a maximum variation of 30% from the Statewide average quota. But in 1949 the Labor Party conducted a revision which varied the number of voters in each electorate according to their size and distance from Brisbane, the state capital in the far south-east of the huge state. Although difficulties in transport and communication were given as the reasons to reduce the size of remote and thinly-populated electorates, the effect was to give a huge advantage to the Labor Party, which at that time drew its voting strength from rural areas, a consequence of the party's formation in the outback Queensland town of Barcaldine half a century earlier. The newly elected Country Party MP for Nanango, Joh Bjelke-Petersen, spoke out against the redistribution, saying that it meant that \\"the majority will be ruled by the minority\\" and that the Labor government was telling the people \\"whether you like it or not, we will be the Government\\". The 1957 ALP split, in which Labor Premier Vince Gair led many MPs out of the party to form the Queensland Labor Party (QLP), undermined the advantage of the malapportionment to Labor. Since the boundaries were drawn to take advantage of the ALP's rural supporters (farm workers, miners etc.) the rural-based Country Party was able to take the most advantage from Labor's infighting. In 1971, Bjelke-Petersen, who had become Premier in 1968, proposed to refine the malapportionment to favour his party at the expense of his Coalition partners, the Liberal Party, as well as Labor. Electoral demographics had changed since 1949 and Labor now drew most of its support from urban concentrations of workers. Labor opposed the scheme, as did enough of the Liberals to defeat the bill in Parliament. However, Bjelke-Petersen worked during a four-month Parliamentary recess to redraft the scheme just enough to ensure the support of the Liberals. The new map was used as the basis for the May 1972 election, from which Bjelke- Petersen emerged victorious as Premier despite only receiving 20% of the vote, a smaller percentage than the Liberals (22.2%) or Labor (46.7%). But due to the Country Party's heavy concentration of support in the rural and remote zones, it won 26 seats. Combined with the Liberals' 21 seats, this gave the Coalition 47 seats to Labor's 33, consigning Labor to opposition even though it won far more actual votes. In 1977 another redistribution eliminated some Liberal seats, reducing the internal threat to the Country Party (now renamed the National Party) from its coalition partner. Electoral effect The putative reasons given for reducing the number of voters in remote and rural electorates have some validity. In 1949 the electorate of Gregory was larger in area than Great Britain, but contained fewer than 6000 voters. In addition it contained vast areas of desert and the few communities were poorly served by road and rail links. Other electorates were almost as large, and in fact the four electorates of Gregory, Cook, Flinders and Mount Isa together comprised nearly two-thirds of Queensland's entire landmass. The difficulties of keeping in touch with the population over such enormous and diverse regions were cited by both Labor (in 1949) and the Country Party in 1971 as reasons for malapportionment. At the 1956 election the change from the previous one vote-one value system was dramatic. The Brisbane-area seat of Mount Gravatt had 26307 voters, while the seat of Charters Towers in far northern Queensland had just 4367, a ratio of six to one. If the number of votes cast per party is divided by the number of seats won, the effect on party representation is underscored. In 1956 the Labor Party needed 7000 votes to win each seat, the Country Party 9900, and the Liberals 23800. Using the Dauer-Kelsay Index, which calculates the smallest percentage of voters needed to win an election, the theoretical ideal being just over 50%, at the 1957 election this number was 39.1%, meaning that the non-Labor parties would have required more than 60% of the vote to win. Other low scores in Australian electoral history were the South Australian 'Playmander' with a low of 23.4% on the Dauer-Kelsay Index, and Victoria in 1974, registering 40.3%. By this index, Bjelke- Petersen's 1972 revision was actually a step towards democracy, with the index rising to 44.9%, and the disparity in electorate sizes reduced with Pine Rivers (16758 voters) and Gregory (6723) marking the extremes. In terms of vote per seat, the Country Party needed 7000 votes to win each seat, Liberal 9600 and Labor 12800. However, the effect was that Bjelke-Petersen was Premier of the state on just 20% of the primary vote. The following table shows the figures for the 1972 election: The Labor Party won 33 seats, the largest of any single party. However, since the Coalition had 47 seats between them, Labor was consigned to Opposition despite winning almost 41,000 more primary votes than the Coalition. Bjelke-Petersen's Country Party had 26 seats to the Liberals' 21. Thus, as leader of the senior coalition partner, Bjelke-Petersen stayed on as premier. It can also be seen from the above table that the DLP had 7.7% of the vote, but won no seats at all. Most of these votes flowed through preferential voting away from the Labor Party, exacerbating the effect of the \\"Bjelkemander\\". Other factors The malapportionment favouring country areas helped Labor in 1949 onwards and the Country Party from 1957. The 1972 redistribution introduced a gerrymander effect favouring the Country Party, by which boundaries were drawn to consolidate Labor-voting populations and diversify Country supporters. A seat won with 50.1% of the vote was just as good in Parliament as one with 100% support. Liberal and especially Labor voters were usually found in identifiable \\"clumps\\" within Brisbane and the regional cities, a reflection of the income levels available to workers and the middle class dividing them between desirable and less desirable suburbs. The metropolis of Brisbane was a zone of limited support for Bjelke-Petersen's Country Party, but fertile ground was found in the regional centres where Labor populations could be aggregated together and the rural voters of the surrounding districts distributed to electorates where they would be of most use to the Country Party. End of the Bjelkemander The resignation of Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen in 1987 and the defeat of the National Party by Labor Government under Wayne Goss in 1989 led to the implementation of more equitable electoral boundaries, which was achieved by a redistribution in 1991 which took effect at the 1992 election. Acting on the recommendations of the Electoral and Administrative Review Commission (EARC), the Goss Labor Government legislated for a compromise system which allocated 40 of the legislature's 89 seats to the Brisbane area‚Äîalmost half the legislature. Most seats had roughly the same number of voters, and no seat's population could vary from the statewide average by more than 10%. However, an electorate over 100,000 square km in area could be counted as having notional extra voters (dubbed \\"phantom voters\\" by the media) equal to 2% of its area in square kilometres. Only five of the 89 districts qualified for this special loading, and since these were (a) huge in area, and (b) not solidly National (e.g. Mount Isa and Cook have been regularly held by Labor over the last quarter- century), the retention of this small degree of rural vote-weighting is no longer a matter of political controversy in Queensland.

He grew up around film and television production, and developed an interest in the field because of the work of his father, director Chuck Bowman. Bowman is a prolific director for television, and has contributed to series such as Star Trek: The Next Generation, and The X-Files, for which he received four consecutive Emmy nominations as a producer. He was an executive producer and director for the comedy-drama Castle. Bowman has directed four feature films: Airborne, The X-Files, Reign of Fire, and Elektra. Early life and education Bowman grew up around film and television production. His father, Chuck Bowman, is a filmmaker who became active in the industry when Rob was an adolescent. Bowman first became fascinated with the process of filmmaking when he saw The Wizard of Oz as a child. Growing up, he watched his father make commercials and documentaries, often acting as an assistant crew member. Bowman said that conversations with his father enabled him to see how the hard work of a filmmaking crew becomes invisible when the film is made. He said, \\"what remains are the emotions and the drama of the story and the characters. What remains is the magic.\\" In his late teens, he moved to Utah, where he became a \\"ski bum\\", and worked as a bartender. After writing, producing and directing a story for a film production class at the University of Utah, Bowman knew he wanted to be a filmmaker. \\"It became as clear to me as a Fourth of July fireworks display that was where my passion was,\\" he said. Bowman moved to Los Angeles, and got a job at Stephen Cannell Productions, starting in the mail room. He took film classes, and studied film directors, developing a sense of his own personal style. He became fascinated with how each director used the same tools, but arrived at a unique aesthetic. He said, \\"I learned early on that to be successful as a director, you had to have your own signature. Otherwise, why hire one person over another?\\" He worked for Cannell for over two years, observing the production of over 400 hours of television. Around age 20, he wrote a mission statement for himself, committing himself to strive for excellence in filmmaking. Career =Star Trek: The Next Generation and early work= Bowman started directing for television while doing second unit work for Stephen Cannell Productions in 1982. After leaving Cannell's company in 1987, he sent out videos of his work, looking for a job. Impressed by one of Bowman's Stringray episodes, producer Robert H. Justman hired him to direct for Star Trek: The Next Generation during its first season. Bowman was only 27 years old at the time, and in his first meeting with executive producer Rick Berman, Berman mistook him for the pizza delivery boy. He was originally slated to direct the 10th episode of Star Trek's first season, but one of the series' directors, Donald Petrie, dropped out early to direct the film Mystic Pizza. This gave Bowman the opportunity to direct the fourth episode of the season, \\"Where No One Has Gone Before\\". Bowman investigated the sets two weeks early to begin prepping the episode. Bowman told Starlog magazine, \\"Walking through those empty sets was very intimidating for me. I kept asking myself how I was going to do justice to these sets, tell the story and still get the performances from the cast.\\" Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry was so impressed with the dailies for the episode, that he made an appearance on set to praise Bowman in front of the cast and crew. Immediately following directing \\"Where No One Has Gone Before\\", Bowman directed an episode of the Fox Broadcasting Company's television series Werewolf. Berman and Justman had planned to hire Bowman for only a single episode, but his agent worked out a two-episode deal, leading to Bowman directing the ninth Star Trek episode, \\"The Battle\\". 1988 was a busy year for Bowman. In addition to directing five more episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation that year, he also directed episodes for Werewolf, Sonny Spoon, The Highwayman, Probe, and 21 Jump Street. On the strength of his direction for the television series Parker Lewis Can't Lose, he was offered to direct his first feature film, Airborne, a coming-of-age story involving teenage rollerbladers. =The X-Files= After seeing a commercial for The X-Files pilot episode, Bowman called his agent and told him he wanted to direct for the series. He was asked to direct the episode \\"Gender Bender\\" for The X-Files by executive producer R. W. Goodwin, who had previously worked with Bowman on the series Mancuso, F.B.I.. X-Files creator and executive producer Chris Carter invited Bowman to return and direct more episodes. Bowman was eventually made a producer on the series. =Castle= alt=Andrew Marlowe and Rob Bowman working on the set of Castle. The American Broadcasting Company (ABC) hired Bowman to direct the pilot for Castle, a television series about a crime novelist who consults with the New York City Police Department (NYPD). The series was created by Andrew Marlowe, who served as executive producer along with his wife Terri Miller. When Miller stepped down as executive producer, Bowman took on the role. Style Bowman's signature visual style involves lighting contrasts within a scene, including framing actors as silhouettes. The X-Files writer and producer Frank Spotnitz said that Bowman works very hard to make every \\"scene as beautiful and as complementary to the story as possible\\". He said that Bowman's camera movements were never gratuitous and were deliberately planned to aid viewers in understanding what was happening in a scene. Spotnitz complimented Bowman's attention to lighting for mood, saying \\"You would think that on a television schedule you don't have time to compose and think thoroughly about all these issues, but Rob really does.\\" Filmography =Director= Television *The Rookie (2019) - 1 episode *Quantico (2018) - 1 episode *The Crossing (2018) *Castle (2009‚Äì2016) - 28 episodes *The Lone Gunmen (2001) (pilot) *VR.5 (1995) - 1 episode *M.A.N.T.I.S.

It was the easternmost part of the Braidfauld (45th) Ward of the City of Glasgow, and has been in the larger Shettleston ward since 2007. The role of public transport in spreading the name The quaint name was made famous throughout the city by Glasgow Corporation Tramways. Auchenshuggle was the eastern terminus of tram service number 9 and was duly carried on the destination boards of tramcars. Service No 9 ran between Auchenshuggle and Dalmuir West (a district of Clydebank). The service was extended from its previous terminus at Springfield Road in 1922. The area is at the east end of Glasgow close to London Road, and it was often said that Glasgow Corporation Transport Department invented the name so that curious tourists and city dwellers would travel there thus increasing revenue. In fact, the terminus (at Braidfauld Street) was directly opposite a group of 19th century cottages, now replaced by 1960s council houses, named \\"Auchenshuggle Cottages\\". Service No 9 was the final route on which trams were run in the city. The last regular tram ran on 1 September 1962. On 2, 3 and 4 September, a special tram service was operated between Auchenshuggle and Anderston Cross on which souvenir tickets were sold. This proved attractive to those who wished to take a final sentimental journey. The route was taken by bus service No 64. There was also service No. 22 which operated between Auchenshuggle and Castlemilk via Shettleston Road, Duke Street and Rutherglen, however this service has been withdrawn. No service currently [June 2015] uses Auchenshuggle terminus or even the destination on its signage, although it does still stop there. Also the link between Clydebank and Auchenshuggle on service 64 no longer exists, the 64 terminates in Glasgow City Centre and no longer serves Clydebank. Service 308 also uses Auchenshuggle as a stop. There was a railway station at Auchinshuggle between the 1890s and the 1960s, but it was named . Auchenshuggle Wood and Community Nature Park The Auchenshuggle Wood lies to the south of London Road, and is now site of a community nature park, established in 1982. After the Glasgow Commonwealth Games in 2014, the park was designated a Commonwealth Woodland as part of the Games legacy project. Recent developments As part of the northern extension of the M74 Motorway, a new Auchenshuggle Bridge over the River Clyde was completed and opened in 2011.

Jokes frequently targeted political figures, such as Socialist Party General Secretary Erich Honecker or State Security Minister Erich Mielke, who headed the Stasi secret police.Ben Lewis, Hammer and Tickle: A Cultural History of Communism, London: Pegasus, 2010 Elements of daily life, such as economic scarcity, relations between the GDR and the Soviet Union or Cold War rival, the United States, were also common.Ben Lewis, \\"Hammer & tickle,\\" Prospect Magazine, May 2006 There were also ethnic jokes, highlighting differences of language or culture between Saxony and Central Germany.  Political jokes as a tool of protest  Hans J√∂rg Schmidt sees the political joke in the GDR as a tool to voice discontent and protest. East German jokes thus mostly address political, economic and social issues, criticise important politicians such as Ulbricht or Honecker, and political institutions or decisions. For this reason, Schmidt sees them as an indicator for popular opinion or as a ‚Äúpolitical barometer‚Äù that signals the opinion trends among the population.  Sentences  According to Bodo M√ºller, an expert of East German jokes, no one was ever officially convicted due to a joke; the Stasi called it propaganda that was a threat to the state or anti-state agitation. Officially, it was seen as a violation of Paragraph 19 \\"State-endangering propaganda and hate speech\\". However, it was taken very seriously, with friends and neighbours being interrogated. The trials were mostly public and thus, the jokes were never read there. Of the 100 people in Bodo M√ºller‚Äôs research, 64 were convicted for one or more jokes. The sentence was usually between one and three years in prison. The harshest verdict was four years.Bodo Mueller (2016). Lachen gegen die Ohnmacht: DDR-Witze im Visier der Stasi Most of the sentences were handed down in the 1950s, before the Wall was built. After that, there was a rapid decline in sentences for joke- tellers, with the last verdict in 1972 against three engineers who had told jokes in the breakfast break. The Stasi continued to arrest joke-tellers, but convictions ceased. In the 1980s, reports of popular sentiment delivered by the Stasi to SED district councils on a monthly basis revealed more and more statements about political jokes recounted in company, union, and even party rallies.  Operation GDR joke  In the Cold War times, the GDR was also one of the target areas of the West German Federal Intelligence Service. In the mid-1970s, someone in Pullach had the startling idea of intelligence gathering and evaluating political jokes about \\"over there\\". Thus, at the end of 1977, the BND in Pullach launched the secret operation \\"GDR joke\\", whereby BND agents had to collect and evaluate political jokes in the GDR. Among other things, the staff interviewed refugees and displaced persons from the GDR in the emergency accommodation camps of the FRG. So-called \\"train investigators\\" - mostly middle-aged women - listened to their fellow passengers in seemingly harmless chats. Additionally, West German citizens, who received visitors from the GDR or were themselves on kinship visits in the east, were asked for jokes. Overall, the BND succeeded in discovering thousands of GDR jokes within 14 years. Of these, 657 reached the office of the Federal Chancellor on secret service routes.  Examples  = Country and politics = Erich Honecker presents an award to Stasi chief Erich Mielke (1980) * Which three great nations in the world begin with \\"U\\"? ‚Äî USA, USSR, and our GDR. (German: Was sind die drei gro√üen Nationen der Welt, beginnend mit \\"U\\"? _U_ SA, _U_ dSSR, und _u_ nsere DDR. This alludes to how official discourse often used the phrase \\"our GDR\\", and also often exaggerated the GDR's world status.) * The United States, the Soviet Union and the GDR want to raise the Titanic. The United States wants the jewels presumed to be in the safe, the Soviets are after the state-of-the-art technology, and the GDR - the GDR wants the band that played as it went down. * A school teacher asks little Fritzie: \\"Fritzchen, why are you always speaking of our Soviet brothers? It's Soviet friends.\\" ‚Äî \\"Well, you can always choose your friends.\\" * Capitalism is the exploitation of man by man. What about Socialism? Under Socialism it is exactly the other way around. (German: Kapitalismus ist die Ausbeutung des Menschen durch den Menschen. Und wie ist es mit dem Sozialismus? Da ist es genau umgekehrt!) * A trainee on his first day on his new job in a newspaper office. The news comes in over the wire that 'Sicily has drifted away from Italy and is now stranded on the English coast.' In the paper the next day, no mention is made of the event. Instead, the headline reads 'Harvest Saved'. 'Notice', the chief editor says to the astonished young man, 'our newspaper's task is not to inform our citizens, but to confuse the class enemy.' * Why is toilet paper so rough in the GDR? In order to make every last asshole red. = Stasi = *How can you tell that the Stasi has bugged your apartment? ‚Äî There's a new cabinet in it and a trailer with a generator in the street. (This is an allusion to the primitive state of East German microelectronics.) *Honecker and Mielke are discussing their hobbies. Honecker: \\"I collect (German sammeln) all the jokes about me.\\" Mielke: \\"Well we have almost the same hobby. I collect (German einsammeln, used figuratively like to garner) all those who tell jokes about you.\\" (Compare with a similar Russian political joke.) *Why do Stasi officers make such good taxi drivers? ‚Äî You get in the car and they already know your name and where you live. *Why do the Stasi work together in groups of three? ‚Äî You need one who can read, one who can write, and a third to keep an eye on the two intellectuals. = Honecker = Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev locked in a socialist fraternal kiss with Honecker * Early in the morning, Honecker arrives at his office and opens his window. He greets the Sun, saying: \\"Good morning, dear Sun!\\" ‚Äî \\"Good morning, dear Erich!\\" Honecker works, and then at noon he heads to the window and says: \\"Good day, dear Sun!\\" ‚Äî \\"Good day, dear Erich!\\" In the evening, Erich calls it a day, and heads once more to the window, and says: \\"Good evening, dear Sun!\\" Hearing nothing, Honecker says again: \\"Good evening, dear Sun! What's the matter?\\" The sun retorts: \\"Kiss my arse. I'm in the West now!\\" (from the 2006 Oscar-winning movie The Lives of Others) * What do you do when you get Honecker on the phone? Hang up and try again. (This is a pun with the German words aufh√§ngen und neuw√§hlen, meaning both \\"hang up the phone and dial again\\" and \\"hang him and vote again\\".) *Leonid Brezhnev is asked what his opinion of Honecker is: \\"Well, politically ‚Äì I don't have much esteem for him. But ‚Äì he definitely knows how to kiss!\\" * A plane with Brezhnev, Carter and Honecker comes down to hell. The devil welcomes them and asks them which country they're from. Brezhnev: 'Soviet Union. We are the biggest country of the world.' Devil: 'I don't know. Off to the cauldron.' Carter: 'United States. We are the mightiest country of the world.' Devil: 'I don't know. Off to the cauldron.' Honecker: 'My country is very small. You won't know it: GDR.' Devil: 'Sure. Peace, Friendship, Solidarity. That's where our kettle is from.' (Allusion to the extensive exports in order to get hard currency.) = Economy = * When an East German retiree returns from his first trip to West Germany, his children ask him what it was like. He replies: 'Well, it's basically the same as here: you can get anything for West German marks.' * What are the four deadly enemies of socialism? Spring, summer, autumn, winter. * Two snowflakes in the sky: 'I'm heading to Sweden, to bring joy to the children.' - 'I'm going to the GDR, to bring down the economy.' * What would happen if the desert became a socialist country? ‚Äî Nothing for a while‚Ä¶ then the sand becomes scarce. * How can you use a banana as a compass? ‚Äî Place a banana on the Berlin Wall. The bitten end would point East. = Trabant = Showcased Trabant 601 (1963) * What's the best feature of a Trabant? ‚Äî There's a heater at the back to keep your hands warm when you're pushing it. * What does \\"601\\" stand for?\\" (in German, \\"601\\" is read as \\"six hundred and one\\") ** (original version) 600 people ordered cars, and only one has had it delivered. ** (variant from 1990) 600 cars on the dealership lot, and only one customer. ** (other variant) Space for 6 people, comfort for zero, and one to push it. * How do you catch a Trabi? ‚Äî Just stick chewing gum on the highway. (Allusion to the Trabant's underpowered motor.) * What is the longest car on the market? ‚Äî The Trabant, at 12 meters length. 2 meters of car, plus ten meters of smoke. * A man driving a Trabant suddenly breaks his windshield wiper. Pulling into a service station, he hails a mechanic. 'Wipers for a Trabi?' he asks. The mechanic thinks about it for a few seconds and replies, 'Yes, sounds like a fair trade.' (Allusion to the shortage of spare parts for cars.) * A new Trabi has been launched with two exhaust pipes ‚Äî so you can use it as a wheelbarrow. * How do you double the value of a Trabant? ‚Äî Fill it with gas. * A citizen orders a Trabant car. The salesman tells him to come back to pick it up in nine years. The customer asks: 'Am I to come back in the morning or in the evening then?' ‚Äî 'You're joking, aren't you? What is the difference?' ‚Äî 'Well sir, the plumber's coming in the morning.' = Saxons = * The doorbell rings. The woman of the house goes to the door and quickly returns, looking rather startled: \\"Dieter! There's a man outside who just asks, Tat√º tata?\\" (Tat√º tata is onomatopoeia for the sound of a police car siren). Dieter goes to the door and comes back laughing. \\"It's my colleague from Saxony, asking s do Dieto da?\\" (standard German Ist der Dieter da?, i.e. \\"Is Dieter there?\\", in Saxon dialect) * A Saxon sits at a table in a cafe. Another man takes a seat and kicks him in the shin. He glances up briefly but says nothing. The man kicks him again. Now the Saxon says: 'If you do this for a third time, I will switch to another table.' (Allusion to the Saxon's mentality.)

The Grand Theatre, Leeds, home of Opera North Opera North is an English opera company based in Leeds. The company's home theatre is the Leeds Grand Theatre, but it also presents regular seasons in several other cities, at the Theatre Royal, Nottingham, the Lowry Centre, Salford Quays and the Theatre Royal, Newcastle. The Company's orchestra, the Orchestra of Opera North, regularly performs and records in its own right. Operas are performed either in English translation or in the original language of the libretto, in the latter case usually with surtitles. The major funders of Opera North include Arts Council England and, in Yorkshire, Leeds City Council, West Yorkshire Grants, North Yorkshire County Council, and East Riding of Yorkshire Council. History Opera North was established in 1977 as English National Opera North, as an offshoot of English National Opera, with the specific intention of delivering high-quality opera to the northern areas of England which, up to that point, had had no permanently established opera company. The company gave its first performance, of Saint-Sa√´ns's Samson and Delilah, on 15 November 1978. The founding Music Director of the company was David Lloyd-Jones, who held the post until 1990. In 1981, the company's name was changed to Opera North, and the official ties with English National Opera ceased to exist. Paul Daniel became the company's second music director, serving in the post from 1990 to 1997. With general administrators Nicholas Payne and, later, Ian Ritchie and Richard Mantle, the company continued to bring operatic novelties, as well as a wide selection of familiar works, to its audience in the North of England and further afield. Following Daniel's departure, Elgar Howarth held the temporary post of Music Advisor, until Steven Sloane became Music Director in 1999. Richard Farnes became music director in 2004. Achievements during his tenure included the company's first staging of Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen, over a span of 4 years. Farnes stood down as music director after the 2015‚Äì2016 season. In October 2015, Aleksandar Markoviƒá made his first appearance as guest conductor with the company. In February 2016, the company announced the appointment of Markoviƒá as its next music director, effective with the 2016‚Äì2017 season. His first production as music director of the company was in September 2016, with Der Rosenkavalier. On 18 April 2017, Opera North announced that Markoviƒá had resigned as the company's music director, with his contract formally to terminate in July 2017, but where he is not to appear with the company for the remainder of the 2016‚Äì2017 season. In June 2019, Opera North announced the appointments of Garry Walker as its next music director, and of Antony Hermus as its new principal guest conductor. Walker is scheduled to take up the post as of the 2020-2021 season. Characteristics of the company =Repertory= As well as presenting the bread-and-butter operas of the standard repertory, the company has performed a number of operas that are rarely seen in Britain. Examples include: * Les mamelles de Tir√©sias (Poulenc) (1978) * The Mines of Sulphur (Richard Rodney Bennett) (1980) * A Village Romeo and Juliet (Delius) (1980) * Prince Igor (Alexander Borodin) (1982) * Beatrice and Benedict (Berlioz) (1983) * Johnny Strikes Up (Krenek) (1984, British premi√®re) * Intermezzo (Richard Strauss) (1986) * Daphne (Strauss) (1987, British premi√®re) * La finta giardiniera (Mozart) (1989) * J√©rusalem (Verdi) (1990, British premi√®re) * Ariane and Bluebeard (Dukas) (1990) * Masquerade (Carl Nielsen) (1990, British professional premi√®re) * King Priam (Michael Tippett) (1991) * L'√©toile (Chabrier) (1991) * The Jewel Box (Mozart, arranged by Paul Griffiths) (1991) * The Thieving Magpie (Rossini) (1992) * Iolanta (Tchaikovsky) (1992) * The Duenna (Roberto Gerhard) (1992, British premi√®re) * Der ferne Klang (Schreker) (1992, British premi√®re) * La Gioconda (Ponchielli) (1993) * Gloriana (Britten) (1993) * Il re pastore (Mozart) (1993) * The Secret Marriage (Cimarosa) (1993) * Oberto (Verdi) (1994, British stage premi√®re) * The Reluctant King (Chabrier) (1994, British stage premi√®re) * Troilus and Cressida (William Walton) (1995) * Hamlet (Ambroise Thomas) (1995) * Medea (Cherubini) (1996) * Julietta (Martin≈Ø) (1997) * Joan of Arc (Verdi) (1998) * Radamisto (Handel) (2000) * Genoveva (Schumann) (2000) * Paradise Moscow (Shostakovich) (2001) * Francesca da Rimini (Rachmaninov) (2004) * Love's Luggage Lost (Rossini) (2004, British stage premi√®re) * Djamileh (Bizet) (2004) * La vida breve (Manuel de Falla) (2004) * La voix humaine (Poulenc) (2006) * The Fortunes of King Croesus (Reinhard Keiser) (2007, British premi√®re) * The Excursions of Mr Broucek (Jan√°ƒçek) (2009) * The Snow Maiden (Rimsky-Korsakov) (2017) * Trouble in Tahiti (Leonard Bernstein) (2017) * The Greek Passion (Martin≈Ø) (2019) In 2011, the company performed The Portrait by Mieczys≈Çaw Weinberg and initiated an annual series of semi-staged concert performances of the four operas in Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen by performing Das Rheingold in Leeds Town Hall. Beached, a community opera by composer Harvey Brough with a libretto by Lee Hall co-commissioned by Opera North and the sea-side resort of Bridlington premiered on 15 July 2011. At the request of the Bridlington primary school whose 300 children performed in the opera, the company asked for the removal of an explicit reference to a gay character's sexuality from one of the scenes. Hall initially refused, and the opera was withdrawn. However, following negotiations the matter was resolved when the character's contentious line \\"Of course I'm queer\\" was changed to \\"Of course I'm gay\\". =World premieres= Opera North has given world premi√®res of the following operas: Rebecca by Wilfred Josephs (1983), Caritas by Robert Saxton (1991), Baa, Baa, Black Sheep by Michael Berkeley (1993), Playing Away by Benedict Mason (1994), The Nightingale's to Blame by Simon Holt (1998), Jonathan Dove's The Adventures of Pinocchio (2007) and Swanhunter (2009), and Skin Deep by David Sawer and Armando Iannucci (2009). In July 2009, Opera North premi√®red Prima Donna, a new opera by Rufus Wainwright, at the Manchester International Festival. =Musical theatre= Opera North has also given performances of musical theatre works. The first was Jerome Kern's Show Boat (in collaboration with the Royal Shakespeare Company) in 1989, and productions of Gershwin's Of Thee I Sing and Sondheim's Sweeney Todd followed in 1998. A joint production with West Yorkshire Playhouse of Sondheim's Into the Woods was staged in Leeds in 2016.https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jun/12/into-the-woods-review-west- yorkshire-playhouse Latterly, the works of Kurt Weill have become something of a speciality, with productions of Love Life (1996), One Touch of Venus and The Seven Deadly Sins in 2004, Arms and the Cow in 2006, and Street Scene in 2020. In 2009, Let 'Em Eat Cake, the sequel to Of Thee I Sing, was produced, and in 2012 Rodgers and Hammerstein's Carousel was performed in Leeds, Salford and London.. =Electronic music= Opera North has worked extensively with electronic composer Mira Calix, commissioning Dead Wedding (for the Manchester International Festival 2007) Onibus (2008) and the installation Chorus (2009) for the opening of the Howard Assembly Rooms with visual artist UVA.

It has a population of 6,700. An affluent suburb during Victorian times, Birkby sits in the Grimescar Valley, a greenbelt area of Huddersfield. Birkby contains Norman Park, a small park with a play area and war memorial, which commemorates those who died in the First World War.  History  The name Birkby is not recorded until 1561, when it was spelt Byrkebye. The origin of the name is uncertain. It is probably of Old Danish origin, from birk \\"birch tree\\" and by \\"settlement\\". From the study of old Ordnance Survey maps, much of the district of Birkby remained largely rural well into the 20th century, with the original settlement lying close to the town centre. Bay Hall, a local historic house dates from the 16th century but was largely restored in 1895, as a date plaque on the residence indicates. Birkby can effectively be bisected into two distinct areas; St Johns road being the main thoroughfare. Birkby is generally more affluent to the north and west of the main thoroughfare. This can be seen with a comparison of a south Birkby postcode HD2 2RT having an average home price of ¬£121,892 and a northern Birkby postcode of HD2 2DU having an average home price of ¬£450,000, although this shows anomalies and is not a general trend. Recently, Birkby has seen significant residential development, as the Hopkinson's Valve Works has been redeveloped for housing On Sunday 12 May 2002, an arson attack took place at 40 Osborne Road, Birkby, killing eight people, including a six-month-old girl. All had been sleeping whilst the house was deliberately set on fire. One of the arsonists, Shahid Mohammed, who had fled to Pakistan, was found guilty of eight counts of murder on 6 August 2019 and was motivated by an inter-family dispute. His accomplices, Shaied Iqbal, Nazar Hussain and Shakiel Shazad, were convicted in 2003. Det Ch Supt Nick Wallen said after the verdict concerning Shahid Mohammed that the incident remains the largest single event of multiple murders that West Yorkshire Police has investigated.  Amenities and buildings  St John the Evangelist church It has a catholic primary school, St. Patrick's, as well as Birkby Infant and Nursery School, located on Blacker Road. Birkby Junior School is located to the east of Birkby and is addressed as Fartown, Huddersfield. Birkby is a semi-rural area, home to a large white and Asian population, having four mosques. Elsewhere, the suburb contains two Church of England chapels, a Buddhist centre, as well as a meetinghouse for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The centre of Birkby, located around the east of Blacker Road and the north of St John's Road, has a high concentration of Asian retailers and food outlets, serving the local Asian community.

It was founded in 1911 and was historically a women's college until 2014. It currently serves fewer than 400 students, many of whom live on the 40-acre campus. Originally the college was a post-graduate program of Dana Hall School, an all girl's preparatory high school, although today it is an independent college serving primarily students of color. In May 2020, with the institution's longterm financial instability exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, Boston College announced that it would take over the college, in a graduated scheme that will allow current Pine Manor students to study on their campus through the 2022 school year. History The college was founded in 1911 as Pine Manor Junior College (PMJC) by Helen Temple Cooke, as part of the Dana Hall School in Wellesley, Massachusetts. It was a women-only institution at a time when women were generally denied access to higher education. Mary Almy was the architect. Author and educator Ella Lyman Cabot taught at PMJC in its early days. Pioneering female architect Eleanor Manning O'Connor taught at PMJC in the 1930s;MIT (1906). Senior Portfolio, p. 30. Sparrell Print, Boston, p. 7. educator Mary Nourse taught history there in 1933‚Äì1934. Mary Virginia Harris, a veteran of World War II who served in the Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service (WAVES) program and who wrote its manual, was a dean there. In 1965 the school moved to a estate in the Chestnut Hill neighborhood of Brookline. The estate, then known as Roughwood, was the residence of Ernest B. Dane, at that time president of the Brookline Savings and Trust. Many of the school's buildings are original to the estate and have been renovated to accommodate the college.Pine Manor College campus In 1977, under the leadership of President Rosemary Ashby, the school expanded its mission to offer four-year bachelor's degrees, and became Pine Manor College. However, by the end of President Rosemary Ashby's tenure in the mid-nineties, enrollment had declined by 50 percent to less than 300 full-time students, threatening the survival of the college. In 1996, under new president Gloria Nemerowicz, the school changed its mission from educating women in the social elite to educating women of color from under-served communities. This was made possible, in large part, due to the generosity of wealthy older alumnae; in 1998, Pine Manor College cut its tuition by 34 percent after receiving a bequest of $4 million from Frances Crandall Dyke '25. Although this shift increased enrollment and brought the school praise and admiration, the school's financial endowment declined.Carmichael, Mary. \\"Educating the poor comes at a price for Pine Manor; Newton college looks to retool its finances,\\" The Boston Globe (December 23, 2011).Khadaroo, Stacy Teicher. \\"Difference Maker: How a college president toppled the ivory tower: Pine Manor College was once a haven for privileged white women. Now it's seeing a surge in low-income and minority students,\\" Christian Science Monitor (Dec. 13, 2010). In 2011, the college failed to meet the financial benchmarks required by its accreditation agency. Fiscal year 2012 ended with a $1.7 million deficit. In May 2013, the college sold 5.2 acres to New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady for $4.5 million to build his family home. The school had earlier sold off another acre for a home site. In September 2014, the college welcomed its first co-ed class, admitting men for the first time in its 103-year history. The following year, President E. Joseph Lee stepped down amidst reports of the school's financial difficulties and declining enrollment.Shannon McMahon. \\"Tom Brady's Hail Mary cash hasn‚Äôt saved this tiny college\\", Boston.com (July 16, 2015). In April 2016, the New England Association of Schools and Colleges placed Pine Manor on probation, risking the loss of its accreditation. President Tom O'Reilly took the helm in May 2016. One year later, the town of Brookline informed the college that they would be seeking to seize seven acres of the school's 52 acres under eminent domain for the building of an elementary school. In 2018, the New England Association of Schools and Colleges removed Pine Manor from probation, ensuring the college's continuous accreditation since it began offering degrees. In May 2019, Pine Manor College was recognized by NASPA and the Center for First-Generation Student Success for its commitment to serving first-generation college students. Academics Pine Manor College offers nine undergraduate majors. Upon graduation, students receive the Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Associate of Arts, or the Associate of Science. Since 2006, PMC has also offered a four-semester Master of Fine Arts in creative writing known as the Solstice Low-Residency MFA Program. In the low-residency format, students complete five 10-day, on-campus residencies and four semesters in which they work with their faculty mentors remotely from their homes. Residencies occur in January and July and start the spring and fall semesters, respectively. Solstice students may concentrate in fiction, creative nonfiction, poetry, comics & graphic narratives, or writing for children and young adults. The college hosts two English as a second or foreign language programs, which also serve as university pathways programs. Athletics Pine Manor is a Division III member of the NCAA. The college's athletic teams compete as NCAA independents and as members of the American Collegiate Athletic Association. Before the conference disbanded in 2016, its women's teams competed as members of the Great South Athletic Conference (GSAC). Before joining the GSAC in the spring of 2013, Pine Manor was a member of the Great Northeast Athletic Conference (GNAC) from 1995 to 2012. PMC offers women's athletics in the sports of basketball, cross country, softball, soccer, and volleyball. The college also previously fielded teams in women's tennis and lacrosse.

In 1980, he reorganized the group, expanding it and naming it The Great Eighties Eight. The band provided the unique backing that would come to be recognized by fans as \\"the Johnny Cash sound.\\" History Roy Cash, Sr., older brother of Johnny Cash, was service manager at an Automobile Sales Company dealership in Memphis, Tennessee. In 1953, while the younger Cash was stationed in Germany with the US Air Force, Luther Perkins joined the staff at Automobile Sales, where he met co-workers Marshall Grant and A.W. 'Red' Kernodle. Grant, Kernodle and Perkins began bringing their guitars to work, and would play together when repair business was slow. When Johnny Cash moved to Memphis after returning from Germany in 1954, Roy introduced him to Grant, Kernodle and Perkins. The four began to get together in the evenings at Perkins' or Grant's home and play songs. During this time they decided to form a band, with Grant moving to an upright bass, Kernodle to a six-string steel guitar, and Perkins buying a Fender Esquire electric guitar. Perkins' performance style on the Fender resulted in the band's famous steady, simple \\"boom-chicka-boom\\", or \\"freight train\\" rhythm. By 1955, Cash and his bandmates were in the Memphis studio of Sun Records, to audition for owner Sam Phillips. Kernodle was so nervous that he left the session, not wanting to hold back the group. The band presented themselves as the \\"Tennessee Three\\", but Phillips suggested that they call themselves Johnny Cash and the Tennessee Two. When Cash moved to Columbia Records in 1958, the group followed him. In 1960, drummer W.S. Holland joined the group, which was renamed The Tennessee Three. Holland has been credited as one of the first country music drummers. In the early 1950s, he had collaborated with Cash on recordings, as well as having played with Carl Perkins (no relation to Luther Perkins) and the \\"Perkins Brothers Band\\". In 1961, the group released two instrumental singles on Columbia recorded in 1959 (before Holland joined) as The Tennessee Two and Friend. The four songs would later be included in Cash's greatest hits collection More of Old Golden Throat. Luther Perkins died from injuries sustained in a house fire in August 1968, after reportedly having fallen asleep with a lit cigarette. Bob Wootton filled in as the group's guitarist at a performance the following month, and continued with the band. He participated in their landmark February 1969 performance with Cash at San Quentin State Prison, when the singer's live album was recorded. In 1971, the group recorded an instrumental album dedicated to Perkins: The Tennessee Three: The Sound Behind Johnny Cash. Through the 1970s, the Tennessee Three continued to work as Cash's studio and stage backing group. One major exception occurred in 1975 when Columbia Records, seeking to update Cash's sound, had the singer record an album with a new set of session musicians (including members of Elvis Presley's touring band), titled John R. Cash. This was the only major Cash recording of the era on which no member of the Tennessee Three participated. The album was unsuccessful. The next album released, Look at Them Beans, reinstated both the Tennessee Three as core session musicians and the accompanying Johnny Cash sound. In 1980, Cash fired Marshall Grant. He decided to discontinue using the name, \\"The Tennessee Three\\", ostensibly for legal reasons (Grant had filed a lawsuit against Cash, which was settled out-of-court years later). The reconstituted band was called The Great Eighties Eight after Grant left. Since that time, others joined the group, with Wootton and Holland remaining off- and-on as the group's anchors. In September 1989, Cash hired Kerry Marx and Steve Logan as guitarist and bassist, respectively, and renamed the group The Johnny Cash Show Band. By the early 1990s, the band consisted of Bob Wootton (guitar), W.S. Holland (drums), Dave Roe (upright bass), the singer's son John Carter Cash (rhythm guitar), and Earl Poole Ball (piano). This was the final configuration of the Johnny Cash Show Band until Cash's death in 2003. (Marty Stuart joined the group on guitar for a one-off performance of Cash's version of \\"Rusty Cage\\" on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno in 1996). The group made its final appearance backing Cash (with Marshall Grant in a surprise appearance on string bass) on April 6, 1999, while taping a TNT television special in New York City. After Cash's death, in 2006 then-manager Trevor Chowning revived the band's career. They recorded and released a tribute album to Johnny Cash titled The Sound Must Go On. In August 2007, the band made their first appearance in Scotland since the 1990s at the Belladrum Tartan Heart Festival, Inverness-shire. A planned Tennessee Three concert in January 2008, commemorating the 40th anniversary of Cash's Folsom Prison performance, was scrapped after disputes between prison managers and the concert promoter. In January 2008, Wootton announced on his mySpace page that Holland had decided against continued touring with him. He formed the \\"W.S. Holland band\\". In an interview, Wootton said that Holland had decided to dissolve the partnership after Wootton backed out of playing the Folsom anniversary concert. Wootton continued touring in 2008 as the Tennessee Three with drummer Rodney Blake Powell, and Vicky and Scarlett Wootton, to appreciative crowds across the globe. The band continued to tour throughout 2009, with the addition of upright bassist Lisa Horngren and drummer Derrick McCullough.\\"Johnny Cash's Legendary Band: The Tennessee 3 programme\\", 2010, the-ferry.co.uk In 2012, the band released another album, titled All Over Again. It includes a new song \\"How a Cowboy Has to Ride\\", written by Vicky Wootton.

True to their supposed characterizations described earlier, Perkins was played as stiff and expressionless onstage, while Grant was played as animated and gregarious: *Luther Perkins ‚Äì Dan John Miller *Marshall Grant ‚Äì Larry Bagby *W.S. Holland ‚Äì Clay Steakley The film contains a subtle foreshadowing of Perkins' fate, in a brief scene in which Perkins falls asleep with a lit cigarette in his mouth. Cash retrieves the cigarette and stubs it out. Cash later suggested that this was how Perkins's house had caught fire. Promotion for the DVD release of Walk the Line by FOX Television included a history-making screening of the film at Hollywood's famed Arclight Cinema wherein actors in the film and their real- life counterparts performed a set of Cash's music prior to the screening. Original Tennessee Three members, Bob Wootton and W. S. Holland were among those to perform as well as serve on a speaking panel after the film. Also in attendance was Jane Seymour, wife of the film's producer, James Keach.

J.\\" Hambro (5 January 1885 ‚Äì 15 December 1964) was a Norwegian journalist, author and leading politician representing the Conservative Party. A ten-term member of the Parliament of Norway, Hambro served as President of the Parliament for 20 of his 38 years in the legislature. He was actively engaged in international affairs, including work with the League of Nations (1939‚Äì1940), delegate to the UN General Assembly (1945‚Äì1956) and member of the Norwegian Nobel Committee (1940‚Äì1963). Personal life Carl Joachim Hambro's lineage can be traced back to Rendsburg in the 1720s. The family was Jewish. The family member Calmer Joachim Hambro (1747‚Äì1806) relocated to Copenhagen in the late 18th century, and became a businessman. One of his sons, Joseph Hambro, moved on to London and founded Hambros Bank with his son Carl Joachim Hambro. Another son (and Joseph's brother) Edvard Isaach Hambro (1782‚Äì1865) moved to Bergen, Norway where he became a merchant in the early 19th century. Edvard Isaach Hambro fathered Carl Joachim Hambro (1813‚Äì1873), who in turn fathered the school manager Edvard Isak Hambro (1847‚Äì1909). C. J. Hambro was born in Bergen as a son of Edvard Isak Hambro and Nicoline Christine Harbitz (1861‚Äì1926, later known as Nico Hambro). He had three sisters, among them the educator Elise Hambro. He was a distant descendant of Johan Randulf Bull, and thereby a first cousin of Edvard Bull, Sr., Johan Peter Bull and Francis Bull. From June 1910, C. J. Hambro was married to priest's daughter Gudrun \\"Dudu\\" Grieg (1881‚Äì1943). They had the sons Edvard Hambro, Vilhelm Cato Grieg Hambro, Carl Joachim Hambro and Johan Randulf Bull Hambro and one daughter; all born between 1911 and 1915. Through Edvard, he was also a grandfather of Christian Hambro. Three years after his wife died, in February 1946, C. J. Hambro married actress Gyda Christensen (1872‚Äì1964) whom he had befriended in 1918. Early career Hambro attended the middle school and high school his father had founded in Bergen. He took the examen artium in 1902, and enrolled in philology studies at the Royal Frederick University. While studying, he took many excursions, working as translator, literary critic, part-time teacher and even participant on the research vessel Michael Sars. He was also a journalist in Morgenbladet, from 1903 to 1907. He finally received his cand.mag. degree in 1907. He was involved in the Norwegian Students' Society, which he chaired in 1908, 1909 and in the autumn of 1911. He chaired the Conservative Students' Association in 1908, 1910 and 1911, and was also vice chairman of Filologisk Forening in 1904. From 1910 to 1913 he was the secretary of the Norse Federation, and edited its periodical from 1911 to 1916. He was also involved in association football, chairing the club Akademisk FK and being vice chairman (in 1904) of the fledgling Football Association of Norway. After graduating from the university, he was a teacher at Kristiania Commerce School (1907) and Vestheim School (1908‚Äì1912). In 1913 he became chief editor of the conservative newspaper Morgenbladet, a post he held until 1919. He then focused on pursuing a political career, having been elected in the autumn of 1918. He returned to the press as editor of the magazine Ukens Revy from 1921 to 1929. Ukens Revy had been distinctively pro-German and anti-British during the First World War. During the war, Hambro got entangled in British affairs. In January 1917, the United Kingdom had ceased its coal exports to Norway. During the negotiations between Knudsen's Cabinet's representatives and the British legation in Kristiania, Hambro wrote an editorial in Morgenbladet which suggested expulsion of the British diplomats if Norwegian needs were not met. British Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour met with the Norwegian ambassador in the UK, and demanded that Knudsen's Cabinet either deplore Morgenbladet's statements or prosecute Hambro legally. Hambro's actions were defended by the Norwegian parliamentary opposition, including the Conservative Party. After some rounds of talks and negotiations, the whole case blew over. In the first phase of the First World War, Hambro had campaigned restlessly against Knudsen's Cabinet which he perceived as too weak to lead the country through a war. Hambro and Morgenbladet was joined in this endeavor by Tidens Tegn and to an extent Aftenposten. Prime Minister Gunnar Knudsen summoned a sitdown of himself and the three newspaper's editors, where he tried to calm their attacks. \\"The attempt failed completely\\", notes historian Hans Fredrik Dahl.Dahl, 1981: p. 70 Hambro also marked himself as a critic of socialism. He reacted strongly against the antimilitaristic policies of the socialists in Norway, and called for reactions against those who spread such \\"contamination\\" in print. In 1918, in the wake of the Russian Revolution, Hambro suggested that the revolutionary socialist press be met with harsher regulations. He wrote in Morgenbladet: \\"Perhaps our authorities should be more attentive towards the socially subversive agitation long practiced by our socialist leaders in writing and speech\\".Dahl and Bastiansen, 2000: p. 50 On the other hand, he also criticized cases of actual censorship directed towards the workers' movement, among others during the secret military expedition to quell calamities in Rjukan in May 1914.Ag√∏y, 1997: p. 43 He chaired the boards of the Conservative Press Association from 1913 to 1920, Ukens Revy from 1919 to 1929, the Norwegian News Agency from 1920 to 1946 (vice chairman 1918 to 1920), and the Norse Federation from 1923 to 1946 (board member 1913 to 1915, vice chairman 1915 to 1923). He was the vice chairman of Det Nye Teater from 1928 to 1932, a board member of Morgenbladet from 1921 to 1933 as well as of the Institute for Comparative Research in Human Culture. He was a supervisory council member of Nationaltheatret. Political career Hambro had settled in Kristiania (Oslo), and in 1908 he became a board member of the Conservative Party there. He was selected as a member of Kristiania's school board in 1913. In 1921 he advanced to chairman, a post he held until 1923. In the 1918 Norwegian parliamentary election he stood on the Conservative Party ballot in Uranienborg and was elected to the Parliament of Norway in that single-member constituency. He was nominated as the party's candidate in Uranienborg as a compromise candidate between the agrarian-conservative wing of Jens Bratlie and the liberal wing of Fredrik Stang, Nils Yngvar Ustvedt and Edvard Hagerup Bull (Bratlie, Stang and Ustvedt were former MPs from Uranienborg). Hambro received 14,501 votes, and thus won a landslide victory. The closest runner-up was G. E. Stubber√∏d of Labour, who tallied only 1,504 votes. After the change to plural-member constituencies Hambro was re-elected to Parliament from the constituency Kristiania in 1921, and, after it changed its name to Oslo, in 1924, 1927, 1930, 1933, 1936, 1945, 1949 and 1953. He was a member of Parliament from 1919 to 1957; amounting to ten consecutive terms in total (the 1940 election was called off because of World War II). C. J. Hambro served as President of the Parliament from 30 June 1926 to 10 January 1934 and from 21 March 1935 to 3 December 1945, and President of the Assembly of the League of Nations delegates in 1939‚Äì40 and 1946.Carl Joachim Hambro, Politician, Journalist and Writer (Nobelprize.org) He had originally voted against Norway's accession to the League of Nations, as one of only three representatives from his party to do so, citing that the Versailles Treaty did not create decent grounds for such an international organization. He chaired the Standing Committee on Foreign and Constitutional Affairs from 1925 to 1945, and was then a member from 1945 to 1957. From 1945 to 1957 he was also a member of the Enlarged Committee on Foreign and Constitutional Affairs. In the Election Committee of the Parliament, he was the chairman from 1928 to 1945 and deputy chairman from 1945 to 1957. C. J. Hambro served as acting party chairman in 1926, and party chairman from 1928 to 1934 and 1945 to 1954. He was also a central board member from 1934 to 1964. He was never a member of any government, despite that his party formed several cabinet during his parliamentary tenure. He instead chose to work as chairman of his party as well as its parliamentary group; the two posts had actually become open to him when Ivar Lykke chose to form his cabinet in 1926. =Views= Hambro was known as a cosmopolite. He did not follow the group Fedrelandslaget, which was vying for conservative support, in their nationalism. In the so-called \\"Greenland Question\\", he arbitrated with Denmark in 1923‚Äì1924 when Denmark claimed sovereignty over Greenland, and had meant that Denmark acted unjustified. However, when forces in and outside of the then-Agrarian government annexed \\"Erik the Red's Land\\" in 1931, Hambro was strictly against it. The Agrarian Party revenged itself on Hambro by voting him down as President of the Parliament in 1934, but Hambro won support from the adversaries in the Labour Party to regain the post. He nurtured a personal friendship with figures such as the Labour Party's foremost politician, Johan Nygaardsvold. Despite his family's Jewish roots, Hambro was a Christian. He more or less adhered to the views of the Oxford Group, without being an actual member of this group. He famously invited the Oxford Group's founder, Frank Buchman, and a large party of Oxford Group members to Norway in 1934 where they led a massive campaign for \\"a Christian revolution\\" leading to a kind of \\"national awakening\\" credited with strengthening Norwegian spirit of resistance during World War II.Lean, Frank Buchman,, Constable, London, 1985, 590 pages, , pp. 216-232. =Role in World War II= Hambro played a crucial role at the time of the German invasion of Norway on 9 April 1940. He was one of the few politicians who really understood Hitler's ambitions toward the country. Learning from what had happened to Czechoslovakia in 1938, Hambro was prepared, and with only six hours advance notice, he managed to organize the escape of King Haakon and his royal family, the government, prominent members of Parliament and the gold reserves of the Bank of Norway. They all left on a train commissioned by Hambro just 30 minutes before the Germans arrived in Oslo. The Germans had then been delayed by the sinking of the German cruiser Bl√ºcher.Norway after 1905 (Royal Norwegian Embassy in Washington) In the days after the invasion, Hambro worked actively from Sweden's capital Stockholm to correct the image the American journalist Leland Stowe had portrayed of the situation in Norway. While in Sweden, Hambro also was instrumental in organizing the fledgling Norwegian underground resistance movement via telephone. =Post-war life= After the Second World War, he was a delegate to the United Nations General Assembly from 1945 to 1956. He was a member of the Norwegian Nobel Committee from 1940 to 1963. Legacy Hambro was a member of the Norwegian Academy for Language and Literature. His most prestigious awards were the Grand Cross of the Order of St. Olav in 1937 and the Medal for Outstanding Civic Service in 1952. He also got the Grand Cross of the Order of the White Rose of Finland, the Haakon VII 70th Anniversary Medal and the St. Olav's Medal. When he died in December 1964, he received a state funeral in the honorary section of V√•r Frelsers gravlund. He has a square in the centre of Oslo named after him, C. J. Hambros plass, in which are sited both the Oslo District Court and the National Authority for Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime in Norway. Streets have been named after him in Heimdal and Fyllingsdalen (C. J. Hambros vei) as well as Elverum (C. J. Hambros veg). A statue of him was erected in 1995 at the square in front of the Parliament, Eidsvolls plass.

Joseph Lambert Massart (19 July 1811 - 13 February 1892) was a Belgian violinist who has been credited with the origination of the systematic vibrato. He compiled The Art of Working at Kreutzer's Etudes, a supplement that contains 412 fingerings and bowings taken from his time studying with Rodolphe Kreutzer. He was an excellent String quartet player who gave many delightful chamber concerts, having also played Beethoven's Kreutzer Sonata in A minor with Franz Liszt on 23 May 1843. Biography Massart was born in Li√®ge, and was taught music first by his father Joseph Marie and later by his father's eldest brother Jean-Joseph, a disciple of Leonard-Joseph Gaillard. With the death of his uncle, Massart studied under the guidance of Ambroise Delaveux who then secured for him, from the local authorities of Li√®ge, a scholarship at the Conservatoire de Paris, where his admission was then blocked by Luigi Cherubini on the grounds that Massart was a foreigner. He became then the favorite pupil and prot√©g√© of Kreutzer and his younger brother, Auguste Kreutzer, who took his brother's post as professor at the conservatory upon his death. Despite being sponsored by King William I of the Netherlands, he was not accepted at the Conservatoire de Paris until 1829 because of his foreign status. He was appointed professor of violin at the Conservatoire de Paris in 1843 and subsequently taught there for 47 years as music professor. Among his pupils were Fritz Kreisler, Eug√®ne Ysa√øe, L√©on Reynier, Henryk Wieniawski, Alfred De S√®ve, Isidor Lotto, Teresina Tua, and Charles Martin Loeffler.

No Direction Home: The Life and Music of Bob Dylan. 1986, , pp. 436-437. To compile the album, recordings were taken from the final three shows at the Los Angeles Forum in Inglewood, California, with only \\"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\\" from New York.Bjorner's Files Still on the Road The title of the album is thought to derive from the novel Farn Mabul by Yiddish writer Sholem Asch; Dylan had a personal relationship with Moses Asch, son of Sholem and founder of Folkways Records, a record label hugely influential in the folk music revival. Another theory is that the title refers to the album arriving before the inevitable flood of bootlegs could saturate the underground market. While Dylan and the Band had recorded the studio album Planet Waves prior to the tour, few of its songs were incorporated into the tour's setlist, and none are represented on Before the Flood. After the double album release, Dylan signed a new contract with Columbia Records in time for his next studio album, Blood on the Tracks, after returning label president Goddard Lieberson made a determined campaign to get Dylan back from Asylum.Shelton, p. 378. The Band continued to record on their own for Capitol Records. Subsequent reissues were on the Columbia imprint, and on March 31, 2009, a remastered digipak version of Before the Flood was issued by Legacy Recordings/Columbia, now part of Sony Music Entertainment. Critical reception In a contemporary review for Creem magazine, Robert Christgau felt that the Band followed Dylan in intensifying his old songs for the arena venue and stated, \\"Without qualification, this is the craziest and strongest rock and roll ever recorded. All analogous live albums fall flat.\\" In a less enthusiastic review, Rolling Stone magazine's Tom Nolan said Dylan's vocal emphasis and the Band's busy arrangements make for an awkward listen, although revamped versions of songs such as \\"It's All Right, Ma\\", \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\", and \\"All Along the Watchtower\\" are successful and sound meaningful. Before the Flood was voted the sixth best album of 1974, in The Village Voices annual Pazz & Jop critics poll. Christgau, the poll's creator, ranked it second on his own list. In a retrospective review, Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune called the album \\"epochal\\", while AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine described it as \\"one of the best live albums of its time. Ever, maybe.\\" Greil Marcus commented, \\"Roaring with resentment and happiness, the music touched rock and roll at its limits.\\" By contrast, Dylan himself later disparaged the tour, feeling that it was overblown. \\"I think I was just playing a role on that tour, I was playing Bob Dylan and the Band were playing the Band. It was all sort of mindless. The only thing people talked about was energy this, energy that. The highest compliments were things like, 'Wow, lotta energy, man.' It had become absurd.\\"Dylan, Bob, in conversation with Cameron Crowe. Biograph. 1985, Columbia Records C5X 38830 vinyl edition, liner notes, p. 22. In a retrospective review, Scott Hreha from PopMatters also felt that each act did not sound collaborative as on The Basement Tapes and that the album \\"remains a worthy but inessential item in Dylan's catalog‚Äîand both he and the Band have better live recordings available, especially the several volumes in Dylan's Bootleg Series.\\" Track listing Sides one and four are performances by Bob Dylan backed by the Band; side two and tracks four through six on side three are by the Band; tracks one through three on side three by Dylan alone. \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\" is a splice of two separate performances.

Background and education Born in London, Stanhope was the second son of Philip Stanhope, 5th Earl Stanhope, by his wife Emily Harriet, daughter of General Sir Edward Kerrison, 1st Baronet. Arthur Stanhope, 6th Earl Stanhope was his elder brother and Philip Stanhope, 1st Baron Weardale his younger brother. He was educated at Harrow and Christ Church, Oxford. Stanhope studied law, being called to the bar at the Inner Temple in 1865. In 1861 he played three first-class cricket matches for Kent. Political career Spy published in Vanity Fair in 1879. In 1874 Stanhope was elected to the House of Commons for Mid Lincolnshire, a seat he held until 1885, and then represented Horncastle until his death. He soon rose to a position of prominence within the party. In 1875, he became Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade, and in 1878 moved up to Under-Secretary of State for India, where he was a key assistant to India Secretary Lord Cranbrook. After the Tories' fall from power in 1880, Stanhope supported Commons leader Sir Stafford Northcote against younger Tories led by Lord Randolph Churchill in internal Conservative party squabbling. When the Conservatives returned to the power, Stanhope became Vice-President of the Committee of Council on Education, with a seat in the cabinet, and almost immediately thereafter President of the Board of Trade. He moved up to major cabinet office in Salisbury's second government, serving first as Colonial Secretary from 1886 to 1887 and then as Secretary of State for War from 1887 to 1892 following a cabinet reshuffle in January 1887. As War Secretary, Stanhope fought for reform against the reactionary high officers ‚Äì most notably the Duke of Cambridge, the Commander in Chief, and Sir Garnet Wolseley, the Adjutant-General. In spite of his own inexperience in military affairs and this formidable opposition, Stanhope achieved a fair amount, although it was his Liberal successor, Henry Campbell-Bannerman, who managed to push Cambridge into retirement. Personal life In December 1893, Stanhope died suddenly of a heart attack, aged 53. The school house 'Stanhope' at Alderwood School in the garrison town of Aldershot in Hampshire is named in his honour.

The university enrolls approximately 7,000 students and is a member of the University System of Georgia and the Council of Public Liberal Arts Colleges. Georgia College was designated Georgia's \\"Public Liberal Arts University\\" in 1996 by the Georgia Board of Regents. Students pursue majors and graduate degree programs throughout the university's four colleges: College of Arts & Sciences, J. Whitney Bunting College of Business, John H. Lounsbury College of Education, and College of Health Sciences. Georgia College Athletics' 11 teams compete in the NCAA Division II Peach Belt Conference.  History  Georgia College was chartered in 1889 as Georgia Normal and Industrial College. Its emphasis at the time was largely vocational, and its major task was to prepare young women for teaching or industrial careers. In 1917, in keeping with economic and cultural changes in the state, Georgia Normal and Industrial College was authorized to grant 4-year degrees, the first of which was awarded in 1921. In 1922, the institution's name was changed to Georgia State College for Women. The university has been a unit of the University System of Georgia since the system's founding in 1932. Mary \\"Flannery\\" O'Connor entered as a freshman in 1942. Active in student publications, she graduated three years later and became one of the South‚Äôs most noted writers. Also during World War II, Georgia State College for Women served as one of four colleges that trained WAVES for the U.S. Navy. After the war, enrollment declined as women preferred co-educational colleges. The name was changed to Woman's College of Georgia in 1961, and, when the institution became coeducational in 1967, it became Georgia College at Milledgeville. The name was shortened to Georgia College in 1971. In August 1996, the Board of Regents approved a change of name to Georgia College & State University, and a new mission as Georgia's Public Liberal Arts University.  Campus  Terrell Hall The central campus comprises about 43.2 acres (174,000 m2) in the center of Milledgeville, near the grounds of the former state capitol. The campus contains buildings of red brick and white Corinthian columns, representative of those constructed during the pre-Civil War Antebellum period, when Milledgeville was the capital of Georgia. Bell Hall and Russell Auditorium are credited to architect J. Reginald MacEachron. Atkinson Hall (1896) is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Other historic buildings on the campus include Sanford Hall (1938), Russell Auditorium (1926), Ina Dillard Russell Art Museum (the original section of the library) (1932), Chappell Hall (1963) (on the site of an earlier Chappell Hall built in 1907), Parks Hall (1911), Terrell Hall (1908), Maxwell Student Union (1972), Beeson Hall (1937), Porter Hall (1939), Lanier Hall (1926), Ennis Hall (1920), and Herty Hall (1954 and expanded in 1972).Name origins and brief histories of Georgia College buildings Georgia College Buildings Most of the university's residence halls are located a block from central campus along with the sports complex, called the Centennial Center. The Old Governor's Mansion is also within walking distance of the residence halls and front campus. West Campus, a 500-acre (2 km¬≤) extension from the central campus, contains The Village student apartments and athletic fields. In addition, GC operates a large recreational area on Lake Laurel (approximately 15 minutes from the central campus) which is used by students in the university's Environmental Science and Outdoor Education programs. The university library houses the manuscript collection of author Flannery O'Connor, an alumna of the university, and of U.S. Senator Paul Coverdell, whose career included serving as director of the Peace Corps when the Berlin Wall fell.

Early and family life  She was the daughter of the poet William Butler Yeats and Georgie Hyde-Lees, a niece of the painter Jack B. Yeats, and of Lily Yeats and of Elizabeth Corbet Yeats. Her aunts were associated with the arts and crafts movement in Ireland and were associated with the Dun Emer Press, Cuala Press, and Dun Emer industries. Her brother Michael Yeats was a politician. She was known as \\"feathers\\" by her family. Born in Dublin on 26 February 1919, her birth was commemorated by her father with the poem A Prayer for My Daughter. Anne Yeats spent her first 3 years between Ballylee County Galway and Oxford before her family moved to 82 Merrion Square, Dublin in 1922. She was very sick as a child. She spent three years in two different hospitals. St. Margaret's Hall, 50 Mespil Rd, and Nightingale Hall, Morehampton Rd Dublin. She then went to the Pension Henriette, a boarding school in Villars-sur-Bex, Switzerland from 1928‚Äì1930. In 1923 her Aunt Elizabeth \\"Lolly\\" gave her brush drawing lessons which aided her in winning first prize in the RDS National Art competition for children under eight years old in 1925 and 1926.  Theatre work  She trained in the Royal Hibernian Academy school from 1933 to 1936, and worked as a stage designer with the Abbey Theatre in Dublin. At the age of 16, she was hired by the Abbey Theatre in 1936 as assistant to Tanya Moiseiwitsch. She studied for four months at the School of Theatrical Design in Paris with Paul Colin in 1937. At 18, she began her costume career on sets with Ria Mooney's company. At the Abbey, she designed the sets and costumes for revivals of W.B. Yeats' plays The resurrection and On Baile's strand (1938). In 1938 she designed the first production of W.B. Yeats' play Purgatory. The designs for Purgatory were her most successful achievement. \\"My daughter's designs for [Cuchulain] and Purgatory -especially Purgatory were greatly admired\\" quoted by W.B Yeats. Purgatory was the last play that W.B Yeats saw on stage, and when it was performed it was a full house. When working on Purgatory, Hugh Hunt wanted to have a moon on the back cloth of the production but Anne Yeats refused. \\"If she does not win, she is going to say that she doesn't wish to have her name on the programme as a designer of the setting.\\" This could be the main reason why her name is not on many productions that she had worked on. Anne Yeats also designed the first play of her uncle Jack Yeats to receive professional production, Harlequin's Positions. In 1939 she was promoted to head of design at the Abbey until her departure in May 1941. In 1939 it was commented that her designs were \\"getting arty\\" and not in keeping with style of the Abbey. One of her last designs was her father's last play, The Death of Cuchulain for the Lyric Theatre on the Abbey stage, in 1949. She designed and stage-managed for The Peacock, The Cork Opera House, The Olympia, The Gaiety Theatre, the Austin Clarke Lyric Theatre, the Abbey Theatre and Player's Theatre. Among the work Yeats is credited with in the Abbey Theatre, she is also recorded as having worked on 5 productions in the Peacock Theatre with the Theatre Company: *Alarm Among the Clerks (1937) *The Phoenix (1937) *Harlequin's Positions (1939) *The Wild Cat (1940) *Cavaliero (The Life of a Hawk) (1948)  Painting career  She chose to move towards painting full-time beginning a brief study at the Dublin Metropolitan School of Art in 1941. She experimented with watercolour and wax. She had a touching naive expressionist style and was interested in representing domestic humanity. She designed many of the covers for the books of Irish-language publisher S√°irs√©al agus Dill over a twenty- year period from 1958. She did illustrations for books by Denis Devlin, Thomas Kinsella and Louis MacNeice, and worked with many young designers, such as Louis LeBrocquy.  Death and legacy  The Royal Hibernian Academy held a retrospective of her work in 1995, as did the National Gallery of Ireland in 2002. She donated her collection of Jack B. Yeats' sketch books to the National Gallery of Ireland, leading to the creation of the Yeats Museum within the Gallery. Her brother, Michael, in turn, donated her sketchbooks to the Museum.

It is considered to be outdoor music, while the related kulintang ensemble, by contrast, is chamber music. The main instrument of tagonggo music is the tagunggoan, from which it takes its name. The tagunggoan consists of six to eight hanging gongs in a pentatonic scale. In addition, the instrumental ensemble consists of a number of medium-sized gongs called mamalala; a number of small, high pitched, and shallow gongs called pong; one or more tambor (snare drums); and one or more garagara or panda'opan (cymbals). The last two are either of Chinese or European origin. Tagonggo is associated with the Sama, Bajau, and Tausug ethnicities of the Sulu archipelago. Occasions or purposes for playing tagonggo include sending off or welcoming dignitaries, honorific serving of betelquid, and wedding celebrations. Tagonggo players go at the head of the parade either on foot or aboard a vehicle or motorboat. Tagonggo is also played in ceremonies called kalilang sa tong to appeal to the spirits for a bountiful harvest or for a rich catch of fish. References See also: The Maranao Man.

During his time at university he participated in Varsity Matches in five sports: cricket (1876‚Äì79), football (1876‚Äì78), athletics (1876) (he was selected to throw the hammer), rackets (1877‚Äì79) and real tennis (1877‚Äì79), displaying an ability that made him arguably the pre-eminent sportsman of his generation; his only rival in terms of versatility was Oxford's Cuthbert Ottaway. He was, among numerous other achievements, the first man to represent England at both football and cricket. Lyttelton was also a successful politician and served as Secretary of State for the Colonies between 1903 and 1905. Background and education Lyttelton was the twelfth and youngest child of George Lyttelton, 4th Baron Lyttelton, by his first wife Mary, daughter of Sir Stephen Glynne, 8th Baronet. Charles Lyttelton, 8th Viscount Cobham, Sir Neville Lyttelton and the Right Reverend Arthur Lyttelton were his elder brothers and Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone an uncle by marriage. Another relative was his great-nephew, the jazz trumpeter Humphrey Lyttelton. Lyttelton was educated at Eton ‚Äì where he was President of Pop ‚Äì and Trinity College, Cambridge. At Cambridge, he was a member of the University Pitt Club and played for Cambridge against Oxford in the Real Tennis Varsity Match.1879https://www.tennisandrackets.com/downloads/TennisResults/OxfordandCambridgeDoubles.pdf Cricketing career Lyttelton played first-class cricket for Cambridge University, captaining the side in 1879. After going down from university he represented Middlesex, where he was a noted wicket-keeper. In the course of his cricketing career, Lyttelton accumulated a total of 4,429 first-class runs at an average of 27.85, scoring seven centuries. As a wicket-keeper, he held 134 catches and stumped 70. He ranked third in the national first-class averages in 1879 with 688 runs at 28.66. While turning out for Middlesex he also represented Worcestershire (1874‚Äì85), which was not then a first-class county. In the early 1880s Lyttelton played four Test matches against Australia, the most notable of which was that contested at The Oval in 1884. In the course of this game, Australia reached a total ‚Äì all but unheard-of at the time ‚Äì of 500 for six and the England captain, Lord Harris, grew so desperate for a breakthrough that he asked his wicket-keeper, Lyttelton, to bowl. W. G. Grace kept wicket while Lyttelton sent down a succession of underarm lobs, succeeding, remarkably, in taking the last four Australian wickets for only 19 runs in the course of a dozen four ball overs. He was President of Marylebone Cricket Club in 1898. Footballing career Edward at Eton, circa 1872 Lyttelton was also a keen and skilful footballer, playing for Cambridge and Old Etonians and winning a single cap for England against Scotland on 3 March 1877. As a university player, Lyttelton's most notable achievement was the hat-trick he scored in helping Cambridge to a 5‚Äì1 victory over Oxford in 1878. As a club player, he turned out for Etonians in the FA Cup final of 1876, a match the team lost, after a replay, to Royal Engineers. As an international, he scored the only goal in England's 1‚Äì3 defeat by Scotland in 1877. He was, a contemporary assessment in the Football Annual noted, \\"a very strong and fast forward, a splendid shot at goal, and perhaps the most dangerous forward out.\\" Lyttelton's brother, Edward ‚Äì a fellow England international ‚Äì wrote in a private memoir: > There have been other players more deft at dribbling, there have been a few, > very few, of greater speed, and there have been heavier players, but I never > knew one who combined the three great essentials, and added to them a > surprising accuracy at kicking goals and \\"bunting\\" his opponents. This last > faculty he exercised by dint of a jerk of his hips, not as ordinarily by > lowering the shoulder, and so the aggressor could see no sign of the > terrific impact coming. Once playing against Royal Engineers I saw him make > a run down from one end of the field to the other and floor four men on the > way ‚Äì the last two having charged him simultaneously from both sides, and > both rebounding on their backs ‚Äì and shoot the goal at the end. Lyttelton's principal weapon as a forward was a unique and generally successful goalscoring technique that appears, from contemporary sources, to have been an early version of the 1970s Cruyff turn. Edward Lyttelton explained: > He would run towards the corner and then swiftly turn inwards, running > parallel to the back line, and some ten yards from it. At this point he was > pursued probably by three of the opponents, barely keeping up. This > continued till he got opposite the further goal post, and then one huge foot > was smartly dropped on the ball, stopping it dead, and of course the > pursuers all ran a yard or so too far, not suspecting the sudden pull up; > thus he had a clear shot at the goal. Lyttelton played in the last days of the \\"dribbling game\\", the earliest form of the Association code and a style of play that valued individualism and close ball control over passing and teamwork. In his solitary international his England teammates were highly critical of his attempts to dribble through the entire Scotland defence by himself, and Billy Mosforth, the Sheffield player, ventured to draw his colleague's attention to this failing. He was silenced by an imperious put-down that has been cited as exemplifying the attitude of the earliest amateurs: \\"I play,\\" the unabashed Lyttelton said back, \\"for my own pleasure.\\" Professional and public career On coming down from Cambridge, Lyttelton took up the law, and served as legal private secretary to the Attorney General, Sir Henry James. He remained apolitical until his uncle's retirement, but in 1894 entered politics as a Liberal Unionist, and was elected to the House of Commons at the 1895 general election as Member of Parliament for Warwick and Leamington. In January 1900 he was appointed a Queen's Counsel, and later that year he was sent by Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain to South Africa as chairman of the committee planning reconstruction following the Boer War, a position in which he impressed South African High Commissioner Alfred Milner. Upon Chamberlain's resignation, Lyttelton succeeded him as Colonial Secretary, despite his relative political inexperience. His decision to allow Chinese indentured labour into South Africa proved highly controversial and became a major issue for the Liberals in the 1906 election. Lyttelton also attempted ambitious reforms of Britain's management of the colonies towards a more decentralised, imperial vision, but these ideas were abandoned by the Liberals who succeeded him. After the Conservatives' fall from power, Lyttelton remained active politically, opposing Welsh disestablishment and supporting women's suffrage. In the summer of 1913, he was struck in the belly during a cricket match in South Africa. Shortly after his return to Britain, he was taken ill at the Foreign Office and an operation revealed the presence of an abscess in his stomach. Surgery was unsuccessful and he died, in a nursing home, early in July. His funeral took place on the day of the annual Varsity cricket match, and play between Oxford and Cambridge was suspended for two minutes as a mark of respect. Family St John the Baptist Church, Hagley, grave of Alfred Lyttelton, where also the 1st Viscount Chandos' ashes are interred. Lyttelton and both his wives were members of the intellectual group known as The Souls. In 1885 he married Octavia Laura, daughter of Sir Charles Tennant, 1st Baronet. The couple lived at 4 Upper Brook Street, Mayfair. Laura, as she was usually known, was born in 1862 and died in 1886, within days of giving birth to their only child, a son, who died in 1888. Edward Burne-Jones designed her memorial in St Andrew's Church, Mells and, also in her memory, used her features for the mermaid in his 1886 painting The Depths of the Sea. Lyttelton married secondly Edith Sophy, daughter of Archibald Balfour, in 1892. They had two sons (one of whom died as an infant) and one daughter. His elder son Oliver became a prominent politician and businessman, being created Viscount Chandos in 1954. Lyttelton died in July 1913, aged 56. His second wife survived him by over thirty years and died in September 1948. Bibliography * Warsop, Keith (2004). The Early F.A.

It is located on the River Emmer, about 10 km west of the Weser. Bad Pyrmont is a popular spa resort that gained its reputation as a fashionable place for princely vacations in the 17th and 18th centuries. The town is also the center of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) in Germany. History Formerly called Pyrmont, it was the seat of a small county during much of the Middle Ages. The county gained its independence from the County of Schwalenberg in 1194. Independence was maintained until the extinction of the comital line in 1494, when the county was inherited by the County of Spiegelberg. In 1557, the county was inherited by Lippe, then by the County of Gleichen in 1583. In 1625, the county became part of the much larger County of Waldeck through inheritance. In 1668, the Reichskammergericht ruled against the Bishopric of Paderborn's claims that Pyrmont had been collateral in a loan, confirming the Count of Waldeck's rights over Pyrmont, who ceded the Amt of L√ºgde ‚Äî previously the county's capital ‚Äî to the bishopric in compensation. In January 1712, the Count of Waldeck and Pyrmont was elevated to hereditary prince by Emperor Charles VI, the count having combined the two titles the previous year. For a brief period, from 1805 to 1812, Pyrmont was again a separate principality as a result of inheritance and partition after the death of the previous prince, but the two parts were united again in 1812. The principality of Waldeck-Pyrmont retained its status after the Congress of Vienna of 1815 and became a member of the German Confederation. In 1813, the inhabitants of Pyrmont began to protest at their lack of autonomy within Waldeck‚ÄìPyrmont and the separate constitutional nature of the two territories was confirmed the following year, until a formal union was established in 1849. From 1868 onward, the principality was administered by Prussia, but retained its legislative sovereignty. Prussian administration served to reduce administrative costs for the small state and was based on a ten-year contract that was repeatedly renewed. In 1871 it became a constituent state of the new German Empire. At the end of World War I, during the German Revolution the prince abdicated and Waldeck‚ÄìPyrmont became a free state within the Weimar Republic. On 30 November 1921, following a local plebiscite, the town and district of Pyrmont were detached and incorporated into the Prussian Province of Hanover, with Waldeck following into the Prussian province of Hesse-Nassau in 1929. Economy As a spa town, Bad Pyrmont's economy is heavily geared towards tourism. Bad Pyrmonter mineral water is bottled in Bad Pyrmont. Attractions Bad Pyrmont features a large Kurpark, with a sizeable outdoor palm garden. The Baroque castle (1706‚Äì10) is part of a substantial complex of fortifications dating from the 16th century. The castle now houses the Museum of Municipal and Spa History. Unique in Europe is the vapor cave, where therapeutic carbon dioxide vapors emerge from the earth.

In 2001, Human Rights Watch estimated that at least 4.3 million inmates had been raped while incarcerated in the United States. A United States Department of Justice report, Sexual Victimization in Prisons and Jails Reported by Inmates, states that \\"In 2011‚Äì12, an estimated 4.0% of state and federal prison inmates and 3.2% of jail inmates reported experiencing one or more incidents of sexual victimization by another inmate or facility staff in the past 12 months or since admission to the facility, if less than 12 months.\\" However, advocates dispute the accuracy of the numbers, saying they seem to under-report the real numbers of sexual assaults in prison, especially among juveniles. A meta-analysis published in 2004 found a prevalence rate of 1.91% with a 95% confidence interval between 1.37 and 2.46%.Gerald G. Gaes; Andrew L. Goldberg: Prison Rape: A Critical Review of the Literature, Executive Summary. 2004 In a survey of 1,788 male inmates in Midwestern prisons by Prison Journal, about 21% claimed they had been coerced or pressured into sexual activity during their incarceration, and 7% claimed that they had been raped in their current facility. According to the study conducted by the United States Department of Justice for the year 2006, there were 2,205 allegations of inmate-on-inmate non-consensual sexual acts reported in the U.S. prison system, 262 of which were substantiated.Devon B. Adams, Allen J. Beck, Paige M. Harrison Sexual Violence Reported by Correctional Authorities, 2006 . Bureau of Justice Statistics. August 16, 2007  Statistics  Research has shown that juveniles incarcerated with adults are five times more likely to report being victims of sexual assault than youth in juvenile facilities, and the suicide rate of juveniles in adult jails is 7.7 times higher than that of juvenile detention centers.The Basics on Rape Behind Bars. spr.org In the United States, public awareness of the phenomenon of prison rape is a relatively recent development and estimates to its prevalence have varied widely for decades. In 1974 Carl Weiss and David James Friar wrote that 46 million Americans would one day be incarcerated; of that number, they claimed, 10 million would be raped. A 1992 estimate from the Federal Bureau of Prisons conjectured that between 9 and 20 percent of inmates had been sexually assaulted. Studies in 1982 and 1996 both concluded that the rate was somewhere between 12 and 14 percent; the 1996 study, by Cindy Struckman-Johnson, concluded that 18 percent of assaults were carried out by prison staff. A 1986 study by Daniel Lockwood put the number at around 23 percent for maximum security prisons in New York. Christine Saum's 1994 survey of 101 inmates showed 5 had been sexually assaulted. Reported prison rape cases have drastically risen in recent years, although this may be partially attributed to an increase in counseling and reports. The threat of HIV, which affects many of those raped in prison, has also resulted in the increase of reported cases for the benefit of medical assistance. According to one source, female- perpetrated sexual abuse of inmates is a particularly large problem in juvenile detention centers, where 90% of victims of staff abuse say a female correctional officer was the perpetrator. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, around 80,000 women and men a year get sexually abused in American correctional facilities. The National Inmate Survey presented data that consisted of 233 state and federal prisons, 358 local jails, and fifteen special correctional facilities between the time period of February 2011 and May 2012, with a sample of 92,449 inmates ages eighteen or older, and 1,738 inmates sixteen to seventeen. The statistical information highlighted that an estimated of 4.0% of state and federal prison inmates and 3.2% of jail inmates reported experiencing one or more incidents of sexual victimization by another inmate or facility staff since their admission to the facility or in the past twelve months since the survey was executed. More specifically, around 29,300 prisoners reported an incident regarding another inmate, 34,100 prisoners reported an incident involving staff that worked at the facility, and 5,500 inmates reported an incident involving both. Rates reported by female inmates were higher than male inmates, higher among African American inmates than Caucasian inmates, and lower among inmates ages thirty-five or older than inmates ages twenty to twenty-four. In addition, juvenile inmates ages sixteen to seventeen in adult prisons did not have significant higher rates of sexual victimization in comparison to adult inmates. An estimated 1.8% of juvenile inmates ages sixteen to seventeen reported being victimized by another inmate, in comparison to 2.0% of adult prisoners and 1.6% of adults in jails. Among juvenile inmates in the same age range, 3.2% juveniles reported experiencing staff sexual misconduct, in comparison to 2.4% of adults in prisons and 1.8% of adults in jails. Furthermore, inmates that reported their sexual orientation as gay, lesbian, bisexual, or other has the highest rates of sexual assault within the period of this survey (2011‚Äì12). Out of inmates who identify as non-heterosexual, 12.2% of prison inmates and 8.5% of jail inmates reported being sexually victimized by another inmate; 5.4% of prison inmates and 4.3% jail inmates reported being sexually victimized by facility staff. During 2016 and 2017, the U.S Department of Justice and the Bureau of Justice statistics updated the data collected for the Prison Rape Elimination Act (2003) through the National Survey of Youth in Custody (NSYC). The National Survey of Youth in Custody provided an estimate of youth reporting sexual victimization in juvenile facilities through computerized self-interviewing technology. This survey was first conducted in June 2008 and the third data was collected in 2017. The collected data highlighted that sexual assault in female-only juvenile facilities (5.3%) was more than three times greater than in male-only facilities (1.5%). Youth-on-youth sexual assault was lowest (1.1%) in facilities where almost all youth reported to have first learned sexual assault was not allowed within the first twenty-four hours of arrival. For facilities with a 76% greater concentration of youth with a history of psychiatric conditions, there was a 4.0% reported incidents of sexual assault by another youth. Youth reported a 5.9% of staff sexual misconduct for facilities with multiple living units, in comparison to 2.1% of youth in facilities with single units. To conclude, rates of staff sexual misconduct were highest in facilities where youth perceived the facility staff to be unfair (10.3%), youth had the fewest positive perceptions of staff (9.7%), and youth worried about physical assault by other youth (8.2%) or staff (11.2%).  Psychological repercussion  According to the report conducted by the Bureau of Justice Statistics in 2011‚Äì12, inmates with serious psychological distress reported high rates of inmate-on-inmate and staff sexual assault. An estimated 6.3% of federal prison inmates with serious psychological distress reported to have been sexually victimized by another inmate, in comparison to 0.7% of inmates with no serious mental illnesses. Similar statistics were reported for non-heterosexual inmates who reported higher rates of inmate-on- inmate sexual victimization; 21% of prison inmates and 14.7% of jail inmates with serious psychological distress reported being sexually assaulted. For each measured subgroups (sex, race or Hispanic origin, body mass index, sexual orientation, and offense), inmates with serious psychological distress reported higher rates of inmate-on-inmate sexual victimization than inmates without mental health problems. This statistical information is very important due to the very complex repercussions that sexual assault and rape can cause to an individual. According to the data provided by the Bureau of Justice and Statistics, 36.6% of prison inmates and 43.7% of jail inmates reported being told by a mental health professional that they had a mental disorder. Inmates identified with serious psychological distress reported high overall rates of sexual victimization. Serious psychological distress was identified on inmates through the use of the K6 screening test. The test consisted of six questions on how often had the inmates felt nervous, hopeless, restless, depressed, effortless, and worthless in the past 30 days. A summary score was added to three categories: 0‚Äì7 meaning no mental illness, 8‚Äì12 meaning anxiety-mood disorder, and 13 or higher meant serious psychological distress. State and federal inmates identified with serious psychological distress that were sexually victimized by another inmate were an estimated 6.3% and sexually victimized by a facility staff member were 5.6%. Likewise, 3.6% of jail inmates identified with serious psychological distress reported being sexually victimized by another inmate and 3.6% being sexually victimized by a staff member. The Human Rights Watch published a book titled \\"No Escape: Male Rape in the U.S\\" on April 17, 2007 where they conducted extensive research for three years to expose the problem of male rape in United States prisons. The information provided in the book was collected from over 200 prisoners among thirty-four states. The Human Rights Watch included a specific description of the psychological effects that rape has on victims of sexual victimization, stating \\"Victims of prison rape commonly report nightmares, deep depression, shame, loss of self-esteem, self-hatred, and considering or attempting suicide. Some of them also describe a marked increase in anger and a tendency towards violence.\\" Consequently, due to the severity of the act one of the most important repercussion is the fear that is instigated far beyond the initial trauma reaction. In Patricia Resick's article titled, \\"The Trauma of Rape and the Criminal Justice System\\", she addresses a therapy study of fear in rape victims and states, \\"it was not uncommon for women who were ten or twenty years postrape to seek help for continuing rape-related problems.\\"  Sexually transmitted infections  A prevalent issue that occurs because of prison rape is the transmission of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, in December 2008, a total of 21,987 inmates in both federal and state prisons were HIV positive or were confirmed to have AIDS. Prisons and jails currently hold significantly high rates of HIV compared to the general population at large. There is evidence that rape and other forms of sexual violence assist in transmitting STDs. Violent forms of unprotected vaginal or anal intercourse have the highest risk of transmitting an STD. Especially for the receptive partner, outcomes of coerced sex tear the membrane of the anus or vagina and cause profuse bleeding. The unfortunate reality is that \\"prison rape incidents often involve multiple perpetrators\\" which aids in the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and, \\"unlike sexual assault in the general community, a person who is raped in prison may be unable to remove him- or herself from the vicinity of the perpetrator or perpetrators and thus may be raped repeatedly while incarcerated\\". Despite the increasing number of prisoners with sexually transmitted diseases, reliable statistics on prisoners who have received STDs due to prison rape are unavailable. Many reports of sexual abuse of either coerced vaginal or anal intercourse remain unreported. It is important to note, \\"racial and ethnic discrimination, low socioeconomic status, migrant status, mental illness, and housing instability can also, independently or with each other, increase the risk of detention and HIV infection\\". Transgender people notoriously, \\"face high risks of HIV transmission and incarceration as a result of criminalization, discrimination in health settings, punitive law enforcement, and social marginalization\\". Women that are transgender, \\"are [specifically] subject to high levels of police abuse, including profiling as sex workers and sexual exploitation and physical and verbal abuse from guards and male inmates while in detention\\". Mass overcrowding has become a serious issue within federal and state prisons, which greatly contributes to the prevalence of sexual abuse. The prison population has dramatically increased in the 2000s due to policies such as increasing sentencing laws and the War on Drugs. Prisoners thus become more vulnerable to HIV infections and other sexually transmitted diseases because of the lack of space and resources available to them. With a larger prison population to watch over, there is less supervision and protection offered to prisoners and many become subject to abuse, including prison rape. Overcrowding of prisons affects not only prison populations, but acts as a serious public health issue and can adversely affect society's health as a whole. Released individuals can easily transfer an STD to others within the larger society. Therefore, it is crucial to prevent the transmission of infectious diseases within prisons. There are rarely any resources available for the prevention of STD transmission. Some systems, like city and county jail systems, do not actively seek to identify and treat inmates with STDs. Despite being highly recommended by public health officials, preventative materials against the transmission of STDs, including condom distribution, HIV testing, and counseling and risk assessment, are rarely accessible to prisoners.  Prison rape and sexuality  In prison rape, the perpetrator and victim are almost always the same sex (due to the gender-segregated nature of prison confinement). As such, a host of issues regarding sexual orientation and gender roles are associated with the topic. Along with the bribe for protection, both male and female inmates sell sex for money, or additional reasons such as bribery or blackmail. According to the 2006 Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) study, in 30 percent of the inmate-on-inmate incidents, victims were talked into the sexual encounter. This finding shows that there is more behind the prison rape than simply one's sexuality. Male sexual victimization was more frequently perpetrated by the staff, whereas the perpetrator for female inmates was more frequently another inmate. This discrepancy in sexual assault between genders could be linked lack of reporting by the inmates. A recent study found that \\"only approximately one quarter of the male inmates and one tenth of the female inmates reported their perceived victimization to a correctional officer or a prison official.\\" The reports of victimization among women and men involved abusive sexual contact and some form of forced sex. In U.S. women prisons, there is the common notion that sexual encounters usually occur more in hopes of \\"love, affection, and companionship.\\" This is somewhat true, but there is also a hypersexualization and stereotype associated with incarcerated women. Some of the society sees incarcerated women as socially deviant and overly sexual, which can translate over to the notion that the women in the prisons always have voluntary relationships. A study in 1966 noted that 21 percent of the females inmates had a voluntary homosexual relationship. However, the most recent research on women inmates indicates a change. The latest study found that only \\"five of the 35 women\\" interviewed were in a voluntary homosexual relationship, with most of the women now describing themselves as \\"loners.\\" This change indicates that homosexual relationships among incarcerated women do not occur as frequently as in prior generations. LGBT inmates are more likely to be raped while incarcerated. Although the sexual assault reporting system is notoriously flawed because of inmate fear or pride, elaboration on this statement is found in a recent publication. All of the inmate surveys conducted by the Bureau of Justice Statistics confirms that LGBT inmates \\"report higher rates of sexual victimization than their straight counterparts.\\" In the 2011 to 2012 Survey, the Bureau found that within the past twelve months 12.2% of non-heterosexual people in prison reported inmate- on-inmate sexual assaults and heterosexual inmates reported 1.2%. In regards to staff-on-inmate sexual assault, 5.4% of nonheterosexual inmates reported victimization, compared to 2.1% of heterosexual inmates who reported victimization. A study conducted in a California prison discovered that 67 percent of LGBTQ inmates reported sexual assault during their incarceration. Many speculate that these numbers are due to their place in the sexual hierarchy in prison, which automatically makes them targets of sexual assault. These findings illustrate that the incarcerated LGBT population faces significantly higher rates of victimization than their heterosexual counterparts. Some prisons separate known homosexuals, bisexuals, and transgender people from the general prison population to prevent rape and violence against them. There are, however, other methods to get oneself segregated from population, such as rule infractions or feigned suicide attempts. Other inmates have resorted to killing their rapist (or probable future rapist), particularly those who already have long sentences and are thus immune from further legal consequences. Shame regarding perceived homosexuality may contribute to the under-reporting of prison rape by victims. Prison rape statistics are much higher than reported, as many victims are afraid to report, being threatened with physical violence by rapists if reported, as well as staff indifference. Public Law 108-79 was passed in the United States in 2003. According to Stop Prisoner Rape, Inc.: Reporting prison rape \\"Sexual assault is [already] an underreported crime,\\" and prison rape only increases the likelihood for individuals to not \\"report their assaults to law enforcement personnel.\\" A \\"Crime Victimization Survey [concluded] that only 20‚Äì35% of female sexual assault victims\\" openly discuss and report their assault to police enforcement. Sexual assault victims deal with severe shame and fear, which plays a significant role in their decision to report the crime. Women and minorities have especially difficult circumstances when it comes to dealing with reporting sexual assault to law enforcement. \\"Certain communities and settings\\" make it more difficult to report assault; for instance college campuses are notorious for not handling rape claims appropriately. The Prison Rape Elimination Act \\"(PREA) was passed in 2003, but\\" unfortunately the guidelines and standards that made up the act were not executed nationally until 2014. A study conducted by five reputable scholars analyzed \\"what factors\\" are important to the decision making process of women behind reporting sexual assault in prison \\"in an effort to inform or enhance the implementation of PREA.\\" The study was made up of 179 incarcerated women who experienced \\"almost 400 incidents of staff sexual misconduct.\\" The study was focused on women because there is a higher volume of women sexually assaulted in prisons, making the majority of the reporting cases studied female. The study addressed the individual-level factors that contribute to the reporting of sexual assault in prisons. Victim gender plays a role in reporting, in \\"that female victims of sexual assault are more likely to report their assaults than male victims.\\" In regards to victim race, it appeared that there was no difference in reported cases based on race in incarcerated women. Another important factor in reported cases of sexual assault can be victim age. Younger victims are more likely to report than older victims, most likely because younger victims want to take action while the older victims are more concerned with the \\"potential consequences with reporting.\\" Victim's income and victim education are surprising factors in that \\"women of higher socioeconomic status are less likely to report sexual assault,\\" and women with higher education tend to report less frequently than those with less formal schooling. In addition to these individual-level factors, the study revealed that the type of assault had adverse effects of the likelihood of reporting. \\"Assaults which resulted in a physical injury were 3.7 times more likely to be reported\\" and the \\"assaults that occurred on more than one occasion were only half as likely to be reported.\\" Assaults that resulted in compensation in one form or another were much less likely to be reported. All of these factors that determine an inmate's likelihood of reporting play a major role in how prison rape should be handled. Individuals need to feel comfortable with speaking out and need to be aware of their options in regards to reporting, as well as a reassessment of correctional staff. In another study, Brett Garland and Gabrielle Wilson studied whether reporting sexual assault is viewed the same as snitching in prison settings. The data gathered from their scholarly journal was collected from the \\"EthnoMethodological Study of the Subculture of Prison Inmate Sexuality in the United States, 2004‚Äì2005, retrieved from the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research\\", which analyzed 409 male inmates and 155 female inmates from \\"30 high-security prisons\\". These prisons were spread throughout 10 different states within \\"four regions of the United States\\". The results of Garland and Wilson's analysis of the data were \\"sixty-five percent of the inmates studied\\" agreed that reporting sexual assault is the same as snitching. It was also found that \\"the odds of an inmate considering that reporting rape is synonymous with snitching increases 33% for every\\" increase in the months that have been served on an individual's sentencing time. But, as time goes on, an inmate's likelihood of registering reporting with snitching will eventually hit a plateau, and their sentencing time will no longer determine their view on reporting. Race and ethnicity were evaluated and the data showed that \\"black inmates are less likely to consider reporting rape as snitching.\\" Several other variables were analyzed, such as \\"age first imprisoned, prior prison commitments, age, marital status, sexual orientation, or violent offense,\\" but proved to be not significant with the goal of the research. This study shines a light on the reality of inmates' views on rape. Garland and Wilson conclude that there is \\"a need to address inmate socialization immediately upon inmate arrival, as the likelihood of accepting the reporting of rape as snitching increases the most during the earlier months of incarceration.\\" The study reassures that an inmate's decision on whether or not to report sexual assault depends again on a multitude of factors. A journal written by four scholarly researchers, the subject of rape myth acceptance (RMA) was analyzed to see how it affects the reporting of sexual assault with women. Throughout the beginning of their study, the authors introduced the idea of the \\"'classic rape'\\" which is seen as an \\"abduction, the perpetrator being a stranger, severe force, and serious injury.\\" Incarcerated women are likely to compare their own sexual assault to their own concept of what constitutes as \\"rape.\\" This correlation is believed to \\"negatively impact women's decisions to report to the police.\\" Rape myth is defined as \\"specific beliefs about rape that are widespread and persistently held, despite the fact that they are largely false.\\" The overall goal of the study was to determine \\"whether RMA is a true barrier for incarcerated women\\" in terms of reporting behaviors. The results of the study showed that women who accepted rape myths were \\"98.1 times less likely\\" to report their sexual assault to the police. It is highlighted that \\"rape victims' mental health\\" is directly affected by whether or not they decided to report their sexual assault. It is disclosed that individuals that report their assault early on \\"can result in higher self-esteem and fewer post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms.\\" Since RMA is negatively correlated with a victim's reporting behavior, it can be said, \\"RMA is a barrier to psychological recovery and healing.\\"  Politics  The US has been proven to imprison, \\"a larger percentage of its population than any other country in the world except the Seychelles whose population is 0.03% of the United States'. Inmates in America are, \\"at least three times more likely to have HIV/AIDS than the general US population\\". The authors of a study published in 2014 in Health Affairs, \\"surveyed the medical directors of the 50 state prison systems and 40 of the largest jails in the country\\" and \\"found that only 19% of the prison systems and 35% of the jails provided opt-out HIV testing\\". Those are tests in which all, \\"inmates are tested unless they specifically decline\\". Timothy Flanigan, a Brown University infectious disease specialist, pointed out that \\"other countries have a much more proactive approach\\" than the US. He added that, \\"unfortunately, our jail and prison systems are governed largely by cities and states\\": they're not federal. The privatization of correctional facilities can be harmful to the public health, the incentive to screen and treat inmates at a cost is low. Condoms are, \\"an inexpensive way to minimize the risk of HIV transmission in jails and prisons, but few state prison systems and only some of the largest jails provide them\\". People largely, deeply misunderstand the gravity of prison rape. There are many issues caused by rape in prison, including the fact that it, \\"undermines the authority structure in prison settings\\". Some victims, \\"find that sexual predators control their lives more so than...the institutional authority\\". The disturbingly high prevalence of rape in correctional facilities, \\"produces a perception in the general public that prisons are chaotic, not secure; jails and prisons should be places where crimes are paid for, not committed\\". It is also important to acknowledge that, \\"a rampant prison rape culture increases levels of violence in and out of prisons\\". Prison rape has, \\"long been recognized as a contributing factor in fights, homicides, insurrections, and other forms of institutional violence\\". Prison rape also creates a public health problem. Following traumatic events, \\"victims require physical and mental health treatment both while in prison and after they have been released\\". It also, \\"furthers the spread of communicable diseases, such as HIV, AIDS, tuberculosis, and hepatitis B and C, both in and out of prison\\". The, \\"physical and psychological problems resulting from prison rape also make it difficult for former inmates to keep steady jobs or to assimilate back into the normal routines of life\\". One expert voiced that, \\"a high prevalence of prison rape results in \\"higher recidivism, more homeless [,] or at best individuals requiring some form of government assistance.\\"\\" American society, \\"fails to see prison rape for the tragedy that it is, a tragedy affecting not only prisons and prisoners, but also society at large\\". Michael Horowitz, senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, is credited by many \\"as being the creative force behind the prison rape legislation\\": PREA. He, \\"was influential in initiating the idea, developing the legislative language, and coordinating a groundswell of support for the bill from a diverse coalition of public interest, religious, and policy groups\\". The \\"diverse coalition included Amnesty International, Concerned Women of America, Focus on the Family, Human Rights Watch, Justice Policy Institute, NAACP, National Association of Evangelicals, Open Society Policy Center, National Council of La Raza, Prison Fellowship, Stop Prisoner Rape, and many other organizations\\". The legislation was created in attempt, \\"to change the attitudes and perceptions of government officials and people in the corrections field toward prison rape by making the prevention, investigation, and prosecution of prison rape a top priority throughout the nation's correctional facilities\\". While providing the foundation, \\"for the gathering of solid data on the extent of the prison rape problem\\" and helping, \\"corrections officials to make informed decisions as they attempt to eliminate it\\". Many human rights groups, such as the Human Rights Watch and Stop Prisoner Rape, have cited documented incidents showing that prison staff tolerate rape as a means of controlling the prison population in general. The topic of prison rape is common in American humor. Jokes such as \\"don't drop the soap\\" seem to suggest that prison rape is an expected consequence of being sent to prison. This phenomenon is exemplified by the 2006 U.S. feature film Let's Go to Prison or the board game Don't Drop the Soap being marketed by John Sebelius, the son of Kathleen Sebelius. Songs have also been composed about the topic, e.g. the song \\"Prisoner of Love\\" by radio personalities Bob and Tom, performing as \\"Slam and Dave\\". U.S. Federal law, under the Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003, calls for the compilation of national prison rape statistics, annual hearings by a review panel, and the provision of grants to the states to address prison rape. A first, highly- controversial and disputed study, funded under the PREA by Mark Fleisher, concludes prison rape is rare: \\"Prison rape worldview doesn't interpret sexual pressure as coercion,\\" he wrote. \\"Rather, sexual pressure ushers, guides or shepherds the process of sexual awakening.\\" In 2007, the US Supreme Court refused to hear the case of Khalid el-Masri, who had accused the CIA of torture, including 'forced anal penetration', due to state secrets privilege.ACLU petition, 2006. (PDF). Retrieved on May 28, 2012.Burke Hansen. Supreme Court denies cert in el-Masri rendition case. The Register (October 9, 2007) In 2012, the US Justice department issued nationally enforceable protocols to all correctional institutions to expand upon the provisions of the 2003 PREA ACT. The move is an effort to prevent, detect and respond to prison rape more effectively. The measure includes numerous provisions, such as barring juveniles from being housed with adult inmates, a ban on cross- gender pat-down searches, video monitoring and special attention to lesbian, gay, transgender or bisexual inmates vulnerable to abuse. Attorney General Eric Holder noted that \\"these standards are the result of a thoughtful and deliberative process ‚Äì and represent a critical step forward in protecting the rights and safety of all Americans.\\"  Prison Rape Elimination Act  The Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) was an act passed in 2003, and administered to ensure protection for the inmates in the epidemic of prison rape. Many actors were included in this process of making up the act. The goal of the act was to \\"provide for the analysis of the incidence and effects of prison rape in Federal, State, and local institutions and to provide information, resources, recommendation and funding to protect individuals from prison rape.\\" Some of the highlights from the prison elimination act was \\"requires development of standards for detection, prevention, reduction, and punishment of prison rape. Standardized collection and dissemination of information on the incidence of prison rape. Awards grants to help State and local governments implement the Act's provision. The act applies to all public and private institutions that house adult or juvenile offenders and to community- based correctional agencies.\\" Although all these rules were put in place to combat prison rape, it ultimately did not decrease sexual assault in prison. The act did not take into consideration the overcrowding in prisons or if instruction was enforced on correctional officers to enforce these rules. Another problem that appeared is that act was a national act, which allowed states to make the decision, to follow or not to follow the act. The delegation of funds to treat inmates was tricky due to having a lack of funds to achieve the goals they planned or promised.

However, when Ahmed Mirza went to war against Sultan Mahmud Khan, the Khan of Moghulistan, to reclaim Tashkent from him, Shaybani secretly met the Moghul Khan and agreed to betray and plunder Ahmed's army. This happened in the Battle of the Chirciq River in 1488 CE, resulting in a decisive victory for Moghulistan. Sultan Mahmud Khan gave TurkistanThis probably means Turkestan (city). Needs check and clarification. to Shaybani as a reward. Here, however, Shaybani oppressed the local Kazakhs, resulting in a war between Moghulistan and the Kazakh Khanate. Moghulistan was defeated in this war, but Shaybani gained power among the Uzbeks. He decided to conquer Samarkand and Bukhara from Ahmed Mirza. Sultan Mahmud's subordinate emirs convinced him to aid Shaybani in doing so, and together they marched on Samarkand.Mirza Muhammad Haidar Dughlat. Tarikh-i-Rashidi, 1546.  Foundation of Shaybanid Dynasty  Continuing the policies of his grandfather, Abul-Khayr Khan, Shaybani ousted the Timurids from their capital Samarkand by 1500. He fought successful campaigns against the Timurid leader Babur, founder of the Mughal Empire. In 1505 he recaptured Samarkand and in 1507 also took Herat, the southern capital of the Timurids. Shaybani conquered Bukhara in 1506 and established the Shaybanid Dynasty of the Khanate of Bukhara. In 1508‚Äì09, he carried out many raids northward, pillaging the land of the Kazakh Khanate. However he suffered a major defeat from Kazakhs under Kasim Khan in 1510.  Foreign policy  Shaybani Khan maintained ties with Ottoman Empire and China.

In 1510, Shaybani Khan was in Herat. At this time, Ismail I, having learned about the failures of Shaybani Khan in the battle against the Hazaras, invaded Western Khorasan and began to rapidly advance towards Herat. Shaybani Khan did not have a strong army at his disposal. During the military campaign against the Hazaras, he lost most of his cavalry.Materials on the History of Turkmens and Turkmenia. –¢. 2; –ú.; L., 1938. p.44 The main army was stationed in Mawarannahr, so he, having consulted with his emirs, hastened to hide behind the walls of Merv. Safavid troops captured Astrabad, Mashhad, and also Sarakhs. All Shaybani's emirs who were in Khorasan, including Jan Wafa, fled from the Safavid-Qizilbash army and arrived to Merv. Shaybani Khan sent a messenger to Ubaydulla Khan and Muhammad Timur Sultan for help. Meanwhile, Shah Ismail surrounded Merv and besieged the city for a whole month, but to no avail. Therefore, in order to lure the Khan out of the city, he resorted to a feigned retreat.History of the Safavids that decorates the World (in Russian) According to some sources, one of the wives of Muhammad Shaybani Khan, Aisha Sultan Khanum, better known as Moghul Khanum, enjoyed great influence on her husband and his court. The sources say that at the Kengesh (council of the Khan), question arouse whether or not to come out of Merv and fight the retreating troops of Shah Ismail. The emirs of Shaybani Khan suggested waiting two or three days until the auxiliary forces arrive from Mawarannahr. But the beloved wife of Muhammad Shaybani, Mogul Khanum, who took part in the military council, said to the Khan: ‚ÄúAnd you are afraid of the Qizilbash! If you are afraid, I will take the troops myself and lead them. Now is the right moment, there will be no such moment again.\\" After these words of Mogul Khanum, everyone seemed to be ashamed, and the Khan's troops went into battle, which resulted in their complete defeat and the death of Shaybani Khan.Turkmenistan and Turkmens in the late 15th-first half of the 16th century, according to \\"Alam Ara-i Safavi\\".

After capturing Samarkand from Babur, Shaybani married Babur's sister, Khanzada Begum. Babur's liberty to leave Samarkand was made contingent upon his assent to this alliance. After Shaybani's death, Ismail I gave liberty to Khanzada Begum with her son and, at Babur's request, sent them to his court. For this reason Shaybani was succeeded not by a son but by an uncle, a cousin and a brother whose descendants would rule Bukhara until 1598 and Khwarizm (later named Khiva) until 1687. From the accounts of Babur, i.e. the Baburnama, we came to know that the Shah of Persia Ismail beheaded Shaybani and had his skull turned into a bejeweled drinking goblet which was drunk from when entertaining; he later sent the cup to Babur as a goodwill gesture. The rest of Shaybani's body parts were either sent to various areas of the empire for display or put on a spike at the main gate of Samarkand.

The story concerns a fox that tries to eat grapes from a vine but cannot reach them. Rather than admit defeat, he states they are undesirable. The expression \\"sour grapes\\" originated from this fable. The fable The fable of The Fox and the Grapes is one of the few which feature only a single animal protagonist. There are several Greek versions as well as one in Latin by Phaedrus (IV.3) which is terse and to the point: In her version of La Fontaine's Fables, Marianne Moore underlines his ironic comment on the situation in a final pun, \\"Better, I think, than an embittered whine\\".The text appears on p.4 of the document at cfaitc.org Although the fable describes purely subjective behaviour, the English idiom \\"sour grapes\\", which derives from the story, is now often used also of envious disparagement to others. Similar expressions exist in other languages of Europe and Asia,p. 17, 18. Peter Unseth, Daniel Kliemt, Laurel Morgan, Stephen Nelson, Elaine Marie Scherrer. Wellerism proverbs: Mapping their distribution. [GIALens 2017 Volume 11, No. 3. Web link].The Concise Dictionary or European Proverbs, London 1998, p.989, proverb 986 but in the Scandinavian equivalent the fox makes its comment about rowanberries since grapes are not common in northern latitudes.See the Wiktionary definition of the Swedish proverb and the YouTube animation of its Finnish equivalent: La Fontaine's Le Renard et les Raisins Pierre Julien's sculpture of La Fontaine with attendant fox The French fable of La Fontaine (III.11) is almost as concise and pointed as the early versions of Babrius and Phaedrus and certainly contributed to the story's popularity. A century after its publication, this was the tale with which the sculptor Pierre Julien chose to associate its creator in his statue of La Fontaine (commissioned in 1782), now in the Louvre. The poet is represented in a famous episode of his life, when he was seen one morning by the Duchess of Bouillon seated against a tree trunk meditating. When she passed the same spot that evening he was still there in exactly the same position. Julien has portrayed him in an ample cloak, with a gnarled tree on which a vine with grapes is climbing. On his knee is the manuscript of the poem; at his feet, a fox is seated on his hat with its paw on a leather-bound volume, looking up at him. Gustave Dor√©'s illustration of the fable for the 1870 edition pictures a young man in a garden who is looking towards the steps to a mansion in the distance on which several young women are congregated. An older man is holding up his thumb and forefinger, indicating that they are only little girls. The meaning of this transposition to the human situation hinges on the double meaning of 'unripe' (vert) in French, which could also be used of a sexually immature female. From this emerges the story's subtext, of which a literal translation reads: There is the same sexual ambiguity in the Greek of Babrius. The phrase there is \\"\\" (), the word having both the literal meaning of an unripe grape and the metaphorical usage of a girl not yet ripe for marriage. Cognitive dissonance Rather than admit his failure to reach the grapes, the fox rationalises that they are not really desirable. One commentator argues that the story illustrates the state of cognitive dissonance. The fox is taken as attempting to hold incompatible ideas simultaneously, desire and its frustration. In that case, the disdain expressed by the fox at the conclusion to the fable serves at least to reduce the dissonance through criticism. Jon Elster calls this pattern of mental behaviour \\"adaptive preference formation\\".Elster, Jon. Sour Grapes: Studies in the Subversion of Rationality. Cambridge 1983, p. 123ff. Concise translations Many translations, whether of Aesop's fable or of La Fontaine's, are wordy and often add details not sanctioned by the original. Two English authors have produced short poetical versions which still retain both the general lines of the story and its lesson. The first of these is a quatrain by Aphra Behn appearing in Francis Barlow's illustrated edition of the fables (1687): The second also accompanies an illustrated edition, in this case the work of Walter Crane in Baby's Own Aesop (1887). Each fable has been reduced to a limerick by W.J.Linton and is enclosed within the design. \\"The Fox and the Grapes\\" has been given the moral 'The grapes of disappointment are always sour' and runs as follows: By comparison, the Phaedrus version has six pentameter lines, of which two draw the moral, and Gabriele Faerno's Latin reworking has five lines and two more drawing the moral.Fabulae Centum Fable XIX, p.47 Both Babrius and La Fontaine have eight, the latter using his final line to comment on the situation. Though the emblematist Geoffrey Whitney confines the story to four lines, he adds two more of personal application: 'So thou, that hunt'st for that thou longe hast mist,/ Still makes thy boast, thou maist if that thou list.'Choice of Emblemes (1586), p.98 The fable was also one that the French poet Isaac de Benserade summed up in a single quatrain, not needing to go into much detail since his verses accompanied the hydraulic statue of it in the labyrinth of Versailles. He can therefore afford a thoughtful, moralising tone: But Benserade then adds another quatrain, speculating on the fox's mental processes; finally it admits that the grapes really were ripe but 'what cannot be had, you speak of badly'.The French text is online, Fables (1678), p.15 Artistic uses One of La Fontaine's early illustrators was the artist Jean- Baptiste Oudry, who was also artistic director at both the Beauvais and the Gobelins tapestry works. In consequence of this a series based on La Fontaine's fables designed by Oudry was produced by them during the 1740s and included \\"The Fox and the Grapes\\". These stayed in production for some forty years and were imitated by other factories in France and abroad,Hunter, George Leland: Tapestries, their origin, history and renaissance, London, 1912, p.193-4; available online at archive.org being used not just as wall hangings but for chair covers and other domestic purposes. Furniture craftsmen in France also used the fables as themes and took these with them when they emigrated. Among them was Martin Jugiez (d.1815), who had a workshop in the American city of Philadelphia where the still surviving Fox and Grapes chest of drawers was produced. A wooden panel from an 18th-century chest of drawers The S√®vres porcelain works used the fables on their china as well as reproducing Pierre Julien's statue from a preliminary model in 1784, even before the finished product was exhibited.John-whitehead.co.uk Another domestic use for the fable was as an architectural medallion on the outside of mansions, of which there is still an example dating from the turn of the 19th century on the Avenue Felix Faur√© in Paris. A medallion of another kind, cast in bronze by Jean Vernon (1897‚Äì1975), was produced as part of his renowned series based on the fables in the 1930s. That of \\"The Fox and the Grapes\\" features two foxes scrambling up a trellis with what looks like more success than La Fontaine's creation. There was as diverse a use of the fables in England and from as early a date. Principally this was on domestic china and includes a Chelsea candlestick (1750) and a Worcester jug (1754) in the 18th century; a Brownhills alphabet plate (1888) in the 19th century; and a collector's edition from the Knowles pottery (1988) in the 20th. Series based on Aesop's fables became popular for pictorial tiles towards the end the 19th century, of which Minton Hollins produced a particularly charming example illustrating \\"The Fox and the Grapes\\". On this a vixen is accompanied by her cubs, who make ineffectual leaps at the grapes while the mother contemplates them with her paws clasped behind her.

In a political career spanning over 40 years, he held office as President of the Board of Agriculture, President of the Local Government Board, Chief Secretary for Ireland, Secretary of State for the Colonies and First Lord of the Admiralty. He is also remembered for his links with Irish Unionism, and served as Leader of the Irish Unionist Party in the House of Commons from 1906 to 1910. Background and education Long was born at Bath, the eldest son of Richard Penruddocke Long, by his wife Charlotte Anna, daughter of William Wentworth FitzWilliam Dick (originally Hume). The 1st Baron Gisborough was his younger brother. On his father's side he was descended from an old family of Wiltshire gentry, and on his mother's side from Anglo-Irish gentry in County Wicklow. When young, Walter lived at Dolforgan Hall, Montgomeryshire, a property owned by his grandfather. Whilst living there, his father inherited the Rood Ashton Estate. Long went to Hilperton school, Amesbury, where he was harshly disciplined by Edwin Meyrick. At Harrow, Walter was popular, proving a sporty captain of cricket. It was during Walter's studies at Christ Church, Oxford, that his father had a mental breakdown, and two years later died in February 1875. Upon his father's death, he took over management of the family properties, whilst his mother moved into a house in Oxford. It was a stressful time, during which he was frequently summoned by his mother, and his younger brother also accumulated gathering debts. Long continued to box, ride and hunt, as well as play college cricket. Afternoons spent with the Bicester, Heythrops, and South Oxfordshire hunts were matched by the university Drag Hunt. His proficiency was reflected in the early offer to become Master of the Vale of White Horse Hunt, which he turned down. His agent H Medlicott despaired at the danger to the family fortune, urging him to cut his relations loose; but he raised a new ¬£30,000 mortgage on lands, which Medlicott complained he would have to sell. On coming down from Oxford in 1877, he purchased a Coach and Four for ¬£200. After a year in Wiltshire, he married Lady Boyle. Long served as an officer in the Royal Wiltshire Yeomanry, being promoted Major in 1890 and becoming Lieutenant- Colonel in command from 1898 to 1906. Political career, 1880‚Äì1911 Long was determined on a career in politics, campaigning at Marlborough in a traditional Liberal seat in 1879. After Sir George Jenkinson agreed to resign in North Wiltshire, he was adopted by 'half a dozen country gentlemen'.Sir C. Petrie, \\"Walter Long and His Times\\" (London 1936), pp. 31‚Äì2. John Kendle, \\"Walter Long and Unionism\\", p. 9. At the 1880 general election, Long was elected to parliament as a Conservative for North Wiltshire, a seat he held until 1885. A supporter of Lord Beaconsfield, the British Empire, Church of England and state, he was against extending education, but favoured bible teachings in schools. He won the two-member North Wiltshire seat by more than 2000 votes. At the time Beaconsfield died on 19 April 1881, he was making a record of his days in the Commons: > I rose somewhere about 8.30 and as a new member was duly called. The Liberal government was in trouble over Egypt and the Bradlaugh incident; and the Conservatives were internally divided. He hunted for the Beaufort Hounds. > I selected as my time, midnight until, if necessary, eight in the morning. I > used to leave London at 5.30 in the morning, providing the House was up, > take the train down to Chippenham, have my hunt, and get back to London by > train leaving Chippenham about 7.30... I was at the House at midnight and I > would stay there till it rose.Walter Long, \\"Memories\\" (London 1923), pp. > 80‚Äì83. He made his first speech on 26 July 1880 during the third reading of the Compensation for Disturbances (Ireland) bill. Devizes constituency]. Caricature by Spy published in Vanity Fair in 1886. Long won his seat with a reduced majority of 95 votes at the November 1885 general election. There was considerable anger at the Conservatives 'Fair Trade policy' for workers. He believed English people had little understanding of Ireland or the minority in Ireland that Home Rule would not protect, and that Gladstone's Home Rule policy would lead to the dismemberment of the empire. The home rule policy was defeated, Long was returned with an increased majority of 1726 votes in July 1886. Aged thirty-two, Long was asked to become a junior minister to C. T. Ritchie at the Local Government Board, in Salisbury's government. They had noticed his unswerving support from the backbenches. He was approachable and had a no-nonsense manner, an excellent memory: logical and crisp. He was both mature and responsible for a young MP. The very strong connections he had with the agricultural community assisted local government in his area. He entered government for the first time in 1886 in Lord Salisbury's second administration as Parliamentary Secretary to the Local Government Board, serving under Charles Ritchie, and became one of the architects of the Local Government Act 1888, which established elected county councils. Long dealt with Poor Law reform in the county areas, slum reforms, reform of the London County Council, and better housing for the working-classes. He was deputed to make speeches backing the government position on the LCC bill, although he was not responsible for its draft or passage. Ritchie was to deal with the towns in Local Government Act 1888, but was ill for the period, and Long had \\"a sound grasp its details and essentials.\\"Kendle, p. 15. On 6 Feb 1887, he made an important speech in the \\"Plan of Campaign\\" from which unionism there seemed to encourage landlordism. However behind the law for tenant compensation, Long knew lay a deeper demand for independence. He continued to be worried by the Liberals' policy of Home Rule, supporting the Irish Unionists who opposed it.The Times, 4 and 6 June 1892. He could not square the retention of Irish MPs at Westminster under the scheme for the second home rule bill. Irish MPs could control English, Scottish, and Welsh affairs, so he argued. The issue was central to the general election of 1892. Long had returned from Canada on a tour speaking on the federal system there. He reiterated the claim that Ulster Unionists would never accept the bill. But Liberals argued that the Conservatives would raise bread prices, and lower wages if returned, \\"the labourers are ignorant lot and swallowed it whole\\", he decried.Ramsden, p. 174. Long was defeated by 138 votes, losing his seat. In July 1892, Liverpool West Derby became vacant and Long defeated the Liberal candidate by 1357 votes at the by-election of 1893. Knowing his grasp of parliamentary procedure, Arthur James Balfour hired him to be a strategist in opposition. The Liberals appointed Long to the Royal Commission on Agriculture, meeting at Trowbridge on 18 January 1893. Long continued in connections with Ireland throughout his career. He did not wish to sever legislative ties of Union with Ireland; but only to offer \\"an extension of the privileges of local government to the Irish people\\".Kendle, p. 18. Home Rule was thrown out by the Lords on 8 September 1893, by 419 votes to 41. In June 1895, the Liberals were resoundingly defeated in the Lords, and the following month Salisbury was returned for another ministry. After the Conservative defeat in 1892, Ritchie's retirement made Long the chief opposition spokesman on local government, and when the Tories returned to power in 1895, he entered the cabinet as President of the Board of Agriculture. In this role he was notable for his efforts to prevent the spread of rabies. The creation of the Board of Agriculture had brought a boost to Long's career in 1889. But opposition rose up strongly, when the Dog Muzzlers act, prompted the Laymen's League in Liverpool to contest the Church discipline bill. Long became increasingly unpopular in his constituency accused of being \\"irascible and scheming\\", and was advised to change seats. But this did not prevent in 1895 admittance to the Privy Council. The bourgeois Navy League in Liverpool could not wait to get rid of him but his powerful friends, like the \\"somnolent\\" Duke of Devonshire gave large donations to the Anti-Socialist Union - and this would be disastrous to the Union, for it would immediately alienate every snob and mediocrity....\\" Yet Long was thick-skinned and seems impervious to the insults, for he remained remarkably successful at the polls.Claude Lowther to R. C. Blumenfeld, 7 September 1909, Bluemenfeld MSS.; Coetzee & Coetzee, 'The Radical Right before 1914', Journal of Contemporary History, vol. 21 (1986), p. 519. For the 'Khaki election' of November 1900, Long won Bristol South. With the ministerial shuffle in 1900, he became President of the Local Government Board. Never an insider, Long worked closely with constituents on local issues showing \\"sensitivity to the wider needs of society\\".Kendle, p. 20. His capacity for hard work revealed that he was also stubborn, short-tempered, with a choleric temperament; a stickler for the letter of the law.Kendle, p. 21. He was frequently plagued by ill-health: neuralgia, arthritis, susceptible to colds and flu; a waspish character, he was not charismatic, nor was he analytic or probing, like his mentor Balfour. In this role, he was criticised as too radical for his support of the Unemployed Workmen's Act 1905, which created an unemployment board to give work and training to the unemployed. In 1903, Long took a leading role as a spokesman for the protectionist wing of the party, advocating tariff reform and imperial preference alongside Joseph Chamberlain and his son Austen Chamberlain, which brought him into conflict with Charles Ritchie, Michael Hicks-Beach and others on the free-trade wing.\\"The Great Fiscal Problem\\", The Evening Post, 11 June 1903. Long was a moderate within the protectionist ranks and became a go-between for the protectionists and free-traders, increasing his prominence and popularity within the party. Perhaps his most significant achievement on the board was the unification of the London water-supply boards into the Metropolitan Water Board. =Chief Secretary for Ireland= Long was offered the position of First Lord of the Admiralty in Lord Selborne's place, as the latter was appointed to the Governor-Generalship of South Africa. But he refused the promotion, advising the appointment of Lord Cawdor. Really what Long wanted was to remain at Local Government, but when George Wyndham resigned as Chief Secretary for Ireland, Balfour was faced with a crisis. Wyndham resigned on 5 March 1905, over what became known as the \\"Wyndham- MacDonnell Imbroglio\\". Sir Antony MacDonnell was a successful Indian civil servant appointed as administrator in Dublin by Wyndham, on the strict understanding that the permanent post made MacDonnell's role a non-political position. MacDonnell was a Catholic from Mayo, whose appointment left unionists wondering if they had been betrayed by London. Nevertheless, having been an experienced and competent implementer of the 1903 Wyndham Land Act, MacDonnell came to be widely seen as a force for moderation. Wyndham was occupied in London with cabinet duties, and so appreciated the implied need for permanent governance. Balfour had already considered Long for the post in January 1905, and to that end consulted both Edward Carson and John Atkinson under pressure from Horace Plunkett and Gerald Balfour, to continue the policy of moderate reform. Due to his Irish connections (both his wife and his mother were Irish), it was hoped that Long might be more acceptable to Irish Unionists than his predecessor. Long was reluctant to accept the offer; frustrated and angered by Lord Dunraven's proposals and MacDonnell's initiatives that he regarded as anti-Unionist. In mid-March he was determined to bring Unionism back from the brink of extinction in Ireland. Arriving in Dublin on 15 March, at dinner there he took the pragmatic view to work with MacDonnell. Throughout March and April he saw no grounds for MacDonnell's dismissal. Yet labouring closely with Unionists to discuss agrarian and non- agrarian crime, and discipline in the RIC, he continued to appease Unionist opinion. He appointed Unionists William Moore as Solicitor-General for Ireland, John Atkinson, as Lord of Appeal, while Edward Saunderson, the Ulsterite member of the Orange Order, became a confidant and close friend. Patronage was usually dispensed by the Lord Lieutenant: this sparked a row with Lord Dudley, and a constitutional argument prompted an appeal to the Prime Minister. Long's motto of \\"patience and firmness\\" was designed to placate Irish Unionists at public meetings, speeches and tours of Ireland, made to reassure local community officials. On 20 April 1905, he made an important speech at Belfast emphasizing that he was a stickler for order and the rule of law. But in the south and west, obdurate landlords refused land sales to tenantry leading to boycotts and cattle-driving. The damage done to unionist farms and farmers was frightening. MacDonnell continually urged compromise, but Long ignored him. The dispute with Lords Dudley and Dunraven dragged on into August 1905, with their attitude of intransigence towards Long's attempts at Unionist reform, and obedience to the law. On 25 May 1905, the issues were discussed in the Commons. He wished to strengthen Unionism; but both Dudley and Long appealed to Balfour for adjudication. Balfour opined that the Chief Secretary was both in the Commons and in the cabinet so Dudley had to be content that the power of the Lords was waning. During the last quarter of 1905, Long advised the postponement of dissolution, as it would hit Unionists hard in \\"the Country\\" and would hand numerous electorates to radicals. He warned of the loss of seats of Bristol West and South. In December 1905, true to his word, he himself was defeated by 2,692 votes. Long continued to distrust 'Birmingham & Co' as he called Chamberlain's struggle for a policy of Tariff recognition, which was already driving the party away from the Free Trade north. Nonetheless he continued to co-operate transnationally with conservative parties in Germany, such as Reichspartei right up until the second Moroccan crisis in 1911.with his colleague in the Anti-Socialist Union, Claude Lowther MP. =Unionist in opposition= Nonetheless Long's parliamentary career was far from finished. He was nominated as Unionist candidate for South County Dublin in 1906 winning by 1,343 votes. Long became one of the leading opposition voices against the Liberals' plans for Home Rule in Ireland. At this stage the Irish Unionist Party's leadership was still in the hands of his friend Edward Saunderson, who was far from energetic, unhelpfully described as \\"devoid of business capacity\\".J. Mackay Wilson to Long, 2 February 1906, LP, BL, Add.MS.62410. The dispute with MacDonnell was carried on in the pages of The Times - Long trying to galvanise Unionist opinion in both England and Ireland. Balfour, Jack Sandars (Balfour's private secretary), and Wyndham all thought he had been duped by Unionism \\"where his vanity and hopes are concerned\\",Sandars to Balfour, 7 October 1906, Balfour Papers, BL, Add. MS.49764, pp. 226‚Äì69. characterising the Chief Secretary as easily manipulated. In October 1906, Saunderson died, and Long was chosen as the new Chairman of Irish Unionist Alliance (IUA) - aimed at closer co-operation between northern and southern parties. Three months later, he was also elected as Chairman of the Ulster Unionist Council (UUC).Alvin Jackson, Home Rule: An Irish History 1800 ‚Äî 2000 (Phoenix, 2004) p. 193. In 1907, he formed the Union Defence League (UDL) as a support in Great Britain for Irish unionism.Kendle 1992, pp. 44‚Äì45. The UDL in London linked with the UUC in Belfast and the IUA in Dublin. It had support from Conservative backbenchers but not the leadership.Green 1995, p. 279. It was active in 1907‚Äì1908 and again after 1911 when the Third Home Rule Bill was imminent;Kendle 1992, pp. 68, 73. with the Primrose League it created the 1914 British Covenant mirroring the 1912 Ulster Covenant.Kendle 1992, pp. 82‚Äì83. Although Long never openly supported the most militant Unionists, who were prepared to fight the Southern nationalists (and perhaps the British Army) to prevent home rule for Ireland, contemporary accounts indicate that he probably had prior knowledge of the Larne gunrunning.Captain F. E. Crawford, a leading figure in the gunrunning, recorded contemporaneously being called to meet Long and Bonar Law before he left to set up the event, and that they \\"wished me God's speed and a successful issue.\\" Crawford's recollections, however, are often inaccurate. Long's Parliamentary Secretary, William Bull, was actively involved in the plot. Jackson, p. 154. In the Commons Walter Long was an active opponent of Liberal social legislation. He founded a Budget Protest League to advance the cause of moderate tax changes. In the Lords the defeat of the 'people's budget' led to the constitutional crisis of 1911. He clashed with Edward Carson adopting a similarly equivocal position over the Parliament Bill of 1911, opposing the Bill, but recommending acquiescence.Alvin Jackson, \\"Long, Walter Hulme, First Viscount Long (1854‚Äì1924)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004. He sat as MP for the Strand between December 1910 and 1918 and St George's between 1918 and 1921. Political career, 1911‚Äì1921 When Balfour resigned as party leader in November 1911, Long, who had never been happy with his leadership style, was pre-eminent in the Conservative Party and one of the leading candidates to succeed him, the candidate of the 'country party'.J. Ramsden, \\"an appetite for Power: A History of the Conservative Party since 1880\\", Harper Collins, 1998, p. 531. As early as 1900, Long had denounced Chamberlain, as the \\"Conservative Party...will not be lead by a bloody radical\\".Ramsden, p. 188. However, he was opposed by Austen Chamberlain, who was backed by the Liberal Unionists still under his father's leadership. Long feared 'the degradation' to the party that a divisive contest might split the protectionist majority of the Unionist coalition, so both candidates agreed to withdraw in favour of Bonar Law, the tertium quid, and a relatively unknown figure, on 12 November.R. Blake, \\"The Conservative Party from Peel to Thatcher\\", Fontana Press, 2nd edition, 1985, p. 194. The unification of the Liberal Unionist and Conservative parties at the Carlton Club in 1912, was for Long acknowledgement of the end of its domination by the country interest.Ramsden, p. 215. Long was always skeptical of coalition, and declared that it would not happen.\\"there has been no coalition - personally I do not favour it, and I doubt its success\\", cited in Ramsden, p. 230. So with the formation of the wartime coalition government in May 1915, Long's awaited return to office at the Local Government Board was greeted by his surprise. Asquith resisted attempts by Unionists to install Long as Chief Secretary.C. Townshend, \\"Easter 1916: The Irish Rebellion\\" (London 2006), p. 296. Long dealt with the plight of thousands of Belgian refugees. He was actively involved in undermining attempts by Lloyd George to negotiate a deal between Irish Nationalists and Unionists in July 1916Townshend, p. 304. over introducing the suspended Home Rule Act 1914, publicly clashing with his arch-rival Sir Edward Carson. He was accused of plotting to bring down Carson by jeopardising an agreement with the nationalist leader John Redmond, that any partition would only be temporary. When Long wanted to alter the clause to permanent, Redmond abandoned further negotiations.Townshend, p. 314. Carson, in a bitter riposte, said of Long \\"The worst of Walter Long is that he never knows what he wants, but is always intriguing to get it\\".Jackson, p. 193. Austen Chamberlain, in 1911, was similarly critical of Long, saying he was \\"at the centre of every coterie of grumblers.\\" Long and the Unionists wanted General Maxwell to have authority over the police, but Asquith finally gave the Chief Secretaryship to a civilian, Henry Duke.Townshend, p. 324. With the fall of Asquith and the accession of the Lloyd George government in December 1916, Long had established himself as the cabinet's foremost authority on Irish policy. Chief Secretary Duke would have preferred to be Inspector-General; but Lloyd George, a natural home ruler, did not seem too happy with Long's brand of federated Unionism. Two allies of the Prime Minister, namely Carson and Lord Edward Cecil, supplied the most intransigent opposition to a united Ireland. It was Long's policy on 16 April 1918 to promote the Conscription bill that would provoke the crisis for Irishness.War Cabinet, 3 April 1918. NA CAB 23/14. Duke opposed a policy of conscription without an offer of home rule, whereas Long wanted the former without the latter.John Kendle, \\"Walter Long, Ireland and the Union 1915-1920\\" (Montreal 1992), p. 164. Townshend, \\"The Republic: The Fight For Irish Independence\\", p. 10. The crisis gave rise to the German Plot, and Long's pressure to act on intelligence against Sinn F√©iners caused him to issue a large number of arrest warrants.Townshend, p. 16. Long was promoted to the Colonial Office, serving until January 1919, when he became First Lord of the Admiralty, a position in which he served until his retirement to the Lords in 1921. From October 1919 on, he was, once again, largely concerned with Irish affairs, serving as the chair of the cabinet's Long Committee on Ireland. In this capacity, he was largely responsible for initiating the Partition of Ireland under the Government of Ireland Act 1920, which followed certain proposals of Lloyd George's failed 1917‚Äì18 Irish Convention, and created separate home rule governments for Southern Ireland and Northern Ireland, the former subsequently evolving as the Irish Free State. In March 1921, Bonar Law resigned as party leader due to ill-health. Sir Austen Chamberlain finally succeeded him in the former office after a ten-year wait. But Long too, getting tired and old, was 'kicked upstairs' with a peerage. He was appointed Lord-Lieutenant of Wiltshire in February 1920,The Times (Monday, 16 February 1920), p. 15. and was raised to the peerage as Viscount Long, of Wraxall in the County of Wiltshire, in May 1921.The Times (Monday, 23 May 1921, p. 10); (Tuesday, 31 May 1921, p. 10).  Personal life  Lord Long married Lady Dorothy (Doreen) Blanche, daughter of the 9th Earl of Cork and Orrery, in 1878.

Doug Geeslin, a Fargo-based investor, purchased the company from its founder. In 2004 Sterion, a medical devices company later renamed Sten Corporation, purchased Burger Time from Geeslin. Sten was controlled by Gary Copperud, president of CMM Properties, and CEO Kenneth Brimmer, a former president of Rainforest Cafe. On April 29, 2007, Sten sold Burger Time to BTND LLC, a Colorado limited liability company owned by Copperud and Jeffrey A. Zinnecker and accepted all liabilities. The duo resigned from Sten's board of directors. Types Burger Time primarily operates outdoor restaurants which offer only drive-through or walk up service. There is typically an outdoor seating area available as well as extra parking for customers who wish to eat in their vehicles. Products The company's menu includes hamburgers, french fries, soft drinks, and other typical fast food fare, sold in combinations or a la carte.

The monastery land formerly belonged to Simeon Khovrin, a boyar of Greek extraction and progenitor of the great clan of Golovins. He took monastic vows in the cloister under the name Simon (hence the name); many of his descendants are also buried there. In 1379, the monastery was moved half a mile to the east. Its original location, where bodies of the warriors killed in the Battle of Kulikovo had been buried, is still commemorated by the old Simonov church. During the 15th century, the cloister was the richest in Moscow. Among the learned monks who lived and worked there were Vassian Patrikeyev and Maximus the Greek. A white stone cathedral was erected in 1405; it was later enlarged by order of Ivan the Terrible. As the monastery defended southern approaches to Moscow, it was heavily fortified in the 1640s. The last addition to the complex was a huge multi-storied bell-tower, modelled after Ivan the Great Bell Tower of Moscow Kremlin. The monastery was abolished by the Bolsheviks in 1923, and soon thereafter most of its buildings were demolished to make way for an automobile plant. Surviving structures all date back to the 17th century and include three towers of cannon-like appearance and auxiliary buildings in the Naryshkin baroque style.

It is an important and rare example of a late antique scientific text. The 491 vellum folios measure 37 by 30 cm and contain more than 400 pictures of animals and plants, most done in a naturalistic style. In addition to the text by Dioscorides, the manuscript has appended to it the Carmen de herbis attributed to Rufus, a paraphrase of an ornithological treatise by a certain Dionysius, usually identified with Dionysius of Philadelphia, and a paraphrase of Nicander's treatise on the treatment of snake bites. The manuscript was created in about 515 AD in the Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire's capital, Constantinople, for a resident byzantine imperial princess, Anicia Juliana, the daughter of Anicius Olybrius, who had been one of the last of the Western Roman Emperors. The manuscript is accordingly now called the Juliana Anicia Codex by scholars.The 1500th Anniversary (512-2012) of the Juliana Anicia Codex: An Illustrated Dioscoridean Recension.

Chronica horticulturae. 52(3) 2012 pp. 9-15 Although it was created as a luxury copy, in later centuries it was used daily as a textbook in the imperial hospital of Constantinople, and a medieval note records that a Greek nurse there, named Nathanael, had it rebound in 1406.Mazal, Otto. \\"Der Wiener Dioscurides\\" vol. 1, p. 16 After residing in Constantinople for just over a thousand years, the text passed to the Holy Roman Emperor in Vienna in the 1500s, a century after the city fell to the Ottomans. Throughout the Byzantine period the manuscript was used as the original for copies of the work that were given to foreign leaders, including the Arabic edition of Abd al-Rahman III of Spain for the creation of which the Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII sent a Greek copy and a translator.Mazal, Otto. \\"Der Wiener Dioscurides\\" vol. 2, p. 89 A note recording the name of one Michael of the Varangian Guard is also found in the text.Mazal, Otto. \\"Der Wiener Dioscurides\\" vol. 1, p. 16 The manuscript was restored and a table of contents and extensive scholia added in Byzantine Greek minuscule, by the patriarchal notary John Chortasmenos in 1406.Janick, Jules, and John Stolarczyk. \\"Ancient Greek illustrated Dioscoridean herbals: origins and impact of the Juliana Anicia Codex and the Codex Neopolitanus.\\" Notulae Botanicae Horti Agrobotanici Cluj-Napoca 40.1 (2012): 09. In the mid 1400s it was used to create the Pope Alexander VII Dioscorides, now in the Vatican Library, by the monks of St. John the Baptist Greek orthodox monastery in Constantinople. After the fall of Constantinople in 1453 a subsequent owner handwrote each plant's name in Arabic and Hebrew. The manuscript, still in Istanbul a century after the fall of the city, was purchased from Moses Hamon, the Arabic-speaking, Jewish physician to sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, by the Flemish diplomat Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq, who was in the employ of Emperor Ferdinand I of the Austrian Habsburgs. The manuscript is now held in the √ñsterreichische Nationalbibliothek in Vienna, where it is identified as the Codex Vindobonensis med. gr. 1.\\" The manuscript was inscribed on UNESCO's Memory of the World Programme Register in 1997 in recognition of its historical significance. Illustrations The manuscript has 383 extant full-page illustrations of plants out of the original 435 illustrations. The illustrations fall into two groups. There are those that faithfully follow earlier classical models and present a quite naturalistic illustration of each plant. There are also other illustrations that are more abstract. The majority of the illustrations were painted in a naturalistic style so as to aid a pharmacologist in the recognition of each plant. However, it is believed that these illustrations were made as copies of an earlier herbal and were not drawn from nature. European Bramble In addition to the illustrations of the text, the manuscript contains several frontispieces in the form of a series of full-page miniatures. Of special note is the dedication miniature portrait of Anicia Juliana on folio 6 verso. (See here.) The manuscript was presented to Anicia out of gratitude for her funding the construction of a church in the suburbs of Constantinople. This portrait is the oldest extant dedication portrait. The portrait has Anicia seated in a ceremonial pose distributing alms. She is flanked by personifications of Magnanimity and Prudence. At her feet, another personification, labeled \\"Gratitude of the Arts\\", kneels. A putto holds a dedication copy up to Anicia. Anicia and her attendants are enclosed within an eight-point star within a circle all formed of intertwined rope. Within the outer spandrels of the star are putti, done in grisaille, working as masons and carpenters. This miniature is an altogether original creation and, with the inclusion of the personifications and the putti, shows the endurance of the classical tradition in Constantinople, despite the fact that Anicia herself was a pious Christian. The series of frontispieces in the manuscript begins with two full-page miniatures, each having a group of seven noted pharmacologists. In the second picture (folio 3 verso, see here), the most prominent and only one sitting on a chair is Galen. He is flanked by three pairs of other physicians, seated on stones or the ground. Closest to Galen are Crateuas and Dioscurides. The second pair are Apollonius Mys and Nicander. Farthest from Galen are Andreas and Rufus. Each of the figures is a self-contained portrait and was probably modeled on authors' portraits from the various authors' treatises. The seven figures are contained within an elaborate decorated frame. The background is solid gold, which places the figures in an abstract space. This is the earliest known manuscript to use a solid gold background. Folio 3v, seven physicians Following the two miniatures of seven pharmacologists, there are two author portraits. In the second portrait (see here), Dioscurides sits writing in a codex on his lap. He is shown in profile, which corresponds to the portrait in the previous miniature. It is possible that there was a tradition based on Dioscurides' life portrait that the images are based on. In front of Dioscurides is an artist, seated at a lower level, painting an illustration of the mandrake root. He is painting from nature. The mandrake root he is looking at is held by the personification of Epinoia (the power of thought). There is architectural background consisting of a colonnade with a central niche. The paraphrase of the treatise on birds by Dionysius is in three books. The first two books have illustrations of the birds inserted into the text columns without frame or background (for example, see here). The third book has 24 birds arranged in a grid on a full-page miniature (see illustration above). The birds portrayed throughout the treatise are of high artistic merit and are faithful to nature in form and color. Most of the birds are easily identifiable. Some of the birds contained in the full-page miniature in the third book are not described in the text of the paraphrase. It is probable that these illustrations are based on the illustrations from an older, different treatise, possibly that of Alexander of Myndus. This manuscript, however, is the oldest surviving illustrated treatise on birds.

Biography =The Albigensian Crusade= His father departed on the Albigensian Crusade in 1209. It is unknown when Amaury joined him in the south, but he could possibly arrive in spring 1210, when his mother came there bringing reinforcements for his father. He was knighted on 24 June 1213 in Castelnaudary in the course of a particularly solemn ceremonyA very detailed description can be found in the Histoire des croisades contre les Albigeois by J.J. Barrau et B. Darragon, Paris : A. Lacour, 1840 and continued to fight under his father's command until his death at Toulouse on 25 June 1218. As his father's successor, he inherited the County of Toulouse (that his father had taken from Raymond VI of Toulouse as a reward for his role in the Crusade) and other titles and lands in Languedoc. In 1224, he ceded his titles and lands in Languedoc to King Louis VIII. In exchange, Montfort-l'Amaury was elevated to a county, and several years later, in 1230, Amaury succeeded his uncle Mathieu II of Montmorency as Constable of France. =County of Leicester: a Difficult Heritage= His father inherited the county of Leicester from his mother, Amicie de Beaumont, daughter of Robert III de Beaumont. After his death, Amaury became count of Leicester, but, as a liegeman of the French king, he could not be a vassal of the King of England at the same time. By 1230, Amaury and Simon, his only surviving brother, decided to split their father's inheritance: Amaury would retain Montfort-l'Amaury in France, and Simon would receive Leicester in England. However, the affair lasted for almost a decade: only on 11 April 1239 Amaury officially renounced his rights in England, and King Henry III recognised Simon as earl of Leicester.The most detailed description can be found in the book Simon de Montfort by J.R. Maddicott, Cambridge University Press, 1996. =The Barons' Crusade= In 1239 he departed for the Holy Land on a Barons' Crusade with Theobald I of Navarre, Hugh IV, Duke of Burgundy and many other prominent nobles of the realm. The King Louis IX did not go on crusade, but gave the expedition a royal character by permitting Amaury to carry the Fleur- de-lys.Jacques Le Goff, Saint Louis, Folio, 31 d√©cembre 1999, 1280 p., p. 215 On 13 November 1239, he was taken prisoner during a disastrous battle under Henry of Bar at Gaza, during which Henry was killed, and led to Egypt with six hundred other prisoners. He spent the next 18 months in the dungeons of Cairo where he was treated more severely than the other prisoners because he would not tell the sultan who were the other prisoners.Matthieu Paris, Grande chronique de Matthieu Paris, tome cinqui√®me, Paris, Paulin, 1840 He was freed on 23 April 1241, along with other French prisoners, after the crusaders under Richard of Cornwall and the sultan of Egypt have concluded an alliance against the sultan of Damascus. He died in Otranto later the same year on his way home and was buried, at the Pope's order, in St. Peter's Basilica; his heart, according to his own wish at his death, was brought to the Abbey of Haute- Bruy√®re near Montfort-l'Amaury where Aubry Le Cornu, bishop of Chartres, enclosed it in an effigy.M.-J.

Life Frere was born in Roydon Hall, Norfolk, the son of Sheppard Frere and Susanna Hatley. Ellenor Fenn was his sister.thepeerage.com John Frere In 1766, Frere received his MA from Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he was Second Wrangler and was elected to a fellowship. He subsequently held several political offices and was appointed High Sheriff of Suffolk for 1776‚Äì77. He was elected a member of parliament for Norwich from 1799 to 1802. Antiquary An interest in the past, instigated by observing worked stone tools in a clay mining pit, led him to become a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London and the Royal Society and to conduct excavations at a site just south of Hoxne, 8 km east, and across the River Waveney, from his home in Roydon, near Diss. Frere wrote a letter to the Society of Antiquaries about flint tools and large bones of extinct animals found at a depth of approximately twelve feet (four meters) in a hole dug by local brickworkers. He described the worked stones as \\"...weapons of war, fabricated and used by a people who had not the use of metals... The situation in which these weapons were found may tempt us to refer them to a very remote period indeed, even beyond that of the present world....\\" In addition, Frere carefully described the stratigraphy of the find, with the tools lying below an apparent ancient sea floor, yet not in a position to which they could have been washed down. Although Frere's letter was officially read at the Society on 22 June 1797, and published by it in 1800, his interpretation was so radical by the standards of the day as to be overlooked for six decades, until noticed by John Evans.See Ronald Singer et al., The Lower Paleolithic Site at Hoxne, England (University of Chicago Press, 1993) for the letter, Evans find and later investigations and evaluations of the site, also paleoanthropologist Mary Leakey, Disclosing the Past: An Autobiography, Garden City, New York: Doubleday, 1984, p. 15. (Leakey was a direct descendant of John Frere through her mother, Cecilia Marion Frere.)Antiquarian John Frere/ Freer Family Genealogy Research includes the text of Frere's \\"Letter to The Rev. John Brand, Secretary, Read June 22, 1797\\". Frere's is considered one of the most important middle Pleistocene sites in Europe, because of what he observed in his letter: juxtaposition of artefacts, animal remains and stratigraphic evidence. Its significance is double: for paleoanthropology, showing Homo presence in Britain approximately 400,000 years ago, and, for geology, dating stages of the European Great Interglacial period (known in Britain as the Hoxnian).Chris Stringer, Homo Britannicus (Penguin, 2006), p. 84.

It borders Bloomfield and East Orange. To the neighborhood's immediate east is the Newark City Subway and Branch Brook Park. Roseville is divided into Upper Roseville north of 3rd Ave and Lower Roseville south of 3rd Ave. Originally called \\"Rowesville,\\" Roseville was farmland at the time of the Civil War, but during the conflict most of the area was turned into Union Army training and camping grounds. Residential development began with the construction of Newark's first streetcar line in 1862, and expanded greatly in the 1880s. Growth was also spurred by the Delaware, Lackawanna, & Western Railroad, which maintained a train station in Roseville for many years (closed in 1982 by New Jersey Transit). For generations, Roseville received Newarkers who had acquired the prosperity to leave the crowded tenements of the Ironbound and the central part of the city. At the turn of the century, the northern section of the district was predominantly Irish-American, but the rest of the neighborhood was not associated with any single ethnic group. Most of the residents, however, were Catholic and St. Rose of Lima Church was an important part of neighborhood life. In the 1950s and 1960s, the proportion of African American residents increased. However, since the 1970s, increasing numbers of Hispanic families have moved into the neighborhood, hailing from Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic and various Latin American mainland countries. From 1929 to 1964 Roseville was Newark Academy's third home. The school had a large campus on First Street, between Seventh Avenue and Orange Street. The building was torn down in 1965 and replaced by apartments. St Rose of Lima Church Roseville has a tradition of community organization. In 1930 the citizens of Roseville founded the Roseville Community Council, the first grass-roots neighborhood improvement society in Newark. In the wake of the 1967 Newark civil unrest, the pastor of St. Rose of Lima Church, Monsignor William J. Linder, founded the New Community Corporation, a non-profit organization providing job training, housing and medical care. A major landmark of Roseville is Newark Schools Stadium, located at the corner of Roseville Avenue and Bloomfield Avenue.Stanmyre, Matthew. \\"Construction of new super site finally underway at iconic Newark Schools Stadium\\", The Star-Ledger, July 19, 2009.

Roseville is served by the Orange Street, Park Avenue and Bloomfield Avenue Stations of Newark City Subway. Educational institutions include: First Avenue Elementary School, Dr. William. H. Horton School, Alma Flagg Elementary School, Sussex Avenue School, Roseville Avenue School, Newark Preschool, St. Rose of Lima School, and St. Frances Xavier School. The historic Roseville Presbyterian Church, incorporated in 1854, is located on Roseville Ave between I-280 and Sussex Avenue. It was originally started by middle class residents from nearby East Orange and is now a predominantly African American congregation.

The FCS style can be used as the traditional tri-fin placement, a four (quad), or a five fin set up. The tri-fin refers to a setup with three fins on the underside of the board, often with the two outer fins angled inward and middle fin a few inches closer to the end of the tail pointed straight and larger. The five fin placement is similar but with four outer fins and one middle fin (these fins are often smaller). The quad fin setup has 4 outer fins but no middle fin. Some styles enable the rider to adjust the fore and aft positioning of the fin. The injection molded fins are designed to break off in the event of collision to minimize board damage and injury to the surfer. Design The FCS system was designed by Brian A. Whitty in Elanora, Australia, and patented on November 7, 1995. It can be recognized by the 2 tabs on the fins which are designed to fit into a securing plug that attaches the fin to the board. The fin tabs are placed in slots which are set into the board by the use of a plug that fits flush with the underside of the board. They are secured into these plugs by the use of set screws which can be tightened down by a fin key or Allen wrench. The plug design and use of set screws enables the fin to be easily removed and installed for storage or travel. These plugs can be installed in a variety of different ways in order to create the correct degree of strength needed for the fin to function. The more common method is to drill the plug hole at the end of the shaping process and then secure the plug in the hole with resin. The plug attaches through the use of the ‚ÄúH-pattern‚Äù which binds at both the deck and bottom of the board fiberglass to the plug which provide the most strength at the fin without permanent installation through glassing on (same as laying on fiberglass). A version of FCS (Fusion) had been designed to be installed before the surfboard blank is covered with fiberglass and is the preferred version of FCS for epoxy surfboards. In September 2013, FCS introduced FCS II a new pre-glass fin system to the market. The new system boasts a number of key advantages over its predecessors. Firstly, the need for any screws or tool to secure the fins has been eliminated; the fins now simply lock into the plugs. Secondly, the leading edge of the fin resides inside the plug, and the base of the fins sit flush to the surface of the board creating a more seamless connection. The final key feature of the new system is that it's backward compatible, meaning it will accept fins from the original dual tab system. Adding two grub screws and a small silicon insert allows you to secure your two tab fins into the new system. Many consider the new system inferior, Channel Islands Surfboards parted with FCS after the new system and Kelly Slater continues to surf the original FCS tabs on his Komunity Project fins.http://www.cisurfboards.com/2013/future-fins-become-official-fin-partner- for-ci-surfboards/ Selected riders http://www.wavescape.co.za/surf- news/breaking-news/kelly-parts-with-fcs.html *CJ Hobgood *Damien Hobgood *Adriano DeSouza *Mark Occhilupo *Sunny Garcia *Oscar Wright *Tom Carroll *Jarrad House *Julian Wilson *Gabriel Medina *Mick Fanning *Filipe Toledo *Kolohe Andino *Jeremy Flores See also *List of companies of Australia References External links The battle of the Fins: Futures vs. FCS.

It is located in the Upper Rhine valley on the tourist theme routes \\"Baden Asparagus Route\\" () and Bertha Benz Memorial Route. The town is widely known for its Hockenheimring, a motor racing course, which has hosted over 30 Formula One German Grand Prix races since 1970. Hockenheim is one of the six largest towns in the Rhein-Neckar- Kreis district; since 1999 the number of inhabitants exceeded the 20,000 threshold, thus the town received the status of a regional central town (Gro√üe Kreisstadt) in 2001. It is twinned with the French town of Commercy, the German town of Hohenstein-Ernstthal in Saxony and the American town of Mooresville, North Carolina. Geography =Location and environment= Hockenheim is located in the Upper Rhine valley on an old trade route from Frankfurt to Basel. The brook Kraichbach divides the town in an eastern and a smaller western area, and flows into the Rhine to the north near Ketsch. Hockenheim's total municipal area covers 3,484 ha, with ca. 28.8 percent used for settlement and transportation and ca. 45.9 percent for agriculture. The remaining area consists of ca. 22 percent forests and ca. 2.4 percent rivers and seas. Fl√§chenerhebung 2011, Hockenheim, Stadt Statistisches Landesamt Baden-W√ºrttemberg, data as of 31. December 2011. Retrieved 3 January 2013. The municipal area is divided into two large natural regions, the \\"Rheinaue\\" to the west and the slightly higher \\"Niederterrasse\\" to the east. The so-called \\"Hockenheimer Rheinbogen\\" is a meander area of the Rhine, which stretches over the municipalities of Ketsch, Hockenheim and Altlu√üheim. 30 parts of it with a total of 656 ha are under nature conservation. An additional area three times larger is designated as landscape conservation area, with less strict usage limitations. The \\"Rheinbogen\\" offers biologically diverse, secondary wetlands as habitat for endangered plants and animals, it is also an internationally important resting and feeding area for migrating birds in winter. Hockenheimer Rheinbogen, Pflanzen und Tiere Landesanstalt f√ºr Umwelt, Messungen und Naturschutz Baden-W√ºrttemberg. Retrieved 3 April 2011. =Town structure= The central urban area forms one unit and is only divided into five districts for statistical purposes. Together with the central town several small settlements belong to Hockenheim: the industrial areas \\"Bahnstation Talhaus\\" and \\"Wasserwerk\\", the farms and houses \\"Insultheimerhof\\", \\"Herrenteich, Ziegelei\\" and \\"Ketschau, Ziegelei‚Äú as well as the deserted settlement \\"Westeheim\\". History Hockenheim and surroundings 1907 Stamped bricks of the Roman Legio XIV Gemina Martia Victrix were found 1984 in a brick kiln during an excavation in Hockenheim. The stationing of this legion near Mainz from 71AD until 92AD indicates an early settlement in this area. Ulrich Brandl und Emmi Federhofer: Ton + Technik. R√∂mische Ziegel. Theiss, Stuttgart 2010, (Schriften des Limesmuseums Aalen. Nr. 61) Hockenheim was first mentioned 769 as \\"Ochinheim\\" in a donation document of the Lorsch Codex, an early monastery gift documentation. The name \\"Hockenheim\\" itself appeared first in 1238 in official documents. In the Middle Ages Hockenheim was owned by several alternating local authorities: the castle district Wersau, the Diocese of Speyer during the 12th and 13th century, various Palatinate (\\"Pfalz\\") rulers since 1286 and the Electoral Palatinate (\\"Kurpfalz\\") since 1462. In the 17th century Hockenheim was severely devastated twice by French troops, 1644 in the Thirty Years' War and 1674 in the Franco-Dutch War. During this period the former cultivation of hops in the area was partly replaced with tobacco, brought into the country by the French. 1803 the Electoral Palatinate was dissolved and the village was integrated in Baden. With the growing tobacco crop the village flourished and was awarded town rights on 22 July 1895 by Frederick I, Grand Duke of Baden. With the beginning of the 20th century asparagus cultivation replaced most of the remaining hops industry. At 29 May 1932 the Hockenheimring was opened with a motorcycle race. After World War II the decline of the cigar industry had begun, but Hockenheim was already known for its Hockenheimring and could expand in other industrial branches. January 1973 Hockenheim was assigned to the newly formed Rhein-Neckar-Kreis district. In 1991, Hockenheim was the host of the 11th Baden-W√ºrttemberg State Horticultural Show. Politics Town hall The town is led by the Lord Mayor (\\"Oberb√ºrgermeister\\"), who is elected directly by the population every 8 years; since 2004 this office is held by Dieter Gummer (SPD). Its Permanent Representative is the \\"Erste Beigeordnete\\", with the office designation of mayor (\\"B√ºrgermeister\\"). As of the local election on 25 May 2014, the local council of Hockenheim consists of 22 members, who hold the title \\"Stadtraetin/Stadtrat\\", and the Lord Mayor presiding the council. In 1975 the Hockenheim government agreed upon a municipal association (\\"Verwaltungsgemeinschaft\\") with the neighboring villages Altlu√üheim, Neulu√üheim and Reilingen. Hockenheim is one of the six largest towns in the Rhein-Neckar-Kreis district; since 1999 the number of inhabitants exceeds the 20,000 threshold, thus the town received the status of a regional central town (\\"Gro√üe Kreisstadt\\") in 2001. Coat of arms Adopted in 1609, the coat of arms of Hockenheim has diagonally crossed silver hooks in a sign, below a crowned golden lion. The lion is the animal of the Electoral Palatinate, to which Hockenheim belonged; the hooks are probably derived from the place name. The form of the symbols was changed several times, but has been specified in its current form by municipal law since 1895. Sport The Hockenheimring The Hockenheimring, a motor racing course built in 1932, has become the home of the Formula One German Grand Prix. It has hosted this event over 30 times since 1970, including every year between 1986 and 2006. Since 2007 Formula One races in Germany are alternating annually between the Hockenheimring and the N√ºrburgring; Hockenheim hosts the event on even years. The course is also used for several other motor racing events and open-air concerts. After Nurburgring's withdrawal from 2015, Hockenheimring started hosting German Grand Prix annually since 2018. However, the track ownership and management and Formula One Management have not yet agreed a deal to extend the track's holding of the German Grand Prix beyond 2019. Places of interest Protestant town church A museum for tobacco cultivation was founded 1984 as the first of its kind in Baden-W√ºrttemberg. The motorsport museum opened near the Hockenheimring in 1986 and shows over 200 exhibits of historical motorcycles and engines. The \\"Gartenschaupark\\" was created in 1991 to host the State Horticultural Show and is, with an area of 16 ha, Hockenheim's largest park. Hockenheim's landmark is the water tower, constructed in 1910 in Art Nouveau. Other buildings of historical significance include the Protestant town church, a 1906 Neo-baroque building by architect Hermann Behaghel, and the Catholic Church (1910), done in Art Nouveau with a high tower, by Johannes Schroth. The old Catholic church, with a classical hall (1817) and a late Gothic choir tower (1490), serves as a community center today.

He won the 1963 Caldecott Medal for illustrating The Snowy Day, which he also wrote. Keats wrote A Letter to Amy and Hi, Cat! but he was most famous for The Snowy Day. It is considered one of the most important American books of the 20th century. Keats is best known for introducing multiculturalism into mainstream American children's literature. He was one of the first children‚Äôs book authors to use an urban setting for his stories and he developed the use of collage as a medium for illustration. Biography Ezra Jack Keats was born Jacob Ezra Katz on March 11, 1916 in East New York, Brooklyn, the third child of Polish- Jewish immigrants Benjamin Katz and Augusta Podgainy. The family was very poor. Jack, as he was known, was artistic from an early age, and joyfully made pictures out of whatever scraps of wood, cloth and paper that he could collect. Benjamin Katz, who worked as a waiter, tried to discourage his son, insisting that artists lived terrible, impoverished lives. Nevertheless, he sometimes brought home tubes of paint, claiming, \\"A starving artist swapped this for a bowl of soup.\\" With little encouragement at home, Keats sought validation for his skills at school and learned about art at the public library. He received a medal for drawing on graduating from Junior High School 149. Although unimpressive-looking, the medal meant a great deal to him, and he kept it his entire life. Keats attended Thomas Jefferson High School, where he won a national contest run by Scholastic for an oil painting depicting hobos warming themselves around a fire. At his graduation, in January 1935, he was to receive the senior class medal for excellence in art. Two days before the ceremony, Benjamin Katz died in the street of a heart attack. When Keats identified his father's body, he later wrote, \\"I found myself staring deep into his secret feelings. There in his wallet were worn and tattered newspaper clippings of the notices of the awards I had won. My silent admirer and supplier, he had been torn between his dread of my leading a life of hardship and his real pride in my work.\\" His father's death curtailed his dream of attending art school. For the remainder of the Great Depression until he was drafted for military service in World War II, Keats took art classes when he could and worked at a number of jobs, most notably as a mural painter under the New Deal program the Works Progress Administration (WPA) and as a comic book illustrator. At Fawcett Publications, he illustrated backgrounds for the Captain Marvel comic strip. He spent his military service (1943‚Äì45) designing camouflage patterns for the U.S. Army Air Force. In 1947 he petitioned to legally change his name to Ezra Jack Keats, in reaction to the anti-Semitic prejudice of the time. Keats spent most of 1949 painting and studying in Paris, realizing a long-deferred dream of working as an artist. After returning to New York, he focused on earning a living as a commercial artist, undoubtedly influenced by his father's anxieties. His illustrations began to appear in Reader's Digest, The New York Times Book Review, Collier's and Playboy, and on the jackets of popular books. His work was displayed in Fifth Avenue store windows, and the Associated American Artists Gallery, in New York City, gave him exhibitions in 1950 and 1954. In his unpublished autobiography, Keats wrote, \\"I didn't even ask to get into children's books.\\" In fact, he was asked to do so by Elizabeth Riley of Crowell, which brought out his first children's title, Jubilant for Sure, written by Elisabeth Hubbard Lansing, in 1954. To prepare for the assignment, Keats went to rural Kentucky, where the story takes place, to sketch. Many children's books followed, including the Danny Dunn adventure series, by Jay Williams and Raymond Abrashkin, and an ethnographic series by Tillie S. Pine and Joseph Levine, beginning with The Indians Knew. All told, Keats illustrated nearly 70 books written by other authors. In 1983, Keats died at the age of 67 following a heart attack. His last projects included designing the sets for a musical version of his book The Trip (which would later become the stage production Captain Louie), designing a poster for The New Theater of Brooklyn, and writing and illustrating a retelling of the folktale \\"The Giant Turnip.\\" He never married and often said that his characters were his children. After his death, the Ezra Jack Keats Foundation, which he had established in 1964, became active. Under the administration of his close friends Martin and Lillie Pope, the foundation was dedicated to preserving the quality of Keats' books and artworks, promoting children's literacy and creativity, and maintaining quality and diversity in children's literature. One of the Foundation's program is the Ezra Jack Keats Book Award. The Keats Archive, which includes original artwork and correspondence, is housed at the University of Southern Mississippi as part of the de Grummond Children's Literature Collection. Books Keats' works have been translated into some 20 languages, including Japanese, French, Danish, Norwegian, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Turkish, German, Swedish, Thai, Chinese, and Korean. My Dog Is Lost was Keats' first attempt at writing his own children's book, co-authored with Pat Cherr, in 1960. The main character, Juanito, is an eight-year-old Spanish speaker newly arrived in New York City from Puerto Rico who has lost his dog. Searching throughout the city, he is helped by children in Chinatown, Little Italy, Park Avenue and Harlem. In this early work, Keats incorporated Spanish words into the story and featured minority children as central characters. Two years later, Viking published The Snowy Day, which received the Caldecott Medal for the most distinguished picture book for children in 1963. The story follows a very young boy named Peter as he spends a day playing in the snow. Peter is African-American, although his race is never mentioned. Peter was inspired by a Life magazine clipping from 1940. Keats wrote, \\"Then began an experience that turned my life around ‚Äî working on a book with a black kid as hero. None of the manuscripts I'd been illustrating featured any black kids ‚Äî except for token blacks in the background. My book would have him there simply because he should have been there all along.\\" After years of illustrating books written by others, Keats found a voice of his own through Peter. The techniques that give The Snowy Day its unique look ‚Äî collage with cutouts of patterned paper fabric and oilcloth; handmade stamps; spatterings of India ink with a toothbrush ‚Äî were methods Keats had never used before. \\"I was like a child playing,\\" he wrote. \\"I was in a world with no rules.\\" The Snowy Day was one of 22 books written and illustrated by Keats, and more than any other, became a classic of children's literature. Peter appears in a total of seven books, during which he grows and matures: Whistle for Willie, Peter's Chair, A Letter to Amy, Goggles!, Hi, Cat! and Pet Show!. Keats skillfully weaves into his plots a sense of the dilemmas and even dangers his protagonists face. In The Snowy Day Peter, about four years old, yearns to join a snowball fight but learns he is too small when a stray snowball knocks him down. Later, he learns how to assume the role of older brother (Peter's Chair), to stand up to his friends when he invites a girl to his birthday party (A Letter to Amy), and to avoid the violence of a gang of older boys (Goggles!). One of Keats' signature story elements is that the children in his books are consistently challenged with real problems that are recognizable to young readers; in solving them, the characters learn and mature. In a later series of four books beginning with Louie, Keats introduces a silent, lonely and brooding child who responds to a puppet during a puppet show with a joyous Hello! Louie lives largely in his imagination, constructing a diorama in a shoebox and escaping into it in The Trip, and building a spaceship out of detritus and traveling among the planets in Regards to the Man in the Moon. But he is resilient enough to search for a candidate for a stepfather, and find one, in Louie's Search, and to learn to stand up to taunts from other children. Keats has said that Louie is the character he most related to, having felt invisible and unloved as a child and escaping through his creative pursuits. Many of Keats' stories portray family life and the simple pleasures in a child's daily routine. Jennie's Hat illustrates the excitement of a child anticipating a present. Goggles! tells the story of boys finding a pair of goggles, and the chase that follows when a gang of bullies wants them, too. Keats drew on his own experiences growing up, often offering positive outcomes as an antidote to his unhappy childhood. Yet the particular events and environments in Keats' stories have an emotional resonance that children around the world have responded to. This was certainly his intention. Keats said, \\"I wanted The Snowy Day to be a chunk of life, the sensory experience in word and picture of what it feels like to hear your own body making sounds in the snow. Crunch...crunch...And the joy of being alive.\\" After The Snowy Day, Keats blended collage with gouache, an opaque watercolor mixed with a gum that produced an oil-like glaze. He marbled paper and worked with acrylics and watercolor, pen and ink and even photographs. The simplicity and directness of The Snowy Day gave way to more complex and painterly compositions, such as the expressionistic illustrations in Apt. 3. In his evolution from fine artist to children's book illustrator, Ezra applied influences and techniques that had inspired him as a painter, from Cubism to abstraction, within a cohesive, and often highly dramatic, narrative structure. His artwork also demonstrates an enormous emotional range, swinging from exuberant whimsy to deep desolation and back again. Honors and memorials PS 253, Brooklyn Among the many honors Keats received for his 20-year contribution to children‚Äôs literature are: * The Snowy Day was awarded the Caldecott Medal and named one of the 150 most influential books of the 20th century by the New York Public Library. * Keats was the first artist invited to design greeting cards for UNICEF. * A skating rink in Kiyose, Japan, was named after him, in honor of his book Skates!. * Keats was a member of the White House Forum on Child Development and the Mass Media and appeared on the celebrated PBS show Mister Rogers' Neighborhood several times; Sesame Street featured his book Peter's Chair, read aloud by First Lady Barbara Bush. * He was awarded The University of Southern Mississippi Silver Medallion in 1980 during the Fay B. Kaigler Children's Book Festival as outstanding children's book author-illustrator. * The city of Portland, Oregon, honored him with a parade, as did his readers in Tokyo, Japan. * The Imagination Playground was set up by the Prospect Park Alliance in Brooklyn, New York, based on the characters from Keats' books.

Background Born in Osaka to Grace and Isaac Dooman, the latter of whom was an Anglican missionary, Dooman knew Japanese as a native language. His parents were from Urmia, Iran, where the predominant Christians were ethnic Assyrians, and came to Japan following the completion of Isaac's training at the General Theological Union in New York in 1888 because Isaac found himself unable to return to his native Persia. Dooman came to the United States in 1903 and attended Trinity School in New York. He graduated from Trinity College in 1911. Career Dooman joined the State Department in 1912 as a Student Interpreter after a competitive examination and spent more than thirty years in US government service.Eugene Dooman, Official Personnel File, National Personnel Records Center, National Archives and Records Administration, St. Louis, MO. Dooman spent much of his diplomatic career in Japan with a two-year stint in London (1931‚Äì33) and five years in Washington (1933‚Äì37). He left Japan in 1941. Earlier that year (February 14) as US embassy counselor, he delivered Franklin D. Roosevelt‚Äôs ultimatum to the Japanese Foreign Ministry in Tokyo, which warned that, if Japan attacked Singapore, it would mean war with the United States. By the time of the crucial negotiations with Japan in the late 1930s, Dooman was Counselor of the Embassy, the number two to Ambassador Joseph C. Grew. He frequently served as charge d'affaires ad interim during Grew's absences, including Grew's home leave in 1939. Dooman was interned on the embassy compound after Pearl Harbor, and returned to the US on the Swedish exchange vessel Gripsholm. Later, in 1945, Dooman was involved with his old chief, now Acting Secretary of State Joseph Grew as Special Assistant to Assistant Secretary of State James Dunn in the decision over calling for Japanese surrender. Dooman was one of the drafters of the Potsdam Proclamation, a warning to Japan in 1945 prior to the dropping of atomic bombs. Dooman was opposed to the use of atomic weapons against Japan and a strong advocate for retaining the Emperor. Dooman was strongly anti-communist in his retirement years after the war, and participated in the Senator William Jenner \\"witchhunt\\" of 1957 focusing wild accusations on the alleged communist sympathies of Canadian diplomat and scholar Herbert Norman and the distinguished American diplomat (later himself Minister-Counselor in the Tokyo embassy) John Emmerson.John Emmerson, The Silver Thread Later life In 1960, the Government of Japan awarded him the Order of the Rising Sun, Second Class, in recognition of his \\"long and meritorious service in the advancement of Japanese-American relations and in the building of a new Japan.\\" Interviewed in 1962 as part of Columbia University‚Äôs oral history project, his reminiscences about the Occupation of Japan have provided useful material for historians.

It is named after former Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, a native of Cork. It takes the road under the River Lee. North of the tunnel, the ring-road joins the M8 motorway to Dublin (north) and N8 road to the city centre (west), with the N25 commencing east to Waterford. The tunnel was completed in May 1999, and carried nearly 40,000 vehicles per day as of 2005. This number rose further as the N40 ring-road's upgrades progressed, with the opening of the Kinsale road roundabout flyover in 2006 and subsequent upgrades to the Sarsfield Road and Bandon Road Roundabouts. Traffic in 2015 was 63,000 vehicles a day up from 59,000 in 2013. The tunnel has two cells, each with two traffic lanes and two footpaths, and a central bore for use in an emergency only. Pedestrians and cyclists are expressly forbidden from using the tunnel. The exclusion of cyclists has been somewhat controversial as the feeder road is a dual- carriageway and so is open to cyclists, but the by-law is applied because of space limitations and the obvious danger of cyclists in an enclosed tunnel. History Jack Lynch Tunnel commemorative plaque The idea of a crossing of the River Lee downstream of the city came from civil engineers employed by Cork Local Authorities and the central government's Department of the Environment in the late 1970s. Cork's suburbs were expanding and traffic was rising as car ownership increased, but the city centre's street plan, laid out in the late Middle Ages, was ill-equipped to cope. The engineers reasoned that the congestion in the city centre and its radial routes was quickly reaching intolerable levels. They pushed through Cork's \\"LUTS\\" ‚Äì Land Use and Transportation Study ‚Äì plan,Greater Cork Area Land Use/Transportation Study. Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, the MVA Consultancy, and LUTS Team. Cork 1976 to lay down a twenty five-year plan for the orderly growth of transport and land use in the greater Cork area. The transportation proposals combined construction of elements of a ring road, a downstream crossing, and computerised management of traffic on existing roads. This group of engineers became the Technical Steering Committee for the LUTS Plan and at that time consisted of Sean McCarthy, the former City Engineer, W.A. \\"Liam\\" Fitzgerald, his successor as City Engineer, Liam Mullins, Cork's County Engineer, John O'Regan, his deputy, B.J. O'Sullivan, the Cork Harbour Engineer, and Sean Walsh and Declan O'Driscoll, the two Assistant Chief Engineering Advisers at the Department of the Environment responsible for the region.Bardas Chorcai; Down-Stream Crossing of the River Lee, Feasibility Study. DeLeuw Chadwick O'hEocha, Consulting Engineers, November 1981 The location and type of crossing was not established by the LUTS plan. No road development in Ireland prior to that date had required such a large investment,Seanad √âireann ‚Äì Volume 122 ‚Äì 17 May 1989 Adjournment Matter: Cork City River Crossing. http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/S/0122/S.0122.198905170009.html and therefore the plan met with some opposition on the grounds of cost. In 1980, Cork Corporation commissioned DeLeuw Chadwick O‚ÄôhEocha, engineering consultants, to undertake a feasibility study of options for a major highway crossing of the River Lee downstream from Cork city centre. A team led by J.D. Shinkwin, Director of DeLeuw Chadwick O‚ÄôhEocha, performed the study. The first stage of the report established that the crossing should be located in Dunkettle, rather than at Tivoli, closer to the city centre. The second stage endorsed an immersed tube tunnel as the preferred scheme versus a bridge (either fixed or opening span). The primary reasons were that a tunnel would have a lower construction cost relative to its utility, shorter approach gradients, lower environmental impact and no effect on shipping once built. While the construction costs for a two lane tunnel were marginally higher than for a two lane high-level bridge, the steep upward ramp for a high-level bridge would slow down cars and trucks as they climbed the bridge, thus reducing its peak capacity dramatically versus a tunnel or, alternatively, necessitating the addition of a climbing lane with significant additional costs. The other alternative considered by the Steering Committee was an opening span bridge. While this solution would avoid the ramp problem of a high-level bridge, traffic would halt whenever the bridge had to open. Shipping volumes into Cork's port area was rising steadily in the 1980s, which meant that an opening span bridge was becoming less attractive every year. The N40 at the southern entry/exit point of the tunnel A sworn Public Inquiry into Cork Corporation's application for a \\"bridge order\\" providing for a two-lane tunnel was held in October 1985. The required inspector's report was submitted in January 1987 to the then Minister of the Environment, P√°draig Flynn. At that point, the report remained on the minister's desk for some time. The formal reason for this was that the minister \\"decided that the question of the timing of the crossing should be considered in the broader context of the preparation by the Department of proposals for the medium to long term development of national roads. In this context the operational programme for roads ‚Ä¶ includes the proposal for the commencement of the downstream crossing during the programme period 1989‚Äì1993\\". In 1989, the government recommended a further feasibility study to consider the need for a crossing and the technical, economic and operational aspects of the various crossing options. The study confirmed the findings of the original Feasibility Study. A further Public Inquiry was held, with hearings in July and December 1990, which considered further the alternative of a four lane crossing rather than the planned two lane crossing. In 1992, the Minister approved a Bridge Order for a four lane immersed tube tunnel. In the intervening time, the Irish government had also established the National Roads Authority (NRA) to advance the long term development of the national roads network. Declan O'Driscoll was appointed the Chief Engineer of that authority and together with J.D. Shinkwin, Director of Ewbank Preece OhEocha, and W.A. Fitzgerald, Cork City Engineer, formed an informal Technical Steering Committee for the Tunnel Project. Financing and contracting The IR¬£70 million design and construct contract was awarded by the Cork Corporation on behalf of the National Roads Authority. The NRA received financial assistance from the Cohesion Fund of the European Union. In the early 90s, Ewbank Preece OhEocha (formerly DeLeuw Chadwick OhEocha, and later to become part of Mott MacDonald) supervised a major geotechnical investigation, conducted a hydraulic study of the river, and carried out an environmental impact study. Ewbank Preece OhEocha, in association with Symonds Travers Morgan, produced a conceptual design and tender documents for Cork Corporation on a design and construct format based on geometric and performance specification. Thirteen parties showed interest in the contract. From these, four consortia were selected and Cork Corporation made a final contract decision in December 1994. As is typical on a large- scale project of this type, the chosen contractor was a joint venture of Tarmac Walls JV, formed by Tarmac Construction, now known as Carillion, and P.J. Walls (Civil) Ltd., part of Ireland's Walls Group. Subcontractors then handled many of the key tasks of construction. Construction Construction involved the excavation of a large casting basin where the tunnel elements or pieces were constructed. After construction of elements was complete, the casting basin was filled with water and joined to the adjacent River Lee, each element was floated out and sunk into position into a carefully dredged river bed. The road surface was laid and the tunnel opened for traffic in 1999. =Construction techniques= The chosen method of construction was the immersed tube technique. In this method, a trench is dredged in the bed of the water channel. Tunnel sections are constructed in the dry, for example in a casting basin, a fabrication yard, on a ship-lift platform or in a factory unit. The ends of the section are then temporarily sealed with bulkheads. Each tunnel section is transported to the tunnel site ‚Äì usually floating, occasionally on a barge, or assisted by cranes. In the Jack Lynch Tunnel, the 610-metre-long reinforced concrete immersed tube tunnel is made up of five elements, each around 122 metres long, 24.5 metres wide and 8.5 metres high. The northern approach was formed by a 120-metre-long floated open 'boat' section ‚Äì the first of its kind. =Excavation and dredging= Dredging International was the chosen dredging contractor, and the value of the dredging contract is stated by them at ‚Ç¨12.4 million. The scope of works consisted of dredging the main tunnel trench and subsequently backfilling the completed construction with sand and gravel. The contract provided also for restoration of the riverbed profile and the addition of a rock protection layer. Between May 1996 and March 1999, the company excavated 785,000 tonnes of silt and alluvium and 300,000 tonnes of sand and gravel. The trench was dredged primarily by a series of specialised vessels, in several stages and with different equipment. Much of the main trench for the Lee Tunnel was excavated by the backhoe dredger \\"Zenne\\". Two barges were used to transport the dredged material 19 km (12 mi) downriver and from there to a disposal site four miles offshore. The cutter dredger \\"Vlaanderen XIX\\" removed the underlying fluvioglacial material. A second cutter dredger, \\"Vlaanderen XV\\", was deployed to breach the casting basin perimeter, or \\"bund\\". A rock layer was encountered on part of the trench line, which was dealt with by the jack- up platform \\"Zeebouwer\\". The \\"Big Boss\\" vessel was employed to remove the rock. This backhoe dredger was equipped with a \\"Backhoover\\" (in effect, a \\"mini\\" precision dredger). This system proved extremely effective in removing very thin layers of recently deposited material immediately prior to immersion of the tunnel elements. =Constructing the immersed tube= Building the tunnel structure required the pre-casting of 5 tunnel segments and an open boat unit. These were constructed in a casting basin located partially on the line of the tunnel south of the river at Mahon. Each segment weighed approx 27,000 tonnes. Contractors Tarmac Walls JV engaged RMD Kwikform, a global construction formwork and shoring solutions company, for the formwork on the tunnel and open section elements of the river crossing. Each box section comprised two 9.8-metre-wide dual lane traffic tubes and a 1.35-metre-wide twin walled central tube for services and emergency access. The 1.2-metre- thick base slab was cast first, followed by the 50-centimetre-thick central walls. The outer walls and roof were cast together in a single operation, in six nominal 20-metre lengths, using special travelling formwork. This was struck inside the formed section, moved along to the next length and then jacked up into position, each within a 72-hour cycle. Each 1000-cubic-metre pour required approximately 1500 square metres of formwork. The inside shutters for the outer walls were vertical steel section panels and Alform Beam walers, which were attached to the top slab of the special steel traveller, while the outer shutters were crane handled vertical steel section panels with Alform Beam or steel channel walers. The open top boat unit, measuring approx 40 metres wide (including two 7.2-metre wings at its widest point), 120 metres long, and up to 10 metres high, was cast in two operations using standard formwork. The boat unit and all the tunnel section elements were cast using grade 40N concrete with a percentage of ggbfs cement replacement, reinforcement being high strength and 16 to 40 mm diameter. Tunnel operation Entrance to the northbound bore The tunnel is currently operated and maintained by Egis Road and Tunnel Operation on behalf of Transport Infrastructure Ireland. Egis took on that role in 2015. Prior to that it had been operated by Cork City Council. The road surface was laid in 1998/1999 and the tunnel opened for traffic on 21 May 1999, roughly 20 years after the first formal studies had been prepared. The final cost of the whole scheme including feeder roads and not just the tunnel itself was IR¬£105 million (approx ‚Ç¨133 million). The tunnel has two separate two-lane bores (each lane 3.75 m wide). There is a service walkway about 1 metre across which doubles as an emergency escape. During periods of maintenance, one tube may be closed and the other used for bi-directional traffic. The environment within the tunnel is controlled by a closed circuit TV system (CCTV), traffic control and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system. External photocells linked to the SCADA system provide a level of tunnel lighting most compatible with ambient light levels outside. To assist drivers in adjusting their eyes, lighting gradually brightens as they approach an exit. Jet fans located within niches in the roof of the immersed tube sections provide longitudinal ventilation, and the tunnel is equipped with fire and life safety equipment. Despite the cost of its construction and operation the tunnel is not tolled. The Feasibility Study for the tunnel envisaged that the crossing could have a toll of 30 pence (in 1981 IR¬£) (approximately ‚Ç¨1.07 in 2020), but the concept of a toll was dropped after political opposition. It was felt that, because of the proximity of the tunnel to the city, the imposition of tolls would tend to encourage some drivers to avoid the tunnel and continue using the city centre streets thus minimising the benefits of the tunnel. An immersed tube tunnel of similar length has been constructed in Limerick,Limerick Tunnel : What is the Limerick Tunnel? as part of Limerick's south ring road. The Limerick Tunnel was constructed under a Public-Private Partnership scheme signed with Direct Route (Limerick) Ltd. and is tolled (and has resulted in some political opposition in Limerick as the Jack Lynch Tunnel is also an inner city relief route but is not tolled).

Different colors of noise have significantly different properties: for example, as audio signals they will sound different to human ears, and as images they will have a visibly different texture. Therefore, each application typically requires noise of a specific color. This sense of 'color' for noise signals is similar to the concept of timbre in music (which is also called \\"tone color\\"); however the latter is almost always used for sound, and may consider very detailed features of the spectrum. The practice of naming kinds of noise after colors started with white noise, a signal whose spectrum has equal power within any equal interval of frequencies. That name was given by analogy with white light, which was (incorrectly) assumed to have such a flat power spectrum over the visible range. Other color names, such as pink, red, and blue were then given to noise with other spectral profiles, often (but not always) in reference to the color of light with similar spectra. Some of those names have standard definitions in certain disciplines, while others are very informal and poorly defined. Many of these definitions assume a signal with components at all frequencies, with a power spectral density per unit of bandwidth proportional to 1/f Œ≤ and hence they are examples of power-law noise. For instance, the spectral density of white noise is flat (Œ≤ = 0), while flicker or pink noise has Œ≤ = 1, and Brownian noise has Œ≤ = 2. thumbrightSimulated power spectral densities as a function of frequency for various colors of noise (violet, blue, white, pink, brown/red). The power spectral densities are arbitrarily normalized such that the value of the spectra are approximately equivalent near 1 kHz. Note the slope of the power spectral density for each spectrum provides the context for the respective electromagnetic/color analogy. Technical definitions Various noise models are employed in analysis, many of which fall under the above categories. AR noise or \\"autoregressive noise\\" is such a model, and generates simple examples of the above noise types, and more. The Federal Standard 1037C Telecommunications Glossary defines white, pink, blue, and black. The color names for these different types of sounds are derived from a loose analogy between the spectrum of frequencies of sound wave present in the sound (as shown in the blue diagrams) and the equivalent spectrum of light wave frequencies. That is, if the sound wave pattern of \\"blue noise\\" were translated into light waves, the resulting light would be blue, and so on. =White noise= White noise spectrum. Flat power spectrum. (logarithmic frequency axis) White noise is a signal (or process), named by analogy to white light, with a flat frequency spectrum when plotted as a linear function of frequency (e.g., in Hz). In other words, the signal has equal power in any band of a given bandwidth (power spectral density) when the bandwidth is measured in Hz. For example, with a white noise audio signal, the range of frequencies between 40 Hz and 60 Hz contains the same amount of sound power as the range between 400 Hz and 420 Hz, since both intervals are 20 Hz wide. Note that spectra are often plotted with a logarithmic frequency axis rather than a linear one, in which case equal physical widths on the printed or displayed plot do not all have the same bandwidth, with the same physical width covering more Hz at higher frequencies than at lower frequencies. In this case a white noise spectrum that is equally sampled in the logarithm of frequency (i.e., equally sampled on the X axis) will slope upwards at higher frequencies rather than being flat. However it is not unusual in practice for spectra to be calculated using linearly-spaced frequency samples but plotted on a logarithmic frequency axis, potentially leading to misunderstandings and confusion if the distinction between equally spaced linear frequency samples and equally spaced logarithmic frequency samples is not kept in mind. R. D. Peters, 2012 =Pink noise= Pink noise spectrum. Power density falls off at 10 dB/decade (‚àí3 dB/octave). The frequency spectrum of pink noise is linear in logarithmic scale; it has equal power in bands that are proportionally wide. This means that pink noise would have equal power in the frequency range from 40 to 60 Hz as in the band from 4000 to 6000 Hz. Since humans hear in such a proportional space, where a doubling of frequency (an octave) is perceived the same regardless of actual frequency (40‚Äì60 Hz is heard as the same interval and distance as 4000‚Äì6000 Hz), every octave contains the same amount of energy and thus pink noise is often used as a reference signal in audio engineering. The spectral power density, compared with white noise, decreases by 3 dB per octave (density proportional to 1/f ). For this reason, pink noise is often called \\"1/f noise\\". Since there are an infinite number of logarithmic bands at both the low frequency (DC) and high frequency ends of the spectrum, any finite energy spectrum must have less energy than pink noise at both ends. Pink noise is the only power-law spectral density that has this property: all steeper power-law spectra are finite if integrated to the high-frequency end, and all flatter power-law spectra are finite if integrated to the DC, low- frequency limit. =Brownian noise= Brown spectrum (‚àí6 dB/octave) Brownian noise, also called Brown noise, is noise with a power density which decreases 6 dB per octave with increasing frequency (frequency density proportional to 1/f over a frequency range excluding zero (DC). Brownian noise can be generated with temporal integration of white noise. \\"Brown\\" noise is not named for a power spectrum that suggests the color brown; rather, the name derives from Brownian motion. Also known as \\"random walk\\" or \\"drunkard's walk\\". \\"Red noise\\" describes the shape of the power spectrum, with pink being between red and white. =Blue noise= Blue spectrum (+3 dB/octave) Blue noise is also called azure noise. Blue noise's power density increases 3 dB per octave with increasing frequency (density proportional to f ) over a finite frequency range. In computer graphics, the term \\"blue noise\\" is sometimes used more loosely as any noise with minimal low frequency components and no concentrated spikes in energy. This can be good noise for dithering.Mitchell, Don P., \\"Generating Antialiased Images at Low Sampling Densities.\\" Computer Graphics, volume 21, number 4, July 1987. Retinal cells are arranged in a blue-noise- like pattern which yields good visual resolution. Cherenkov radiation is a naturally occurring example of almost perfect blue noise, with the power density growing linearly with frequency over spectrum regions where the permeability of index of refraction of the medium are approximately constant. The exact density spectrum is given by the Frank‚ÄìTamm formula. In this case, the finiteness of the frequency range comes from the finiteness of the range over which a material can have a refractive index greater than unity. Cherenkov radiation also appears as a bright blue color, for these reasons. =Violet noise= Violet spectrum (+6 dB/octave) Violet noise is also called purple noise. Violet noise's power density increases 6 dB per octave with increasing frequencyTransactions of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers 1968 Quote: 'A \\"purple noise,\\" accordingly, is a noise the spectrum level of which rises with frequency.'Estimating double difference GPS multipath under kinematicconditions.

They are dominated by high-frequency noise.\\" (density proportional to f 2) over a finite frequency range. It is also known as differentiated white noise, due to its being the result of the differentiation of a white noise signal. Due to the diminished sensitivity of the human ear to high frequency hiss and the ease with which white noise can be electronically differentiated (high pass filtered at first order), many early adaptations of dither to digital audio used violet noise as the dither signal. Acoustic thermal noise of water has a violet spectrum, causing it to dominate hydrophone measurements at high frequencies.Anthropogenic and natural sources of ambient noise in the ocean \\"Predictions of the thermal noise spectrum, derived from classical statistical mechanics, suggest increasing noise with frequency with a positive slope of 6 dB octave‚àí1\\" \\"Note that thermal noise increases at the rate of 20 dB decade‚àí1\\" =Grey noise= Grey spectrum Grey noise is random white noise subjected to a psychoacoustic equal loudness curve (such as an inverted A-weighting curve) over a given range of frequencies, giving the listener the perception that it is equally loud at all frequencies. This is in contrast to standard white noise which has equal strength over a linear scale of frequencies but is not perceived as being equally loud due to biases in the human equal-loudness contour. Informal definitions There are also many colors used without precise definitions (or as synonyms for formally defined colors), sometimes with multiple definitions. =Red noise= * A synonym for Brownian noise, as aboveIndex: Noise (Disciplines of Study [DoS]) * Similar to pink noise, but with different spectral content and different relationships (i.e. 1/f for pink noise, while 1/f2 for red noise). * In areas where terminology is used loosely, \\"red noise\\" may refer to any system where power density decreases with increasing frequency. =Green noise= * The mid-frequency component of white noise, used in halftone dithering * Bounded Brownian noise * Vocal spectrum noise used for testing audio circuits * Joseph S. Wisniewski wrote that \\"green noise\\", as marketed by producers of ambient sound effects recordings, is \\"supposedly the background noise of the world\\". It is noise that simulates the spectra of natural settings, without human-made noises. It is similar to pink noise but it has more energy in the area of 500 Hz. =Black noise= * Silence * Noise with a 1/f spectrum, where . This formula is used to model the frequency of natural disasters. * Noise that has a frequency spectrum of predominantly zero power level over all frequencies except for a few narrow bands or spikes. Note: An example of black noise in a facsimile transmission system is the spectrum that might be obtained when scanning a black area in which there are a few random white spots. Thus, in the time domain, a few random pulses occur while scanning. * Noise with a spectrum corresponding to the blackbody radiation (thermal noise). For temperatures higher than about the peak of the blackbody spectrum is above the upper limit of human hearing range. In those situations, for the purposes of what is heard, black noise is well approximated as violet noise. At the same time, Hawking radiation of black holes may have a peak in hearing range, so the radiation of a typical stellar black hole with a mass equal to 6 solar masses will have a maximum at a frequency of 604.5 Hz - this noise is similar to green noise. A formula is: f_{\\\\text{max}} \\\\approx 3627 \\\\times {\\\\text{M}_\\\\odot \\\\over \\\\text{M}} Hz. Several examples of audio files with this spectrum can be found here. =Noisy white= In telecommunication, the term noisy white has the following meanings: * In facsimile or display systems, such as television, a nonuniformity in the white area of the image, i.e., document or picture, caused by the presence of noise in the received signal. * A signal or signal level that is supposed to represent a white area on the object, but has a noise content sufficient to cause the creation of noticeable black spots on the display surface or record medium. =Noisy black= In telecommunication, the term noisy black has the following meanings: * In facsimile or display systems, such as television, a nonuniformity in the black area of the image, i.e., document or picture, caused by the presence of noise in the received signal. * A signal or signal level that is supposed to represent a black area on the object, but has a noise content sufficient to cause the creation of noticeable non-black spots on the display surface or record medium.

The Public Service Terminal was a three-level streetcar station in Newark, New Jersey, owned and operated by the Public Service Corporation, adjacent to the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad's Park Place station. It served as the terminus for streetcar lines from as far as Trenton. Public Service was both a transportation company and a utility, providing electric and gas service to much of northern New Jersey. The six office stories above the terminal served as company headquarters. The terminal, opened on April 30, 1916 was located at the northeast corner of Park Place and Raymond Boulevard at Military Park, a few blocks away from the busy downtown crossing at Broad and Market Streets. It provided an off-street terminal for streetcars, and a central location for riders. The street entrance was between the two track levels, and provided access to the office floors and to both terminals. Most cars used the upper level, reached by a ramp from Mulberry Street on the east side. Some used the lower level, reached on the west side from Washington Street by a two-block Cedar Street Subway. In 1916 the upper level saw 2,050 cars a day and the lower 550 cars, with more than 50,000 fares paid per day. In 1935 the lower level was connected to the newly built City Subway, which ran under Raymond Boulevard adjacent to the terminal, to allow cars to continue to the subway terminal at Penn Station. The eastbound connection passed under the City Subway to avoid a grade crossing. Like most trolley companies, Public Service converted its routes to bus lines during the 1930s. The last streetcar line using the terminal upper level was the #1-Newark line to Exchange Place Terminal in Jersey City, which ended on August 1, 1937. The last on the lower level was the #43-Jersey City line, running to Exchange Place Terminal by a different route, which ended on May 1, 1938. The terminal continued in use for bus routes. The lower level was used until May 1966, and the upper level until 1978. 80 Park Plaza Public Service sold its transportation system to the New Jersey Transit in 1981, consisting of a large network of bus lines and one trolley line, the City Subway. The terminal building was demolished in June 1981 and replaced with the Public Service Enterprise Group headquarters, 80 Park Plaza. The unused Cedar Street Subway from the portal to a wall east of Broad Street still exists. The City Subway tunnel has become part of the Broad Street branch of the Newark Light Rail, emerging at Centre Street.

The Oakland neighborhood originally formed out of a settlement named \\"Cleaverville\\". In 1851, Charles Cleaver, an industrialist, purchased 22 acres near 38th Street and Lake Michigan. Real-estate developers subdivided the area and renamed it Oakland in 1871. Between 1872 and 1905, Cleaver constructed a soap factory and company town that included a commissary, church, town hall, and homes for the local factory workers. Camp Douglas, located nearby, attracted residents to the area. The adjoining stockyards and commercial district included popular saloons and attracted new citizens. Chicago Tribune - COMMUNITY PROFILE: CHICAGO Oakland: A neighborhood in waiting - November 25, 2011 Over a five- year span, Oakland became home to many of the city's elite. City transportation was greatly improved in the area when the Illinois Central Railroad terminal was constructed at 39th Street and Cottage Grove Avenue in 1881. After the opening of the terminal, 39th and Cottage Grove Avenue became known as the ‚ÄúFive Crossings.‚Äù By the end of the century, The elite residents moved out and were replaced by working-class Irish residents.

Due to this, Racial tensions escalated as the African American population increased due to southern families moving to Chicago. As the tensions flared, White residents resorted to violence and restrictive covenants to prevent African-Americans from moving into the area. Whites efforts to keep African-Americans out were unsuccessful. By 1950, The African-American population was around 77% in Oakland; while other ethnic groups fled the neighborhood.NBC Chicago - Chicago's Most Depopulated Neighborhoods - May 3, 2013 Oakland's population decreased by two- thirds over a 15‚Äìyear period, from 1962 to 1977 which resulted in the neighborhood becoming nearly 100% African‚ÄìAmerican. =Housing= Aldine Square pictured shortly before its demolition, in 1935. One of the six original Lakefront Properties. Named Victor Olander Homes in 1961, it was later renamed Lake Parc Place in 1991. Due to the increase of Irish immigrants in the area, Numerous single-family houses and apartments were constructed to accommodate them. Part of the Oakland area was annexed to Chicago in 1863; the rest in 1889. Between 1939 and 1941, the then‚Äìnewly formed Chicago Housing Authority constructed the Ida B. Wells Homes housing project. Bordered by 37th-39th Streets and Cottage Grove Avenue and Martin Luther King Drive (then South Park Avenue), It was the site of Aldine Square town homes, which by 1935 were old and dilapidated.Chicago Gang History - Oakland, Chicago The housing project increased the African‚ÄìAmerican population in the area and Oakland became a part of the Bronzeville neighborhood. Due to the rapid population growth in the area, The housing authority constructed more public housing. The sites were the Clarence Darrow Homes in 1961, located at the north end of Oakland and Lake Michigan High-Rises, which consisted of six-buildings bordered between 39th and 43rd Streets and Oakenwald and Lake Park Avenues during 1962 and 1963.

The housing projects in the area became crime-infested and controlled by street gangs. Street gangs such as the Disciples, Vice Lords and Black P. Stones were rampant and controlled the area by 1968. The notorious Black P. Stone Nation (later renamed El Rukn) had the largest presence in the area.

Located on the city's South Side, it is from the Loop. It is named for a small park also known as Fuller Park within the neighborhood, which is in turn named for Melville Weston Fuller, a Chicago attorney who was the Chief Justice of the United States between 1888 and 1910. A home to the lower classes throughout its history, it has been beset by many urban problems; its population has declined the most of Chicago's community areas since 1950, and it is considered one of the worst areas in the city. History =19th century= Fuller Park was part of Lake Township until it was annexed by Chicago in 1889. Many Irish Americans, many of whom worked for the railroads or stockyards, lived in Fuller Park after the American Civil War. In 1871, the Lake Shore & Michigan Southern Railroad built a railroad roundhouse in the area. After the Great Chicago Fire in 1871, Chicago adopted stronger building codes and developers built beyond the city limits, including what is now Fuller Park, to evade them. This resulted in an increase in population in the area. In the 1890s, German and Austrian immigrants moved to the neighborhood. =20th century= African Americans began moving into the area at the turn of the century, and along with Mexicans and Slavs had replaced the Irish and Germans by 1920. Migration of African Americans into the area continued in the 20th century, and the neighborhood went from 85 percent white in 1945 to 97 percent black in 1970. As a result of the reformist Settlement movement, which began in the early 1900s and aimed to improve life in poor urban areas, Fuller Park opened in 1912. The park featured a Greek Revival fieldhouse, designed by Daniel H. Burnham and Company. By 1950 a quarter of the neighborhood's residents still lacked indoor toilets. The Dan Ryan Expressway was built in the 1950s, dividing the neighborhood and displacing a third of its residents. The construction of Interstate Highway System also rendered the Union Stock Yards obsolete; they declined in the 1960s and closed in 1971, eliminating many jobs. In the 1980s Fuller Park obtained the fewest bank loans for home improvement in Chicago. Between 1969 and 2004 no new housing was constructed and only 12 permits for commercial development were issued. =21st century= The Fuller Park fieldhouse and associated property was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. The Eden Place Nature Center was established in 2003. Geography Fuller Park is Community Area #37. It is one of Chicago's smallest community areas. It is a strip of land bounded by Pershing Road to the north; Garfield Boulevard to the south; the Dan Ryan Expressway and the Rock Island District commuter rail line of Metra to the east; and the Chicago & Western Indiana Railroad to the west. Fuller Park lies due south of Guaranteed Rate Field (formerly U.S. Cellular Field), where the Chicago White Sox play. The neighborhood is south of the Loop. Demographics , 2,399 people in 1,097 households lived in Fuller Park. The racial composition was 89.12% Black, 3.54% white, 0.50% Asian, and 0.17% other races. Hispanics or Latinos of any race made up 6.63% of the population. The age range was such that 17.1% of the population was 19 and under, 18.1% was aged 20 to 34, 14.1% was aged 35 to 49, 22.8% was aged 50 to 64, and 28% was aged 65 or older. The median age was 50.5. Median household income was $22,920, compared to a citywide median of $55,198. The income distribution was such that 56% of households earned less than $25,000, 23.7% earned between $25,000 and $49,999, 10.7% earned between $50,000 and $74,999, 2.4% earned between $75,000 and $99,999, 7.0% earned between $100,000 and $149,999, and 0.2% earned more than $150,000. This compares with a citywide distribution of 25.4%, 20.5%, 15.6%, 11.0%, 13.2% and 14.3% respectively. Fuller Park is \\"one of the worst neighborhoods in the city by almost every metric.\\"Whet Moser, Homicide, Social Efficacy, and Poverty in Chicago, Chicago Magazine (January 3, 2013). Fuller Park is the Chicago neighborhood which experienced the largest decline in population over the sixty years from the city's peak population in 1950 to 2010; its population declined precipitously from 17,000 in 1950 to under 3,000 in 2010, an 83 percent decline.Whet Moser, Chicago's Most Depopulated Neighborhood Is Also Its Most Troubled, Chicago Magazine (May 6, 2013). In 2013, Fuller Park has the highest \\"hardship score\\" (a combined index of various social and economic statistics) among all Chicago neighborhoods. Fuller Park had the city's highest unemployment rate (40 percent), the second-highest percentage of households below the poverty line (55.5 percent), and the second-lowest per-capita income ($9,016). It was one of only two Chicago community areas with a per-capita income below $10,000.Whet Moser, The Geography of Economic Hardship in Chicago, Chicago Magazine (June 4, 2012). In late 2012, Fuller Park was also the only community area in which more than half the population was food-insecure. Fuller Park also rated the second-lowest in the city in trust in neighbors. According to an analysis of 2012 city data on rates of specific violent crimes (homicide, assault, battery, sexual assault, arson, and burglary), Fuller Park was the most dangerous of Chicago's 77 community areas, with a crime rate of 13,456 per 100,000 people.Whet Moser, What's the Safest Neighborhood in Chicago?, Chicago Magazine, August 27, 2013. Landmarks Fuller Park has the highest concentration of churches per 100,000 residents of any Chicago community area. The community of Fuller Park is also home to Eden Place Nature Center, an environmental education and urban ecology center located on three acres in Fuller Park.Gerry Smith, Eden Place Nature Center serves as model for what urban communities can do with vacant land, Chicago Tribune, April 25, 2011. Eden Place opened in 2003 through the efforts of community activists. The center was built on formerly blighted brownfield land. In 2012, 14,000 people visited Eden Place, about half of them schoolchildren. The center has received many accolades; First Lady Michelle Obama hailed it as a \\"success story,\\" Illinois governor Pat Quinn honored its founder as an \\"environmental hero,\\" and the center was featured in a PBS documentary on community environmental activities in large urban areas. Politics The Fuller Park community area has supported the Democratic Party in the past two presidential elections by overwhelming margins. In the 2016 presidential election, the Fuller Park cast 1,146 votes for Hillary Clinton and cast 24 votes for Donald Trump (96.71% to 2.03%). Despite Clinton's 94.68% margin of victory, it was only her 14th best finish in the City of Chicago. In the 2012 presidential election, Fuller Park cast 1,364 votes for Barack Obama and cast 10 votes for Mitt Romney (99.20% to 0.73%). Despite Obama's 98.47% margin of victory, it was only his 12th best finish in the City of Chicago.

The ancient Athenians celebrated the festival, which commemorated the death of Heracles, on the second day of the month of Metageitnion (which would fall in late July or early August), at the Cynosarges gymnasium at the demos Diomeia outside the walls of Athens, in a sanctuary dedicated to Heracles. His priests were drawn from the list of boys who were not full Athenian citizens (nothoi). Many famous nothoi exercised there (such as Demosthenes) but it was probably not exclusively set aside for them. The Attic cults of Herakles were often closely connected with youth: at several of his cult sites there was a gymnasion attached, and there was a mythological tradition (perhaps originating in Boeotia) that after Heracles died he was translated to Olympus, where he married Hebe, the personification of youth. Because of this Heracles is sometimes worshipped as a god and sometimes as a dead hero. In Thebes, the center of the cult of Heracles, the festivities lasted a number of days, and consisted of various athletic and musical contests (agones), as well as sacrifices. They were celebrated in the gymnasium of Iolaus, the nephew and eromenos of Heracles, and were known as the Iolaeia. The winners were awarded brass tripods.

He was born in Riga, in the Governorate of Livonia of the Russian Empire (present-day Latvia). Though he learned the game of chess relatively late, at age thirteen, Petrovs made rapid progress. By 1926, at age 19, he won the championship of Riga and finished third in the national championship. He placed 2nd‚Äì5th, behind Isakas Vistaneckis, in the first Baltic Championship at Klaipƒóda in 1931. Petrovs won a match with Movsas Feigins (+4 ‚Äì1 =3) in 1931, won a match against Vladas Mikƒónas (+2 ‚Äì0 =1) in 1932, and narrowly lost a match to Rudolf Spielmann (+1 ‚Äì2 =5) in 1934. Petrovs tied for first with Fricis Ap≈°enieks in 1934, and won the Latvian Championship in 1935 and 1937.

This was Petrovs‚Äô finest tournament achievement. Later the same year, he finished last at Semmering. Petrovs placed 3rd-5th at ≈Å√≥d≈∫ in 1938, behind Vasja Pirc and Tartakower, and third at Margate in 1938, behind Alekhine and Rudolf Spielmann, defeating Alekhine in their individual game. In 1939, Petrovs placed 8th of 16 at Kemeri‚ÄìRiga, and won at Rosario, ahead of Erich Eliskases and Mikenas. Petrovs played for Latvia in all seven official Chess Olympiads from 1928 to 1939.

In 1940 the Soviet Union annexed Latvia. Petrovs finished 10th out of 20 in the 1940 USSR Championship, taking equal third at Riga in 1941, and second in several strong tournaments: Moscow in 1941, behind Isaak Mazel; Moscow in 1942, behind Igor Bondarevsky, National Tournament- Moscow 17.02-12.03.1942 and Sverdlovsk in 1942, behind Viacheslav Ragozin. When Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, Petrovs was unable to return to his wife and daughter at home in Latvia. He remained in Russia and was arrested on 31 August 1942 under Article 58 for criticising decreased living standards in Latvia after the Soviet annexation of 1940. Petrovs was sentenced to ten years in a corrective labor camp. In 1947 his death was announced, but only in 1989 it became known that he had died at Kotlas in 1943 from pneumonia. A rapid chess tournament, the Vladimir Petrov Memorial, was held in his memory in J≈´rmala in 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016.

It is, with the SD80MAC, one of the largest single- engined locomotives produced by EMD, surpassed only by the dual-engined DDA40X. The SD90MAC's features include radial steering trucks with AC traction motors and an isolated safety cab which is mounted on shock absorbers to lessen vibrations in the cab. The SD90MAC, like the SD80MAC, SD70ACe, and SD70M-2, has a wide radiator section, nearly the entire width of the locomotive, which along with their size makes them easy to spot. As of 2019, some SD90MACs are still in service on the Union Pacific. Norfolk Southern had rostered 110 SD90MAC locomotives purchased or traded from Union Pacific or the CIT Group respectively, that have now all been rebuilt as EMD SD70ACU locomotives. Canadian Pacific has also opted to convert their small fleet of long-stored SD90MACs into SD70ACUs as well. History Union Pacific SD9043MAC locomotive No. 8027 The SD90MAC was introduced in 1995, along with the SD80MAC locomotives. The SD90MAC was designed to utilize the new 16-cylinder H-engine, while the SD80MAC was designed to use the 20-cylinder version of the existing 710G engine. However, technical problems with the engine resulted in the first locomotives being shipped with 16-cylinder 710G engines, making them similar to the SD70MAC's. These locomotives were given the informal model designation SD9043MAC by railroads that purchased them with the option to re-engine them with engines when they became available. This upgrade program, however, was never taken advantage of by SD90MAC buyers due to reliability issues with the newer engine. Over 400 SD90MAC locomotives fitted with the 710 engine were built. In 1996, Electro-Motive Diesel entered full production on their , 16-cylinder H-engine, and all SD90MACs made from then on used that for its prime mover. Locomotives fitted with this engine are sometimes referred to as SD90MAC-H locomotives. Later versions of the SD90MAC-H feature a Phase II cab, with a new nose which offers higher visibility from the cab than the old nose. The SD90MAC-H did not prove popular with railroads and less than 70 were built, including Electro-Motive Diesel demonstrator units. Since the SD90MAC-H had such a large prime mover, it didn't offer the same operational flexibility as smaller units, limiting its possible customer base to only the largest railroads. Also, since the H-engine was a new design it hadn't reached the same level of reliability as EMD's previous engine. The low reliability on such a large engine was an especially bad combination since the loss of one engine in a train meant the loss of a larger percentage of pulling power than had a smaller engine failed. In the end the SD90MAC-H was only delivered to two railroads, the Union Pacific Railroad and the Canadian Pacific Railway. The Canadian Pacific locomotives were part of an earlier order for 710-engine equipped SD90MAC locomotives that was still in production when Electro-Motive Diesel switched over to the H-engine.

The SD70ACU is part of Norfolk Southern's SD90MAC rebuild program. As of January 2005, the SD90MAC is no longer in production due to the Environmental Protection Agency's Tier 2 locomotive emission regulations, although EMD had planned to be able to get the H-engine approved at some later date. However, China recently announced an order for 300 JT56ACe locomotives, which also use the H-Engine as its prime mover. A portion of the locomotives will be assembled in kit form by China's own Dalian Locomotive Works. These units were reportedly capable of meeting the EPA's strict regulations and began delivery in the latter half of 2007. Due to reliability issues, FMG units 910 to 917 are stored and deemed not be used. They were purchased to be used as \\"slave\\" units, and they were more offline than they were in use. FMG is looking to fit 910-917 to the same specifications as 901-909. 916 is currently in the shops. On 1 August 2008 Union Pacific Railroad announced that it would be retiring 21 of the SD90MAC locomotives. Common parts will be used to maintain the railroad's 710-engined SD90MAC fleet. The 265H prime mover will be cut up or exported. The only part that is non-reusable will be the frame. These units, in the 8900 series will be removed from storage in Denver, and be sent to East St. Louis, Ill., in small batches to be dismantled. As of 2019, Union Pacific still operates some of the remaining SD9043MACs, which sport new numbers and UP wings on the cab. UP 3567, an SD9043MAC still in regular service in 2019 Canadian Pacific's SD90MAC-H locomotives 9300-9303 (listed as SD90MAC6000s) were up for tendered sale in 2009. The bidding ended 31 March 2010. While they were originally thought to be shipped overseas, they were eventually moved to Quebec for scrapping. Canadian Pacific's SD90MAC locomotives, numbered in the 9100-9160 series had been in long term storage in Winnipeg, Manitoba for much of the 2010-decade. With three units, the 9129, 9133 and 9138 being scrapped in November 2012 due to errors in preparing them for long term storage. The entire fleet had been put up for sale in November 2012 and again in January 2013 with no offers being made. These units remained stored until the Winter of 2018 when at first 30, then all 58 remaining units entered a rebuild program to be converted into SD70ACUs. In September 2014, Norfolk Southern purchased 100 4300 hp SD9043MACs from Union Pacific with the intent to rebuild them into SD70ACUs at the Juniata Shops. The last 4 SD90MACs were taken delivery to Norfolk Southern on October 3, 2015 running parallel to Western Ave in Chicago IL. On 26 June 2018 it was announced that CP had contacted Progress Rail (corporate parent to EMD) to rebuild 30 of their SD90MAC fleet into SD70ACUs, much like the Norfolk Southern had previously done with a second-hand SD90MAC fleet. In 2019, an additional 30 units were added to the order for a total of 60 SD70ACU rebuilds, with 28 coming from the remainder of Canadian Pacific's SD90MAC fleet and the other two purchased from Union Pacific's SD90MAC fleet. In 2015 Cummins rebuilt a single SD90MAC with its QSK95 engine, designed to meet Tier 4 emissions standards. Sygnet Rail Technologies and Brookville Equipment Corporation performed the conversion. The rebuild was designated HTL4200AC. The locomotive, numbered CECX 1919, had been Union Pacific 8559.

It is owned and operated by Informa and acted as the online sister publication to the print magazine Game Developer. Sections Gamasutra has five main sections: 1) News: where daily news is posted 2) Features: where developers post game postmortems and critical essays 3) Blogs: where users can post their thoughts and views on various topics 4) Jobs/Resume: where users can apply for open positions at various development studios 5) Contractors: where users can apply for contracted work. The articles can be filtered by either topic (All, Console/PC, Social/Online, Smartphone/Tablet, Independent, Serious) or category (Programming, Art, Audio, Design, Production, Biz/Marketing). There are three additional sections: a Store where books on game design may be purchased, RSS where users may subscribe to RSS feeds of each section of the website, and a section that links to the website's Twitter account. Trade Center Resource While it does post news found on typical video game websites, Gamasutra is known for providing online resources to aspiring and professional game developers on the disciplines of games, including design, audio, public relations, and art. The site encourages professionals to publish blogs in order to share their expertise with other developers. Analysis articles are popular reads as writers spark discussions on game design and the various trends of the industry. The editorial staff also takes part in conducting interviews with developers and hardware designers, such as Dragon Quest creator Yuji Horii, Nintendo 3DS designer Hideiki Anno, and Portal writer Erik Wolpaw. Post- Mortems Project postmortems, articles which developers recount the successful and unsuccessful elements of a specific game's development, are the most celebrated features on the website, as they provide direct insight in all aspects of game design and educate other developers of various risks and important tips. Many postmortems have been published, ranging from independent games such as Okabu and The Path to major studio projects such as ≈åkamiden and BioShock. There are currently over 150 collected post-mortems dating back as far as 1997. There have been unusual post-mortem articles published, including ‚ÄúA Story of GameLayers, Inc.‚Äù that reveals the tumultuous development and eventual cancellation of a Firefox toolbar-based MMORPG, and ‚ÄúWhat Went Wrong? Learning from Past Post-Mortems‚Äù that details the most common mistakes that developers make as admitted in the articles. Guidelines Gamasutra requires users who wish to publish articles on the website to work with the features director Christian Nutt, whether they have fleshed-out drafts, an outline, or a concept. The editorial staff offers help in shaping, polishing, and editing articles before publication. A broad range of topics can be selected given the audience, which consists of businesspeople, educators, and developers, both professional and aspiring. The articles are required to contain at least 1500 words, though the average length tends to be 2500 to 3500 words. Gamasutra also requires a thirty-day exclusivity period from the date of publication, after which the writer is free to take the article elsewhere and retains ownership. Users are also allowed to comment on articles, but there is a strict set of rules. Comment guidelines are designed to keep user discussions of a given article on topic and prevent comments from devolving intoSee [the example sentence for] sense number 5 [\\"To degenerate; to break down\\"] of this version of wikt:devolve#Verb.

It is dedicated to collecting curious links and media for offbeat and often ignored games from consoles old and new, as well as from the digital download, iOS, and indie spaces. GameSetWatch was founded by Simon Carless in November 2005. It has been up and running for 6 years until its semi-permanent hiatus in November 2011. The site has stopped as the creators saw an overlap of content with their sister site IndieGames.com and because they felt the mainstream gaming blogs were covering more of the \\"weirder\\" and alternative video game news. GameSetWatch has remained up for readers but no new content has been posted since. Those that contributed to the launch included current IGF chairman Brandon Boyer, GameTrailers stalwart Michael McWhertor, Gamasutra news director Frank Cifaldi, Alice Taylor, as well as Game Developer mag EIC Brandon Sheffield. The editors at the time Eric Caoili and Danny Cowan have taken different steps to help out at their sister sites. Cowan has gone to blog over at IndieGames.com and Caoili is at Gamasutra. IndieGames.com IndieGames.com started in October 2005. IndieGames.com is Gamasutra's sister site dedicated to reporting on indie games. It became the UBM TechWeb's main method to deliver news about independent games after GameSetWatch closed. In September 2018, IndieGames.com split from its longtime owner UBM. The writers started a new independently ran website called Indie Games Plus, and carried over the older IndieGames.com posts to the new website. =Podcast= The IndieGames.com Podcast was started by Michael Rose and Tim in September 2010. It is available to listen to online or download on the website or iTunes store. An episode is released every week with a guest indie developer hosting the podcast in addition to the two creators of the show. Tim was the independent owner and operator of the Independent Gaming Weblog which was shut down and sold to IndieGames.com in December 2007. Michael Rose is an editor and writer at IndieGames.com. The show has taken a hiatus since July 2012 and has no news of restarting as of yet. =Interviews= The interviews section of the site features interviews with indie game creators and developers. The interviewees answer a set of questions posed by the interviewer including questions regarding their inspirations and hardships. The page is also split into three categories; desktop, console and mobile to organize the interviews by platform interests. =Features= The features section of the site consists of posts by the writers and editors of the site. Articles are written on any topic in the indie game sector. It was announced in September 2014 that there will be collaboration with Games We Care About Twitter page to help gamers discover alt.games recommended by developers and peers. There is also a Best of Features page that highlights some of the more notable freeware and indie games of this and previous years. =Reviews= The Reviews section of the site is written by Michael Rose starting in February 2009. It features reviews on the games mentioned in the ‚ÄúBest of Features‚Äù page to give readers a look into the game before playing it themselves.

It was released for the Apple II, the CoCo, the Commodore 64 the IBM PC and the IBM PCjr. It was followed by a more difficult sequel, Robot Odyssey. It won Software of the Year awards from Learning Magazine (1983), Parent's Choice magazine (1983), and Infoworld magazine (1982, runner-up), and received the Gold Award (for selling 100,000 copies) from the Software Publishers Association. It was one of the first educational software products for personal computers to successfully use an interactive graphical simulation as a learning environment. Gameplay Rocky's Boots directing the player to build a machine that kicks only blue-colored crosses (DOS version.)The object of the beginning part of Rocky's Boots is to use a mechanical boot to kick a series of objects (purple or green squares, diamonds, circles, or crosses) off a conveyor belt; each object will score some number of points, possibly negative. To ensure that the boot only kicks the positive objects, the player must connect a series of logic gates to the boot. The player is represented by an orange square, and picks up devices (the boot, logic gates, clackers, etc.) by moving their square over them and hitting the joystick button. When the boot has kicked all of the positive objects and none of the negative objects (obtaining a score of 24 points), Rocky (a raccoon) will appear and do a beeping dance. Later, the player finds that he can use all of the game's objects, including AND gates, OR gates, NOT gates, and flip-flops, in an open- ended area to design his own logic circuits and \\"games.\\" This is why many do not actually consider this as a game, but more of a visual design engine. The colors of orange and white were used to show the binary logic states of 1 and 0. As the circuits operated, the signals could be seen slowly propagating through the circuits, as if the electricity was liquid orange fire flowing through transparent pipes. Reception II Computing listed Rocky's Boots ninth on the magazine's list of top Apple II education software as of late 1985, based on sales and market-share data. Commodore Microcomputers stated that it \\"is intuitive and easy for kids of all ages to understand\\". The magazine approved of the game's lack of \\"nerve-wracking time limits or invading aliens\\" and encouragement of \\"exploratory learning\\" while teaching \\"nothing less than the fundamentals of digital computer logic from the ground up\\". Computer Gaming World called Rocky's Boots \\"outstanding\\". The review complimented the game's appeal to both children and adults, and its ability to teach Boolean functions in a non-threatening way. InfoWorld commented positively on the game combining play with educational value and conveying circuit design and Boolean logic to children. Similar games The engine for the game was used in several other games by The Learning Company, including the sequel Robot Odyssey, and a still later game called Gertrude's Secrets. The distinctive style of the game was modeled after Robinett's earlier Atari 2600 game Adventure, to which Rocky's Boots was originally going to be a sequel.

Fuller in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Located just west of the Parliament Buildings at Bank and Wellington Streets, it is generally considered part of Parliament Hill. Originally, the land where the Confederation Building and the Supreme Court of Canada now stand contained homes and businesses. These were expropriated by the government to allow for the construction of new federal buildings. Work on the Confederation Building began when the cornerstone was laid by the Governor General Lord Willingdon on July 1, 1927 as part of the celebrations of Canada's Diamond Jubilee and it opened during 1931. It originally housed workers in a number of departments, with the Department of Agriculture being the largest tenant. Today it is home both to civil servants and to a number of MPs and ministers. Many Conservative, Liberal and NDP MPs have their offices there along with some junior cabinet members. As part of the ongoing work on Parliament Hill there are currently discussions to fill the space between the Confederation Building and the smaller Justice Building to create more office space. This has been contested by some, however, due to a government daycare that is open to hill staff that is already there. Work began in 2008 to clean and refurbish the building's masonry.

Dorsey and her influence on other artists. Biography Martin was born in Pittfield, Georgia on November 20, 1895, where she was raised as a Baptist. She joined the Pentecostal movement as a young woman. She began her career singing in Holiness churches after coming to Chicago in 1927. Martin's rough- hewn singing style, combined with the enthusiastic physicality of the Holiness church, nearly kept her from working with Dorsey, who looked down on the shouting style of many Holiness singers and was reluctant to hire a singer who could not read music. Martin nonetheless persuaded Dorsey, after three auditions, to hire her as part of a trio he had formed to introduce his songs to churches. She proved to be an able organizer with a shrewd financial sense who marketed Dorsey's songs, organized his finances, developed new avenues for business and helped launch the National Convention of Gospel Choirs and Choruses, Inc. (NCGCC). Martin was a successful artist in her own right, forming the Sallie Martin Singers, in which her daughter Cora Martin-Moore, Dinah Washington, then known as Ruth Jones, and Brother Joe May were featured, in 1940 after a dispute with Dorsey. She started her own publishing house, Martin and Morris Music, Inc., with Kenneth Morris (8/28/1917-1988), a Gospel music publisher, arranger, composer, and innovator. They were responsible for publishing a number of gospel standards, including Just a Closer Walk With Thee (1940). Martin retired from the Sallie Martin Singers in the mid-1950s as the strain of touring grew too great; the group continued on the road for several more decades. She remained an active force in the NCGCC even after she went out on her own and was a vocal supporter of Martin Luther King Jr. and of health programs in Nigeria. She remained a vigorous proponent of gospel music and defender of her role in bringing it to the churches, as her appearance in the 1982 movie Say Amen, Somebody illustrates vividly. Martin was inducted into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame in 1991. She died on June 18, 1988 in Chicago, Illinois.

Although the word yonkoma comes from Japanese, the style also exists outside Japan in other Asian countries as well as in the English-speaking market (particularly in mid-20th century United States strips, where Peanuts popularized the format; most strips there, including the last several years of Peanuts, have since moved to a three-panel format).

Entitled Jiji Manga, it was thought to have been influenced by the works of Frank Arthur Nankivell and of Frederick Burr Opper.Carolin Fischer,'Mangaka',Unknown date of publication, \\"http://www.mangaka.co.uk/?page=yonkoma\\", 2009-10-29 Structure Traditionally, yonkoma follow a structure known as kish≈çtenketsu. This word is a compound formed from the following Japanese kanji characters: *Ki (): The first panel forms the basis of the story; it sets the scene. *Sh≈ç (): The second panel develops upon the foundation of the story laid down in the first panel. *Ten (): The third panel is the climax, in which an unforeseen development occurs. *Ketsu (): The fourth panel is the conclusion, in which the effects of the third panel are seen. Uses These comic strips appear in almost all types of publications in Japan, including manga magazines, graphic novels, the comics section of newspapers, game magazines, cooking magazines, and so forth. The plot often ends within the four panels; although some serial development may pass on to future installments, creating a more continuous story. Some yonkoma also tackle serious topics, though most do so with humor. Some manga occasionally use yonkoma, usually at the end of a chapter or bound volume, as a non-canon joke to complement the story.

Its boundaries are 43rd Street, 51st Street, Cottage Grove Avenue, and the lake. Kenwood was originally part of Hyde Park Township, which was annexed to the city of Chicago in 1889. Kenwood was once one of Chicago's most affluent neighborhoods, and it still has some of the largest single-family homes in the city. It contains two Chicago Landmark districts, Kenwood and North Kenwood. A large part of the southern half of the community area is in the Hyde Park-Kenwood Historic District. In recent years, Kenwood has received national attention as the home of U.S. President Barack Obama. Description Kenwood was settled in the 1850s by wealthy Chicagoans seeking respite from the increasing congestion of the city. The first of these residents was John A. Kennicott, who built his home near the Illinois Central Railroad at 48th Street. He named the home Kenwood after his ancestral land in Scotland, and when the Illinois Central Railroad built a small depot near 47th Street, they named the station Kenwood as well. Shortly afterwards, the name Kenwood began to be applied to the whole area. The southeastern portion of Kenwood contains the Indian Village neighborhood, which features the Chicago Landmark Powhatan Apartments and the National Register of Historic Places Narragansett. The 1902 Blackstone Library is another well-known landmark in the neighborhood. It continues to be part of the Chicago Public Library system. The recently reopened Hyde Park Art Center, located on Cornell Avenue just north of 51st Street and East Hyde Park Boulevard, is Chicago's oldest alternative exhibition space, with an on-site school and studio. The Hyde Park community area is to the south of Kenwood and the southern half of Kenwood (south of 47th Street) is sometimes referred to as Hyde Park-Kenwood. In the 1890s, the Kenwood Astrophysical Observatory, established by astronomer George Ellery Hale, was located in Kenwood close to the new (at that time) University of Chicago. Politics The Kenwood community area has supported the Democratic Party in the past two presidential elections by overwhelming margins. In the 2016 presidential election, Kenwood cast 7,639 votes for Hillary Clinton and cast 251 votes for Donald Trump (94.19% to 3.09%). In the 2012 presidential election, Kenwood cast 8,712 votes for Barack Obama and cast 331 votes for Mitt Romney (95.63% to 3.63%). Schools The public schools in Kenwood are Kenwood Academy, Canter Middle School, King College Prep High School, Ariel Community Academy, and Beula Shoesmith Elementary School. Private Schools in Kenwood include the Ancona Montessori School, Cambridge School of Chicago, Akiba-Schechter Jewish Day School, and Hales Franciscan High School.

A disused cannon. coats of arms in the English Tower. Ottoman banners hanging in the English Tower. Cross of the Order of St John. Bodrum Castle, 2020 Bodrum Castle () is a historical fortification located in southwest Turkey in the port city of Bodrum (), built from 1402 onwards, by the Knights of St John as the Castle of St. Peter or Petronium. A transnational effort, it has four towers known as the English, French, German, and Italian towers, bearing the names of the nations responsible for their construction. The castle was completed in the late 15th century, only to be taken over by the Islamic Ottoman Empire in 1523. The chapel was converted to a mosque, and a minaret was added. The castle remained under the empire for almost 400 years. After remaining empty following World War I, in the early 1960s, the castle became the home for the award-winning Bodrum Museum of Underwater Archaeology (see below). In 2016 it was inscribed in the Tentative list of World Heritage Sites in Turkey. History Confronted by the now firmly established Ottoman Sultanate, the Knights Hospitaller, whose headquarters were on the island of Rhodes, needed another stronghold on the mainland. Grand Master Philibert de Naillac (1396‚Äì1421) identified a suitable site across from the island of Kos, where a castle had already been built by the Order. Its location was the site of a fortification in Doric times (1110 BC) as well as of a small Seljuk castle in the 11th century. The same promontory is also the probable site of the Palace of Mausolos, the famous King of Caria.Turner, J. - Grove Dictionary of Art - Oxford University Press, USA; New Ed edition (January 2, 1996); In his travel diary Travels In Asia Minor, Charles Boileau Elliot describes this palace as the Palace of Mausolus with absolute certainty, and this account was written in the year 1840. The construction of the castle began in 1404Bodream, Jean- Pierre Thiollet, Anagramme Ed., 2010, p. 13. under the supervision of the German knight architect Heinrich Schlegelholt. Construction workers were guaranteed a reservation in heaven by a Papal Decree of 1409.Bodream, Jean- Pierre Thiollet, Anagramme Ed., 2010, p. 90. They used squared green volcanic stone, marble columns and reliefs from the nearby Mausoleum of Maussollos to fortify the castle. The first walls were completed in 1437. The chapel was among the first completed inner structures (probably 1406). It consists of a vaulted nave and an apse. The chapel was reconstructed in Gothic style by Spanish Knights of Malta in 1519‚Äì1520. Their names can be found on two cornerstones of the fa√ßade. Fourteen cisterns for collecting rainwater were excavated in the rocks under the castle. This was a monumental achievement of the day and the family who completed the excavation were given the honorific of \\"Burrows\\" for their exceptional digging skills. Each langue of the Order had its own tower, each in its own style. Each tongue, each headed by a Bailiff, was responsible for the maintenance and defense of a specific portion of the fortress and for manning it with sufficient numbers of knights and soldiers. There were seven gates leading to the inner part of the fortress. The architect applied the latest features in castle design; the passages leading to the gates were full of twists and turns. Eventual assailants could not find cover against the arrows, stones or heated projectiles they had to confront. The knights had placed above the gates and on the walls hundreds of painted coats of arms and carved reliefs. Two hundred and forty-nine separate designs still remain, including those of grand masters, castle commandants, countries, and personal coat of arms of knights and religious figures. The construction of the three-storied English tower was finished in 1413. One door opens to the north, to the inner part of the castle, while the other leads to the western rampart. One could only access this tower via a drawbridge. The western fa√ßade shows an antique carved relief of a lion. Because of this relief, the tower was also called \\"the Lion Tower\\". Above this lion, one can see the coat of arms of King Henry IV of England. For over a century St. Peter's Castle remained the second most important castle of the Order. It served as a refuge for all Christians in Asia Minor. The castle came under attack with the rise of the Ottoman Empire, first after the fall of Constantinople in 1453 and again in 1480 by Sultan Mehmed II. The attacks were repelled by the Knights of St John. In 1482, Prince Cem Sultan, son of Sultan Mehmed II and brother of Sultan Bayezid II, sought refuge in the castle, after a failure in raising a revolt against his brother. When the Knights decided to fortify the castle in 1494, they used stones from the Mausoleum once again. The walls facing the mainland were thickened in order to withstand the increasing destructive power of cannon. The walls facing the sea were less thick, since the Order had little to fear from a sea attack due to their powerful naval fleet. Grand Master Fabrizio del Carretto (1513‚Äì21) built a round bastion to strengthen the land side of the fortress. Sir Thomas Docwra was appointed Captain of the Castle in 1499. Despite their extensive fortifications, the Crusaders's towers were no match for the forces of S√ºleyman the Magnificent, who overpowered the knights in 1523. Under the Ottoman rule, the castle's importance waned, and in 1895 it was converted into a prison. =16th century= Between 1505 and 1507 the few sculptures from the mausoleum that had not been smashed and burnt for lime were integrated into the castle for decoration. These included twelve slabs of the Amazonomachy (combat between Amazons and Greeks) and a single block of the Centauromachy, a few standing lions, and one running leopard. When faced with an attack from Sultan Suleiman, Philippe Villiers de L'Isle-Adam, the Grand Master of the Knights Hospitallers, ordered the Castle to be strengthened again. Much of the remaining portions of the mausoleum were broken up and used as building material to fortify the castle. By 1522 almost every block of the mausoleum had been removed. In June 1522 the sultan attacked the Order's headquarters in Rhodes from the Bay of Marmaris with 200,000 soldiers (Siege of Rhodes (1522)). The castle of Rhodes fell in December 1522. The terms of surrender included the handing over of the Knights' fortresses in Kos and St Peter's Castle in Bodrum. After the surrender, the chapel was converted into a mosque and a minaret was added. This mosque was called the S√ºleymaniye Camii, as attested by a traveler, Evliya Chelebi, who visited Bodrum in 1671. The minaret was destroyed on 26 May 1915 by rounds fired by a French warship during World War I. It was reconstructed in its original shape in 1997. =19th century= In 1846 Lord Canning, HM Ambassador to Constantinople, obtained permission to remove twelve marble reliefs showing a combat between Greeks and Amazons from the castle. Sir Charles Newton, a member of the staff of the British Museum, conducted excavations and removed a number of stone lions and one leopard in 1856. These are all still to be found today at the British Museum. In later years, the castle has been used for different purposes. It was used as a military base by the Turkish Army during the Greek Revolt in 1824. In the 19th century, the chapel which had been converted for use as a mosque had a minaret added. At the same time, a hamam (public bath) was installed in the castle. In 1895 the castle was turned into a prison. During World War I, the castle was fired upon by a French warship, toppling the minaret and damaging several towers. After the Great War, the Italians established a garrison in the castle but withdrew in 1921 when Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk came to power, when the castle stood empty for 40 years. Museum of Underwater Archaeology In 1962 the Turkish Government decided to turn the castle into a museum for the underwater discoveries of ancient shipwrecks in the Aegean Sea. This has become the Bodrum Museum of Underwater Archaeology, with a collection of amphoras, ancient glass, bronze, clay, and iron items. It is the biggest museum of its kind devoted to underwater archaeology. Most of its collection dates from underwater excavations carried out by the Institute of Nautical Archaeology (INA) after 1960. These excavations were performed on several shipwrecks: *Finike-Gelidonya shipwreck (12th century BC): 1958‚Äì1959; first underwater excavation in Turkey *Bodrum-Yassiada shipwreck (Byzantine, 7th century AD): 1961‚Äì1964; Roman merchant vessel with 900 amphoras *Bodrum -Yassiada shipwreck (Late Roman, 4th century AD) *Bodrum-Yassiada shipwreck (Ottoman, 16th century AD) (dated by a 16th-century four-real silver coin from Seville (Philip II) ) *·π¢eytan Deresi shipwreck (16th century BC) *Marmaris- Ser√ße harbour shipwreck (glass, 11th century AD): 1977; collection of Islamic glassware *Marmaris-Ser√ße harbour shipwreck (Hellenistic, 3rd BC) *Ka·π£- Uluburun shipwreck (14th century BC): 1982‚Äì1995; 10 tons of Cypriot copper ingots; one ton of pure tin ingots; 150 glass ingots; manufactured goods; Mycenaean pottery; Egyptian seals (with a seal of queen Nefertiti) and jewelry *Tekta·π£ Burnu Classical Greek shipwreck (5th century BC): 1999-2001 The former chapel houses an exhibition of vases and amphoras form the Mycenaean age (14th to 12th centuries BC) and findings from the Bronze Age (around 2500 BC). The commercial amphoras give a historical overview of the development of amphoras and their varied uses. The Italian Tower houses a collection spanning many centuries in the Coin and Jewelry Hall. Another exhibition room is devoted exclusively to the tomb of a Carian princess, who died between 360 and 325 BC. The collection of ancient glass objects is one of the four largest ancient glass collections in the world. Finally, two ancient shipwrecks have been reconstructed: the Fatƒ±mi ship, sunk in 1077 AD, and the large Uluburun Shipwreck from the 14th century BC. A garden inside the castle is a collection of almost every plant and tree of the Mediterranean region, including both the myrtle, and the plane tree. Turquoise and amber peacocks parade under flowering trees and bushes. From the towers it is possible to see the entire city as well as some of the neighboring bays.https://premiumtravel.net/turkey- cities/bodrum/ File:Turkey.Bodrum054.jpgModel of the Yassiada vessel (Byzantine, 7th century) File:Turkey.Bodrum095.jpgEgyptian jewelry (Uluburun shipwreck) File:Turkey.Bodrum033.jpgCollection of amphoras from different parts of the Mediterranean File:Bodrum Museum Carian Princess 3656.jpgBodrum Museum Carian Princess 3656 File:Bodrum Museum Carian Princess 3664.jpgBodrum Museum Carian Princess 3664 File:Bodrum Museum Carian Princess 3661.jpgBodrum Museum Carian Princess 3661 File:Bodrum Museum Carian Princess 3659.jpgBodrum Museum Carian Princess 3659 File:Bodrum Museum Carian Princess 3665.jpgBodrum Museum Carian Princess 3665 See also *Bodrum *Halicarnassus *Uluburun Shipwreck *Order of Malta Notes External links *Underwater Archeology Museum (Ministry of Culture and Tourism website) * Bodrum museum virtual tour (pop-up on Ministry of Culture and Tourism website) *Bodrum Castle information, photos and map of Bodrum Castle Bodrum Castles in Turkey Castles and fortifications of the Knights Hospitaller Archaeological museums in Turkey Maritime museums in Turkey Museums established in 1962 Landmarks in Turkey Museums in Muƒüla Province World Heritage Tentative List for Turkey ","title":"Bodrum Castle"},{"id":"1367046","text":"; is a Japanese steel manufacturer.

Early philosophy  A century after the Qur'an was revealed, numerous religious schisms arose in Islam. Skeptics sought to investigate the doctrines of the Qur'an, which until then had been accepted as divine revelation. The first independent protest was that of the Qadar (\\"Destiny\\"), whose partisans affirmed the freedom of the will, in contrast with the Jabarites (jabar, force, constraint), who maintained the traditional belief in fatalism. In the second century of the Hegira, a schism arose in the theological schools of Basra, over which Hasan al-Basri presided. A pupil, Wasil ibn Ata, who was expelled from the school because his answers were contrary to tradition, proclaimed himself leader of a new school, and systematized all the radical opinions of preceding sects, particularly those of the Kadarites. This new school or sect was called Mutazilites (from 'tazala, to separate oneself, to dissent). The sect had three principal dogmas: (1) God is an absolute unity, and no attribute can be ascribed to Him. (2) Man is a free agent. Because of these two principles the Mutazilites designate themselves the \\"As·∏¶ab al-'Adl w'al Tau·∏¶id\\" (The Partisans of Justice and Unity). (3) All knowledge necessary for the salvation of man emanates from his reason; he could acquire knowledge before as well as after Revelation, by the sole light of reason--a fact which, therefore, makes knowledge obligatory upon all men and women, at all times, and in all places. The Mutazilites, compelled to defend their principles against the orthodox Islamic faith, looked for support to the doctrines of philosophy, and thus founded a rational theology, which they designated \\" 'Ilm-al-Kalam\\" (Science of the Word); and those professing it were called Motekallamin. This appellation, originally designating the Mutazilites, soon became the common name for all seeking philosophical demonstration in confirmation of religious principles. The first Motekallamin had to combat both the orthodox and the infidel parties, between whom they occupied the middle ground; but the efforts of subsequent generations were entirely concentrated against the philosophers. The later Motekallamin formed a school known as Ash'arism, which regarded itself as the champion of orthodoxy, and references by the later philosophers to \\"Motekallamin\\" (theologians) should usually be taken as meaning the Ash'arites. From the ninth century onward, owing to Caliph al-Ma'mun and his successor, Greek philosophy was introduced among the Arabs, and the Peripatetic school began to find able representatives among them; such were Al-Kindi, Al-Farabi, Ibn Sina, and Ibn Roshd, all of whose fundamental principles were considered as heresies by the Motekallamin.  Argument for creation  Aristotle, the prince of the philosophers, demonstrated the unity of God; but from the view which he maintained, that matter was eternal, it followed that God could not be the Creator of the world. Again, to assert, as the Peripatetics did, that God's knowledge extends only to the general laws of the universe, and not to individual and accidental things, is tantamount to giving denial to prophecy. One other point shocked the faith of the Motekallamin--the theory of the intellect. The Peripatetics taught that the human soul was only an aptitude--a faculty capable of attaining every variety of passive perfection--and that through information and virtue it became qualified for union with the active intellect, which latter emanates from God. To admit this theory would be to deny the immortality of the soul (see Alexander of Aphrodisias). Wherefore the Motekallamin had, before anything else, to establish a system of philosophy to demonstrate the creation of matter, and they adopted to that end the theory of atoms as enunciated by Democritus. They taught that atoms possess neither quantity nor extension. Originally atoms were created by God, and are created now as occasion seems to require. Bodies come into existence or die, through the aggregation or the sunderance of these atoms. But this theory did not remove the objections of philosophy to a creation of matter. For, indeed, if it be supposed that God commenced His work at a certain definite time by His \\"will,\\" and for a certain definite object, it must be admitted that He was imperfect before accomplishing His will, or before attaining His object. In order to obviate this difficulty, the Motekallamin extended their theory of the atoms to Time, and claimed that just as Space is constituted of atoms and vacuum, Time, likewise, is constituted of small indivisible moments. The creation of the world once established, it was an easy matter for them to demonstrate the existence of a Creator, and that He is unique, omnipotent, and omniscient. Toward the middle of the eighth century a dissenting sect--still in existence to-day--called Karaites, arose in Judaism. In order to give a philosophical tinge to their polemics with their opponents, they borrowed the dialectic forms of the Motekallamin, and even adopted their name (Mas'udi, in \\"Notices et Extraits des Manuscrits de la Biblioth√®que Royale,\\" viii. 349-351), and thus transplanted the Kalam gradually to Jewish soil, to undergo the same transformations there as among the Arabs.  Saadia Gaon  One of the most important early Jewish philosophers influenced by Islamic philosophy is Saadia Gaon (892-942). His most important work is Emunoth ve-Deoth (Book of Beliefs and Opinions). In this work Saadia treats of the questions that interested the Motekallamin so deeply--such as the creation of matter, the unity of God, the divine attributes, the soul, etc. -- and he criticizes the philosophers severely. For Saadia creation is not problematic: God created the world ex nihilo, just as Scripture attests; and he contests the theory of the Motekallamin in reference to atoms, which theory, he declares, is just as contrary to reason and religion as the theory of the philosophers professing the eternity of matter. To prove the unity of God, Saadia uses the demonstrations of the Motekallamin. Only the attributes of essence (sifat-al- datiat) can be ascribed to God, but not the attributes of action (sifat-al- af'aliyat). The soul is a substance more delicate even than that of the celestial spheres. Here Saadia contradicts the Motekallamin, who considered the soul an \\"accident\\" (compare \\"Moreh,\\" i. 74), and employs the following one of their premises to justify his position: \\"Only a substance can be the substratum of an accident\\" (that is, of a non-essential property of things). Saadia argues: \\"If the soul be an accident only, it can itself have no such accidents as wisdom, joy, love,\\" etc. Saadia was thus in every way a supporter of the Kalam; and if at times he deviated from its doctrines, it was owing to his religious views; just as the Jewish and Muslim Peripatetics stopped short in their respective Aristotelianism whenever there was danger of wounding orthodox religion.  Neoplatonic philosophy  Jewish philosophy entered upon a new period in the eleventh century. The works of the Peripatetics --Al- Farabi and Ibn Sina (Avicenna)--on the one side, and the \\"Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity\\"--a transformed Kalam founded on Neoplatonic theories--on the other side, exercised considerable influence upon Jewish thinkers of that age. The two leading philosophers of the period are Ibn Gabirol (Avicebron) and Bahya ibn Pakuda -- the former standing upon a purely philosophical platform, the latter upon a religio-philosophical one; and both attaining similar results. Both believe in a universal matter as the substratum of all (except God) that exists; but Bahya goes further and determines what that matter is: it is Darkness (\\"Ma'ani al-Nafs,\\" translated by Broyd√©, p. 17). But this matter did not exist from all eternity, as the Peripatetics claimed. It is easy to perceive here the growth of the Peripatetic ideas as to substance and form; but influenced by religion, these ideas are so shaped as to admit the non-eternity of matter. In all that pertains to the soul and its action, Gabirol and Bahya are undoubtedly influenced by the \\"Brethren of Purity.\\" Man (the microcosm) is in every way like the celestial spheres (the macrocosm). Just as the heavenly spheres receive their motion from the universal soul-- which is a simple substance emanating from God--so man receives his motion from the rational soul--another simple substance emanating from Him. In fact, creation came through emanation, and in the following sequence: (1) The active intellect; (2) the universal soul--which moves the heavenly sphere; (3) nature; (4) darkness--which at the beginning was but a capacity to receive form; (5) the celestial spheres; (6) the heavenly bodies; (7) fire; (8) air; (9) water; (10) earth (\\"Ma'ani al-Nafs,\\" 72; compare Munk, l.c., p. 201). But as regards the question of the attributes which occupy the Jewish and Muslim theologians so much, Bahya, in his work on ethics, \\"Hovot ha-Levavot,\\" written in Arabic under the title of \\"Kitab al-Hidayat fi faraidh al Kulub\\" (The Duties of the Heart), is of the same opinion as the Motazilites, that the attributes by which one attempts to describe God should be taken in a negative sense, as excluding the opposite attributes. With reference to Gabirol, a positive opinion can not be given on this point, as his \\"Fons Vit√¶\\" does not deal with the question; but there is reason to believe that he felt the influence of the Asharites, who admitted attributes. In fact, in his poetical philosophy, entitled \\"Keter Malkut\\" (The Crown of Royalty), Gabirol uses numerous attributes in describing God. By way of a general statement, one may say that the Neoplatonic philosophy among the Jews of the eleventh century marks a transitional epoch, leading either to the pure philosophy of the Peripatetics or to the mysticism of the Kabbalah.  The apotheosis of philosophy  The twelfth century saw the apotheosis of pure philosophy and the decline of the Kalam, which latter, being attacked by both the philosophers and the orthodox, perished for lack of champions. This supreme exaltation of philosophy was due, in great measure, to Gazzali (1005-1111) among the Arabs, and to Judah ha-Levi (1140) among the Jews. In fact, the attacks directed against the philosophers by Gazzali in his work, \\"Tu·∏¶fat al- Falasafa\\" (The Destruction of the Philosophers), not only produced, by reaction, a current favorable to philosophy, but induced the philosophers themselves to profit by his criticism, they thereafter making their theories clearer and their logic closer. The influence of this reaction brought forth the two greatest philosophers that the Arabic Peripatetic school ever produced, namely, Ibn Baja (Aven Pace) and Ibn Roshd (Averroes), both of whom undertook the defense of philosophy. Gazzali found an imitator in the person of Judah ha-Levi. This illustrious poet took upon himself to free religion from the shackles of speculative philosophy, and to this end wrote the \\"Cuzari,\\" in which he sought to discredit all schools of philosophy alike. He passes severe censure upon the Motekallamin for seeking to support religion by philosophy. He says, \\"I consider him to have attained the highest degree of perfection who is convinced of religious truths without having scrutinized them and reasoned over them\\" (\\"Cuzari,\\" v.). Then he reduced the chief propositions of the Motekallamin, to prove the unity of God, to ten in number, describing them at length, and concluding in these terms: \\"Does the Kalam give us more information concerning God and His attributes than the prophet did?\\" (Ib. iii. and iv.) Aristotelianism finds no favor in his eyes, for it is no less given to details and criticism; Neoplatonism alone suited him somewhat, owing to its appeal to his poetic temperament. But the Hebrew Gazzali was no more successful than his Arabian prototype; and his attacks, although they certainly helped to discredit the Kalam--for which no one cared any longer-- were altogether powerless against Peripatetic philosophy, which soon found numerous defenders. In fact, soon after the \\"Cuzari\\" made its appearance, Abraham ibn Daud published his \\"Emunah Ramah\\" (The Sublime Faith), wherein he recapitulated the teachings of the Peripatetics, Al-Farabi and Ibn Sina, upon the physics and metaphysics of Aristotle, and sought to demonstrate that these theories were in perfect harmony with the doctrines of Judaism. \\"It is an error generally current,\\" says Ibn Daud in the preface of his book, \\"that the study of speculative philosophy is dangerous to religion. True philosophy not only does not harm religion, it confirms and strengthens it.\\" = Maimonides = The authority of Ibn Daud, however, did not suffice to give permanence to Aristotelianism in Judaism. This accomplishment was reserved for Maimonides, who discussed the relevance of the philosophy of Aristotle to Judaism; and to this end he composed his immortal work, \\"Dalalat al-·∏§airin\\" (Guide for the Perplexed) --known better under its Hebrew title \\"Moreh Nevuchim\\"--which served for many centuries as the subject of discussion and comment by Jewish thinkers. In this work, Maimonides, after refuting the propositions of the Motekallamin, considers Creation, the Unity of God, the Attributes of God, the Soul, etc., and treats them in accordance with the theories of Aristotle to the extent in which these latter do not conflict with religion. For example, while accepting the teachings of Aristotle upon matter and form, he pronounces against the eternity of matter. Nor does he accept Aristotle's theory that God can have a knowledge of universals only, and not of particulars. If He had no knowledge of particulars, He would be subject to constant change. Maimonides argues: \\"God perceives future events before they happen, and this perception never fails Him. Therefore there are no new ideas to present themselves to Him. He knows that such and such an individual does not yet exist, but that he will be born at such a time, exist for such a period, and then return into non-existence. When then this individual comes into being, God does not learn any new fact; nothing has happened that He knew not of, for He knew this individual, such as he is now, before his birth\\" (\\"Moreh,\\" i. 20). While seeking thus to avoid the troublesome consequences certain Aristotelian theories would entail upon religion, Maimonides could not altogether escape those involved in Aristotle's idea of the unity of souls; and herein he laid himself open to the attacks of the orthodox. = Averroism = Ibn Roshd (or Ibn Rushd or Averroes), the contemporary of Maimonides, closes the philosophical era of the Arabs. The boldness of this great commentator of Aristotle aroused the full fury of the orthodox, who, in their zeal, attacked all philosophers indiscriminately, and had all philosophical writings committed to the flames. The theories of Ibn Roshd do not differ fundamentally from those of Ibn Bajjah and Ibn Tufail, who only follow the teachings of Ibn Sina and Al-Farabi. Like all Arabic Peripatetics, Ibn Roshd admits the hypothesis of the intelligence of the spheres and the hypothesis of universal emanation, through which motion is communicated from place to place to all parts of the universe as far as the supreme world--hypotheses which, in the mind of the Arabic philosophers, did away with the dualism involved in Aristotle's doctrine of pure energy and eternal matter. But while Al-Farabi, Ibn Sina, and other Arab philosophers hurried, so to speak, over subjects that trenched on religious dogmas, Ibn Roshd delighted in dwelling upon them with full particularity and stress. Thus he says, \\"Not only is matter eternal, but form is potentially inherent in matter; otherwise, it were a creation ex nihilo (Munk, \\"M√©langes,\\" p. 444). According to this theory, therefore, the existence of this world is not only a possibility, as Ibn Sina declared--in order to make concessions to the orthodox--but also a necessity. Driven from the Arabian schools, Arabic philosophy found a refuge with the Jews, to whom belongs the honor of having transmitted it to the Christian world. A series of eminent men--such as the Tibbons, Narboni, Gersonides--joined in translating the Arabic philosophical works into Hebrew and commenting upon them. The works of Ibn Roshd especially became the subject of their study, due in great measure to Maimonides, who, in a letter addressed to his pupil Joseph ben Judah, spoke in the highest terms of Ibn Roshd's commentary.  Influence of Andalusi mystical theosophy Vahid Brown states that the cross-fertilization among Jewish and Islamic philosophical mysticism, including Kabbalah and Sufism, in Al-Andalus, Spain during its Golden Age, apart from its impact on European Renaissance, had a strong influence in later developments in both philosophies in the rest of the Jewish and Muslim world.Brown, Vahid (2006).

Featuring a cast of seven Irish comedians and impressionists, the show, which aired for half an hour weekly, satirised many aspects of Irish life. Bull Island was created by RT√â Producer/Director John Keogh who brought Michael Sheridan, Alan Shortt & Gary Flood together to devise & co-create the format. Some of the notable women in power at the time, such as the then Cabinet Minister, Mary O'Rourke, and the Taoiseach Bertie Ahern's partner Celia Larkin were played by a man, and there were regular depictions of deception and skulduggery in the D√°il bar. The opposition were usually portrayed as bumbling incompetents. Other sketches included a regular pastiche of Paddy O'Gorman and his shows which consist of interviewing people at random - Bull Island's Paddy O'Gormless would do similar, but with ever more inane interviews. A favourite sketch, which became known as the show's signature, was an impersonation of a long- running ad for Irish discount electrical retailer PowerCity, where actors looking surprisingly like those in the adverts, wearing the same bright red jumpers, would wax enthusiastic about prices ending in 99 pence in \\"Bull Island City\\". This evolved into a stream of products costing \\"99.99.99\\" as the series progressed. As a result, PowerCity removed the pence from all their prices, and regularly charge round tens or hundreds for products instead of 99s. Although the show was met with good reviews and ratings in its first season, the reception to later seasons was mixed and the show ended in 2001, shortly before the 2002 general election. The same team appeared providing a 30-minute radio version of the programme on RT√â radio within weeks. Some of the actors behind some impressions include: * Alan Shortt - Bertie Ahern, Michael D.

Hawkins spent most of his Major League Baseball (MLB) career with the San Diego Padres, and also played for the New York Yankees and briefly for the Oakland Athletics. Baseball career = San Diego Padres = He is known for being the first (and thus far, the only) San Diego Padres pitcher to win a World Series game. Hawkins earned a victory pitching in relief in Game 2 of the 1984 World Series, which the Padres lost to Detroit in five games, though he was the losing pitcher in the fifth and final game. His best season was 1985, when he threw a career- high 228 innings, compiled an 18‚Äì8 record (winning his first 11 starts), and finished with a 3.15 ERA. Hawkins is the first pitcher to win his first ten starts since the advent of divisional play in Major League Baseball which started in 1969. His 18 no decisions in 1986 were the most among MLB starting pitchers for that season. = New York Yankees = After six seasons in San Diego, Hawkins became a free agent after the 1988 season and signed a three- year contract with the New York Yankees in December 1988. Hawkins was the Yankees' most consistent starter in 1989, compiling a 15‚Äì15 record, a 4.80 ERA and an American League-leading 111 earned runs surrendered in 208 innings pitched. But in the following year, Hawkins struggled for a very poor Yankees team. On May 8, with just one win and an ERA of 8.56, Hawkins was offered his outright release, which he accepted, although an injury that night to pitcher Mike Witt changed his mind. Hawkins pitched much better in his next three starts, although he still had only a 1‚Äì4 record three months into the season. On July 1, 1990, Hawkins started against the Chicago White Sox at Comiskey Park. He dominated the White Sox into the eighth inning, retiring the first two batters before Sammy Sosa reached on a fielding error by Yankees third baseman Mike Blowers. After Hawkins loaded the bases by walking the next two batters, Robin Ventura lofted a fly ball to left field. Rookie Jim Leyritz, fighting a blustery wind, had the ball glance off his glove for an error, allowing all three baserunners to score. The next batter, Ivan Calder√≥n, hit a high fly ball to right field, which Jesse Barfield lost in the sun, dropping it for another error, allowing Ventura to score. The Yankees could not score in the ninth, giving Hawkins the loss despite not allowing a hit. Major League Baseball does not consider this effort an official no-hitter, listing Hawkins as having only completed eight innings pitched.http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/history/rare_feats/index.jsp?feature=no_hitter_loss On September 4, 1991, the Committee for Statistical Accuracy, appointed by commissioner Fay Vincent, changed the definition of a no-hitter to require that a pitcher must throw at least nine full innings and a complete game for the no-hitter to be official. Since Hawkins played for the visiting team, the White Sox never batted in the ninth inning, meaning Hawkins lost credit for a no-hitter. The game was also notable for being a double no-hitter into the sixth inning (and a double perfect game into the fifth), as White Sox starter Greg Hibbard also pitched very well. In his next appearance on July 6, he faced the Minnesota Twins at Yankee Stadium in the opening game of a doubleheader. Hawkins pitched a shutout into the twelfth inning but wound up losing 2‚Äì0. Since then, no other starting pitcher has pitched in an MLB game into the twelfth inning or later. In his following appearance on July 12 in the Bronx, the Yankees lost a six-inning no-hitter to M√©lido P√©rez and the White Sox. Likewise, that game is not considered an official no-hitter, as the game was shortened to seven innings due to rain; Hawkins was still on the mound when the game was delayed, and then called off. Hawkins's worst month of his career was capped off with his worst start of the season, at home on July 17 against the Kansas City Royals. Hawkins labored through 4 innings and surrendered eight runs on the strength of four homeruns, including three by Bo Jackson, and took the loss in a 10-7 Kansas City victory. Hawkins finished 1990 with a 5‚Äì12 record and a 5.37 ERA in 157 innings pitched. Hawkins started off the 1991 season poorly as well, appearing in four games and going 0‚Äì2 before being taken out of the rotation, giving up 14 earned runs in 12 innings. The Yankees released Hawkins on May 9, two days after he lasted only 2 innings and surrendered four earned runs and five hits (including two homeruns) to the California Angels on May 7 in Anaheim. He signed with the Oakland Athletics more than a week later; he compiled a 4‚Äì4 record with a 4.79 ERA in 77 innings before the Athletics released him in mid-August. In what would be his final major league appearance on August 4 against the Twins in Oakland Hawkins faced only one batter, striking out Scott Leius swinging. In his three seasons in the American League, Hawkins also struggled mightily while pitching in Fenway Park. In three career starts there against the Boston Red Sox, Hawkins managed a total of just one inning, giving up 18 earned runs. =Coaching= Hawkins was the bullpen coach of the Texas Rangers, having served as the interim pitching coach following the firing of previous pitching coach Mark Connor during the 2008 season. Before being promoted as the interim coach, Hawkins was the pitching coach for the Oklahoma RedHawks. At the end of the 2015 season Hawkins left the Rangers. In 2016 Hawkins was hired on as the pitching coach for the Kansas City Royals AAA team, the Omaha Storm Chasers.

Subband went on to reacquire the MacAMP name, and released an MP3 player, again named MacAMP. While at Subband, Lagutin originated the idea for a MacAMP plugin that would capture audio from other applications. Audio Hijack was born as a plugin for MacAMP for Mac OS 9.

The Numbers. Retrieved May 22, 2012. }} Thunderbolt and Lightfoot is a 1974 American crime comedy film written and directed by Michael Cimino and starring Clint Eastwood, Jeff Bridges, George Kennedy, and Geoffrey Lewis. Plot A young ne'er-do-well, Lightfoot (Jeff Bridges) steals a car. Elsewhere, an assassin attempts to shoot a preacher delivering a sermon at his pulpit. The preacher escapes on foot. Lightfoot, who happens to be driving by, inadvertently rescues the preacher by running over his pursuer and giving the preacher a lift. Lightfoot eventually learns that the \\"minister\\" is really a notorious bank robber known as \\"The Thunderbolt\\" (Clint Eastwood) for his use of an Oerlikon 20 mm cannon to break into a safe. Hiding out in the guise of a clergyman following the robbery of a Montana bank, Thunderbolt is the only member of his old gang who knows where the loot is hidden. After escaping another attempt on his life by two other men, Thunderbolt tells Lightfoot that the ones trying to kill him are members of his gang who mistakenly thought Thunderbolt had double-crossed them. He and Lightfoot journey to Warsaw, Montana to retrieve the money hidden in an old one-room schoolhouse. They discover the schoolhouse has been replaced by a brand-new school standing in its place. Thunderbolt and Lightfoot are abducted by the men who were pursuing them‚Äîthe vicious Red Leary (George Kennedy) and the gentle Eddie Goody (Geoffrey Lewis)‚Äîand driven to a remote location where Thunderbolt and Red fight each other, after which Thunderbolt explains how he never betrayed the gang. Lightfoot proposes another heist‚Äîrobbing the same company as before‚Äîwith a variation on the original plan; the variation being due to Lightfoot inadvertently killing their electronics expert, Dunlop, the man who tried to assassinate Thunderbolt in the earlier scene. In the city where the bank is located, the men find jobs to raise money for needed equipment while they plan the heist. The robbery begins as Thunderbolt and Red gain access to the building. Lightfoot, dressed as a woman, distracts the Western Union office's security guard, deactivates the ensuing alarm, and is picked up by Goody. Using an anti-tank cannon to breach the vault's wall, as they did in the first heist, the gang escapes with the loot. They flee in the car, with Red and Goody in the trunk, to a nearby drive-in movie in progress. Upon seeing a shirt tail protruding from the car's trunk lid (which is a strong indication one or more people are hiding in the trunk to avoid paying), the suspicious theater manager goes to investigate. Red becomes increasingly agitated and Thunderbolt leaves the drive-in, encountering police at the exit. Thunderbolt tries to evade the police, and a chase ensues. Goody is shot and Red throws him out of the trunk onto a dirt road, where he dies. Red then forces Thunderbolt and Lightfoot to stop the car. He pistol-whips them both, knocking them unconscious, and violently kicks Lightfoot in the head multiple times. Red takes off with the loot in the getaway car but is again pursued by police, who shoot Red several times, causing him to lose control of the car and crash through the window of a department store, where he is attacked and killed by the store's vicious watchdog. Escaping on foot, Thunderbolt and Lightfoot hitch a ride the next morning and are dropped off near Warsaw, Montana, where they stumble upon the one-room schoolhouse‚Äînow a historical monument on the side of a highway‚Äîmoved there from its original location in Warsaw after the first heist. As the two men retrieve the stolen money, Lightfoot's behavior becomes erratic as a result of the beating. Thunderbolt buys a new Cadillac convertible with cash, something Lightfoot said he had always wanted to do, and picks up his waiting partner, who is gradually losing control of the left side of his body. As they drive away celebrating their success with cigars, Lightfoot, in obvious distress, tells Thunderbolt in a slurred voice how proud he is of their 'accomplishments', and slumps over dead. Thunderbolt snaps his cigar in half (as it is no longer a celebration), and with his dead partner beside him, he drives off down the highway into the distance. Cast Production =Development and screenplay= Stan Kamen of the William Morris Agency came up with the initial idea for Thunderbolt and Lightfoot,McGilligan, p. 237 but gave it to Michael Cimino to write on speculation with Eastwood in mind.

The film was shot in 47 days from July to September 1973.Bach, p. 141 It was filmed in Fort Benton, Wolf Creek, Great Falls, and Hobson. St. John's Lutheran Church in Hobson was used for the opening scene. The freeway exit for fictional Warsaw was, in reality, the Interstate 15 exit for Dearborn, an unincorporated community that straddles the Cascade/Lewis & Clark County Line. The scene where Thunderbolt recovers the money from the one-room schoolhouse was filmed at the rest stop just south of Exit 240, which is the exit for Dearborn.Dearborn, Cascade County MT Google Maps (accessed September 4th, 2019) Eastwood did not like to do any more than three takes on any given shot, according to co-star Bridges. \\"I would always go to Mike and say 'I think I can do one more.

Given that for Eastwood this was an offbeat film, Frank Wells of Warner Bros. refused to back Malpaso in the production, leaving him to turn to United Artists and producer Bob Daley.McGilligan (1999), p. 239 Eastwood was unhappy with the way that United Artists had produced the film and the scheduled two-film deal between Malpaso and UA was cancelled.McGilligan, p. 241 Thunderbolt and Lightfoot was released to DVD by MGM Home Video on June 13, 2000 as a Region 1 widescreen DVD and also by Twilight Time on February 11, 2014 as a Region A Blu-ray.

Eastwood's acting performance was noted by critics to the extent that Clint himself believed it was Oscar worthy.McGilligan (1999), p. 240 Analysis Author Michael Bliss wrote that while Thunderbolt may appear to be a conventional violent action film with Eastwood in the lead role, the film is more like \\"a meditation on, than a representation of, the male camaraderie theme\\" using rhetorical devices such as symbol, camerawork, and allusive dialogue to add to that theme.Bliss, p. 151 According to Bliss, the film's structural paradigm describes a tripartite series of events: natural order followed by disturbance followed by a restoration of natural order.Bliss, p. 153 See also * List of American films of 1974 References =Footnotes= =Bibliography= * Bach, Steven (September 1, 1999).

Noteworthy releases have included Mount Eerie pts. 6 & 7 (a hardcover coffee-table book of Elverum's photography, packaged with a 10\\" record), Lost Wisdom (recorded with Julie Doiron and Frederick Squire), and Wind's Poem (a black metal-influenced double-album, recorded with Nicholas Krgovich). In 2012, Elverum released two albums, Clear Moon and Ocean Roar. He was also chosen to perform at Jeff Mangum's All Tomorrow's Parties festival in Minehead, England. An admirer of Netural Milk Hotel, he stated it was an \\"honor to be chosen.\\" In 2013, Elverum was a part of the Primavera Sound line up. A new Mount Eerie double-album entitled Sauna was released on February 2, 2015. =2017‚Äì2020: A Crow Looked At Me, Now Only and Lost Wisdom Pt.2= In January 2017, the song \\"Real Death\\" was released from the forthcoming album A Crow Looked at Me. A second single, \\"Ravens\\", was released on February 15. On March 24, A Crow Looked at Me was released to high critical praise. Exclaim!'s Alex Hudson scored the album a 9 out of 10, calling the record an \\"emotionally nuanced meditation on death that is both heartbreaking and hopeful.\\" January 2018, the album Now Only was announced along with the release of the album track \\"Distortion\\". A press release indicated that the album was written in 2017 shortly following the death of Genevi√®ve Castr√©e, Phil's wife. The album was officially released March 16, 2018 to positive reviews, with The Atlantic describing the album as a progression from A Crow Looked At Me: \\"not an experience of total sadness, featuring flashes of irony, hope, and love\\". After touring North America in the summer of 2017, Elverum played songs from A Crow Looked At Me across Europe and Australasia. The second of these shows became (after), a live recording eventually released in September 2018 and was well received by Pitchfork who noted \\"the most striking thing about (after) is that, even after so many performances, these songs sound as raw as they did when Elverum first committed them to paper and tape\\". On September 25, 2019, Elverum announced a sequel to his 2008 collaboration with Julie Doiron, Lost Wisdom, entitled Lost Wisdom pt. 2. it was released on November 8, 2019. Two singles were released. On January 28, 2020 Elverum announced a North American tour in support of the album. That same week as the announcement Elverum toured through Canada with singer Angel Olsen. The tour was set to take place in April of that year with Julie Doiron accompanying him however was cancelled and rescheduled to October 2020 due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Elverum also announced a show with Angel Olsen at Brooklyn's Prospect Park Bandshell on July 22. In 2020 Elverum appeared on a charity compilation album entitled: \\"The Song Is Coming From Inside the House\\". All proceeds from the album will go to Groundswell's Rapid Response Fund, a charity intended to help \\"provides fast funding to grassroots organizations led by women of color, trans people of color, and low-income women and trans people in critical\\". Elverum was also featured on the 20th anniversary reissue Mirah's debut album, You Think It‚Äôs Like This But Really It‚Äôs Like This; performing an \\"Of Pressure\\" cover.  Artistry  Elverum's music under the Mount Eerie moniker expresses a close relationship to nature and the pacific northwest, in particular the minute details. In a 2014 interview, Elverum discussed how his choice for moniker coming from a mountain in Anacortes, was a way of enfusing a sense of regional connection between the music and the place. My Bloody Valentine, George Gurdjieff and black metal have all been cited by Elverum as influences to the project. His lyrical matter has been seen by some to be more introspective than his work before the name change. Brady Baker of Spectrum Culture called Mount Eerie \\"a solid foundation for an ever-expanding lyrical labyrinth that centers on his introspective philosophy.\\" Eric Hill of Exclaim! believed the opposite, writing that Elverum's work under the Mount Eerie title is more \\"universal and, at times, hermetic.\\" Elverum also believed that the songs under Mount Eerie were more universal describing them as \\"this one long chain, about the idea of singing from the point of view of this dark looming mountain shape, while Microphones songs, historically, have been more personally narrative, maybe more human.\\" Musically, Elverum has experimented with \\"black metal, lo- fi krautrock, fuzzy post-rock textures and Auto-Tune experimentation\\".  Reception  Kerrang! included Mount Eerie on their list 10 non metal artists enjoyed by metal fans.

It was formed to shore up financing and development of New Jersey's streetcar and power companies at a time when they were growing but exhausting capital. It did this by leasing their operations or buying them outright, and using the size and integration of the systems to get favorable financing for improvements. Its energy utility became the Public Service Electric and Gas Company. Its transportation business became the nucleus of New Jersey Transit's bus network, along with the Newark subway system.  History  = Formation = In the 1890s, gas lighting was a mature business with small technological advancing growth, but new competition from electricity. Streetcar companies were also well established, but the disjointed network limited the operators, reduced profits, and made it difficult to finance improvements. Some were losing money. Similarly, the electrification of the state had proceeded rapidly, but in a disjointed, local fashion, that sometimes caused financing difficulties for the operators. especially as technological improvements required constant capital. In the 1880s and 1890s, United Gas Improvement of Pennsylvania had developed a model of operating or owning local gas providers. It decided to expand the model to New Jersey, and made a deal in 1899 with several power utilities there to merge into a holding company it formed, United Electric Company of New Jersey. UGI's consolidation strategy served as prototype for large consolidation efforts, which would cover broad portions of New Jersey utility operations, as well as streetcar operation (whose own power generation needs or operations were a natural fit for the electric company consolidation, aside from the pressing need to improve the financial stability of streetcar companies). PSC was formed May 6, 1903. It was initially a merger of four trolley companies and a power company serving Passaic, Hudson, Bergen and Essex counties. It quickly continued consolidating gas, electric and trolley companies throughout much of New Jersey, eventually over 400 being combined. Initially, PSC did not necessarily buy its consolidation target companies (whether transportation or power) outright. Instead, it often obtained very long term lease agreements (typically 900 years) with them for their plants, and often bought large stakes in the companies and took over their boards of directors. By 1928, this arrangement was deemed to be cumbersome and complicated for financing efforts. PSC would use its influence via shared boards of directors to merge the other utilities outright into one of its holding companies, exchanging third parties' shares for PSC preferred stock. = Organization = In its early years, the company had five primary operating subsidiaries: * Public Service Railway Company for streetcars and the Newark subway * Public Service Gas Company * Public Service Electric Company * Public Service Transportation Company, for passenger buses, formed a bit later than the others (started 1917) * United Electric Company of New Jersey (merged 1907) All of these were holding companies, except for the bus company. United Electric was a special case. As mentioned above, it had predated Public Service, having been formed in 1899 to consolidate local electric companies in Essex, Hudson, Passaic, Bergen, Morris, Union, and Middlesex counties (some accounts leave out some of the counties). PSC leased United's operations in 1907, but did not consolidate it into Public Service Electric Company, keeping it as a direct subsidiary of Public Service By 1928, the five were merged into two: * Public Service Electric & Gas Company (including United Electric), 1924 * Public Service Coordinated Transport, merging the streetcar and bus subsidiaries, later renamed Transport of New Jersey (TNJ) = Operations = Within a few years of formation of PSE, with the consolidation of dozens of component companies, rates were significantly reduced for utilities across most service areas, and trolley transportation became less expensive per trip, especially with free transfers across PSE's nine purchased lines. The transportation division originally operated only streetcars. The electric transmission network powering the streetcars was a natural fit for the energy operations when the company was formed. In 1917, Public Service began adding bus routes. The streetcar division was called Public Service Railway Company (Public Service Railways), while the bus division was called Public Service Transportation Company. The two divisions were merged in 1928 to create Public Service Coordinated Transport. In 1935, Public Service began experimenting with All Service Vehicles, trolleys that were adaptable to both rail and road use, using electric service or gas engines. This began the demise of streetcars, with buses taking over their routes. By 1948, Public Service had stopped using the All Service Vehicles in favor of standard buses. In 1948, Public Service Corporation dissolved. PSE&G; went from being a subsidiary to an independent public company. This helped resolve federal and state antitrust concerns. In 1971, Public Service Coordinated Transport was renamed to Transport of New Jersey (TNJ). In the late 1970s, the state began to assess gaps in its commuter network, partly as many large rail companies had failed and been taken over by Conrail. The department of transportation formed a new company, New Jersey Transit, in 1979. It began to buy up bus companies, and purchased Transport of New Jersey in 1980. This ended PSE&G;'s role as a transportation provider, and it became exclusively an energy utility. In 1985, a new holding company, Public Service Enterprise Group, Inc. formed. The new holding company absorbed PSE&G; and formed a second, non-utility subsidiary not subject to utility regulations, Enterprise Diversified Holdings, Inc.

It was based on the 1891 American short story of the same name by American Civil War soldier, wit, and writer Ambrose Bierce. It was directed by Robert Enrico and produced by Marcel Ichac and Paul de Roubaix with music by Henri Lano√´. It won awards at the Cannes Film Festival and the Academy Awards. It was also screened on American television as episode 142 (season 5, episode 22) of The Twilight Zone on 28 February 1964. Plot A handbill posted on a burnt tree, dated 1862, announces that anyone interfering with bridges, railroads or tunnels will be summarily executed. Union troops prepare a civilian prisoner, Peyton Farquhar, for death by hanging from a rural railroad bridge. The soundtrack contains only bird noises and brief military orders. As the rope is adjusted about Farquhar's neck, a vision of his home, wife and children flashes before him. As Farquhar falls, the rope breaks, and he drops into the river. In an underwater sequence he frees himself from his bonds, kicks his boots free and swims downstream as soldiers fire at him. Farquhar is swept through rapids and crawls ashore exhausted but laughing with relief. Glimpses of tree branches, sky and crawling insects are interrupted by a distant cannon shot which sends him running through a forest, then along a linear and orderly lane. Finally arriving at the gates of his home, he pushes his way through foliage. Farquhar reaches open lawn and runs toward his wife as she walks toward him, smiling and weeping. Just as the couple are about to fall into each other's arms, Farquhar stiffens and his head snaps back. The scene cuts back to his body hanging from the bridge, his entire escape and reunion with his wife revealed to be an illusion experienced in the moment of the drop. Twilight Zone airing Two years after its production, the film was screened on American TV as part of the fantasy/science fiction show The Twilight Zone. Producer William Froug had seen the film and decided to buy the rights to broadcast it on American television. The transaction cost The Twilight Zone $25,000, significantly less than the average of $65,000 they expended on producing their own episodes; however, Froug's purchase allowed for the film to be aired only twice (the first airing was on February 28, 1964). Consequently, it is not included on The Twilight Zone's syndication package, though it is included with the series on streaming services and on home video releases. The episode's introduction is notable for Rod Serling breaking the fourth wall even more than usual, as he explains how the film was shot overseas and later picked up to air as part of The Twilight Zone. The introduction by Rod Serling is as follows: Serling's closing narration states: Marc Scott Zicree's The Twilight Zone Companion incorrectly states the French film was purchased for $10,000. This mistake has been reprinted in a number of books since the 1984 publication. The Twilight Zone: Unlocking the Door to a Television Classic by Martin Grams correctly verifies the purchase price as $20,000 plus $5,000 additional costs for re-editing. According to Zicree, \\"An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge\\" was the last episode of the classic Twilight Zone to be \\"produced\\" (presumably referencing the re-editing and the addition of footage of Rod Serling, as production of the series was cancelled afterwards). It was not, however, the last episode of the series to be broadcast.

Biography Born in Bessemer, Alabama, United States, he first appeared on stage at the age of four, then joined a children's gospel group at the age of 13, soon obtaining his own radio show. He organized another group after his mother sent him to New York City following a racial incident; he continued singing after returning to attend the Snow Hill Institute in Snow Hill, Alabama, where he acquired the title \\"Professor\\" while teaching as a student. He moved to Chicago in 1947, where he worked briefly with Roberta Martin and toured with Mahalia Jackson, then struck out on his own with his own group, the Bradford Singers, followed by another group, the Bradford Specials. He recorded his first hit record, \\"Too Close To Heaven\\" (1954), billed as Professor Alex Bradford and his singers, sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc, then followed it with a number of other successes in the rest of the decade. Artists such as Little Richard imitated Bradford's energetic style, ranging from a gravelly bass to a whooping falsetto, and his flamboyant stage presence. Ray Charles, for his part, not only borrowed some of Bradford's vocal mannerisms but based his Raelets on the Bradford Specials. His 1962 gospel song composition \\"Let the Lord Be Seen in Me\\", recorded for his One Step & Angel on Vacation album, was also recorded in 1964 by an emerging force in Jamaican music, Bob Marley & the Spiritual Sisters. Marley later adopted the Rastafarian faith, but along with his mother, at first he sang gospel in the local Shilo Apostolic Church. In 1961, when his recording career was in decline, Bradford joined the cast of the off-Broadway show Black Nativity, based on the writings of Langston Hughes, which toured Europe in 1962.Robert M Marovich, A City Called Heaven: Chicago and the Birth of Gospel Music, University of Illinois Press, 2015, p. 249. A member of the Alex Bradford Singers at that time was Madeline Bell, who settled in England after the show ended. Bradford appeared in Don't Bother Me, I Can't Cope, for which he won the Obie award in 1972. Death Alex Bradford died in Newark, New Jersey in 1978 after a stroke, as the musical Your Arms Too Short to Box with God was in production. He was 51 years old.

While currently listed as Least Concern by the IUCN, the general consensus is that the population is decreasing.  Taxonomy  Acanthiza nana was named by Irish zoologist N. A. Vigors and American naturalist Dr Thomas Horsfield in 1827, with the bird noted in the Sydney Cove area. However, the earliest field notes with type description record the yellow thornbill in 1803, with records sent at the time to the Linnaean Society of London. The generic name Acanthiza derives from Ancient Greek akanthe≈çn 'thorn-brake' and za≈ç 'live, inhabit'.The specific epithet nana is Latin for a 'female dwarf'. The yellow thornbill is one of 13 currently recognised species of thornbill within the genus Acanthiza. There are five species groups recognised within this genus, with the yellow thornbill (Acanthiza nana) most closely related to the striated thornbill (Acanthiza lineata). The only Acanthiza species which occurs outside Australia, the New Guinea thornbill (Acanthiza murina), also bears close molecular similarities to both the yellow and striated thornbills. Description Adult yellow thornbill (Acanthiza nana). Although similar to the striated thornbill and brown thornbill in both size and shape, the yellow colour of the yellow thornbill is more prominent. There is no sexual dimorphism, so that males and females look alike. They are around in length, with an average wing span of , and weighing between . =Adults= The back feathers are greenish, the primary and secondary wing coverts are olive-brown with a paler edge on the primaries that contrast with the alula. Upper- and under-tail are more dull than the rest of the body, and the same colour as the wings except for a dark brown-black subterminal band. Their throat and chin is a pale buff-orange that blends into the soft, creamy-yellow of the breast. Legs, toes, and bill are all black. Their eyes are dark brown with a grey outer-ring, although in some individuals the outer ring of the iris is almost white or pale brown. The eye-ring is narrow and cream in colour. The lores are also cream, with a slight grey tone. Belly is yellow, fading to a pale olive on the flanks. The head and ear coverts are olive-grey, with white streaking over the eyes and ear coverts. =Juveniles= Juveniles appear similar to adults, though feathers are \\"softer\\" looking and duller by comparison . When recently fledged, their gape is still yellow. The yellow feathers on their belly are more subdued, and back and head feathers are more brown than olive.  Behaviour  Yellow thornbill (Acanthiza nana) feeding young in the nest. = Breeding = The yellow thornbill likely breed in solitary pairs, but in some areas, evidence of co-operative breeding has been found. Yellow thornbill nests are rounded and domed, with a small entrance near the top. Nests are usually made of bark-fibre and grasses matted together with spider-web, located in the upper foliage of shrubs and small trees. Clutches of two to four eggs are laid soon after the nest has been completed, and are incubated for 16‚Äì17 days. = Vocalisation = The yellow thornbill has a loud, two-note tzid-id call, notably different from calls of the closely related striated thornbill by its harsher, less insect-like sound. The call is repeated at various intervals throughout the day and is associated with contact between birds while foraging, as defence, or as a territorial advertisement. = Feeding and Diet = Occasionally, yellow thornbills have been observed in feeding flocks of up to 35 individuals, as well as mixed-species feeding flocks. More commonly, however, they are found in smaller groups or pairs. They prefer the upper and middle levels of forest canopy, and can be found moving rapidly through the outer foliage searching for food, or looking under bark. Their diet consists mostly of insects, but they will sometimes eat seeds. They will also catch insects mid-flight.  Habitat and Distribution  Yellow thornbills are found mainly within temperate and semi-arid areas, with their range just extending into the subtropical zone. Within these zones, yellow thornbills are found in a variety of habitats including shrublands, forests and thickets, preferring vegetation dominated by casuarinas or eucalypts, particularly in areas with a drier climate. Their range extends from northern and central west Queensland, south along the eastern coast of Australia through much of New South Wales, throughout Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory, and into the southeastern corner of South Australia.  Conservation  Their current status according to the IUCN Red List is Least Concern, but with a decreasing population. In developed areas such as towns or industrial sectors, the yellow thornbill has only been recorded in older development areas and not at all in more recently developed areas. This correlates with observations of general bird populations in residential zones, with native birds decreasing when the native vegetation is removed. Fire also affects population numbers, with only the oldest age-class present after fires. In farmland which undergoes regular harvesting, yellow thornbills have not been recorded. Fire, land development, agricultural insecticides and climate change have also led to a decrease in insect populations, which for a largely-insectivorous bird could potentially hold severe complications in the future.

She asks a friend, Dr. Martin Fischer (Thomsen), a revolutionary reproductive researcher, to assist her in creating her clone so that she can pass her music onto her daughter. Even though cloning of humans is illegal, Dr. Fischer agrees so that he will forever be known as the first. The procedure is a success and Iris gives birth to Siri (Potente). Siri closely resembles her mother in both facial features and musical talent. When Siri finds out at the age of thirteen that she is her mother's clone, her whole world falls apart. The once very close and sweet relationship between mother and daughter turns into an emotional struggle. They fight for the same man, compete with their musical careers, and nearly pay with their lives. In order to escape the disappointment of her own existence, Siri later moves to Canada where she starts a lonely life away from civilization in the woods photographing deer.

It was the capital of the Remi tribe and the second largest city in Roman Gaul. Before the Roman conquest of northern Gaul, the city was founded circa 80 BC, served as the capital of the tribe of the Remi. In the course of Julius Caesar's conquest of Gaul (58‚Äì51 BC), the Remi allied themselves with the Romans, and, by their fidelity throughout the various Gallic insurrections, secured the special favour of imperial power. At its height in Roman times the city had a population in the range of 30,000 ‚Äì 50,000 or perhaps up to 100,000, and was an important node in the road system of Gallia Belgica. After the installation of Magnus Maximus in Augusta Treverorum, Durocortorum was renamed Metropolis Civitas Remorum, and no longer served as the capital of Gallia Belgica although it remained the capital of Belgica Secunda.  Etymology and historical mentions  The Latin Durocort≈çrum comes from the Celtic \\"Durocorteron\\" (\\"round fortress\\"). It was an oppidum of the tribe of the Remi founded circa 80 BC, and served as its capital. Mentions of Durocortorum from sources during Antiquity in chronological order are: *By Ptolemy in his Geography, II, 9, 6 Duricortora (). *By Julius Caesar in his Gallic wars, VI, 44, and to 3. *By Strabo in his Geographica, IV, 3, 5. *By Ammianus Marcellinus in his Res gestaehttp://www.tertullian.org/fathers/index.htm#Ammianus_Marcellinus XV, 11-10. *In the proceedings of the Synod of Arles (314) in codex C 37 civitas Remorum, K 27, A 24, D 24 (Item de Galleis. Inbetausius episcopus, Primigenius diaconus de ciuitate Remorum [Reims]). *By Saint Jerome, in his letter CXXIII, 15 to Gerchia, Remorum urbs. *In the Codex Theodosianus, Valens and Valentinian II are in Durocortorum in 366 and 367 promulgating imperial ordinances (book VIII, 7 given at Durocortorum on 7 April 366 ; book XI, 1 given at Durocortorum 19 May 366 ; ...book XIV, 4 given at Durocortorum 8 June 367). *In the Notitia dignitatum, the city is mentioned for its sword manufacturing (Western empire IX, 36) for its manufacturing of court wear (Western empire XI, 56), its workshops for gold or silver jewellery (Western empire XI, 76), as the residence of the main tax collector (????? French: Directeur des caisses g√©n√©rales de comte des Largesses) (Western empire XI, 34), and the prefect of the laeti and heathens ( Western empire XLII, 42). = Durocortorum, oppidum of the Remi = Before the foundation of Durocorteron, the main settlement of the Remi was an oppidum located near the current villages of Variscourt and Cond√©-sur-Suippe close to Reims,. Founded between 450 and 200 BC during the La T√®ne I and II period, it already covered some 500 Hectares, and was most likely surrounded by two concentric walls or ditches. As shown by archeological finds in the necropolises found at the site, it was then succeeded by the oppidum of Durocortoron (latinised to Durocortorum) at the location of the city Reims. Since the Gauls had a culture of orally transmitting information, little information exists on Durocortorum before the arrival of the Romans. However, it was widely considered to be the northernmost civilised city. Archeological excavations show it was sparsely inhabited since the La T√®ne period. The town of 90 Hectares was centred around the current \\"place Royal\\" in Reims and protected by fortifications, consisting of an of 50 metres length, 8 metre deep ditch and an earth wall, probably capped with a wooden palissade. The perimeter, grid and Augustean Necropolis. = The Remi and Rome = The territory of the Remi during Battle of the Axona in 57 BC At the time of Caesar's invasion of Gaul, the territory of the Remi stretched from the Seine to the Marne and the Meuse in north eastern Gaul, on the southern border of Gallia Belgica. On seeing the advance of the armies of Julius Caesar, the Belgae united to push back the invasion. The Remi, however, stayed out of this coalition and decided to ally themselves with the Romans. They sent two representatives with offerings to negotiate, and tried in vain to convince the Suessiones, a kin tribe with whom they shared laws and government, to follow them. In 57 BC the Belgae attacked the oppidum Bibrax at the battle of the Axona. However, Caesar's legions were victorious and successfully defended the oppidum. After Caesar's retreat, the armies of the Belgae attacked the Remi, but the Roman troops made a U-turn and came back to help their allies. The Remi remained loyal allies of Rome during all of the Gallic wars. Durocortorum was therefore declared an allied city and allowed to be independent with the privilege of keeping its laws, religion, and government, and the Suessiones were put under their dominion. In 53 BC, Caesar ordered a concilium Galliae to unite at Durocortorum in order to judge Acco, chief of the Carnutes, for the conspiracy between the Senones and the Carnutes. Under Augustus, its territory was integrated in the province Gallia Belgica of which Durocortorum became the capital. = The Gallo-Roman city = The city on the Peutinger map. Borders of the Roman Empire in 70 AD with tribes and major roads The city had an area of about 500 to 600 Hectares. Having the same centre as the earlier Gaulic oppidum, it possessed a regular street plan with 15 metre wide streets flanked by a gutter. The street plan had two major axes which can still be found in present day Reims: the cardo major (rue de Vesle, avenue Jean Jaures), and the decumanus major (rue de l'Universit√©, rue Anatole-France and rue Colbert), which crossed in the centre (place Royale). The Gaulic city likely occupied a little natural height that dominated the swamp where the Vesle streamed in the opposite direction of its general course, but the height is now probably about 6 metres below street level. For its period, the Gallo-Roman city was huge: it was the capital of Gallia Belgica and one of the largest cities north-west of Rome. It was delineated by four monumental gates of which the porte de Mars, dedicated to the god of war, was oriented towards Gallia Belgica that was in the process of pacification. Of the other ones, only some remains of the gate of Dionysus (porte de Baz√©e) have survived. Veritable triumph arcs were erected on the diagonals connecting the gates to glorify the invader-colonisers. From de gate of Ceres roads divided towards Augusta Treverorum (Trier), Divodorum (Metz) and Colonia Agrippina (Cologne). Next to, and just outside the gate of Ceres was the craftsmen quarter that was mainly specialised in working bone. From the gate of Mars roads went towards Bavacum (Bavay), Tervanna (Th√©rouanne) and the port of Gesoriacum (Boulonge sur mer). From the gate of Venus a single road, due to having to cross the swamp, directed towards Lutetia (Paris). From the gate of Dionysus, roads split towards Rome and Tullum Leucorum (Toul). Cemeteries lined the roads entering and leaving the city. Other roads of the Gallo Roman city were, as typical for Roman cities, parallel and orthogonal to the cardo- and decumanos majores. At the end of the 2nd century, the city was developing rapidly, benefitting from the progressively ensuing Pax Romana which resulted in increased commerce. It was in this period that the above mentioned gates were constructed as well as the enormous covered area of the cryptoportique, a U shaped 100 by 50metre long heightened area that made out the northern part of the Forum, and which became the commercial centre of the city. A market was probably held close (perhaps at the current rue du Marc). The city also had an amphitheatre, a stadium (rue Gosset), an arena (Rue du Mont-d'Ar√®ne), thermae, temples and rich villas as witnessed by the mosaics that were found. The city also had its own supply of fresh water from an aqueduct () to the Suippe, a sewage system and a waste dump. Christianity had become established in the city by 260, at which period Saint Sixtus founded the bishopric of Reims.

Metropolis Civitas Remorum (Reims) during the late Roman Empire. The consul Flavius Jovinus, an influential supporter of Christianity, repelled the Alamanni who invaded Champagne in 336. In 357 and 366 invasions of Germanic tribes are pushed back before they reach Metropolis Civitas Remorum (Reims) as Durocortorum is called during this period. The city did not have defensive fortifications yet, and the progressively declining Roman Empire did not have sufficient military forces to protect it. At the time the city extended beyond the large Gallo Roman ditch, but the population declined and found refuge within the perimeter delimited by four Roman gates. The enclosure can still be found in the street plan formed by the rue de Talleyrand, rue de Chanzy, rue de Contrai, and the rue des Murs, named after walls that were built during that period, rue Ponsardin, rue Rogier, rue Andrieuz, and the boulevard D√©saubeau. On a small hill outside of the city, what is now the \\"quartier St. Remi\\", a small borough developed. The defences would not prove sufficient, however. In 406 the Vandals descended on the city and pillaged it. The inhabitants fled to the Christian cathedral, where the bishop Nicasius of Rheims was decapitated on the doorstep while trying to slow them down. In 451 the Huns attacked. Hardly anything is left from this period except some traces of fortifications and the Roman road system that had not been changed. It seems the city was burned down and rebuilt several times, but little can still be found since the inhabitants, much poorer now, used cheap and easy to work but perishable materials such as wood, straw and clay.  Archaeology  Extensive excavations have been made since the 19th century at city extensions, the new railway station, etc. They have revealed the Roman houses, the gate of Mars, the sanctuary on the rue Belin, the forum, thermae, and the necropolis at the exits of the city.

History The Romans under Nero Claudius Drusus established a military outpost belonging to the Germania Superior Roman province close to a Gaulish village near the banks of the Rhine, at the current location of Strasbourg, and named it Argentoratum. Its name was first mentioned in 12 BC but \\"Argentorate\\" is the toponym of the Gaulish settlement that preceded it before being latinised, though it is not known by how long.Petit historique de Strasbourg From 90 AD the Legio VIII Augusta permanently stationed in Argentoratum.Le camp de la Legio VIII Augusta √† Strasbourg The Roman camp of Argentoratum then included a cavalry section and covered an area of approximately , from approximately in Tiberian times.4 rue Br√ªl√©e Other Roman legions temporarily stationed in Argentoratum were the Legio XIV Gemina and the Legio XXI Rapax, the latter during the reign of Nero.Argentorate sous N√©ron Brick bearing the stamp of the Legio VIII Augusta, found in Rue du D√¥me (Mus√©e historique de Strasbourg) The Alemanni fought a Battle of Argentoratum against Rome in 357 AD. They were defeated by Julian, later Emperor of Rome, and their king Chnodomar was taken prisoner. On 2 January 366 the Alemanni crossed the frozen Rhine in large numbers, to invade the Roman Empire. From the 4th century, Strasbourg was the seat of the Bishopric of Strasbourg (made an Archbishopric in 1988). Early in the 5th century the Alemanni appear to have crossed the Rhine, conquered, and then settled what is today Alsace and a large part of Switzerland. From this period on Argentoratum disappears from historical records and is replaced by the toponym \\"Stratisburgum\\".

History Regional districts came into being as an order of government in 1965 with the enactment of amendments to the Municipal Act. Until the creation of regional districts, the only local form of government in British Columbia was incorporated municipalities, and services in areas outside municipal boundaries had to be sought from the province or through improvement districts. Government structure Similar to counties in other parts of Canada, regional districts serve only to provide municipal services as the local government in areas not incorporated into a municipality, and in certain regional affairs of shared concern between residents of unincorporated areas and those in the municipalities such as a stakeholder role in regional planning. In those predominantly rural areas, regional districts provide services such as land use planning, building inspection, solid-waste management, and some responsibility for community fire protection. Regional districts have no powers like other arms of government, whose powers are much more sweeping, including jurisdiction over forests, the environment, health, schools, and provincial courts. Most land within a regional district is under control of other arms of the provincial government, or in the case of national parks and offshore waters, of the federal government. Indian reserves located within the boundaries of regional districts are likewise excluded from their jurisdiction and infrastructure, and there are varying levels of collaboration between First Nations governments and regional district boards. Regional districts are governed by boards of directly and indirectly elected directors. Municipalities appoint directors to represent their populations (usually the mayors), while residents of unincorporated areas (which are grouped into electoral areas) elect directors directly. The votes of directors from municipalities generally count more than the votes of directors from electoral areas, and larger municipalities have more votes than smaller ones. For example, both North Saanich and Metchosin appoint one director to the Capital Regional District board of directors, but the vote of North Saanich's director counts three times as much as the vote of Metchosin's appointee.British Columbia Ministry of Community Services, \\"Primer on Regional Districts in British Columbia,\\" 2006.

(The Tuileries Palace, which housed the Convention, is on the left) The Committee of General Security () was a French parliamentary committee which acted as police agency during the French Revolution that, along with the Committee of Public Safety, oversaw the Reign of Terror. The Committee supervised the local police committees in charge of investigating reports of treason, and was one of the agencies with authority to refer suspects to the Revolutionary Tribunal for trial and possible execution by guillotine.sourcebook.fsc.edu The Committee of General Security was established as a committee of the National Convention in October 1792. It was designed to protect the Revolutionary Republic from its internal enemies. By 1794 the Committee became part of the opposition to Robespierre and the Committee of Public Safety and members were involved in the 9 Thermidor coup d'√©tat.www.bartleby.com On 4 November 1795, along with the end of the National Convention, the Committee of General Security dissolved.  Origins and evolution  On 2 October 1792, the National Convention created the Committee of General Security from its predecessors: the Search Committee (Comit√© des recherches) and the Committee of Surveillance (Comit√© de Surveillance). The Committee was not large and never exceeded 16 members. The Committee's main responsibility was the internal security of France and to protect the Republic from both external and internal enemies. One way of ensuring the security of France was through the passport system. Through this system the members of the Committee had the knowledge of who was entering France and where they were going. The Committee had the authority to decide who was sent to the Revolutionary Tribunal for judgment during the Reign of Terror. Once the evidence was fully considered in an individual case the members of the Committee made the decision on the innocence or guilt of the suspect, which determined if that person would be released or sent to the Tribunal. Throughout, the existence of the committee it contributed to a large number of people being sent to the guillotine. On March 29, 1794, the committee ordered twenty-four former members of the parlements of Paris and Toulouse to be sent to the Tribunal, where they were subsequently executed. Shortly after, another twenty-eight people that were a part of the Farmers-General, were investigated by the Committee and sent to the Tribunal for trial. After the trial the men were found guilty and executed. A proposal of Danton on 13 September 1793 marked a turning point in the composition of the committee: from then on its members were appointed directly by the Committee of Public Safety and were no more than twelve in number. The regulation of 19 October 1793 stated that the committee should sit every day from eight o'clock till eleven o'clock in the evening, later if circumstances required that. The Law of 14 Frimaire (4 December 1793), voted on the report of Billaud-Varenne, restored a degree of equality between the two committees. On 16 April 1794 the Committee of Public Safety received the power to search and to bring the accused before the Revolutionary Tribunal, in the same way as the Committee of General Security. The Committee of General Security and the Committee of Public Safety worked alongside one another. Their responsibilities became overlapping which caused tensions between the two groups. The Law of 22 Prairial year II (10 June 1794) deepened this rivalry as it enabled the two committees to send the accused directly before the Revolutionary Tribunal. The law was introduced to the public without consultation from the Committee of General Security, which, in turn, doubled the number of executions permitted by the Committee of Public Safety. On 22 and 23 July the two committees met in a plenary session. Saint- Just declared in negotiations with Bar√®re to be prepared to make concessions on the subordinate position of the Committee of General Security.Albert Soboul, p. 345, 347Choosing Terror: Virtue, Friendship, and Authenticity in the French Revolution by Marisa Linton Couthon agreed with more cooperation between the two committees. For Robespierre, the Committee of General Security had to remain subordinate to the Committee of Public Safety. Both committees were responsible for suppressing counterrevolution, but ended targeting each other. Deep Republicanism: Prelude to Professionalism by Donald Clark Hodges, p. 94 The tensions grew and contributed to the downfall of Robespierre. One example of the rising tension was when two members of the Committee of General Security, Jean-Pierre-Andr√© Amar and Marc-Guillaume Alexis Vadier, participated in the 9 Thermidor coup against Robespierre. During the same time at the National Convention, Vadier also used false accusations implementing Catherine Th√©ot in a plot to overthrow the Republic, which was also connected to Robespierre and the Cult of the Supreme Being. The Committee of General Security had more than 160 employees on the eve of the 9 Thermidor. The Committee of General Security dissolved with the end of the National Convention in November 1795. Prominent members The Committee of General Security had a significant number of members : though there were numerous members of the Convention elected in the Committee between over its three year history from 2 October 1792-November 4, 1795 it numbered only 12 at the start of the Reign of Terror. * Jean-Paul Marat * Marc-Guillaume Alexis Vadier * Jacques-Louis David * Jean-Pierre-Andr√© Amar * Philippe-Fran√ßois-Joseph Le Bas * Jean-Henri Voulland * Pierre Joseph Duhem * √âlie Lacoste * Joseph-Nicolas Barbeau du Barran  See also  * Committee of Public Safety * National Convention * Revolutionary Tribunal * Reign of Terror References Source * Le Comit√© de s√ªret√© g√©n√©rale (1792-1795) par Emilia Cadio 1791 events of the French Revolution 1792 events of the French Revolution 1793 events of the French Revolution 1794 events of the French Revolution 1795 events of the French Revolution 1791 establishments in France 1795 disestablishments French National Convention ","title":"Committee of General Security"},{"id":"1367289","text":"AY and variants may refer to: Language * Aymara language (ISO-639 alpha-2 code AY) * Ay, transliteration of Volap√ºk √Ñ and √§ People * A.Y.

He is the former County Executive of Erie County, New York. Early life Giambra was born in Buffalo, New York in 1951 to a single mother, Shirley. He was raised in Buffalo by his mother and his grandmother. He lived in the Lakeview Housing Project, near the east bank of the Niagara River. Giambra later said, \\"It was an environment where everybody was poor but we didn‚Äôt know it.\\" His mother eventually married Salvatore \\"Babe\\" Panaro. Giambra considers Panaro to be his father. His mother and stepfather had a daughter, Angela. The family was Roman Catholic. Giambra attended Grover Cleveland High School and Erie Community College. Political career Joel Giambra (at Center in Beige Suit) Speaking at Italian Festival, Buffalo, NY, 2000 Giambra was one of the youngest Buffalo Common Council members ever, and also served as Buffalo City Comptroller early in his career. He was a Democrat who changed his political affiliation to Republican in 1999 to better position himself to run for County Executive. He was seen as a future statewide candidate and in 2002 was considered by Governor George Pataki as a running mate for lieutenant governor, before Lt. Gov. Mary Donohue was nominated for reelection. Investigations into the mismanagement of a highway garage and exorbitant prices paid for county office furniture to a Giambra campaign contributor preceded the 2005 budget problems. Then-New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer initiated a lawsuit against the furniture company for the overcharges. Some have accused Giambra of providing lucrative jobs to associates. His county staff measured 18, while Monroe County's executive had only four staffers and then downsized to three. Giambra's boyhood friend Victor Getz was particularly singled out for notice, for his salary as an executive assistant and driver to Giambra. A panel appointed by Giambra found that Giambra's and other county employees' salaries should be raised by 40%. Giambra lowered or declined to raise county taxes for years for a total of 31% lower taxes, financing his budget partly through the use of surpluses from the previous county administration and monies from the tobacco settlement. The county then had to accept either massive reductions of services or increases in taxation. Giambra said that \\"an end to county government as we know it\\" would occur without a sales tax hike, ending county libraries, snowplows and road patrols. Giambra proposed this \\"red budget\\" of $940 million which eliminated services, and after failed negotiations to raise the sales tax in a \\"green budget\\" of $1 billion, a modified plan was adopted which laid off 2,000 county employees and closed many county services, including the Parks Department. In 2005, a Control Board was implemented by the state to monitor county finances. This, coupled with an investigation into patronage positions, led to Giambra's announcement that he would not seek reelection in 2007. In April 2006, Giambra said that the \\"War on Drugs\\" was being lost and models used successfully in other countries of decriminalizing certain drugs and thus reducing violence associated with the illegal drug trade needed to be examined. The Buffalo News published an Op-Ed agreeing with Giambra's statements that drug legalization should be studied further. Since 2012, Giambra has been the co-host of the political debate program 2 Sides on WGRZ. In 2018, Giambra announced he was a candidate for the Republican nomination for Governor of New York Giambra described himself as a \\"socially moderate\\" Republican, a supporter of campaign finance reform, and an opponent of corporate welfare. Conservative Party Chairman Michael R. Long \\"flatly reject[ed] Giambra who...[has made] significant donations to [Democrats such as] [Gov. Andrew] Cuomo, Assembly Speaker Carl E. Heastie, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and 2016 presidential nominee Hillary Clinton [and supports] abortion rights, same sex marriage, gun control and marijuana legalization.\\" After failing to generate support from Republicans, Giambra withdrew his name as a Republican candidate on March 1 and instead sought the nomination of the Reform Party of New York State.

It is one of the last significant Victorian novels to have been published in monthly parts. The novel is Trollope's longest, comprising 100 chapters, and is particularly rich in sub-plot. It was inspired by the financial scandals of the early 1870s; Trollope had just returned to England from abroad, and was appalled by the greed and dishonesty those scandals exposed. This novel was his rebuke. It dramatised how such greed and dishonesty pervaded the commercial, political, moral, and intellectual life of that era. Writing and publication Trollope began writing The Way We Live Now on May 1, 1873, five months after returning from an extended trip to Australia and New Zealand. He paused work in order to write the shorter novel Harry Heathcote of Gangoil, a Christmas novel he had already promised his publisher, but he resumed work on The Way We Live Now by July. It was completed on 22 December 1873, and the first of twenty monthly installments was published by Chapman & Hall beginning in February 1874. Chapman & Hall had purchased the rights for both the serialisation and the full novel for ¬£3,000. However, the serialisation sold badly, prompting the publisher to release the full novel in a two volume form in June 1875, four months before the serialisation was set to finish. The two volume first editions were large octavos occupied by the unsold pages from the serialised printings. As outlined in Trollope's notes, the original outline for The Way We Live Now centred on Lady Carbury as the main character (Trollope referred to it as the \\"Carbury novel\\"). It was therefore meant to be more of a satire of the literary world in which Lady Carbury circulates, with subplots involving Lady Carbury's children (the outline for the Hetta Carbury-Paul Montague-Roger Carbury love triangle is present from the early notes). Trollope envisioned Melmotte, originally intended to be a minor character, first as an American, then later as a Frenchman. Several real-life figures have been proposed as the inspiration for Augustus Melmotte: the French financier Charles Lefevre, as well as the Irish swindler John Sadlier, who like Melmotte committed suicide with prussic acid when his schemes unraveled. Another suggested inspiration for Melmotte is 'King' Hudson, a railway speculator in the 1840s whose prodigious wealth allowed him to live in an ostentatious home in Knightsbridge, where he entertained the highest members of the English aristocracy. He was consequently discredited for his business activities, and died abroad in 1871, just a couple of years before Trollope began work on The Way We Live Now. Plot summary Augustus Melmotte is a financier with a mysterious past. He is rumoured to have Jewish origins, and to be connected to some failed businesses in Vienna. When he moves his business and his family to London, the city's upper crust begins buzzing with rumours about him‚Äîand a host of people ultimately find their lives changed because of him. Melmotte sets up his office in the City of London and purchases a fine house in Grosvenor Square. He sets out to woo rich and powerful investors by hosting a lavish party. He finds an appropriate investment vehicle when he is approached by an American entrepreneur, Hamilton K. Fisker, to float a company to construct a new railway line running from Salt Lake City, USA, to Veracruz, Mexico. Melmotte's goal is to ramp up the share price without paying any of his own money into the scheme itself, thus further enriching himself, regardless of whether the line gets built. Amongst the aristocrats on the company's board is Sir Felix Carbury, a dissolute young baronet who is quickly running through his widowed mother's savings. In an attempt to restore their fortunes, as they are being beset by their creditors, his mother, Matilda, Lady Carbury‚Äîwho is embarking on a writing career‚Äîendeavours to have him become engaged to Marie, Melmotte's only child, and thus a considerable heiress. Sir Felix manages to win Marie's heart, but his schemes are blocked by Melmotte, who has no intention of allowing his daughter to marry a penniless aristocrat. Felix's situation is also complicated by his relationship with Ruby Ruggles, a pretty farm girl living with her grandfather on the estate of Roger Carbury, his well-off cousin. In the South Central Pacific and Mexican Railway Board meetings, chaired and controlled by Melmotte, Fisker's partner, Paul Montague, raises difficult questions. Paul's personal life is also complicated. He falls in love with Lady Carbury's young and beautiful daughter Hetta‚Äîmuch to her mother's displeasure‚Äîbut has been followed to England by a former American fianc√©e, Mrs Winifred Hurtle. Mrs Hurtle is determined to make Paul marry her based on the fact that they had lived together in America, and that she offered him \\"all that a woman can give\\". It is Lady Carbury's plan, advised by her literary friend Mr Broune, a distinguished London publisher, for Hetta to marry her cousin Roger. Roger has been Paul's mentor, and the two come into conflict over their attentions towards Hetta, who steadfastly refuses to marry her cousin. Events start to come to a head when Paul finally gets Mrs Hurtle's consent to free him of his obligations towards her, in exchange for agreeing to spend one final weekend with her at the coastal town of Lowestoft. Whilst walking along the sands, they meet Roger Carbury, who, on seeing Paul with another woman, decides to break off all acquaintance with him, believing that Paul is simply playing with Hetta's affections. In the meantime, Felix Carbury is torn between his affection for Ruby and his financial need to pursue Marie Melmotte. Ruby, after being beaten by her grandfather for not marrying a respectable local miller, John Crumb, runs away to London and finds refuge in the boarding house owned by her aunt, Mrs Pipkin‚Äîwhere, as it happens, Mrs Hurtle is lodging. Felix learns from Ruby about Mrs Hurtle's relationship with Paul and, coming into conflict with Mrs Hurtle over his attentions to Ruby, reveals all his new-found knowledge to his mother and sister. Hetta is devastated and breaks off her engagement to Paul. Meanwhile, to keep Paul away from the board meetings, Melmotte attempts to send Paul off to Mexico on a nominal inspection trip of the railway line, but Paul declines to go. Finding that they cannot get around Melmotte, Felix and Marie decide to elope to America. Marie steals a blank cheque from her father and arranges to meet Felix on the ship at Liverpool. Felix, who has been given money by Marie for his expenses, goes to his club and gambles it all away in a card game against Miles Grendall, whom Felix had detected cheating in a previous game. Drunk and penniless, Felix returns to his mother's house, knowing the game is up. Meanwhile, after Melmotte has been alerted by his bank, Marie and her maid, who believe that Felix is already on the ship at Liverpool, are intercepted by the police before they can board the ship, and Marie is brought back to London. Melmotte, who by this time has also become Member of Parliament for Westminster and the purchaser of a grand country estate belonging to Mr Longestaffe (whose daughter Georgiana is the heroine of a lengthy satirical subplot), also knows that his financial house of cards is nearing collapse. When Longestaffe and his son demand the purchase money for the estate Melmotte had bought, Melmotte forges his daughter's name to a document that will allow him to get at her money (money that Melmotte had put in her name precisely to protect it from creditors, and which Marie refused to give back to him). He tries to get his clerk, Croll, to witness the forged signature. Croll refuses. Melmotte then also forges Croll's signature, but makes the mistake of leaving the documents with Mr Brehgert, a banker. When Brehgert returns the documents to Croll, rather than to Melmotte, Croll discovers the forgery and leaves Melmotte's service. With his creditors now knocking at his door, the railway shares nearly worthless, charges of forgery looming in his future, and his political reputation in tatters after a drunken appearance in the House of Commons, Melmotte poisons himself. The remainder of the novel ties up the loose ends. While Felix is out with Ruby one evening, John Crumb comes upon them and, believing that Felix is forcing his attentions on her, thoroughly beats Felix. Ruby finally realises that Felix will never marry her, and returns home to marry John. Felix is forced to live by his wits on the Continent. Lady Carbury marries Mr Broune, who has been a true friend to her throughout her troubles. Hetta and Paul are finally reconciled after he tells her the truth about Mrs Hurtle; Roger forgives Paul and allows the couple to live at Carbury Manor, which he vows to leave to their child. Marie, now financially independent, becomes acquainted with Hamilton K. Fisker, and agrees to go with him to San Francisco, where she eventually marries him. She is accompanied by her stepmother, Madame Melmotte; Croll, who marries Madame Melmotte; and Mrs Hurtle. Adaptations The novel was adapted for television in 1969 and 2001 by the BBC. The 2001 adaptation aired on the American network PBS as well. It was also adapted for radio (and re-set in the present day) as a 2008 Woman's Hour drama serial under the title The Way We Live Right Now. Trollope's own views of his novel In his autobiography, Trollope described his motivations for writing the novel as follows: > Nevertheless a certain class of dishonesty, dishonesty magnificent in its > proportions, and climbing into high places, has become at the same time so > rampant and so splendid that there seems to be reason for fearing that men > and women will be taught to feel that dishonesty, if it can become splendid, > will cease to be abominable. If dishonesty can live in a gorgeous palace > with pictures on all its walls, and gems in all its cupboards, with marble > and ivory in all its corners, and can give Apician dinners, and get into > Parliament, and deal in millions, then dishonesty is not disgraceful, and > the man dishonest after such a fashion is not a low scoundrel. Instigated, I > say, by some such reflections as these, I sat down in my new house to write > The Way We Live Now.Trollope, An Autobiography, chapter XX. Trollope wrote that The Way We Live Now \\"was, as a satire, powerful and good. The character of Melmotte is well maintained. The Beargarden is amusing,‚Äîand not untrue.... [T]he young lady with her two lovers [referring to Hetta] is weak and vapid....\\" Hetta, Roger, and Paul were all \\"uninteresting,\\" in his view. \\"The interest of the story,\\" he wrote, \\"lies among the wicked and foolish people,‚Äîwith Melmotte and his daughter, with the American woman, Mrs Hurtle, and with John Crumb and the girl of his heart. ... Upon the whole,\\" Trollope wrote, \\"I by no means look upon the book as one of my failures....\\"Trollope, Anthony. An Autobiography, Vol. 2, pp. 212‚Äì13.

B√©nichou first achieved prominence in 1948 with Morales du grand si√®cle, his work on the social context of the French seventeenth-century classics. Later B√©nichou undertook a prodigious research program, seeking to understand the radical pessimism and disappointment expressed by mid-nineteenth writers. This project resulted in a series of major works, beginning with Le Sacre de l‚Äô√©crivain, 1750-1830 (1973; Eng. trans. 1999 [The Consecration of the Writer, 1750-1830]). A 1995 volume, Selon Mallarm√©, may be considered an extension of this series. Together, these works amount to an important reinterpretation of French romanticism. Critic Tzvetan Todorov described B√©nichou‚Äôs special interest as ‚Äúthe thought of poets.‚Äù More generally, though, Paul B√©nichou‚Äôs work contributed to the understanding of the creative writer's place in modernity, and illuminated the role of writers in legitimating the institutions and values of modern society. Early years B√©nichou was born in Tlemcen, French Algeria (now Tlemcen, Algeria), to an Algerian Jewish family. His intellectual brilliance soon called him to Paris. He had won the annual concours g√©n√©ral des lyc√©es for best th√®me latin in his final year of secondary school at the lyc√©e d'Oran. After the baccalaur√©at (1924), he came to the Lyc√©e Louis-le-Grand in Paris to prepare the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure at the time a school of the University of Paris; he was successful in 1926 and studied there, where Jean-Paul Sartre, Raymond Aron, Paul Nizan and Maurice Merleau-Ponty were among his fellow students. He obtained his license in 1927 and his agr√©gation in 1930, then becoming a secondary teacher. During his student years B√©nichou was active in radical politics and literary surrealism, writing poetry; his name is mentioned in Maurice Nadeau‚Äôs Histoire du surr√©alisme. But it was as a scholar and a teacher that B√©nichou made his mark. While teaching in French secondary schools he had all but completed his first major work, Morales du grand si√®cle, when Hitler unleashed his blitzkrieg. After the disaster of 1940 and the installation of the virulently anti-Semitic Vichy regime, B√©nichou, as a Jew, was denied the right to earn his livelihood by teaching in French schools, and as an Algerian Jew, found himself stripped of French nationality.In 1870 the Algerian natives of Jewish religion had been given the French citizenship, contrary to the Muslim natives. In 1940 Vichy abolished this decision. After living in the French unoccupied zone, B√©nichou could leave in 1942 with his family to Argentina, where he had been offered a teaching position in the university of Mendoza; afterwards, he taught in Buenos Aires, at the Institut Fran√ßais (co-founded by Roger Caillois). While in the Argentine capital he participated in literary circles and met Jorge Luis Borges, whom he and his daughter, Sylvia Roubaud, would later translate; he also developed a scholarly interest in medieval Spanish literature and published groundbreaking work on the Spanish romancero. The publication and critical success of Morales du grand si√®cle (1948; Eng. trans. 1971 [Man and Ethics]) established his scholarly reputation; the volume has never gone out of print and has sold more than 100,000 copies. But it had been refused as a doctoral work and Paul B√©nichou could therefore not become a University teacher in France. Returned to Paris in 1949, he got a position at the prestigious Lyc√©e Condorcet, where Marcel Proust studied in the 1880s; he continued to teach there until 1958. \\"The Consecration of the Writer\\" It was in the early 1950s that B√©nichou undertook his most ambitious and important scholarly project. He had always been struck by the pessimism of the great French writers of the mid-nineteenth century‚Äîthat of Charles Baudelaire in particular. What could account for Baudelaire‚Äôs radical pessimism, shared by writers like Gustave Flaubert, in an era of general confidence, progress, and hope? For twenty years, B√©nichou researched the history of ideas about creative writers‚Äô relation to society. This research culminated in a series of major works that purport to solve this problem. (Ironically, B√©nichou never wrote a major work on Baudelaire, though he published a number of significant essays on the author of Les Fleurs du mal.) Taken together, these works constitute a coherent study of French literature and thought from 1750 to 1898, analyzing the spiritual predicament of modern France and shedding light on the literature of other Western nations as well as on contemporary problems of global civilization. These interrelated works, which B√©nichou began to publish only at the age of 65, are: * Le Sacre de l'√©crivain (1973; English translation 1999 [‚Äô‚ÄôThe Consecration of the Writer‚Äô‚Äô]) * Le Temps des proph√®tes (1977) * Les Mages romantiques (1988) * L'√âcole du d√©senchantement (1992) * Selon Mallarm√© (1995) The first four works were republished posthumously by Gallimard in a two-volume set under the title Romantismes fran√ßais (2004). In the middle of this gargantuan intellectual undertaking, B√©nichou was invited to teach at Harvard University, where he taught one semester a year from 1959 until his retirement from teaching in 1979. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1976. In his later years, B√©nichou remained active and in good health, working in his apartment on the rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs in the Montparnasse district of Paris. He continued to write and publish; when he died in Paris, at the age of 92, he was writing a commentary on the haunting, enigmatic poems by G√©rard de Nerval known as The Chimeras. He is interred in Paris‚Äôs Cimeti√®re du P√®re- Lachaise, not far from the tomb of Fr√©d√©ric Chopin. B√©nichou‚Äôs ideas B√©nichou considered modernity the product of a religiously grounded society faced with a decline in the credibility of its ideological and religious foundations. This decline occurred at the same time as, and to a large extent as the result of, the rise of a belief in the essential self-sufficiency of human beings, belief in human autonomy being a hallmark of the Enlightenment. The Enlightenment was accompanied by a widespread hope for a regenerating elite that would help usher in a new, more just social order. The ‚Äúconsecration of the writer‚Äù emerged from these two complementary though divergent tendencies in the period from 1760 to 1789, during which the writer‚Äôs mission was widely believed to be that of guiding humanity to the promised land of the new order. The traumatic experience of the French Revolution modified this program, bringing about a convergence of two tendencies that had, till then, been divergent. On the one hand, the secular, anti-religious tendencies of the Enlightenment were modified, becoming more accommodating of religious notions, as seen in different ways in the work of Germaine de Sta√´l, Benjamin Constant, and Victor Cousin, among others. On the other hand, the experience of the Revolution and the failure of its initial hopes contributed to a religious revival, seen in the works of Chateaubriand, Balanche, and Lamartine. It is to this \\"deep convergence,\\" as B√©nichou put it, that the consecration of the poet-thinker is due, in the heyday of French romanticism in the years after 1820. The changes B√©nichou describes were brought about by \\"the rise of an intellectual corps possessing new prestige and a new social make-up,\\" a \\"corps\\" that emerged transfigured after the Revolution to lay claim to \\"spiritual authority\\" (The Consecration of the Writer, p. 339). In B√©nichou's work, \\"spiritual authority\\" is a key concept, though he never defines it concisely. From the body of B√©nichou's writing, however, emerges a vision of humanity with deep-rooted needs both for belief and a social doctrine of legitimation capable of enlisting the support of society generally. In France, the Roman Catholic Church traditionally fulfilled this role, but a \\"new spiritual power [was] born in the eighteenth century from the disrepute of the old Church\\" (ibid., p. 331). It was the rise of this \\"philosophic faith\\" (which B√©nichou also calls the \\"faith of the eighteenth century,\\" the \\"modern faith,\\" the \\"new faith,\\" \\"philosophical humanism,\\" and the \\"secular faith\\") that initiated the crisis of modernity. B√©nichou and the problem of modernity For B√©nichou, then, the problem of modernity is essentially that of belief. Romanticism is \\"the vast prologue or first important act of a longer history that continues in our own time\\" (The Consecration of the Writer, p. 9), or, intellectually, as \\"the general debate, which still goes on, between the freedom of thought and expression [la libert√© critique] and dogma\\" (Le Temps des proph√®tes, p. 11). Historically, this debate first emerges in earnest in the 16th century. The key to the drama, in B√©nichou's view, is the weakening of the West's traditional \\"spiritual power.\\" Modernity appears as an extended period of conflict among various efforts to redefine what such a power might be in the future. Independent writers have, in these circumstances, offered a social location for a secular version of \\"spiritual authority\\"‚Äîthe pouvoir spiritual la√Øque of the subtitle to Le Sacre de l'√©crivain. Historians who ignore this issue in favor of dimensions that are exclusively social, economic, or political are missing something essential, in B√©nichou's view. \\"The Romantic period, in the final analysis, corresponds to an enormous effort to give a corrected edition of the system of the Enlightenment that would be free of the unfortunate aspects that the Terror had caused to stand out so strikingly,\\" B√©nichou said in a late interview (\\"Parcours de l'√©crivain,\\" Le D√©bat (Mar.-Apr. 1989), p. 25). But consensus on the role of the writer was short-lived. Already shaken in the aftermath of the July Revolution of 1830, after 1848 the poet-thinker ceased to be a credible spiritual authority in the eyes of bourgeois society. In France, the Church resumed its status as the official spiritual power. Modern conservatism began to emerge, as \\"the eighteenth century begins to be the object of a vast intellectual disapproval\\" (ibid., p. 28). But poets, writers, and artists, for their part, were unwilling to lay down their claims to spiritual authority. Instead, they became \\"disenchanted\\"‚Äîa disenchantment that has continued to the present day and that has even been institutionalized in many artistic circles. B√©nichou's critical method Finally, Paul B√©nichou's critical method depends on an interpretive ideal of plausibilit√© ('plausibility' or 'credibility'), i.e. fidelity to the thought embodied in the work, so that any interpretation of a work ought, at least in principle, to be acceptable to its author. He viewed structuralism, post-structuralism, and enthusiasm for literary theory in literary criticism with skepticism. In his view, these are inherently flawed approaches, in that they tend to reduce the work of literature to one of its modalities. B√©nichou insisted, instead, that a work of literature is inherently heterogeneous and multifaceted. His hostility to single-minded approaches to criticism and disdain for popular contemporary critical schools delayed appreciation of his work during his own lifetime, but this neglect seems, paradoxically, to have contributed to its long-term vitality.

They are alkaline silica-undersaturated mafic or ultramafic rocks with high magnesium oxide, >3% potassium oxide, high sodium oxide and high nickel and chromium. Lamprophyres occur throughout all geologic eras. Archaean examples are commonly associated with lode gold deposits. Cenozoic examples include magnesian rocks in Mexico and South America, and young ultramafic lamprophyres from Gympie in Australia with 18.5% MgO at ~250 Ma.  Petrology  Modern science treats lamprophyres as a catch-all term for ultrapotassic mafic igneous rocks which have primary mineralogy consisting of amphibole or biotite, and with feldspar in the groundmass. Lamprophyres are not amenable to classification according to modal proportions, such as the system QAPF due to peculiar mineralogy, nor compositional discrimination diagrams, such as TAS because of their peculiar geochemistry. They are classified under the IUGS Nomenclature for Igneous Rocks (Le Maitre et al., 1989) separately; this is primarily because they are rare, have peculiar mineralogy and do not fit classical classification schemes. For example, the TAS scheme is inappropriate due to the control of mineralogy by potassium, not by calcium or sodium. Mitchell has suggested that rocks belonging to the \\"lamprophyre facies\\" are characterized by the presence of phenocrysts of mica and/or amphibole together with lesser clinopyroxene and/or melilite set in a groundmass which may consist (either singly or in various combinations) of plagioclase, alkali feldspar, feldspathoids, carbonate, monticellite, melilite, mica, amphibole, pyroxene, perovskite, Fe- Ti oxides and glass. Classification schemes which include genetic information, may be required to properly describe lamprophyres.  Genesis  Rock considered lamprophyres are part of a \\"clan\\" of rocks, with similar mineralogy, textures and genesis. Lamprophyres are similar to lamproites and kimberlites. While modern concepts see orangeites, lamproites and kimberlites as separate, a vast majority of lamprophyres have similar origins to these other rock types. Mitchell considered the lamprophyres as a \\"facies\\" of igneous rocks created by a set of conditions (generally; late, highly volatile differentiates of other rock types). Either scheme may apply to some, but not all, occurrences and variations of the broader group of rocks known as lamprophyres and melilitic rocks. Leaving aside complex petrogenetic arguments, it is fair to say that the essential components in lamprophyre genesis are; * high depth of melting, which yields more mafic magmas; * low degrees of partial melting, which yields magmas rich in the alkalis (particularly potassium); * lithophile element (K, Ba, Cs, Rb) enrichment, high Ni and Cr, * high potassium and sodium concentrations (silica undersaturation is common) * some form of volatile enrichment, to provide the biotite (phlogopite) and amphibole (pargasite) mineralogy * lack of fractional crystallisation (generally; there are exceptions) * high Mg# ( MgO/(FeO + MgO) ) Individual examples thus may have a wide variety of mineralogy and mechanisms for formation. Rock considered lamprophyres to be derived from deep, volatile-driven melting in a subduction zone setting. Others such as Mitchell consider them to be late offshoots of plutons, etc., though this can be difficult to reconcile with their primitive melt chemistry and mineralogy.  Petrography  Microscope view (long dimension 2 mm) of a thin section of minette from the Colorado Plateau. Magnesium-rich biotite (P, phlogopite) and clinopyroxene (C) phenocrysts in a groundmass of alkali feldspar, pyroxene, and iron-titanium oxides. Lamprophyres are a group of rocks containing phenocrysts, usually of biotite and amphibole (with bright cleavage surfaces), and pyroxene, but not of feldspar. They are thus distinguished from the porphyries and porphyrites in which the feldspar has crystallized in two generations. They are essentially dike rocks, occurring as dikes and thin sills, and are also found as marginal facies of plutonic intrusions. They are usually dark in color, owing to the abundance of ferro-magnesian silicates, of high specific gravity and liable to decomposition. For these reasons they have been defined as a melanocrate series (rich in the dark minerals); and they are often accompanied by a complementary leucocrate series (rich in the white minerals feldspar and quartz) such as aplites, porphyries and felsites. Biotite (usually phlogopite) and amphibole (usually pargasite or other magnesian hornblende) are panidiomorphic; all are euhedral, well formed. Feldspar is restricted to the ground mass. In many lamprophyres the pale quartz and felspathic ingredients tend to occur in rounded spots, or ocelli, in which there has been progressive crystallization from the margins towards the center. These spots may consist of radiate or brush-like feldspars (with some phlogopite and hornblende) or of quartz and feldspar. A central area of quartz or of analcite probably represents an original miarolitic cavity infilled at a later period. The presence or absence of the four dominant minerals, orthoclase, plagioclase, biotite and hornblende, determines the species: *Minette contains biotite and orthoclase.Johannsen, A., 1937, A Descriptive Petrography of the Igneous Rocks: Volume III, The Intermediate Rocks. University of Chicago Press, Chicago, Illinois *Kersantite contains biotite and plagioclase. *Vogesite contains hornblende and orthoclase. *Spessartite contains hornblende and plagioclase. Each variety of lamprophyre may and often does contain all four minerals but is named according to the two which predominate. These rocks contain also iron oxides (usually titaniferous), apatite, sometimes sphene, augite, and olivine. The hornblende and biotite are brown or greenish-brown, and as a rule their crystals even when small are very perfect and give the thin section views an easily recognizable character. Green hornblende occurs in some of these rocks. Augite exists as euhedral crystals of pale green color, often zonal and readily weathering. Olivine in the fresh state is rare; it forms rounded, corroded grains; in many cases it is decomposed to green or colorless hornblende in radiating nests (pilite). The plagioclase occurs as small rectangular crystals; orthoclase may have similar shapes or may be fibrous and grouped in sheaf-like aggregates that are narrow in the middle and spread out towards both ends. As all lamprophyres are prone to alteration by weathering a great abundance of secondary minerals is usually found in them; the principal are calcite and other carbonates, limonite, chlorite, quartz and kaolin. Ocellar structure is common; the ocelli consist mainly of orthoclase and quartz, and may be up to one quarter of an inch in diameter. Another feature of these rocks is the presence of large foreign crystals, or xenocrysts, of feldspar and of quartz. Their forms are rounded, indicating partial resorption and the quartz may be surrounded by corrosion borders of minerals such as augite and hornblende produced where the magma is attacking the crystal. Lamprophyres (including minette) traditionally have been defined as:Le Maitre, R. W., editor, 2002, Igneous Rocks: A Classification and Glossary of Terms. Recommendations of the International Union of Geological Sciences, Subcommission of the Systematics of Igneous Rocks. Cambridge University Press. * normally occurring as porphyritic dikes * containing matrix restricted feldspars and/or feldspathoids if present * biotite or phlogopite is an essential mineral phase * commonly extensively hydrothermally altered * may contain primary calcite, zeolites and other more typically hydrothermal minerals * higher than normal contents of K2O and/or Na2O, H2O, CO2, S, P2O5, and Ba On a purely chemical basis, an extrusive lamprophyre (sp. minette) might be classified as potassic trachybasalt, shoshonite, or latite using the total alkali-silica diagram (see TAS classification), or as absarokite, shoshonite, or banakite using a classification sometimes applied to potassium- rich lavas. Such chemical classifications ignore the distinctive textures and mineralogies of lamprophyres.  Nomenclature  The naming and classification of lamprophyres has had several revisions, and much argument within the geological community. Nicholas Rock and colleagues devoted much time to a complicated descriptive system of nomenclature which took after a series of nomenclature based on regional examples of the very diverse mineralogical expression of lamprophyres. This system was based on a somewhat provincial, rustic system of naming after French villages nearby were found the first described examples of various species of lamprophyre (Vosges being the prime example). Modern nomenclature has been derived from an attempt to constrain some genetic parameters of lamprophyre genesis.Mitchell, R.H., 1994b. Suggestions for revisions to the terminology of kimberlites and lamprophyres from a genetic viewpoint. In Proc. Fifth Int. Kimberlite Conf. 1. Kimberlites and Related Rocks and Mantle Xenoliths (H.O.A. Meyer & O.H. Leonardos, eds.). Companhia de Pesquisa de Recursos Minerais (Brasilia), Spec. Publ. 1/A, 15-26. This has, by and large, dispensed with the previous provincial names of lamprophyre species, in favor of a mineralogical name. The old names are still used for convenience. = Vogesite = Vogesite was first described from the Vosges mountains, France, where rocks of this type (actually, minette) were described in the early 20th century. = Minette = A dike of minette near Shiprock, Navajo Volcanic Field A historical view of minette was provided by Johannsen (1937). He wrote that the name was \\" ... used by the miners in the Vosges apparently for oolitic or granular iron ore, and possibly derived from the valley of Minkette, where it occurs....\\" Examples include minettes in the Navajo Volcanic Field (e.g. dikes near Shiprock and Mitten Rock, NM) of the Colorado PlateauRoden, M.

An obsolete name for kersantite is kersanton.  Distribution  Lamprophyres are usually associated with voluminous granodiorite intrusive episodes.Rock, N.M.S., 1991, Lamprophyres, Blackie, Glasgow, UK They occur as marginal facies to some granites, though usually as dikes and sills marginal to and crosscutting the granites and diorites.Jackson, T. A., Lewis, J. F., Scot, P. W., Manning, P. A. S., 1998, The Petrology of Lamprophyre Dykes in the Above Rocks Granitoid, Jamaica: Evidence of rifting above a subduction zone during the early Tertiary. Caribbean Journal of Science, vol. 34, no. 1-2, pp. 1-11, 1998. In other districts where granites are abundant no rocks of this class are known. It is rare to find only one member of the group present, but minettes, vogesites, kersantites, etc., all appear and there are usually transitional forms. Lamprophyres are also known to be spatially and temporally associated with gold mineralisation, for example orogenic gold deposits.M√ºller D., Groves D.I. (2019) Potassic igneous rocks and associated gold-copper mineralization (5th ed.). Mineral Resource Reviews. Springer-Verlag Heidelberg, 398 pp Rock (1991) considered lamphrophyres to be possible source rocks for the gold, but this view is not generally supported. The more reasonable explanation for the correlation is that lamprophyres, representing \\"wet\\" melts of the asthenosphere and mantle, correlate with a period of high fluid flow from the mantle through the crust, during subduction-related metamorphism, which drives gold mineralisation. Non-melilitic lamprophyres are found in many districts where granites and diorites occur, such as the Scottish Highlands and Southern Uplands of Scotland;Thorpe R.S., Gaskarth J.W. & Henney P.J., 1993.

It was owned and operated by the Public Service Railroad, a subsidiary of the Public Service Corporation of New Jersey. Before the Public Service Railroad, the line was owned by several other companies: *Trenton and New Brunswick Railroad (Trenton to Milltown) - incorporated in 1902, opened on May 13, 1904 *New Jersey Short Line Railroad (Milltown to Elizabeth), not opened until 1913 *New York ‚Äì Philadelphia Company - 1904 consolidation of the above two companies with the Camden and Trenton Railway, went bankrupt in 1908 *Elizabeth and Trenton Railroad - took over operations north of Trenton in 1910 *Public Service Railroad - created as a subsidiary of the Public Service Corporation of New Jersey, leased the Elizabeth and Trenton Railroad in 1913, opened on July 1, 1913 In Trenton, the line used trackage owned by the Trenton Terminal Railroad, a subsidiary of the Camden and Trenton Railway, a terminal railroad. This trackage began at Warren Street and State Street, and then used Warren Street, Bridge Street, Union Street, Federal Street, Lamberton Street, Cass Street, a one-way pair on Grand Street and Adeline Street, and Liberty Street onto a private right-of-way east of Olden Avenue. The line between Main Street in Milltown (south of New Brunswick) and Main Street south of Metuchen was graded by the NJ Short Line but was never completed. When the line was finished by Public Service, existing trackage through New Brunswick was used along Main Street, Milltown Road, Georges Road, private right-of-way between Mile Run Brook and the Raritan River Railroad, Commercial Avenue, Sandford Street, Throop Avenue, George Street, Albany Street, Raritan Avenue, Woodbridge Avenue, and Main Street. Existing trackage was also used from Elizabeth to Newark, on Bayway, Broad Street, Newark Avenue, Frelinghuysen Avenue, a one-way pair on Miller Street and Vanderpool Street, and Broad Street. Two branches on the line north of New Brunswick were built, one to Carteret and one towards Perth Amboy, both merging towards the north. The Carteret branch used shuttle operations, with a transfer at the junction with the mainline, but Perth Amboy trains ran all the way to Newark. On the Perth Amboy end, they used existing trackage from the end of private right-of-way along Woodbridge Avenue, East Avenue, Broad Street, private right-of-way south, west across West Avenue, and south along the east side of the CNJ line to the Woodbridge Creek bridge, then south on West Avenue and State Street, ending at Smith Street. The Newark Public Service Terminal opened on May 1, 1916, and the line was rerouted to use it via a one-way pair on Green Street and Lafayette Street, and Mulberry Street to the upper level. The line was split at New Brunswick in January 1924, with a transfer required to stay on the route. When Public Service numbered their routes, it was #15-New Brunswick-Trenton and #47-New Brunswick-Newark, with #7-Carteret and #45-Perth Amboy on the branches. The line was taken out of the Public Service Terminal on June 11, 1933. By 1927, experiments began with a rail-bus that had tires and train wheels; this was used by 1934. On January 16, 1936, trains stopped running south of New Brunswick; the line north of New Brunswick continued running until May 11, 1937. The right-of-way is now used for high-voltage power lines.

It originally aired on December 22, 1961. Opening narration Plot A uniformed U.S. Army major wakes up to find himself trapped inside a large metal cylinder, where he meets a hobo, a ballet dancer, a bagpiper, and a clown who, ironically, seems to be the one among them all who reasons the most. All of them have different theories regarding their presence here, although they admit none of them are realistic. They also have no memory of who they are, or how they became trapped, and they do not seem to have any need for food or water. The major, being the newest arrival, is the most determined to escape. He is told there is no way of either breaking through or climbing up the cylinder. Eventually, the major suggests a plan to escape: forming a tower of people, each person on the other's shoulders. However, the dancer at the top of the tower is still a few inches short of the cylinder's top, and a loud clanging sound shakes the cylinder and sends the five tumbling to the ground. Now even more determined, the major fashions a grappling hook out of loose bits of clothing and his sword. By reforming the tower, he manages to grapple onto the edge of the cylinder. As he turns to survey the area surrounding the cylinder, he tumbles to the ground outside. The clown inside the cylinder briefly bemoans the loss, admitting that the major was right after all: they're all in Hell. The scene cuts to a little girl picking up a doll from the snow, in the dress of an army major. The cylinder is a Christmas toy collection barrel for a girls' orphanage, and all five characters are nothing more than dolls. The loud clanging was the ringing of a bell, used by a woman to attract donations; she tells the girl to return the doll to the barrel. The final shot is of the five characters, now seen as dolls with painted faces and glass eyes. The ballet dancer moves to hold the hand of the major as her eyes fill with tears. Closing narration Cast * Susan Harrison as Ballerina * William Windom as Major * Murray Matheson as Clown * Kelton Garwood as Hobo * Clark Allen as Bagpiper Episode notes The episode's title is a variation on the Pirandello play Six Characters in Search of an Author. Dolls were specially crafted for the final shot that closely resembled the actors who had played the parts. Legacy The episode was reportedly an inspiration for the 1997 film Cube.

II, p. 175 (\\"T. Lartius Flavus\\"). Background The Lartii, whose nomen is also spelled Larcius and Largius, were an Etruscan family at Rome during the early years of the Republic. Their nomen is derived from the Etruscan praenomen Lars.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. II, p. 723 (\\"Lartia Gens\\").Chase, p. 129. Titus' brother, Spurius Lartius, was one of the heroes of the Republic, who defended the wooden bridge over the Tiber at the side of Horatius Cocles and Titus Herminius.Livy, ii. 10. He was twice consul, in 506 and 490 BC. Titus also held the consulship twice, in 501 and 498.Dionysius, v. 24, 25, 36, vii. 68. Career Lartius' first consulship was in 501 BC, the ninth year of the Republic. His colleague was Postumus Cominius Auruncus. During their year of office, there was a disturbance at Rome, which was attributed to the actions of a group of young Sabines. Only the previous year, the consul Spurius Cassius Viscellinus had defeated the Sabines near Cures, and for a while it appeared that the war might be rekindled. Tensions were also high because it was anticipated that war with the Latins was imminent. Octavius Mamilius, the prince of Tusculum, and son-in-law of Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, the seventh and last King of Rome, was forming an alliance amongst the thirty towns of Latium, with the aim of restoring Tarquin to the throne.Livy, ii. 18Dionysius, v. 71. In these circumstances it was decided to appoint a single magistrate, originally called the praetor maximus or magister populi, \\"master of the infantry\\", but afterwards known simply as the dictator, to oversee the defence of the city. The dictator held supreme authority in the exercise of his duties, and the people had no right to appeal from his decisions, as they could under the consuls. However, the command of the dictator was limited to a period of six months. The Senate directed the consuls to nominate a dictator, and Cominius chose his colleague, Lartius. The dictator then proceeded to nominate Spurius Cassius, who had triumphed over the Sabines the previous year, as his magister equitum, or \\"master of the horse\\".Oxford Classical Dictionary, s.v. dictator. The creation of this magistracy is said to have alarmed the Sabines, who sent envoys to Rome in order to avert war. The negotiations were unsuccessful, and war was declared, but both sides were reluctant to take the field, and no battle occurred. During the remainder of his office, Lartius held the census, negotiated with the various Latin towns in hopes of retaining some old allies and gaining new ones, and presided over the consular elections for the following year. He then laid down his office before the expiration of his term, setting a precedent for future dictators.Dionysius, v. 76, 77. Lartius held the consulship a second time in 498 BC, with Quintus Cloelius Siculus. During this year, the long anticipated war with the Latins began. The dictator Aulus Postumius Albus led the Roman forces to victory at the Battle of Lake Regillus, while the consul Lartius captured the town of Fidenae. After leaving his magistracy, Lartius is said by Dionysius to have dedicated the temple of Saturn at the foot of the Capitoline Hill.Dionysius, v. 50, 59, 60; vi. 1.Livy, ii. 21. As praefectus urbi in 494, Lartius unsuccessfully advocated measures to relieve the plebs from the burdens of debt;Broughton, vol. I, p. 14.Dionysius, vi. 40. and when the plebeians seceded from the city and encamped on Mons Sacer, Lartius was one of the envoys sent by the senate to treat with them. The embassy was successful, and resulted in the institution of the tribunes of the people. Also in 493, Lartius served as legate to the consul Cominius, his colleague in 501, at the siege of Corioli, where Gaius Marcius Coriolanus gained fame through his valour.Dionysius, vi. 81, 92.Livy, ii. 29.Plutarch, \\"The Life of Coriolanus\\", 8. Historical uncertainty An alternative tradition states that the first dictator was Manius Valerius, the son of Marcus Valerius Volusus, consul in 505 BC. However, the historian Livy believed it unlikely that a man who had not yet been consul would be appointed the first dictator, or that Manius Valerius would have been nominated in place of his father. Another tradition places the institution of the dictatorship three years later, in 498 BC, during Lartius' second consulship. In that year, Livy states that Aulus Postumius Albus was appointed dictator, and led the Roman army to victory over the Latins at the Battle of Lake Regillus. However, this battle is also placed by some authorities in 496, when Postumius was consul. In literature Lartius appears as a Roman general in William Shakespeare's play, Coriolanus, based largely on the account of Coriolanus' life given in Plutarch, although Shakespeare may also have read Livy, and perhaps Dionysius.

A number of the young male inmates were kept there until mid-2005, when they were moved to other prisons in the state. The prison has four dormitories and a medical building. The officers at Arrendale are still transitioning from one of the most violent prisons in Georgia to a general purpose women's prison. In March 2006, the prison took in 350 women prisoners from Georgia's overflowing jail system. History In 2004, the prison housed 1200 adult male inmates, mostly under the age of 25, in addition to 11 juveniles between the ages of 13 and 16. 140 of the adult inmates between the ages of 17 and 20 were declared too vulnerable to be housed with the general population. The prison had come under scrutiny for failing to ensure the safety of its youth inmates. One inmate was strangled to death in February 2004. At the prison, juvenile inmates are kept separate from the adult population, but attend education classes together. As a result of the prison's troubles, the state of Georgia decided to make Arrendale a women's prison to improve its status as the second most violent prison in the state. Arrendale is also home to the United States' first all- female fire department and the state's first inmate fire department, thanks to the Georgia Department of Corrections' (GDC) Fire Services Division. The GDC operates many fire departments throughout the state, staffed solely by inmates, who are supervised by a POST-certified GDC employee who is also trained as a firefighter. The inmate firefighter program provides protection to the largely rural communities near the prisons, as well as to other locations in Georgia during emergencies. Inmates are carefully selected and are trained and certified in accordance with Georgia law and the Georgia Firefighter Standards and Training Council, as with any regular fire department. In 2007, inmate fire squads responded to the wildfires in South Georgia, in addition to the hundreds of other alarms they received statewide. The older original part of the prison was built in 1909 as a TB Hospital and operated till the mid-1950s when it was turned over to the Georgia Prison system. Specifically used as a prison for youthful offenders ages 18-25, the prison was known in the 1960s and 1970s when it had a high school rated football team and marching band. The football team was mostly undefeated until all local high schools refused to play them and lobbied the Georgia Department of Education to make them disband. At the same time Warden E. B. Caldwell made it mandatory that all inmates obtain a GED diploma and enroll in one of the on site Vocational Schools that were started under the administration of Warden Walter Matthews. The prison was named after Lee Arrendale, former Chairman of the Georgia Board of Corrections after he and his wife were killed in a plane crash.

Remarkably prolific, he worked out of Los Angeles, and was known for his love of science fiction and expensive cars, but mostly for his unmistakable style of architecture, which helped define the look of mid-20th century America. Personal life Pereira was born in Chicago, Illinois, the son of Sarah (Friedberg) and Saul Pereira.https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:Q23M-ZD96 His paternal grandfather was of Portuguese Sephardi Jewish ancestry,William L Pereira at (www.everyculture.com/) Portuguese Americans and his other grandparents were Ashkenazi Jews. Pereira graduated from the School of Architecture, University of Illinois and began his career in his home city. He had some of his earliest architectural experience helping to draft the master plan for the 1933 \\"A Century of Progress\\" Chicago World's Fair. With his brother, Hal Pereira, he designed the Esquire Theater at 58 East Oak Street, considered one of Chicago's best examples of Art Deco style. Transamerica Pyramid, San Francisco, 1972 He had two wives, former model and actress Margaret McConnell (1910-2011, married June 24, 1934) and Bronya Galef; the latter marriage ending with his death. He has a son, William Pereira, Jr., and a daughter, Monica Pereira, a Spanish teacher. William Pereira died of cancer at age 76 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. At his request, no funeral services were planned. Career In the 1930s, he and Hal moved to Los Angeles. After working as a solo architect, Pereira was hired by the Motion Picture Relief Fund and designed the first buildings for the Motion Picture Country House in Woodland Hills, California, which was dedicated September 27, 1942. Pereira also had a brief stint as a Hollywood art director. He shared an Academy Award for Best Special Effects for the action/adventure film Reap the Wild Wind (1942). He was the art director for \\"This Gun for Hire\\", Alan Ladd's first film. He was production designer of the drama Jane Eyre (1943), and of the war drama Since You Went Away (1944). Pereira was also the producer of the noir crime/drama Johnny Angel (1945), and of the Joan Fontaine drama From This Day Forward (1946). Though his buildings were often quite stark and sterile in their appearance (owing largely to the science fiction of the era), they were noted for their functional style with a certain flair that made them unmistakable. He took pride in the concept of designing for the future. In 1949, Pereira became a professor of architecture at the University of Southern California. He then formed a partnership with fellow architect and classmate, Charles Luckman, in the early 1950s. The firm, Pereira & Luckman, grew into one of the nation's busiest. The duo designed some of Los Angeles's most well- known buildings, including the famed \\"Theme Building\\" at Los Angeles International Airport (in collaboration with Paul Williams and Welton Becket). The library at University of California, Irvine, illustrating Pereira's paneled facade system He parted with Luckman in 1959. Afterward, he formed the third and final company of his career, \\"William L. Pereira & Associates.\\" In the 1960s and 1970s, he and his team completed over 250 projects, including drawing up the master plans for the Los Angeles International Airport expansion and developing the master plan for the 93,000 acre (376 km2) city of Irvine, California, which put his photograph on the cover of Time Magazine in September 1963. He later worked with Ian McHarg on the plan for the new town of The Woodlands, Texas. Pereira's buildings were easily identified by their unmistakable style, often taking unusual forms such as pyramids and ziggurats. They usually projected a grand presence, heavyset in appearance and often sitting atop \\"pedestals\\" that were themselves an integral part of the building. Many of his buildings were complemented by water features and some were almost entirely surrounded by water. The Los Angeles County Museum of Art, for instance, was a complex of three Googie-esque buildings rising up out of a lake and interconnected by a series of causeways and bridges. Pereira designed the campus plans of the University of Southern California, the University of California, Irvine, and Pepperdine University. His material of choice in creating his unique geometric forms was pre-cast concrete. Working in this medium, he could create his impressive facades by simply attaching them as panels on to the steel frame of the building. Legacy By the time of his death, Pereira had over 400 projects to his name. Among the structures he designed throughout Southern California were CBS Television City, Fox Plaza, the Los Angeles County Art Museum, the Howard Johnson Hotel and Water Playground in Anaheim, and the Disneyland Hotel in Anaheim. He is also responsible for creating the monumental Spanish-inspired facades that defined Robinson's department stores for nearly 20 years, and he was the architect of Pepperdine University at Malibu, named by the Princeton Review as the most beautiful college campus in America. Out of his immense body of work, three have really stood out in the public mind: the master-planned cities of Irvine and Newport Beach, and the Transamerica Pyramid in San Francisco. His most praised and criticized work was probably the Transamerica building, which was completed in 1972. It was first panned as an intrusion on the city's skyline, but has been accepted as having more character than the buildings around it and as being an oddly creative city symbol. Perhaps his greatest lasting legacy besides his buildings are the numerous respected architects of today who came out of both Pereira's firm and the classes he taught at USC, including Gin Wong, William Blurock, and Frank Gehry. Pereira's firm was taken over upon his death by his two primary cohorts, Scott Johnson and Bill Fain.

The new extension at Dagstuhl. The chapel at Schloss Dagstuhl. Dagstuhl is a computer science research center in Germany, located in and named after a district of the town of Wadern, Merzig- Wadern, Saarland. Location Following the model of the mathematical center at Oberwolfach, the center is installed in a very remote and relaxed location in the countryside. The Leibniz Center is located in a historic country house, Schloss Dagstuhl (Dagstuhl Castle), together with modern purpose-built buildings connected by an enclosed footbridge.Schloss Dagstuhl, Sightseeing with Google Satellite Maps. The ruins of the 13th-century Dagstuhl Castle are nearby, a short walk up a hill from the Schloss. Center The Leibniz- Zentrum f√ºr Informatik (LZI, Leibniz Center for Informatics) was established at Dagstuhl in 1990. The center is managed as a non-profit organization, and financed by national funds. It receives scientific support by a variety of German and foreign research institutions. Until April 2008 the name of the center was: International Conference and Research Center for Computer Science (German: Internationales Begegnungs- und Forschungszentrum f√ºr Informatik (IBFI)). The center was founded by Reinhard Wilhelm, who continued as its director until May 2014, when Raimund Seidel became the director.. Library Dagstuhl's computer science library has over 50,000 books and other media, among them a full set of Springer-Verlag's Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series and electronic access to many computer science journals.Dagstuhl Library, Schloss Dagstuhl, Germany. Seminar series Dagstuhl supports computer science by organizing high ranked seminars on hot topics in informatics. Dagstuhl Seminars, which are established after review and approval by the Scientific Directorate, bring together personally invited scientists from academia and industry from all over the world to discuss their newest ideas and problems.Dagstuhl Seminar Proceedings, DBLP. Apart from the Dagstuhl seminars, the center also hosts summer schools, group retreats, and other scientific events, all discussing informatics. Every year about 3,500 scientists stay in Dagstuhl for about 100 seminars, workshops and other scientific events. The number of participants is limited to enable discussion and by the available housing capacity. The stay is full-board; participants are accommodated in the original house or in the modern annex, and have all their meals at the center. Seminars are usually held for a weekly period: participants arrive on Sunday evening and depart on Friday evening or Saturday morning. One or sometimes two seminars are held simultaneously with other small meetings. The cryptographic technique DP5 (Dagstuhl Privacy Preserving Presence Protocol P) is named after Schloss Dagstuhl. Publications As well as publishing proceedings from its own seminars, the Leibniz Center publishes the Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs),LIPics: Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics, retrieved 2011-09-11. a series of open access conference proceedings from computer science conferences worldwide.

(A general guide for rescue vehicles: water tender) (In Finnish). Ministry of the Interior, Finland. Retrieved on April the 28th, 2007 Water tenders are capable of drafting water from a stream, lake or hydrant. This class of apparatus does not necessarily have enough pumping capacity to power large hose lines (like a fire engine), though it utilizes a smaller pump to draft from bodies of water. Water tenders are used when there is no working fire hydrant within reach of other fire equipment, potentially supplying the fire engine(s) with a very rapid connection.

National Fire Protection Association. Typically water tenders support engines and/or trucks like aerials during fires and hazardous material incidents. Some water tenders carry fire fighting equipment and crew much like an engine. These water tenders are able to operate relatively independently. Some water tenders actually combine a fire engine and water tender. This kind of unit may have seats for up to six firefighters, a water tank of more than , and basic equipment for firefighting and rescue.Pelastustieto (in Finnish) This configuration may be found, for example, in rural areas, where a fire engine (with rescue equipment) and water tender are supported by a combined fire engine/water tender unit in overlapping fires or accidents. Numerous wildland water tenders have remotely controlled nozzles mounted on the front bumper to allow them to drive alongside a fire or smoldering area and efficiently wet it down without the crew leaving the rig. Very light water tenders are sometimes used in wildfires. For example, a small tank of can be carried by a cross- country vehicle to extinguish smoldering stubs on rough terrain. A water tender typically carries some fire fighting equipment. There are various national standards and recommendations on equipment to be carried on water tenders.NFPA 1901 Standard for Automotive Fire Apparatus, Chapter 7: Mobile Water Supply Fire Apparatus. 2003 edition. National Fire Protection Association. Some water tenders may carry various kinds of hoses and spray nozzles for use in forest, building, or industrial fires, as well as a portable water tank. In addition, tools like axes, flashlights, fire extinguishers, a self-contained breathing apparatus, a first aid kit, adapters, and a hydrant wrench may be required. Some tenders carry also foaming agents, and extinguishing powders or gases. Examples of specialised water tenders include airport crash tenders and wildland water tenders. An Australian Water Tender can range from a standard fire engine, with a larger- than-usual capacity (usually called a tanker), to a Water Tender equipped with specialty equipment such as fixed monitors and long-throw foam nozzles (usually called a Bulk Water Carrier). Several areas also own converted semi- trailer fuel tankers, capable of holding many thousands of litres of petrol, foam or other retardant. These are most often used in severe HazMat situations, such as oil refinery fires or fuel tanker accidents, where a large and continuous volume of water is needed.

Fort McCoy is a United States Army installation on between Sparta and Tomah, Wisconsin, in Monroe County. In 1909, there were two separate camps named Camp Emory Upton and Camp Robinson; in 1926, these camps were joined together to form Camp McCoy.Since its creation in 1909, the post has been used primarily as a military training center. A part of Fort McCoy is also used by the Wisconsin State Patrol as a training facility. Wisconsin State Patrol Facilities History The post has been in virtually constant use since it was first formed as the \\"Sparta Maneuver Tract\\" on 14,000 acres (57 km2) in 1909. At first, the tract was made up of two camps, Camp Emory Upton and Camp Robinson. These were separated by a line of the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad that ran across the land from east to west. In 1910, the army renamed the entire tract \\"Camp Bruce Elisha McCoy\\" for the father (a Civil War captain) of Robert Bruce McCoy, a retired major general who first proposed the area as a training ground and bought part of the property on which the fort stands. In 1926, the name of the post was officially renamed \\"Camp McCoy\\" in honor of Robert Bruce McCoy, who had died in January of that year. It has gone by many different names such as Sparta Maneuver Tract; Sparta Military Reservation; Camp McCoy; and now the present, Fort McCoy.The name McCoy comes from Robert B. McCoy who was a military man, farmer and served as county judge who initially set up the land as a military camp. In 1938, the United States began a major expansion of the camp. This included the addition of over 45,000 acres (180 km2) to the post, as well as the construction of several new structures, including living quarters for the troops. This increased the camp's capacity to 35,000 soldiers. In all, the project was estimated to have cost about $30 million. The expansion was officially concluded with a new inauguration on August 30, 1942. During World War II, Fort McCoy was used as a concentration camp for approximately 170 Japanese and 120 German and Italian American civilians arrested as potentially dangerous \\"enemy aliens\\" in 1942.\\"Camp McCoy\\" Densho Encyclopedia (accessed 11 June 2014) After the internees were transferred to other camps, McCoy was used as a training facility for units from across the country preparing to enter combat, including the segregated all-Nisei 100th Infantry Battalion.J. Burton, M. Farrell, F. Lord, R. Lord. Confinement and Ethnicity: An Overview of World War II Japanese American Relocation Sites, \\"Department of Justice and U.S. Army Facilities\\" , Ch. 17 (National Park Service) The post was also used as a prisoner-of-war (POW) camp during the conflict, holding 4,000 Japanese and German POWs. Fort McCoy's POWs were featured in the 2011 film Fort McCoy. The camp was briefly deactivated following World War II, but with the advent of the Korean War in 1950, it was once again used for training. This continued until 1953, when the camp was again deactivated. It was then used to house various small national, state and civilian projects, and served as a training center for the Army Reserves, the National Guard, and the Job Corps. In 1973, the Army reactivated Camp McCoy as a permanent training center, and on September 30, 1974, it was officially re-designated as Fort McCoy. In the 1990s, a second major construction project was undertaken, costing about $140 million. Today, Fort McCoy serves as a Total Force Training Center. More than 100,000 members of the military are trained at the fort every year,Fort McCoy Facts & Figures 2005 and the total number has exceeded 149,000 in the past.history The 181st Infantry Brigade is the largest unit stationed at Fort McCoy. The brigade is responsible for training selected U.S. Army Reserve and Army National Guard units in the Central-Northern United States to support contingency operations in the Global War on Terror.

This was the first time units had mobilized at Fort McCoy since the Korean War. Seventy-four military units deployed through Fort McCoy, totaling more than 9,000 Soldiers, 8% of the reserve forces activated during the Persian Gulf War. Volk Field Air National Guard Base was used as the primary point of departure. In addition, more than 3,000 pieces of equipment were deployed from Fort McCoy by train. The 769th Engineer Battalion and the 927th Engineer Company (Sapper) of the 225th Engineer Brigade of the Louisiana Army National Guard mobilized for deployments to both Iraq and Afghanistan in 2008 and 2009. The 890th Engineer Battalion of the Mississippi Army National Guard conducted Mobilization training at McCoy from April to June 2008 before deploying to Iraq. The 194th Engineer Brigade mobilized from Fort McCoy to Iraq in 2009 and 190th Engineer Company mobilized to Afghanistan from there in 2010, both are part of the Tennessee Army National Guard.

About 3,000 German, 2,700 Japanese, and 500 Korean prisoners of war were held there. There were many other places that these prisoners were housed. President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an executive order titled Order 9066 that brought these prisoners into the different states and away from the coasts. The first Japanese prisoner of war to enter the camp was captured at Pearl Harbor. There were five different POW compounds at Fort McCoy. There were two for the Japanese, another two for the Germans, and one for the Koreans. There were two barracks in each compound consisting of 50 bunk bedsThis is where they would sleep, spend time with one another and write home if they wanted. Japanese POWs were served steamed rice, usually once a day, and they were offered soy sauce with all their meals. Their utensils were replaced with chopsticks. Prisoners at Fort McCoy were fed well compared to other camps that were criticized for how they treated Japanese POWs Health was important factor to Fort McCoy. They had an on-site hospital that POWs could use if they were ill and had access to prescription medicines and the camp dentist. They were allowed to practice religion freely. Japanese POWs were given a chapel which was converted to a place of worship. Buddhist preachings were performed daily and in order to perform them prisoners needed incense. They did not have incense so they asked the YMCA for it and it was granted to them.

It is similar to other 4 State barcode systems used by Australia Post and the United Kingdom's Royal Mail (from which it derives), but uses an obscured structure and encoding system unique to Canada Post. This particular bar code system is used on \\"flats\\" (which are larger-than-letter-size pieces of mail, such as magazines) and parcels. This symbology, derived from the RM4SCC system used by the British Royal Mail, uses a series of bars, each of which can individually have one of four possible states, to encode information used in automated sortation and delivery onto each piece of mail. Each bar can either be short and centred (known as a tracker), medium and elevated (an ascender), medium and lowered (a descender), or full height. This symbology also uses an element known as a Data Content Identifier (or DCI), which specifies what types of information are encoded into each barcode, such as postal codes, customer information, and exact delivery points. The information that goes into each barcode is obtained from the address printed on the front of the envelope it is ultimately printed on, as well as the physical dimensions of each piece of mail. This code also uses a Reed-Solomon error correction technique, so that in case a particular piece of mail is mishandled, the information encoded in the barcode can still be correctly decoded. Character sets Chart of PostBar characters Four character sets are used in PostBar codes, known as \\"A\\", \\"N\\", \\"Z\\" and \\"B\\" characters. Three-bar A characters are used exclusively to encode letters, and two-bar N characters encode only digits. Three-bar Z characters can encode either letters or digits. A and N characters are typically used to encode postal codes and country codes. Z characters are used for address locators, product types, and customer and service information. B characters are one bar each, and are used to encode base-4 machine IDs for Canada Post's internal uses. The bars making up a character can be interpreted as base-3 digits. A full height bar encodes 0, a short lower bar (an ascender) encodes 1, and a short upper bar (a descender) encodes 2. The leftmost bar in a group is the most significant trit, and may have the value 3, with both upper and lower bars short (a tracker). In other words, short upper and lower bars are assigned weights of 18 & 9, 6 & 3, and 2 & 1, from left to right. Since the first bar has 4 possible values, and the following bars have 3, 2 bars can encode 4√ó3 = 12 values, while 3 bars can encode 4√ó3√ó3 = 36. N characters are simply encoded as the values 0‚Äì9. Only the value 9 requires a leading 3. Z characters use the full 36 combinations representable by 3 bars. The values 0‚Äì25 encode the letters A‚ÄìZ, and 26‚Äì35 encode the digits 0‚Äì9. A characters have a somewhat peculiar encoding. They can also be decoded as three base-3 digits (a leading 3 is never used), with the values 2‚Äì26 mostly encoding A‚ÄìY. Exceptions are that 0 encodes M, 1 encodes H, 9 encodes Z (rather than H), and code 14 is not used (rather than encoding M). PostBar formats Canada Post uses nine different formats of PostBar codes--three \\"domestic\\" barcodes, used on mail within Canada, two \\"global\\" codes, used to route mail outside Canada, three \\"service\\" codes, used on customer-applied barcodes, and an \\"internal\\" code, used for testing, maintenance, and tracking purposes by Canada Post. Each barcode begins and ends with an identical pair of bars, known as \\"start\\" and \\"stop\\" fields. These are made up of one ascender and one tracker. The Data Content Identifier is always the first character after the start field. Placeholders used to detail each PostBar format below are A, N, Z and B for the character sets described above, * for the start and stop fields, # for a space character (two full-height bars followed by one tracker), and [RS-nn] for the error-correction field, where nn is the number of bars used. Bold Z's indicate DCIs. =Domestic= See caution at bottom of article regarding use of PostBar codes.

As of 2013 or earlier the previous BRM barcode, which were Code 93-type barcodes, were deemed non-machineable. An extended 73 bar long BRM barcode 'C73' , scheduled for availability from 2011, was indefinitely postponed. Caveat Lector The PostBar barcode dimensions, formats, and symbology examples in Canada Post 4-State Bar Code Handbook and as actually implemented by Canada Post are significantly different from the formats and symbology described in this article and in . Example of the D12 PostBar format as given in U.S. Patent 5,602,382. For PostBar format D12, as described in this article and shown here, the Postal Code is encoded using fifteen bars and the 'A' and 'N' character sets. The Address Locater encodes four alphanumerics using twelve bars and the 'Z' characters set. This format also includes a space character and twelve bars for Reed-Solomon error correction for a total count of forty nine bars. Example of the D52.01 PostBar format as given in Canada Post's 4-State Bar Code HandbookOn the other hand, PostBar format D52.01, as described in and shown here, encodes the Postal Code using only twelve bars and an unknown symbology. It encodes nine alphanumerics in the Address Locater field using twenty one bars and another unknown symbology. It does not include any fields for space characters, but it does include twelve bars for Reed-Solomon error correction for a total count of fifty two bars. Most significantly these two different formats use exactly the same code for their Data Content Identifier field; specifically two Full Height bars and an Ascender (Image:PostBar B Z.png) which corresponds to a 'B' character using the 'Z' symbology. From samples of mail being delivered by Canada Post, the D52.01 format with an unknown symbology is the implemented standard, and not format D12 as described in this article. Postal customers who attempt to include a D12 formatted PostBar code, or any other PostBar format or symbology as described in this article may find it is misinterpreted by Canada Post's sorting machinery. This could possibly delay or even prevent their mail being delivered.

They wrote several programs to transform the faces, store them and serve them on several machines at the lab. As time went by they added faces from outside their Center and outside Bell Labs. This database also led to the pico image editor (originally named zunk) which was used for image transformations, many of them with colleagues as the preferred target.PJW's Face The first programs built around vismon were used to announce incoming mail in a dedicated window, using the 48 by 48 pixel faces. Later on the faces were also used to decorate line printer banners. References Notes *Pike, Rob and Presotto, Dave. \\"Face the Nation\\". USENIX Summer 1985 Conference Proceedings.

History =Creation= St. Andrews is Ottawa's oldest Protestant Presbyterian Church in Canada congregation. Nicholas Sparks donated land in 1827, which permitted the construction and opening in 1828 of the St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church.[\\"Ottawa--making a Capital\\"edited by Jeff Keshen, Nicole J. M. St-Onge, Ottawa: University of Ottawa Press] The church was founded for, and built by, the Scottish and Irish labourers who were constructing the Rideau Canal for Montreal's John Redpath and their own Thomas MacKay. The location on Wellington Street was purchased for 200 pounds sterling and the church was built during lulls in the construction of the canal. As Ottawa had no Anglican church at the time, St. Andrew's argued that it should be considered the established church in the city, as the representative of the Established Church of Scotland. The advantage of being so recognized, was the rights to clergy reserves. The authorities agreed to the request, and in 1837 the church was granted a large glebe to the south of the city. This area stretching from Bronson Avenue to the Rideau Canal later became the neighbourhood known as the Glebe. In the 1840s a stone manse was built where the Sunday School Hall later stood. The minister of St. Andrews was the Rev. Alexander McKidd, M.A., from 1844 to July 1846.Ottawa Past and Present - 1927 by A. H. D. Ross, M.A., M.F.

Ross, M.A., M.F. The building was replaced with the current structure in 1872. The commission for St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church on Wellington Street at Kent Street was awarded to William Tutin Thomas of Montreal in 1872-74. William Tutin Thomas =Growth= In June 1875, St. Andrew's, Knox, Bank Street (later Chalmers), the newly formed congregations in New Edinburgh (now MacKay United Church, named after their first Elder and Trustee Thomas MacKay), and in the Sandy Hill (or Lower Town) St. Paul's or Daly Street, and congregations in nearby Rochesterville (Erskine), Hull, Quebec, Cumberland, Manotick, Nepean (Merivale, and Bells Corners), that all became part of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, within the Presbytery of Ottawa. On the 7 August 1883, the Rev. W. T. Herridge, D.D., was inducted. The Dominion of Canada Rifle Association erected a plaque in 1906 which is dedicated to Lt Colonel John MacPherson (1830-1906), who served as its treasurer for 36 years. =Great War= In 1913, the Rev. A. M. Gordon was Assistant Minister; in 1914 he went overseas with the first Canadian Contingent and served with distinction throughout the First World War. The Ottawa Branch of the 21st Battalion Association erected a memorial plaque which is dedicated to Brigadier General William St Pierre Hughes, D.S.O., V.D., First Commanding Officer 21st Battalion (Eastern Ontario), CEF 1914 - 1916. In 1919, Dr. R.T. Herridge retired and he was appointed Minister Emeritus.Ottawa Past and Present - 1927 by A. H. D. Ross, M.A., M.F. Erected by his wife and children, a memorial plaque at St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church (Ottawa) is dedicated to Major General James Lyons Biggar, C.M.G., Quartermaster General of Canada in 1917 during the Great War. A memorial stained glass window is dedicated to members of the church who gave their lives in the Great War: \\"They overcame and they loved not their lives unto the death 1914 - 1918\\" Members of the Overseas C.A.M.C. Nursing Service erected a memorial plaque which is dedicated to Matron Margaret H. Smith, R.R.C. & Bar, veteran of the South African War and the Great War. The Rev. George Kilpatrick, B.D., who served overseas during the Great War with distinction, was Minister from 1920 until June 1925.Ottawa Past and Present - 1927 by A. H. D. Ross, M.A., M.F. In 1925, this congregation voted 389-309 to remain in the Presbyterian Church in Canada rather than join the United Church of Canada. A number of families, and the Minister, went to nearby Chalmers; only Knox and Erskine (closed October 2007, and amalgamated with Westminster), within the then City of Ottawa remained as \\"continuing\\" Presbyterians. =Between the wars= After 1925, the Presbyterian presence in Ottawa was far smaller. St Andrew's, Knox and Erskine were involved with citywide ministries. A church school in the Hintonburg neighbourhood (the former Bethany Presbyterian Church became Parkdale United) became St. Stephen's Church in 1945, while \\"minority\\" groups formed St. Giles in The Glebe, Westminster in Westboro, South Gloucester and Knox Church, Manotick. =Second World War= Princess Juliana of the Netherlands erected a wooden lectern and brass plaque, which is dedicated in thanks to the church for their hospitality during Princess Juliana's residence in Ottawa during the Second World War. A memorial plaque is dedicated to members of the church who died or served during the Second World War: \\"To you from falling hands we throw the torch; be yours to hold it high\\" John McCrae. =Rebuilding= Following the 1950 annexation by Ottawa of parts of Nepean and Gloucester Townships, St. Andrew's was very supportive of Presbyterian church extension into these new residential neighbourhoods. Under the leadership of Rev. Dr. John A. Johnston, (1927‚Äì2008) late father of Andrew Johnston (Senior Minister 1999-2013), four new congregations were started after his appointment in 1956; St Timothy's on Alta Vista Drive, a new St. Paul's, located on Woodroffe Avenue, St. Martin's in Manor Park, and St. David's in Overbrook. The latter two merged in 1967, and later extension projects included Parkwood, in Nepean, Trinity in Kanata, Grace in Orleans, and Greenview (closed June 30, 2007) in Barrhaven. =Since the 1970s= With the changing demographics in Ottawa, there were other changes in the area adjacent to the congregation. In the 1970s, it was decided to lease the land to the rear of the church. The Sunday school building that had been built in 1874 was torn down (there was a fire) and an office building, St. Andrew's Tower, was built in its place in 1988. This building, which is attached directly to the rear of the church, is now the headquarters of the Department of Justice, although the congregation has offices, and rooms on the lower levels, entered from Kent Street, with wheelchair access from the Tower Building. A number of dignitaries have attended the church. It was where Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King worshipped when in Ottawa. Governors General included the Earl of Aberdeen, and Lord Tweedsmuir, also known as author John Buchan, whose February 1940 funeral was held within the sanctuary. Princess Margriet of the Netherlands was baptized here, while the royal family was in exile during the Second World War, and a lectern was later donated by the family, featuring the Dutch Royal Coat of Arms. In September 2003, the congregation celebrated its 175th anniversary. A new history, Unto the Hills Around by John S. Moir, was published for this occasion. This book was awarded the T. Melville Bailey Memorial Award by the Presbyterian Church in Canada's Committee on History in June 2005. Ministers The Senior Minister of St. Andrew's is the Reverend Dr. Karen Dimock. Born in Scotland, Reverend Dimock moved to Jamaica at an early age before arriving in the Hamilton, Ontario area at age four. She studied sciences and received a PhD in Neuroscience from McGill University before entering the ministry. Reverend Dimock has been the Minister at St Andrew's since November 2014. Since 1828, fourteen ministers have served this congregation along with a number of associates, assistants, deaconesses, pastoral care, and student ministers. All but six of these senior ministers were born in Scotland. Two ministers, Rev. Dr. William T. Herridge (1914), and Minister Emeritus Rev. Dr. Arthur W. Currie (1981), held the Office of Moderator of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in Canada while serving as Minister of St. Andrew's. Rev. Dr. Daniel Miner Gordon (1896) was moderator after his tenure (1867‚Äì1882) in Ottawa, and before he became Principal of Queen's University. The General Assembly moderated by Dr. Currie was also held in Ottawa, in Knox, and at Tabaret Hall in the University of Ottawa. St Andrew's has hosted the Presbyterian General Assembly in 1879 1901, 1910, 1929, 1951, and 1997, and before 1875, the Church of Scotland Synod in 1859 and 1874. =List of Ministers= *John Cruickshank (1829‚Äì1843), *Alexander MacKid (1844‚Äì1846), *William Durie + (1846‚Äì1847), *Alexander Spence (1848‚Äì1867), *Daniel Miner Gordon (1867‚Äì1882), *William T.

Pakula. Set in the American West of the 1940s but not a typical Western, it tells the story of two ranchers (Caan and Fonda) whose small operation is threatened both by economic hardship and the expansionist dreams of a local land baron (Robards). Farnsworth, a former stuntman, received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance. The film grossed $9.6 million at the box office. A stuntman working on this film, Jim Sheppard, was killed while doing a scene where Robards' character is dragged to (presumably) his death. A horse dragging him veered from its course and caused Sheppard to hit his head on a fence post. The scene made it into the movie, but it is cut right before the horse passes through the gate where the fatal accident occurred. Plot It's the 1940s, near the end of World War II in the American West. The setting is a large, fertile valley ideal for raising cattle. Rancher Jacob W. Ewing's (Jason Robards) family has lived in the valley for generations, and his dream is to control all of it and preserve it from those - farmers and oilmen, for example - who would use the land for other purposes. Visiting J.W. is wealthy oil executive Neil Atkinson, whose late father was J.W.'s good friend and financial backer; the Atkinsons helped J.W. buy out neighboring ranchers, taking advantage of their financial problems (often with some \\"persuasion\\" from J.W.'s henchmen). The one remaining holdout is Ella Connors (Jane Fonda), whose family has ranched in the area for the last two generations and who relies on the family's aging but skillful cowhand Dodger (Richard Farnsworth). Another small player is war veteran Frank Athearn (James Caan) to whom Ella has sold a small plot of land to pay her bills. Ella and J.W. have some personal history which Ella prefers to put behind her, but which J.W. keeps bringing up. Although J.W. believes that Ella cannot survive another season financially, Ella and Frank, both of whom are committed to making a living ranching, enter into an uneasy alliance, especially after a dangerous incident precipitated by J.W. involving Frank and Frank's partner, fellow veteran Billy Joe Meynart (Mark Harmon). Neil, meanwhile, wants to explore the entire valley for oil, and uses his family's financial support to pressure J.W. into agreeing. Ella, Frank, and Neil soon discover that J.W. will go to any lengths to get what he wants.IMDb Cast *James Caan as Frank \\"Buck\\" Athearn *Jane Fonda as Ella Connors *Jason Robards as Jacob \\"J.W.\\" Ewing *George Grizzard as Neil Atkinson *Richard Farnsworth as Dodger *Jim Davis as Julie Blocker *Mark Harmon as Billy Joe Meynert *Macon McCalman as Virgil Hoverton *Basil Hoffman as George Bascomb *James Kline as Ralph Cole *James Keach as Emil Kroegh Production The film was based on an original script Comes a Horseman Wild and Free.MR.

He divides his time between his professorship in biology at the University of Pennsylvania, where he is the DiMaura Professor of Conservation Biology, and his research and field work in Costa Rica. Janzen and his wife Winifred Hallwachs have catalogued the biodiversity of Costa Rica. Through a DNA barcoding initiative with geneticist Paul Hebert, they have registered over 500,000 specimens representing more than 45,000 species, which has led to the identification of cryptic species of near-identical appearance that differ in terms of genetics and ecological niche. They helped to establish the Area de Conservaci√≥n Guanacaste World Heritage Site, one of the oldest, largest and most successful habitat restoration projects in the world.  Early life and education Daniel Hunt Janzen was born January 18, 1939 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. His father, Daniel Hugo Janzen, grew up in a Mennonite farming community and served as Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. His father and mother, Miss Floyd Clark Foster of Greenville, South Carolina, were married on April 29, 1937. Janzen obtained his B.Sc. degree in biology from the University of Minnesota, in 1961, and his Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley in 1965. Career  In 1963, Janzen attended a two-month course in tropical biology taught in several field sites throughout Costa Rica. This Advanced Science Seminar in Tropical Biology was the precursor to a Fundamentals in Tropical Biology course, which Janzen designed for the Organization for Tropical Studies (OTS), a consortium of several North American and Costa Rican universities. Janzen went back in 1965 as an instructor and has lectured in at least one of the three yearly courses every year since. Janzen taught at the University of Kansas (1965‚Äì1968), the University of Chicago (1969‚Äì1972) and at the University of Michigan (1972‚Äì1976) before joining the faculty at the University of Pennsylvania. There he is the DiMaura Professor of Conservation Biology, and his research and field work in Costa Rica. Janzen has also held teaching positions in Venezuela (Universidad de Oriente, Cuman√° in 1965-66; Universidad de los Los Andes, M√©rida in 1973), and in Puerto Rico (Universidad de Puerto Rico, R√≠o Piedras, 1969). Research Janzen's early work focused on the careful and meticulous documentation of species in Costa Rica, and in particular on ecological processes and the dynamics and evolution of animal-plant interactions. In 1967, for example he described the phenological specialization of bee-pollinated species of Bignoniaceae,Janzen, D. H. 1967. Synchronization of sexual reproduction of trees within the dry season in Central America. Evolution 21: 620-637. amongst them a \\"kind of mass flowering\\", which Alwyn Howard Gentry in his classification of flowering named Type 4 or \\"big bang\\" strategy.Alwyn H. Gentry.

Biotropica 6(1): 64-68 1974 Miguel Altieri in his textbook Agroecology: The Science of Sustainable Agriculture says: \\"Janzen's 1973 article on tropical agroecosystems was the first widely read evaluation of why tropical agricultural systems might function differently from those of the temperate zones\\". In 1985, realizing that the area in which they worked was threatened, Janzen and Hallwachs expanded the focus of their work to include tropical forest restoration, expansion (through land purchases) and conservation. Through a DNA barcoding initiative with geneticist Paul Hebert, they have registered over 500,000 specimens representing more than 45,000 species, which has led to the identification of cryptic species of near-identical appearance that differ in terms of genetics and ecological niche. Janzen and Hallwachs have supported species barcoding initiatives at both national and international levels through the Instituto Nacional de Biodiversidad (INBio), CBOL (Consortium for the Barcode of Life) and iBOL (International Barcode of Life). =Coevolution of plants and animals= * Coevolution of a mutualistic system in New World tropics between species of Acacia (Mimosoideae; Leguminosae), v. gr., Acacia cornigera, and the ant Pseudomyrmex ferruginea (Formicidae). Acacia spp in the Neotropics are protected by ants against defoliation; for this, the ants are rewarded by means of special organs and physiology that Acacia has evolved. * Spondias mombin (Anacardiaceae) lost its megafauna seed dispersers in the Pleistocene. Between fire in open pastures and seed predation by bruchid beetles in closed- canopy forest, S. mombin does not stand a chance. But, today, in Guanacaste, seeds are dispersed by White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and some 15 other mammals, that feed mostly in forest edges, where bruchids are less likely to find the seeds and fires are not so frequent. =Tropical habitat restoration= Tropical dry forests are the world's most threatened forest ecosystems. In middle America there were 550 000 km¬≤ of dry forests at the beginning of the 16th century; today, less than 0.08% (440 km¬≤ ) remains. They have been cleared, burnt and replaced by pastures for cattle raising, at an ever-faster rate during the last 500 years. In 1985, realizing that widespread development in northwestern Costa Rica was rapidly decimating the forest in which they conducted their research, Janzen and Hallwachs expanded the focus of their work. They began with the Parque Nacional Santa Rosa, which included of pasture and relictual neotropical dry forest and of marine habitat. This eventually became the √Årea de Conservaci√≥n Guanacaste (ACG), located just south of the Costa Rica-Nicaragua border, between the Pacific Ocean and the Cordillera de Tilaran which integrated four different national parks. Together these house at least 15 different biotopes, viz (mangroves, dry forest and shrubs, ephemeral, rainy season, and permanent streams, fresh water and littoral swamps, evergreen rain- and cloud forests‚Ä¶) and ca. 4% from world's plant, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fishes and insects diversity, all within an area less than . It is one of the oldest, largest and most successful habitat restoration projects in the world. As of 2019, it consists of . The park exemplifies their beliefs about how a park should be run. It is known as a center of biological research, forest restoration and community outreach. Janzen and his wife helped to establish the Area de Conservaci√≥n Guanacaste World Heritage Site, one of the oldest, largest and most successful habitat restoration projects in the world. As of 2019, it consists of , located just south of the Costa Rica-Nicaragua border, between the Pacific Ocean and the Cordillera de Tilaran. The park exemplifies their beliefs about how a park should be run. It is known as a center of biological research, forest restoration and community outreach. Habitat restoration is not a simple matter. Not only must one fight against hundreds of years of ecological degradation, manifested in the form of altered drainage patterns, hard to eradicate pastures, compacted soils, exhausted seed banks, diminished adult and propagule stocks, proliferation of fire-resistant and unpalatable weeds from the old world tropics and sub-tropics. Also one is faced with the difficulties of changing a culture which coevolved with, profited from and can become miserable with such a system. For this reason ACG was conceived as a cultural restoration project, which, to paraphrase its natural counterpart, ought to be grown as well. ACG integrates complementary processes of experimentation, habitat restoration and cultural development. The techniques used include: * Active restoration, artificial dispersal of propagules from plant species native to the Guanacaste habitats * Passive restoration by means of fire, anti-poaching and herbivore control * Ecological education and sensibilisation Personal life Of his research partner and wife, Winifred Hallwachs, Janzen says \\"We did these things together,\\" and \\"we are very much together in perceiving things the same things....Since I'm the vocal member, it's then attributed to me. But I would say these ideas and directions and thoughts and actions are easily fifty-fifty attributable.\\" Honorary distinctions Janzen has been subject to recognition many times in the USA, as well as in Europe and Latin America; the monetary endowments of these prizes have been invested in the trust fund of the ACG or another of his conservation's projects in Costa Rica; amongst the 19 prizes and distinctions, the following are the most important: * 1975, The Henry Allan Gleason Award, Botanical Society of America * 1984, Crafoord Prize: Coevolutionary ecology.

Camp history The camp was situated on a former army training ground (√úbungsplatz), and had been used during World War I as a camp for Russian prisoners. In 1933 it was established as one of the first Nazi concentration camps, to house German communists. In late September 1939 the camp was changed to a prisoner-of-war camp to house Polish soldiers from the September Campaign, particularly those from the Pomorze Army. In December 1940, 1,691 Polish prisoners were recorded as being there. At first they lived in tents, throughout the severe winter of 1939-1940, and construction of all the huts was not completed until 1941. In June 1940 French and Belgian prisoners from the Battle of France began to arrive. To make room for them, many of the Poles lost their status as POWs and become civilian slave laborers. The construction of the second camp, Lager-Ost (\\"East Compound\\") began in June 1941 to accommodate the large numbers of Soviet prisoners taken in Operation Barbarossa. It was located south of the railway tracks. In November 1941 a typhoid fever epidemic broke out in Lager-Ost. A total of 38,383 Soviet POWs were held Stalag II B. In August 1943 the first American prisoners arrived, having been taken prisoner in the Tunisian campaign. In April 1945 the camp was liberated by the Soviet Red Army. United States Army Official Report, 1 November 1945 =The prison= In August 1943 the Stalag was reported as newly opened to privates of the US ground forces with a strength of 451. The Hammerstein installation acted as a headquarters for work detachments in the region and seldom housed more than one fifth of the POWs credited to it. Thus at the end of May 1944, although the strength was listed as 4,807, only 1,000 of these were in the enclosure. At its peak in January 1945, the camp strength was put at 7,200 Americans, with some 5,315 of these out on 9 major Arbeitskommando (\\"Work Companies\\"). =Description= Map of the Stalag IIB POW compounds The camp sprawled over surrounded by the usual two barbed-wire fences. Additional fences formed compounds and sub-compounds. Ten thousand Russians were detained in the East Compound, while the other nationalities -- 16,000 French, 1,600 Serbs, 900 Belgians -- and the Americans were segregated by nationality in the North Compound. Within the American enclosure were the playing field, workshops and dispensary, showers, and delouser. At times more than 600 men were quartered in each of the three single-story barracks wide and long. Despite these extremely crowded barracks, conditions contrasted well with the Russian barracks which held as many as 1,000 POWs apiece. Barracks were divided in two by a centre washroom which had twenty taps. Water fit for drinking was available at all hours except during the last two months when it was turned off for part of the day. Bunks were the regulation POW triple- decker bunk beds with excelsior mattresses and one German blanket (plus two from the Red Cross) for each man. In the front and rear of each barracks was a urinal to be used only at night. Three stoves provided what heat there was for the front half of each barrack, and two for the rear half. The fuel ration was always insufficient, and in December 1944 was cut to its all-time low of of coal per stove per day. On warm days the Germans withheld part of the fuel ration. =German personnel= *Commandant - Oberstleutnant Von Bernuth *Commandant - Oberst Von Keppler *Executive Officer - Oberstleutnant Segars *Kommando Officer - Hauptmann Springer *Security Officer- Hauptmann Giesel *Medical Officer- Hauptmann Wagner *Chief Censor - Unteroffizier Krause *Lager NCO - Feldwebel Kohler *Kommando NCO - Unteroffizer Wendorf =Treatment of prisoners= =Forced labor= Except for housekeeping chores benefiting POWs, no work was performed in the Stalag. All men fit to work were set out to Kommandos where conditions approximated the following: A group of 29 Americans were taken under guard to a huge farm from Stolp, where 12 French POWs were already working without guards. Americans were billeted in a section of a large brick-floored barn. Adjoining sections were occupied by pigs, cattle and grain. POWs slept on double-decker bunk beds under two blankets. The French had a small building of their own. Guards lived in a small room opening onto the Americans' quarters. Each day the men rose at 06:00 and breakfasted on Red Cross food and potato soup, bread and hot water (for coffee) which they drew from the farm kitchen. At 06:30 they washed their spoons and enameled bowls and cleaned their barracks. They shaved and washed themselves in three large wash pans filled from a single spigot which gave only cold water. The outdoor latrine was a 3-seater. At 07:00 they rode out to potato fields in horse-drawn wagons driven by \\"coldly hostile German farmhands\\" who would welcome the opportunity to shoot a \\"kriege.\\" Under the watchful, armed guards they dug potatoes until 11:30 when they rode back to the farm for the noon meal. This consisted of Red Cross food supplemented by German vegetable soup. Boarding the wagons at 13:00, POWs worked until 16:30. The evening meal at 17:00 consisted of Red Cross food and the farmers' issue of soup, potatoes and gravy. After this meal they could sit outdoors in the fenced-in pen of by until 18:30, after which the guard locked them in their section for the night. On Sundays, the guard permitted POWs to lounge or to walk back and forth in the \\"yard\\" all day, but they spent a good deal of their time scrubbing their barracks and washing their clothing. Sunday dinner from the farm usually include a meat pudding and cheese. Once a month each POW received a large Red Cross food box containing four regulation Red Cross parcels. These were transmitted to distant Kommandos by rail and to nearby units by German Army trucks. Parcels were stored in the guards' room until issued. The average tour of duty on a farm Kommando lasted indefinitely. On other work detachments it lasted until the specific project had been completed. =Evacuation and liberation= On 28 January 1945, POWs received instructions to be ready to evacuate the camp at 08:00 hours the following morning. Upon receipt of these instructions, M/Sgt. John M. McMahan, the \\"Man of Confidence\\" (MOC) (a prisoner selected to liaise with the camp authorities) set up a plan of organisation based on 25-man groups and 200 man companies with NCOs in charge. On the day of the evacuation, however, POWs were moved out of camp in such a manner that the original plan was of little assistance. German guards ordered POWs to fall out of the barracks. When 1,200 men had assembled on the road, the remaining 500 were allowed to stay in the barracks. A disorganised column of 1,200 marched out into the cold and snow. The guards were considerate, and Red Cross food was available. After the first day, the column was broken down into three groups of 400 men each, with NCOs in charge of each group. For the next three months, the column was on the move, marching an average of a day 6 days a week. German rations were neither regular nor adequate. At almost every stop McMahan bartered coffee, cigarettes, or chocolate for potatoes which he issued to the men. Bread, the most important item, was not issued regularly. When it was needed most it was never available. The soup was, as a rule, typical watery German soup, but several times POW got a good, thick dried-pea soup. Through the activity of some of the key NCOs, Red Cross food was obtained from POW camps passed by the column on the march. Without it, it is doubtful that the majority of men could have finished the march. The ability of the men to steal helped a lot. The weather was atrocious. It always seemed to be either bitter cold or raining or snowing. Quarters were usually unheated barns and stables. Sometimes they slept unsheltered on the ground; sometimes they were fortunate enough to find a heated barn. Except for one period when Red Cross food was exhausted and guards became surly, morale of the men remained at a high level. Practically all the men shaved at every opportunity and kept their appearance as neat as possible under the circumstances. From time to time weak POWs would drop out of the column and wait to be picked up by other columns which were on the move. Thus at Dahlen on 6‚Äì7 March the column dwindled to some 900 American POWs. On 19 March at Tramm, 800 men were sent to work on Kommandos, leaving only 133 POWs who were joined a week later by the Large Kommando Company from Lauenberg. On 13 April the column was strafed by four Spitfires near Dannenberg. Ten POWs were killed. The rest of the column proceeded to Marlag X-C, Westertimke, where they met the men they had left behind at Stalag II-B who had left on 18 February, reached Stalag X-B after an easy three-day trip, and then moved on to adjacent Marlag X-C on 16 April. Westertimke was liberated by the British on 28 April 1945.

History and structure Tracing its roots back to the 1987 Second National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights, the group further coalesced in 1990 when BiPol convened the first National Bisexual Conference in San Francisco. At that time a conference track was dedicated to creating a national organization. This first conference was attended by over 450 people from 20 states and 5 countries, and the mayor of San Francisco sent a proclamation \\"commending the bisexual rights community for its leadership in the cause of social justice\\", and declaring June 23, 1990 Bisexual Pride Day. The following summer, the North American Bisexual Network was formalized in Seattle. Later its name would change to BiNet USA which coincided with the group becoming a nonprofit organization. In its first decade, BiNet USA worked on a variety of campaigns, national policy initiatives and hosted/co-hosted a number conferences. Moving into its second decade, BiNet USA, like many other U.S. charitable organizations, was hit hard when funding dried up in the wake of the 9/11 attacks on the US mainland in September 2001. It was forced to lay off its paid staff and roll back its plans for new office space. Faced with these new economic and logistical realities, BiNet USA begins to focus more of its efforts on Internet activism using the Internet as an organizing tool for community growth. It uses an \\"800\\" phone number, its Website, a MySpace Page, Facebook Group and its very active ListServ, established using Yahoo Groups to facilitate communication between various and disparate bisexual, pansexual and fluid communities and activists nationwide. In 2005, after a period of progress marked by growing acceptance in both the larger LGBT & straight communities, the bisexual community suddenly came under a new attack promulgated by the publication of a study entitled \\"Sexual Arousal Patterns of Bisexual Men\\" by the controversial researcher J. Michael Bailey. This study allegedly \\"proved\\" that bisexual men did not exist. With little critical examination, various media celebrities and outlets jumped on the band-wagon and claimed to have \\"solved\\" the \\"problem of bisexuality\\" by declaring it to be non-existent, at least in men. Working with other established LGBT institutions such as the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force GLAAD, the Bisexual Resource Center as well as newer ones such as Bialogue, BiNet USA moved to co-ordinate a national response to this threat to the well-being of the bisexual community. It has now revitalized and updated its 'Rapid-Response Spokesperson Team' and now monitors and responds quickly to media portrayals of the bisexual community. Starting in 2008 under the leadership of its then president Wendy Curry, who is herself a software engineer, BiNet USA greatly expanded its use of Internet activism taking advantage of the flowering of a variety of Social networking venues including the popular Live Journal Blogging tool, Myspace and Facebook products. In September 2009, BiNet USA expanded its board of directors, making Gary B. North the new president. In October 2009, BiNet USA endorsed the National Equality March and helped organize a contingent of several bisexual groups that participated in the march. In 2014, BiNet USA declared the seven days surrounding Celebrate Bisexuality Day to be Bi Awareness Week, also called Bisexual Awareness Week. The week begins the Sunday before Celebrate Bisexuality Day. =Structure= BiNet USA was incorporated as a nonprofit organization in Florida on February 14, 1994.\\"BiNet/USA, The BiSexual Network of the USA Inc.\\" Florida Division of Corporations.

These were the first commercial computers from IBM that were based on a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) architecture. The RT PC used IBM's proprietary ROMP microprocessor, which commercialized technologies pioneered by IBM Research's 801 experimental minicomputer (the 801 was the first RISC). The RT PC ran three operating systems: AIX, the Academic Operating System (AOS), or Pick. The RT PC's performance was relatively poor compared to other contemporary workstations and it had little commercial success as a result; IBM responded by introducing the RISC System/6000 workstations in 1990, which used a new IBM-proprietary RISC processor, the POWER1. All RT PC models were discontinued by May 1991. Hardware Two basic types were produced, a floor-standing desk-side tower, and a table-top desktop. Both types featured a special board slot for the processor card, as well as machine specific RAM cards. Each machine had one processor slot, one co-processor slot, and two RAM slots. There were three versions of the processor card: * The Standard Processor Card or 032 card had a 5.88MHz clock rate (170ns cycle time), 1MB of standard memory (expandable via 1, 2, or 4MB memory boards). It could be accompanied by an optional Floating-Point Accelerator (FPA) board, which contained a 10MHz National Semiconductor NS32081 floating point coprocessor. This processor card was used in the original RT PC models (010, 020, 025, and A25) announced on January 21, 1986.https://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/ShowDoc.wss?docURL=/common/ssi/rep_ca/6/897/ENUS186-006/index.html‚ü®=en * The Advanced Processor Card had a 10MHz clock (100ns) and either 4MB memory on the processor card, or external 4MB ECC memory cards, and featured a built- in 20MHz Motorola 68881 floating-point processor. The Advanced Processor Card could be accompanied by an optional Advanced Floating-Point Accelerator (AFPA) board, which was based around the Analog Devices ADSP-3220 FP multiplier and ADSP-3221 FP ALU. Models 115, 125, and B25 used these cards. These models were announced on February 17, 1987.https://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/ShowDoc.wss?docURL=/common/ssi/rep_ca/1/897/ENUS187-021/index.html‚ü®=en * The Enhanced Advanced Processor Card sported a 12.5MHz clock (80ns), 16MB on-board memory, while an enhanced advanced floating point accelerator was standard. The models 130, 135, and B35 used these cards. They were announced on July 19, 1988.https://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/ShowDoc.wss?docURL=/common/ssi/rep_ca/0/897/ENUS188-120/index.html‚ü®=en All RT PCs supported up to 16MB of memory. Early models were limited to 4MB of memory because of the capacity of the DRAM ICs used, later models could have up to 16MB. I/O was provided by eight ISA bus slots. Storage was provided by a 40 or 70MB hard drive, upgradeable to 300MB. External SCSI cabinets could be used to provide more storage. Also standard were mouse and either a 720√ó512 or 1024√ó768 pixel-addressable display, and a 4Mbit/s Token Ring network adapter or 10BASE2 Ethernet adapter. For running CADAM, a computer-aided design (CAD) program, an IBM 5080 or 5085 graphics processor could be attached. The 5080 and 5085 were contained in a large cabinet that would have been positioned alongside the RT PC. The 5080 was used with a 1,024- by 1,024-pixel IBM 5081 display. =6152 Academic System= The 6152 Academic System was a PS/2 Model 60 with a RISC Adapter Card, a Micro Channel board containing a ROMP, its support ICs, and up to 8MB of memory. It allowed the PS/2 to run ROMP software compiled for the AOS. AOS was downloaded from a RT PC running AOS, via a LAN TCP/IP interface. Software One of the novel aspects of the RT design was the use of a microkernel. The keyboard, mouse, display, disk drives and network were all controlled by a microkernel, called Virtual Resource Manager (VRM), which allowed multiple operating systems to be booted and run at the same time. One could \\"hotkey\\" from one operating system to the next using the Alt-Tab key combination. Each OS in turn would get possession of the keyboard, mouse and display. Both AIX version 2 and the Pick operating system were ported to this microkernel. Pick was unique in being a unified operating system and database, and ran various accounting applications. It was popular with retail merchants, and accounted for about 4,000 units of sales. The primary operating system for the RT was AIX version 2. Much of the AIX v2 kernel was written in a variant of the PL/I programming language, which proved troublesome during the migration to AIX v3. AIX v2 included full TCP/IP networking support, as well as SNA, and two networking file systems: NFS, licensed from Sun Microsystems, and IBM Distributed Services (DS). DS had the distinction of being built on top of SNA, and thereby being fully compatible with DS on the IBM midrange AS/400 and mainframe systems. For the graphical user interfaces, AIX v2 came with the X10R3 and later the X10R4 and X11 releases of the X Window System from MIT, together with the Athena widget set. Compilers for C and Fortran programming languages were available. Some RT PCs were also shipped with the Academic Operating System (AOS), an IBM port of 4.3BSD Unix to the RT PC. It was offered as an alternative to AIX, the usual RT PC operating system, to US universities eligible for an IBM educational discount. AOS added a few extra features to 4.3BSD, notably NFS, and an almost ANSI C-compliant C compiler. A later version of AOS existed that was derived from 4.3BSD-Reno, but it was not widely distributed. The RT forced an important stepping-stone in the development of the X Window System, when a group at Brown University ported X version 9 to the system. Problems with reading unaligned data on the RT forced an incompatible protocol change, leading to version 10 in late 1985. Sales and market reception The IBM RT had a varied life even from its initial announcement. Most industry watchers considered the RT as \\"not enough power, too high a price, and too late.\\" Many thought that the RT was part of IBM's Personal Computer line of computers. This confusion started with its initial name, \\"IBM RT PC\\". Initially, it seemed that even IBM thought that it was a high-end Personal Computer given the initially stunning lack of support that it received from IBM. This could be explained by the sales commission structure the IBM gave the system: salesmen received commissions similar to those for the sale of a PC. With typically configured models priced at $20,000, it was a hard sell, and the lack of any reasonable commission lost the interest of IBM's sales force. Both MIT's Project Athena and Brown University's Institute for Research in Information and Scholarship found the RT inferior to other computers. The performance of the RT, in comparison with other contemporaneous Unix workstations, was not outstanding. In particular, the floating point performance was poor, and was scandalized mid-life with the discovery of a bug in the floating point square root routine. With the RT system's modest processing power (when first announced), and with announcements later that year by some other workstation vendors, industry analysts questioned IBM's directions. AIX for the RT was IBM's second foray into UNIX (its first was PC/IX for the IBM PC in September 1984.) The lack of software packages and IBM's sometimes lackluster support of AIX, in addition to sometimes unusual changes from traditional, de facto UNIX operating system standards, caused most software suppliers to be slow in embracing the RT and AIX. The RT found its home mostly in the CAD/CAM and CATIA markets, with some inroads into the scientific and educational areas, especially after the announcement of AOS and substantial discounts for the educational community. The RT running the Pick OS also found use as shopping store control systems, given the strong database, accounting system and general business support in the Pick OS. The RT also did well as an interface system between IBM's larger mainframes, due to its SNA and DS support, and some of its point-of-sale terminals, store control systems, and machine shop control systems. Approximately 23,000 RTs were sold over its lifetime, with some 4,000 going into IBM's development and sales organizations. Pick OS sales accounted for about 4,000 units. When the RT PC was introduced in January 1986, it competed with several workstations from established providers: the Apollo Computer Domain Series 3000, the DEC MicroVAX II, and Sun Microsystems Sun-3.

The RAH provides tertiary health care services for South Australia and provides secondary care clinical services to residents of Adelaide's central metropolitan area, which includes the inner suburbs. The original Adelaide Hospital was built in 1840 at the eastern end of North Terrace, Adelaide, with its first building superseded in 1856 and many alterations and additions over the following 175 years. It was prefixed by the \\"Royal\\" in 1939. In 2017 it was replaced by the new hospital, sometimes referred to as nRAH or NRAH, built at the western end of North Terrace and at the time the most expensive building ever built in Australia, at in construction and equipment costs. The redevelopment on the site of the old RAH is known as Lot Fourteen.  History  = 1841‚Äì2017: Original hospital buildings = The East Wing of the old RAH Colonel Light had originally envisaged the hospital in the Eastern parklands. On 15 July 1840 Lieutenant-Colonel George Gawler, then governor of South Australia, laid the foundation stone for the Adelaide Hospital, which is regarded as the hospital's foundation day, although the first patients were only admitted in January or February of the following year. It was located in the Adelaide Park Lands on the north side of North Terrace, east of Frome Road. In 1856, around the time of the establishment of the Adelaide Botanic Garden to the east, a second building was completed on the site, and the original hospital was used to house patients from the nearby Adelaide Lunatic Asylum, which was sold off to the Botanic Garden. In 1891 the hospital opened its first operating theatre, with rows of raised seating to enable students and others to witness operations. In 1899, only four years after x-ray was discovered, an x-ray facility was opened, by 1939 boasting an extensive X-ray department for the treatment of cancer. The hospital installed its first telephone system in 1901 and performed its first blood transfusion in 1925. The hospital was officially proclaimed \\"Royal\\" on 2 November 1939, at this time the largest general hospital in Australia, and included a modern dental hospital It also functioned as a teaching hospital for medical and dental students, in conjunction with the University of Adelaide (a partnership which has continued to the present day). The old RAH stood adjacent to both the University of Adelaide (established 1874) and the University of South Australia (established as South Australian School of Mines and Industries on that site in 1889). Its campus was also home to the University of Adelaide's Medical School, the Hanson Institute and SA Pathology. In 1995 Mika H√§kkinen after a bad crash in the season ender when he fractured his skull, he donated a large sum of money so the hospital could get a much needed helicopter pad. Source https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mika_H√§kkinen The old hospital morgue still stands in the Botanic Gardens. The old RAH included an advanced burns unit, the Adult Burn Centre, led by 2016 SA Australian of the Year, John Greenwood and in 2009 became the only burns unit to be verified by the American Burn Association outside of North America. The Royal Adelaide Hospital was and still is the only provider of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in South Australia. Its Hyperbaric Medical Unit (HMU) opened in 1985. The principal treatment equipment as of 2013 was a pair of twin-lock, multi-place hyperbaric chambers. One of these chambers was the first rectangular steel chamber in Australia. After the completion of the new building in 2017, a phased move to the new premises took place, and the old site was designated Lot Fourteen, with various plans mooted regarding its redevelopment. =2017: New building (NRAH)= The new RAH and SAHMRI buildings in the emerging BioMed City being constructed over former railyards. The new Royal Adelaide Hospital (nRAH) is located on a former railyards site within the Adelaide Park Lands. It is situated on the north side of North Terrace and west of Morphett Street.HOME  SA Health Partnership Starting construction in 2011, it cost more than A$2 billion, making it one of the most expensive buildings ever built. The contractor was a joint venture of Hansen Yuncken and Leighton Contractors. The new Royal Adelaide Hospital (nRAH) was completed in 2017, and the move from the old hospital into the new site was completed over four days, 4‚Äì7 September. More than 6,000 staff are expected to work at the hospital, and all rooms are single patient suites with private bathroom facilities. There are 40 operating theatres, each measuring 65m2.New Royal Adelaide Hospital, CPB Contractors The nRAH is technologically advanced, with a fleet of automated robotic vehicles to help move supplies, meals and equipment around the hospital, and a tailor-made patient electronic medical record (EMR). The hospital was designed to achieve a 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to equivalent hospitals. A co-generation system uses waste heat from energy generators for the domestic hot water system. Orientation of the buildings is optimised to minimise solar thermal loads, with extensive daylight penetration to reduce artificial lighting requirements. Rainwater and stormwater harvesting is used to offset potable water requirements, along with extensive use of water sensitive landscaping and a water efficient thermal plant. The new hospital was initially to be renamed \\"Marjorie Jackson-Nelson Hospital\\" after the former Governor of South Australia, however, in 2009 the RAH name was retained after public opposition and at the former governor's request. Description =BioMed City= The new RAH forms the largest part of Adelaide's emerging biomedical precinct called BioMed City. Other recently completed facilities in the precinct include the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute (SAHMRI), the University of Adelaide Health and Medical Sciences building, the University of South Australia's Health Innovation Building, and the state's Dental Hospital. SAHMRI is building a $300 million second facility due to be completed by 2022 to house the Australian Bragg Centre with Australia's first proton therapy unit. There are also plans for the Women's and Children's Hospital to be relocated to the precinct adjacent the RAH by 2024. =Specialist facilities = Hyperbaric Medical Unit The HMU, opened at the old RAH in 1985, is the state referral service for diving and hyperbaric medicine. The RAH is the second oldest diving and hyperbaric facility in Australia, and has been responsible for co- ordinating the Divers Emergency Service (DES), a telephone-based consultation service for diving-related matters within Australia, the Southern Pacific and Southeast Asia.

The film is directed by Martin Ritt and is based in part on Rawlings's 1942 memoir Cross Creek. Plot In 1928 in New York State, aspiring author Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings (Steenburgen) advises her husband that her last book was rejected by a publisher, she has bought an orange grove in Florida, and she is leaving him to go there. She drives to the nearest town alone, and arrives in time for her car to die. Local resident Norton Baskin (Peter Coyote) takes her the rest of the distance to a dilapidated and overgrown cabin attached to an even more overgrown orange grove. Despite Baskin's (and her own) doubts, she stays and begins to fix up the property. The local residents of \\"the Creek\\" begin to interact with her. Marsh Turner (Rip Torn) comes around with his daughter Ellie (Dana Hill), a teenage girl who keeps a deer fawn as a pet named Flag. A black woman, Geechee (Alfre Woodard), arrives and offers to work for her, even though Rawlings insists she cannot pay her much. The grove languishes below her expectations and Rawlings writes another novel, hoping to get it published. A young married couple moves into a cabin on Rawlings's property. The woman is very pregnant and they reject Rawlings's attempts to help them. Rawlings employs the assistance of a few of the Creek residents, Geechee and Baskin, to unblock a vital irrigation vein for her grove, and it begins to improve. The young couple has their child. Ellie's deer grows older and escapes her pen, and Marsh foretells that the deer will have to be killed for eating all their food. Geechee's husband comes to stay with her after being released from prison, and Rawlings offers him a place to work in her grove, but he refuses and Rawlings asks him to leave. Even though her husband drinks and gambles, Geechee goes to leave with him, and Rawlings admits she will be sad to see Geechee leave, after Geechee demands to know why Rawlings would allow a friend to make such a mistake. Geechee decides to stay after all after telling Rawlings that she should learn how to treat her friends better. Rawlings submits her novel, a gothic romance, to Max Perkins, and it is rejected again. He writes to ask her to write stories about the people she describes so well in her letters instead of the English governess stories she has been writing. She does so immediately, beginning with the story of the young married couple (which eventually becomes \\"Jacob's Ladder,\\" published in Scribner's Magazine in 1931). During a visit to the Turners' home on Ellie's 14th birthday, Flag escapes his pen once more and Marsh is forced to shoot him after he eats the family's vegetables. Ellie screams at him in hatred, and Marsh goes on a bender, goes into town and attracts the sheriff's attention. The sheriff finds Marsh drinking moonshine with a shotgun across his lap and demands the gun. When Marsh offers it to him, the sheriff shoots him. The story becomes the basis for The Yearling. At Marsh‚Äôs funeral, Ellie blames Marjorie for both her father‚Äôs and Flag‚Äôs deaths and tells her to leave. Rejected and heartbroken, Rawlings leaves her home in a motorboat and rides down the waterways for several miles. After more than a day in complete isolation and loneliness out in the water, she returns to her home and is happily reunited with Geechee. A few nights later, Marjorie and Geechee find themselves battling to save their orange grove from the autumn frost. Her neighbors arrive to help her out, and among them are Ellie and her younger siblings. Ellie apologizes to Marjorie for her behavior towards her at her father‚Äôs funeral, stating that ‚Äúgood friends shouldn‚Äôt keep apart,‚Äù and they both reconcile each other as friends again. Max Perkins (Malcolm McDowell) visits and accepts her story \\"Jacob's Ladder\\" upon reading it. Baskin asks Rawlings to marry him, and she accepts after much hesitation about her independence. Rawlings realizes her profound attachment to the land at Cross Creek.

But that would depend on what the actor brought to it. I thought this woman was quite wise and very much in touch with the earth. She was alive and I fell in love with her immediately. I wasn't prejudiced against her because she had to work for a white woman for a living, which any Black woman, even myself, would have had to do if she'd lived in Florida in 1925.

Radnitz said the location was almost another character in the film.CROSS CREEK Laursen, Byron. Los Angeles Times 29 Apr 1983: n14. Rawlings's husband, Norton Baskin, the hotel proprietor whom she met when she moved to Florida played by Peter Coyote in the film, came on location several times. He also had a cameo as the elderly man who directs Marjorie to Norton Baskin's hotel. \\"I was tickled to death when I met Peter Coyote,\\" said Baskin. \\"He was macho as hell, which I wasn't. He is 6 foot 1, handsome and athletic, whereas I'm 5 feet 8 and anything but. I always wanted to look like that.\\" \\"A lot of people down there really glorified and romanticized Marjorie, whereas Norton tended to be real straight about her,\\" said Steenburgen. \\"It's very easy to approach a character like that - a so-called strong woman who overcomes the odds - and give a one-note performance, playing that strength alone. Strength is only one thing a person has. I'm real strong, and I'm also real feminine, and I don't find a struggle having those two things under one roof. Norton helped me to see that the same was true of Marjorie.\\" Steenburgen said, \\"The movie is about what it takes to make a writer write - it's essentially an internal struggle - and it's very hard to do that, to be that quiet. Technically, I never found a key to it, but I did understand her compulsion, her passion. She was - I don't know a pretty phrase for it - emotionally constipated, and didn't feel she could be part of anything until she proved herself as a writer.\\"Little Mary from Little Rock finds happiness Scott, Jay.

You tend to get self-indulgent and overly dramatic. I don't know if I licked the problem, but I don't think I make people cringe. I tried to show her passion for wanting to be the best writer she could possibly be.\\" \\"I'm sure some critics will feel we haven't dramatized the creative process,\\" said Ritt. \\"But that's really not what this picture is about. It's about a community and its people and their impress on Marjorie Rawlings. Fundamentally, it's about the land, because that's what inspired Marjorie and gave her a chance to fulfill herself.\\" \\"I love Cross Creek,\\" Steenburgen said. \\"I think it's a much more wonderful movie than what I ever expected. Some movies are like home movies to the people who participated in them, and that's what Cross Creek is like for me. I watch the scenes with Rip (Torn) and remember what it was like doing them. It's so much fun working with him. You're never quite sure what you're going to get with him. You know it's going to be something truthful. A scene was always lively when he was in on it because he was so unpredictable. You had to be ready for anything. It's a nice fright, though.

Since accounting is a highly technical, standards oriented profession, both practitioners and academics may claim to be experts. Accounting directly impacts many other specialties in business and is closely linked with finance. The theoretical underpinnings of both accounting and finance are derived from economics. Accounting academia Requirements for an appointment as a professor vary considerably worldwide. Once appointed as a professor, the next step is being awarded tenure. At most institutions, this step is very competitive. Many institutions value academic credentials, professional certifications, and real world experience.Nuttall, Garrison Lee and Snow, Neal M. and Summers, Scott L. and Wood, David A., Citation-Based Benchmarks and Individual Accounting Faculty Research Rankings by Topical Area and Methodology (June 18, 2016). Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2608491 or https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2608491 Accounting has generally been oriented towards practical knowledge as opposed to theoretical abstractions. Most students are entering the field for immediate practical knowledge. Adult learner/executive students often expect professors to have practical experience as an accountant or in commercial organizations. These students expect practical examples and an MBA case study approach to their education. By contrast, PhD students prefer research professors who themselves earned a PhD in accounting.  Types of research There are two broad types of accounting research: * Positive accounting * Normative accounting Areas of research Accounting scholarship deals with the following areas: * Accounting * Auditing * Taxation * Financial management * Professional ethics * Corporate governance * Controllership * Entrepreneurship * Experimental economics * Agency theory Accounting research can be tailored to a specific industry or knowledge-based, such as accounting for law firms or hotels as well as accounting for quality. Accounting Scholarship Rankings The ability of researchers and institutions to produce quality accounting research is an important factor in many decisions made in the academic community. Such decisions may include, which program a perspective Ph.D. student should attend, where a professor should teach, and whom to collaborate with on a project. As such, many studies have been performed to rank accounting institutions and individual faculty membersNuttall, G. L., Snow, N. M., Summers, S. L., & Wood, D. A. (2015). Citation-based benchmarks and individual accounting faculty research rankings by topical area and methodology. Available at SSRN 2608491. based on their research performance in order to provide decision makers with useful information. Empirical studies have documented that leading accounting journals publish in total fewer research articles than comparable journals in economics and other business disciplines, and consequently, accounting scholars are relatively less successful in academic publishing than their business school peers. Due to different publication rates between accounting and other business disciplines, a recent study based on academic author rankings concludes that the competitive value of a single publication in a top-ranked journal is highest in accounting and lowest in marketing.  Difference from scholarship in finance Finance, which is another specialization of business schools, is related to accounting. However, accounting scholarship focuses more strongly on distinctive bodies of knowledge such as financial reporting, financial management, auditing, information management and taxation. Finance, on the other hand, is oriented more towards management of investments and other liquid assets. Others differences between scholarship in finance and accounting include the number of citations articles receive, word count, and length of the publication process. Accounting and economics The theoretical basis of the central concepts with which accounting is concerned, including profit, cost, revenue and capital is derived from economics. In turn, accounting concepts play an important role in economics, most notably in relation to national accounts. United Kingdom In the United Kingdom, many Professors of Accounting are members of one of four registered auditors and Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies members including ACCA, ICAEW, ICAS and ICAI recognized under the Companies Act. Refer to the articles on Chartered accountant and Chartered Certified Accountant (ACCA) for more information about UK government policy for top MBAs in 2004. It is, however, by no means compulsory. The key criterion for being offered a professorship, or chair, is the contribution to research evaluated on the basis of published articles in scholarly journals. United States of America In the United States, the minimum requirement for appointment as an instructor at an accredited university is a bachelor's degree in accounting and an additional eighteen credits of accounting post- graduate study. A post graduate degree, such as an MBA or Masters of Accountancy, is highly recommended. A Ph.D. in accounting or a related field is required for an appointment at a top tier business school, especially one in which research is undertaken. Being licensed as a Certified Public Accountant is also strongly recommended. The outlook for accounting programs in the United States is looking up. While the number of accounting students had dropped from its peak in 1993 and 1994 when there were 60,000 students enrolled in accounting programs, there were 37,000 undergraduate degrees awarded in 2002‚Äì2003. This represents a 6% increase from the previous year. There were also 12,655 graduate degrees awarded, a 30% increase. The causes of this increase have been ascribed to the loss of jobs in Information Technology due to the recent dot com crash, as well as the full-employment aspects of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the effects of all of the recent accounting scandals.

It ran for two seasons on CBS before producing a final season for syndication. Series history After the original Twilight Zone series ended in 1964, Rod Serling sold the rights to the series to CBS, which allowed for a revival of the show by the network. As an in-house production, they stood to earn more money producing The Twilight Zone than they could by purchasing a new series produced by an outside company. Even so, the network was slow to consider a revival, shooting down offers from the original production team of Rod Serling and Buck Houghton and later from American filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola. Their hesitation stemmed from concerns familiar to the original series: The Twilight Zone had never been the breakaway hit CBS wanted, so they should not expect it to do better in a second run. \\"We were looking at the success of the original series in syndication and the enormous popularity of the Steven Spielberg films,\\" said CBS program chief Harvey Shepard. \\"Many of them (such as E.T. or Poltergeist) deal with elements of the show. Perhaps the public is ready for it again.\\" Despite the lukewarm response to Twilight Zone: The Movie, Spielberg's theatrical homage to the original series, CBS in 1984 decided to move forward with a new Twilight Zone series under the supervision of Carla Singer, then Vice President of Drama Development. Writers and filmmakers involved included Harlan Ellison, George R. R. Martin, Rockne S. O'Bannon, Jeremy Bertrand Finch, Paul Chitlik and directors Wes Craven and William Friedkin. Casts featured stars including Bruce Willis, Helen Mirren, Season Hubley, Morgan Freeman, Martin Landau, Jonathan Frakes, and Fred Savage. New theme music was composed and performed by Grateful Dead with Merl Saunders, incorporating elements of the classic theme to the original Twilight Zone by Marius Constant (used in seasons 2‚Äì5). Grateful Dead also provided incidental music for a number of episodes in the series. Rod Serling had died in 1975, so he was not available to narrate the new series; this was done instead by Charles Aidman‚Äîhimself the star of two classic Twilight Zone episodes. The new series ran for two seasons. Most episodes were one hour long, but some of them presented two or three stories within the one-hour time. Some episodes in season 2 were 30 minutes long, and a third season of half-hour episodes was produced in 1988 to expand the series' syndication package. Robin Ward replaced Aidman as the narrator of these Canadian-produced episodes. Unlike Serling‚Äîwhose image appears fleetingly in the revival's opening credits‚Äîand Forest Whitaker, host of the 2002 revival, and Jordan Peele, host of the 2019 revival, neither Aidman nor Ward appeared on screen. =Episodes= =First season (1985‚Äì86)= The Twilight Zone debuted the night of September 27, 1985 to a generally warm reception: it won its Friday-night time slot in four of its first five weeks. Episodes featured adaptations of stories by Harlan Ellison (whose \\"Shatterday\\" launched the new series), Greg Bear, Ray Bradbury, Arthur C. Clarke, Robert McCammon, and Stephen King. A new batch of scripts was supplemented with remakes of classic Twilight Zone episodes like \\"Dead Man's Shoes\\", \\"Shadow Play\\", and \\"Night of the Meek\\". Though the production crew was convinced that they were making all of the right decisions, ratings began to slide as the novelty of the show wore off. \\"You have not known humiliation until you have been beaten by Webster and Mr. Belvedere\\", said executive story consultant Alan Brennert. Wes Craven directed several episodes including \\"Shatterday\\", \\"A Little Peace and Quiet\\", \\"Wordplay\\", and \\"Chameleon\\". Other first-season episodes included \\"Healer\\", \\"Dreams for Sale\\", \\"Examination Day\\", \\"Children's Zoo\\", \\"Kentucky Rye\\", and \\"Nightcrawlers\\". The DVD release includes several episode commentaries by Executive Producer Philip Deguere. On these DVD extras, he states that CBS initially told him the show would air at 10 PM and therefore the earliest episodes were written with that time slot in mind. The late and unexpected rescheduling of the show to the 8 PM family viewing time slot resulted in the broadcast of the first six episodes in a time slot Mr. Deguere states were inappropriate for their content. He attributes the intensity of the earliest aired episodes, considered by him as not the best fare to be broadcast during family viewing time slot, as the reason why the series ratings dropped and never recovered. That the show's producers had even managed to hire Harlan Ellison was considered by many to be nothing short of miraculous; Ellison was an extremely vocal critic of television who had already published two collections of essays on the subject, \\"concluding that to work in television is akin to putting in time in the Egyptian House of the Dead.\\" These feelings surfaced once again when the script he submitted for Twilight Zones Christmas special‚Äîan adaptation of Donald E. Westlake's 1964 story \\"Nackles\\", in which an obnoxious and mean-spirited drunk frightens his children with stories of a malicious anti-Santa Claus‚Äîwas rejected by CBS' West Coast Program Practices. The segment, which was to be Ellison's directorial debut, was halted in mid- production. This cost the program between $150,000 and $300,000 and Ellison's services as a creative consultant. \\"[Their] suggestions were vile, infamous!\\" Ellison recalled of his aborted attempts to change the network's mind. On the DVD release, Mr. Ellison further expounds on his experiences during four audio commentaries to four of his stories that were adapted for the show. The \\"Nackles\\" incident generated a flurry of press which ultimately proved inadequate to revive public interest in the series. \\"I can see why people who were expecting The Twilight Zone were disappointed with it,\\" said staff writer Michael Cassutt of the show's low ratings. \\"...our show always seemed uneven to me. There were episodes perfectly in keeping with The Twilight Zone spirit, and then others that could have been from The Outer Limits or from anything.\\" Despite poor ratings, The Twilight Zone was renewed for a second season in early 1986. =Second season (1986‚Äì87)= The series debuted in an hour-long format, but was put on hiatus only a few weeks into the season. CBS had moved the series to Saturday nights, which led to falling ratings. When The Twilight Zone returned in December, the episodes were half-hour shows, and generally contained only one story. The series was cancelled by February, with remaining episodes being burned off over the summer as hour-long multi-story episodes. Season 2 only ran for 11 episodes; several of the unproduced episodes would be filmed for season 3. In regard to writing for the episode \\"The Girl I Married\\", J. M. DeMatteis commented \\"I have a feeling that the show that appears will not bear much relation to what I wrote. What I've found out is that this season‚Äîunlike last, where the script was pretty much regarded as sacrosanct‚Äîthe network is really interfering a lot. [...] Regardless, I know I did a good job and it was a real satisfying experience.\\" =Third season (1988‚Äì89)= CBS replaced the original production team, and set out to do thirty 22-minute episodes for the third season; this way they could have enough episodes to sell the series into syndication. Robin Ward replaced Aidman as the narrator of these Canadian-produced episodes, and he also re- recorded Aidman's narration when the CBS episodes were edited for inclusion in the syndication package. To lead the writing team, the producers brought in a new group led by executive producer Mark Shelmerdine (I, Claudius) and supported by story editors Paul Chitlik, Jeremy Bertrand Finch, and J. Michael Straczynski. Straczynski authored more episodes that season than anyone else on staff. The producers named Straczynski the sole story editor following the release of Chitlik and Finch. Harlan Ellison was coaxed back to The Twilight Zone in the third season, and wrote what would be the third-to-last episode of the series, titled \\"Crazy as a Soup Sandwich.\\" Home media Image Entertainment has released The Twilight Zone on DVD in Region 1. Season 1 was released on December 28, 2004 and Seasons 2 and 3 were released together in a 7-Disc DVD on June 28, 2005. Image re-released all three seasons together with the remastered original series in a 41-disc box set on August 26, 2014. On February 7, 2017, CBS Home Entertainment (distributed by Paramount) released \\"The Complete 80s Series\\" 13-disc box set. In Region 2, Cinema Club UK has released all three seasons on DVD in the UK. Season 1 was released on September 19, 2005 on 6 DVDs, Season 2 on December 23, 2005 on 4 DVDs, and Season 3 on May 12, 2006 on 4 DVDs. In Region 4, Shock Entertainment has released the entire series on DVD in Australia. All 3 seasons were released on June 1, 2011. On October 3, 2012, Shock released a complete series box set. Alan Brennert, one of the writer-producers who contributed to the series, wrote that the picture quality of the DVD set was \\"NOT a 'bad transfer'\\" but rather that the episodes were \\"shot on film, but edited on video. In other words, the raw footage was 35 mm film, which was then transferred to videotape. Editing, dubbing, special effects‚Äîeverything was done on video. We were in fact the first drama series on television to do this. So unlike the original Rod Serling TZ, there are NO original film negatives from which Image could strike new prints for transfer. All that exist are the old one-inch master tapes, and the unfortunate reality is, videotape does deteriorate some over time. Image has, in my opinion, done a superb job packaging our series, and it is to them that I award the five stars in this review! If not for their interest in bringing this show to DVD, those one-inch masters might eventually have eroded into so much static (as my 3/4-inch tapes of the show already have).\\" He concluded by saying \\"If you enjoyed this series, just be grateful it's been preserved!\\" See also *List of The Twilight Zone (1985 TV series) episodes *The Twilight Zone *The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series) *The Twilight Zone (2002 TV series) *The Twilight Zone (2019 TV series) References *Ellison, Harlan: \\"The Deadly \\"Nackles\\" Affair\\".

(1992). Film Noir: An Encyclopedic Reference to the American Style (3rd ed.). Woodstock, New York: The Overlook Press. legal thriller written by Joe Eszterhas and directed by Richard Marquand. The film stars Glenn Close, Jeff Bridges, Peter Coyote and Robert Loggia, who was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance. Plot A masked intruder breaks into the beach house of San Francisco socialite Paige Forrester, ties her to her bed, rips open her shirt, and kills her with a hunting knife. Her husband Jack, arrested for her murder, tries to hire high- profile lawyer Teddy Barnes to defend him. Barnes is reluctant to take the case since an incident with district attorney Thomas Krasny, her former boss, caused her to quit practicing criminal law. Krasny tells Barnes that prisoner Henry Styles hanged himself, which distresses her. Barnes visits Sam Ransom, a private detective who also used to work for Krasny and who changed careers at the same time as Barnes. Barnes decides to take the case. Barnes and Forrester prepare for the trial and eventually sleep together. Ransom warns Barnes that Forrester is just trying to make her care more about his case. Her office begins receiving anonymous letters containing non-public case details and an analysis shows they were typed on a 1942 Corona typewriter. In a pre-trial meeting, Barnes tells the judge that Krasny has a history of not meeting discovery obligations. The prosecution's case relies on circumstantial evidence and two of its key witnesses are discredited by Barnes. Krasny calls Eileen Avery, who had an affair with Forrester, to testify. As Avery details her relationship with Forrester, Barnes finds it eerily similar to her own relationship with him. She feels manipulated and now believes Forrester is guilty but continues out of a sense of duty. Another note arrives at her office saying, \\"He is innocent. Santa Cruz. January 21, 1984. Ask Julie Jensen.\\" Barnes calls Jensen to testify that she was attacked in the same manner as Paige Forrester. All the details match, but she says her attacker seemed to stop himself from killing her. As Krasny objects that the attack on Jensen is unrelated to the one on Forrester, he lets slip that his office had investigated the attack and not revealed it in discovery. In chambers, the judge threatens to have Krasny disbarred. Krasny insists that Forrester planned Paige's murder for 18 months, he attacked Jensen to create an alibi for himself, and he is the writer of the anonymous letters. The judge forbids Krasny from presenting his theory to the jury and Forrester is found not guilty. Barnes announces to the media that she left the district attorney's office when Krasny suppressed evidence that proved Henry Styles was innocent. Krasny walks off in disgust. Barnes goes to Forrester's house to celebrate, and they sleep together again. In the morning, she discovers, in a closet, a 1942 Corona typewriter matching the analysis of the anonymous notes. She takes it and flees. When Forrester calls, she tells him she found the typewriter. Forrester insists on coming over. Barnes calls Ransom, on the brink of telling him that Forrester is a killer, but instead hangs up. A masked figure breaks in and confronts her in her bedroom. As he starts to attack, Barnes throws back the covers to reveal her gun. She shoots him several times until he falls to the floor. Ransom comes in and unmasks the attacker: Forrester.

Production According to Joe Eszterhas, the film originated with producer Martin Ransohoff, who wanted to make a courtroom drama in the vein of Anatomy of a Murder. The film was originally written as a vehicle for Jane Fonda, who later turned down the project. Reception On Rotten Tomatoes it has an approval rating of 81% based on 31 reviews. The site's consensus states; \\"Coolly performed and suspenseful, Jagged Edge is a satisfying enough potboiler that most audiences won't mind if the twists don't quite add up.\\" On Metacritic it has a score of 60% based on reviews from 15 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Variety called it \\"well- crafted\\" overall and praised the performances of its two lead actors.Review: 'Jagged Edge' (December 31, 1984). Variety. Retrieved October 19, 2020. Janet Maslin of The New York Times also praised the performances, but thought the film predictable. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times described the suspense in the film as \\"supremely effective\\" and rated the movie 3 1/2 stars.Ebert, Roger (October 4, 1985). \\"Jagged Edge.\\" Movie review.

Abandoned sequel The film Physical Evidence was originally conceived as a sequel to Jagged Edge and was meant to have Glenn Close and Robert Loggia reprise their roles. The story was about a private investigator framed for murder and the female lawyer who defends him. The project was developed at Columbia Pictures but then head of production Guy McElwaine was replaced by David Puttnam, who, according to producer Martin Ransohoff, said that he did not want to make sequels (Puttnam denied this, saying his problem was the script \\"wasn't good and for no other reason... when there's a terrific script for Jagged Edge II Columbia will be anxious to make it\\".). Ransohoff decided to turn the script into an original story. \\"It's a good mystery on its own terms,\\" he said. \\"I think the story is really more effective as an original. Because there wasn't an agreement with Loggia and Close, we had always designed the project to go either as a sequel or on its own terms.\\"Klady, L. (9 August 1987). \\"OUTTAKES\\".

The result was a landslide victory for the Thai Rak Thai party of Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, which won 375 of the 500 seats in the House of Representatives, with its former coalition partner, the Chart Thai Party taking 26 seats. The opposition Democrat Party of Thailand won only 96 seats and the newly formed Mahachon Party took three seats. Background Following the 2001 general elections, the New Aspiration Party merged into Thai Rak Thai, although it the NAP was later re-established by Chingchai Mongkoltham. The National Development Party (Thailand) and Liberal Democratic Party also merged with Thai Rak Thai Party. Electoral system At the time, the House of Representatives consisted of 400 members elected from single-member constituencies and 100 members elected from national party lists on a proportional basis. Campaign =Democrat Party= Democrat Party poster highlighting the \\"201\\" campaign The Democrat Party, led by Banyat Bantadtan, did not seriously expect to defeat the coalition of the other two parties, but hoped to win 200 seats, which would have been a gain of 70 seats. However, intra-party conflicts between Banyat's southern faction and the Bangkok faction led by Abhisit Vejjajiva made this goal appear even less realistic. The Democrats also developed a populist agenda, promising more jobs, free education and health care, and combating crime and corruption. However, the party refused to give details of their policies.Aurel Croissant and Daniel J. Pojar, Jr., Quo Vadis Thailand? Thai Politics after the 2005 Parliamentary Election , Strategic Insights, Volume IV, Issue 6 (June 2005) The TRT's landslide victory cast doubt over the future of both party leaders, and Banyat resigned as Democrat Party leader immediately after the election. Abhisit Vejjajiva, Banyat's successor, said: \\"It will take a long time to revive the party because we need to look four years ahead and consider how to stay in the hearts of the people.\\" =Thai Rak Thai= The Thai Rak Thai party was seeking to win an absolute majority in its own right, something no political party had ever achieved in Thailand at a genuinely free election. A coalition of other parties and civil society groups was formed to prevent this, arguing that Thaksin already had too much power and that giving him an absolute parliamentary majority would encourage what they alleged were his authoritarian tendencies. Prominent academic Kasem Sirisamphan, for example, accused Thaksin of running a \\"parliamentary dictatorship\\" and said that \\"people do not want a billionaire prime minister to further dominate the country and its politics.\\" Thaksin's party replied that it had provided Thailand with a stable, competent and corruption-free government, although critics said that corruption has actually increased under Thaksin's watch. Party spokesperson Suranand Vejjajiva said that Thais Love Thais was \\"the first party which could translate its populist policies into action. Its achievements and Mr Thaksin's vision give the party a clear edge and it will win an absolute majority,\\" he said. Promotion for Thaksin Shinawatra and his party on a Bangkok tuk-tuk (taxi) Thai politics tend to be regionally based. Thai Rak Thai is strongest in the north-east region (Isan), the poorest and most populated part of the country, where Thaksin's populist policies are most popular. TRT is also dominant in the north, since Thaksin was born in Chiang Mai and has directed much government spending to his home region. Thai Rak Thai is strong in the Chao Phraya valley as well, although the region has historically been a stronghold of Chart Thai, which still dominates in some of the central provinces. Voters in Bangkok, the wealthiest part of the country, are less predictable, but steady economic growth, goal-oriented campaign agendas like \\"Healthy Bangkok\\" and \\"10 new MRT lines across the capital\\", and the publicity Thaksin received after the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake was enough to swing the allegiance of the capital's middle-class to TRT. The Democrats are strongest in the south, but are popular among liberal-minded voters in Bangkok. During 2004 most observers suggested that Thaksin's popularity had declined since its peak in 2003, and that he was unlikely to achieve an absolute majority for his own party. The deaths of Muslim protesters in southern Thailand and the bird flu outbreak were seen as issues which the Thaksin government had handled poorly. An election poster for Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra in Bangkok, January 2005 =Tsunami effects= These calculations were upset by the disaster of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, which devastated six southern coastal provinces. The tsunami and its aftermath drove the election campaign to a large extent out of the media, and also produced a strong sense of national solidarity, from both of which an incumbent government could be expected to benefit. Most commentators praised the Thaksin government's response to the disaster. Political commentator Veera Prateepchaikul, who identified himself as an opponent of Thaksin, wrote in the Bangkok Post on 10 January: \\"Mr Thaksin deserves credit for his quick response to the disaster, his decisive leadership and his skills in crisis management.\\" Veera also pointed out that the provinces directly affected by the tsunami were part of the Democrat Party's southern stronghold, and that Thaksin's high profile, particularly on state television, in delivering aid to the area might improve his party's chances of winning more seats in the south. \\"The Democrats might cry foul that Mr Thaksin is using the state media for campaign purposes,\\" Veera wrote, \\"but the people may think otherwise.\\" Only a miracle, he wrote, could turn the \\"tsunami tide which is now clearly in favour of Mr Thaksin.\\" In the event the Democrats retained their dominance in southern Thailand, winning 50 of the 52 southern seats for which figures are available. Pre-election predictions Given such increased expectations, a failure by Thai Rak Thai to win 250 seats would have been seen as a considerable setback for Thaksin. The Bangkok newspaper The Nation published predictions by its reporters on 8 January, predicting that of the 400 constituency seats, Thai Rak Thai would win 233, the Democrats 94, Chart Thai 47 and Great People 26. If the parties achieved similar results in the 100 proportionate seats, this would have given Thais Love Thais about 290 seats overall and the Democrats about 120 seats. This proved to be a considerable underestimate of the scale of Thaksin's victory. Results Thaksin's party dominated most of Thailand's regions. In Bangkok it won 32 seats to the Democrats' four and Chart Thai's one. In the Central region it won 79 seats, to 10 for Chart Thai and eight for the Democrats. In the North, it won 70 seats to the Democrats' five. In the North-East (Isan) region, it won a massive 126 seats, to the Chart Thai's six, with two each going to the Democrats' the Mahachon Party. Only in the South was the landslide resisted. Democrats won 52 seats in their traditional stronghold, while Chart Thai and Thai Rak Thai won only one seat each. Of the 100 seats elected by proportional representation, Thais Love Thais appeared to be winning 67, to the Democrats' 25 and Chart Thai's eight. Thaksin said he would now form a one-party administration, ending his uneasy coalition with Chart Thai. The Bangkok newspaper The Nation said that Thaksin \\"has apparently won the strongest popular re-endorsement in Thai political history and is set to be the most powerful prime minister ever elected to lead the Kingdom.\\" Thaksin is the first democratically elected Prime Minister of Thailand to complete a full four-year term in office and the first to win an absolute majority in the House in a relatively free election. The day after the election, Thaksin said he would \\"work harder and faster to implement policies and resolve the country's problems.\\" He said the government would \\"quickly boost Thailand's competitiveness in the international market, and would also look into improving religious affairs issues.\\" This was taken as a reference to the situation in the south of the country, which has a large Muslim population, where there has been a history of unrest and disturbances, and where Thaksin's party won only one seat. The Nation newspaper reported: \\"Many voters [in the south] said they had lost faith in Thaksin, who has refused to apologise for incidents such as the deaths of 78 Muslims in October who were held in military custody after being arrested for protesting in the village of Tak Bai.\\" References *\\"Rivals battle to end Thaksin era,\\" Bangkok Post, 6 January 2005 *Veera Prateepchaikul, \\"Thaksin is swept along by the tsunami,\\" Bangkok Post, 10 January 2005  Literature  * External links *Elections under Thaksin - a rural perspective *Angus Reid Consultants - Election Tracker *The Nation's guide to the general election *Realtime vote-counting report *News about Thailand's 2005 General Election *Why Thaksin succeeds Elections in Thailand 2005 elections in Asia General election February 2005 events in Asia ","title":"2005 Thai general election"},{"id":"1367472","text":"Heinemann) The Midnight Folk is a children's fantasy novel by John Masefield first published in 1927. It is about a boy, Kay Harker, who sets out to discover what became of a fortune stolen from his seafaring great grandfather Aston Tirrold Harker (in reality, Aston Tirrold is a village in Oxfordshire). The treasure is also sought by a coven of witches who are seeking it for their own ends. Kay's governess Sylvia Daisy Pouncer is a member of the coven. The witches are led or guided by the wizard Abner Brown. Kay Harker is aided in his quest by various talking animals, most notably Nibbins the cat, who used to be a witch's cat but has reformed. There are two other household cats: the main antagonist is Blackmalkin, and he is aided by the mysterious Greymalkin who takes his name from the witch's familiar in the opening scene of Shakespeare's Macbeth. Kay Harker experiences various adventures‚Äîsailing on the high seas, swimming with mermaids, flying on broomsticks. At one point in the novel he manages to see into the past. Many maternal characters appear in the book; one takes Kay on a nocturnal ride on a magical horse. She then reappears at the end of the book as Caroline Louisa, Kay's new guardian. She tells Kay, \\"..I loved your mother...\\". It is possible that she represents Masefield's memory of his own mother who died when he was very young. Kay's toys (known as \\"the guards\\") have been taken away from him at the start of the book, apparently because they will remind him of his parents; there is a strong implication that Kay's parents are deceased. The guards play little part in the main narrative but have a critical role in the final recovery of the treasure. The Midnight Folk is written as one piece. There are no chapter divisions. Division within the text is obtained by moving from prose to verse or even song in some places. Recurrences John Masefield threaded a number of common themes through a series of his books; even those novels aimed at children shared places, people and storylines with some of his adult novels. One key recurring theme is the nautical visit of a member of the Harker family to the fictional islands of Santa Barbara. In The Midnight Folk, Kay's great-grandfather is endowed with a great treasure there; in other novels the actual nature of the seafaring Harker's relationship to Kay is less clear. A great many incidental characters and places are shared across Masefield's novels, although the fine details of such recurrences are often contradictory from novel to novel. Several characters from the book make return appearances in the sequel The Box of Delights: *Kay Harker *Caroline Louisa is installed as Kay's guardian at the end of The Midnight Folk, having appeared earlier in the novel as one of Kay's supernatural helpers. She remains Kay's guardian throughout The Box of Delights. *Abner Brown is the principal villain in both novels, but plays a more prominent role in The Box of Delights. *Sylvia Daisy Pouncer dishonourably leaves her role as Kay's governess at the end of The Midnight Folk, only to return as Abner Brown's wife in The Box of Delights. *Ellen is the maid at Seekings House in both books. *Nibbins the cat has a large role in The Midnight Folk but a mere mention in The Box of Delights *The supernatural statue with powers of clairvoyance known as ‚ÄòHead‚Äô appears in both books. *The cellar rat appears to spy for the highest bidder. In The Midnight Folk, Kay pays for his services with sugar, raisins, bacon rind and (most appreciated by Rat) a \\"Naggy\\" (haggis). In The Box of Delights, Abner Brown buys information from him with rum and mouldy cheese. Reception Radio, Film, TV or theatrical adaptations There was a BBC radio adaptation of the book by John Keir Cross in 1958.

Biography  In 1953, at the age of 25, Leonov was posted to Mexico City, where he learned Spanish at the Autonomous University. In the course of the sea voyage, he met Ra√∫l Castro, who was returning from a European youth festival. On arrival in Mexico he took up a junior post in the Soviet embassy. In 1955, Leonov met Che Guevara in Mexico City through Ra√∫l Castro. Leonov violated embassy rules by visiting Guevara, who was fascinated with Soviet life. After answering some of Guevara's questions, Leonov gave him Soviet literature. When Guevara went to the embassy to pick up the books the two men talked again, the last time they talked in Mexico. Recalled to Moscow in November 1956, Leonov was discharged from the foreign service and deciding to pursue a career as a historian of Latin America, went to work as a translator for the official Soviet Spanish-language publishing house, Editorial Progreso. In the late summer of 1958, he was invited to join the KGB. On 1 September, he began a two-year intelligence training course, which was interrupted, according to him, by the Cuban Revolution. In October 1959 his superiors ordered him to leave his studies and accompany Anastas Mikoyan to Mexico. In February 1960, he accompanied Soviet Deputy Premier Anastas Mikoyan on his visit to Havana, where he renewed his contact with Guevara to whom he gave a precision marksman's pistol \\"on behalf of the Soviet people.\\" During the 1960s, he served as a senior KGB officer stationed in Mexico. During the October 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, he received regular reports from agents in Florida with respect to American military preparations. He felt sure at the time that a nuclear confrontation would not be the result of the crisis. He served as interpreter on Fidel Castro's visit to the Soviet Union in 1963. In 1968, Leonov was recalled to Moscow, where he became a senior analyst. A report compiled by his office in 1975 recognised the growing peril to the power of the Soviet Union in geopolitical terms, arguing that in keeping with the policy of the British Empire before it, the Soviet Union should limit the commitment of its resources to a few key areas from which its power could operate in a more selective fashion. The report suggested establishing a Soviet foothold on the Arabian Peninsula in \\"the most Marxist country\\" in the region, South Yemen. The report was returned to Leonov's office, without Andropov's signature of approval. In the late 1970s and the early 1980s he travelled frequently to Poland to assess the situation and reportedly told the head of the KGB Yuri Andropov, in a heated discussion, that the prospects of Polish socialism looked bleak. Between 1983 and January 1991, Leonov was Deputy Chief of the First Chief Directorate of the State Security Committee (KGB) of the Soviet Union, the second post within the KGB structure. Previously he was Sub-Director of the KGB‚Äôs Analysis and Information Department (1973-1982) and Sub-Director of its Latin American Department (1968-1972). Leonov received a doctorate in Latin American History, from the USSR Academy of Sciences, and wrote the book Essays on Contemporary Central American History (Moscow: Academy of Sciences, 1973). In 1985, he published his memoirs under the title Difficult Times. As of 1998, he was a professor at the Institute of International Relations in Moscow. In December 2003, Leonov was elected to the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament, as a member of the nationalist Rodina party. He is closely identified with the current Kremlin administration and is a long-time friend and mentor of his former KGB subordinate, President Vladimir Putin.

The film marked the second time that Phoenix and Plimpton played romantic interests, having co-starred in the film The Mosquito Coast two years earlier. Plot Parents Annie and Arthur Pope are on the run as they were responsible for the anti-war protest bombing of a napalm laboratory in the 1970s. The incident accidentally blinded and paralyzed a janitor who wasn't supposed to be there. They've been on the run ever since, relying on an underground network of supporters who help them financially. At the time of the incident, their son Danny was two years old. As the film begins, he is in his late teens, and the family, now with younger son Harry, are again relocating and assuming new identities. Danny's overwhelming talent as a pianist catches the attention of his music teacher at school. The teacher begins to pry into Danny's personal life, particularly questioning why records from his previous school are unobtainable. While he pushes Danny to audition for Juilliard, Danny also falls in love with Lorna, the teacher's teenage daughter. As the pressure to have his own life and realize his own dreams intensifies, Danny reveals his family secret to Lorna. Meanwhile, Annie finds out about Danny's audition and begins to come to terms with the fact that she must let her son go and find his own way. This does not sit well with Arthur even as Annie risks their safety to contact her estranged father and arrange a home and life for Danny if they should decide to leave him behind. When Arthur hears on the radio that one of their underground colleagues has been shot and killed running from the authorities, he realizes that it is better for his son to pursue his dreams than to continue living a dangerous life on the run from crimes for which Danny bears no responsibility. The family leaves Danny behind and heads off for their next identity in a new town.

Active since 1989, Cape is best known as the frontman of the California punk rock band Lagwagon. Cape released his first solo album, Bridge, on October 21, 2008 on Suburban Home Records. His second album Doesn't Play Well with Others, was self-released in February 2011, after he released each song on the album each month of 2010, collecting them all on CD and vinyl in the end of 2010. Biography In addition to his work with Lagwagon, he was the lead vocalist for the experimental band Bad Astronaut until they disbanded due to death of drummer Derrick Plourde and is also a guitarist in the cover band Me First and the Gimme Gimmes. Moreover, Joey Cape released two split albums with Tony Sly of No Use for a Name, featuring acoustic versions of Lagwagon and No Use For a Name songs. Both Cape and Sly also contributed one unreleased/new song to the split. Cape's was titled, 'Violet', a song written for his daughter of the same name. He has also contributed a song called 'Minus' for the album Protect: A Benefit for the National Association to Protect Children. In 1996, Cape created a record label called My Records that released its debut album, Nerf Herder's self-titled album. My Records is no longer in operation. From 1999 to 2000, Cape spent the hiatus of Lagwagon working on two side projects: Bad Astronaut and Me First and the Gimme Gimmes. This slowed down Cape's work on Lagwagon until 2002. Cape, with Lagwagon, later released Blaze in 2003 and Resolve in 2005, the latter being a tribute to Lagwagon / Bad Astronaut drummer Derrick Plourde, who took his own life in 2005. They released an EP, I Think My Older Brother Used to Listen to Lagwagon, on August 19, 2008 on Fat Wreck Chords. In October 2014, they released Hang. Cape has produced records by The Ataris, Ridel High, Nerf Herder and his own bands Lagwagon and Bad Astronaut. He is also involved in a project called Afterburner, working alongside fellow Bad Astronaut Todd Capps, as well as opening a solo Myspace page with new acoustic songs and demos. He has also written songs for and played guitar with a new band of old friends called The Playing Favorites, who recently released their first album titled I Remember When I Was Pretty. On October 21, 2008, Cape released his first solo acoustic record Bridge on Bad Taste Records in Europe, and on Suburban Home Records in the US. In August 2009, Cape announced that he was recording material for a second solo acoustic album, titled Doesn't Play Well with Others. In November of the same year, he performed 8 shows alongside Chuck Ragan, Jim Ward, Audra Mae, and Frank Turner as part of The Revival Tour. Cape's album was released throughout 2010, one track at a time, with one song being released by Cape in each month of the year, with the full album with all 12 tracks to be released in January 2011. The album was delayed a few times until it was released on June 1, 2011, on CD and vinyl. On April 25, 2011, Cape has revealed that he is working on a new band project called Joey Cape's Bad Loud and that he already recorded a full-length album with the band, to feature electric full-band renditions of acoustic songs from his two solo albums Bridge and Doesn't Play Well with Others. The band's debut self-titled album was released on June 9, 2011, on BandCamp. He is also the founder of One Week Records. A One Week Record is ten songs that are recorded in seven days. The records are produced in his home studio. The artist is invited to his house to eat, drink, sleep and record music for one week. Given the limited schedule, there is no time to overproduce.

Auctions, published July 14, 1989: \\"...Sam Wagstaff Jr., Mr. Mapplethorpe's longtime companion, who died of AIDS in 1987. Mr. Mapplethorpe died of AIDS in March.\\" Plot Longtime Companion chronicles the first years of the AIDS epidemic as seen through its impact on several gay men and the straight friend of one of them. The film is split into several sections identified by dates. =July 3, 1981= Willy (Campbell Scott), a personal trainer, and his friend John (Dermot Mulroney) are spending time with affluent gay couple David (Bruce Davison) and Sean (Mark Lamos) at their beach house on Fire Island for the 4th of July. Sean is a screenwriter for the popular daytime soap opera Other People and David comes from a blue blood background and has a large trust fund. Back in the city, Howard (Patrick Cassidy) is preparing to audition for Sean's soap. His boyfriend is Paul (John Dossett), a business executive and their next-door neighbor is Lisa (Mary-Louise Parker), an antiques dealer, whose childhood friend Fuzzy (Stephen Caffrey) is a lawyer who represents Howard. That morning, The New York Times publishes its first article about the rise of a new \\"gay cancer\\". The news spreads as friends call each other. Some are immediately concerned, others dismissive. Willy meets Fuzzy at a tea dance later in the afternoon and they begin a relationship. Howard lands the role. =April 30, 1982= John is the first among the group to be diagnosed with the new disease, contracting pneumonia. Howard is given script pages in which his character is slated to become the first openly gay character on daytime television. He is very concerned about typecasting, fearing that by playing gay he will not be offered other sorts of parts. Willy and Fuzzy move in together. John dies shortly after his admission to the hospital. =June 17, 1983= Willy, Fuzzy, Lisa, David, and Sean gather back on Fire Island with friends Michael and Bob to watch Howard's character come out on the soap opera. The group also discuss a sick neighbor who has become a pariah on the island. That evening, Sean and David argue over Sean's fears that he might be getting sick. =September 7, 1984= Paul is hospitalized with toxoplasmosis. Sean is also hospitalized. Willy visits Sean and is so terrified of becoming infected that he dons a surgical mask and protective gown and, when Sean kisses him on the neck, excuses himself to the bathroom to scrub the spot. Michael (Michael Schoeffling) is also visiting Sean, bringing with him homeopathic preparations and a book by Louise Hay. Howard visits Paul and breaks down sobbing. Paul tries to reassure and comfort him. =March 22, 1985= Sean has deteriorated to the point of dementia. David is helping with his writing and deceiving the studio into thinking that Sean is still able to work. Fuzzy tries to get Howard a movie role but the producer refuses to cast him because of the rumor that he has AIDS. The same rumor got him fired from his role on Other People. Paul is back in the hospital following a seizure. David takes Sean for a walk but has to take him home when Sean urinates in a fountain at a park. That night Willy catches Fuzzy checking himself for swollen glands and they talk about their fear of dying. \\"What do you think happens when we die?\\" Fuzzy asks. \\"We get to have sex again\\" is Willy's reply. =January 4, 1986= Sean has deteriorated to the point of near-catatonia and is in constant pain. He has to be strapped into his bed and has lost control of his bowels and bladder and has to wear adult diapers as a result. After sending Sean's nurse on an errand, David sits with Sean and tells him that it is all right to let go. Sean dies. Willy and Lisa come by to help David, and they pick out a suit for Sean to wear to be cremated. Fuzzy calls Gay Men's Health Crisis to find a funeral home. In a rare moment of levity, Lisa and Willy stumble across a slinky red dress in Sean's closet and consider giving it to the undertaker. Ultimately they decide against it, since \\"it needs a hat. A big Bea Lillie thing!\\" The four go to a Chinese restaurant to write Sean's obituary and include David as his \\"longtime companion\\". =May 16, 1987= David has died in his sleep, and this is the day of his memorial service. Bob (Brian Cousins) and Willy eulogize him. At the following reception, the friends recall a time when David tried on his sister's wedding dress, accidentally tripped, and fell down the stairs, still wearing it. =September 10, 1988= Fuzzy and Lisa are volunteering answering phones at GMHC. Willy is a \\"buddy\\" to a GMHC client, Alberto (Michael Carmine). Howard has been diagnosed with AIDS. Although it is not mentioned, the presumption is that Paul has died. Howard uses his remaining fame to raise money for AIDS causes by hosting a benefit which includes a performance by Finger Lakes Trio of the Village People song \\"YMCA\\" performed in a pastiche of chamber music style. =July 19, 1989= Willy, Fuzzy and Lisa walk along the beach. They talk about an upcoming ACT UP demonstration. They talk about remembering a time before AIDS and wonder about finding a cure. The film ends with a momentary fantasy sequence, with the friends and others lost to AIDS appearing with them on the beach, before they vanish again and the three are left to walk off the deserted beach while the song \\"Post-Mortem Bar\\", by Zane Campbell, plays on the soundtrack.

History Construction started in 1949 to house the rapidly growing Department of Veterans Affairs. The buildings were thus originally named the Veterans Memorial Buildings. They were designed by George Roper Gouinlock (son of architect George Wallace Gouinlock) and H.L. Allward and appears to be a stripped down Art Deco style. The National Capital Commission (NCC) in collaboration with Public Works and Government Services Canada erected a historical plaque: A memorial is dedicated to the memory of 1701 Men of the Canadian Bank of Commerce who served in the Great War. The buildings are located on the south side of Wellington Street, across the street from the Supreme Court of Canada Building. Lyon Street passes between the two buildings, but they are linked by the Memorial Arch. Between the two lanes of Lyon Street are gardens and a large stone relief carved by Ivan Mestrovic to honour those who fought in the Second World War. In the early 1980s, as part of Prime Minister Pierre Elliot Trudeau's plans to decentralize the federal government, Veterans Affairs' headquarters moved out of the East Memorial Building and into the Daniel J. MacDonald Building in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. Other departments have since moved in. Today the Department of Justice is headquartered in the East Building. Currently, West Memorial Building is vacant and in poor condition with plans for major renovations in the near future. 1 Some offices for the National Archives were also located in these buildings. Renovations The West Memorial Building will be renovated from 2019-2023 to restore it to a usable condition.

The tree grows to a height of with a trunk exceeding in diameter, and is buttressed at the base. It is dominant in lowland forest and wetlands throughout the North and South Islands. Trees can live for at least 600 years. The leaves are spirally arranged; on young plants, they are awl-shaped, 3 to 8 mm long, and twisted at the base to lie spread to the sides of the shoot in a flat plane; on mature trees, they are scale-like, 1 to 3 mm long, and placed all round the shoot. The cones are highly modified, with the cone scales swelling at maturity into an orange to red, fleshy, aril with a single apical seed 3 to 5 mm in diameter. The seeds are dispersed by birds, which eat the fleshy scale and pass the seeds in their droppings. Before extensive logging, trees of 80 m height were known. A specimen in Pirongia Forest Park in the Waikato region is often referred to as the tallest native tree in New Zealand at . \\"Features of Pirongia Forest Park\\", Department of Conservation This is however incorrect as the tree is only . The current tallest known kahikatea in New Zealand is actually a tall tree located near the Matirangi Forest in Taranaki. The tree was previously referred to by the misleading name \\"white pine\\", despite its not being a pine; the MƒÅori name kahikatea is now more widely used (other MƒÅori names are kaikatea, kahika, katea, k≈çaka, koroƒ´). Like many other species in the family Podocarpaceae, the classification of kahikatea has changed over time, having also been placed in the genera Podocarpus and Nageia. The Waikato still has small stands of natural Kahikatea. The most readily accessible is at Claudelands Bush in the Hamilton suburb of Claudelands which was previously a swamp. Arohaki Lagoon with Dacrycarpus dacrydioides in the background. cones and foliage. Uses The timber was initially not so highly regarded by European settlers as it was less attractive, strong, or resilient to rot than the other coniferous timbers available such as totara. However, since the wood does not impart an odour, and is clean and lightweight, Kahikatea was used to make boxes for the exporting of butter when the refrigerated export became feasible from Australia and New Zealand in the 1880s.Gymnosperm Database - Dacrycarpus dacrydioides The butter was exported in 56 lb slabs, and kahikatea became less common as the export industry grew. Indeed, tall mature pure kaihikatea forest, a once distinctive and widespread wetland type, is all but gone except for very small patches mostly on the West Coast. The first bridge in Hamilton across the Waikato River was built mainly of Kahikatea about 1880 but the bridge quickly became unsafe due to rot. The piles (not of Kahikatea) are still visible in the vegetation alongside the Traffic (Bridge St.) Bridge. Kahikatea was used for boat building up until the 1970s because of its long straight lengths. When 12% dry it is slightly lighter in weight than Kauri and white in colour. Kahikatea was also used as late as the 1980s to carve out waka, traditional vessels for Maori, in which they competed in various watersports in Kaituna Wetlands. For MƒÅori, the kahikatea had many uses. The fleshy aril or koroi was an important food resource, and was served at feasts in great amounts. The wood was also favoured for making bird spears. Soot obtained from burning the heartwood supplied a pigment for traditional tattooing (tƒÅ moko). Kahikatea, along with other trees in privately owned forests, can only be harvested under a permit system and if sustainable harvesting techniques are used. There are still a few old-growth remnants of kahikatea left in the Waikato (for example, at Mangapu and Mokau). However, most kahikatea stands in the Waikato lowlands are relatively young forest fragments, about 80‚Äì100 years old. These fragments have grown up around a few old trees left standing after most of the original forest was cleared for farming. Some stands still have their original seed trees around which the new forest grew. These massive trees, with trunks occasionally over 2 m across, are about 400-500 years old. There are about 370 kahikatea fragments in the Waikato region. They are typically small, between 0.5 and 50 ha, with half of them less than 5 ha. Most of them grow on the river floodplains of the Waikato Basin, Hauraki Plains and Mokau River. Because humans now control flood events and re-sow flood-damaged pasture, it is unlikely to see many new areas of kahikatea forest developing in the Waikato. Scientists estimate that more than 98 of percent of the pre-European kahikatea forest has been lost nationwide.

The plot is based on the true story of the 1994 trial of Byron De La Beckwith, the white supremacist accused of the 1963 assassination of civil rights activist Medgar Evers. James Woods was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role of Byron De La Beckwith. The original music score was composed by Marc Shaiman and the cinematography is by John Seale. Plot Medgar Evers was an African-American civil rights activist in Mississippi murdered on June 12, 1963. It was suspected that Byron De La Beckwith, a white supremacist, was the murderer. He had been tried twice and both trials ended in hung juries. In 1989, Evers' widow Myrlie, who had been trying to bring De La Beckwith to justice for over 25 years, believed she had what it takes to bring him to trial again. Although most of the evidence from the old trial had disappeared, Bobby DeLaughter, an assistant District Attorney, decided to help her despite being warned that it might hurt his political aspirations and despite the strain that it caused in his marriage. DeLaughter becomes primarily involved with bringing De La Beckwith to trial for the third time 30 years later. In 1994, Byron De La Beckwith was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment, giving justice to the family of Medgar Evers.

Starring John Travolta and Robert Duvall, it tells the true story of a court case about environmental pollution that took place in Woburn, Massachusetts in the 1980s. The film and court case revolve around the issue of trichloroethylene, an industrial solvent, and its contamination of a local aquifer. A lawsuit was filed over industrial operations that appeared to have caused fatal cases of leukemia and cancer, as well as a wide variety of other health problems, among the citizens of the city. The case involved is Anne Anderson, et al., v. Cryovac, Inc., et al.. The first reported decision in the case is at 96 F.R.D. 431 (denial of defendants' motion to dismiss). Duvall was nominated for an Oscar for his performance. Plot Environmental toxicants in the city of Woburn, Massachusetts contaminate the area's water supply and become linked to a number of deaths of local children. Cocky Boston attorney Jan Schlichtmann (John Travolta) and his small firm of personal injury lawyers are asked by Woburn resident Anne Anderson (Kathleen Quinlan) to take legal action against those responsible. After originally rejecting a seemingly unprofitable case, Jan finds a major environmental issue involving groundwater contamination that has great legal potential and realizes the local tanneries could be responsible for several deadly cases of leukemia. Jan decides to go forward against two giant corporations which own the tanneries Beatrice Foods and W. R. Grace and Company thinking that the case could possibly earn him millions and boost his firm's reputation. Bringing a class action lawsuit in federal court, Jan represents families who demand an apology and a clean-up of contaminated areas. However, the case develops a life of its own and takes over the lives of Jan and his firm. The lawyers for Beatrice and Grace are not easy to intimidate, a judge (John Lithgow) makes a key ruling against the plaintiffs, and soon Jan and his partners find themselves in a position where their professional and financial survival has been staked on the outcome of the case. Jan stubbornly declines settlement offers, gradually coming to believe that the case is about more than just money. He allows his pride to take over, making outrageous demands and deciding that he must win at all costs. Pressures take their toll, with Jan and his partners going deeply into debt. After a lengthy trial, the case is dismissed in favor of Beatrice, after Jan turned down an offer of $20 million from Beatrice attorney Jerry Facher (Robert Duvall) during jury deliberations. The plaintiffs are forced to accept a settlement with Grace that barely covers the expense involved in trying the case, leaving Jan and his partners broke. The families are deeply disappointed, and Jan's partners dissolve their partnership, effectively breaking up the firm. Jan ends up alone, living in a small apartment and running a small-time law practice. He manages to find the last key witness to the case, but lacks resources and courage to appeal the judgement. The files are archived while Jan later files for bankruptcy. A postscript reveals that the EPA, building on Jan's work on the case, later brought its own enforcement action against Beatrice and Grace, forcing them to pay millions to clean up the land and the groundwater. It takes Jan several years to settle his debts, and he now practices environmental law in New Jersey. =Differences from the book= The plotline has been greatly simplified from the book, e.g. later findings by the Environmental Protection Agency and its potential consequences that might have allowed the plaintiffs another trial against Beatrice, and which did ultimately lead to a conviction of perjury against John Riley, and improper conduct for Mary Ryan, are referred to only briefly in the epilogue. The characters Charles Nesson, Mark Phillips, Rikki Klieman, Teresa Padro and others have been removed from the film version, as well as the plot points that they contribute.

Production methods  There are two methods for producing baby corn either as a primary crop or as a secondary crop in a planting of sweet corn or field corn. In the first method, a seed variety is chosen and planted to produce only baby corn. Many varieties are suitable, but those developed specifically for baby corn tend to produce more ears per plant. In the second production method, the variety is selected to produce sweet or field corn. The second ear from the top of the plant is harvested for baby corn, while the top ear is allowed to mature. Baby corn ears are hand-picked as soon as the corn silks emerge from the ear tips, or a few days after. Corn generally matures very quickly, so the harvest of baby corn must be timed carefully to avoid ending up with more mature corn ears. Baby corn ears are typically in length and in diameter.

It was inaugurated on August 6, 1966. It is often compared to the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, US, because they are both suspension bridges of similar color. It was built by the American Bridge Company which constructed the San Francisco‚ÄìOakland Bay Bridge, but not the Golden Gate. With a total length of , it is the 40th largest suspension bridge in the world. The upper deck carries six car lanes, while the lower deck carries a double track railway electrified at 25 kV AC; the train platform was added in 1999. From 1966-1974, the bridge was named Salazar Bridge () in honor of Portuguese Prime Minister Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar, who ordered its construction. After the Carnation Revolution which overthrew the remnants of Salazar's dictatorship, the bridge was renamed for April 25, the date of the revolution. It is also sometimes called the Tagus River Bridge or in Portuguese Ponte sobre o Tejo (\\"bridge over the Tagus\\"). History = Construction = From the late 19th century, there had been proposals to build a bridge for Lisbon. In 1929, the idea advanced as a Portuguese engineer and entrepreneur, Ant√≥nio Bello requested a Government concession for a railway crossing between Lisbon and Montijo (where the Vasco da Gama Bridge, the second bridge serving Lisbon, was later built in 1998). As a result, the Minister of Public Works, Duarte Pacheco, created a commission in 1933 to analyse the request. The commission reported in 1934, and proposed building a road and rail bridge. Bids were obtained. However, this proposal was subsequently put aside in favour of a bridge crossing the river at Vila Franca de Xira, north of Lisbon. In 1953, a new Government commission started working and recommended building the bridge in 1958, choosing the southern anchor point adjacent to the recently built monument to Christ the King (Cristo-Rei). In 1959 the international invitation to tender for the project received four bids. In 1960, the winner was announced as a consortium headed by the United States Steel Export Company, which had submitted a bid in 1935. The American School of Lisbon was founded at this time to educate the children of the American engineers brought to Portugal to work on the bridge's construction. Construction began on 5 November 1962. Forty-five months later (six months ahead of schedule) the bridge was inaugurated on 6 August 1966. Presiding at the ceremony was the President of Portugal, Admiral Am√©rico Thomaz. Also present were the Prime-Minister, Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar, and the Patriarch of Lisbon, Cardinal Manuel Gon√ßalves Cerejeira. The bridge was named Salazar Bridge (Ponte Salazar), for Prime Minister Salazar.\\"Use of Special Techniques in Refurbishment\\", by J-P. Muzeau, in Refurbishment of Buildings and Bridges (Springer, 2014) p305 United States Steel International, Inc. based in New York, was prime contractor for the bridge. Morrison-Knudsen of Portugal, Ltd., an American firm based in Boise, Idaho was U.S. Steel's principal associate. Morrison-Knudsen had previously worked on the San Francisco Bay Bridge. Steinman, Boynton, Gronquist and London of New York, and Tudor Engineering Company of San Francisco designed the bridge.Morrison, H.W. ‚ÄúChairman‚Äôs Memo: Bridge Opens New Vistas for Portugal.‚Äù The Em Kayan, October 1966. The steel was imported from the US. Four workers lost their lives, out of a total of 3,000 who worked on the site. Construction took a total of 2,185,000 man-hours of work. The total cost of the bridge came to 2.2 billion Portuguese escudos, or US$32 million (US$225 million in 2011 adjusted for inflation). Soon after the Carnation Revolution in 1974, the bridge was renamed the 25 de Abril Bridge, the day the revolution had occurred. A symbol of those times was captured on film, with citizens removing the big \\"Salazar\\" brass sign from one of the main pillars of the bridge and painting a provisional \\"25 de Abril\\" in its place. =Expansion= Sound of cars driving on 25 de Abril bridge The upper platform, running above water, started carrying 4 car lanes, two in each direction, with a dividing guardrail. On 23 July 1990, this guardrail was removed and a fifth, reversible lane was created. On 6 November 1998, the side walls were extended and reinforced to make space for the present six lanes. Cars crossing the bridge make a peculiar hum - listen (59s) - as the two inner lanes are relatively slippery metallic platforms instead of asphalt. Since 30 June 1999, the lower platform has carried a double track railway. To accommodate this, the bridge underwent extensive structural reinforcements, including a second set of main cables, placed above the original set, and the main towers were increased in height. The railway had been part of the initial design, but was eliminated for economy, so the initial structure was lightened. The original builder American Bridge Company was called again for the job, performing the first aerial spinning of additional main cables on a loaded, fully operational suspension bridge. Traffic soon increased well beyond predictions, and has remained at maximum capacity despite the enlargement from four to six lanes, the addition of the railway, and the building of a second bridge serving Lisbon, the Vasco da Gama Bridge. A third bridge has been on and off Government plans for some time, presently the plan has been dropped due to Portugal's budget constraints. Popular culture Several movies have been filmed on the bridge, including some scenes in the 1969 James Bond film On Her Majesty's Secret Service when James Bond is in a car with Marc Ange Draco's henchmen and they drive across a bridge, and the bridge is featured near the end of the movie when Bond marries Tracy and drives with her in Bond's Aston Martin across the bridge again. Normally, pedestrians cannot walk across the bridge, but every year there is a half- marathon that starts on the south bank and finishes in the north bank (Belem). In September 2017 an observation deck was built allowing people to go to the platform. Tolls Sanctuary of Christ the King and Almada. The bridge was projected to have paid all debt in 20 years, and to become toll-free (or reduced toll) after that period. However, the Government kept charging tolls well beyond the 20-year period, until it gave the concession to Lusoponte, creating a monopoly of the Tagus crossing in Lisbon. As such, the bridge has always required a toll, first in both directions and from 1993 northbound only, with the toll plaza situated on the south bank of the Tagus river. The tolls have become a source of political dispute in recent years. When opened, one had to park their car and walk to buy the toll ticket costing 20 escudos. On 14 June 1994, the Government, which ran the bridge at the time, raised the toll by 50% (100 to 150 escudos), to prepare to give the bridge into private concession for 40 years from 1 January 1996. The concessionaire was Lusoponte, a private consortium formed to build the Vasco da Gama Bridge at no cost to the public finances in exchange for tolls from both bridges. As a result, a popular uprising led to road blockades of the bridge and consequent police charges, an event which made the then right-wing Government highly unpopular and which many believe led to a centre-left win in the 1995 general elections. The toll is set at ‚Ç¨1.85 for passenger cars (), northbound (into Lisbon). There is no toll southbound, and until 2010, no tolls were collected during the month of August. From 2011 on, the Portuguese Government abolished this exception and ordered tolls to be charged also during this month, in order to help the efforts to reduce the budget deficit. Assuming that no legal changes happen in between, the concession will end on 24 March 2030, after which the Bridge will again be State-managed. Design The 25 de Abril Bridge at night. The 25 de Abril Bridge is based in part on two San Francisco Bay Area bridges: its paint is the same International Orange as the famous Golden Gate Bridge; and its design is similar to that of the San Francisco‚ÄìOakland Bay Bridge. Both the Bay Bridge and the 25 de Abril Bridge were built by the same company. The American Society of Civil Engineers says that \\"Like its sister bridge, the SFOBB in San Francisco, the Tagus River Bridge is located in an area with a long history of earthquakes\\" and seismic data had to be taken into account in its construction. Another sister bridge is the Forth Road Bridge in Edinburgh. Upon completion, the bridge had the longest suspended span and the longest main span in Continental Europe, the world's longest continuous truss, and the world's deepest bridge foundation. It was the fifth-largest suspension bridge in the world, the largest outside the US. Today it is the 40th largest suspension bridge in the world. Numbers a daily average of 150,000 cars cross the bridge, including 7,000 on the peak hour. Rail traffic is also heavy, with a daily average of 157 trains. In all, around 380,000 people cross the bridge daily (190,000 if considering return trips).

Elemental analysis can be qualitative (determining what elements are present), and it can be quantitative (determining how much of each are present). Elemental analysis falls within the ambit of analytical chemistry, the set of instruments involved in deciphering the chemical nature of our world. Elemental Analysis Laboratory History Antoine Lavoisier is regarded as the inventor of elemental analysis as a quantitative, experimental tool to assess the chemical composition of a compound. At the time elemental analysis was based on gravimetric determination of specific adsorbant materials before and after selective adsorption of the combustion gases. Today fully automated systems based on thermal conductivity or infrared spectroscopy detection of the combustion gases, or other spectroscopic methods are used. CHNX analysis For organic chemists, elemental analysis or \\"EA\\" almost always refers to CHNX analysis‚Äîthe determination of the mass fractions of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and heteroatoms (X) (halogens, sulfur) of a sample. This information is important to help determine the structure of an unknown compound, as well as to help ascertain the structure and purity of a synthesized compound. In present day organic chemistry spectroscopic technics (NMR, both 1H and 13C), mass spectrometry and chromatographic procedures have replaced EA as the primary technique for structural determination, although it still gives very useful complementary information. It is also the fastest and most inexpensive method to determine sample purity. Elemental Analyzer System The most common form of elemental analysis, CHNS analysis, is accomplished by combustion analysis. Modern elemental analyzers are also capable of simultaneous determination of sulfur along with CHN in the same measurement run. Quantitative analysis Quantitative analysis is the determination of the mass of each element or compound present.From Columbia Encyclopedia on answers.com: http://www.answers.com/library/Columbia+Encyclopedia-cid-2284496: chemical analysis Other quantitative methods include gravimetry, optical atomic spectroscopy, and neutron activation analysis. Gravimetry is where the sample is dissolved and then the element of interest is precipitated and its mass measured or the element of interest is volatilized and the mass loss is measured. Optical atomic spectroscopy includes flame atomic absorption, graphite furnace atomic absorption, and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy, which probe the outer electronic structure of atoms. Neutron activation analysis involves the activation of a sample matrix through the process of neutron capture. The resulting radioactive target nuclei of the sample begin to decay, emitting gamma rays of specific energies that identify the radioisotopes present in the sample. The concentration of each analyte can be determined by comparison to an irradiated standard with known concentrations of each analyte. Qualitative analysis To qualitatively determine which elements exist in a sample, the methods are mass spectrometric atomic spectroscopy, such as inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, which probes the mass of atoms; other spectroscopy which probes the inner electronic structure of atoms such as X-ray fluorescence, particle-induced X-ray emission, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Auger electron spectroscopy; and chemical methods such as the sodium fusion test and Sch√∂niger oxidation. Analysis of results The analysis of results is performed by determining the ratio of elements from within the sample, and working out a chemical formula that fits with those results. This process is useful as it helps determine if a sample sent is a desired compound and confirms the purity of a compound. The accepted deviation of elemental analysis results from the calculated is 0.3%.

His son Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar II followed him into law and was appointed from Mississippi as a U.S. Supreme Court Justice. Early life and education Lucius was the first son in his family, and born on his father's plantation in Milledgeville, Georgia, where he grew up. His parents, John and Rebecca (Lamar) Lamar had allowed his mother's brother to name their sons; he named them after his favorite historical heroes. Lamar was named for the Roman statesman Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus. His younger brother was Mirabeau Buonaparte Lamar. He became known for fighting for the independence of the Republic of Texas and was elected as its second president. Their family was well-connected in Georgia and the South; first cousins Gazaway Bugg Lamar and his brother G. W. became bankers in Augusta, Savannah, and New York City. L.Q.C.Lamar II Lucius Lamar studied law at Milledgeville, Georgia, and at Litchfield Law School in Litchfield, Connecticut. He was admitted to the Georgia bar in 1819. He set up his practice in his hometown of Milledgeville. After getting established, he married and started a family. Law career Lamar revised Augustin Smith Clayton's Georgia Justice about 1819. He was commissioned by the legislature to compile The Laws of Georgia from 1810 to 1819 (Augusta, 1821). He gained respect as an attorney. In 1830, Lamar was elected as judge of the Superior Court, succeeding Thomas W. Cobb. In 1834, he committed suicide by gunshot.

Biography He was born on Tuesday, 9 March 1880 at his maternal uncle's house at Baje Pratappur in Hooghly district of West Bengal. His pre- monastic name was Amritalal Sengupta. His father Navinkrishna Sengupta was an engineer. Due to his posting at various places, Amritalal had to move about frequently, with the family. Swami Sadananda, the first monastic disciple of Swamiji, was his distantly-related maternal uncle in his pre-monastic life. As a child Amritalal had a glimpse of Swami Vivekananda after his return from the West. From his childhood, Amritalal was very energetic, yet possessed a gentle disposition. His gentleness developed remarkably in his monastic life. He left home in 1902 and joined at the Belur Math. He was initiated by Swami Brahmananda who had developed great liking for the boy and fondly called him Amulya, meaning 'precious'. Eventually, he became popular as Amulya Maharaj. Amulya was initiated into sannyasa by Swami Brahmananda in 1906. He served his guru as his attendant. He moulded his life under the active guidance of Swami Brahmananda. Amulya's visits to various places in India with Sister Nivedita and a visit to Japan with Swami Sadananda, helped him to gather educative experiences related to culture, religion and architecture. He was instrumental in building the monastery at Bhubaneswar, under the guidance of Swami Brahmananda. Many important temples like the temples of the Holy Mother and Swami Brahmananda were later built under his supervision. Swami Shankarananda was austere and meditative by nature and took up spiritual discipline at places like Darjeeling, Bhubaneswar, Puri and other places. Swami Shankarananda became a Trustee of the Ramakrishna Math and a member of the Governing Body of the Ramakrishna Mission, in 1910. He served as one of the Joint Secretaries of the Order since 1929 and later became its Treasurer in 1938. For brief periods he served as the head of the Bhubaneswar Centre and also of the Delhi Centre of the Order. In 1947, he became a Vice President of the Order. After the death of Swami Virajananda, the mantle of the office of Presidency fell on Swami Shankarananda on 19 June 1951. He was a man of few words and outwardly maintained a stern appearance, but had motherly love and concern for all. His tenure as the President of the Order was marked by the consolidation of the Ramakrishna Movement in various parts of the country. Sarada Math During the Presidency of Swami Shankarananda an independent monastic Order for the nuns, known as the Sarada Math, was created, the birth centenary celebration of the Holy Mother was conducted successfully, and a seminary for the novice monks called the Probationers' Training Centre was founded under him, at the Belur Math. On Saturday 13 January 1962 Swami Shankarananda is deemed at his death to have entered into MahasamƒÅdhi at the Belur Math, at the age of 81.

Monitors also have a mechanism for signaling other threads that their condition has been met. A monitor consists of a mutex (lock) object and condition variables. A condition variable essentially is a container of threads that are waiting for a certain condition. Monitors provide a mechanism for threads to temporarily give up exclusive access in order to wait for some condition to be met, before regaining exclusive access and resuming their task. Another definition of monitor is a thread-safe class, object, or module that wraps around a mutex in order to safely allow access to a method or variable by more than one thread. The defining characteristic of a monitor is that its methods are executed with mutual exclusion: At each point in time, at most one thread may be executing any of its methods. By using one or more condition variables it can also provide the ability for threads to wait on a certain condition (thus using the above definition of a \\"monitor\\"). For the rest of this article, this sense of \\"monitor\\" will be referred to as a \\"thread-safe object/class/module\\". Monitors were invented by Per Brinch Hansen and C. A. R. Hoare, and were first implemented in Brinch Hansen's Concurrent Pascal language. Mutual exclusion As a simple example, consider a thread- safe object for performing transactions on a bank account: monitor class Account { private int balance := 0 invariant balance >= 0 public method boolean withdraw(int amount) precondition amount >= 0 { if balance < amount { return false } else { balance := balance - amount return true } } public method deposit(int amount) precondition amount >= 0 { balance := balance + amount } } While a thread is executing a method of a thread-safe object, it is said to occupy the object, by holding its mutex (lock). Thread-safe objects are implemented to enforce that at each point in time, at most one thread may occupy the object. The lock, which is initially unlocked, is locked at the start of each public method, and is unlocked at each return from each public method. Upon calling one of the methods, a thread must wait until no other thread is executing any of the thread-safe object's methods before starting execution of its method. Note that without this mutual exclusion, in the present example, two threads could cause money to be lost or gained for no reason. For example, two threads withdrawing 1000 from the account could both return true, while causing the balance to drop by only 1000, as follows: first, both threads fetch the current balance, find it greater than 1000, and subtract 1000 from it; then, both threads store the balance and return. The syntactic sugar \\"monitor class\\" in the above example is implementing the following basic representation of the code, by wrapping each function's execution in mutexes: class Account { private lock myLock private int balance := 0 invariant balance >= 0 public method boolean withdraw(int amount) precondition amount >= 0 { myLock.acquire() try { if balance < amount { return false } else { balance := balance - amount return true } } finally { myLock.release() } } public method deposit(int amount) precondition amount >= 0 { myLock.acquire() try { balance := balance + amount } finally { myLock.release() } } } Condition variables =Problem statement= For many applications, mutual exclusion is not enough. Threads attempting an operation may need to wait until some condition holds true. A busy waiting loop while not( ) do skip will not work, as mutual exclusion will prevent any other thread from entering the monitor to make the condition true. Other \\"solutions\\" exist such as having a loop that unlocks the monitor, waits a certain amount of time, locks the monitor and check for the condition . Theoretically, it works and will not deadlock, but issues arise. It's hard to decide an appropriate amount of waiting time, too small and the thread will hog the CPU, too big and it will be apparently unresponsive. What is needed is a way to signal the thread when the condition P is true (or could be true). =Case study: classic bounded producer/consumer problem= A classic concurrency problem is that of the bounded producer/consumer, in which there is a queue or ring buffer of tasks with a maximum size, with one or more threads being \\"producer\\" threads that add tasks to the queue, and one or more other threads being \\"consumer\\" threads that take tasks out of the queue. The queue is assumed to be non‚Äìthread-safe itself, and it can be empty, full, or between empty and full. Whenever the queue is full of tasks, then we need the producer threads to block until there is room from consumer threads dequeueing tasks. On the other hand, whenever the queue is empty, then we need the consumer threads to block until more tasks are available due to producer threads adding them. As the queue is a concurrent object shared between threads, accesses to it must be made atomic, because the queue can be put into an inconsistent state during the course of the queue access that should never be exposed between threads. Thus, any code that accesses the queue constitutes a critical section that must be synchronized by mutual exclusion. If code and processor instructions in critical sections of code that access the queue could be interleaved by arbitrary context switches between threads on the same processor or by simultaneously-running threads on multiple processors, then there is a risk of exposing inconsistent state and causing race conditions. Incorrect without synchronization A na√Øve approach is to design the code with busy-waiting and no synchronization, making the code subject to race conditions: global RingBuffer queue; // A thread-unsafe ring-buffer of tasks. // Method representing each producer thread's behavior: public method producer() { while (true) { task myTask = ...; // Producer makes some new task to be added. while (queue.isFull()) {} // Busy-wait until the queue is non- full. queue.enqueue(myTask); // Add the task to the queue. } } // Method representing each consumer thread's behavior: public method consumer() { while (true) { while (queue.isEmpty()) {} // Busy-wait until the queue is non-empty. myTask = queue.dequeue(); // Take a task off of the queue. doStuff(myTask); // Go off and do something with the task. } } This code has a serious problem in that accesses to the queue can be interrupted and interleaved with other threads' accesses to the queue. The queue.enqueue and queue.dequeue methods likely have instructions to update the queue's member variables such as its size, beginning and ending positions, assignment and allocation of queue elements, etc. In addition, the queue.isEmpty() and queue.isFull() methods read this shared state as well. If producer/consumer threads are allowed to be interleaved during the calls to enqueue/dequeue, then inconsistent state of the queue can be exposed leading to race conditions. In addition, if one consumer makes the queue empty in-between another consumer's exiting the busy- wait and calling \\"dequeue\\", then the second consumer will attempt to dequeue from an empty queue leading to an error. Likewise, if a producer makes the queue full in-between another producer's exiting the busy-wait and calling \\"enqueue\\", then the second producer will attempt to add to a full queue leading to an error. Spin-waiting One naive approach to achieve synchronization, as alluded to above, is to use \\"spin-waiting\\", in which a mutex is used to protect the critical sections of code and busy-waiting is still used, with the lock being acquired and released in between each busy- wait check. global RingBuffer queue; // A thread-unsafe ring-buffer of tasks. global Lock queueLock; // A mutex for the ring-buffer of tasks. // Method representing each producer thread's behavior: public method producer() { while (true) { task myTask = ...; // Producer makes some new task to be added. queueLock.acquire(); // Acquire lock for initial busy-wait check. while (queue.isFull()) { // Busy-wait until the queue is non-full. queueLock.release(); // Drop the lock temporarily to allow a chance for other threads // needing queueLock to run so that a consumer might take a task. queueLock.acquire(); // Re-acquire the lock for the next call to \\"queue.isFull()\\". } queue.enqueue(myTask); // Add the task to the queue. queueLock.release(); // Drop the queue lock until we need it again to add the next task. } } // Method representing each consumer thread's behavior: public method consumer() { while (true) { queueLock.acquire(); // Acquire lock for initial busy-wait check. while (queue.isEmpty()) { // Busy-wait until the queue is non-empty. queueLock.release(); // Drop the lock temporarily to allow a chance for other threads // needing queueLock to run so that a producer might add a task. queueLock.acquire(); // Re-acquire the lock for the next call to \\"queue.isEmpty()\\". } myTask = queue.dequeue(); // Take a task off of the queue. queueLock.release(); // Drop the queue lock until we need it again to take off the next task. doStuff(myTask); // Go off and do something with the task. } } This method assures that an inconsistent state does not occur, but wastes CPU resources due to the unnecessary busy-waiting. Even if the queue is empty and producer threads have nothing to add for a long time, consumer threads are always busy-waiting unnecessarily. Likewise, even if consumers are blocked for a long time on processing their current tasks and the queue is full, producers are always busy-waiting. This is a wasteful mechanism. What is needed is a way to make producer threads block until the queue is non-full, and a way to make consumer threads block until the queue is non-empty. (N.B.: Mutexes themselves can also be spin-locks which involve busy-waiting in order to get the lock, but in order to solve this problem of wasted CPU resources, we assume that queueLock is not a spin-lock and properly uses a blocking lock queue itself.) =Condition variables= The solution is to use condition variables. Conceptually a condition variable is a queue of threads, associated with a monitor, on which a thread may wait for some condition to become true. Thus each condition variable is associated with an assertion . While a thread is waiting on a condition variable, that thread is not considered to occupy the monitor, and so other threads may enter the monitor to change the monitor's state. In most types of monitors, these other threads may signal the condition variable to indicate that assertion is true in the current state. Thus there are three main operations on condition variables: * \`wait c, m\`, where \`c\` is a condition variable and \`m\` is a mutex (lock) associated with the monitor. This operation is called by a thread that needs to wait until the assertion is true before proceeding. While the thread is waiting, it does not occupy the monitor. The function, and fundamental contract, of the \\"wait\\" operation, is to do the following steps: *# Atomically: *#: *# Once this thread is subsequently notified/signalled (see below) and resumed, then automatically re-acquire the mutex \`m\`. *:Steps 1a and 1b can occur in either order, with 1c usually occurring after them. While the thread is sleeping and in \`c\`'s wait-queue, the next program counter to be executed is at step 2, in the middle of the \\"wait\\" function/subroutine. Thus, the thread sleeps and later wakes up in the middle of the \\"wait\\" operation. *:The atomicity of the operations within step 1 is important to avoid race conditions that would be caused by a preemptive thread switch in-between them. One failure mode that could occur if these were not atomic is a missed wakeup, in which the thread could be on \`c\`'s sleep-queue and have released the mutex, but a preemptive thread switch occurred before the thread went to sleep, and another thread called a signal/notify operation (see below) on \`c\` moving the first thread back out of \`c\`'s queue. As soon as the first thread in question is switched back to, its program counter will be at step 1c, and it will sleep and be unable to be woken up again, violating the invariant that it should have been on \`c\`'s sleep-queue when it slept. Other race conditions depend on the ordering of steps 1a and 1b, and depend on where a context switch occurs. * \`signal c\`, also known as \`notify c\`, is called by a thread to indicate that the assertion is true. Depending on the type and implementation of the monitor, this moves one or more threads from \`c\`'s sleep-queue to the \\"ready queue\\" or another queues for it to be executed. It is usually considered a best practice to perform the \\"signal\\"/\\"notify\\" operation before releasing mutex \`m\` that is associated with \`c\`, but as long as the code is properly designed for concurrency and depending on the threading implementation, it is often also acceptable to release the lock before signalling. Depending on the threading implementation, the ordering of this can have scheduling-priority ramifications. (Some authors instead advocate a preference for releasing the lock before signalling.) A threading implementation should document any special constraints on this ordering. * \`broadcast c\`, also known as \`notifyAll c\`, is a similar operation that wakes up all threads in c's wait- queue. This empties the wait-queue. Generally, when more than one predicate condition is associated with the same condition variable, the application will require broadcast instead of signal because a thread waiting for the wrong condition might be woken up and then immediately go back to sleep without waking up a thread waiting for the correct condition that just became true. Otherwise, if the predicate condition is one-to-one with the condition variable associated with it, then signal may be more efficient than broadcast. As a design rule, multiple condition variables can be associated with the same mutex, but not vice versa. (This is a one-to-many correspondence.) This is because the predicate is the same for all threads using the monitor and must be protected with mutual exclusion from all other threads that might cause the condition to be changed or that might read it while the thread in question causes it to be changed, but there may be different threads that want to wait for a different condition on the same variable requiring the same mutex to be used. In the producer-consumer example described above, the queue must be protected by a unique mutex object, \`m\`. The \\"producer\\" threads will want to wait on a monitor using lock \`m\` and a condition variable c_{full} which blocks until the queue is non-full. The \\"consumer\\" threads will want to wait on a different monitor using the same mutex \`m\` but a different condition variable c_{empty} which blocks until the queue is non-empty. It would (usually) never make sense to have different mutexes for the same condition variable, but this classic example shows why it often certainly makes sense to have multiple condition variables using the same mutex. A mutex used by one or more condition variables (one or more monitors) may also be shared with code that does not use condition variables (and which simply acquires/releases it without any wait/signal operations), if those critical sections do not happen to require waiting for a certain condition on the concurrent data. = Monitor usage = The proper basic usage of a monitor is: acquire(m); // Acquire this monitor's lock. while (!p) { // While the condition/predicate/assertion that we are waiting for is not true... wait(m, cv); // Wait on this monitor's lock and condition variable. } // ... Critical section of code goes here ... signal(cv2); -- OR -- notifyAll(cv2); // cv2 might be the same as cv or different. release(m); // Release this monitor's lock. To be more precise, this is the same pseudocode but with more verbose comments to better explain what is going on: // ... (previous code) // About to enter the monitor. // Acquire the advisory mutex (lock) associated with the concurrent // data that is shared between threads, // to ensure that no two threads can be preemptively interleaved or // run simultaneously on different cores while executing in critical // sections that read or write this same concurrent data. If another // thread is holding this mutex, then this thread will be put to sleep // (blocked) and placed on m's sleep queue. (Mutex \\"m\\" shall not be // a spin-lock.) acquire(m); // Now, we are holding the lock and can check the condition for the // first time. // The first time we execute the while loop condition after the above // \\"acquire\\", we are asking, \\"Does the condition/predicate/assertion // we are waiting for happen to already be true?\\" while (!p()) // \\"p\\" is any expression (e.g. variable or // function- call) that checks the condition and // evaluates to boolean. This itself is a critical // section, so you *MUST* be holding the lock when // executing this \\"while\\" loop condition! // If this is not the first time the \\"while\\" condition is being checked, // then we are asking the question, \\"Now that another thread using this // monitor has notified me and woken me up and I have been context- switched // back to, did the condition/predicate/assertion we are waiting on stay // true between the time that I was woken up and the time that I re- acquired // the lock inside the \\"wait\\" call in the last iteration of this loop, or // did some other thread cause the condition to become false again in the // meantime thus making this a spurious wakeup? { // If this is the first iteration of the loop, then the answer is // \\"no\\" -- the condition is not ready yet. Otherwise, the answer is: // the latter. This was a spurious wakeup, some other thread occurred // first and caused the condition to become false again, and we must // wait again. wait(m, cv); // Temporarily prevent any other thread on any core from doing // operations on m or cv. // release(m) // Atomically release lock \\"m\\" so other // // code using this concurrent data // // can operate, move this thread to cv's // // wait-queue so that it will be notified // // sometime when the condition becomes // // true, and sleep this thread. Re-enable // // other threads and cores to do // // operations on m and cv. // // Context switch occurs on this core. // // At some future time, the condition we are waiting for becomes // true, and another thread using this monitor (m, cv) does either // a signal/notify that happens to wake this thread up, or a // notifyAll that wakes us up, meaning that we have been taken out // of cv's wait-queue. // // During this time, other threads may cause the condition to // become false again, or the condition may toggle one or more // times, or it may happen to stay true. // // This thread is switched back to on some core. // // acquire(m) // Lock \\"m\\" is re-acquired. // End this loop iteration and re-check the \\"while\\" loop condition to make // sure the predicate is still true. } // The condition we are waiting for is true! // We are still holding the lock, either from before entering the monitor or from // the last execution of \\"wait\\". // Critical section of code goes here, which has a precondition that our predicate // must be true. // This code might make cv's condition false, and/or make other condition variables' // predicates true. // Call signal/notify or notifyAll, depending on which condition variables' // predicates (who share mutex m) have been made true or may have been made true, // and the monitor semantic type being used. for (cv_x in cvs_to_notify) { notify(cv_x); -- OR -- notifyAll(cv_x); } // One or more threads have been woken up but will block as soon as they try // to acquire m. // Release the mutex so that notified thread(s) and others can enter their critical // sections. release(m); Solving the bounded producer/consumer problem Having introduced the usage of condition variables, let's use it to revisit and solve the classic bounded producer/consumer problem. The classic solution is to use two monitors, comprising two condition variables sharing one lock on the queue: global volatile RingBuffer queue; // A thread-unsafe ring-buffer of tasks. global Lock queueLock; // A mutex for the ring-buffer of tasks. (Not a spin- lock.) global CV queueEmptyCV; // A condition variable for consumer threads waiting for the queue to // become non-empty. // Its associated lock is \\"queueLock\\". global CV queueFullCV; // A condition variable for producer threads waiting for the queue // to become non-full. Its associated lock is also \\"queueLock\\". // Method representing each producer thread's behavior: public method producer() { while (true) { task myTask = ...; // Producer makes some new task to be added. queueLock.acquire(); // Acquire lock for initial predicate check. while (queue.isFull()) { // Check if the queue is non-full. // Make the threading system atomically release queueLock, // enqueue this thread onto queueFullCV, and sleep this thread. wait(queueLock, queueFullCV); // Then, \\"wait\\" automatically re-acquires \\"queueLock\\" for re-checking // the predicate condition. } // Critical section that requires the queue to be non- full. // N.B.: We are holding queueLock. queue.enqueue(myTask); // Add the task to the queue. // Now the queue is guaranteed to be non-empty, so signal a consumer thread // or all consumer threads that might be blocked waiting for the queue to be non-empty: signal(queueEmptyCV); -- OR -- notifyAll(queueEmptyCV); // End of critical sections related to the queue. queueLock.release(); // Drop the queue lock until we need it again to add the next task. } } // Method representing each consumer thread's behavior: public method consumer() { while (true) { queueLock.acquire(); // Acquire lock for initial predicate check. while (queue.isEmpty()) { // Check if the queue is non-empty. // Make the threading system atomically release queueLock, // enqueue this thread onto queueEmptyCV, and sleep this thread. wait(queueLock, queueEmptyCV); // Then, \\"wait\\" automatically re-acquires \\"queueLock\\" for re- checking // the predicate condition. } // Critical section that requires the queue to be non-empty. // N.B.: We are holding queueLock. myTask = queue.dequeue(); // Take a task off of the queue. // Now the queue is guaranteed to be non-full, so signal a producer thread // or all producer threads that might be blocked waiting for the queue to be non-full: signal(queueFullCV); -- OR -- notifyAll(queueFullCV); // End of critical sections related to the queue. queueLock.release(); // Drop the queue lock until we need it again to take off the next task. doStuff(myTask); // Go off and do something with the task. } } This ensures concurrency between the producer and consumer threads sharing the task queue, and blocks the threads that have nothing to do rather than busy-waiting as shown in the aforementioned approach using spin-locks. A variant of this solution could use a single condition variable for both producers and consumers, perhaps named \\"queueFullOrEmptyCV\\" or \\"queueSizeChangedCV\\". In this case, more than one condition is associated with the condition variable, such that the condition variable represents a weaker condition than the conditions being checked by individual threads. The condition variable represents threads that are waiting for the queue to be non-full and ones waiting for it to be non-empty. However, doing this would require using notifyAll in all the threads using the condition variable and cannot use a regular signal. This is because the regular signal might wake up a thread of the wrong type whose condition has not yet been met, and that thread would go back to sleep without a thread of the correct type getting signalled. For example, a producer might make the queue full and wake up another producer instead of a consumer, and the woken producer would go back to sleep. In the complementary case, a consumer might make the queue empty and wake up another consumer instead of a producer, and the consumer would go back to sleep. Using notifyAll ensures that some thread of the right type will proceed as expected by the problem statement. Here is the variant using only one condition variable and notifyAll: global volatile RingBuffer queue; // A thread-unsafe ring-buffer of tasks. global Lock queueLock; // A mutex for the ring-buffer of tasks. (Not a spin-lock.) global CV queueFullOrEmptyCV; // A single condition variable for when the queue is not ready for any thread // -- i.e., for producer threads waiting for the queue to become non-full // and consumer threads waiting for the queue to become non-empty. // Its associated lock is \\"queueLock\\". // Not safe to use regular \\"signal\\" because it is associated with // multiple predicate conditions (assertions). // Method representing each producer thread's behavior: public method producer() { while (true) { task myTask = ...; // Producer makes some new task to be added. queueLock.acquire(); // Acquire lock for initial predicate check. while (queue.isFull()) { // Check if the queue is non-full. // Make the threading system atomically release queueLock, // enqueue this thread onto the CV, and sleep this thread. wait(queueLock, queueFullOrEmptyCV); // Then, \\"wait\\" automatically re-acquires \\"queueLock\\" for re-checking // the predicate condition. } // Critical section that requires the queue to be non-full. // N.B.: We are holding queueLock. queue.enqueue(myTask); // Add the task to the queue. // Now the queue is guaranteed to be non-empty, so signal all blocked threads // so that a consumer thread will take a task: notifyAll(queueFullOrEmptyCV); // Do not use \\"signal\\" (as it might wake up another producer instead). // End of critical sections related to the queue. queueLock.release(); // Drop the queue lock until we need it again to add the next task. } } // Method representing each consumer thread's behavior: public method consumer() { while (true) { queueLock.acquire(); // Acquire lock for initial predicate check. while (queue.isEmpty()) { // Check if the queue is non-empty. // Make the threading system atomically release queueLock, // enqueue this thread onto the CV, and sleep this thread. wait(queueLock, queueFullOrEmptyCV); // Then, \\"wait\\" automatically re-acquires \\"queueLock\\" for re-checking // the predicate condition. } // Critical section that requires the queue to be non-full. // N.B.: We are holding queueLock. myTask = queue.dequeue(); // Take a task off of the queue. // Now the queue is guaranteed to be non-full, so signal all blocked threads // so that a producer thread will take a task: notifyAll(queueFullOrEmptyCV); // Do not use \\"signal\\" (as it might wake up another consumer instead). // End of critical sections related to the queue. queueLock.release(); // Drop the queue lock until we need it again to take off the next task. doStuff(myTask); // Go off and do something with the task. } } =Synchronization primitives= Implementing mutexes and condition variables requires some kind of synchronization primitive provided by hardware support that provides atomicity. Locks and condition variables are higher-level abstractions over these synchronization primitives. On a uniprocessor, disabling and enabling interrupts is a way to implement monitors by preventing context switches during the critical sections of the locks and condition variables, but this is not enough on a multiprocessor. On a multiprocessor, usually special atomic read-modify-write instructions on the memory such as test-and-set, compare-and-swap, etc. are used, depending on what the ISA provides. These usually require deferring to spin-locking for the internal lock state itself, but this locking is very brief. Depending on the implementation, the atomic read-modify-write instructions may lock the bus from other cores' accesses and/or prevent re-ordering of instructions in the CPU. Here is an example pseudocode implementation of parts of a threading system and mutexes and Mesa-style condition variables, using test-and-set and a first-come, first-served policy. This glosses over most of how a threading system works, but shows the parts relevant to mutexes and condition variables: Sample Mesa-monitor implementation with Test-and-Set // Basic parts of threading system: // Assume \\"ThreadQueue\\" supports random access. public volatile ThreadQueue readyQueue; // Thread-unsafe queue of ready threads. Elements are (Thread*). public volatile global Thread* currentThread; // Assume this variable is per-core. (Others are shared.) // Implements a spin- lock on just the synchronized state of the threading system itself. // This is used with test-and-set as the synchronization primitive. public volatile global bool threadingSystemBusy=false; // Context-switch interrupt service routine (ISR): // On the current CPU core, preemptively switch to another thread. public method contextSwitchISR(){ if (testAndSet(threadingSystemBusy)){ return; // Can't switch context right now. } // Ensure this interrupt can't happen again which would foul up the context switch: systemCall_disableInterrupts(); // Get all of the registers of the currently-running process. // For Program Counter (PC), we will need the instruction location of // the \\"resume\\" label below. Getting the register values is platform-dependent and may involve // reading the current stack frame, JMP/CALL instructions, etc. (The details are beyond this scope.) currentThread->registers = getAllRegisters(); // Store the registers in the \\"currentThread\\" object in memory. currentThread->registers.PC = resume; // Set the next PC to the \\"resume\\" label below in this method. readyQueue.enqueue(currentThread); // Put this thread back onto the ready queue for later execution. Thread* otherThread=readyQueue.dequeue(); // Remove and get the next thread to run from the ready queue. currentThread=otherThread; // Replace the global current-thread pointer value so it is ready for the next thread. // Restore the registers from currentThread/otherThread, including a jump to the stored PC of the other thread // (at \\"resume\\" below). Again, the details of how this is done are beyond this scope. restoreRegisters(otherThread.registers); // *** Now running \\"otherThread\\" (which is now \\"currentThread\\")! The original thread is now \\"sleeping\\". *** resume: // This is where another contextSwitch() call needs to set PC to when switching context back here. // Return to where otherThread left off. threadingSystemBusy=false; // Must be an atomic assignment. systemCall_enableInterrupts(); // Turn pre-emptive switching back on on this core. } // Thread sleep method: // On current CPU core, a synchronous context switch to another thread without putting // the current thread on the ready queue. // Must be holding \\"threadingSystemBusy\\" and disabled interrupts so that this method // doesn't get interrupted by the thread-switching timer which would call contextSwitchISR(). // After returning from this method, must clear \\"threadingSystemBusy\\". public method threadSleep(){ // Get all of the registers of the currently-running process. // For Program Counter (PC), we will need the instruction location of // the \\"resume\\" label below.

There are methods to increment (V) and to decrement (P) a private integer \`s\`. However, the integer must never be decremented below 0; thus a thread that tries to decrement must wait until the integer is positive. We use a condition variable \`sIsPositive\` with an associated assertion of P_\\\\mathtt{sIsPositive} = (s > 0). monitor class Semaphore { private int s := 0 invariant s >= 0 private Condition sIsPositive _/* associated with s > 0 */_ public method P() { while s = 0: wait sIsPositive assert s > 0 s := s - 1 } public method V() { s := s + 1 assert s > 0 signal sIsPositive } } Implemented showing all synchronization (removing the assumption of a thread-safe class and showing the mutex): class Semaphore { private volatile int s := 0 invariant s >= 0 private ConditionVariable sIsPositive _/* associated with s > 0 */_ private Mutex myLock _/* Lock on \\"s\\" */_ public method P() { myLock.acquire() while s = 0: wait(myLock, sIsPositive) assert s > 0 s := s - 1 myLock.release() } public method V() { myLock.acquire() s := s + 1 assert s > 0 signal sIsPositive myLock.release() } } Monitor implemented using semaphores Conversely, locks and condition variables can also be derived from semaphores, thus making monitors and semaphores reducible to one another: The implementation given here is incorrect. If a thread calls wait() after broadcast() has been called, an originally thread may be stuck indefinitely, since broadcast() increments the semaphore only enough times for threads already waiting. public method wait(Mutex m, ConditionVariable c){ assert m.held; c.internalMutex.acquire(); c.numWaiters++; m.release(); // Can go before/after the neighboring lines. c.internalMutex.release(); // Another thread could signal here, but that's OK because of how // semaphores count. If c.sem's number becomes 1, we'll have no // waiting time. c.sem.Proberen(); // Block on the CV. // Woken m.acquire(); // Re-acquire the mutex. } public method signal(ConditionVariable c){ c.internalMutex.acquire(); if (c.numWaiters > 0){ c.numWaiters--; c.sem.Verhogen(); // (Doesn't need to be protected by c.internalMutex.) } c.internalMutex.release(); } public method broadcast(ConditionVariable c){ c.internalMutex.acquire(); while (c.numWaiters > 0){ c.numWaiters--; c.sem.Verhogen(); // (Doesn't need to be protected by c.internalMutex.) } c.internalMutex.release(); } class Mutex { protected boolean held=false; // For assertions only, to make sure sem's number never goes > 1. protected Semaphore sem=Semaphore(1); // The number shall always be at most 1. // Not held < 1; held < 0. public method acquire(){ sem.Proberen(); assert !held; held=true; } public method release(){ assert held; // Make sure we never Verhogen sem above 1. That would be bad. held=false; sem.Verhogen(); } } class ConditionVariable { protected int numWaiters=0; // Roughly tracks the number of waiters blocked in sem. // (The semaphore's internal state is necessarily private.) protected Semaphore sem=Semaphore(0); // Provides the wait queue. protected Mutex internalMutex; // (Really another Semaphore. Protects \\"numWaiters\\".) } When a signal happens on a condition variable that at least one other thread is waiting on, there are at least two threads that could then occupy the monitor: the thread that signals and any one of the threads that is waiting. In order that at most one thread occupies the monitor at each time, a choice must be made. Two schools of thought exist on how best to resolve this choice. This leads to two kinds of condition variables which will be examined next: * Blocking condition variables give priority to a signaled thread. * Nonblocking condition variables give priority to the signaling thread. =Blocking condition variables= The original proposals by C. A. R. Hoare and Per Brinch Hansen were for blocking condition variables. With a blocking condition variable, the signaling thread must wait outside the monitor (at least) until the signaled thread relinquishes occupancy of the monitor by either returning or by again waiting on a condition variable. Monitors using blocking condition variables are often called Hoare-style monitors or signal-and-urgent-wait monitors. A Hoare style monitor with two condition variables \`a\` and \`b\`. After Buhr et al. We assume there are two queues of threads associated with each monitor object * \`e\` is the entrance queue * \`s\` is a queue of threads that have signaled. In addition we assume that for each condition variable , there is a queue * \`.q\`, which is a queue for threads waiting on condition variable All queues are typically guaranteed to be fair and, in some implementations, may be guaranteed to be first in first out. The implementation of each operation is as follows. (We assume that each operation runs in mutual exclusion to the others; thus restarted threads do not begin executing until the operation is complete.) enter the monitor: enter the method if the monitor is locked add this thread to e block this thread else lock the monitor leave the monitor: schedule return from the method wait : add this thread to .q schedule block this thread signal : if there is a thread waiting on .q select and remove one such thread t from .q (t is called \\"the signaled thread\\") add this thread to s restart t (so t will occupy the monitor next) block this thread schedule : if there is a thread on s select and remove one thread from s and restart it (this thread will occupy the monitor next) else if there is a thread on e select and remove one thread from e and restart it (this thread will occupy the monitor next) else unlock the monitor (the monitor will become unoccupied) The \`schedule\` routine selects the next thread to occupy the monitor or, in the absence of any candidate threads, unlocks the monitor. The resulting signaling discipline is known a \\"signal and urgent wait,\\" as the signaler must wait, but is given priority over threads on the entrance queue. An alternative is \\"signal and wait,\\" in which there is no \`s\` queue and signaler waits on the \`e\` queue instead. Some implementations provide a signal and return operation that combines signaling with returning from a procedure. signal and return : if there is a thread waiting on .q select and remove one such thread t from .q (t is called \\"the signaled thread\\") restart t (so t will occupy the monitor next) else schedule return from the method In either case (\\"signal and urgent wait\\" or \\"signal and wait\\"), when a condition variable is signaled and there is at least one thread on waiting on the condition variable, the signaling thread hands occupancy over to the signaled thread seamlessly, so that no other thread can gain occupancy in between. If is true at the start of each signal operation, it will be true at the end of each wait operation. This is summarized by the following contracts. In these contracts, is the monitor's invariant. enter the monitor: postcondition leave the monitor: precondition wait : precondition modifies the state of the monitor postcondition and signal : precondition and modifies the state of the monitor postcondition signal and return : precondition and In these contracts, it is assumed that and do not depend on the contents or lengths of any queues. (When the condition variable can be queried as to the number of threads waiting on its queue, more sophisticated contracts can be given. For example, a useful pair of contracts, allowing occupancy to be passed without establishing the invariant, is wait : precondition modifies the state of the monitor postcondition signal precondition (not empty() and ) or (empty() and ) modifies the state of the monitor postcondition See Howard and Buhr et al., for more). It is important to note here that the assertion is entirely up to the programmer; he or she simply needs to be consistent about what it is. We conclude this section with an example of a thread-safe class using a blocking monitor that implements a bounded, thread-safe stack. monitor class SharedStack { private const capacity := 10 private int[capacity] A private int size := 0 invariant 0 <= size and size <= capacity private BlockingCondition theStackIsNotEmpty _/* associated with 0 < size and size <= capacity */_ private BlockingCondition theStackIsNotFull _/* associated with 0 <= size and size < capacity */_ public method push(int value) { if size = capacity then wait theStackIsNotFull assert 0 <= size and size < capacity A[size] := value ; size := size + 1 assert 0 < size and size <= capacity signal theStackIsNotEmpty and return } public method int pop() { if size = 0 then wait theStackIsNotEmpty assert 0 < size and size <= capacity size := size - 1 ; assert 0 <= size and size < capacity signal theStackIsNotFull and return A[size] } } Note that, in this example, the thread-safe stack is internally providing a mutex, which, as in the earlier producer/consumer example, is shared by both condition variables, which are checking different conditions on the same concurrent data. The only difference is that the producer/consumer example assumed a regular non-thread-safe queue and was using a standalone mutex and condition variables, without these details of the monitor abstracted away as is the case here. In this example, when the \\"wait\\" operation is called, it must somehow be supplied with the thread-safe stack's mutex, such as if the \\"wait\\" operation is an integrated part of the \\"monitor class\\". Aside from this kind of abstracted functionality, when a \\"raw\\" monitor is used, it will always have to include a mutex and a condition variable, with a unique mutex for each condition variable. =Nonblocking condition variables= With nonblocking condition variables (also called \\"Mesa style\\" condition variables or \\"signal and continue\\" condition variables), signaling does not cause the signaling thread to lose occupancy of the monitor. Instead the signaled threads are moved to the \`e\` queue. There is no need for the \`s\` queue. A Mesa style monitor with two condition variables \`a\` and \`b\` With nonblocking condition variables, the signal operation is often called notify -- a terminology we will follow here. It is also common to provide a notify all operation that moves all threads waiting on a condition variable to the \`e\` queue. The meaning of various operations are given here. (We assume that each operation runs in mutual exclusion to the others; thus restarted threads do not begin executing until the operation is complete.) enter the monitor: enter the method if the monitor is locked add this thread to e block this thread else lock the monitor leave the monitor: schedule return from the method wait : add this thread to .q schedule block this thread notify : if there is a thread waiting on .q select and remove one thread t from .q (t is called \\"the notified thread\\") move t to e notify all : move all threads waiting on .q to e schedule : if there is a thread on e select and remove one thread from e and restart it else unlock the monitor As a variation on this scheme, the notified thread may be moved to a queue called \`w\`, which has priority over \`e\`. See Howard and Buhr et al. for further discussion. It is possible to associate an assertion with each condition variable such that is sure to be true upon return from \`wait \`. However, one must ensure that is preserved from the time the notifying thread gives up occupancy until the notified thread is selected to re-enter the monitor. Between these times there could be activity by other occupants. Thus it is common for to simply be true. For this reason, it is usually necessary to enclose each wait operation in a loop like this while not( ) do wait c where is some condition stronger than . The operations \`notify \` and \`notify all \` are treated as \\"hints\\" that may be true for some waiting thread. Every iteration of such a loop past the first represents a lost notification; thus with nonblocking monitors, one must be careful to ensure that too many notifications can not be lost. As an example of \\"hinting\\" consider a bank account in which a withdrawing thread will wait until the account has sufficient funds before proceeding monitor class Account { private int balance := 0 invariant balance >= 0 private NonblockingCondition balanceMayBeBigEnough public method withdraw(int amount) precondition amount >= 0 { while balance < amount do wait balanceMayBeBigEnough assert balance >= amount balance := balance - amount } public method deposit(int amount) precondition amount >= 0 { balance := balance + amount notify all balanceMayBeBigEnough } } In this example, the condition being waited for is a function of the amount to be withdrawn, so it is impossible for a depositing thread to know that it made such a condition true. It makes sense in this case to allow each waiting thread into the monitor (one at a time) to check if its assertion is true. =Implicit condition variable monitors= A Java style monitor In the Java language, each object may be used as a monitor. Methods requiring mutual exclusion must be explicitly marked with the synchronized keyword. Blocks of code may also be marked by synchronized. Rather than having explicit condition variables, each monitor (i.e. object) is equipped with a single wait queue in addition to its entrance queue. All waiting is done on this single wait queue and all notify and notifyAll operations apply to this queue. This approach has been adopted in other languages, for example C#. =Implicit signaling= Another approach to signaling is to omit the signal operation. Whenever a thread leaves the monitor (by returning or waiting) the assertions of all waiting threads are evaluated until one is found to be true. In such a system, condition variables are not needed, but the assertions must be explicitly coded. The contract for wait is wait : precondition modifies the state of the monitor postcondition and History Brinch Hansen and Hoare developed the monitor concept in the early 1970s, based on earlier ideas of their own and of Edsger Dijkstra. Brinch Hansen published the first monitor notation, adopting the class concept of Simula 67, and invented a queueing mechanism. Hoare refined the rules of process resumption. Brinch Hansen created the first implementation of monitors, in Concurrent Pascal. Hoare demonstrated their equivalence to semaphores. Monitors (and Concurrent Pascal) were soon used to structure process synchronization in the Solo operating system. Programming languages that have supported monitors include *Ada since Ada 95 (as protected objects) *C# (and other languages that use the .NET Framework) *Concurrent Euclid *Concurrent Pascal *D *Delphi (Delphi 2009 and above, via TObject.Monitor) *Java (via the wait and notify methods) *Mesa *Modula-3 *Python (via threading.Condition object) *Ruby *Squeak Smalltalk *Turing, Turing+, and Object-Oriented Turing *¬µC++ *Visual Prolog A number of libraries have been written that allow monitors to be constructed in languages that do not support them natively. When library calls are used, it is up to the programmer to explicitly mark the start and end of code executed with mutual exclusion. Pthreads is one such library.

He purportedly possessed supernatural powers, which he used to help the poor and stand up to injustice. However, he was also known for his wild and eccentric behavior, who didn't follow Buddhist monastic rules by consuming alcohol and meat. By the time of his death, Ji Gong had become a legend in Chinese culture and a deity in Chinese folk religion. He is mentioned by Buddhists in folktales and k≈çans, and sometimes invoked by oracles to assist in worldly affairs. History Li Xiuyuan was born to a former military advisor, Li Maochun. After the death of his parents, at the age of 18, Li was sent to Hangzhou and was ordained as a monk in Lingyin Temple. He was mentored by the vinaya master Huiyuan and was given the monastic name Daoji. Unlike traditional Buddhist monks, Daoji did not like following traditional monastic codes. He had a penchant for openly eating meat and drinking wine; his robes were often tattered and dirty from traveling from place to place, and stumbling while intoxicated. However, Daoji was kindhearted and was always ready to lend a helping hand to ordinary people. He would often treat the sick and fight against injustice. The monks, bewildered and fed up with his behavior, expelled Daoji from the monastery. From then on, Daoji roamed the streets and helped people whenever he could. According to legend, while cultivating the Buddha's teaching, Daoji attained supernatural powers. Many who noticed his eccentric yet benevolent and compassionate nature began to think that he was an incarnate of a bodhisattva, or a reincarnate of an arhat. He was widely recognised by people as the incarnate of the Taming Dragon Arhat (), one of the Eighteen Arhats. When Daoji last stay was at Jingci Temple and moved to heaven on the 14th day of the 5th Lunar month (16 May 1209), syncretic Taoism began to revere Daoji as a deity. Not long after that, Buddhism began to recognise Daoji's compassionate efforts and he is involved in many classic k≈çans. Mediums claimed to receive texts from Ji Gong through spirit writing, later called Fuji (planchette writing) (Êâ∂‰π©/Êâ∂ÁÆï), since the mid-1860s. These messages led to a development of the worshipers of Ji Gong, which was actively promoted by the Buddhist monk Falun (Ê≥ïËº™) at the Hupao Temple ((ËôéË∑ëÂØ∫) in Hangzhou, where Ji Gong‚Äôs grave is located. The messages gradually acquired a moralistic tone and recommended to engage in charitable work. Ji Gong‚Äôs messages received through spirit writing played a role in the establishment of the Benevolent Relief Society (ÊïëÊøüÂñÑÊúÉ), whose leaders later participated in the foundation of the Red Cross Society of China.Wang Chien- ch‚Äôuan, ‚ÄúSpirit Writing Groups in Modern China (1840‚Äì1937): Textual Production, Public Teachings, and Charity.‚Äù In Modern Chinese Religion II 1850‚Äì2015, edited by Vincent Goossaert, Jan Kiely and John Lagerwey, Leiden: Brill, vol. 2, 651‚Äì684 (668‚Äì673). A new Buddhist movement, the Hong Kong-based Tung Cheng Yuen Buddhist Association (), worship him. Yiguandao has also adopted him into their pantheon of deities, citing Zhang Tianran, contemporary founder of the Yiguandao, as his reincarnation. Depiction Ji Gong can usually be seen smiling in tattered monastic robes, and usually carries a bottle of wine in his right hand, and a fan in his left hand. He wears a hat with the Chinese character Fo (), meaning \\"Buddha\\". He can also be seen holding his shoes in his right hand. Because of his carefree nature, he is rarely ever shown with a serious facial expression.

It was designed by Charles Brigham in the Richardsonian Romanesque style. History =Millicent Gifford Rogers= While her family resided in New York City, where her father was a key man in the Standard Oil Trust, young Millicent Rogers and her sisters and brother had been happy vacation and weekend habitu√©s of the little town of Fairhaven from birth. With their parents, both of whom were themselves Fairhaven natives‚Äîthey had spent happy, care-free hours there among relatives and friends, in particular communion with both maternal and paternal grandparents.

When she died at such a young age, her grieving family sought an appropriate means of memorializing her short life. Because she had been an avid reader, especially of poetry, the Rogers decided that they would build and donate to the town of Fairhaven a library named for her and given in the names of her sisters and brother. The Millicent Library in 1899. =Library= In the same year she had died, land was acquired and plan were begun to erect in Fairhaven a unique and lavish tribute to the arts, the splendid yet functional Millicent Library. The cornerstone was laid in September, 1891 at quiet morning ceremony with only the family and their clergyman, Rev. J.M. Leighton, in attendance. After prayer, Millie's little brother, Harry, set the cornerstone. Within its confines were a sketch of Millicent, a tracing of the Rogers' ancestry, and a copy of the Fairhaven Star carrying a picture of the proposed building. The Millicent Library describes the memorial window to the little girl who wished for a good library in Fairhaven as follows: :\\"In the Library, just to the left of the main entrance, is a stunning stained-glass window made by Clayton and Bell of London. In the central panel is the figure of Erato, the Muse of Poetry, and her features bear a striking resemblance to those of the girl to whose memory the library was erected.\\" Mark Twain extolled the library as \\"ideal\\".

The Victory Palace was designed in 1937 to house the Foreign Ministry, and nearly complete in 1944. It was designed by architect Duiliu Marcu (1885‚Äì1966), who had designed many major buildings in 1920s and 30s Romania, including many major government projects in the 1930s and 40s. The Victory Palace is a stylised monumental classical design, with an arcaded ground level, a long colonnade of slim piers on the main front, and two recessed top floors. The facades were entirely clad in Carrara marble, with reliefs in the panels at either end, and there were generously decorated interiors. The building suffered heavy damage in the 1944 Bombing of Bucharest in World War II. It then underwent significant restoration and reconstruction works, being reclad in travertine, without the reliefs and less ornate interiors, finally opening in 1952, housing the headquarters of Foreign Ministry and the Council of Ministers. Following the Romanian Revolution, in 1990 it became the headquarters of the first government of post-communist Romania, a role it still fulfils, housing the office of the Prime Minister of Romania.

The FTC took no action against Acxiom, which had responded that it had followed its privacy principles and was not deceptive in its business practices. \\"Torch Concepts was acting under contract to the Department of Defense in their efforts to research ways to improve military base security\\", a company spokesman said. \\"Our policy clearly states that we 'provide information products which include financial information, Social Security number and other related information where permitted by law,' and that this information is 'provided to government agencies for the purposes of verifying information, employment screening and assisting law enforcement.'\\" =Security breach (2003)= In 2003, more than 1.6 billion customer records were stolen during the transmission of information to and from LiveRamp predecessor Acxiom's clients; the information included names, addresses, and e-mail addresses. Prosecutors described the 2006 case against the hacker accused of stealing the data as the \\"largest ever invasion and theft of personal data\\" ever tried. The stolen data came to light during an investigation of a separate data theft incident. Based on their investigation, prosecutors said there was no risk of identity theft or harm to individuals based on the breaches. They also praised Acxiom for being aggressive in pursuing the hackers and cooperating with authorities. \\"The positive outcome of this investigation is testament to the strong partnerships we have established with our counterparts at the headquarters and field offices of various organizations, from the FBI and Department of Justice to the Internal Revenue Service and U.S. Attorneys' Office in Little Rock\\", said K.

It became one of the most influential voices in the British North American colonies in its nearly one century of existence. The paper was founded as the Nova Scotian or Colonial Herald by George R. Young, in 1824. Joseph Howe took control of it in 1827, establishing the paper's motto: \\"The free constitution which guards the British press.\\" Published as a weekly, the paper played a key role in the intellectual and political life of Nova Scotia. A letter published in the Novascotian in 1835 led to charges of libel against Howe. When acquitted, he proclaimed: \\"the Press of Nova Scotia is free.\\" With a circulation of 3000 subscribers, the Novascotian became the leading provincial newspaper in the 1840s. A well-known contributor was Thomas Chandler Haliburton, creator of the immensely popular character Sam Slick. Howe's entry into politics necessitated selling the paper. Nevertheless, the Novascotian remained a liberal voice in the province until the First World War, reaching a peak circulation of 20,000. Later it was published as the Nova Scotian and then Nova Scotia's Farm and Home Journal. It was discontinued in the 1920s after years of dwindling circulation following a change of its political allegiances to the Union Government. The name Novascotian is still in use. It is now printed as a human interest section of The Chronicle-Herald newspaper of Halifax. The early years, 1824-1931 The paper was founded as the Novascotian or Colonial Herald by George R. Young in 1824.Chisolm, 3. Young had a very respectable circulation due to the ability of him and his writers as well as the great newspaper industry emerging at the time. Towards the end of 1827, Young was showing waning interest in the running of his newspaper, because he wanted to become a lawyer, so on January 3, 1828, he sold the Novascotian to Joseph Howe for 1050 pounds, making Howe the sole editor and owner. The initial reaction to Howe running the Novascotian was poor. Many of its readers withdrew their subscriptions, believing that Howe was too young, unskilled and inexperienced to run a newspaper. Howe indeed was only 23 years old when he purchased the Novascotian and had had no regular education as it had not been possible for him to walk to school in the winter.Chisolm, 2. However, Howe had been working in the office of the Royal Gazette since he was 13 years old, and during the months he could not go to school he had books to study, and his father, who for many years worked in the offices of the King's Printer and Postmaster-General of the Lower Provinces, to talk to. Howe overcame the difficulties he faced with the Novascotian, due to his willingness to travel, network and expand his own knowledge: * Howe read British, foreign, and colonial newspapers daily. * Howe reported on the debates in the House of Assembly and important trials in the courts with his own hand. * Howe was in a position to mingle with nearly all the public men of the day. * Howe travelled all over inland districts and to seaport towns, taking in the surroundings and making many acquaintances.Chisolm, 4. * Howe read political literature of all countries which expressed their opinions in English. It was with this gained knowledge that Howe moved to shape his newspaper. Howe had a vision for the Novascotian; it was his mission to, \\"furnish the readers all that properly came under the heading of news, whether British, Colonial, American, or European.\\"Beck (1964), 3. Howe wanted to get all of the news to the people. He did not want the Novascotian to have an affiliation with any one political party or government because it was for the people. Howe's critics would have appeared to have been correct during the first year of Howe's Novascotian, because he had started it with almost no politics or editorial commentary. There were, however, some interesting submissions which had shown some promise. On July 24, 1828 Howe introduced \\"Western Rambles\\", a series which gave the Novascotian's readers an insight into the Western part of their own country. The series ran until October 9, 1828.Beck (1964), 206. From December 1829 until August, 1831, Howe \\"Eastern Rambles\\", a series that presented a perspective from the Eastern part of British North America. Political influence, 1832-1835 The Novascotian started to become more politically involved in the following couple of years, gaining significant influence as it went. The title page of the Novascotian always read the same motto, \\"The Constitution, the whole Constitution, and nothing but the Constitution.\\"Beck (1964), 22. This showed that Howe wanted his newspaper to be nonpartisan in all matters, which was unique compared to the other newspapers printed at the time. The Novascotian would support the Government in their actions if they were right for doing so, and would warn the People when the actions of the Government were not proper.Beck (1964), 23. During the late 1820s and early 1830s, as newspapers grew so did their confidence in terms of the reporting of political events, embracing the concept of public argument and conversation over political issues.Campbell, 87. It was during this time that the Novascotian evolved into the outspoken and combative newspaper that it was.Campbell, 88. On July 8, 1829, Howe introduced a section in the Novascotian entitled \\"Legislative Reviews\\". The Novascotian was the first newspaper in Nova Scotia and one of the first newspapers in all of British North America to give regular reports on what went on within the House of Assembly. This was monumental for the citizens of Nova Scotia and for British North America as a whole. It was Howe's opinion without the Novascotian's reports on the legislative assembly, British North America would have limited knowledge of what went on in the meetings in which decisions were made that directly affected all British North Americans.Beck (1964), 24. The Novascotian was the cutting edge of the time when it came to the development of political conversation.Campbell, 88-89. This was because Howe was the first to give regular reports on the House of Assembly and opened up his newspaper to the voices of the public through letters. Also, the Novascotian, despite all of the political discussion and criticism that would be published, it was not the most radical newspaper in Nova Scotia at the time: The Colonial Patriot was even more critical and daring in their discussion of political issues. This was beneficial to Howe and the Novascotian because it meant that he was less likely to be targeted by the government for charges of libel. However, the Colonial Patriot folded in 1834, leaving the Novascotian as the most radical newspaper in Nova Scotia. This increase in political involvement climaxed on January 1, 1835, when Howe published a letter, signed 'The People', in the Novascotian that denounced the current local magistrates of Halifax. Joseph Howe's criminal libel trial of 1835 During the year 1834, Howe was starting to attract attention to himself due to his strong independent viewpoints in his editorials in the Novascotian, the Government was starting to take notice.Chisholm, 7. Howe had eventually reached his breaking point and in late 1834, wrote in the Novascotian that he was going to start a campaign in the interest of bringing to light the wrongful actions of government.Rosner, 11. On January 1, 1835, the final piece of this campaign was published in the Novascotian, a letter signed \\"The People\\".Beck (1974), 31. This letter accused the magistrates of \\"reprehensible irresponsibility, incompetence, and self-interestedness in the conduct of their responsibilities.\\"Campbell, 80. Because the letter was published, Howe was put on trial for seditious libel, being charged with \\"seditiously contriving, devising, and intending to stir up and incite discontent and sedition among His Majesty's subjects.\\"Rosner, 12. The crime of seditious libel had been defined 200 years prior to the time of Howe's trial and was seen by many as an unfair crime as it could be as broad or as specific as the court chose.Seditious Libel If Howe had been convicted of seditious libel, the Novascotian would have been shut down.Saul, 10. Howe represented himself in the trial and presented nothing but a 6 h 15 min speech against the charge. The jury took 10 min to decide to acquit Howe on the charge of criminal libel. The victory of Howe in the court was considered monumental at the time. In the first issue of the Novascotian following the acquittal, Howe claimed that \\"the press of Nova-Scotia is Free.\\"Beck (1974), 39. It is said that Howe's libel victory established the fundamental basis for the freedom of the press in Canada, but other scholars have offered contrary opinions. 1840 to present With a circulation of 3000 subscribers, the Novascotian became the leading provincial newspaper in the 1840s. A well-known contributor was Thomas Chandler Haliburton, creator of the immensely popular character, Sam Slick. Howe's entry into politics necessitated selling the paper. Nevertheless, the Novascotian remained a liberal voice in the province until the First World War, reaching a peak circulation of 20,000.

The cartridge required the user to have the Famicom cartridge label to face the back as otherwise it would cause damage to the cart and/or system. There is a fabric tab on the convert to allow the easy removal of the convert from the original front-loading NES and the subsequent top loader (although the cartridge was easy to access, the converter would sit in the cartridge slot of the second model in a near flush like state, thus leaving the adaptor difficult to remove). History The original Nintendo console released in Japan (the Famicom) used a 60-pin cartridge for games. When Nintendo decided to market it outside Japan, they redesigned a number of things, including changing the cartridge system to a 72 pin setup. This is problematic for anyone wishing to play Japanese games on a NES, and thus a number of companies (including Nintendo themselves) produced an adapter to allow 60-pin games to be played in 72-pin systems. Trivia Due to a production overrun of the two R.O.B. games (Gyromite and Stack-Up) in Japan, Nintendo ended up selling these two games in the U.S. with an internal adapter. The game itself looks normal, but inside are the electronics from the Japanese version plugged into a 60 to 72 adapter. This has contributed to a shortage of the two games, with people looking for a cheap adaptor disassembling these games. Only the early editions have the adapters. The same adapter is also in early editions of the following games: 1942, Clu Clu Land, Donkey Kong Jr., Duck Hunt, Elevator Action, Excitebike, Golf, Gumshoe, Gyromite, Hogan's Alley, Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!, Pinball, Raid on Bungeling Bay, Rygar, Soccer, Stack Up (all have converters), Tennis, Urban Champion, Wizards and Warriors, Wrecking Crew, although this is less publicly known.

Much of her life was taken up in defence of the rights of her husband and, later, son to the dukedom, which was challenged by the House of Blois during the War of the Breton Succession. Known for her fiery personality, Joanna led the Montfortist cause after her husband had been captured, and began the fight-back, showing considerable skill as a military leader. Shortly after taking refuge in England, she was confined to Tickhill Castle by order of King Edward III. Joanna was highly praised by the chronicler Jean Froissart for her courage and energy. Because of her feats of leadership, David Hume described her as \\"the most extraordinary woman of the age\\". Life Joanna was the daughter of Louis I, Count of Nevers and Joan, Countess of Rethel, and the sister of Louis I, Count of Flanders. She married John of Monfort in March 1329. John of Monfort claimed the title of Duke of Brittany, although his claim was contested by Joan of Penthi√®vre and her husband, Charles of Blois. Joanna and John had two children:Jones, Michael, The Creation of Brittany, (The Hambledon Press, 1988), 210. * John IV, Duke of Brittany (1339‚Äì1399) * Joan of Brittany, Baroness of Drayton (1341 ‚Äì aft. 20 October 1399), born at the onset of the War of the Breton Succession, married before 21 October 1385 to Ralph Basset, 4th Baron Basset de Drayton =War of the Breton Succession= When John III, Duke of Brittany died childless in 1341, he left behind a contentious succession dispute. For many years he tried to find means to ensure that the children of his stepmother, Yolande of Dreux would not inherit the Duchy, including trying to have her marriage to his father annulled. At this time he declared his heir to be his niece Joan of Penthi√®vre. However he reconciled with his half brother, John of Monfort, shortly before his death, and indicated that he was to be the successor. Thus upon the death of Duke John III, there were two rival claimants for Brittany: the House of Montfort, led by John of Montfort and his wife Joanna, and the House of Blois led by Charles of Blois and his wife Joan of Penthi√®vre. John of Montfort went to Paris to be heard by King Philip VI of France. Philip was an uncle of Charles, and he imprisoned John, despite having given him a promise of safe conduct. Philip and the French courts then declared Joan and Charles to be the true heirs to the Duchy. Joanna then announced her infant son as the leader of the Montfortist faction. She mustered an army and captured Redon. From there she went to Hennebont, to prepare it for a siege. Charles of Blois duly arrived in 1342 and besieged the town. She then sent Amaury de Clisson to ask King Edward III of England for aid. This, Edward was eager to give, since he had been claiming the French crown for himself, and was therefore at odds with Philip. If he could get Brittany as an ally, this would be of great advantage for future campaigns. He prepared ships under the command of Sir Walter Manny to relieve the siege.Butler, Pierce, Women of Medieval France, Chapter IX, Barrie, London 1907. Siege of Hennebont In the siege of Hennebont, she took up arms and, dressed in armour, conducted the defence of the town, encouraging the people to fight, and urging the women to \\"cut their skirts and take their safety in their own hands\\". When she looked from a tower and saw that the enemy camp was almost unguarded, she led three hundred men on a charge, burned down Charles' supplies and destroyed his tents. After this she became known as \\"Jeanne la Flamme\\". When the Blois faction realised what was happening, they cut off her retreat to the town, but she and her knights rode to Brest, drawing a portion of the Blois force with them. Having secured Brest, she gathered together extra supporters and secretly returned to Hennebont, evading the Blois forces and re-entering the town with her reinforcements. Charles of Blois tried to starve the people in Hennebont. During a long meeting the bishop of Leon tried to persuade Joanna to surrender, but from the window she saw Walter Manny's fleet from England sailing up. Hennebont was strengthened with the English forces and held out. Charles was forced to retreat, but tried to isolate Joanna by taking other towns in Brittany. On his return he again failed to capture Hennebont. Fight back Joanna sailed to England to seek further reinforcements from King Edward, which he provided, but the English fleet was intercepted on its way to Brittany by Charles of Blois' ally, Louis of Spain. In a hard- fought battle, the sailors and knights grappled in hand-to-hand combat as Louis' men attempted to board Joanna's ship. According to Froissart, Joanna fought in person \\"with the heart of a lion, and in her hand she wielded a sharp glaive, wherewith she fought fiercely\\". Eventually the English forces beat off Louis's ships and made harbour near Vannes. Her forces then captured Vannes, besieged Rennes and sought to break the siege of Hennebont. From this point Joanna played little direct part in the fighting, as her faction was now being led by English warlords. With neither side able to achieve a decisive victory, by the truce of Malestroit in 1343, her husband John was released and hostilities ceased for a period. He was later imprisoned once again, but escaped and resumed the conflict. When her husband died in 1345 in the midst of the war, she again became the leader of the Montfort party to protect the rights of her son John V against the House of Blois. In 1347, English forces acting on her behalf captured Charles of Blois in battle. =Confinement= By this time Joanna and her son were living in England. In England, after being initially welcomed with honor, she was later confined by order of King Edward III and spent the rest of her life in confinement at Tickhill Castle and elsewhere. King Edward III entrusted her to the care of Sir William Frank until 1346, Thomas Haukeston (1346‚Äì57), John Delves (d. 1370) and finally to his widow Isabella and Godfrei Foljambe. Arthur de la Borderie attributed her confinement to mental illness, but more recent research finds no evidence she was insane. It is unlikely that \\"Warmer\\" (Warnier?) de Giston, assisted by his yeoman, would have risked gravely compromising himself by taking her out of the castle in 1347 and attempting to flee with her if she were mentally ill. Edward III probably imprisoned her in order to increase his own power in Brittany. She lived long enough to see the final victory of her son John IV, Duke of Brittany over the House of Blois in 1364, but she never returned to the duchy. The last mention made of the duchess and her guardian is 14 February 1374. It seems she died that year. Legacy Joanna of Flanders spots the English fleet arriving to relieve Hennebont, 1342 Illus. from Fran√ßois Guizot's, History of France, 1869 Joanna was later known as a prototype of the martial woman in Brittany, and a possible influence on Joan of Arc.Stephen Wesley Richey, Joan of Arc: The Warrior Saint, Greenwood, 2003, p.116. Jean Froissart said she \\"had the courage of a man and the heart of a lion\\". David Hume described her as \\"the most extraordinary woman of the age\\". Victorian feminists also cited her as a role-model. Harriet Taylor Mill mentions her as one of the \\"heroic chatelaines\\" of the Middle Ages in her essay \\"The Enfranchisement of Women\\".John Stuart Mill, Alice S. Rossi, Harriet Taylor Mill, Essays on Sex Equality, University of Chicago Press, 1970, p.102. Amelia Bloomer also cites her as one of the \\"heroic women\\" of the era.Anne C. Coon (ed) Hear Me Patiently:The Reform Speeches of Amelia Jenks Bloomer, Greenwood Press, Westport, CT, 1994, p.158/ Pierce Butler said that she is \\"known to us, through the enthusiastic record of Froissart, as an amazon, but hardly known at all as a woman\\".

The melodies from this waltz were drawn from Strauss' operetta Der Zigeunerbaron which premiered to critical acclaim on 24 October 1885. The practice of composing new and independent orchestral works drawn from Strauss' music for the operettas has been prominent since the days of Jacques Offenbach, another operetta composer who frequently whetted his audiences' appetite by writing and subsequently performing his overtures before the premiere of a new stage work, so that the music can be appraised by a wider public and meant that more individual piano edition transcriptions could be sold by music publishers to the public who would easily tend to recall independent pieces. Strauss' Der Zigeunerbaron, a Hungarian-influenced work, remained his next best-remembered operetta after Die Fledermaus and brims with memorable melodies taken from the stage work. The work's title was taken from Act 2 trio Ha, seht es winkt, es blinkt, es klingt when the character Sandor Barinkay locates an ancestral treasure in his estate and shares his jubilation with the other cast, Saffi and Czipra. However, the beauty of the waltz lies in the first waltz theme also found in the Act 2 Finale aria of the operetta titled So voll Fr√∂hlichkeit. \\\\relative c' { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff { \\\\key a \\\\minor \\\\time 6/8 \\\\tempo \\\\markup { \\\\column { \\\\line { M√§ssig langsam. } } } r1 r8 r4 8-^ g'8. f16 e8 e8. d16 c8 c4( d8 e4) 8-^ g'8. f16 e8 e8. d16 c8 d4( e8 f4) } ew Staff { \\\\key a \\\\minor \\\\time 6/8 \\\\clef bass << { s8 s s s s s s s s s s s s s s c8.[ g16 e8] e4( g8 c4) s8 s s s c8.[ g16 e8] f4( a8 d4) } \\\\\\\\\\\\ { g,8\\\\p[ r g] g[ r g] g[ r g] g r r 8[ \\\\arpeggio r ] c4. c4.~ c4 r8 8[ \\\\arpeggio r ] c4. c4. r4 } >> } >> } The work begins in C major, in a march-like tune (Du kannst der Zigeuner ganz vertrau'n) before the So voll Fr√∂hlichkeit first waltz section melodies enter.

A peaceful 4th waltz section in C is next (Doch, mehr als Gold und Geld) before the climax with cymbals in G (Das war' kein rechter Schiffersknecht), and punctuated throughout with trombones and French horns. The coda recalls earlier material briefly before the first waltz section dances in and rushes headlong into a dazzling finish, underlined by a timpani drumroll and brass flourish.

It is set in a fictional universe version of Earth where time moves backwards. The novel was written solely by Rob Grant and remains his only solo-writing endeavour for Red Dwarf, Grant having previously stepped down from co-writing with Naylor for the television show after its Series VI final, Out of Time. It contains plot elements from the episodes Backwards, Dimension Jump, and Gunmen of the Apocalypse. An audiobook of Backwards was also produced, read by the author. Plot summary =On the Backwards World= The Red Dwarf crew arrive on htraE (a version of Earth in a universe where time is running backwards) in order to rescue Lister, who has returned to life and the age of 25 (following his death at age 61 the end of the previous novel, Better Than Life) as a result of the crew depositing his body on the time-reversed Earth 36 years earlier. After failing to meet Lister at the arranged rendezvous, Kryten learns from the television that Lister and Cat are associated with a murder that, due to the backwards flow of time, has not yet been committed. Lister soon arrives injured and in the custody of the police who, after a backwards fight which restores Lister to health, promptly unarrest him. Lister then takes off in backwards pursuit of one of the officers, explaining to the others that due to the nature of reverse time he is forced to follow the policeman (who if time were running forwards would be chasing him) until he is 'unspotted'. After a harrowing backwards car-chase (especially for Rimmer, who is unable to trust that no harm can befall him while time is running backwards) the policeman unsees them, and the crew retreat to the mountain area where they landed their ship, the Starbug. When they arrive, the crew examine Starbug to find most of the landing jets missing and the underside a mess of rust and badly-repaired damage. Unable to understand how it happened, but realising that on the backwards Earth they will need the landing jets to perform a take-off, they begin searching for the missing jets. While searching Kryten discovers the body of a hillbilly, who has been killed with a pickaxe. He panics when the corpse begins returning to life and removes the pickaxe from the man's chest. Once the man leaves, Kryten replays the incident 'forwards' and realises he was responsible for killing the man, a serious breach of his programming not to harm humans. Overwhelmed by guilt, Kryten shuts himself down. Upon learning what's happened, Lister realises that this was the murder for which he was imprisoned and is overwhelmed at finally learning that he was not only innocent but Kryten was the one responsible for his lengthy prison sentence. Despite this, Lister forgives him and tries to get him working again. Having only found one landing jet and that in terrible condition, and with Lister busy repairing Kryten, the crew's attempt at a reverse landing fails and they are trapped on htraE, having missed their window. Kryten is eventually fixed and he informs them they will have to wait 10 years for another opportunity to leave. Ten years pass and while Kryten and Rimmer are physically unaffected, the reverse time of backwards Earth means Lister and The Cat are now 15. During the wait, The Cat becomes a virgin during a bizarre sexual encounter with a female cousin of the 'un-murdered' hillbilly, and the crew busy themselves reburying the landing jet they found and 'un-repairing' the damage to Starbug, which begins to become less rusted but more damaged as the reverse landing window approaches. When the time arrives, the crew begin the reverse landing, sending the underpowered ship scraping backwards over a nearby mountain, a process which repairs much of the damage as several landing jets leap from the forest and reattach themselves. With the craft still out of control, they are unstruck by a missile from the American 'Star Wars' defence system, which had misidentified Starbug as a threat. With the remainder of the damage repaired, the crew leave for their own universe to rendezvous with Red Dwarf, but find it to be missing without a trace. =The Search for Red Dwarf= Unknown to them, Holly, the Red Dwarf computer, has been reversing the process of his intelligence compression (performed in 'Better Than Life'), reducing his IQ to increase his operational lifespan. Unfortunately he takes the process too far, leaving him so stupid that he is unable to reverse the procedure or prevent Red Dwarf falling into the hands of the Agonoids, who force him to divulge information about the crew. Delighted to discover the one remaining human (Lister) is among them, the Agonoids begin to plan his demise, ripping Holly's components from the ship and jettisoning them before converting the Red Dwarf into a giant torture chamber. Discovering the remains of Holly, the Dwarf crew learn of the Agonoid threat, but with food and fuel supplies on Starbug severely low, and their power situation made even worse by the energy required to power up Holly's remains even for the brief time they spoke with him, they have no options available but to head for Red Dwarf regardless. At the same time, in a parallel universe, Ace Rimmer is preparing to test pilot a ship capable of crossing dimensions. The brave, heroic and charismatic Ace (a complete contrast to the neurotic Rimmer) arrives in the Red Dwarf timeline, materialising so close to Starbug as to severely damage both ships. Coming over to Starbug to help with repairs, Ace deduces it may be possible to rig up his ship to take the crew home. The Agonoids meanwhile are fighting for the right to torture and kill the last remaining human. Djuhn'Keep, the most intelligent Agonoid‚Äîhaving tricked and dismantled another for spare parts due to his own poor physical condition, only having been spared destruction so far due to his technical skills‚Äîsucceeds in jettisoning the others into space, but notices to his chagrin that one, Pizzak'Rapp, is headed directly for Starbug. Pizzak'Rapp attempts to break into the ship, but Ace sacrifices himself to send the Agonoid into space. Meanwhile, Djuhn'Keep arrives on Starbug, just as the oxygen supply fails. Horrified at losing the opportunity to torture Lister, Djuhn swiftly repairs the Oxygeneration unit. Kryten bazookoids the freshly repaired hull, causing a breach which sucks the Agonoid into space. The crew then learn that Djuhn has infected the ship's NaviComp with a computer virus (the Armageddon virus), causing them to be locked on course towards a nearby planet. Kryten decides to deliberately contract the virus to create an antidote, cryptically telling the crew to 'watch his dreams' before becoming unresponsive. Entering Kryten's dream-state through a VR machine, the crew find themselves in a replica of an old Western, with the various characters representing Kryten's characteristics ('Wyatt Memory', 'Billy Belief', etc.), being threatened by 'the Apocalypse boys', representing the virus. Kryten's consciousness is represented by the town lawman, Sheriff Carton, but the recent death of Wyatt Memory has cost Kryten his memory of what he is meant to be doing, although the crew are able to remind him of enough crucial details to finish his work. In order to buy Kryten time, the crew (Rimmer, Lister and The Cat), adopt personas from a VR Western game, Streets of Larado, and enter the game to assist him. With impeccable skills in fighting, knife-throwing and shooting provided by the VR machine, along with the knowledge that they can't be injured, they attempt to take on the Apocalypse boys to distract them from destroying the town or killing Sheriff Carton. However, the virus spreads to the VR machine the crew is connected to, sealing them into the artificial reality, removing their 'special skills' and allowing them to feel pain (Fortunately, Lister and Cat cannot be actually killed, although Rimmer's light bee is still potentially vulnerable to the virus). The crew clash with the Apocalypse boys regardless, and are subject to terrible injuries; Lister is even decapitated at one point. However, Kryten has enough time to complete the antidote program just as the Apocalypse boys gun him down. With the Apocalypse boys vapourised, Lister and The Cat return to reality to find the virus has killed both Kryten and Rimmer, destroying their mechanical components beyond repair. Since the VR machine only simulated their injuries, they find themselves unharmed. With the virus gone, they are able to control the ship, but since it has been accelerating for several hours there is not sufficient fuel left to avoid hitting the planet. Cramming into Ace's one-man ship Wildfire, which he had programmed for another jump, they cross dimensions‚Äîtheir only other option being to go back to an uninhabited and gutted Red Dwarf in this universe‚Äîfinding themselves in a timeline where Kryten and Rimmer are still alive, but their own counterparts died playing Better Than Life. As they dock with the alternate Red Dwarf, Lister reflects that while this isn't home, it might be close enough. Trivia * The audiobook version does not include the segment based on Gunmen of the Apocalypse and instead features Rimmer and Kryten dying during the fight with Djuhn'Keep; Rimmer's light bee falls out of the ship when the hull breaches and Kryten is crushed by falling debris. After Lister and the Cat find the ship locked in its deadly course they immediately commandeer Wildfire. It also skips the short chapter about Cat, losing (or in this case gaining) his virginity. * The glimpse into Ace's reality also reveals how his Lister is more mature than the version in the show; without Rimmer present on Red Dwarf, Lister's new roommate, Lewis Pemberton, was a more mature individual who helped encourage Lister's own development, helping him reconcile with Kochanski and starting him on the classes that led to him becoming the engineer he is when Ace meets him.

Morphometrics (from Greek ŒºŒøœÅœïŒÆ morphe, \\"shape, form\\", and -ŒºŒµœÑœÅŒØŒ± metria, \\"measurement\\") or morphometry refers to the quantitative analysis of form, a concept that encompasses size and shape. Morphometric analyses are commonly performed on organisms, and are useful in analyzing their fossil record, the impact of mutations on shape, developmental changes in form, covariances between ecological factors and shape, as well for estimating quantitative-genetic parameters of shape. Morphometrics can be used to quantify a trait of evolutionary significance, and by detecting changes in the shape, deduce something of their ontogeny, function or evolutionary relationships. A major objective of morphometrics is to statistically test hypotheses about the factors that affect shape. \\"Morphometrics\\", in the broader sense, is also used to precisely locate certain areas of organs such as the brain, and in describing the shapes of other things. Forms Standard measurements of birds Three general approaches to form are usually distinguished: traditional morphometrics, landmark-based morphometrics and outline-based morphometrics. =\\"Traditional\\" morphometrics= Traditional morphometrics analyzes lengths, widths, masses, angles, ratios and areas.Marcus, L. F. (1990). Chapter 4. Traditional morphometrics. In Proceedings of the Michigan Morphometric Workshop. Special Publication No. 2. F. J. Rohlf and F. L. Bookstein. Ann Arbor MI, The University of Michigan Museum of Zoology: 77‚Äì122. In general, traditional morphometric data are measurements of size. A drawback of using many measurements of size is that most will be highly correlated; as a result, there are few independent variables despite the many measurements. For instance, tibia length will vary with femur length and also with humerus and ulna length and even with measurements of the head. Traditional morphometric data are nonetheless useful when either absolute or relative sizes are of particular interest, such as in studies of growth. These data are also useful when size measurements are of theoretical importance such as body mass and limb cross-sectional area and length in studies of functional morphology. However, these measurements have one important limitation: they contain little information about the spatial distribution of shape changes across the organism. They are also useful when determining the extent to which certain pollutants have affected an individual. these indices include the hepatosomatic index, gonadosomatic index and also the condition factors (shakumbila, 2014). =Landmark-based geometric morphometrics= In landmark- based geometric morphometrics, the spatial information missing from traditional morphometrics is contained in the data, because the data are coordinates of landmarks: discrete anatomical loci that are arguably homologous in all individuals in the analysis (i.e. they can be regarded as the \\"same\\" point in each specimens in the study). For example, where two specific sutures intersect is a landmark, as are intersections between veins on an insect wing or leaf, or foramina, small holes through which veins and blood vessels pass. Landmark-based studies have traditionally analyzed 2D data, but with the increasing availability of 3D imaging techniques, 3D analyses are becoming more feasible even for small structures such as teeth. Finding enough landmarks to provide a comprehensive description of shape can be difficult when working with fossils or easily damaged specimens. That is because all landmarks must be present in all specimens, although coordinates of missing landmarks can be estimated. The data for each individual consists of a configuration of landmarks. There are three recognized categories of landmarks. Type 1 landmarks are defined locally, i.e. in terms of structures close to that point; for example, an intersection between three sutures, or intersections between veins on an insect wing are locally defined and surrounded by tissue on all sides. Type 3 landmarks, in contrast, are defined in terms of points far away from the landmark, and are often defined in terms of a point \\"furthest away\\" from another point. Type 2 landmarks are intermediate; this category includes points such as the tip structure, or local minima and maxima of curvature. They are defined in terms of local features, but they are not surrounded on all sides. In addition to landmarks, there are semilandmarks, points whose position along a curve is arbitrary but which provide information about curvature in two or three dimensions. Procrustes-based geometric morphometrics Shape analysis begins by removing the information that is not about shape. By definition, shape is not altered by translation, scaling or rotation. Thus, to compare shapes, the non- shape information is removed from the coordinates of landmarks. There is more than one way to do these three operations. One method is to fix the coordinates of two points to (0,0) and (0,1), which are the two ends of a baseline. In one step, the shapes are translated to the same position (the same two coordinates are fixed to those values), the shapes are scaled (to unit baseline length) and the shapes are rotated. An alternative, and preferred method, is Procrustes superimposition. This method translates the centroid of the shapes to (0,0); the x coordinate of the centroid is the average of the x coordinates of the landmarks, and the y coordinate of the centroid is the average of the y-coordinates. Shapes are scaled to unit centroid size, which is the square root of the summed squared distances of each landmark to the centroid. The configuration is rotated to minimize the deviation between it and a reference, typically the mean shape. In the case of semi-landmarks, variation in position along the curve is also removed. Because shape space is curved, analyses are done by projecting shapes onto a space tangent to shape space. Within the tangent space, conventional multivariate statistical methods such as multivariate analysis of variance and multivariate regression, can be used to test statistical hypotheses about shape. Procrustes-based analyses have some limitations. One is that the Procrustes superimposition uses a least-squares criterion to find the optimal rotation; consequently, variation that is localized to a single landmark will be smeared out across many. This is called the 'Pinocchio effect'. Another is that the superimposition may itself impose a pattern of covariation on the landmarks. Additionally, any information that cannot be captured by landmarks and semilandmarks cannot be analyzed, including classical measurements like \\"greatest skull breadth\\". Moreover, there are criticisms of Procrustes-based methods that motivate an alternative approach to analyzing landmark data. Euclidean distance matrix analysis Diffeomorphometry Diffeomorphometry is the focus on comparison of shapes and forms with a metric structure based on diffeomorphisms, and is central to the field of computational anatomy. Diffeomorphic registration, introduced in the 90s, is now an important player with existing codes bases organized around ANTS, DARTEL, DEMONS, LDDMM, StationaryLDDMM are examples of actively used computational codes for constructing correspondences between coordinate systems based on sparse features and dense images. Voxel-based morphometry(VBM) is an important technology built on many of these principles.Methods based on diffeomorphic flows are used in For example, deformations could be diffeomorphisms of the ambient space, resulting in the LDDMM (Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping) framework for shape comparison. On such deformations is the right invariant metric of Computational Anatomy which generalizes the metric of non-compressible Eulerian flows but to include the Sobolev norm ensuring smoothness of the flows, metrics have now been defined associated to Hamiltonian controls of diffeomorphic flows. =Outline analysis= The results of principal component analysis performed on an outline analysis of some thelodont denticles. Outline analysis is another approach to analyzing shape. What distinguishes outline analysis is that coefficients of mathematical functions are fitted to points sampled along the outline. There are a number of ways of quantifying an outline. Older techniques such as the \\"fit to a polynomial curve\\" and Principal components quantitative analysis have been superseded by the two main modern approaches: eigenshape analysis, and elliptical fourier analysis (EFA), using hand- or computer-traced outlines. The former involves fitting a preset number of semilandmarks at equal intervals around the outline of a shape, recording the deviation of each step from semilandmark to semilandmark from what the angle of that step would be were the object a simple circle.For an example \\"in use\\", see The latter defines the outline as the sum of the minimum number of ellipses required to mimic the shape.e.g. Both methods have their weaknesses; the most dangerous (and easily overcome) is their susceptibility to noise in the outline. Likewise, neither compares homologous points, and global change is always given more weight than local variation (which may have large biological consequences). Eigenshape analysis requires an equivalent starting point to be set for each specimen, which can be a source of error EFA also suffers from redundancy in that not all variables are independent. On the other hand, it is possible to apply them to complex curves without having to define a centroid; this makes removing the effect of location, size and rotation much simpler. The perceived failings of outline morphometrics are that it doesn't compare points of a homologous origin, and that it oversimplifies complex shapes by restricting itself to considering the outline and not internal changes. Also, since it works by approximating the outline by a series of ellipses, it deals poorly with pointed shapes. One criticism of outline-based methods is that they disregard homology ‚Äì a famous example of this disregard being the ability of outline-based methods to compare a scapula to a potato chip. Such a comparison which would not be possible if the data were restricted to biologically homologous points. An argument against that critique is that, if landmark approaches to morphometrics can be used to test biological hypotheses in the absence of homology data, it is inappropriate to fault outline-based approaches for enabling the same types of studies. Analyzing data Multivariate statistical methods can be used to test statistical hypotheses about factors that affect shape and to visualize their effects. To visualize the patterns of variation in the data, the data need to be reduced to a comprehensible (low- dimensional) form. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a commonly employed tool to do summarize the variation. Simply put, the technique projects as much of the overall variation as possible into a few dimensions. See the figure at the right for an example. Each axis on a PCA plot is an eigenvector of the covariance matrix of shape variables. The first axis accounts for maximum variation in the sample, with further axes representing further ways in which the samples vary. The pattern of clustering of samples in this morphospace represents similarities and differences in shapes, which can reflect phylogenetic relationships. As well as exploring patterns of variation, Multivariate statistical methods can be used to test statistical hypotheses about factors that affect shape and to visualize their effects, although PCA is not needed for this purpose unless the method requires inverting the variance-covariance matrix. Landmark data allow the difference between population means, or the deviation an individual from its population mean, to be visualized in at least two ways. One depicts vectors at landmarks that show the magnitude and direction in which that landmark is displaced relative to the others. The second depicts the difference via the thin plate splines, an interpolation function that models change between landmarks from the data of changes in coordinates of landmarks. This function produces what look like deformed grids; where regions that relatively elongated, the grid will look stretched and where those regions are relatively shortened, the grid will look compressed. Ecology and evolutionary biology D'Arcy Thompson in 1917 suggested that shapes in many different species could also be related in this way. In the case of shells and horns he gave a fairly precise analysis‚Ä¶ But he also drew various pictures of fishes and skulls, and argued that they were related by deformations of coordinates. Shape analysis is widely used in ecology and evolutionary biology to study plasticity, evolutionary changes in shape and in evolutionary developmental biology to study the evolution of the ontogeny of shape, as well as the developmental origins of developmental stability, canalization and modularity. Many other applications of shape analysis in ecology and evolutionary biology can be found in the introductory text: =Neuroimaging= In neuroimaging, the most common variants are voxel- based morphometry, deformation-based morphometry and surface-based morphometry of the brain. =Bone histomorphometry= Histomorphometry of bone involves obtaining a bone biopsy specimen and processing of bone specimens in the laboratory, obtaining estimates of the proportional volumes and surfaces occupied by different components of bone. First the bone is broken down by baths in highly concentrated ethanol and acetone. The bone is then embedded and stained so that it can be visualized/analyzed under a microscope. Obtaining a bone biopsy is accomplished by using a bone biopsy trephine. =Other applications= The application of morphometrics is not restricted to biological uses. It can also be applied to terrain in the form of geomorphometrics. It also has a host of other applications.

It is the most widespread species of stonefish, mostly found in shallow waters of the Red Sea and the Indo-Pacific. It is the deadliest fish in the sea, with incredibly effective venom which can be lethal to humans. This stonefish is usually brown or grey, and it may have areas of yellow, orange or red. This species reaches up to 30‚Äì40 centimeters long; a specimen of 51 centimeters has been recorded. Distribution and habitat This stonefish lives primarily above the Tropic of Capricorn. It is the most widespread species in the stonefish family, and is known from shallow tropical marine waters in the western Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean, ranging from the Red Sea and coastal East Africa to French Polynesia and southern Japan. There is also evidence showing that S. verrucosa occurs in the far eastern Mediterranean Sea, either through release of aquarium specimens or Lessepsian migration via the Suez Canal. The first documented individual was an adult that was captured in 2010 near Yavne, Israel. This fish lives in coral reefs. It may settle on and around rocks and plants, or rest on the seabed. Reef stonefish on the reef floor The reef stonefish has evolved many adaptations to help them succeed in the reef bottom. Their skin is rocky and uneven, which helps them hide and remain camouflaged in between rocks and corals. Among these adaptations are the 13 dorsal spines that protect the animal when necessary.  Feeding  The reef stonefish eats mostly small fish, shrimp and other crustaceans. It captures prey by sitting motionless on the reef floor and waiting for animals to swim by. The stonefish will then engulf its prey, doing so at incredible speeds. Some stonefish have been recorded striking their prey in .015 seconds. Human uses The primary commercial significance of this stonefish is as an aquarium pet. It is also sold for meat in Hong Kong markets. It is consumed in the Philippines, especially in Chinese restaurants, and in Japan. Toxicity Synanceia verrucosa in a public aquarium The reef stonefish is the most venomous fish in the world. Its dorsal area is lined with 13 spines, each of which has two venom sacs. The spines are sharp and stiff and have been known to pierce boot soles. Stonefish venom can be fatal at a dose of only 18mg, which the fish is capable of releasing with only six of its thirteen spines. The protein makeup differs between the three species of stonefish, but in reef stonefish the fatal protein is the verrucotoxin protein. Effects of the venom include severe pain, shock, paralysis, and tissue death. A large dose can be fatal to humans, generally young children, the elderly, and those with weakened immune systems. Medical treatment includes the antivenom. A local anesthetic can reduce the pain. First aid includes immersion of the affected limb in hot water; this is thought to help denature the proteins in the venom. The immobilization of venom at penetration site using a tourniquet or firm constrictive bandaging is no longer recommended. Surviving victims may have nerve damage, which can lead to local muscle atrophy. The venom consists of a mixture of proteins, including the hemolytic stonustoxin, the proteinaceous verrucotoxin, and the cardiotoxic cardioleputin.  Reproduction  The reef stonefish lives most of its life as a solitary animal, and during mating season only aggregates with the opposite sex for a short time. When a female stonefish has reached sexual maturity, she will lay her unfertilized eggs on the floor of the reef. A male will then swim by and release sperm onto the layer of eggs, fertilizing them. Stonefish eggs are fairly large, with young fish hatching well developed. The mating system of the reef stonefish is promiscuity, as the female will not discriminate between which males can lay their sperm on the egg layer. Sexual dimorphism is apparent in reef stonefish, with females being larger than males. References External links * Synanceia verrucosa.

S. Naipaul. Mostly an autobiography, the book is composed of five sections that reflect the growing familiarity and changing perceptions of Naipaul upon his arrival in various countries after leaving his native Trinidad and Tobago. Most of the action of the novel takes place in Wiltshire, England, where Naipaul has rented a cottage in the countryside. On first arriving, he sees the area surrounding his cottage as a frozen piece of history, unchanged for hundreds of years. However, as his stay at the cottage where he is working on another book becomes extended, he begins to see the area for what it is: a constantly changing place with ordinary people simply living lives away from the rest of the world. This causes Naipaul to reflect upon the nature of our perceptions of our surroundings and how much these perceptions are affected by our own pre-conceptions of a place.

The waltz had earlier been intended to be dedicated for the occasion of the annual ball of the Vienna Authors' and Journalists' Association 'Concordia' ball held at the Sofienbad-saal ballroom on 21 January 1866. For the Fasching of 1866, Strauss had dedicated three new waltzes and 'Flugschriften' belongs to one of the composer's inspired creations in 3/4 time. The waltz begins with a plaintive Introduction with clarinets and oboes. As the music progresses, the mood became tense and a short chord interrupts, heralding the graceful 1st waltz section. The plaintive mood was reintroduced in the 2nd waltz section before an exuberant 3rd section. Further melodies are introduced but such were the musical ideas of the work that it would not be triumphant and joyful. The coda recalls earlier waltz sections, rounded up by the re-entry of the first waltz section and a spirited close with a snare drumroll and regular brass flourish. The waltz also inspired Antal Dor√°ti to include the 2nd waltz section and the coda in his 1940 pastiche ballet 'Graduation Ball'.

It forms on the surface of low-melting-point metals such as tin, lead, zinc or aluminium or alloys by oxidation of the metal. For higher melting point metals such as steel, oxidized impurities melt and float making them easy to pour off. With wrought iron, hammering and later rolling removed some dross. With tin and lead the dross can be removed by adding sodium hydroxide pellets, which dissolve the oxides and form a slag. If floating, dross can also be skimmed off. Dross, as a solid, is distinguished from slag, which is a liquid. Dross product is not entirely waste material; for example, aluminium dross can be recycled and is used in secondary steelmaking for slag deoxidation. Etymology and usage The term dross derives from the Old English word dros, meaning the scum produced when smelting metals (extracting them from their ores). By the 15th century it had come to refer to rubbish in general. Dregs, and the geological term druse are also thought to be etymologically related. Popular non- metalworking uses of the word are derogatory: *poorly written or plagiarized journalism - \\"a dross article\\"; \\"utter/complete/terrible dross\\" (adjective/noun), a stronger term than filler *undesirable, unprofitable work - \\"let's home in on the lion's share and outsource the dross\\"; synonyms: corv√©e, hiding-to-nothing, and drudgery which are growing anarchisms in business\\"dross\\" en.wiktionary.org (noun); as strong a term as dogsbody work See also *Aluminium alloy inclusions *Slag References External links *AZoM.com ‚Äì Aluminium Dross Recycling * Herbert F.

The station, which primarily broadcasts pop and rock music, is the successor to the East German youth station DT64, founded in 1964 on the occasion of the Deutschlandtreffen der Jugend (de). It was given its present name on 1 May 1993, following German reunification in 1990; the new name, inspired by the Soviet Sputnik satellite, was the suggestion of the then Saxon prime minister, Kurt Biedenkopf. While DT64 was broadcast throughout East Germany, Sputnik is available on FM only in one of the five federal states which replaced the GDR and thus only in one of the three federal states that form MDR's coverage area (Saxony-Anhalt); it is available throughout Europe via the Astra satellite on 19.2¬∞ east in DVB-S standard as well as on most German cable networks on DVB-C and in the MDR area (Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia) on FM and on DAB+. DT64 lost all FM frequencies in the first half of 1992. In four new federal states these frequencies were given to private radio stations, in Berlin and Brandenburg a new public youth radio station (Rock Radio B, later Fritz) started on the frequencies DT64. DT64 had to switch to AM in summer 1992. AM transmissions lasted for one year. The station was renamed MDR Sputnik. Between 1993 and 1997 MDR Sputnik was available only via Astra satellite analog audio subcarriers and a special German digital Radio System DSR, receivable via cable and satellite. In 1997 FM coverage in Saxony-Anhalt was increased. The station lost most of its news and spoken word content. In December 2006, the station was relaunched as a high quality youth station, under new station manager Eric Markuse. English news bulletins were added between 1.30 P.M. and 6.30 P.M. Various other news content returned, as well as more diverse music, especially independent music. In summer 2010 MDR cut its budget again: English news and most news content ceased, station manager Eric Markuse left. Today (2014) Sputnik is a standard music station.

V. O. Quine) is a collection of philosophic views concerned with the theory of knowledge that emphasize the role of natural scientific methods. This shared emphasis on scientific methods of studying knowledge shifts focus to the empirical processes of knowledge acquisition and away from many traditional philosophical questions. There are noteworthy distinctions within naturalized epistemology. Replacement naturalism maintains that traditional epistemology should be abandoned and replaced with the methodologies of the natural sciences. The general thesis of cooperative naturalism is that traditional epistemology can benefit in its inquiry by using the knowledge we have gained from the cognitive sciences. Substantive naturalism focuses on an asserted equality of facts of knowledge and natural facts. Objections to naturalized epistemology have targeted features of the general project as well as characteristics of specific versions. Some objectors suggest that natural scientific knowledge cannot be circularly grounded by the knowledge obtained through cognitive science, which is itself a natural science. This objection from circularity has been aimed specifically at strict replacement naturalism. There are similar challenges to substance naturalism that maintain that the substance naturalists' thesis that all facts of knowledge are natural facts is not only circular but fails to accommodate certain facts. Several other objectors have found fault in the inability of naturalized methods to adequately address questions about what value forms of potential knowledge have or lack. Naturalized epistemology is generally opposed to the antipsychologism of Immanuel Kant, Gottlob Frege, Karl Popper, Edmund Husserl and others. Forms of naturalism =Replacement naturalism= W. V. O. Quine's version of naturalized epistemology considers reasons for serious doubt about the fruitfulness of traditional philosophic study of scientific knowledge. These concerns are raised in light of the long attested incapacity of philosophers to find a satisfactory answer to the problems of radical scepticism, more particularly, to David Hume's criticism of induction. But also, because of the contemporaneous attempts and failures to reduce mathematics to pure logic by those in or philosophically sympathetic to The Vienna Circle. He concludes that studies of scientific knowledge concerned with meaning or truth fail to achieve the Cartesian goal of certainty. The failures in the reduction of mathematics to pure logic imply that scientific knowledge can at best be defined with the aid of less certain set-theoretic notions. Even if set theory's lacking the certainty of pure logic is deemed acceptable, the usefulness of constructing an encoding of scientific knowledge as logic and set theory is undermined by the inability to construct a useful translation from logic and set-theory back to scientific knowledge. If no translation between scientific knowledge and the logical structures can be constructed that works both ways, then the properties of the purely logical and set-theoretic constructions do not usefully inform understanding of scientific knowledge. On Quine's account, attempts to pursue the traditional project of finding the meanings and truths of science philosophically have failed on their own terms and failed to offer any advantage over the more direct methods of psychology. Quine rejects the analytic-synthetic distinction and emphasizes the holistic nature of our beliefs. Since traditional philosophic analysis of knowledge fails, those wishing to study knowledge ought to employ natural scientific methods. Scientific study of knowledge differs from philosophic study by focusing on how humans acquire knowledge rather than speculative analysis of knowledge. According to Quine, this appeal to science to ground the project of studying knowledge, which itself underlies science, should not be dismissed for its circularity since it is the best option available after ruling out traditional philosophic methods for their more serious flaws. This identification and tolerance of circularity is reflected elsewhere in Quine's works. =Cooperative naturalism= Cooperative naturalism is a version of naturalized epistemology which states that while there are evaluative questions to pursue, the empirical results from psychology concerning how individuals actually think and reason are essential and useful for making progress in these evaluative questions. This form of naturalism says that our psychological and biological limitations and abilities are relevant to the study of human knowledge. Empirical work is relevant to epistemology but only if epistemology is itself as broad as the study of human knowledge. =Substantive naturalism= Substantive naturalism is a form of naturalized epistemology that emphasizes how all epistemic facts are natural facts. Natural facts can be based on two main ideas. The first is that all natural facts include all facts that science would verify. The second is to provide a list of examples that consists of natural items. This will help in deducing what else can be included. Criticism Quine articulates the problem of circularity inherent in naturalized epistemology when it is treated as a replacement for traditional epistemology. If the goal of traditional epistemology is to validate or to provide the foundation for the natural sciences, naturalized epistemology would be tasked with validating the natural sciences by means of those very sciences. That is, an empirical investigation into the criteria which are used to scientifically evaluate evidence must presuppose those very same criteria. However, Quine points out that these thoughts of validation are merely a byproduct of traditional epistemology. Instead, the naturalized epistemologist should only be concerned with understanding the link between observation and science even if that understanding relies on the very science under investigation. In order to understand the link between observation and science, Quine's naturalized epistemology must be able to identify and describe the process by which scientific knowledge is acquired. One form of this investigation is reliabilism which requires that a belief be the product of some reliable method if it is to be considered knowledge. Since naturalized epistemology relies on empirical evidence, all epistemic facts which comprise this reliable method must be reducible to natural facts. That is, all facts related to the process of understanding must be expressible in terms of natural facts. If this is not true, i.e. there are facts which cannot be expressed as natural facts, science would have no means of investigating them. In this vein, Roderick Chisholm argues that there are epistemic principles (or facts) which are necessary to knowledge acquisition, but may not be, themselves, natural facts. If Chisholm is correct, naturalized epistemology would be unable to account for these epistemic principles and, as a result, would be unable to wholly describe the process by which knowledge is obtained. Beyond Quine's own concerns and potential discrepancies between epistemic and natural facts, Hilary Putnam argues that the replacement of traditional epistemology with naturalized epistemology necessitates the elimination of the normative. But without the normative, there is no \\"justification, rational acceptability [nor] warranted assertibility\\". Ultimately, there is no \\"true\\" since any method for arriving at the truth was abandoned with the normative. All notions which would explain truth are only intelligible when the normative is presupposed. Moreover, for there to be \\"thinkers\\", there \\"must be some kind of truth\\"; otherwise, \\"our thoughts aren't really about anything [,...] there is no sense in which any thought is right or wrong\\". Without the normative to dictate how one should proceed or which methods should be employed, naturalized epistemology cannot determine the \\"right\\" criteria by which empirical evidence should be evaluated. But these are precisely the issues which traditional epistemology has been tasked with. If naturalized epistemology does not provide the means for addressing these issues, it cannot succeed as a replacement to traditional epistemology. Jaegwon Kim, another critic of naturalized epistemology, further articulates the difficulty of removing the normative component. He notes that modern epistemology has been dominated by the concepts of justification and reliability. Kim explains that epistemology and knowledge are nearly eliminated in their common sense meanings without normative concepts such as these. These concepts are meant to engender the question \\"What conditions must a belief meet if we are justified in accepting it as true?\\". That is to say, what are the necessary criteria by which a particular belief can be declared as \\"true\\" (or, should it fail to meet these criteria, can we rightly infer its falsity)? This notion of truth rests solely on the conception and application of the criteria which are set forth in traditional and modern theories of epistemology. Kim adds to this claim by explaining how the idea of \\"justification\\" is the only notion (among \\"belief\\" and \\"truth\\") which is the defining characteristic of an epistemological study. To remove this aspect is to alter the very meaning and goal of epistemology, whereby we are no longer discussing the study and acquisition of knowledge. Justification is what makes knowledge valuable and normative; without it what can rightly be said to be true or false? We are left with only descriptions of the processes by which we arrive at a belief. Kim realizes that Quine is moving epistemology into the realm of psychology, where Quine‚Äôs main interest is based on the sensory input‚Äìoutput relationship of an individual. This account can never establish an affirmable statement which can lead us to truth, since all statements without the normative are purely descriptive (which can never amount to knowledge). The vulgar allowance of any statement without discrimination as scientifically valid, though not true, makes Quine‚Äôs theory difficult to accept under any epistemic theory which requires truth as the object of knowledge. As a result of these objections and others like them, most, including Quine in his later writings, have agreed that naturalized epistemology as a replacement may be too strong of a view. However, these objections have helped shape rather than completely eliminate naturalized epistemology. One product of these objections is cooperative naturalism which holds that empirical results are essential and useful to epistemology. That is, while traditional epistemology cannot be eliminated, neither can it succeed in its investigation of knowledge without empirical results from the natural sciences. In any case, Quinean Replacement Naturalism finds relatively few supporters.

The University of San Carlos was originally founded as Colegio de San Ildefonso a primary and secondary education school. It was established by Spanish Jesuit missionaries Antonio Sedeno, Pedro Chirino and Antonio Pereira in 1595. Except for a brief period in the 18th century, the institution of education has remained in constant operation for over 400 years, obtaining university status in 1948. It was closed in 1769 at the expulsion of the Jesuits. In 1783, Bishop Mateo Joaquin de Arevalo initiated the opening of the Colegio-Seminario de San Carlos. In 1852, the management of the college was entrusted to the Dominican Christian priests, replaced in 1867 by the Vincentian Fathers then, in 1935, the Societas Verbi Divini or the Society of the Divine Word (SVD). The Second World War led to the interruption of the operation of the school in 1941 because several buildings suffered various degrees of destruction. The school reopened as repairs of the damaged buildings which started in 1945 were completed by 1946. The Colegio de San Carlos (CSC) was granted its university charter in 1948. The University was named after San Carlos Borromeo.About USC ‚Äì University of San Carlos . Usc.edu.ph. Retrieved on 2012-04-24. However, this position is contested by scholars. According to Fr. Aloysius Cartagenas, a professor at the Seminario Mayor de San Carlos of Cebu, ‚Äúfollowing Church tradition, the foundation event and date of University of San Carlos should be the decree of Bishop Romualdo Jimeno on 15 May 1867 (turning over the seminary to the Congregation of the Missions) and the first day of classes in the history of what is now USC is 1 July 1867, the day P. Jose Casarramona welcomed the first lay students to attend classes at the Seminario de San Carlos.‚Äù Thus, he says that San Carlos cannot claim to have descended from the Colegio de San Ildefonso founded by the Jesuits in 1595, despite taking over the latter's facilities when the Jesuits were expelled by Spanish authorities in 1769. According to him there is ‚Äúno visible and clear link‚Äù between Colegio de San Ildefonso and USC. San Carlos was specifically for the training of diocesan priests, and it simply took over the facility of the former, a Jesuit central house with an attached day school. The university, as an autonomous institute as per the modern definition of a university, started to function in 1867. Though claims have been made to its origin as an autonomous institute at the time of opening of a seminary as a religious school of indoctrination in 1783. University even stretches the claim of its origin back to founding of another center of religious teaching in 1595, which was later closed down. Thus claims about being the oldest, and being a university in its earlier versions or the claims of using shut down institutes as its constituents are concocted and disputed. In 2010, the National Historical Commission of the Philippines installed a bronze marker declaring USC's foundation late in the 18th Century, effectively disproving any direct connection with the Colegio de San Ildefonso.NHCP historical marker for University of San Carlos in Cebu City 'National Historical Commission of the Philippines marker' accessed 19 April 2020 According to Dr. Victor Torres of the De La Salle University, the University of San Carlos' claim dates back to 1948 only when USC was declared a University.No contest: UST is oldest university 'Philippine Daily Inquirer' Accessed 19 April 2020 Fidel Villarroel from the University of Santo Tomas argued that USC only took over the facility of the former Colegio de San Ildefonso and that there is no 'visible' and 'clear' link between San Carlos and San Ildefonso.UST is oldest, period 'The Varsitarian' Accessed 19 April 2020 In 2010, the National Historical Commission of the Philippines installed a bronze marker declaring USC's foundation late in the 18th Century, effectively disproving any direct connection with the Colegio de San Ildefonso.NHCP historical marker for University of San Carlos in Cebu City 'National Historical Commission of the Philippines marker' accessed 19 April 2020 =Later history= Facade of the old main building in Downtown Campus In 1924, Colegio-Seminario de San Carlos was split into two by virtue of a Vatican decree that seminaries should only be for priestly training. One of the schools that emerged from this split was named San Carlos College. In the 1930s, the San Carlos college moved to a different location, P. Del Rosario Street, while the seminary remained at Martires Street. The Society of the Divine Word took over the college in 1935. The Second World War saw the closure and occupation of CSC by Japanese troops. Shortly before Liberation, in 1944, bombs from US planes fell on San Carlos, almost reducing the school to rubbles. San Carlos became a university in 1948, three years after it reopened. The seminary, meanwhile, was returned to diocesan control in 1998. Following Communist persecution of the foreign clergy in China in 1949, the University of San Carlos would benefit from the migration of SVD priest- scholars to the Philippines. This accidental √©migr√© culture in USC spawned pioneering research in anthropology, physics, engineering, philosophy, and other fields, in the Philippines. This would have tremendous impact on the nation's Post-War reconstruction. Rapid expansion of the University during the 1960s under the leadership of foreign priest-academicians came with the decade's wave of militant nationalism, which culminated in calls for the Filipinization of the administration of all Catholic schools in the country. In 1970, Fr. Amante Castillo became the first Filipino president of USC.

Research USC is recognized as a research and innovation hub in southern Philippines. The university has drawn in external grants amounting to about PHP130M (US$2.5M) from 2011 to 2018. Internal research grants of about PHP37M (US$700T) have also been awarded from the University Research Trust Fund within the same time period, while an additional PHP350M (US$7M) has been earmarked for laboratory development anticipating the current changes in the Philippine educational system. Research efforts are supported by a print collection of over 200,000 titles and almost 10,000 non-print volumes housed in the University's Library System, along with subscriptions to 17 online journals. USC also publishes two respected scholarly journals, The Philippine Scientist and the Philippine Quarterly of Culture and Society. Additional support for researchers are available through offices or committees providing ethics review, intellectual property and innovation and technology support, and animal care and use. Twenty patents have been filed by the university with the Intellectual Property Office of the Philippines (IPOPHL) from 2012 to 2018, and one start- up company, Green Enviro Management Systems (GEMS), Inc., has been established.

It happened when the students launched its first strike against the administration to reinstate the student council and the student publication of the USC. The students were victorious in reinstating the Student Government. The latter eventually brought back the student publication in September 1983. After some time in the early 2000s, the publication was shut down again and, with the efforts of the university's supreme student council, re-emerged in 2012. = USC Press = The USC Press is the official academic publishing house of the University of San Carlos. Since 1975 to present the university had published about 500 volumes of research journals and about 110 books of academic researches of the faculty, scholars, alumni and partners.

Criticisms and Controversies  = Resumption of Classes during COVID-19 Lockdown = On April 26, 2020, during Cebu City's initial ECQ as a response to COVID-19, a newspaper column by broadcaster Bobby Nalzaro worried over a reported announcement by University of San Carlos (USC) that classes in all levels of the Cebu-based school would reopen on May 4, which is barely a week after the ECQ was to end under the city's original lockdown schedule of April 28. However, on April 22, Cebu City Mayor Edgar Labella reset the lifting of an ECQ (or enhanced community quarantine in the city) to May 15. President Duterte also approved the May 15 emergency task force (or IATF-EID) recommendation for Cebu City and Cebu Province, among other cities and provinces outside Luzon. This announcement by the school sparked a large online backlash from the students, which expanded to backlash from other concerned parties after the extension was announced.

Front right is Telford Taylor (Chief Counsel). Across the table from him is Clark Denney (Chief Trial Counsel). Immediately to Taylor's right is Henry T. King (Assistant Counsel). The Milch Trial (or officially, The United States of America vs. Erhard Milch) was the second of the twelve trials for war crimes the U.S. authorities held in their occupation zone in Germany in Nuremberg after the end of World War II. These twelve trials were all held before U.S. military courts, not before the International Military Tribunal, but took place in the same rooms at the Palace of Justice. The twelve U.S. trials are collectively known as the \\"Subsequent Nuremberg Trials\\" or, more formally, as the \\"Trials of War Criminals before the Nuremberg Military Tribunals\\" (NMT). In the Milch trial, former Field Marshal of the Luftwaffe Erhard Milch was accused of having committed war crimes and crimes against humanity. The indictment was presented on November 14, 1946.NMT Vol. II, p. 360. The charges against Milch were summarized by Michael A. Musmanno (one of the tribunal judges) as follows:Musmanno, Michael A. (1947). \\"Concurring Opinion by Judge Michael A. Musmanno\\" #Erhard Milch is charged with having knowingly committed war crimes as principal and accessory in enterprises involving slave labor and having also willingly and knowingly participated in enterprises involving the use of prisoners of war in war operations contrary to international convention and the laws and customs of war. #The defendant is accused of having knowingly and willfully participated in enterprises involving fatal medical experiments upon subjects without their consent. #In the third count the defendant is charged with responsibility for slave labor and fatal medical experiments, in the same manner as indicated in the first two counts, except that here the alleged victims are declared to be German nationals and nationals of other countries. The judges in his case, heard before Military Tribunal II, were Robert M. Toms (presiding judge) from Detroit, Michigan, Fitzroy Donald Phillips from North Carolina, Michael A. Musmanno from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and John J. Speight from Alabama (as an alternate judge). The Chief of Counsel for the Prosecution was Telford Taylor, and the Chief Trial Counsel was Clark Denney. The assistant counsel for the prosecution included James S. Conway, Dorothy M. Hunt, Henry T. King, Jr., Raymond J. McMahon, Jr., and Maurice C. Myers. The defense counsels were Friedrich Bergold and Werner Milch (the brother of the defendant). Milch pleaded \\"not guilty\\" on all charges on December 20, 1946. The trial lasted from January 2, 1947 until April 17, 1947. The tribunal found Milch guilty on counts 1 and 3, but acquitted him on count 2 of the indictment. On April 17, 1947, Milch was sentenced to life imprisonment at Rebdorf Prison, near Munich. The sentence was commuted by John J. McCloy, High Commissioner of Germany, to 15 years of imprisonment in 1951. Milch was paroled in June 1954.\\"Milch Case Overview\\" , webpage of the Harvard Law School Library Nuremberg Trials Project . Retrieved October 16, 2007.King, Henry T.

During his incarceration, Milch filed an application for leave to file a petition for a writ of habeas corpus before the United States Supreme Court. The Court denied leave on jurisdictional grounds by a vote of 4-4, with four justices (JJ.

The Baywalk is a two-kilometre stretch from the US Embassy near Rizal Park up to the Cultural Center of the Philippines just past the Manila Yacht Club. It is a popular venue at night with open-air caf√©s that serve local cuisine while onlookers may watch the Manila sunset. Many of the venues also feature music and live band performances. Local artists frequent the area and free mime, acrobatics, and other art performances can sometimes be found along the strip. However, when Mayor Alfredo Lim took office in 2007, he removed the establishments along Baywalk. Since then, vagrants have occupied the area and the once vibrant seaside promenade was gone.

The waltz was composed during a tour of the composer in Italy where he travelled with the Langenbach Orchestra of Germany and performed the work at the Teatro Regio in Turin on 9 May 1874.

Fourteen television ads and radio and print advertising depicted a fictional suburban forty-something middle-class married couple, portrayed by actors Harry Johnson and Louise Caire Clark, despairing over bureaucratic and other aspects of health care reform plans and urging viewers to contact their representatives in Congress. The commercials were ordered by HIAA president Bill Gradison and HIAA executive vice president Chip Kahn, and created by California public relations consultants Ben Goddard and Rick Claussen of Goddard Claussen. The couple returned in several newer advertisements pushing health care reform during the 2000 and 2004 presidential campaigns. In 2000, Harry and Louise appeared in a TV commercial sponsored by HIAA promoting its \\"InsureUSA\\" campaign advocating the need to provide health coverage to uninsured Americans. Later, they returned in an unrelated 2002 ad, produced by Goddard Claussen Porter Novelli (Goddard Claussen was purchased by Porter Novelli in 1999), advocating human cloning for therapeutic purposes on behalf of CuresNow.org. The second ad was the subject of a lawsuit by the HIAA who claimed that they owned the characters; however, a court ruled that the rights to the characters were held by Goddard Claussen, and it aired during a showing of The West Wing on NBC. This ad was one of several prominent political attack ads parodied in the 78th Academy Awards (March 2006). An older couple sitting at the kitchen table bemoans the \\"foreign-sounding names\\" of the best actress nominees, then praises Reese Witherspoon for having an all-American name. Harry and Louise appeared again in an ad that premiered on August 25, 2008, during the 2008 Democratic National Convention, urging that health care reform be made a top priority. The ad aired again during the Republican National Convention. The 2008 ad was sponsored by several organizations that have, in the past, advocated diverse views on health care, including The American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, the American Hospital Association, the Catholic Health Association, Families USA, and the National Federation of Independent Business.

The term anthrobotics was originally coined by Mark Rosheim in a paper entitled \\"Design of An Omnidirectional Arm\\" presented at the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, May 13‚Äì18, 1990, pp. 2162‚Äì2167. Rosheim says he derived the term from \\"...Anthropomorphic and Robotics to distinguish the new generation of dexterous robots from its simple industrial robot forebears.\\" The word gained wider recognition as a result of its use in the title of Rosheim's subsequent book Robot Evolution: The Development of Anthrobotics, which focussed on facsimiles of human physical and psychological skills and attributes. However, a wider definition of the term anthrobotics has been proposed, in which the meaning is derived from anthropology rather than anthropomorphic. This usage includes robots that respond to input in a human-like fashion, rather than simply mimicking human actions, thus theoretically being able to respond more flexibly or to adapt to unforeseen circumstances. This expanded definition also encompasses robots that are situated in social environments with the ability to respond to those environments appropriately, such as insect robots, robotic pets, and the like. Anthrobotics is now taught at some universities, encouraging students not only to design and build robots for environments beyond current industrial applications, but also to speculate on the future of robotics that are embedded in the world at large, as mobile phones and computers are today. In 2016 philosopher Luis de Miranda created the Anthrobotics Cluster at the University of Edinburgh \\"a platform of cross- disciplinary research that seeks to investigate some of the biggest questions that will need to be answered\\" on the relationship between humans, robots and intelligent systems and \\"a think tank on the social spread of robotics, and also how automation is part of the definition of what humans have always been\\". to explore the symbiotic relationship between humans and automated protocols.

His book \\"Slavonic Grammar with Correct Syntax\\" (1619) systematized the study of Church Slavonic and, according to Vinokur, \\"became the standard grammar book in Russia right up till the end of the 18th century.\\" He believed in the revival of the Orthodox religion in traditionally Slavic lands (see Slavic people) centered in the Tsardom of Russia. General Born in Smotrych, Podilia, Meletius was a son of the famous writer and pedagogue Herasym Smotrytsky. He received his first formal education at the Ostroh Academy, where his father was a rector. The academy is the oldest institution of higher learning in Eastern Europe. Later, he studied at Vilnius University, a Jesuit institution, between approximately 1596 and 1600. After that, Smotrytsky traveled through Europe, continuing his education at universities in Leipzig, Wittenberg and Nuremberg. In 1608, Meletius returned to Vilnius where he became a member of a local fraternity. Under his pen name Theophile Ortologue he wrote his famous polemic \\"Thrynos\\". Sometime in 1615-18 Smotrytsky was a teacher of Church Slavonic and Latin in the newly established Kiev Fraternity School. Subsequently, he became one of its first rectors. In 1616, he published a Ruthenian translation of \\"Teacher's Gospel... of Calisto\\" and in 1615 in Cologne he published a Greek-language grammar. In 1618, Smotrytsky returned to Vilnius where at the Holy Spirit Monastery he took vows as a monk and assumed the name Miletius. There, in the city of Vievis, he participated in publishing Dictionary of the Slavic Language (1618), and later, in 1619, Slavonic Grammar with Correct Syntax. In 1620, Meletius Smotrytsky became the Archbishop of Polotsk (Metropolitan of Kiev), bishop of Vitebsk and Mstyslaw. Around that time he published several anti-Union (see Union of Brest) works for which he was persecuted by the Polish authorities. During 1624 Smotrytsky traveled to Constantinople, Egypt, Palestine, after which in 1625 he returned to Kiev. Eventually, by 1627. he sided with followers of the Union and became the Archimandrite of the . Pope Urban VIII granted Smotrytsky the title of (titular) Archbishop of Hierapolis. Smotrytsky is buried at the Derman Monastery. Conversion to Catholicism \\"What is a letter?...\\" from the first edition of Smotrytsky's grammar Catholic and Orthodox authors have long debated Smotrytsky's reasons for abandoning Orthodoxy and converting to the Uniate Church. Uniate Catholics have argued that the conversion was a miracle based on the intercession of Martyr Saint Josaphat Kuntsevych. This explanation, first advanced by Josyf Veliamyn Rutsky, appears in the papal Bull of Pope Pius IX canonizing Kuncewicz. Smotrytysky also compared himself with Paul of Tarsus, suddenly relapsed after the stoning of Saint Stephen. Orthodox Christians, in turn, attributed his conversion to worldly reasons: alleging that he was tempted by the money and prestige of an imminent appointment as Abbot of a Uniate monastery in Dermaniu. The former archbishop of Polotsk was portrayed as a traitor to the true faith, and was compared with Judas or Martin Luther. Against Meletius Smotrytsky a whole group of Orthodox pamphlets was written. In his letters, he rarely referred to his reasons for changing his religion, contrasting instead the \\"old\\" and \\"new\\" Smotrytsky. He suggested that before his conversion he was not sure what he really believed, while his adoption of Catholicism restored his confidence in this regard. He also gave different dates for his decision to accept the Union, from 1623 (before leaving for Constantinople) up to 1628. He said that since 1615 he had waged an internal battle, growing stronger in the course of writing his own texts; in them he defended the Orthodox dogma with diminishing conviction, suggesting that, even before chirotoniƒÖ, the bishop did not agree with the spirit of brotherhood following his anti-Uniate publication from Vilnius. A number of scholars claim that Archbishop Meletius decided to convert to the Union under the influence of disenchantment which earned him a trip to Constantinople. This decision was the result of a deep spiritual crisis and the ultimate belief that the only thing that could help the revival of the Ruthenian people and culture was binding ancient Rus' lands with the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian state, and union of the churches. Mironowicz claims that Smotrytsky's disappointing experience with a trip to two of the ancient patriarchates meant that he decided to devote all his strength to the union \\"of Rus\\" in one Uniate Church. On July 6, 1627 Meletius Smotrytsky sent a letter to Pope Urban VIII, asking for forgiveness of his sins and acceptance into the Catholic Church. A second letter was addressed to Cardinal Ottavio Bandini, which promised that from then on he would not stray \\"even a hair's breadth\\" from the Catholic faith. On July 10, 1627 Uniate Archbishop Josyf Veliamyn Rutsky was instructed in a letter from the pope to convert Meletius Smotrytsky. The fact is that the profession of faith by a former Orthodox archbishop and polemicist was even then being kept secret. Smotrystsky asked the pope for permission to temporarily keep his Orthodox titles and duties apparent in a separate letter sent at the same time as the letter requesting admission to the Catholic Church. As Uniate Bishop Following the adoption of the Union Smotrytsky was a huge advocate of complete reunification of the Church. He hid the fact that he had already converted to the Union. His attitude, however, began to raise suspicions among the clergy. While retaining his popularity among the priests and faithful in Belarus, he lost trust among both the Vilnius fraternity and Kiev monks in monasteries. At the same time, Catholics were not yet convinced that Smotrytsky maintained full fidelity to his recently adopted Catholicism. On April 8, 1628, Cardinal Ludovisi in a letter to Alexander Zas≈Çawski demanded that the minister make a public profession of the Catholic faith. Smotrycki by then no longer resided in Vilnius, but in a monastery in Derman. The events that led to the final disclosure of Smotrytsky's conversion to Catholicism are known from a number of documents originating from himself or from his Orthodox opponents. Smotrytsky claimed that for the first time after conversion he had met with the Orthodox bishops of the Republic during the celebration of the Nativity of Our Lady in 1627 in Kiev. The meeting was also attended by Peter Mogila, who was still a layman. Mogila and Archbishop Job asked Smotrycki to show them the catechism which the Patriarch of Constantinople had presented. The next meeting of the hierarchy took place on the sixth Sunday of Lent in Horodku, on property belonging to the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra. It was attended, in addition to Meletius Smotrytsky, by the Metropolitan Job, Bishop Isaac of Lutsk, Chelm Paisjusz and Peter Mogila, who was already igumen in the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra. Smotrytsky delivered a speech at the meeting, discussing the six basic differences between the two confessions. Then the assembled council decided to convene the Orthodox Church in Kiev; not only the clergy had taken part in it, but also representatives of the Orthodox nobility and bourgeoisie. The bishops agreed to present at the Council a draft union for the Orthodox and Uniate Churches. Hierarchs agreed thereby that contrary to earlier findings, Meletius Smotrycki published no new treaty discussing the differences between the rival churches. Smotrytsky later argued that both Metropolitan Job and Peter Mogila allowed for the conclusion of a new union. It was not until a great anti-union stance by the Cossacks in attendance at the council to Kiev that they were prompted to change their position. Smotrycki was increasingly suspected of pro-Uniate sympathies. Therefore, after his arrival in Kiev he was not accommodated in Pechersk Lavra and had to live in the monastery of St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery. The priest wrote that he had been in the council visited by representatives of the Cossacks, who threatened him with death, in the event that the Orthodox hierarchy agreed to join the union. His design of a new union of church and arguments for the introduction signed the Treaty of Apology peregrinated to Eastern countries. Discussion on Smotrytsky's projects of union were held at the Kyiv council without the participation of Cossack delegates. Smotrytsky was accused of preaching heresy, including Sabellianism and Manichaeism. Smotrytsky's works that occurred in the years 1628-1629 were also repeatedly criticized publicly by the Orthodox monks. This meant the failure of pro-union initiatives, although projects to unite the two Churches were still presented in the following years. Smotrytsky's arguments in favor of union were presented again in 1629 published in Paraenensis, but were not supported by Orthodox Bishops. Smotrycki was considered Orthodox bishop in January 1629 (Joseph Bobrykowicz was even then his deputy in the office of the monastery of Saint Spirit in Vilnius), but a few months later the Orthodox clearly recognized him as a traitor, who renounced his former profession of private material benefits. Also the Catholic Church immediately after the council of Kiev decided Smotrytsky to be not fully devoted to the union, especially since it was still not publicly acknowledged that he had left Orthodoxy. In September 1629 Smotrytsky took part in Orthodox-Uniate Synod in Lviv, where he had already performed at the opening of the Uniate and Orthodox negotiations to convert to Catholicism. It was his last public appearance during which he took voice on issues of religion and the position of the Ruthenian nation. Synod of Lviv, in which assumptions and Uniate Metropolitan King was to lead to the establishment of the Republic of the Uniate Patriarchate, ended in the complete failure, because neither the Orthodox hierarchy, and even sent a fraternity Lvov agreed with their delegates. Archbishop of Hierapolis Smotrytsky could not remain archbishop of Polotsk, as the cathedral was already planted the Uniate Church. Josyf Velamyn Rutsky even suggested granting him the title of Bishop of Halych. Finally, on June 5, 1631, Pope Urban VIII gave him the title of (titular) Archbishop of Hierapolis. Thus, the former Orthodox archbishop of Polotsk had dignity in the Catholic Church, which did not give any real powers. The reason for such a decision was that the pope could have a negative assessment of Smotrytsky's attitudes at council in Kiev, where he pleaded not guilty to his conversion. Still in 1631 Smotrytsky wrote to Rome that he would like to be bishop of a Diocese of actually running in Ruthenia. At the same time he refused to travel as a missionary to Athos, where, he said, his work would not have prospects of success. Uniate clergy in letters to Rome consistently asserted that Smotrytsky eagerly engaged in the life of the Church. A multitude of these letters suggest, however, that for the rest of his life he remained under close supervision of the Uniate hierarchy. Smotrytsky still received letters from the brotherhood of Vilnius and from some Orthodox monks. In his letters, he appealed to the Orthodox to accept the union, as long as they were still society composed not only of peasants. In this way, they would retain certain rights and privileges. In the last four years of his life Smotrytsky did no theological work and never took the public to speak on matters connected with the Church. On February 16, 1630 Smotrytsky addressed to Pope Urban VIII, another letter in which he presented a new plan for the evolution of the Commonwealth, in which he suggested the use of force to spread the union by uniting the efforts of the Church, the State and the Catholic magnates. Smotrytsky's ever-increasing intolerance resulted from his conviction that only by adopt the union Ruthenians would become a political nation, respected on par with Poles and Lithuanians and preserving their autonomy. He was also convinced that attachment to the Ruthenian Catholic Church could bring a moral renewal of the Orthodox Church, as the former enjoyed the greatest freedom and had the best educated clergy. Meletius Smotrytsky died on December 27, 1633. His last confessor, Jesuit Wojciech Kortycki, dedicated to his memory eulogy he delivered then print. Metropolitan Joseph Welamin Rutski claimed Smotrycki was poisoned by the Orthodox deacon, which hired a scribe. He was buried in the monastery in Derman, which remained his residence from 1627. Canonization discussion During Josaphat Kuntsevych's beatification in 1637, Meletius Smotrytsky's beatification was also discussed because he was a persecutor of the union but changed his position to an ardent defender. Perhaps in order to popularize his candidacy for sainthood, in 1666 James Drought published a biography. The priest was after 1648 in Rome and where it could persuade the relevant authorities to consider the Smotrytsky beatification. Descriptions of supernatural events that took place after the death of Smotrytsky were given by his last confessor. According to his account he was dying to ask you to insert his hand in the coffin of Pope Urban VIII letter informing him of the receipt for the Archbishop of Hierapolis. Uniate monks but forgot about it the first time, and put a letter in the coffin just a few hours after the death of the priest. Then the hand of the deceased had to move and firmly grasp the document. His removal from the hand of the deceased was supposed to be possible only when he stood over the body, Metropolitan of Kiev and demanded the return of the letter. In a later version of the description of the event Kortycki put the information allegedly monks put in the coffin of the letter Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem, but this was completely ignored. Kortycki also asserted that before the funeral of a hand holding a letter miraculously renewed, giving the impression of living. Metropolitan Rutski confirmed that the following events actually took place, and even wrote about them for the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith in August 1634. On December 19, 1634 this congregation held a meeting during which it was decided that Smotrycki was murdered, and should be canonized as a martyr. The matter was discussed again in July 1635, and in October of the same year, a representative of the Congregation speaking to Rutsky to ask for a copy of the description posthumous miracle. In 1635 a Basilian monk named Isaiah, who was also a participant in the Smotrytsky's funeral, said the Onoratio Visconti, papal nuncio in Warsaw, that the deceased bishop kept in a coffin two lists - the papal and patriarchal. While the ultimate message of the Congregation stated that Smotrycki finally \\"rejected\\" letter of Patriarch theophany, doubts in this regard could be one of the reasons why the canonization process Smotryckiego was suspended. Grammar Smotrytsky is best known for his \\"Slavonic Grammar with Correct Syntax\\" (–ì—Ä–∞–º–º–∞—Ç—ñ–∫–∏ —Å–ª–∞–≤—î–Ω—Å–∫–∏—è –ø—Ä–∞–≤–∏–ª–Ω–æ—î –°v–Ω—Ç–∞“ë–º–∞, 1619), which codified what is now known as \\"Modern Church Slavonic\\" or, more specifically, \\"Meletian Church Slavonic\\". It was the sole handbook for grammar in Belarusian, Russian and Ukrainian lands, and had an enormous impact on the development of these languages. Smotrytsky's work also contributed greatly to the study of Church Slavonic texts throughout Eastern Europe. The 1619 grammar was first reprinted in 1721 and many times over later on. Smotrytsky's work for Slavic grammar can be compared by its impact with that of Dionysius Thrax for Greek and that of Aelius Donatus and Priscian for Latin.

Astronomy In astronomy, collisional excitation gives rise to spectral lines in the spectra of astronomical objects such as planetary nebulae and H II regions. In these objects, most atoms are ionised by photons from hot stars embedded within the nebular gas, stripping away electrons. The emitted electrons, (called photoelectrons), may collide with atoms or ions within the gas, and excite them. When these excited atoms or ions revert to their ground state, they will emit a photon. The spectral lines formed by these photons are called collisionally excited lines (often abbreviated to CELs). CELs are only seen in gases at very low densities (typically less than a few thousand particles per cm¬≥) for forbidden transitions. For allowed transitions, the gas density can be substantially higher. At higher densities, the reverse process of collisional de-excitation suppresses the lines. Even the hardest vacuum produced on earth is still too dense for CELs to be observed. For this reason, when CELs were first observed by William Huggins in the spectrum of the Cat's Eye Nebula, he did not know what they were, and attributed them to a hypothetical new element called nebulium. However, the lines he observed were later found to be emitted by extremely rarefied oxygen. CELs are very important in the study of gaseous nebulae, because they can be used to determine the density and temperature of the gas. Mass spectrometry Collisional excitation in mass spectrometry is the process where an ion collides with an atom or molecule and leads to an increase in the internal energy of the ion. Molecular ions are accelerated to high kinetic energy and then collide with neutral gas molecules (e.g. helium, nitrogen or argon). In the collision some of the kinetic energy is converted into internal energy which results in fragmentation in a process known as collision-induced dissociation.

He is the President of Sense & Sense International, Jewish Care, Barnet & Southgate Colleges, Jewish Free School (JFS) and Jewish Lads' and Girls' Brigade (JLGB) and he was previously President of Volunteering Matters. Levy was the chief fundraiser for the UK Labour Party. A long-standing friend of former Prime Minister, Tony Blair, Lord Levy spent nine years as Tony Blair's special envoy to the Middle East, being replaced by Gordon Brown's appointee, Lord Williams of Baglan, from September 2007. Early life Born in Stoke Newington, North London, to devout Jewish immigrant parents of modest means, Levy was educated at Grocers, later known as Hackney Downs School. Music career Levy qualified as a Chartered Accountant in 1966 (ACA then FCA) and set up a professional accountancy practice. The practice attracted a great number of clients in the music and entertainment industry and Levy became a specialist in international copyright and licence. Amongst the clients were the Foundations, Vanity Fair, Roger Greenaway, Barry Mason and many other successful producers and artists. Levy founded Magnet Records with Peter Shelley in 1973.Adam Sweeting \\"Alvin Stardust obituary\\", The Guardian, 23 October 2014 This became one of the most successful independent labels of its day and at one stage had 10% of the British singles market with four singles in the top ten. The successful artists on the label included Adrian Baker, Alvin Stardust, Chris Rea, Bad Manners, Darts, Susan Cadogan, Silver Convention and Guys 'n' Dolls. Levy sold Magnet Records to Warner Brothers in 1988 for ¬£10m. Guitarist Chris Rea said of Levy, \\"He is extremely tough, one of the hardest bastards I have ever met, but I would leave my children with him rather than anyone else.\\" The music producer Pete Waterman described him as \\"the greatest salesman I have ever met. He would be able to sell sand to the Arabs.\\" After Magnet was sold, Levy set up M&G; Records with backing from Polygram. M&G; Records was so named as it was the initials of Michael and his wife Gilda, and featured acts such as Zoe who had a top five hit with \\"Sunshine on a Rainy Day\\" and Pele who had success with \\"Fair blows the wind for France\\". Polygram were then bought out and the company was eventually sold to Bertelsmann (BMG) in 1997. Aptitude for fundraising Levy was involved in fundraising from his early life and from the late 1960s for many causes including Jewish and Israeli causes. For this he showed a special adeptness, raising, between 1988‚Äì1994, ¬£60m for Jewish Care, an amalgam of several Jewish charitable organisations, of which he is now President. Simon Morris, Former Chief Executive of Jewish Care, said of Levy that, when it comes to fundraising, \\"there's no one better in the country.\\" Levy has been described as the number one fundraiser in the country, and he has raised hundreds of millions of pounds for charitable causes over the years. Political life Levy first met Tony Blair at a dinner party in 1994, hosted by Israeli diplomat Gideon Meir, the two having a common friend in Eldred Tabachnik, a senior barrister (now a QC and a former president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews) at 11 King's Bench Walk, the chambers founded by Derry Irvine where Blair had trained in the early 1980s. They soon became close friends and tennis partners. Levy ran the Labour Leader's Office Fund to finance Blair's campaign before the 1997 general election and received substantial contributions from such figures as Alex Bernstein and Robert Gavron, both of whom were ennobled by Blair after he came to power. Levy himself was created a life peer on 23 September 1997 as Baron Levy, of Mill Hill in the London Borough of Barnet. Since making his maiden speech on 3 December 1997, Levy has not spoken in a debate at the House of Lords. He has been described by The Jerusalem Post as \\"undoubtedly the notional leader of British Jewry\\". He was a founding member of the Jewish Leadership Council, the leadership of UK Jewish community. Levy has close ties with Israeli political leaders. His son, Daniel Levy, was active in Israeli political life, and has served as an assistant to the former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and to former Knesset member Yossi Beilin. His son Daniel is now based in the UK and is now President of the US Middle East Project and before that was Head of the Middle East Department of the European Council of Foreign Relations. Levy has praised Blair for his \\"solid and committed support of the State of Israel\\"Jewish Care, Fundraising Dinner 2006 and \\"his commitment to the peace process\\". Levy was associated with the Labour Friends of Israel. Known as \\"Lord Cashpoint\\" to some in the media and politics, he was the leading fundraiser for the Labour Party from 1994 to 2007 (having raised over ¬£100m for the Labour Party). In 2007 he voluntarily decided to step down at the same time as former Prime Minister Tony Blair. In 2000, Levy was criticised when it was revealed that he had paid only ¬£5,000 tax during the financial year 1998‚Äì1999 ‚Äì however it was subsequently shown even in that year the tax paid was ¬£30,000. In an interview at the time, repeated on BBC2's Newsnight on 16 March 2006, Levy stated that \\"Over the years I have paid many millions of tax and, if you average it, each year it comes to many hundreds of thousands of pounds. In that particular year, I was giving my time to the Labour Party and the voluntary sector, and I just lived off capital.\\" From 1998 until 2007, he acted as Prime Minister Blair's personal envoy to the Middle East. Many leaders in the region including Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas have praised Levy for always offering constructive suggestions. Mr Blair has said Lord Levy carried out \\"a perfectly excellent job as my envoy under very difficult circumstances\\". In September 2005, Levy was appointed President of the Council of the Specialist Schools and Academies Trust, the body overseeing the government's Specialist schools and Academy programmes. =Cash for honours= Levy was arrested and questioned in connection with the \\"Cash for Honours\\" inquiry by the Metropolitan Police on 12 July 2006 (whereby it was suggested that money was paid to political parties for Honours in particular peerages). No charges were made against Levy and the police removed all details from their files. Other positions Levy is President of Jewish Care, the Jewish Free School (JFS), Jewish Lads' and Girls' Brigade (JLGB), Barnet & Southgate Colleges and Sense & Sense International. and the Honorary President of UJIA and the former President of Volunteering Matters. He is a Member of the Advisory Council of Step Up to Serve Campaign (2013- ). He is the Chair of the Policy Network Foundation, a policy think tank. He also holds and has held a number of other positions in the voluntary sector and he was a former member of the Board of Directors of the International Peace Institute, IPI (2014-2019). . In 2008 Levy became Chairman of International Standard Asset Management until 2011. Now Principal of Global Consultancy Services acting as a Consultant to a number of companies. Personal life He and his wife Gilda have a son, Daniel, and a daughter, Juliet. Levy's home in Totteridge, North London, was burgled in 2003. He and his wife Gilda were restrained with handcuffs and had bleach poured over them. Levy was hit on the head with a shovel and had his wrist broken; the attackers fled with ¬£80,000 of cash and jewellery. Lord Levy received an Honorary Doctorate from Middlesex University in 1999, and the Israel Policy Forum (USA) Special Recognition Award in 2003. In 1994 he was a Recipient of the B'nai B'rith First Lodge Award and in 1998 a Recipient of the Friends of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem Scopus Award.

This can lead to tissue ischemia and tissue death (necrosis). Cerebral vasospasm may arise in the context of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Symptomatic vasospasm or delayed cerebral ischemia is a major contributor to post-operative stroke and death especially after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Vasospasm typically appears 4 to 10 days after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Along with physical resistance, vasospasm is a main cause of ischemia. Like physical resistance, vasospasms can occur due to atherosclerosis. Vasospasm is the major cause of Prinzmetal's angina. Pathophysiology Normally endothelial cells release prostacyclin and nitric oxide (NO) which induce relaxation of the smooth muscle cells, and reduce aggregation of platelets. Aggregating platelets stimulate ADP to act on endothelial cells and help them induce relaxation of the smooth muscle cells. However, aggregating platelets also stimulate thromboxane A2 and serotonin which can induce contraction of the smooth muscle cells. In general, the relaxations outweighs the contractions. In atherosclerosis, a dysfunctional endothelium is observed on examination. It does not stimulate as much prostacyclin and NO to induce relaxation on smooth muscle cells. Also there is not as much inhibition of aggregation of platelets. In this case, the greater aggregation of platelets produce ADP, serotonin, and thromboxane A2. However the serotonin and the thromboxane A2 cause more contraction of the smooth muscle cells and as a result contractions outweigh the relaxations. Complications Ischemia in the heart due to prolonged coronary vasospasm can lead to angina, myocardial infarction and even death. Vasospasm in the hands and fingers due to prolonged exposure to vibration (30 - 300 MHz) and triggered by cold can lead to Hand-arm vibration syndrome in which feeling and manual dexterity are lost. Treatment The occurrence of vasospasm can be reduced by preventing the occurrence of atherosclerosis. This can be done in several ways, the most important being lifestyle modifications‚Äîdecreasing low- density lipoprotein (LDL), quitting smoking, physical activity, and control for other risk factors including diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. Pharmacological therapies include hypolipidemic agents, thrombolytics and anticoagulants. Pharmacological options for reducing the severity and occurrence of ischemic episodes include the organic nitrates classified as having long acting (i.e. isosorbide dinitrate) and short acting (i.e. nitroglycerin) durations of action. These drugs work by increasing nitric oxide levels in the blood and inducing coronary vasodilation which will allow for more coronary blood flow due to a decreased coronary resistance, allowing for increased oxygen supply to the vital organs (myocardium). The nitric oxide increase in the blood resulting from these drugs also causes dilation of systemic veins which in turn causes a reduction in venous return, ventricular work load and ventricular radius. All of these reductions contribute to the decrease in ventricular wall stress which is significant because this causes the demand of oxygen to decrease. In general organic nitrates decrease oxygen demand and increase oxygen supply. It is this favourable change to the body that can decrease the severity of ischemic symptoms, particularly angina. Other medications used to reduce the occurrence and severity of vasospasm and ultimately ischemia include L-type calcium channel blockers (notably nimodipine, as well as verapamil, diltiazem, nifedipine) and beta-receptor antagonists (more commonly known as beta blockers or Œ≤-blockers) such as propranolol. L-type calcium channel blockers can induce dilation of the coronary arteries while also decreasing the heart's demand for oxygen by reducing contractility, heart rate, and wall stress. The reduction of these latter three factors decreases the contractile force that the myocardium must exert in order to achieve the same level of cardiac output. Beta-receptor antagonists do not cause vasodilation, but like L-type calcium channel blockers, they do reduce the heart's demand for oxygen. This reduction similarly results from a decrease in heart rate, afterload, and wall stress. =Adverse effects= Like most pharmacological therapeutic options, there are risks that should be considered. For these drugs in particular, vasodilation can be associated with some adverse effects which might include orthostatic hypotension, reflex tachycardia, headaches and palpitations. Tolerance may also develop over time due compensatory response of the body, as well as depletion of -SH groups of glutathione which are essential for the metabolism of the drugs to their active forms. Potential side effects: *Verapamil: hypotension, bradycardia, constipation *Diltiazem: hypotension, bradycardia, risk of heart block *Nifedipine: hypotension *Propranolol: asystole, asthma attacks =Contraindications= Organic nitrates should not be taken with PDE5 inhibitors (i.e. sildenafil) since both NO and PDE5 inhibitors increase cyclic GMP levels and the sum of their pharmacodynamic effects will greatly exceed the optimal therapeutic levels. What you could see upon taking both medications at the same time, as caused by the much higher induction of relaxation of smooth muscle cells, include a severe drop in blood pressure. Beta-receptor antagonists should be avoided in patients with reactive pulmonary disease to avoid asthma attacks. Also Beta-receptor antagonists should be avoided in patients with AV node dysfunction and/or patients on other medications which might cause bradycardia (i.e. calcium channel blockers). The potential for these contraindications and drug-drug interaction could lead to asystole and cardiac arrest. Certain calcium channel blocker should be avoided with some beta-receptor blockers since they may cause severe bradycardia and other potential side effects. =Corrective therapy= Since vasospasms can be caused by atherosclerosis and contribute to the severity of ischemia there are some surgical options which can restore circulation to these ischemic areas. Regarding coronary vasospasm, one surgical intervention, referred to as percutaneous coronary intervention or angioplasty, involves placing a stent at the site of stenosis in an artery and inflating the stent using a balloon catheter. Another surgical intervention is coronary artery bypass.

The term carries the connotation that German Jews are notable for attention to detail and punctuality.  Etymology  There are a number of theories regarding the etymology of the word. The best known is that it originates from the cultural differences in dress that developed between the more westernized Western European Jews who wore shorter \\"jackets\\" (\\"yekke\\", cf. German Jacke with an initial y-sound instead of the English j-sound) from the traditional longer coats while the outer clothing worn by the Eastern European Jews was typically longer. Another theory is that the word derives from \\"Yekkef\\", the Western European pronunciation of the name \\"Jacob\\" or \\"James\\", which differs from the Eastern European pronunciation, \\"Yankef\\" or \\"Yankev\\" (also see German J√§ckel, pronounced \\"yekkel\\", the German diminutive form of Jakob). Furthermore, since Yiddish is derived from Middle High German, German sources occasionally note that Yiddish yekk(e) is largely homophone with jeck(e), the Rhenish dialectal form of Standard German Geck of uncertain origin but in contexts relating German jeck(e) to Yiddish yekk(e) attributed to patriarch Jacob in the Bible as does above-mentioned Yekkef theory. Rhenish Jeck(e) as a noun denotes a \\"fool\\", \\"jester\\", or \\"crazy person\\" (both in a general sense, and in particular in association with the Rhenish carnival where the term describes a traditional folkloric stage figure akin to the Italian harlequin as well as merely a reveler celebrating the carnival season in a \\"foolish\\" manner due to ebriety) and as an adjective means \\"crazy\\", \\"mad\\", \\"insane\\", whereas the dated High German word Geck originally meant a \\"fool\\" as well but later transformed to particularly signify a \\"dandy\\" or \\"fop\\". However, the broader usage of the Rhenish noun Jeck(e) in the Rhineland area has given the term a general meaning resembling \\"person\\", \\"(mere) mortal\\", or \\"humble sinner\\" with a particularly (self-)ironic connotation, such as in the common saying Jeder Jeck is anders (lit. \\"Every fool is different\\", with an idiomatic meaning of \\"Different strokes for different folks\\" or \\"Live and let live\\"). From there, a transformation into an ethnonym such as for Jewish people would be akin to the fate of similar terms such as Germanic man (word) and *√æiuda-, and the equivalent words for \\"person\\" or \\"human being\\" in many other languages around the world.  Usage  The term is often used in a slightly derogatory or cynical manner, although it is also used as a compliment. It is used mainly in reference to the German Jews‚Äô legendary attention to detail and punctuality. This sense for detail extends into the strict adherence to minhagim (religious customs, especially when pertaining to the synagogue service). Oberlanders ‚Äî Jews originating from the northwestern part of the former Kingdom of Hungary ‚Äî are often confused with yekkes due to similar minhagim. Demography The wave of immigration to British Mandated Palestine in the 1930s and 1940s known as the Fifth Aliyah was composed predominantly of Yekkes. Many of them settled in the vicinity of Ben Yehuda Street in Tel Aviv, leading to the nickname \\"Ben Yehuda Strasse.\\" Their struggle to master Hebrew produced a dialect known as \\"Yekkish.\\" The Ben Yehuda Strasse Dictionary: A Dictionary of Spoken Yekkish in the Land of Israel, published in 2012, documents this language. Yekke minhag Today, because of the Holocaust, very few original Yekkes are still German residents, but they remain in regions such as Switzerland, Eastern France (Alsace and Lorraine), Netherlands and Luxembourg. A significant community escaped Frankfurt after Kristallnacht, and relocated to the Washington Heights region of New York City, where they still have a synagogue, K'hal Adass Jeshurun, which punctiliously adheres to the Yekkish liturgical text, rituals, and melodies. A group of Yekkes established kibbutz Chofetz Chaim in the Gedarim region of Israel just south of Tel Aviv. Recently a few new Yekkish communities have been started in Israel by \\"Machon Moreshet Ashkenaz,\\" and one of the leading communities is K'hal Adas Yeshurun of Jerusalem, which is running a \\"Nusach Project\\", a project of preserving the special Yekkish melodies. The short film Chaja & Mimi focuses on the ambivalent relationship of two Yekkish Israeli women to the city of their birth, Berlin.

She sat on a number of enquiry commissions, including one into the death of 'Biscuit Baron' Rajan Pillai, and was also a part of the three- member bench of the Justice Verma Committee that was established to overhaul India's rape laws in the aftermath of the infamous 2012 Delhi gang-rape case. She was a member of the 15th Law Commission of India from 1997 to 2000, and was responsible for the amendments to the Hindu Succession Act that gave equal rights to daughters in joint family property. Early life Leila Seth was born on 20 October 1930 in Lucknow, the first daughter after two sons in her family. She is said to have been very close to her father, who worked in the Imperial Railway Service and was devastated when he died when she was only 11 years old. After her father's death, the family struggled financially, but Leila's mother managed to educate her in Loreto Convent, Darjeeling. After finishing her schooling, she began to work as a stenographer in Kolkata. It was here that she was introduced to her husband Prem Seth, and had what she called a 'semi-arranged' marriage. After marriage, she moved to London with her husband who was working at Bata. Her move to London gave her the opportunity to start studying law. In an interview, she said that she picked law for the simple reason that it did not require attending classes, which was a priority since she had an infant at the time. In 1958, Leila Seth wrote the London Bar exam and topped it at the age of 27, becoming the first woman to do so. She joined the bar in 1959. In the same year she also cleared the civil services examination as an IAS officer. Upon topping the Bar in England, Seth was referred to as \\"Mother-in-Law\\" by a London newspaper, which carried a photograph of a young Leila Seth with her infant son, born only a few months before the exams. At the same time, other newspapers expressed their grief about how out of 580 students who took the Bar Exam, a married woman topped it.  Career  Immediately after the London Bar, Leila and Prem Seth moved back to India, where Leila began to practice law in Patna. She initially worked under a senior lawyer named Sachin Chaudhary. She also worked as a junior to Ashoke Kumar Sen. She worked at the Patna High Court for 10 years. She has spoken about the discriminatory attitudes she had to face for being a woman in the male-dominated field of law. She recounted how she would initially not get a lot of work, as people did not think a woman lawyer would be capable of handling it. Leila Seth handled diverse cases, from Tax matters (Income Tax, Sales Tax, Excise and Customs), to Company Law, Constitutional Law, Civil, Criminal cases and also Matrimonial suits and public interest litigations. After practicing at the Patna High Court for 10 years, Leila Seth moved to the Delhi High Court in 1972 and worked with original civil petitions, criminal matters, company petitions, revisions and appeals. In the same year, she launched her Supreme Court practice, handling tax matters, writ petitions and constitutional civil and criminal appeals. She was also on the panel of lawyers for the West Bengal government in the Supreme Court from June 1974. On 10 January 1977, she was designated as a senior advocate by the Supreme Court. In 1978, Leila Seth became a Judge of the Delhi High Court, breaking the glass ceiling by becoming the first woman to do so. Her career continued to rise as she became the Chief Justice of Himachal Pradesh High Court, again the first woman to be the Chief Justice of a State High Court. Leila Seth chaired various judicial and humanitarian institutions. She was a member of the 15th Law Commission of India from 1997 to 2000, during which time she spearheaded the campaign to give daughters inheritance rights over ancestral property in the Hindu Succession Act (1956). She was also served as the Chair of the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI) for several years. Justice Seth was also a part of various enquiry commissions, one of which was responsible for studying the effects of the television serial, Shaktiman (about a popular superhero) on children. Shaktiman was a popular TV series for children and it was the center of controversy because many children set themselves on fire or threw themselves off buildings hoping that Shaktiman would come and rescue them. She was also the single-member of the Justice Leila Seth Commission which enquired into the custodial death of businessman Rajan Pillai, or popularly known as \\"Biscuit Baron\\". Significantly, Justice Seth was a part of the three member Justice Verma Commission instituted after the 2012 Delhi gang rape case to look into an overhaul of rape laws in India.  Family  Justice Leila Seth married Prem Seth when she was 20 years old. They had three children together ‚Äì Vikram Seth, Shantum Seth and Aradhana Seth. Vikram Seth went on to be an acclaimed poet and author, Shantum Seth is a Buddhist teacher, and Aradhana is a filmmaker. Leila Seth was vocal about supporting her son Vikram Seth when he came out as gay, and wrote extensively decrying Section 377 and in favour of LGBTQIA rights, including an op-ed in The Times Of India after the Koushal judgment in 2013 reinstated Section 377.  Death  Justice Leila Seth died after suffering a cardio-respiratory attack on the night of 5 May 2017 at her residence in Noida, aged 86. She is survived by her husband, two sons and a daughter. As per her wishes no funeral was held since she donated her eyes and other organs for transplant or medical research purposes.Leila Seth, first woman judge of Delhi high court, dies at 86Justice Leila Seth, First Woman Judge Of Delhi High Court, Dies At 86 Further reading *Seth, Leila.

This subfamily includes the largest shrew, the Asian house shrew (Suncus murinus), at about 15 cm in length, and the smallest, the Etruscan shrew (Suncus etruscus), at about 3.5 cm in length and 2 grams in weight. Shrews are possibly the world's smallest extant mammal (although some give this title to the bumblebee bat). Crocidura contains the most species of any mammal genus. When young must be moved before they are independent, mother and young form a chain or \\"caravan\\" where each animal hangs on to the rear of the one in front.

Datu is a title which denotes the rulers (variously described in historical accounts as chiefs, sovereign princes, and monarchs of numerous indigenous peoples throughout the Philippine archipelago. The title is still used today, especially in Mindanao, Sulu and Palawan, but it was used much more extensively in early Philippine history, particularly in the regions of Central and Southern Luzon, the Visayas and Mindanao. Overview In early Philippine history, Datus and a small group of their close relatives formed the \\"apex stratum\\" of the traditional three-tier social hierarchy of lowland Philippine societies. Only a member of this birthright aristocracy (called \\"maginoo\\", \\"nobleza\\", \\"maharlika\\", or \\"timagua\\" by various early chroniclers) could become a Datu; members of this elite could hope to become a datu by demonstrating prowess in war and/or exceptional leadership. In large coastal polities such as those in Maynila, Tondo, Pangasinan, Cebu, Panay, Bohol, Butuan, Cotabato, Lanao, and Sulu, several datus brought their loyalty-groups, referred to as \\"barangays\\" or \\"dulohan\\", into compact settlements which allowed greater degrees of cooperation and economic specialization. In such cases, datus of these barangays would then select the most senior or most respected among them to serve as what scholars call a \\"paramount leader, or \\"paramount datu.\\" The titles used by such paramount datu changed from case to case, but some of the most prominent examples were: Sultan in the most Islamized areas of Mindanao; Lakan among the Tagalog people; Thimuay among the Subanen people; Rajah in polities which traded extensively with Indonesia and Malaysia; or simply Datu in some areas of Mindanao and the Visayas. Proofs of Filipino royalty and nobility (Dug√≥ng Bugh√°w) can be demonstrated only by clear blood descent from ancient native royal blood,Cf. Vicente de Cadenas y Vicent, \\"Las Pruebas de Nobleza y Genealogia en Filipinas y Los Archivios en Donde se Pueden Encontrar Antecedentes de Ellas\\" in \\"Heraldica, Genealogia y Nobleza en los Editoriales de ¬´Hidalguia¬ª\\", Madrid: 1993, Graficas Ari√°s Montano, S.A.-MONTOLES, pp. 232‚Äì235.By the end of the 16th century, any claim to Filipino royalty, nobility, or hidalgu√≠a had disappeared into a homogenized, hispanized, and Christianized nobility ‚Äì the Principal√≠a. Cf. William Henry Scott, Cracks in the Parchment Curtain, Quezon City: 1998, pp. 117‚Äì118. Cf. Also this article's section on Datu during the Spanish Regime and also the section on Prohibition of New Royal and Noble Titles in the Philippine Constitution. and in some cases adoption into a royal family.  Terminology  Datu (Baybayin: ), is the title for chiefs, sovereign princes, and monarchs throughout the Philippine archipelago.For more information about the social system of the Indigenous Philippine society before the Spanish colonization see Barangay in Enciclopedia Universal Ilustrada Europea-Americana, Madrid: Espasa-Calpe, S.

Sin embargo, esas sociedades primitivas, independientes totalmente las unas de las otras, estaban en cierta manera estructuradas y se apreciaba en ellas una organizaci√≥n jer√°rquica embrionaria y local, pero era digna de ser atendida. Precisamente en esa organizaci√≥n local es, como siempre, de donde nace la nobleza. El indio aborigen, jefe de tribu, es reconocido como noble y las pruebas irrefutables de su nobleza se encuentran principalmente en las Hojas de Servicios de los militares de origen filipino que abrazaron la carrera de las Armas, cuando para hacerlo necesariamente era preciso demostrar el origen nobiliario del individuo. (On the other hand, while in the Indies pre-Columbian culture had reached a high level, in the Philippines the island civilization continued to manifest itself in its most primitive states. However, these primitive societies, totally independent of each other, were in some way structured and had an embryonic and local hierarchical organization in them, but it was worthy of being attended to. Precisely in that local organization is, as always, where the nobility is born. The Aboriginal Indian, chief of tribe, is recognized as noble and the irrefutable proofs of his nobility are found mainly in the Service Records of militarymen of the Filipino origin who embraced military career, when in order to do so it was necessary to prove the noble lineage of the individual.) de Caidenas y Vicent, Vicente, Las Pruebas de Nobleza y Genealogia en Filipinas y Los Archivios en Donde se Pueden Encontrar Antecedentes de Ellas in Heraldica, Genealogia y Nobleza en los Editoriales de Hidalguia, (1953‚Äì1993: 40 a√±os de un pensamiento).

Depending upon the prestige of the sovereign royal family, the title of Datu could be equated to Royal Princes, European dukes, marquesses and counts.\\"There were no kings or lords throughout these islands who ruled over them as in the manner of our kingdoms and provinces; but in every island, and in each province of it, many chiefs were recognized by the natives themselves. Some were more powerful than others, and each one had his followers and subjects, by districts and families; and these obeyed and respected the chief. Some chiefs had friendship and communication with others, and at times wars and quarrels. These principalities and lordships were inherited in the male line and by succession of father and son and their descendants. If these were lacking, then their brothers and collateral relatives succeeded... When any of these chiefs was more courageous than others in war and upon other occasions, such a one enjoyed more followers and men; and the others were under his leadership, even if they were chiefs. These latter retained to themselves the lordship and particular government of their own following, which is called barangay among them. They had datos and other special leaders [mandadores] who attended to the interests of the barangay.\\" Antonio de Morga, The Project Gutenberg EBook of History of the Philippine Islands, Vols. 1 and 2, Chapter VIII. In large ancient barangays, which had contacts with other southeast Asian cultures through trade, some Datus took the title Rajah or Sultan.Examples of Datus who took the title Rajah were Rajah Soliman, Rajah Matanda, and Rajah Humabon. Cf. Landa Jocano, Filipino Prehistory, Manila: 2001, p.160. The oldest historical records mentioning the title datu are the 7th century Srivijayan inscriptions such as Telaga Batu to describe lesser kings or vassalized kings.Casparis, J.G., (1956), Prasasti Indonesia II: Selected Inscriptions from the 7th to the 9th Century A.D., Dinas Purbakala Republik Indonesia, Bandung: Masa Baru. The word datu is a cognate of the Malay terms Dato or Datuk and to the Fijian chiefly title of Ratu. Indigenous concepts, models and terminology concerning nobility and rulership among the peoples of the Philippine archipelago differed from one culture to the other, but lowland communities typically had a three-tier social structure aristocracy. In many of these societies, the word \\"Datu\\" meant the ruler of a particular social group, known as a Barangay, Dulohan, or Kedatuan.  History  In pre-Islamic times, the political leadership office was vested in a Rajaship in Manila and a Datuship elsewhere in the Philippines. =Datu in Moro and Lumad societies in Mindanao= In the later part of the 1500s, the Spaniards took possession of most of Luzon and the Visayas, converting the lowland population to Christianity from their local indigenous religion. But although Spain eventually established footholds in northern and eastern Mindanao and the Zamboanga Peninsula, its armies failed to colonise the rest of Mindanao. This area was populated by Islamised peoples (\\"Moros\\" to the Spaniards) and by many non-Muslim indigenous groups now known as Lumad peoples.Mindanao Land of Promise (archived from the original on October 28, 2008) The Moro societies of Mindanao and Sulu Sultan Jamalul Kiram II of Sulu with William Howard Taft (1901) In the traditional structure of Moro societies, the sultans were the highest authority followed by the datus or rajah, with their rule being sanctioned by the Quran. The titles Datu and Rajah however, predates the coming of Islam. These titles were assimilated into the new structure under Islam. Datus were supported by their tribes. In return for tribute and labor, the datu provided aid in emergencies and advocacy in disputes with other communities and warfare through the Agama and Maratabat laws. The Lumad societies of Mindanao Bagobo matanum (chieftain) who leads communities along with elders (magani) and female shamans (mabalian) At the beginning of the 20th century, the Lumad peoples controlled an area that now covers 17 of Mindanao's 24 provinces‚Äîbut by the 1980 census they constituted less than 6% of the population of Mindanao and Sulu. Heavy migration to Mindanao of Visayans, who have been settling in the Island for centuries, spurred by government-sponsored resettlement programmes, turned the Lumads into minorities. The Bukidnon province population grew from 63,470 in 1948 to 194,368 in 1960 and 414,762 in 1970, with the proportion of indigenous Bukidnons falling from 64% to 33% to 14%. There are 18 Lumad ethnolinguistic groups: Ata people, Bagobo, Banwaon, B‚Äôlaan, Bukidnon, Dibabawon, Higaonon, Mamanwa, Mandaya, Manguwangan, Manobo, Mansaka, Subanon, Tagakaolo, Tasaday, Tboli, Teduray and Ubo. Lumad datus have involved themselves in protecting their homeland forests from illegal loggers during the past decades. Some have joined the New People's Army (NPA), a communist rebel group in the Country, for the cause of their people. Others have resisted joining the Moro and Communist separatist movements. A datu is still basic to the smooth functioning of Lumad and Moro societies today. They have continued to act as the community leaders in their respective tribes among a variety of Indigenous peoples in Mindanao. Moros, Lumads and Visayans now share with new settlers a homeland in Mindanao.Chieftains =Datu in pre- colonial principalities in the Visayas= Visayan kadatuan (royal) couple as depicted in the Boxer Codex of the 16th century. In more affluent and powerful territorial jurisdictions and principalities in Visayas, e.g., PanayHistorians classify four types of unhispanized societies in the Philippines, some of which still survive in remote and isolated parts of the Country: * Classless societies * Warrior societies, characterized by a distinct warrior class, in which membership is won by personal achievement, entails privilege, duty, and prescribed norms of conduct, and is requisite for community leadership * Petty plutocracies dominated socially and politically by a recognized class of rich men who attain membership through birthright, property, and by performing specified ceremonies. They are \\"petty\\" because their authority is localized, being extended by neither absentee landlordism nor territorial subjugation * Principalities: Scott's book mostly mentions examples in Mindanao, however, this form of society was predominant on the plains of the Visayan Islands and Luzon, during the pre-conquest era. Cf. William Henry Scott, Cracks in the Parchment Curtain, Quezon City: 1998, p. 139.Cf. William Henry Scott, Cracks in the Parchment Curtain, Quezon City: 1998, pp. 127‚Äì147.During the early part of the Spanish colonization of the Philippines the Spanish Augustinian Friar, Gaspar de San Agust√≠n, O.S.A., describes Iloilo and Panay as one of the most populated islands in the archipelago and the most fertile of all the islands of the Philippines. He also talks about Iloilo, particularly the ancient settlement of Halaur, as site of a progressive trading post and a court of illustrious nobilities. The friar says: Es la isla de Panay muy parecida a la de Sicilia, as√≠ por su forma triangular come por su fertilidad y abundancia de bastimentos... Es la isla m√°s poblada, despu√©s de Manila y Mindanao, y una de las mayores, por bojear m√°s de cien leguas. En fertilidad y abundancia es en todas la primera... El otro corre al oeste con el nombre de Alaguer [Halaur], desembocando en el mar a dos leguas de distancia de Dumangas...Es el pueblo muy hermoso, ameno y muy lleno de palmares de cocos. Antiguamente era el emporio y corte de la m√°s lucida nobleza de toda aquella isla...Mamuel Merino, O.S.A., ed., Conquistas de las Islas Filipinas (1565‚Äì1615), Madrid: Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, 1975, pp. 374‚Äì376. Cebu and Leyte The encomienda of 1604 shows that many coastal barangays in Panay, Leyte , Bohol and Cebu were flourishing trading centers. Some of these barangays had large populations. In Panay, some barangays had 20,000 inhabitants; in Leyte (Baybay) 15,000 inhabitants; and in Cebu, 3,500 residents. There were smaller barangays with fewer people. But these were generally inland communities; or if they were coastal, they were not located in areas good for business pursuits. Cf. F. Landa Jocano, Filipino Prehistory: Rediscovering Precolonial Heritage (1998), pp. 157‚Äì158, 164Leyte and Cebu, Pampanga, Pangasinan, Pasig, Laguna, and Cagayan River were flourishing trading centers. Some of these barangays had large populations. In Panay, some barangays had 20,000 inhabitants; in Leyte (Baybay), 15,000 inhabitants; in Cebu, 3,500 residents; in Vitis (Pampanga), 7,000 inhabitants; Pangsinan, 4,000 residents. There were smaller barangays with fewer people. But these were generally inland communities; or if they were coastal, they were not located in areas good for business pursuits. Cf. F. Landa Jocano, Filipino Prehistory: Rediscovering Precolonial Heritage (1998), pp. 157‚Äì158, 164(which were never conquered by Spain but were accomplished as vassals by means of pacts, peace treaties, and reciprocal alliances),Cf. William Henry Scott, Cracks in the Parchment Curtain, Quezon City: 1998, p. 4. Also cf. Antonio Morga, Sucessos de las Islas Filipinas, 2nd ed., Paris: 1890, p. xxxiii. the \\"Datu\\" Class was at the top of a divinely sanctioned and stable social order in a Sakop or Kinadatuan (Kadatuan in ancient Malay; Kedaton in Javanese; and Kedatuan in many parts of modern Southeast Asia), which is elsewhere commonly referred to also as barangay.The word \\"sakop\\" means \\"jurisdiction\\", and \\"Kinadatuan\\" refers to the realm of the Datu ‚Äì his principality. This social order was divided into three classes. The Kadatuan (members of the Visayan Datu Class) were compared by the Boxer Codex to the titled Lords (Se√±ores de titulo) in Spain.William Henry Scott, Cracks in the Parchment Curtain, Quezon City: 1998, pp. 102 and 112 As Agalon or Amo (Lords),In Panay, even at present, the landed descendants of the Principales are still referred to as Agalon or Amo by their tenants. However, the tenants are no longer called Oripon (in Karay-a, i.e., the Ilonggo sub- dialect) or Olipun (in Sin√¢, i.e., Ilonggo spoken in the lowlands and cities). Instead, the tenants are now commonly referred to as Tinawo (subjects) the Datus enjoyed an ascribed right to respect, obedience, and support from their \\"Oripun\\" (Commoner) or followers belonging to the Third Order. These Datus had acquired rights to the same advantages from their legal \\"Timawa\\" or vassals (Second Order), who bind themselves to the Datu as his seafaring warriors. \\"Timawas\\" paid no tribute, and rendered no agricultural labor. They had a portion of the Datu's blood in their veins. The above-mentioned Boxer Codex calls these \\"Timawas\\": Knights and Hidalgos. The Spanish conquistador, Miguel de Loarca, described them as \\"free men, neither chiefs nor slaves\\". In the late 1600s, the Spanish Jesuit priest Fr. Francisco Ignatio Alcina, classified them as the third rank of nobility (nobleza). To maintain purity of bloodline, Datus marry only among their kind, often seeking high ranking brides in other Barangays, abducting them, or contracting brideprices in gold, slaves and jewelry. Meanwhile, the Datus keep their marriageable daughters secluded for protection and prestige. Seclusion and Veiling of Women: A Historical and Cultural Approach These well-guarded and protected highborn women were called \\"Binokot\\",Cf. Emma Helen Blair and James Alexander Robertson, The Philippine Islands (1493‚Äì1898), Cleveland: The A.H. Clark Company, 1903, Vol. XXIX, pp. 290‚Äì291. the Datus of pure descent (four generations) were called \\"Potli nga Datu\\" or \\"Lubus nga Datu\\",William Henry Scott, Cracks in the Parchment Curtain, Quezon City: 1998, p. 113. while a woman of noble lineage (especially the elderly) are addressed by the inhabitants of Panay as \\"Uray\\" (meaning: pure as gold), e.g., Uray Hilway.Cf. Emma Helen Blair and James Alexander Robertson, The Philippine Islands (1493‚Äì1898), Cleveland: The A.H. Clark Company, 1903, Vol. XXIX, p. 292. =Datu in pre-colonial principalities in the Tagalog region= Tagalog royal couple in red, the distinctive colour of their class. The different type of culture prevalent in Luzon gave a less stable and more complex social structure to the pre-colonial Tagalog barangays of Manila, Pampanga and Laguna. Enjoying a more extensive commerce than those in Visayas, having the influence of Bornean political contacts, and engaging in farming wet rice for a living, the Tagalogs were described by the Spanish Augustinian Friar Martin de Rada as more traders than warriors.Cf. William Henry Scott, Cracks in the Parchment Curtain, Quezon City: 1998, pp. 124‚Äì125. The more complex social structure of the Tagalogs was less stable during the arrival of the Spaniards because it was still in a process of differentiating. In this society, the term Datu or Lakan, or Apo refers to the chief, but the noble class (to which the Datu belonged, or could come from) was the Maginoo Class. One could be born a Maginoo, but could become a 'Datu by personal achievement.Cf. William Henry Scott, Cracks in the Parchment Curtain, Quezon City: 1998, p. 125. =Datu during the Spanish period= The Datu Class (First Estate) of the four echelons of Filipino Society at the time of contact with the Europeans (as described by Fr. Juan de Plasencia- a pioneer Franciscan missionary in the Philippines), was referred to by the Spaniards as the Principal√≠a. Loarca,Cf. Emma Helen Blair and James Alexander Robertson, The Philippine Islands (1493‚Äì1898), Cleveland: The A.H. Clark Company, 1903, Vol. V, p. 155. and the Canon Lawyer Antonio de Morga, who classified the Society into three estates (ruler, ruled, slave), also affirmed the usage of this term and also spoke about the preeminence of the Principales.Cf. William Henry Scott, Cracks in the Parchment Curtain, Quezon City: 1998, p. 99. All members of this Datu class were Principales,Tous les descendants de ces chefs √©taient regard√©s comme nobles et exempts des corv√©es et autres services auxquels √©taient assujettis les roturiers que l on appelait \\"timaguas\\". Les femmes √©taient nobles comme les hommes.J. Mallat, Les Philippines, histoire, geographie, moeurs, agriculture, industrie et commerce des Colonies espagnoles dans l'oceanie, Paris: 1846, p. 53. whether they ruled or not.The Real Academia Espa≈àola defines Principal as a \\"person or thing that holds first place in value or importance, and is given precedence and preference before others\\". This Spanish term best describes the Datu class of the society in the Archipelago, which the Europeans came in contact with. Cf. William Henry Scott, Cracks in the Parchment Curtain, Quezon City: 1998, p. 99. San Buenaventura's 1613 Dictionary of the Tagalog Language defines three terms that clarify the concept of this Principal√≠a: #Po√≥n or pun√≤ (chief, leader) ‚Äì principal or head of a lineage. #Gino√≥ ‚Äì a noble by lineage and parentage, family and descent. #Maginoo ‚Äì principal in lineage or parentage. The Spanish term se≈àor (lord) is equated with all these three terms, which are distinguished from the nouveau riche imitators scornfully called Maygintao (man with gold or Hidalgo by gold, and not by lineage).Cf. William Henry Scott, Cracks in the Parchment Curtain, Quezon City: 1998, p. 100. Upon the Christianization of most parts of the Philippine Archipelago, the Datus retained their right to govern their territory under the Spanish Empire.L'institution des chefs de barangay a √©t√© emprunt√©e aux Indiens chez qui on l a trouv√©e √©tablie lors de la conqu√™te des Philippines; ils formaient, √† cette √©poque une esp√®ce de noblesse h√©r√©ditaire. L'h√©r√©dit√© leur a √©t√© conserv√©e aujourd hui: quand une de ces places devient vacante, la nomination du successeur est faite par le surintendant des finances dans les pueblos qui environnent la capitale, et, dans les provinces √©loign√©es, par l alcalde, sur la proposition du gobernadorcillo et la pr√©sentation des autres membres du barangay; il en est de m√™me pour les nouvelles cr√©ations que n√©cessite de temps √† autre l augmentation de la population.

The cabeza, his wife and the eldest of his children are exempt from tributo. After three years of good service, they are granted the title of \\"don\\" and that of \\"pasado\\"; and they remain free from any personal service; they can be elected gobernadorcillos.

King Philip II of Spain, in a law signed June 11, 1594,‚ÄúIt is not right that the Indian chiefs of Filipinas be in a worse condition after conversion; rather they should have such treatment that would gain their affection and keep them loyal, so that with the spiritual blessings that God has communicated to them by calling them to His true knowledge, the temporal blessings may be added and they may live contentedly and comfortably. Therefore, we order the governors of those islands to show them good treatment and entrust them, in our name, with the government of the Indians, of whom they were formerly lords. In all else the governors shall see that the chiefs are benefited justly, and the Indians shall pay them something as a recognition, as they did during the period of their paganism, provided it be without prejudice to the tributes that are to be paid us, or prejudicial to that which pertains to their encomenderos.‚Äù Felipe II, Ley de Junio 11, 1594 in Recapilaci√≥n de leyes, lib. vi, tit.

Picture taken from the exhibit in Villa Escudero Museum in San Pablo Laguna, Philippines. The Filipino royals and nobles formed part of the exclusive, and elite ruling class, called the Principal√≠a (Noble Class) of the Philippines. The Principal√≠a was the class that constituted a birthright aristocracy with claims to respect, obedience, and support from those of subordinate status. With the recognition of the Spanish monarchs came the privilege of being addressed as Don or Do√±a.Cf. Emma Helen Blair and James Alexander Robertson, The Philippine Islands (1493‚Äì1898), Cleveland: The A.H.

Other honors and high regard were also accorded to the Christianized Datus by the Spanish Empire. For example, the Gobernadorcillos (elected leader of the Cabezas de Barangay or the Christianized Datus) and Filipino officials of justice received the greatest consideration from the Spanish Crown officials. The colonial officials were under obligation to show them the honor corresponding to their respective duties. They were allowed to sit in the houses of the Spanish Provincial Governors, and in any other places. They were not left to remain standing. It was not permitted for Spanish Parish Priests to treat these Filipino nobles with less consideration.Emma Helen Blair and James Alexander Robertson, The Philippine Islands (1493‚Äì1898), Cleveland: The A.H.

By the end of the 16th century, any claim to Filipino royalty, nobility, or hidalgu√≠a had disappeared into a homogenized, hispanized and Christianized nobility ‚Äì the Principal√≠a.William Henry Scott, Cracks in the Parchment Curtain, Quezon City: 1998, pp. 117‚Äì118. This remnant of the pre-colonial royal and noble families continued to rule their traditional domain until the end of the Spanish Regime. However, there were cases when succession in leadership was also done through election of new leaders (Cabezas de Barangay), especially in provinces near the central colonial government in Manila where the ancient ruling families lost their prestige and role. Perhaps proximity to the central power diminished their significance. However, in distant territories, where the central authority had less control and where order could be maintained without using coercive measures, hereditary succession was still enforced until Spain lost the Archipelago to the Americans. These distant territories remained Patriarchal societies, where people retained great respect for the Principal√≠a. The Principal√≠a was larger and more influential than the pre-conquest indigenous nobility. It helped create and perpetuate an oligarchic system in the Spanish colony for more than three hundred years.Cf. footnote n.3.Cf. Emma Helen Blair and James Alexander Robertson, The Philippine Islands (1493‚Äì1898), Cleveland: The A.H. Clark Company, 1903, Vol. XVII, p. 331; Ibid., Vol. XL, p. 218. The Spanish colonial government's prohibition for foreigners to own land in the Philippines contributed to the evolution of this form of oligarchy. In some provinces of the Philippines, many Spaniards and foreign merchants intermarried with the rich and landed Austronesian local nobilities. From these unions, a new cultural group was formed, the Mestizo class.Cf. also Encomienda; Hacienda. Their descendants emerged later to become an influential part of the government, and the Principal√≠a. .Cf. The Impact of Spanish Rule in the Philippines in www.seasite.niu.edu.  Political Functions  Anthropologist Laura Lee Junker's comparative analysis of historical accounts from cultures throughout the archipelago, depicts Datus functioning as: *primary political authorities, *war leaders, *legal adjudicators, *the de facto owners of agricultural products and sea resources within a district, *the primary supporters of attached craft specialists, *the overseers of intra-district and external trade, and *the pivotal centers of regional resource mobilization systems. Anthropologists like F. Landa Jocano and Laura Lee Junker and historians and historiographers like William Henry Scott make a careful distinction between the nobility and aristocratic nature of the datus vis a vis the exercise of sovereign political authority. Although the Datus and Paramount Datus of early Philippine polities were a \\"birthright aristocracy\\" and were widely recognized \\"aristocratic\\" or \\"noble,\\" comparable to the nobles and royals of the Spanish colonizers, the nature of their relationship with the members of their Barangay was less asymmetrical than in a monarchic political systems in other parts of the world.McCoy, Alfred W. (1983) An Anarchy of Families: State and Family in the Philippines.Anderson,Benedict. (1983) Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism. Their control over territory was a function of their leadership of the Barangay and, in some local pre-colonial societies (mostly in Luzon), the concept of ruling was not that of \\"divine right.\\" Furthermore, their position was dependent on the common consent of the members of the Barangay's aristocratic Maginoo-class. Although the position of Datu could be inherited, the Maginoo could decide to choose someone else to follow within their own class, if that other person proved a more capable war leader or political administrator. Even \\"Paramount Datus\\" such as Lakans or Rajahs exercised only a limited degree of influence over the less-senior Datus they led, which did not include claims over the barangays and territories of these less-senior datus. Antonio de Morga, in his work Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas, expounds on the degree to which early Philippine Datus could exercise their authority: > \\"There were no kings or lords throughout these islands who ruled over them > as in the manner of our kingdoms and provinces; but in every island, and in > each province of it, many chiefs were recognized by the natives themselves. > Some were more powerful than others, and each one had his followers and > subjects, by districts and families; and these obeyed and respected the > chief. Some chiefs had friendship and communication with others, and at > times wars and quarrels... When any of these chiefs was more courageous than > others in war and upon other occasions, such a one enjoyed more followers > and men; and the others were under his leadership, even if they were chiefs. > These latter retained to themselves the lordship and particular government > of their own following, which is called barangay among them. They had datos > and other special leaders [mandadores] who attended to the interests of the > barangay.\\"  Paramount Datus  The term Paramount Datu or Paramount ruler is a term applied by historians to describe the highest ranking political authorities in the largest lowland polities (see: Barangay state) or inter-polity alliance groups in early Philippine history, most notably those in Maynila, Tondo, Confederation of Madja-as in Panay, Pangasinan, Cebu, Bohol, Butuan, Cotabato, and Sulu. Different cultures of the Philippine archipelago referred to the most senior datu or leader of the \\"Barangay state\\" or \\"Bayan\\" using different titles. In Muslim polities such as Sulu and Cotabato, the Paramount Ruler was called a Sultan. In Tagalog communities, the equivalent title was that of Lakan. In communities which historically had strong political or trade connections with Indianized polities in Indonesia and Malaysia, the Paramount Ruler was called a Rajah. Among the Subanon people of the Zamboanga Peninsula, the most senior Thimuay is referred to as the \\"Thimuay Labi,\\" or as Sulotan in more Islamized Subanon communities. In some other portions of the Visayas and Mindanao, there was no separate name for the most senior ruler, so the Paramount Ruler was simply called a Datu, although one Datu was identifiable as the most senior. Confer also: Non-sovereign monarchy.  Nobility  The noble or aristocratic nature of Datus and their relatives is asserted in folk origin myths,William Henry Scott, Cracks in the Parchment Curtain, Quezon City: 1998, pp. 112- 118. was widely acknowledged by foreigners who visited the Philippine archipelago, and is upheld by modern scholarship. Succession to the position of datu was often (although not always) hereditary, and Datus derived their mandate to lead from their membership in an aristocratic class. Records of Chinese traders and Spanish colonizers describe Datus or Paramount Datus as sovereign princes and principals. Travellers who came to the Philippine archipelago from kingdoms or empires such as Song and Ming dynasty China, or 16th Century Spain, even initially referred to Datus or Paramount Datus as \\"kings,\\" even though they later discovered that Datus did not exercise absolute sovereignty over the members of their Barangays. = Indigenous conceptions of nobility and aristocracy = Manobo bae, a female tribal leader equivalent to a datu, in the 2015 Kaamulan Festival Both now and in early Philippine history, Filipino worldview had a conception of the self or individual being deeply and holistically connected to a larger community, expressed in the Language of Filipino psychology as \\"kapwa.\\" This indigenous conception of self strongly defined the roles and obligations played by individuals within their society. This differentiation of roles and obligations is also more broadly characteristic of Malayo-Polynesian and Austronesian cultures where, as Mulder explains: > \\"...Social life is rooted in the immediate experience of a hierarchically > ordered social arrangement based on the essential inequality of individuals > and their mutual obligations to each other.\\" This \\"essential inequality of individuals and their mutual obligations to each other\\" informed the reciprocal relationships (expressed in the Filipino value of \\"utang na loob\\") that defined the three-tiered social structure typical among early Philippine peoples. These settlements were characterized by a three-tier social structure, which, while slightly different between different cultures and polities, generally included a slave class (alipin/oripun), a class of commoners (timawa), and at the apex, an aristocratic or \\"noble\\" class. The noble class was exclusive, and its members were not allowed to marry outside of the aristocracy. Only members of this cognatically defined social class could rise to the position of Datu. In some cases, such as the more developed Sakop or Kinadatuan in the Visayas (e.g., Panay, Bohol and Cebu), origin myths and other folk narratives firmly placed the datu and the aristocratic class at the top of a divinely sanctioned and stable social order.SCOTT, William Henry (1982). Cracks in the Parchment Curtain, and Other Essays in Philippine History. Quezon City: New Day Publishers. . OCLC 925966, p. 4. These folk narratives portrayed the ancestors of Datus and other nobles as being created by an almighty deity, just like other human beings. But the behavior of these creations determined the social position of their descendants. This conception of social organization even continues to shape Philippine society today despite the introduction of western, externally democratic structures. This has led some sociologists and political scientists to describe the Philippines' political structure as a cacique democracy. = Membership in the aristocratic class = The \\"authority, power, and influence\\" of the Datu (Adjali) emanated primarily from his recognized status within the noble class. Noble birth was not the only factor that determined a datu's political legitimacy, however. Success as a datu was dependent on one's \\"personal charisma, prowess in war, and wealth.\\" = Hereditary succession = The office of Datu was normally passed on through heredity, and even in cases where it was not passed on through direct descent, only a fellow member of the aristocratic class could ascend to the position. In large settlements (called Bayan among the Tagalogs) in which several datus and their barangays lived in close proximity, Paramount Datus were chosen by datus from amongst themselves in a more democratic way, but even this position as most senior among datus was often passed on through heredity. Antonio de Morga, in his work Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas, expounded on this succession through heredity, noting: > \\"These principalities and lordships were inherited in the male line and by > succession of father and son and their descendants. If these were lacking, > then their brothers and collateral relatives succeeded... When any of these > chiefs was more courageous than others in war and upon other occasions, such > a one enjoyed more followers and men; and the others were under his > leadership, even if they were chiefs. These latter retained to themselves > the lordship and particular government of their own following, which is > called barangay among them. They had datos and other special leaders > [mandadores] who attended to the interests of the barangay.\\" =Material affluence= Since the culture of the Pre-colonial societies in the Visayas, Northern Mindanao, and Luzon were largely influenced by Hindu and Buddhist cultures, the Datus who ruled these Principalities (such as Butuan Calinan, Ranau Gandamatu, Maguindanao Polangi, Cebu, Bohol, Panay, Mindoro and Manila) also share the many customs of royalties and nobles in Southeast Asian territories (with Hindu and Buddhist cultures), especially in the way they used to dress and adorn themselves with gold and silk. The Boxer Codex bears testimony to this fact. The measure of the prince's possession of gold and slaves was proportionate to his greatness and nobility.Cf. Report of the Franciscan Fray Letona to Fray Diego Zapata, high Official of the Franciscan Order and of the Inquisition in Emma Helen Blair and James Alexander Robertson, The Philippine Islands (1493‚Äì1898), Cleveland: The A.H. Clark Company, 1903, Vol. XXIX, p. 281. The first Westerners, who came to the Archipelago, observed that there was hardly any \\"Indian\\" who did not possess chains and other articles of gold.Cf. Emma Helen Blair and James Alexander Robertson, The Philippine Islands (1493‚Äì1898), Cleveland: The A.H. Clark Company, 1905, Vol. XXXVI, p. 201. = Foreign Recognition of Nobility = The Spanish colonizers who came in the 1500s acknowledged the nobility of the aristocratic class within early Philippine societies. Morga, for example, referred to them as \\"principalities.\\"Esta institucion (Cabecer√≠a de Barangay), mucho m√°s antigua que la sujecion de las islas al Gobierno, ha merecido siempre las mayores atencion.

Once the Spanish colonial government had been established, the Spanish continued to recognize the descendants of pre-colonial datus as nobles, assigning them positions such as Cabeza de Barangay. Spanish monarchs recognized their noble nature and origin.En el T√≠tulo VII, del Libro VI, de la Recopilaci√≥n de las leyes de los reynos de Las Indias, dedicado a los caciques, podemos encontrar tres leyes muy interesantes en tanto en cuanto determinaron el papel que los caciques iban a desempe√±ar en el nuevo ordenamiento social indiano. Con ellas, la Corona reconoc√≠a oficialmente los derechos de origen prehisp√°nico de estos principales. Concretamente, nos estamos refiriendo a las Leyes 1, 2, dedicadas al espacio americano . Y a la Ley 16, instituida por Felipe II el 11 de junio de 1594 -a similitud de las anteriores-, con la finalidad de que los indios principales de las islas Filipinas fuesen bien tratados y se les encargase alguna tarea de gobierno.

Popular portrayal as \\"monarchs\\" =Early misidentifications of pre-colonial polities in Luzon = When travellers ‚Äì whether traders or colonizers ‚Äì came to the Philippines from cultures which were under a sovereign monarch, these travellers often initially referred to the rulers of Philippine polities as \\"monarchs,\\" implying recognition of their powers as sovereigns. Some early examples were the Song dynasty traders who came to the Philippines and referred to the ruler of Ma-i as a \\"Huang,\\" meaning \\"King\\" ‚Äì an appellation later adopted by the Ming Dynasty courts when dealing with the Philippine archipelago cultures of their own time, such as Botuan and Luzon. Later, the Spanish expeditions of Magellan (in the 1520s) and Legaspi (in the 1570s) initially referred to Paramount Datus (Lakans, Rajahs, Sultans, etc.) as \\"Kings,\\" although the Spanish stopped using this term when the Spanish under the command of Martin de Goiti first forayed out towards the polities in Bulacan and Pampanga in late 1571 and realized that these Kapampanan Datus had a choice not to obey the wishes of the Paramount Datus of Tondo (Lakandula) and Maynila (Rajahs Matanda and Sulayman), leading Lakandula and Sulayman to explain that there was \\"no single king over these lands\\", and that the influence of Tondo and Maynila over the Kapampangan polities did not include either territorial claim or absolute command. Junker and Scott note that this misconception was natural, because both the Chinese and the Spanish came from cultures which had autocratic and imperial political structures. It was a function of language, since their respective sinocentrc and hispanocentric vocabularies were organized around worldviews which asserted the divine right of monarchs. As a result, they tended to project their beliefs into the peoples they encountered during trade and conquest. The concept of a sovereign monarchy was not unknown among the various early polities of the Philippine archipelago, since many of these settlements had rich maritime cultures and traditions, and travelled widely as sailors and traders. The Tagalogs, for example had the word \\"Hari\\" to describe a Monarch. As noted by Fray San Buenaventura (1613, as cited by Junker, 1990 and Scott, 1994), however, the Tagalogs only applied Hari (King) to foreign monarchs, such as those of the Javanese Madjapahit kingdoms, rather than to their own leaders. \\"Datu\\", \\"Rajah,\\" \\"Lakan,\\" etc., were distinct unique words to describe the powers and privilege of indigenous or local rulers and paramount rulers. = Reappropriation of \\"royalty\\" in popular literature = Although early Philippine Datus, Lakans, Rajahs, Sultans, etc., were not sovereign in the political or military sense, they later came to be referred to as such due to the introduction of European literature during the Spanish colonial period.Rafael, Vicente L. (2005) The Promise of the Foreign: Nationalism and the Technics of Translation in the Spanish Philippines. Because of the cultural and political discontinuities that came with colonization, playwrights of Spanish-era Philippine literature such as comedias and zarsuelas did not have precise terminologies to describe former Philippine rulership structures, and began appropriating European concepts, such as \\"king\\" or \\"queen\\" to describe them. Because most Filipinos, even during precolonial times, related with political power structures as outsiders, this new interpretation of \\"royalty\\" was accepted in the broadest sense, and the distinction between monarchy as a political structure vis a vis membership in a hereditary noble line or dynasty, was lost. This much-broader popular conception of monarchy, built on Filipino experiences of \\"great men\\" being socially separate from ordinary people rather than the hierarchical technicalities of monarchies in the political sense, persists today. Common Filipino experience does not usually draw distinctions between aristocracy and nobility vis a vis sovereignty and monarchy. Datus, Lakans, Rajahs, Sultans, etc., are thus referred to as Kings or Monarchs in this non-technical sense, particularly in 20th century Philippine textbooks. The technical distinction between these concepts have only recently been highlighted again, by ethnohistorians, hisotoriographers and anthropologists belonging to the critical scholarship tradition, since their concern is to capture indigenous meanings in the most accurate way possible. Still this assessment of the nature of pre-colonial polities has to be viewed in the context of plurality of pre-colonial social structures existng in the Archipelago. It is obvious that those which existed in Luzon, vary from those that existed in the Visayas and Mindanao. Also, the views of the various authors have to be assessed taking into consideration the background of social constructs, from which they assess the local pre-colonial polities. The historical, politico-cultural and chronological distance of these authors from actual events in the lives of the Filipino pre-colonials has to be taken into consideration. The view of an author living in the 20th century democratic country has a lot of difference from those who came from monarchic societies, who had actual contact with the pre-colonials, and who tried to qualify and approximate the conventions used in local hierarchical structures using the constructs of their time and context, in order to understand their actual experience of contact with what existed in the archipelago during the 16th Century. Honorary datus The title of \\"Honorary Datu\\" has also been conferred to certain foreigners and non-tribe members by the heads of local tribes and Principalities of ancient origin. During the colonial period, some of these titles carried with them immense legal privileges. For example, on January 22, 1878, Sultan Jamalul A'Lam of Sulu appointed the Baron de Overbeck (an Austrian who was then the Austro-Hungarian Empire's Consul-General in Hong Kong) as Datu Bendahara and as Rajah of Sandakan, with the fullest power of life and death over all the inhabitants.Commission from Sultan of Sulu appointing Baron de Overbeck (an Austrian who was then the Austro-Hungarian Empire's Consul-General in Hong Kong) Dato Bendahara and Rajah of Sandakan. Dated January 22, 1878, The National Archives (United Kingdom). On the other hand, in the Philippines, the Spaniards did not practice the granting of honorary titles. Instead, they created nobiliary titles over conquered territories in the Archipelago, in order to reward high Spanish colonial officials. These nobiiary titles are still used in Spain until now by the descendants of the original holders, e.g., Count of Jolo.Conde de Jolo, List of Spanish Nobility.Visconde de Mindanao, List of Spanish Nobility.Marques de Camarines, List of Spanish Nobility. At present, arrangements such as this can no longer carry similar legal bearing under the Philippine laws. The various tribes and claimants to the royal titles of certain indigenous peoples in the Philippines have their own particular or personal customs in conferring local honorary titles, which correspond to the specific and traditional social structures of some indigenous peoples in the Country.Sultanate of SuluWelcome to the official website of the Royal House of Sulu (N.B. In unhispanized, unchristianized and unislamized parts of the Philippines, there exist other structures of society, which do not have hierarchical classes.)Historians classify four types of unhispanized societies in the Philippines, some of which still survive in remote and isolated parts of the Country: 1.) Classless societies; 2.) Warrior societies, characterized by a distinct warrior class, in which membership is won by personal achievement, entails privilege, duty and prescribed norms of conduct, and is requisite for community leadership; 3.) Petty Plutocracies, which are dominated socially and politically by a recognized class of rich men who attain membership through birthright, property and the performance of specified ceremonies. They are \\"petty\\" because their authority is localized, being extended by neither absentee landlordism nor territorial subjugation; and 4.) Principalities. Although in his book, Scot mentioned mostly examples found in Mindanao, however, this form of society was predominant on ths plains of Visayan Islands, as well as in Luzon, during the pre-conquest era. Cf. William Henry Scott, Cracks in the Parchment Curtain, Quezon City: 1998, p. 139. Present day datus A Lumad datu performing in the 2018 Kaamulan Festival of Bukidnon The present day claimants of the precolonial royal/noble title and rank of Datu are of two types. The descendants of rulers of Islamic precolonial polities in Mindanao, and the descendants of the christianized Datus. This second group are those that live in the predominatly Catholic mainstream Filipino society. They are: # The descendants of datus and Sultans of historical and influential precolonial polities that were not totally subjected to Spanish rule, e.g., Sultanate of Jolo, Sultanate of Maguindnao, who still claim at least the titles of their ancestors. # The descendants of the Principal√≠a or the Christianized precolonial Datus and Rajahs, whose status and prerogatives as nobles and former sovereigns were recognized and confirmed by the Spanish Empire. (Examples: descendants of the Christianized last Datus of the Cuyunin tribes of Palawan and the precolonial Datus of Panay, Samar, Leyte, Mindoro, Pampanga, Bulacan, Laguna, Bicol Region, etc.; descendants of the Christianized Rajahs of Cebu, Butuan and Manila; descendants of Christianized Chiefs of precolonial tribes of the Cordilleras and northern Luzon).FERRANDO, Fr Juan & FONSECA OSA, Fr Joaquin (1870‚Äì1872).

OCLC 9362749, p. 146. =Heirs to the precolonial rank of datu in the Catholic parts of the Philippines= In the mainstream Philippine society that is overwhelmingly Catholic, the descendants of the Principal√≠a are the rightful claimants of the ancient sovereign royal and noble ranks of the pre-conquest kingdoms, principalities, and barangays of their ancestors (example:the realm of the Christianized last Datu of the Cuyunin tribes). These descendants of the ancient ruling class are now among the landed aristocracy, intellectual elite, merchants, and politicians in the contemporary Filipino society. These people have had ancestors holding the titles of \\"Don\\" or \\"Do√±a\\", which were also used by Spanish royalties and nobilities during the Spanish colonial period, and still use at present.Cf. Barangay in Enciclopedia Universal Ilustrada Europea- Americana, Madrid: Espasa-Calpe, S. A., 1991, Vol. VII, p.624. The article says: Los nobles de un barangay eran los m√°s ricos √≥ los m√°s fuertes, form√°ndose por este sistema los dattos √≥ maguinoos, principes √° quienes heredaban los hijos mayores, las hijas √° falta de √©stos, √≥ los parientes m√°s pr√≥ximos si no ten√≠an descendencia directa; pero siempre teniendo en cuenta las condiciones de fuerza √≥ de dinero...Los vassalos plebeyos ten√≠an que remar en los barcos del maguinoo, cultivar sus campos y pelear en la guerra.

It should also be noted that the more popular and official term used to refer to the leaders of the district or to the cacique during the Spanish period was Cabeza de Barangay. =Philippine Constitution and the Law on Indigenous Minorities on the contemporary usage of the title Datu= A 1926 photograph of Bagobo (Manobo) warriors in full armour. The Bagobo are one of several Lumad tribes in Mindanao. Article VI, Section 31 of the 1987 Constitution explicitly forbids the creation, granting, and use of new royal or noble titles. Titles of \\"Honorary Datu\\" conferred by various ethnic groups to certain foreigners and non-tribe members by local chieftains are only forms of local award or appreciation for some goods or services done to a local tribe or to the person of the chieftain, and are not legally binding. Any contrary claim is otherwise unconstitutional under Philippine law.Philippine Constitution, Article VI, Section 31. However, through the Indigenous Peoples' Rights Act of 1997, the Republic also protects the peculiar situation of tribal minorities and their traditional indigenous social structures. This special law allows members of indigenous minority tribes to be conferred with traditional leadership titles, including the title Datu, in a manner specified under the Law's Implementing rules and guidelines (Administrative Order No. 1, Series of 1998, of the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples specifically under Rule IV, Part I, Section 2, a-c), which read: :a) Right to Confer Leadership Titles. The ICCs/IPs concerned, in accordance with their customary laws and practices, indigenous peoples shall have the sole right to vest titles of leadership such as, but not limited to, Bae, Datu, Baylan, Timuay, Likid and such other titles to their members. :b) Recognition of Leadership Titles. To forestall undue conferment of leadership titles and misrepresentations, the ICCs/IPs concerned, may, at their option, submit a list of their recognized traditional socio-political leaders with their corresponding titles to the NCIP. The NCIP through its field offices, shall conduct a field validation of said list and shall maintain a national directory thereof. :c) Issuance of Certificates of Tribal Membership. Only the recognized registered leaders are authorized to issue certificates of tribal membership to their members. Such certificates shall be confirmed by the NCIP based on its census and records and shall have effect only for the purpose for which it was issued. From the above-mentioned ordinance of the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples, the current usage of the title Datu for newly created offices of leadership of tribal minorities does not accord nobility, which is forbidden by the Constitution of the republican State.Philippine Constitution, Article VI, Section 31. =Precolonial Polities and Fons honorum= The fons honorum (source of honour) in the modern Philippine state is the sovereign Filipino people, who are equal in dignity under a democratic form of government.Philippine Constitution. The Philippine government grants state honours and decorations, and through the system of awards and decorations of its Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine National Police. These honours do not grant or create titles of royalty or nobility, in accordance with the Constitution. Deducing from the theory of Jean Bodin (1530‚Äì1596), a French jurist and political philosopher, it could be said that ancient Filipino royalties, who never relinquished their sovereign rights by voluntary means (according to opinions of some historians), of whom the sovereign powers over their territories (de facto sovereignty) passed on to the Spanish jura regalia through some disputed means, retain their \\"fons honorum\\" as part of their de jure sovereignty. Therefore, as long as the blood is alive in the veins of these royal houses, de jure sovereignty is alive as well‚Äîwhich means they can still bestow titles of nobility. However, the practical implications of this claim is unclear, e.g., in the case of usurpation of titles by other members of the bloodline.‚ÄúThere are not a few judgments, civil and criminal, albeit some very recent, all of which to accept traditional principles re-enunciated not long since. The issue is that of innate nobility‚Äîjure sanguinis‚Äîthat looks into the prerogatives known as jus majestatis and jus honorum, and argues that the holder of such prerogatives is a subject of international law with the logical consequences of that situation. That is to say, a deposed sovereign may legitimately confer titles of nobility, with or without predicates, and the honorifics that pertain to his heraldic patrimony as head of his dynasty. The qualities that render a deposed Sovereign a subject of international law are undeniable, and in fact constitute an absolute personal right the subject may never divest himself of, and that needs no ratification or recognition from any other authority. A reigning Sovereign or Head of State may use the term recognition\\\\ to demonstrate the existence of such a right, but the term is a mere declaration and not a constitutive act‚Äù. A notable example of this principle is that of the People's Republic of China, which for a considerable time was not recognized and therefore not admitted to the United Nations, but nonetheless continued to exercise its functions as a sovereign state through both its internal and external organs. ‚ÄúThe prerogatives we are examining may be denied and a sovereign state within the limits of its own sphere of influence may prevent the exercise by a deposed Sovereign of his rights in the same way as it may paralyze the use of any right not provided in its own legislation. However such negating action does not go to the existence of such a right and bears only on its exercise. To sum up, therefore, the Italian judiciary, in those cases submitted to its jurisdiction, has confirmed the prerogatives jure sanguinis of a dethroned Sovereign without any vitiation of its effects, whereby in consequence it has explicitly recognized the right to confer titles of nobility and other honorifics relative to his dynastic heraldic patrimony. In particular it has defined the above-mentioned honorifics, among which are those non-national Orders mentioned in Article 7 of the (Italian) Law of the 3rd. March 1951, which prohibits private persons from conferring honors. As to titles of nobility, while their bestowal is legitimate, it must be observed that they receive no protection whatsoever from Italian law, which no longer recognizes statutory nobility, in accordance with the principles enshrined in the Constitution of the Republic. Thus, the concept of the usurpation of a nobiliary title falls outside of Italian legislation.‚Äù Cf. Professor Emilio Furno (Advocate in the Italian Supreme Court of Appeal), The Legitimacy of Non-National Orders in Rivista Penale, No.1, January 1961, pp. 46‚Äì70. Heads of Dynasties (even the deposed ones) belong to one of the three kinds of sovereignty that has been existing in human society. The other two are: Heads of States (of all forms of government, e. g., monarchy, republican, communist, etc.), and Traditional Heads of the Church (both Roman Catholic and Orthodox). The authority that emanates from this last type is transmitted through an authentic Apostolic Succession,Cf. also Paulo Bonavides, Political Sciences (Ci√™ncia Pol√≠tica), p. 126. i.e., direct lineage of ordination and succession of Office from the Apostles (from St. Peter, in case of the Supreme Pontiff of the Roman Catholic Church ‚Äì the Pope).Annuario Pontificio 2012 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2012 ), p. 12.Cf. Vatican Council II, Dogmatic Constitution on the Church Lumen gentium, n. 8. These sovereign authorities exercise the following sovereign rights and powers: Ius Imperii (the right to command and rule a territory or a juridical entity); Ius Gladii (the right to impose obedience through command and also control armies); Ius Majestatis (the right to be honored and respected according to one's title); and Ius Honorum (the right to award titles, merits and rights). Considering the theory of Jean Bodin, that \\"Sovereignty is one and indivisible, it cannot be delegated, sovereignty us irrevocable, sovereignty is perpetual, sovereignty is a supreme power\\", one can argue about the rights of deposed dynasties, also as fons honorum. It can be said that their Ius Honorum depends on their rights as a family, and does not depend on the authority of the \\"de facto\\" government of a State. This is their de jure right. Even though it is not a de facto right, it is still a right. But again, in case of conflict of norms on fons honorum in actual situations, the legislations of the de facto sovereign authority have precedence. All others are abrogated, unless otherwise recognized under the terms of such de facto authority.Also cf. Professor Emilio Furno (Advocate in the Italian Supreme Court of Appeal), The Legitimacy of Non-National Orders in Rivista Penale, No.1, January 1961, pp. 46‚Äì70. This is the view to reconsider when we study sovereignty based on the political impact of the 1987 Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines to the some polities that have been existing since the pre-colonial period, e.g., Sultanate of Sulu, Sultanate of Maguindanao.

He is best known for playing with Helloween, Gamma Ray, Masterplan and Holy Moses, among others. He is also known for his technical style of playing, fast-paced speed metal-like rhythm, and capable songwriting abilities. Biography During the 1980s and early 1990s, he used to be a studio musician and played for many bands, such as Holy Moses, Mekong Delta among others. In 1990, after first drummer of Gamma Ray Mathias Burchardt quit the band, Kai Hansen recruited Uli to perform for his band. In 1991, this lineup released their second full-length studio album, labeled Sigh No More and went on a world tour. However, Uli quit Gamma Ray in 1992. He Joined Axe La Chapelle 1993 and played the drums for the album \\"Grab What You Can\\" before he joined Helloween, with whom he released Master of the Rings in 1994 and The Time of the Oath in 1996. That same year Helloween released the 2-CD live album High Live, providing a decent demonstration of Uli's skills for performing live. That time Uli himself formed and produced with Gamma Ray guitarist Henjo Richter the Rainbow tribute band Catch the Rainbow and soon other musicians joined them. Their album A Tribute to Rainbow, with eleven covers of Rainbow songs, was released in 1999. It featured other members of Helloween and Gamma Ray as well as other bands. He also played in Markus Grosskopf's side-project Shockmachine for their only album in 1998. Helloween recorded Better Than Raw the same year, followed by the band's album of covers Metal Jukebox in 1999. Uli stayed with Helloween up to 2000's The Dark Ride, developing into a key songwriter for the band. Kusch also played on Sinner's 2000 album The End of Sanctuary. In 2001, Uli and fellow bandmember Roland Grapow were fired from Helloween, following an e-mail from Michael Weikath. The two went on to form Masterplan, something they had originally been planning as a side project. With Masterplan Kusch recorded two studio albums, one self-titled in 2003 and Aeronautics in 2005. That same year, Uli formed a new band called Beautiful Sin with help from Masterplan bandmate Axel Mackenrott and members of Pagan's Mind. Uli departed from Masterplan in October 2006 for personal and musical differences. He said at the time that Beautiful Sin became his new main priority. Uli also co-founded a new progressive power metal project called Ride the Sky, which released its debut album New Protection under Nuclear Blast Records on 24 August 2007, but the band broke up in April 2008 due to poor media attention and minor support from the record company. He has also rejoined the progressive thrash metal outfit Mekong Delta and recorded the album Lurking Fear with the band. In late 2010, Uli joined Symfonia, a power metal supergroup formed together by Andr√© Matos, Timo Tolkki, Jari Kainulainen and Mikko H√§rkin. They made their debut performance at Finnish Metal Expo 2011. The band entered the studio in November 2010 to begin recording their debut album, In Paradisum and was released on 25 March 2011. During the preparations for the upcoming tour, Uli suffered from nerve damage in his left hand which led the band to hire Alex Landenburg as his replacement for the debut performance at Finnish Metal Expo, as well as some other dates. Latest news is that Uli has officially left the band to continue recovering from his nerve damage which made it impossible for him to play drums for a year. Since 2013 Uli is teaching drums at the \\"Kulturskole Trysil /Norway\\" and playing as a freelancer.

It charted at number twenty-seven in the UK. In 2013, NME ranked it at number 473 in its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.Rocklist.net NME: The 500 Greatest Albums Of All Time : October 2013 Background and recording The album was recorded at Sawmills Studios in Cornwall over a seven-week period between December 1992 and January 1993, with John Leckie in the producer's chair, and took its title from Jay Stevens' book Storming Heaven, which detailed the effects of LSD on the United States during the counterculture movement of the 1960s.Storm in Heaven Collector's Deluxe Reissue (Liner Notes) Two decades after the album's release Leckie admitted that he jumped at the chance to produce the band as they were \\"one of the only bands that I‚Äôve ever begged to work with... I just couldn‚Äôt believe what I was witnessing.\\" Of the ten songs that comprise the album, only three had been played live before recording ‚Äì \\"Slide Away\\", \\"Already There\\" and \\"The Sun, The Sea\\". The remaining seven songs emanated from studio jam sessions. \\"[The album] was pretty much improvised,\\" bass player Simon Jones recalled, stating that the band took a \\"bold\\" decision not to include their earlier singles on the record. According to Leckie, the band's compositional practices would regularly see them working until \\"four a.m. every night ... they were quite a nocturnal band ... they didn't get much sleep. They smoked a lot of dope.\\" The band's guitarist, Nick McCabe, favored a sound that \\"was about the tape echo and the reverb\\" in contrast to the prevailing orthodoxy of studio recording at the time, which he bemoaned as being \\"still stuck in the aesthetics of 80s recording techniques.\\" According to his bandmate Jones, McCabe \\"didn‚Äôt treat the guitar like a guitar... He didn‚Äôt want to be a guitar hero. He wasn‚Äôt into Jimmy Page... It was all about texture.\\" The band incorporated a range of diverse influences while composing the music, ranging from Cocteau Twins and Can to free jazz. Penultimate track \\"Butterfly\\" was reportedly recorded at three a.m. while playing along with a Steely Dan sample. Drummer Peter Salisbury's percussion drew inspiration from Dr. John's Gris-Gris album, while the brass section from the Kick Horns on \\"The Sun, The Sea\\" and \\"Butterfly\\" was influenced by Fun House. \\"The band that Virgin signed, we ditched early on\\", McCabe said, \\"... early demos were like Rolling Stones power-pop tunes. They bore no relation to what ended up on A Storm in Heaven.\\" Two versions of \\"Virtual World\\" were recorded, one featuring Yvette Lacey on flute (who had previously contributed to \\"Gravity Grave\\") and the other with slide guitar from McCabe. \\"Already There\\" is notable for being the only song by The Verve on which Richard Ashcroft and McCabe collaborated on the lyrics. While recording, Ashcroft would often improvise lyrics on the spot ‚Äì the vocal take for \\"Blue\\" was only completed at six a.m. on the day that the band's record label were scheduled to receive the album's master tapes. Album sleeve and artwork As with all of the band's releases, A Storm in Heaven features artwork shot by Michael Spencer Jones and designed by Brian Cannon who described in a 1998 feature on the band in Select Magazine the inspiration behind the design. According to Cannon the sleeve was done \\"in the days when we had loads of time to do the job. In the end, this image of a journey of life almost seemed to create itself. It's four scenes - birth, youth, middle age and old age. The front cover is Thor's Cave near Leek in northern Staffordshire, the burning car scene is in Billinge, the cellar is in Upholland and the old man in Richard's clothes is Birkdale cemetery. The 'youth' part is the car on fire, and the band just playing chess to give off a 'we-don't-give-a-shit' vibe.\\"http://selectmagazinescans.monkeon.co.uk/showpage.php?file=wp- content/uploads/2012/10/verve.jpg Reception A Storm in Heaven was met with mixed-to-positive reviews upon its release in 1993. Writing in Select, Andrew Collins said, \\"It's self-consciously rockier and more macho... the guitar often an aggressor and the voice a self-styled exotic mystery. On occasion, it actually sounds like The House of Love on valium.\\" Lorraine Ali of the Los Angeles Times said, \\"this debut album makes its mark regardless. Singer Richard Ashcroft's whimsical, occasionally soul-wrenching vocals breeze in and out of delicate guitar interludes and hallucinatory washes of tumbling melody. Verve's \\"Storm\\" is a warm, inviting chill-out.\\" Q was less enthusiastic, awarding the album two out of five upon release. Vox magazine awarded the album six out of ten, noting that \\"song structure and silly things like choruses are subservient to atmosphere and vibes.\\" Legacy The album has gone on to accumulate further praise in the years since its release and has been described by one publication as The Verve's \\"masterpiece\\" and a landmark in psychedelic rock. Rudi Abdallah, writing for Drowned in Sound, declared that the \\"sounds explored on [A Storm in Heaven] are The Verve‚Äôs true form, the intuitive sound with which they should be identified.\\" Nick Southall's 2003 retrospective for Stylus Magazine described the album's genesis as a result of the band going ‚Äúinto the studio with half a dozen riffs, half a dozen half-baked lyrics and a thousand ideas of ways to reach the sky. Leckie managed to seize the controls and apply the necessary degree of restraint and maturity, guiding the band back down to earth when they threatened to fly too close to the sun.‚Äù In September 2016, Ian King, writing for PopMatters, awarded the album nine out of ten and remarked, \\"The greatest depth on A Storm in Heaven comes from the vaporous dreams that poured out of McCabe's guitar, traced patiently by Simon Jones' bass playing and Peter Salisbury's drumming. Though the Verve were able to compress their sound into radio-shaped singles \\"Slide Away\\" and \\"Blue\\", the most compelling compositions -- \\"Already There\\", \\"Beautiful Mind\\", \\"Virtual World\\"‚Äîare those that are allowed to naturally ebb and flow in a zone somewhere between pop editing and the looser jamming of the material that turned up on their singles and EPs\\". Reflecting on the album's legacy, McCabe said \\"I think something of us as a band got lost after [A Storm in Heaven] ... For the next ten years after that, that sensation was missing from the music for me. That was the last time we made that kind of landscape for the imagination to run about in.\\" John Leckie admitted having mixed feelings about the record; \\"We were searching for things and waiting for things, and waiting for it to rain down on us... We came close but neither they nor I thought they managed it. It lacked the overwhelming effect of the Verve experience, maybe as there was no audience to feed off.\\" The album would mark the band's last official release under the Verve moniker before changing their name to \\"The Verve\\" for legal reasons, so as not to clash with the record label Verve Records.

It is aimed at propagation of puritanical interpretation of Islam, and dawah (proselytization). The organization operates pesantren (Islamic seminary), mass media, women's division, and coop. History =Origin= Hidayatullah was founded on 7 January 1973 (2 Dzulhijjah 1392 Hijriah), by Ustadz Abdullah Said in Balikpapan as a form of pesantren (Islamic school, most of whom are boarders). From a pesantren, Hidayatullah was developed further with many activities such as social, mission, education and economy programs and spread to many regions. As of 2003, this institution had networks in 200 cities, in every province in Indonesia. By the first national meeting on July 9‚Äì13, 2000 in Balikpapan, Hidayatullah changed its form to a mass organization and declared itself as an Islamic Struggle Movement. Organization =Mission= Its mission is to realize society based on Al- Qur'an that free from thoughts, ism and attitude that allying Allah (syirik). The strengthen of sentence of tauhid ‚ÄúLaa ilaaha illallah‚Äù on earth ¬∑ The executing of Syari‚Äôah Islam by whole Muslims ¬∑ Realization of the strength of Islam people in many life area ¬∑ The birth of combatant cadre ¬∑ Increase of standing, degree and prestige of the weak and oppressed onesTake role effectively in doing reform process (tajdid) in philosophy of Islam thought as basic for development of Islam civilization in the future ¬∑ Prepare concept and strategy of struggle accurately ¬∑ Prepare and build organizations of dakwah, education, social, politic, youth, female matters, and others that are strong, solid, modern and professional ¬∑ Labouring and pushing the efforts on enhancing the quality of human resources.

While the main agenda that becomes focus work is: streamlining of aqidah, leadership and organization matters (tajdid); awareness brighten (tilawatu ayatillah); soul purify (tazkiyatun-nufus); instruction and education (ta‚Äôlimatul-kitab wal-hikmah) going to the birth of leadership and best ummah. =Belief= Hidayatullah was born when Muslims were awaiting the coming of a XV Hijriah century, believed to be the era of Islam resurrection. The main theme at that time was ‚ÄúBack to Qur'an and Sunnah.‚Äù Hidayatullah is a thought movement that tries to interpret ‚ÄúBack to Qur‚Äôan and Sunnah‚Äù more concretely, so, Al-Qur'an and Sunnah became a blueprint for Islam civilization development. Hidayatullah believes that the setback of Muslems is mostly caused by a partial understanding of the universality of Islam. Each group takes the theme and program focus according to their partial view, and then even theme and program focus become a kind of group ideology. As an Islam mass organization that is based on cadre, Hidayatullah claims themselves to be an Islamic Struggle Movement (Al-Harakah Al-Jihadiyah Al-Islamiyah) with dakwah (mission) and tarbiyah (education) as main programs. =Membership= As a mass organization, membership of Hidayatullah is inclusive, and so its mission, vision, and movement basic concept. Hidayatullah makes its affiliates and related institutions autonomous and function as educational basic and member recruitment. Hidayatullah is an institution for Moslems that want to realize their idealism to build Islamic society, refer to prophet method (manhaj nubuwwah). Hidayatullah is steadfast in its adherence to the Al Quran and Sunnah. Its obedience toward Allah and Muhammad is absolute; therefore all matters must be returned to Allah and Muhammad. Hidayatullah opened its membership in January 2001 to all adult Muslim. Becoming a member of Hidayatullah means taking part in a new wave of campaigns to uphold the faith: Laa Ilaaha illallah ‚Äì Muhammad. Members are entitled to training and education that will result in the establishment of Hidayatullah cadres. They are then expected to give back to society by bringing to it Islamic solutions to various problems. =Organizational structure= Central Official Members consist of the Council of Sharia, the Council of Representatives (Syura) and the Central Executive Board.

General Leader ratifies Central Executive Board in national deliberation for 5 years duration. Structures under Central Executive Board consist of Regional Executive Boards, Area Executive Boards (sub-province), Branch Executive Boards (district), and Subsection Executive Boards (sub-district). The chief of regional Executive Board downwards selected by deliberation in each level and have responsibility upwards and also to constituents.

Its Chairman of Sharia Council is Abdurrahman Muhammad, while its Chairman of Syura is Abdul Qadir Jailani. Activity =Dakwah= Hidayatullah main program is dakwah (mission) and tarbiyah (education). Since its first step, Hidayatullah have sent students to do dakwah as part of education process. Existence of Hidayatullah in various places is an effort to build wide dakwah network and can reach and serve all levels of ummah. Hidayatullah tries to put da‚Äôi as ‚Äúmissionaries of Islam‚Äù so that the profile of da‚Äôi is ones who have excellent and militant characteristic and also have potency to build a balance civilization between earthly and eternity. Since 1978 Hidayatullah have sent da‚Äôi around the country. Hidayatullah tries to enhance the quality of da‚Äôi by founding Religion College of Islam Lukman Al Hakim (STAIL) in Surabaya and Moslem Law Science College of Hidayatullah (STIS) in Balikpapan as education institutes for cadre of da‚Äôi. Because of profession of da‚Äôi more tend to dedication therefore Hidayatullah give full scholarship (expense of living cost and education) for students of STAIL and STIS with tenure pattern. In this way expected can be yielded da‚Äôi with stratum one qualification in education, dakwah and syariah who have militant soul, ready to be assigned entire Indonesia, expected can stay permanently, given subsidy for maximal 3 years or till they able to be economic performer where they are assigned. Since year 1998 this cadre of da‚Äôi education institute have yielded and sent its grads to various area especially east and middle Indonesia. Every year Hidayatullah sends at least 150 da‚Äôi to many regions in Indonesia with 50 among them are stratum one grads from cadre of da‚Äôi education institute. All Hidayatullah cadres are expected to go out preaching to the general public every Saturday. =Education= In second 25 years step of Hidayatullah, education has a central and strategic role, especially when it is connected with effort to enhance human resources quality. It is caused by the realization for human standing and prestige increase and socialization of Islam values can be done only by high quality human resource. According to Islam terminology, high quality human resource is human being capable to use all thinking and recitation potency inside himself or herself well balanced so that all domination of science, domination of technology and his/her skill give benefit to himself/herself, his/her environmental and world generally. Therefore, the development of human resource must be focused on the principles of tauhid and good behaviour without ignoring standing of intellectuality. Hidayatullah introduces concept of integral Islam education and implement it in management of Hidayatullah schools from kindergarten until college level. The \\"integral\\" term shows a unity of all existing element, either faith and godly and science and technology, school and society, formal and non-formal, etc. Hidayatullah education institute covers Kindergarten and Play Group, Elementary School or Madrasah Ibtidaiyah in almost all areas, Junior High School/Madrasah Tsanawiyah and Senior High School/Madrasah Aliyah at least in each region and 3 colleges in Surabaya, Balikpapan and Depok. Beside Religion College of Islam Lukman Al Hakim (STAIL) in Surabaya and Moslem Law Science College of Hidayatullah (STIS) in Balikpapan as education institute for da'i cadre, Hidayatullah is starting Management Science College in Depok that is expected can yield grads that able to manage the Hidayatullah charitable efforts including economic efforts. Opening Hidayatullah's 2016 national conference, Riau Islands governor Nurdin Basirun welcomed the large scale and success of the organisation's many schools. Pesantren Hidayatullah pesantrens as does pesantrens in other places, have function as place to deepen science of religion. Pesantren with width of campus it had also have function as miniature or sample project to leadership and organized life in Islam. Besides dwelt by students who live in hostel, pesantren is also dwelt by teachers, nursemaid, organizer and jamaah of Hidayatullah that willing to live in pesantren in order to learn how to live in leadership and be organized. With all limitation but with full seriousness, we try to strengthen syariah. Leadership is obeyed; obligation to do shalat, fast and tithe, charity and alms is intensified. =Empowerment of vulnerable people= Centre Education of Pious Child (Pusat Pendidikan Anak Shaleh - PPAS) is institution in the form of pesantren for orphans and poor children that place priority on growth of religious values through the reading of the Qur'an (tilawah), sanctifying of soul (tazkiyah), and studying (ta‚Äôlimah). PPAS with its management have a multi-dimension characteristic for children; as substitute of parents, mini laboratory of life, and place to strengthen faith and enhance knowledge. Aside from expectation to minimize economic inabilities, PPAS are expected to be able to produce cadres of combatant (mujahid) that will be ahead in the front line to straighten up the pennant of Islam. The existence of more than 200 PPAS with averagely 150 orphans and poor children per PPAS is prove of the siding of Hidayatullah's to the weak (dhu‚Äôafa) and the oppressed ones (mustadh‚Äôafin), the orphans and poor children. This is one of commitments that get primary attention since the beginning of Hidayatullah's steps. =Baitul Maal Hidayatullah= Baitul Maal Hidayatullah (BMH) is an institute under Hidayatullah that have functions to manage funds of ummah's zakat, infaq, shadaqah and waqaf.

Considering what a strategic is dakwah through mass media, the bulletin continues to be developed.

In it there is rubric interview popular figure, study of Al-Qur'an and Hadits, heroic story of struggle of da‚Äôi in various area all over the country, till the problem of family.

This concern was behind the sending, since early 1980s, of da‚Äôi (religious teachers or preachers) to the hinterland. Most of the da‚Äôi have since built their own pesantren in areas where they were posted ‚Äìthis in addition to the continued effort of the Hidayatullah to develop boarding schools in whatever regions where there are none. The province of Papua is another focus of attention of the Hidayatullah. Its da‚Äôis can be found in almost all cities and towns of the province, whose main activity is building the Islamic Boarding Schools for local children . The same drive of the Hidayatullah preachers could be said for those posted in East Timor before the territory's independence from Indonesia.

Church in Schellerten- Farmsen, Lower Saxony, Germany. Saint Gotthard (or Godehard) (960 ‚Äì 5 May 1038 AD; ), also known as Gothard or Godehard the Bishop, was a German bishop venerated as a saint. Life Gotthard was born in 960 near Niederaltaich in the diocese of Passau. Gotthard studied the humanities and theology at Niederaltaich Abbey, where his father Ratmund was a vassal of the canons. While at the abbey, Gotthard was placed under the guidance of Uodalgisus. Gotthard then resided at the archiepiscopal court of Salzburg, where he served as an ecclesiastical administrator. After traveling through various countries, including Italy, Gotthard completed his advanced studies under the guidance of Liutfrid in the cathedral school at Passau. He then joined the canons at Niederaltaich in 990, and became their provost in 996. When Henry II of Bavaria decided to transform the chapter house of Niederaltaich into a Benedictine monastery Gotthard remained there as a novice, subsequently becoming a monk there in 990 under the abbot Ercanbertn. In 993, Gotthard was ordained a priest, in addition to becoming a prior and rector of the monastic school. In 996, when he was elected abbot, Gotthard introduced the Cluniac reforms at Niederaltaich. He helped revive the Rule of St. Benedict, which then provided abbots for the abbeys of Tegernsee, Hersfeld and Kremsm√ºnster to restore Benedictine observance, under the patronage of Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor. He became bishop of Hildesheim on 2 December 1022, being consecrated by Aribo, Archbishop of Mainz. During the 15 years of his episcopal government, while earning the respect of the clergy, Gotthard ordered the construction of some 30 churches. Despite his advanced age, he defended the rights of his diocese vigorously. After a brief sickness, he died on 5 May 1038. Veneration Tympanum depicting Christ, Gotthard and St. Epiphanius. Hildesheim, St. Godehard Basilica. Gotthard's successors in the episcopate of Hildesheim, Bertold (1119‚Äì30) and Bernhard I (1130‚Äì53), pushed for his canonization. This was accomplished during the episcopate of Bernard, in 1131, and it took place at a synod in Rheims. There, Pope Innocent II, in the presence of Bernard and Saint Norbert of Xanten, officially made Gotthard a saint. On 4 May 1132, Bernard translated Gotthard's relics from the abbatial church to the cathedral at Hildesheim. On 5 May the first liturgical festivity in honor of Gotthard was celebrated. Miracles were attributed to the relics. Veneration of the saint spread to Scandinavia, Switzerland, and Eastern Europe. Gotthard was invoked against fever, dropsy, childhood sicknesses, hailstones, the pain of childbirth, and gout. Furthermore, Niederaltaich Abbey made its famous abbot the patron saint of the abbey's well-known grammar school, the St.-Gotthard-Gymnasium. Gotthard also became the patron saint of traveling merchants, and thus many churches and chapels were dedicated to him in the Alps. His hospice for travellers near Hildesheim (the \\"Mauritiusstift\\"), became famous. According to an ancient Ticinese tradition, the little church in St. Gotthard Pass (San Gottardo) in the Swiss Alps was founded by Galdino, Archbishop of Milan (r. 1166-76). Goffredo da Bussero, however, attributes the founding of the church to Enrico di Settala, Bishop of Milan from 1213 to 1230. The hospice was entrusted to the care of the Capuchin Order in 1685 by Federico II Visconti, and later passed under the control of a confraternity of Ticino.

The essay does not provide any information that a man of politics such as Cicero would not already know, and is written in a highly rhetorical fashion. As such, its authenticity has been questioned. Many scholars believe that it was not in fact written by Quintus for the purposes proposed, but in fact by a Roman in the Early Roman Empire, between the periods of Augustus and Trajan, as a rhetorical exercise. Such exercises were not uncommon in that time period. Others claim that it was in fact written by Quintus, but with the view to be published, perhaps as a piece of carefully distributed propaganda. The degree to which it can be used as evidence for the electoral process and the politics of the Late Roman Republic is therefore contested.  Manuscript tradition  The text of the Commentariolum Petitionis is not found in the Codex Mediceus, the best source for M. Cicero's Epistulae ad Familiares (Letters to his Friends). It does appear at the end of the Epistulae ad Quintum Fratrem (Letters to Quintus) in the codices Berolinensis and Harleianus, although Harleianus only includes sections 1-8 of the 58 sections given in the other manuscripts.J. M. David et al., \\"Le 'Commentariolum Petitionis' de Quintus Cic√©ron\\" in ANRW 1.3 (Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, 1973), 243-245.  Linguistic arguments  Three key points can be identified, particularly from the works of EussnerA. Eussner, Commentariolum petitionis examinatum et emendatum (W√ºrzburg, 1872) and Hendrickson,John L. Hendrickson, \\"On the Authenticity of the Commentariolum Petitionis of Quintus Cicero,\\" The American Journal of Philology 13.2 13.2 (1892): 200-212 which summarise the linguistic arguments:David et al., 250. # The vocabulary of the Commentariolum is not what was generally being used at the time Cicero was running for the office of consul. The use of suffragatorius in the Commentariolum is a hapax legomenon. There is some strange phrasing such as 'cur ut' and 'fac ut'. # The style of the Commentariolum does not match the style of Quintus. (Hendrickson also claims that the dry style shows that it is a school exercise.Hendrickson, 208.) # In the Commentariolum there are a number of linguistic structures, metaphors, and phrases corresponding to the later works of Cicero: In Toga Candida (64 BC), Pro Murena (62 BC), and Oratio de Haruspicum Responsis (56 BC). The first two arguments have been largely refuted. Tyrell-PurserR. Tyrell and L.C. Purser, The Correspondence of Cicero, I, (London: 1904, reprinted 1960) show that at least one other hapax occurs in Quintus, and that some phrases questioned by Eussner have been found in the works of Cicero and Plautus. They further argue that, with only four of Quintus' letters extant, and those fragmentary, it is difficult to gauge his style. The laudations of M. Cicero for his younger brother's style may also have been a matter of brotherly hyperbole. The third argument cannot be refuted. Though some similarities in the Pro Murena could be due to similar subject matter, the correlations between the extant fragments of In Toga Candida and the Commentariolum are too strong to be ignored. These correlations can be (and are) argued in the opposite direction as well, however; the similarities between the Commentariolum and M. Cicero's later works may be the result of M. Cicero being influenced by the letter from his brother.  Arguments of content  HendersonM. I. Henderson, \\"De commentariolo petitionis,\\" The Journal of Roman Studies 40.1-2 (1950):8-21 presents many arguments to say that the content of the Commentariolum is anachronistic or faulty: # The faults attributed to Catilina in Commentariolum 10 are actually those given to Clodius in De Haruspicum Responsis 42. # The proscription of C. Antonius Hybrida is backdated, and actually occurred in 59. # The trial of Q. Gallius, referenced in the Commentariolum, did not occur until 64, but after the Commentariolum # The author of the Commentariolum was unaware of the dual meaning of sodalitas, equally 'group of friends' and an illegal electoral group. # The humanitas of Cicero is backdated; it cannot be attributed to him until after his philosophical works (55-44 BC) # There is no mention of the Catilinarian Conspiracy, which disappears from the historical record after Livy. BalsdonJ. P. V. D. Balsdon, \\"The Commentariolum Petitions,\\" The Classics Quarterly 13.2 (November 1963): 242-250. argues against many of Henderson's claims in favour of authenticity, stating that the similarities between the Commentariolum and De Haruspicum Responsis could be a matter of rhetorical similarities only. He suggests that Q. Gallius may have been tried twice, or may have entered into counsel with Cicero as early as 66 BC, though the trial did not take place for a couple years. He also suggests that the meaning of sodalitas was not changed to mean an illegal electoral group until 59. He is joined by NisbetR. G. M. Nisbet, \\"The Commentariolum Petitionis: Some Arguments Against Authenticity,\\" The Journal of Roman Studies 19.3 (July 1970): 384-385. (who argues against authenticity) in suggesting that the proscription of Antonius may have had a far more quotidian meaning, such as the selling of property after bankruptcy, than Henderson seems to be reading into it. RichardsonJohn S. Richardson, \\"The 'Commentariolum Petitionis',\\" Historia: Zeitschrift f√ºr Alte Geschichte 20.4 (3rd Qtr., 1971): 436-442. finally notes that the First Catilinarian Conspiracy is not mentioned until In Toga Candida, and as such takes its omission as proof of authenticity. Nisbet adds to the arguments of context the fact that the Commentariolum identifies Cicero as worthy (dignus) of defending consulars, though at the time of his electoral campaign, Cicero had not defended anyone in court who had held the consulship. (This section of the Commentariolum also corresponds to a section of In Toga Candida.) Nisbet rejects that this could simply be an allusion to potentialities on the basis that this would be bad rhetorical form. McDermottWilliam C. McDermott, \\"Commentariolum Petitionis 2,\\" Historia: Zeitschrift f√ºr Alte Geschichte 19.3 (July 1970): 384-385. counters that Cicero may have already agreed to defend Piso, and this would be the sort of thing known by his brother Quintus.

It was originally spoken in northern Iraq and southeastern Turkey in the lands west of the Great Zab river (Athura). Following the exodus of Jews from the Muslim lands, most speakers now live in Israel, principally Jerusalem and surrounding villages. The name Lishana Deni means 'our language', and is similar to names used by other Jewish Neo-Aramaic dialects (Lishan Didan, Lishanid Noshan). Other popular names for the language are Lishan Hozaye, 'the language of the Jews', and Kurdit, 'Kurdish'. Scholarly sources tend simply to refer to Lishana Deni as Zakho Jewish Neo-Aramaic although it was spoken in the entire region west of the Great Zab river.  Origins  Various Neo-Aramaic dialects were spoken across a wide area from the Zakho region, in the west, to Lake Urmia, in the northeast to Sanandaj, in the southeast (the area covers northern Iraq and northwestern Iran). The upheavals in their traditional region after the First World War and the founding of the State of Israel led most of the Jews of Kurdistan to move to Jerusalem and villages nearby. However, uprooted from northern Iraq, and thrown together with so many different language groups in the fledgling nation, Lishana Deni began to be replaced in the speech of younger generations by Modern Hebrew. Fewer than 8,000 people are known to speak Lishana Deni, and all of them are over 50 years old. Lishana Deni is written in the Hebrew alphabet. Spelling tends to be highly phonetic, and elided letters are not written. Intelligibility The language faces extinction in the next few decades. Although there is very little intelligibility between Lishana Deni and the other Jewish dialects, there is quite reasonable intelligibility between it and the Christian Neo-Aramaic dialects spoken in the region. The Christian dialect of Chaldean Neo-Aramaic is closest to Lishana Deni, followed by the Ashiret dialects of Assyrian Neo-Aramaic. Like other Judaeo-Aramaic dialects, Lishana Deni is sometimes called Targumic, due to the long tradition of translating the Hebrew Bible into Aramaic, and the production of targumim. Region Lishana Deni was spoken in Athura (which means Assyria in NENA dialects), which is located west of the Great Zab river in northern Iraq and southeastern Turkey. Most Lishana Deni speakers are rural and were farmers and shepherds but there are urban speakers as well in cities such as Nohadra, Zakho, Amedya and more. The regions where Lishana Deni was spoken are Bohtan, Zakho and Nineveh Plains in Upper Mesopotamia, as well as Nerwa, Sapna, Barwari and Hakkari mountains.

The dam is named for Yacyret√° Island just upstream, much of which the dam submerged. The word \\"Yacyreta\\" is the Hispanicized spelling of the original Guaran√≠ term Jasyret√¢. The dam is long, and its installed equipment has a maximum power output of , with a record maximum annual power output of achieved in year 2012, and a maximum water flow rate of 55,000 cubic meters per second. Until February 2011, its reservoir was seven meters below its planned water level, only allowing it to operate at 60% capacity. The project generated controversy and criticism during its planning and construction because of the effects it had on local ecology, particularly the flooding of a unique environment causing the extinction in the wild of several species. The financial management of the project also garnered criticism, as it greatly exceeded its original budget, ultimately costing more than $11 billion. In 2014 Paraguay consumed almost 5 percent of its share of Yacyreta‚Äôs production, exporting the rest to Argentina. Geography Yacyreta is located southeast of Asunci√≥n. It is located in the region of a city called Ayolas, downstream from Encarnaci√≥n and away from the rapids of Apip√©. The main dam is near the islands Jasyret√¢ and Talavera. Chronology Generator hall The initial protocol to determine the use of the waterfalls was signed on February 1, 1925 in the United States. However, it was not until January 1958 that the Technical Argentine-Paraguayan Commission was created to undertake technical studies of uses of the river. The studies were presented on December 3, 1973 in Asunci√≥n and the Treaty of Yasyreta was signed; both countries compromised to embark together in the construction. For that the Bi-National Organization Yasyreta was founded. Each state would share jurisdiction and responsibility for executing studies and projects related to the dam. The construction started on December 3, 1983; on April 26, 1989, agreements were signed that defined the definitive plans for the protection of the valleys and streams to the right side of the river (Paraguay). In June of the same year the main branch of the river was closed and on May 19, the other branch, A√±a Ku√°, was also closed. On June 1, 1993 the navigational ship lock was opened, and on September 2, 1994 the first hydroelectric Kaplan turbine began operation. The 20 programmed units functioned for the first time together on July 7, 1998. Construction In addition to the dam, a barrage of materials long closes both arms of the river divided by the island Jasyret√¢; the hydroelectric dam is in part located over this. Both extremes are settled in the Argentine coast, in the locality of Rinc√≥n Santa Mar√≠a and in the Paraguayan coast, near the city of San Cosme y Dami√°n. The artificial lake formed by the dam rises above the original level and covers . Each branch has a slope. The turbines are in the main branch, in a slope with eighteen gates that allow a maximum flow of 55,000 cubic meters per second. The other branch of the river has sixteen more gates with a capacity for another 40,000 cubic meters per second. A ship lock excavated in the basaltic layer allows passage of boats with draft up to 12 feet (3.6 m). A fish ladder, designed after the ecological studies proved that the presence of the dam inhibited the reproduction of certain migratory species of the Paran√° River, especially the dorado and surub√≠, allows fish that swim upstream to cover the 25-meter difference to spawn in the Alto Paran√°. The machine house is 70 meters high. The waterfall, currently 15 meters high, has an average volume of 8,000 cubic meters per second that pass through the turbines and produce energy continuously. For comparison, the falls of Iguaz√∫ are 70 meters high, with a volume of 1,750 cubic meters per second. Population and ecological impact Flood gate for fish The lake created by the dam displaced 40,000 people. The elevation of the water level also affected the road infrastructure and sewage of the region in a way that many studies undertaken prior to construction of the dam did not take into account ; independent research later confirmed that the census of INDEC in 1990 was altered to reduce the amount of money the Yacyreta Organization would have to pay to compensate the people displaced. Ecologically, the construction of the dam most greatly affected the environment of the region in three ways. Firstly, it altered aquatic habitats via the elevation of the water level and the flooding of previously dry areas, which produced chemical changes in the water, including a drop in water oxygen levels. Besides, the alteration of the streams of water affected the dynamics of the floating vegetation that in the system Iber√° is the habitat of many endemic species. The more calm water behind the dam has also allowed the spread of waterborne diseases and disease vectors, such as schistosomiasis, dengue fever and malaria. The structure and composition of the productive activities of the primary sector, that in addition to the direct flooding also modifies the level of humidity of thousand of hectares destined to agriculture and the exploit of wood, thousands of cattle were lost in the process of formation of the lake. Destruction of the habitat submerged by the dam could cause great loss of biodiversity. Numerous protected species have been affected in one of the few spaces in which they survive in Argentina and Paraguay, including pampas deer, capybara, certain water birds and yacare caiman. The consequences for the fish population of Paran√° have been very severe, causing a large drop in the volume of some species, especially when the dam was first constructed. Aquatic invertebrates also declined. For example, among four Aylacostoma aquatic snails restricted to the area, two became extinct, one extinct in the wild, and the final is seriously threatened.Vogler (2013). The Radula of the Extinct Freshwater Snail Aylacostoma stigmatism(Caenofastropoda: Thiaridae) from Argentina and Paraguay. Malacologia 56 (1-2): 329-332.Vogler, Beltramino, Strong & Rumi (2015).

Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society 174(3): 487-499. The construction of the system of elevators helped reduce this effect . Current state Transmission towers Before February 2011, the water level was above sea level, less than planned. This caused the hydroelectric component of the dam to operate at only 60% of its capacity. The water level was raised, bringing it to above sea level and covering another of land surface, affecting more than 50,000 people. This brought the installed capacity to its final design of 3,100 MW and the annual generation to about 20,000 GWh. The plan to finish the Yacyret√° project included: * Freeing the flooded areas, taking into consideration the expropriation of properties, the safety of the freed areas, the relocation of the population and the rehabilitation of the economy. * Doing all the necessary work to reduce negative effects on the natural environment. * Repairing the infrastructure, routes, bridges, ports, airports, electric supply lines, etc. * Repairing the damage to the urban areas of Encarnaci√≥n, Posadas and other cities. Navigation To ease navigation a ship lock was built in the locality of Santa Mar√≠a in the Argentine side. This has a length of 270 meters, and width of 27 meters and a depth of 5 meters, which allows the passage of 12-foot draft boats. Tourism The area has an abundant fauna and there are areas for fishing. Fishing is regulated to protect and maintain fish populations, requiring fishing permits that can be obtained in the regional Office of Fishing. * The Yacyreta Regional Museum is located in Ayolas. It exhibits archaeological objects, minerals and examples of specimens of the native fauna. * The Animal Refuge of Atinguy is located 18 kilometres from Ayolas; its territory is roughly 100 hectares, where a great variety of flora and fauna of the region can be found. * The refuge provides conditions for the animals to live in a natural environment. Even though the hydroelectric power station produces a relatively low amount of contaminants, the Bi-National Organization has set aside areas for the preservation and recuperation of the local flora and fauna, trying to reduce the consequences of the construction. From flooding, 11,000 animals from 110 different species were relocated. Currently, the Organization has a protected area of about 58,000 hectares, with plans for an eventual increase to 187,000 hectares . There is a centre for visitors and a track of 2,500 meters called \\"Akuti po‚Äôi\\" that serves to take guided tours. There are several hotels to stay in when visiting the place, such as the Hotel Nacional de Turismo and the Jasyret√¢ Apart Hotel.

The Tsonga people nicknamed him Skukuza because when he arrived at the area of the reserve he \\"turned everything upside down\\" with the banning of all hunting in the reserve and the relocation of all the native kraals. Skukuza camp and Skukuza Airport is named in honour of Stevenson-Hamilton, who is regarded as a champion of wildlife Conservation in South Africa. Early life and military career James Stevenson-Hamilton was born in Dublin, Ireland on 2 October 1867 to Colonel James Stevenson-Hamilton and Eliza Hamilton. As the eldest of nine children, he was the legal heir to the family title and home at Fairholm, near Larkhall in Scotland. He was educated at Rugby and Sandhurst and opted for a career in the military. He stationed himself briefly on the banks of the Crocodile River in South Africa, familiarising himself with the land and animals, but soon moved and settled at Sabi Bridge, which is now called Skukuza. Following Sandhurst, Stevenson-Hamilton was commissioned into the British Army as a second lieutenant in the 6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons on 14 March 1888,Hart‚Ä≤s Army list, 1903 and saw active service with the Inniskillings in Natal later the same year. (Accessed 8 October 2011) He was promoted to lieutenant on 20 February 1890, and to captain on 1 June 1898, the same year as he joined the Cape-to-Cairo expedition under the leadership of Major Alfred St. Hill Gibbons. After they had \\"Tried to steam up the Zambesi in flat bottomed launches and fought their way well beyond the Kariba Gorge\\", they had to abandon their boats and explore Barotseland on foot. Stevenson- Hamilton then \\"trekked across Northern Rhodesia to the Kafue.\\"Cartwright, A.P. 1960. South Africa's Hall of Fame South Africa: Central News Agency Limited. OCLC: 750076726 After the expedition, he returned to active service, and fought in the Second Boer War (1899-1901), receiving both the Queen's South Africa Medal and the King's South Africa Medal for his service. He also received the brevet rank of major on 29 November 1900 for his service in the war, and after the end of hostilities was promoted to the substantive rank of major on 12 November 1902. History of the Sabi Nature Reserve Stephanus Johannes Paulus Kruger, commonly known as Paul Kruger, was the President of the South African Republic from 1883 to 1902. It was he who first pleaded \\"for setting aside certain areas where game could be protected and where nature could remain unspoilt as the Creator made it\\".Labuschagne, Rudolph Johannes. 1958. 60 Years, Kruger Park. Pretoria: National Park Board of Trustees of the Union of South Africa. His vision, however, was not shared by other members of his parliament; his efforts to conserve land, especially in the areas between Swaziland and Zululand and in the Zoutpansberg area, met with strong opposition. In 1891, Kruger managed to amend existing game laws, and the state started providing protection for some animal species. After managing to declare other smaller areas as game reserves, on 26 March 1898, he proclaimed the 'Goewerments Wildtuin' (Government's Reserve) between the Sabi and Crocodile rivers as the Sabi Nature Reserve. After the end of the Anglo-Boer War (1902) and the death of Paul Kruger (1904), the reserve had almost been forgotten until Lord Milner re-issued the proclamation for the reserve. Stevenson-Hamilton and the Sabi Nature Reserve In June 1902, Sir Godfrey Lagden, the newly appointed Commissioner for Native Affairs in South-Africa, appointed James Stevenson-Hamilton as the first warden of the Sabi Nature Reserve, and he was seconded from the army to service for the British colonial office. As a \\"bachelor, a man of means and a professional soldier,\\" Lagden deemed him fit for the job even though the post was viewed as unusual and unheard of. Stevenson-Hamilton signed a two-year contract as warden, found a map of the area and set off with a wagon, oxen, provisions and ammunition for an uncharted and malaria-filled land described to him as the \\"white man‚Äôs grave\\".Paynter, David, and Nussey, Wilf. 1986. Kruger: Portrait of a National Park. Macmillan South Africa. Game-ranging was still a new term and this allowed Stevenson-Hamilton to have free rein over the Sabi Nature Reserve, his only order from Lagden being \\"to make himself generally disagreeable\\" and to try to eliminate poaching. In 1902, he reached Nelspruit. His first order of business was to announce that no shooting was to be allowed and that if he and his servant could live on tinned meat, so could the white men and natives who were inclined to shoot an impala whenever they felt the need. He believed \\"that if there were no shooting, if animals were left to live in the veld as they had lived before man came on the scene, they would lose their fear of human beings and flock to an area that had once been described as 'red with impala'\\". He then moved his headquarters from Crocodile-Bridge to Sabi-Bridge and appointed two rangers, including Harry Wolhuter, and together they trained native rangers. Poachers soon realised that he was serious about the \\"no shooting\\" rule, and many were caught, \\"Including, on one occasion a party of senior policemen\\"Duggan, A. 1990. Game Parks and Nature Reserves of Southern Africa (2nd edition). Cape Town: The Reader‚Äôs Digest Association. who were caught killing a giraffe and a wildebeest and were convicted and fined for their crimes. After this, \\"what he did is now a matter of history. He trained his rangers, thinned out the lions and the wild dogs, declared war on the poachers and patrolled the whole area.\\" He also became the magistrate, customs collector and border guard, as well as watcher of the railway line to the south of the reserve. His focus then went back to Johannesburg and Pretoria where he started to convince companies in the vicinity to lend him land, eventually giving him a huge block in a remote corner of Transvaal. By doing this, he created the space that is known today as Kruger National Park. Extending the reserve from the original to . In this larger protected area, wildlife could roam freely from the Crocodile River to the Limpopo River. In 1912, he first presented his idea for the nationalization of the reserve to then Minister of Foreign Affairs Jan Smuts. The idea was to transform the reserve into a national park, but to do this he needed \\"the support of the public, but to gain that support visitors should be allowed into the park\\". Unfortunately, World War I temporarily halted these events. In 1926, Piet Grobler established the National Parks Bill in parliament as encouraged by Stevenson-Hamilton and presented Kruger National Park as a realization of the dreams of Paul Kruger. The Sabi Nature Reserve was officially renamed to Kruger National Park of South Africa. In 1927, the park was opened to the public. Later life Stevenson-Hamilton served the game reserve for 44 years from 1902 to 1946. After his retirement on 30 April 1946, he settled in White River. At the age of 63, he married Hilda Chomondeley, 34 years his junior. They had three children: Margaret (born in 1931), James (born in 1933) and Anne (born in 1935). He died on 10 December 1957 at the age of 90. Legacy Stevenson-Hamilton Library Stevenson-Hamilton was a good friend and fellow of the Tsonga people and he was dubbed \\"Skukuza\\" by the Tsonga who lived on the reserve, meaning 'the man who has turned everything upside down' or 'the man who swept clean'. This referred to his efforts to eliminate poaching in the reserve, and according to Henri-Alexandre Junod, also referred to the Tsonga people's attitude toward him after he had evicted them from the southern lowveld. Stevenson-Hamilton understood Tsonga language as well as Tsonga culture and was taught hunting skills by the Tsonga, who were expert in hunting big game, such as Elephants, Rhino, Leopard and Lion. Skukuza, the main camp in the park and which was formerly called Sabi Bridge, was renamed in honour of him. After his death, \\"the old men of the kraals, some of whom he had sent to prison for poaching, said: 'A great man has gone'\\". A bronze statue created by the artist Phil Minnaar can be seen in Skukuza depicting Paul Kruger, Piet Grobler and Stevenson-Hamilton, the founding fathers of the park. The Stevenson-Hamilton library is also situated in Skukuza camp. His legacy also lives on in a books that he authored, namely: *Notes on a Journey Through Portuguese East Africa: From Ibo To Lake Nyasa (1909) *Animal Life in Africa (1912) ‚Äì foreword by Theodore Roosevelt *The Low-Veld: Its Wildlife and Its People (1929) *The Kruger National Park (1932) *South African Eden: From Sabi Game Reserve To Kruger National Park (1937) *Our South African National Parks (1940) *Wild Life in South Africa (1947) *The Barotseland Journal of James Stevenson-Hamilton, 1898-1899 (1953) Stevenson-Hamilton is commemorated in the scientific name of a species of African gecko, Lygodactylus stevensoni.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011).

He joined the Ramakrishna Math in 1897. He became a trustee of Ramakrishna Math and a member of the governing body of Ramakrishna Mission in May 1903. He also took up the editorship of the Bengali magazine called Udbodhan for sometime. He was appointed as the secretary of the math and the mission in 1927 and as the vice president in 1937. In 1938 he became the president of the order. His tenure was short, as he died in 1938. He is renowned in the literary circles to have translated most of Vivekananda's original works from English to Bengali. Pre Monastic Life Shuddhananda's pre-monastic name was Sudhir Chandra Chakravarty. He was born as son of Ashutosh Chakravarty in 1872 in Serpentine Lane in Calcutta. He studied at the City College of the University of Calcutta, prior to joining the Alambazar Math of the Ramakrishna Mission in 1897. He had a group of friends all of whom became directly associated with Ramakrishna order in the later years as monks and all were disciples of Vivekananda. They were Khagen or Vimalananda, Kalikrishna or Virajananda, Haripada or Swami BodhƒÅnanda Puri and Govinda (Shukul) or Swami AtmƒÅnanda Puri. He spent most of his time in spiritual pursuits and reading and discussing religious books in the company of his friends. They also formed a debating club. At this stage Sudhir was interested in the practice of Yoga and learnt it from Panchanan Bhattacharya or Arya Mission, a disciple of Shyamacharan Lahiri or Lahiri Mahasaya. =Introduction to Ramakrishna Order= In 1890 he came in contact with devotees of Ramakrishna at the Baranagar Math and Kankurgachi Yogodyan. Yogananda was the spiritual mentor of the group. Advaitananda provided him with a copy of the Teachings of Sri Ramakrishna, a small book compiled by Sureshchandra Dutta, a householder devotee of Ramakrishna. =Introduction to Vivekananda and his teachings= Sudhir, like other youths of his time in India, was greatly inspired by the stirring lectures of Vivekananda in the Parliament of World Religions, 1893 and elsewhere in the West. He closely followed the lectures published in Indian Mirror Newspaper and became attracted to the ideals of Vivekananda. Sudhir also went to Sealdah Station to meet Vivekananda the day he set foot in Calcutta and also went to meet him in the house of Pashupati Bose, accompanied by his friend Khagen (later Vimalananda). He also frequented the house of Gopal Lal Seal where the swami was put up, to hear his conversations. In one of the rooms of the garden house he talked directly to Vivekananda for the first time. Once in a meeting Sudhir read out from Kathopanishad and Vivekananda interpreted the verses to an assembled crowd. Monastic Life and contributions =Initiation and service= Sudhir joined in Alambazar Math in April 1897. Vivekananda would call Sudhir affectionately as Khoka (small boy). Sudhir was initiated by Vivekananda into monastic vows (sannyasa) in May 1897 and was named as Shuddhananda (Shuddha: pure). His brother was Prakashananda (called Sushil Maharaj), who also served the Ramakrishna Order as a monk and was also a direct disciple of Vivekananda. In April 1897 when Vivekananda was laying down the guidelines for the future monastic order only Shuddhananda volunteered to take his dictation. He was asked to put all rules in a positive form. He was also asked on one occasion to deliver a lecture on Atman in English before an assembled crowd. Swami Vivekananda himself asked Swami Shuddhananda to translate his Raja Yoga into Bengali. later he translated many other works of swami Vivekananda including Karma Yoga, Jnana Yoga and Bhakti Yoga. He also captured the lecture of Vivekananda on the Gita from his memory and wrote Gita Tattva in Bengali. Following Vivekananda's instructions he is known to have written an independent commentary on the Brahma Sutras. Vivekananda had also asked Shuddhananda to maintain a diary of the Math and prepare weekly report of its activities. His diary is a historical account of the steady development of the Ramakrishna Order. He also wrote many of the personal letters of his master. From it is also known many incidents related to the life of Vivekananda in the monastery. On 6 May 1897, Shuddhananda accompanied Vivekananda on his lecture tour in northern and western India. during this trip he was with his master for six months. This close association familiarized Shuddhananda with his ideas regarding the past, present and future of Ramakrishna Order, the essence of the scriptures and the problems being faced by the society. =In company of the other direct disciples of Ramakrishna= Before taking monastic vows Shuddhananda had spent many days in Almora practising spiritual disciplines under Swami NiranjanƒÅnanda Puri, a direct monastic disciple of Ramakrishna. In September 1898 they came to Varanasi and stayed in the garden house of Banshi Dutta. However the austerities took a toll on the health of Shuddhananda. At this point Charuchandra, later Shubhananda, and Kedarnath, later Achalananda served and nursed him back to health. Shuddhananda mentioned more than once that Niranjanananda's influence had contributed greatly to his spiritual progress. He was also intimate with Ramakrishnananda. Later, at the behest of Vivekananda, Shuddhananda worked as an assistant to Trigunatitananda, who was the editor of Udbodhan, the Bengali magazine of the Ramakrishna Order. =Meeting Bhaskarananda= While staying in Varanasi, Shuddhananda had the opportunity of meeting Bhaskarananda, who was famous as a saint of Varanasi. Bhaskarananda had pleaded with him to help him in meeting Vivekananda. =Character= Spiritual practices and selfless service formed the backbone of his monastic life. He would conduct scriptural classes for the monastic inmates despite his busy schedule. He established a study circle in Belur Math to enable brother monks to learn the essence of the scriptures. He always mixed freely with the junior monks and addressed them as brother senior monks used to call him as \\"book of reference\\" on scriptures. He looked upon the activities of the Ramakrishna Order as the worship of the divinity in the form of the Holy Trio. He inspired other monastic organizations to follow a life of purity dedicated to God based on mutual love and affection among monastic inmates. He did not like any special arrangement to be made for him and stopped the authorities from doing the same towards the end of his life. =Quotes= *\\"The purpose behind every work that Mission undertakes is to reveal Sri Ramakrishna's glory. Seeing our work people should be attracted not to us but to Sri Ramakrishna and Swamiji. Revealing their glory is the purpose of our lives, the purpose of Ramakrishna Mission.\\" *\\"She (Sarada Devi) is indeed a mother in every sense of the word, the Mother of the Universe. Such tolerance, such greatness and such spiritual power can be combined only in the Mother of the Universe. There was no end to her compassion and her love knew no discrimination.\\" * \\"The struggle between the internal forces of a man and his environment is what is meant by spiritual practice. Hence for progress in spiritual life there are two distinct courses. One is to tear oneself away from the natural environment and find a more congenial one, while the second is to remain in the same environment and try to overcome one's innate tendencies by waging a constant war against them and thereby becoming spiritually strong\\". =Contributions, honorariums and legacy= Swami Shuddhananda served as the in charge of the first students' boarding house in Belur Math. Editor of Udbodhan When Trigunatita left for the Americas in 1902, Shuddhananda was asked to take the editorship of Udbodhan by Saradananda and Brahmananda. For the next ten years Shuddhananda managed the affairs of Udbodhan. He focussed on translating and publishing in Bengali Vivekananda's speeches and writings. Under his new role the Udbodhan magazine got many pioneering writings like the Sri Ramakrishna, the Great Master or Sri sri Ramakrishna Leela Prasanga by Saradananda and the Bengali version of The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna or Sri Ramakrishna Kathamrita by Mahendranath Gupta. Trustee of Belur Math In 1903 Shuddhananda was appointed one of the trustees of the Belur Math. Apart from his usual organizational activities he was actively involved in instilling and infusing the ideals of his master among the youth. He led the effort of setting up a Vivekananda Society in Calcutta to spread the ideas and ideals and would contribute actively to the cause. He organized study circles and joined discussions on Vedanta among youth. He also encouraged his brother disciple Swami Virajananda to publish the Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda. Shuddhananda was also responsible for planning and organizing the historic first Monk's Conference of Ramakrishna Order in Belur Math. The report of the convention says, it was only through the unbounded enthusiasm and unremitting labour of swami Shuddhananda that the convention materialized. Secretary of Belur Math Shuddhananda was appointed as the Secretary in 1927 after the death of Saradananda. He occupied this post till 1934, except for a short spell from 1930 to 1931 when he had to take rest on account of ill health. Ramakrishna Centenary, 1936-1937 Shuddhananda was nominated as the president of the celebration committee for the birth centenary celebration of Ramakrishna in 1936. The centenary celebration included a Parliament of Religions in Calcutta, which was chaired by among other dignitaries, Rabindranath Tagore. Vice President and President of the Ramakrishna Order In February 1937 Shuddhananda was elected as the Vice President of the Ramakrishna Order. In May 1938, he was elected as the President after the demise of Vijnanananda. He was the fifth president of the order. He occupied the position till his death in October 1938. =Literary accomplishments= He is renowned in literary and cultural circles as the translator of most of Vivekananda's works into Bengali, and as the best exponent of his thoughts and ideals. His translations played a major role in spreading Vivekananda's ideas in Bengal. He along with Saradananda edited Sri Sri Mayer Katha, which was subsequently translated into English under the title The Gospel of Holy Mother. He succeeded Saradananda as the General Secretary of Order in 1927. He became the president of the Ramakrishna Mission after the death of Vijnanananda in 1938 and continued in this position till his death. He also encouraged Arupanananda to pen his reminiscences of Sarada Devi (called the \\"Holy Mother\\") and worked with him in compiling and editing the book. Final Days Shuddhananda suffered from ill health owing to the spiritual practices and hard work. In 1934 he spent sometimes in Shyamala Tal on being invited by Virajananda, a brother disciple. He also came to Kankhal in 1935 to spend sometime in solitude with another brother disciple, Swami Kalyanananda. In 1937 he suffered a mild paralytic stroke and recovered from the same. His health deteriorated from 18 October 1938. He died on 23 October 1938 at the age of 66.

The engagement was inconclusive, and is most notable for the sinking of the English carrack, Mary Rose. Prelude In 1545, France launched an invasion of England with 30,000 soldiers in more than 200 ships. Against this armada‚Äîlarger than the Spanish Armada 43 years later‚Äîthe English had about 12,000 soldiers and 80 ships. The French expedition started disastrously, the flagship Carraquon being destroyed on 6July in an accidental fire whilst at anchor in the Seine. Admiral Claude d'Annebault transferred his flag to La Maistresse, which then ran aground as the fleet set sail. The leaks were patched up and the fleet crossed the Channel. The French entered the Solent and landed troops on the Isle of Wight. Battle On 18 July, the English came out of Portsmouth and engaged the French at long range, little damage being done on either side. La Maitresse was close to sinking due to her earlier damage but, although d'Annebault had to change his flagship again, she was saved. On the night of 18 July, Henry dined aboard Great Harry, the flagship of Admiral John Dudley, Viscount Lisle. The next day was calm, and the French employed their galleys against the immobile English vessels. Toward evening, a breeze sprang up and, as Mary Rose, the flagship of Vice Admiral George Carew, advanced, she foundered and sank with the loss of all but 35‚Äì40 of her crew. The precise reasons are not known, but it was believed at the time that the crew had forgotten to close the lower gunports after firing, so that when she heeled over in the breeze she took on water and sank. A witness with the French fleet believed that the galleys had sunk her, although this is not supported by other contemporary accounts and no physical evidence of this remains.Stirland (2000), pp. 22‚Äì23. The wind subsequently died down but Lisle made use of the tides and currents to position his fleet and disrupt the formation of the larger French ships. Aftermath The invasion of the Isle of Wight was repulsed. The attacking troops attempted to divide the defence by landing at several sites but did not venture inland or regroup. There were heavy casualties on both sides at the Battle of Bonchurch, the French at Sandown hastily retreated after losing their commanders in an attack on a newly built fort, and those that landed at Bembridge were ambushed. On 22 July, unable to resupply, and struggling with a leaking ship and illness among his crew, d'Annebault abandoned the invasion. He recalled the French troops and his fleet departed. The next day, the French landed 1,500 troops near the town of Seaford, around to the east. They attempted to pillage a nearby village but were repelled by local militia armed with longbows. D‚ÄôAnnebault then returned to France.  Citations   General references  * Loaves, David, The Tudor Navy: An administrative, political and military history.

Retrolistheses are most easily diagnosed on lateral x-ray views of the spine. Views where care has been taken to expose for a true lateral view without any rotation offer the best diagnostic quality. Retrolistheses are found most prominently in the cervical spine and lumbar region but can also be seen in the thoracic area. Classification  Retrolisthesis can be classified as a form of spondylolisthesis, since spondylolisthesis is often defined in the literature as displacement in any direction.Introduction to chapter 17 in: Page 250 in: Yet, medical dictionaries usually define spondylolisthesis specifically as the forward or anterior displacement of a vertebra over the vertebra inferior to it (or the sacrum)., in turn citing: *Miller-Keane Encyclopedia and Dictionary of Medicine, Nursing, and Allied Health, Seventh Edition.

Copyright date 2005 Retrolisthesis is also called retrospondylolisthesis.  Signs and symptoms  Retrolisthesis may lead to symptoms of greatly varying intensity and distribution. This is because of the variable nature of the impact on nerve tissue and of the mechanical impact on the spinal joints themselves. Structural instability may be experienced as a local uneasiness through to a more far reaching structural compensatory distortion involving the whole spine. If the joints are stuck in a retrolisthesis configuration there may also be changes to range of motion. Pain may be experienced as a result of irritation to the sensory nerve roots by bone depending on the degree of displacement and the presence of any rotatory positioning of the individual spinal motion segments. The soft tissue of the disc is often caused to bulge in retrolistheses. These cannot be determined by plain films, as the x-ray passes through the soft tissue. A study by Giles et al., stated that sixteen of the thirty patients (53%) had retrolisthesis of L5 on S1 ranging from 2‚Äì9 mm; these patients had either intervertebral disc bulging or protrusion on CT examination ranging from 3‚Äì7 mm into the spinal canal. Fourteen patients (47%) without retrolisthesis (control group) did not show any retrolisthesis and the CT did not show any bulge/protrusion. On categorizing x-ray and CT pathology as being present or not, the well positioned i.e. true lateral plain x-ray film revealed a sensitivity and specificity of 100% ([95% Confidence Interval. = [89%‚Äì100%]) for bulge/protrusion in this preliminary study.‚Äù (7) Spinal cord compressions are also possible with patients experiencing pain, rigidity and neurologic signs that may follow some distance along nerves to cause symptoms at some distance from the location of the retrolisthesis. Diagnosis Retrolisthesis of L5-S1 Complete Retrolisthesis - The body of one vertebra is posterior to both the vertebral body of the segment of the spine above as well as below. Stairstepped Retrolisthesis - The body of one vertebra is posterior to the body of the spinal segment above, but is anterior to the one below. Partial Retrolisthesis - The body of one vertebra is posterior to the body of the spinal segment either above or below. (3) = Grading = Since the vertebral body in a retrolisthesis moves in a posterior direction, the grading used for spondylolistheses is of little use. It is however useful to divide the anterior to posterior dimension of the intervertebral foramina (IVF) (4) into four equal units. A posterior displacement of up to ¬º of the IVF is graded as Grade 1, ¬º to ¬Ω as Grade 2, ¬Ω to ¬æ as Grade 3, ¬æ to total occlusion of the IVF as Grade 4. Alternatively, a measurement of the amount of displacement can also made by measuring the bone displacement in millimetres. Retrolistheses can be caused by injury and the resulting instability of the connecting soft tissues especially ligaments, discs, muscles, tendons and fascia. They may also involve muscles through spasm as a result of nerve malfunction due to pressure caused by the posterior displacement of the vertebra encroaching on the contents of the IVF. The IVF's contents include spinal (sensory and motor) nerves, arteries, veins and lymphatic vessels which cater to the nutritional and waste removal needs of the spinal cord. Degenerative spinal changes are often seen at the levels where a retrolisthesis is found. These changes are more pronounced as time progresses after injury, and are evidenced by end plate osteophytosis, disc damage, disc narrowing, desiccation and disc bulging. ‚ÄúA retrolisthesis hyperloads at least one disc and puts shearing forces on the anterior longitudinal ligament, the annular rings, nucleus pulposus, cartilage end plates and capsular ligaments. The bulging, twisting and straining tissues attached to the endplates pull, push and stretch it. It is worsened with time, becoming irreversible.‚Äù This is the etiology of degenerative joint disease. (5) Associated radiological findings include a vacuum phenomenon (in the nucleus pulposis of the adjacent intervertebral disc), reduction of disc height with corresponding loss of the disc space, marginal sclerosis of the adjacent vertebral bodies, osteophyte formation and apophyseal joint instability. With a retrolisthesis there is always a less than ideal positioning of spinal segments. There is also always a reduced anterior to posterior dimension of the spinal canal compared to the way it is supposed to be. The greater the posterior displacement, the more significant it is for producing a dysfunctional spinal cord or even a cauda equina syndrome. = Joint stability = Joint stability is easily evaluated by the use of flexion and extension lateral x-ray views of the spine. A summary of part of the DRE tables (6) give a guide as to the implications of the joint instability. If either translation or angular change is determined from flexion to extension to the degree shown in the table below, then Category IV instability is present. See also Joint stability. Translation is a gliding motion where one bone of a joint glides over its neighbour. Management  References  :6. Hadley, Lee A.

Spondylolisthesis is classified as one of the six major etiologies: degenerative, traumatic, dysplastic, isthmic, pathologic, or post-surgical. Spondylolisthesis most commonly occurs in the lumbar spine, primarily at the L5-S1 level with the L5 vertebral body anteriorly translating over the S1 vertebral body. Types Olisthesis (synonym olisthy) is a term that more explicitly denotes displacement in any direction. Forward or anterior displacement can specifically be called anterolisthesis. Anterolisthesis commonly involves the fifth lumbar vertebra. Backward displacement is called retrolisthesis. Lateral displacement is called lateral listhesis or laterolisthesis. A hangman's fracture is a specific type of spondylolisthesis where the second cervical vertebra (C2) is displaced anteriorly relative to the C3 vertebra due to fractures of the C2 vertebra's pedicles. Anterolisthesis =Classification= Anterolisthesis can be categorized by cause, location and severity. By causes * Degenerative anterolisthesis (a.k.a. type 3) is a disease of the older adult that develops as a result of facet arthritis and joint remodeling. Joint arthritis, and ligamentum flavum weakness, may result in slippage of a vertebra. Degenerative forms are more likely to occur in women, persons older than fifty, and African Americans. * Traumatic anterolisthesis is rare and results from acute fractures in the neural arch, other than the pars. * Dysplastic anterolisthesis (a.k.a. type 1) results from congenital abnormalities of the upper sacral facets or inferior facets of the fifth lumbar vertebra, and accounts for 14% to 21% of all anterolisthesis. * Isthmic anterolisthesis (a.k.a. type 2) is caused by a defect in the pars interarticularis but it can also be seen with an elongated pars. * Pathologic anterolisthesis (a.k.a. type 5) is caused by either infection or a malignancy. * Post-surgical/iatrogenic anterolisthesis (a.k.a. type 6) is caused by complications after surgery. By location Anterolisthesis location includes which vertebrae are involved, and may also specify which parts of the vertebrae are affected. Isthmic anterolisthesis is where there is a defect in the pars interarticularis. It is the most common form of spondylolisthesis; also called spondylolytic spondylolisthesis, it occurs with a reported prevalence of 5‚Äì7 percent in the US population. A slip or fracture of the intravertebral joint is usually acquired between the ages of 6 and 16 years, but remains unnoticed until adulthood. Roughly 90 percent of these isthmic slips are low-grade (less than 50 percent slip) and 10 percent are high-grade (greater than 50 percent slip). It is divided into three subtypes: ** A: pars fatigue fracture ** B: pars elongation due to multiple healed stress effects ** C: pars acute fracture Severity Classification by degree of the slippage, as measured as percentage of the width of the vertebral body: Grade I spondylolisthesis accounts for approximately 75% of all cases. *Grade I: 0‚Äì25% *Grade II: 25- 50% *Grade III: 50‚Äì75% *Grade IV: 75‚Äì100% *Grade V: greater than 100% Spondylolisthesis measurement on X-ray.pngX-ray of measurement of spondylolisthesis at the lumbosacral joint, being 25% in this example.

Blue arrow normal pars interarticularis. Red arrow is a break in pars interarticularis SpondyloL5S1Mark.pngAnterolisthesis L5/S1 =Signs and symptoms= Symptoms of lumbar anterolisthesis include: * A general stiffening of the back and a tightening of the hamstrings, with a resulting change in both posture and gait. * A leaning-forward or semi-kyphotic posture may be seen, due to compensatory changes. * A \\"waddle\\" may be seen in more advanced causes, due to compensatory pelvic rotation due to decreased lumbar spine rotation. * A result of the change in gait is often a noticeable atrophy in the gluteal muscles due to lack of use. * Generalized lower-back pain may also be seen, with intermittent shooting pain from the buttocks to the posterior thigh, and/or lower leg via the sciatic nerve. Other symptoms may include tingling and numbness. Coughing and sneezing can intensify the pain. An individual may also note a \\"slipping sensation\\" when moving into an upright position. Sitting and trying to stand up may be painful and difficult. = Physical Exam = The major components of the physical exam for spondylolisthesis consists of observation, palpation, and maneuvers. The most common finding is pain with lumbar extension. The following physical involves specific assessment for spondylolisthesis. However, a general examination, most importantly neurological examination, must be done to rule out alternative causes for signs and symptoms. Neurological examination is often normal in patients with spondylolisthesis, but lumbosacral radiculopathy is commonly seen in patients with degenerate spondylolisthesis.  Observation  The patient should be observed walking and standing. Most patients present with a normal gait. An abnormal gait is often the sign of a high grade case. A patient with high grade spondylolisthesis may present with a posterior pelvic tilt causing a loss in the normal contour of the buttocks. An antalgic gait, rounded back and decreased hip extension, can result from severe pain. While standing, the patient should be observed from the front, back, and signs. Increased and decreased lumbar lordosis, inward curvature of the lower spine, has been seen.  Palpation  Detection of spondylolisthesis by palpation is most often done by palpating for the spinous process. Each level of the lumbar spine should be palpated. Spinous process palpation by itself is not a definitive method for the detection of spondylolisthesis.  Maneuvers  * Spinal range of motion testing ‚Äì Range of motion limitations may be seen. * Lumbar hyperextension ‚Äì Extension often elicits pain. This can be assessed by having the patient hyperextend the lumbar spine, provide resistance against back extensions, or undergo repeated lumbar extensions. *Sport-specific motion ‚Äì Patient can be asked to repeat aggravating movements that they experience during their activity. During the movement, ask patient to point to any places with focal pain. *Straight leg raise ‚Äì Maneuver used to assess for hamstring tightness. The straight leg raise has been found to be positive in only 10% of patients with spondylolisthesis. *Muscle strength exercises ‚Äì Lower abdominal, gluteal, and lumbar extensors should be assessed for weakness. Weakness in these muscles can increase lordosis and contribute to sacroiliac instability. Abdominal flexor strength can be assessed with the abdominal flexor endurance test. The test involves the patient lying supine while holding a 45 degree flexed trunk and 90 degree flexed knees for 30 seconds. Gluteal strength can be assessed with a single leg squat. Lastly, lumbar extension can be assessed with a single leg bridge. * = Diagnostic Imaging = In adults with non- specific low back pain, strong evidence suggests medical imaging should not be done within the first six weeks. It is also suggested to avoid advanced imaging, such as CT or MRI, for adults without neurological symptoms or \\"red flags\\" in the patient's history. General recommendations for initial low back pain treatment is remaining active, avoiding twisting and bending, avoiding activities that worsen pain, avoiding bed rest, and possibly initiating a trial of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs after consulting a physician. Children and adolescents with persistent low back pain may require earlier imaging and should be seen by physician. Once imaging is deemed necessary, a combination of plain radiography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging may be used. Images are most often taken of the lumbar spine due to spondylolisthesis most commonly involving the lumbar region. Images of the thoracic spine can be taken if a patient's history and physical suggest thoracic involvement.  Plain Radiography (X-Ray)  Plain radiography is often the first step in medical imaging. Anteroposterior (front-back) and lateral (side) images are used to allow the physician to view the spine at multiple angles. Oblique view are no longer recommended. In evaluating for spondylolithesis, plain radiographs provide information on the positioning and structural integrity of the spine. Therefore, if further detail is needed a physician may request advanced imaging.  Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)  Magnetic resonance imaging is the preferred advanced imaging technique for evaluation of spondylolisthesis. Preference is due to effectiveness, lack of radiation exposure, and ability to evaluate for soft tissue abnormalities and spinal canal involvement. MRI is limited in its ability to evaluate fractures in great detail, compared to other advanced imaging modalities.  Computed Tomography (CT)  Computed tomography can be helpful in evaluating bony vertebral abnormalities, such as fractures. This can be helpful in determining if the fracture is a new, old, and/or progressing fracture. CT use in spondylolisthesis evaluation is controversial due to high radiation exposure. = Treatment = Spondylolisthesis patients without symptoms do not need to be treated.  Conservative Non-operative management, also referred to as conservative treatment, is the recommended treatment for spondylolisthesis in most cases with or without neurological symptoms. Most patients with spondylolisthesis respond to conservative treatment. Conservative treatment consists primarily of physical therapy, intermittent bracing, aerobic exercise, pharmacological intervention, and epidural steroid injections. The majority of patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis do not require surgical intervention. * Physical therapy can evaluate and address postural and compensatory movement abnormalities.Treatment Options for Spondylolisthesis; OrthoConsult Physical therapy primarily includes spinal flexion and extension exercises with a focus on core stabilization and muscle strengthening. In particular, lumbar spondylolisthesis may benefit from core stabilization exercises focusing on lower abdominal, lumbar muscles, hamstrings, and hip flexors, which may temporarily or permanently improve symptoms and improve general function. *Some patients may benefit from bracing in combination with physical therapy. Additionally, bracing was found to be beneficial when performed immediately following the onset of symptoms, in particular patients with lumbar pars interarticular defects. *Exercises such as cycling, elliptical training, swimming, and walking are considered low- impact aerobic exercises and are recommended for pain relief. * Anti- inflammatory medications (NSAIDS) in combination with paracetamol (Tylenol) can be tried initially. If a severe radicular component is present, a short course of oral steroids such as prednisone or methylprednisolone can be considered. Epidural steroid injections, either interlaminal or transforaminal, performed under fluoroscopic guidance can help with severe radicular (leg) pain, but lacks conclusive benefit in relieving back pain in lumbar spondylolisthesis.  Surgical  There are no clear radiological or medical guidelines or indications for surgical interventions in degenerative spondylolisthesis. A minimum of three months of conservative management should be completed prior to considering surgical intervention. Three indications for potential surgical treatment are as follows: persistent or recurrent back pain or neurologic pain with a persistent reduction of quality of life despite a reasonable trial of conservative (non-operative) management, new or worsening bladder or bowel symptoms, or a new or worsening neurological deficit.fusion and placement of an interbody graft between L5 and S1. Both minimally invasive and open surgical techniques are used to treat anterolisthesis. Retrolisthesis Grade 1 retrolistheses of C3 on C4 and C4 on C5 A retrolisthesis is a posterior displacement of one vertebral body with respect to the subjacent vertebra to a degree less than a luxation (dislocation). Retrolistheses are most easily diagnosed on lateral x-ray views of the spine. Views, where care has been taken to expose for a true lateral view without any rotation, offer the best diagnostic quality. Retrolistheses are found most prominently in the cervical spine and lumbar region but can also be seen in the thoracic area. History Spondylolisthesis was first described in 1782 by Belgian obstetrician Herbinaux. He reported a bony prominence anterior to the sacrum that obstructed the vagina of a small number of patients.

Born as the son of Trailokyanath Bose and Nishadkalidevi, Virajananda was the first person to join the Ramakrishna Order after the direct disciples of Ramakrishna. In 1897, he was initiated into sannyasa by Vivekananda. from 1899 onward he served in Advaita Ashrama, Mayavati and became its president in 1906. He is recognised as a monastic disciple of Vivekananda. Along with Swarupananda, Virajananda played a great role in popularising the monthly magazine of the order, Prabuddha Bharata. He was also responsible for successful completion of compilation and publishing of The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda. He then edited and published a biography of Vivekananda in 1906 under the title The Life of Swami Vivekananda by his Eastern and Western Disciples. He was appointed the president of the Advaita Ashrama at Mayavati in 1913. In 1924 he became the General Secretary of the Ramakrishna Order. In 1938, he became the 6th President of the Ramakrishna Mission. He was the main source of inspiration behind the founding of two educational institutes of that mission known as Vidyamandir and Sarada Pith. Pre-monastic life Kalikrishna, as he was called in his pre-monastic life, was born on 10 June 1873 to Trailokyanath Bose and Nishadkali Devi on the Hindu festival day of bathing festival (snan yatra) of Jagannath. He had his early education from Hembabu's training academy and passed his matriculation from Ripon School in 1890. He was adept in extra curricular activities like handicrafts, fine arts, cooking and gardening from an early age. He was inspired by his friend Khagendranath, later Vimalananda, a disciple of Vivekananda, to lead a spiritual life. He also had a group of young friends who later became renunciates and who also joined the Ramakrishna order. Among them were Sudhir Chandra Chakravarty (Swami Shuddhananda), Sushil Chandra Chakravarty (Swami Prakashananda), Govinda Shukul (Swami Atmananda) and Haripada Chatterjee (Swami Bodhananda). Kalikrishna joined Ripon college and came in contact with Ram Chandra Datta, one of the foremost householder disciples of Ramakrishna, and the founder of Kankurgachi Yogodyan. He was also intimate with Mahendranath Gupta or M and another prominent householder disciple of Ramakrishna, who was at that time a professor of English at Ripon college. M inspired him to visit Baranagar Math and meet the direct monastic disciples of Ramakrishna. After spending many days there in company of the monks, Kalikrishna renounced his worldly life and joined the Baranagar Math as an inmate. He served all the prominent monastic disciples like Ramakrishnananda, Niranjananda and Saradananda. He also went on a pilgrimage to Bodhgaya. He went to Jayrambati to attend the Jagaddhatri Puja conducted by Sarada Devi's family, along with Saradananda. In 1892, the monastery of the Ramakrishna Order was shifted to Alambazar and was called Alambazar Math. There Kalikrishna got an opportunity to meet and serve Gopaler Ma, a woman disciple of Ramakrishna. Under instruction from Sarada Devi he went back home and stayed with his family to recuperate from a broken health and there he followed an intense spiritual routine. In 1895, he went to Benaras and Vrindavan for performing spiritual austerities and stayed with direct monastic disciples of Ramakrishna like Brahmananda, Baburam Maharaj, Advaitananda and Yogananda. He also stayed in the house of Hariprasanna Chatterjee, later Vijnanananda to recoup his health. However all this time he was greatly inspired by Vivekananda and his exploits in the West and was awaiting his return. In 1897 he reached Calcutta and met Vivekananda. Within a few days of their first meeting, Vivekananda granted sannyas to Kalikrishna who was renamed as Virajananda (Vi-rajas, without stain). Monastic life and contributions Virajananda went to Deoghar for famine relief activities but he was largely involved in serving Vivekananda. He went to dhaka together with Prakashananda. In Barisal he met Ashwini Kumar Dutta, the great philosopher, nationalist leader, educationist and freedom fighter, and in Deobhog he met Durga Charan Nag, popularly called Nag Mahasaya, the direct householder disciple of sri Ramakrishna. After returning from East Bengal, Virajananda was entrusted to serve Vivekananda as a personal attendant. When Vivekananda went to West for a second time, Virajananda was sent to Mayavati to work for Prabuddha Bharata or Awakened India, together with Swami Swarupananda. When Vivekananda visited Mayavati in December 1900 to January 1901, Virajananda made all arrangements for his travel and personal comfort. In 1901 Virajananda went for a pilgrimage to Kedarnath and Badrinath. After returning from the pilgrimage he started working on popularising Prabuddha Bharata in Northern and Western India. He also visited the Ramakrishna Mission Sevashrama Kankhal and stayed with his brother disciple Swami Kalyanananda. During his canvassing tour he received the news of his master's demise and returned to Mayavati. He immersed himself in spiritual pursuits like meditation and austerities and his health broke down. At this stage he received instructions on spiritual practices from the Sarada Devi in Jayrambati and returned to Belur Math. He became a personal attendant to Brahmananda, the then President of the Ramakrishna Order. From 1906 to 1913 Virajananda was the president of the Advaita Ashrama at Mayavati. Under his stewardship the ashrama got over the financial difficulties that it was in and the circulation of Prabuddha Bharata also increased. He also took up the task of compiling the Complete works of Swami Vivekananda in five volumes. He also worked on editing the Life of Swami Vivekananda, by his Eastern and Western disciples, the first such comprehensive biography. On this work he was congratulated by Akhandananda, Saradananda, Abhedananda and his brother disciple Shuddhananda. He was also appointed as a trustee of Ramakrishna Math and a member of the governing body of Ramakrishna Mission in 1906. In 1913 he set up a retreat in the Himalayan foothills and named the place as Shyamala Tal. He set up the Vivekananda Ashrama there. Here he continued his spiritual practices and also worked on the biography of Vivekananda. He also established the Ramakrishna Home of Service here. He also served as the secretary of the organising committee of the first convention of the monks of the Ramakrishna order in 1926 in Belur Math. He helped the Ramakrishna Order to tide over a major crisis in 1929 and temporarily took charge of Ramakrishna Math at Baghbazar (Mother's House or Udbodhan House) and Sister Nivedita Girls' School. He served as a secretary of the Ramakrishna Order for a year in 1930 and was again appointed Secretary in 1934. During his secretaryship he helped in organising the Sri Ramakrishna Birth Centenary Celebration and the Parliament of world Religions in Calcutta in 1937. He was elected as the Vice-President of the Ramakrishna order in 1938 and was also elected as the President in December 1938 when his brother disciple Shuddhananda died in October 1938. He used to call himself the Chief Monastic Servant of the order. He dreamt of a Vivekananda University and was the inspiration behind the founding of the two educational institutions in Belur Math, Belur Vidyamandir and Sarada Pitha. The foundation for the first college of Ramakrishna Mission was laid on 31 January 1940 under his guidance. Even after becoming president of the order he would spend a few months every year in Shyamal Tal in the Himalayas. Last year of his life was spent at Belur Math. Last years After assuming the responsibility of the Presidency, he suffered from heart and liver problems, and various ailments of old age. He attained Mahasamadhi on 30 May 1951. Legacy Gambhirananda, in his book History of Ramakrishna Math and Mission writes that Virajananda, besides having his spiritual training at the feet of Sarada Devi, had served Vivekananda personally and had long served in the Ramakrishna Math and Mission in various capacities. All these qualifications marked him out as an outstanding personality in the Ramakrishna Order. He proved to the most successful president who lived long enough to guide the organisation, all its members, as well as the lay devotees whom he initiated. During his tenure India marked famines, the Second World War, political instability and the partition of India, which also adversely affected the Ramakrishna Math and Mission.

It was first described by Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus in 1758. It stands up to merely at the shoulder and weighs . A characteristic feature is the long and slender legs, with the hindlegs twice as long as the forelegs. Horns are possessed only by males; the short, smooth, spiky horns measure and bend backward. The soft coat is reddish to golden brown, in sharp contrast with the white ventral parts. In comparison to Bates's pygmy antelope, the royal antelope has a longer muzzle, broader lips, a smaller mouth and smaller cheek muscles. Typically nocturnal (active at night), the royal antelope exhibits remarkable alertness. Territories are marked with dung. A herbivore, the royal antelope prefers small quantities of fresh foliage and shoots; fruits and fungi may be taken occasionally. Like other neotragines, the royal antelope is monogamous. Both sexes can become sexually mature by as early as six months. Births have been reported in November and December. A single, delicate young is born after an unknown gestational period. The royal antelope prefers areas with fresh and dense growth of shrubs and other plants. It inhabits the warm, moist lowland forests prevalent in western African countries such as C√¥te d'Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The royal antelope has been categorised as Least Concern by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN). The populations are feared to be declining due to habitat deterioration and expanding human settlement. A significant threat to the survival of this antelope is hunting for bushmeat. Taxonomy and etymology The scientific name of the royal antelope is Neotragus pygmaeus. It is placed in the genus Neotragus and the family Bovidae. It was first described by Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae (1758). German zoologist Peter Simon Pallas recognised two species ‚Äì Tragulus pygmaeus and Antilope pygmaea. However, both of them were found to have the same type, the royal antelope. Hence these were treated as synonyms for N. pygmaeus. The generic name Neotragus is constituted by two Greek words: neo (\\"new\\") and tragus (\\"he-goat\\"), while the specific name pygmaeus comes from the Greek pugmaios (\\"as small as a fist\\", in reference to the diminutive size of the antelope). The vernacular name \\"royal antelope\\" is based on a statement made by Willem Bosman, a merchant associated with the Dutch West India Company, that the antelope was called \\"the king of the harts\\" (\\"hart\\" means \\"deer\\" in Old English) by locals. The tribe Neotragini comprises a variety of dwarf antelopes apart from Neotragus ‚Äì these include Dorcatragus (beira), Ourebia (oribi), Madoqua (dik dik), Oreotragus (klipspringer) and Raphicerus. The tribe has been shown to be paraphyletic. A 2014 phylogenetic analysis based on cytochrome b sequences and linear skull measurements showed polyphyly in Neotragus. The royal antelope is not closely related to the other two species in its genus ‚Äì suni (N. moschatus) and Bates's pygmy antelope (N. batesi). The latter two are closely related, while the royal antelope is likely to have had an ancestor in common with the klipspringer and duikers (subfamily Cephalophinae). Description An illustration of the royal antelope from The Book of Antelopes (1894) The royal antelope is the smallest antelope and ruminant in the world. It is also the smallest African ungulate, followed by Bates's pygmy antelope; The royal antelope reaches merely at the shoulder and weighs . The head-and-body length is typically . A characteristic feature is the long and slender legs, with the hindlegs twice as long as the forelegs ‚Äì a remarkable similarity to the hare. The thin tail, long, is white on the underside, ending in a white tuft. The species is sexually dimorphic, with females being larger than males. Only males possess horns, these being short, smooth, ventrally reflexed spikes measuring long. The soft coat is reddish to golden brown, in sharp contrast with the white ventral parts. A brown band runs across the chest, and a distinct rufous collar can be observed on the neck. The chin and the medial surfaces of the legs are also white. The face is characterised by large, round dark brown eyes, small translucent ears, a slim muzzle, and a large grayish pink rhinarium. Ecology and behaviour The royal antelope exhibits remarkable alertness, and consequently little is known about its behaviour. The animal will immediately seek cover if alarmed and flees as soon as the danger is very close. It can move swiftly, either by sprinting fast with the body low to the ground, or through strong leaps powered by the large, well-muscled hindlegs. It can cover in a single leap, and rise as high as above the ground. It is typically nocturnal (active at night), though activity may also be observed during the day. It generally rests or ruminates during the day. Territories are marked with dung. The reduced size of the preorbital glands, which are used for scent-marking, could indicate that marking behaviour is not very prominent in this antelope. =Diet= A herbivore, the royal antelope prefers small quantities of fresh foliage and shoots; fruits and fungi may be taken occasionally. Though the antelope is considered to be nocturnal, zoologist Jonathan Kingdon holds that feeding occurs throughout the day, though some foraging may also be observed at night. In comparison to Bates's pygmy antelope, the royal antelope has a longer muzzle, broader lips, a smaller mouth and smaller cheek muscles. These features do not allow complete digestion of lignified growth. Individuals may often move into new locations foraging for fresh growth. =Reproduction= Like other neotragines, the royal antelope is monogamous, though polygamy has been occasionally observed. Individuals of both sexes have been known to reach sexual maturity by six months of age. Births have been reported in November and December. Typically a single, delicate offspring is born after an unknown gestational period, weighing ‚Äì nearly a third of an adult's weight. Young appear similar to adults in colouration. The maximum lifespan of a captive royal antelope was estimated at six years and eight months by a 1993 study. Habitat and distribution The royal antelope prefers areas with fresh and dense growth of shrubs and other plants. It inhabits the warm, moist lowland forests prevalent in western African countries such as C√¥te d'Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The animal's habitat also includes forest fringes and secondary forests. Its geographic range extends eastward from the Kounounkan Massif in southwestern Guinea through Sierra Leone, Liberia and C√¥te d'Ivoire to the Volta River in Ghana. The royal antelope may also be found in the region north to the forested areas of western Africa, which is marked by the interface of forest and savannah habitats. Threats and conservation The royal antelope has been categorised as Least Concern by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN). In 1999, Rod East of the IUCN SSC Antelope Specialist Group estimated the total population to be about 62,000, however this is likely to be an underestimate. The populations are feared to be declining due to habitat deterioration and expanding human settlement. A significant threat to the survival of this antelope is hunting for bushmeat; it is seldom hunted in Sierra Leone and Liberia, whereas it is a major source of bushmeat in C√¥te d'Ivoire. Protected areas where the royal antelope occurs include the Tai National Park, Haut Bandama Fauna and Flora Reserve and Mabi-Yaya Classified Forest (C√¥te d'Ivoire); Kakum National Park and Assin-Attandanso Game Production Reserve (Ghana); Ziama and Diecke Forest Reserves (Guinea); Tiwai Island and Gola Rainforest National Park (Sierra Leone).

Born in the village of Nadiyne (Zaporizhia Oblast, in what is now Ukraine), His family moved to Donetsk when he was a child. He studied at the Donetsk National Technical University. He joined the Soviet Navy in 1932 and graduated from the M. V. Frunze Higher Naval School in 1936. After graduation, he served on submarines in the Black Sea Fleet. Beginning in October 1940 he transferred to the Baltic Fleet and was appointed second in command of the Soviet submarine L-3, and he was named her commander in March 1943. The L-3 was a minelayer submarine, but it was also engaged in offensive operations against German shipping during World War II, ultimately making 11 torpedo attacks under Konovalov's command. On April 16, 1945, Konovalov sank the German ship Goya, carrying civilians and military personnel fleeing from the Eastern Front. At least 6,000 people drowned, with only 165 people saved. It was one of the worst maritime disasters ever. According to some versions, the L-3 also might have sunk a small 1411 GRT ship on January 31, 1945, but it is not confirmed. Konovalov's submarine also laid five mine barrages of 52 mines during the war, one of which sunk a ship Henry L√ºtgens measuring 1141 GRT on January 29, 1945. A torpedo boat T34 was also possibly sunk on mines laid by the L-3, on November 20, 1944. He was awarded the honorary title of Hero of the Soviet Union for an exemplary wartime record on July 8, 1945. From May 1946 to November 1947, he commanded the N-27 (formerly the German Type XXI U-Boat U-3515). In 1950, he graduated from the Voroshilov staff college and from 1958 commanded the submarine brigade of the Baltic Fleet. He was made a rear admiral on May 7, 1966, but died of a stroke in Leningrad the following year. Over the course of his career, Konovalov was awarded the Order of Lenin (three times), the Order of Ushakov 2nd class, the Order of the Patriotic War 1st class (twice), and the Order of the Red Star (twice). In the book and subsequent film The Hunt for Red October, the fictional Soviet Alfa class nuclear-powered attack submarine is named the V.K. Konovalov.

The disease belongs to a family of disorders called the leukodystrophies. The most common clinical manifestations are migraine headaches and transient ischemic attacks or strokes, which usually occur between 40 and 50 years of age, although MRI is able to detect signs of the disease years prior to clinical manifestation of disease. The condition was identified and named by French researchers Marie- Germaine Bousser and Elisabeth Tournier-Lasserve in the 1990s. Signs and symptoms CADASIL may start with attacks of migraine with aura or subcortical transient ischemic attacks or strokes, or mood disorders between 35 and 55 years of age. The disease progresses to subcortical dementia associated with pseudobulbar palsy and urinary incontinence. Ischemic strokes are the most frequent presentation of CADASIL, with approximately 85% of symptomatic individuals developing transient ischemic attacks or stroke(s). The mean age of onset of ischemic episodes is approximately 46 years (range 30‚Äì70). A classic lacunar syndrome occurs in at least two-thirds of affected patients while hemispheric strokes are much less common. It is worthy of note that ischemic strokes typically occur in the absence of traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Recurrent silent strokes, with or without clinical strokes, often lead to cognitive decline and overt subcortical dementia. A case of CADASIL presenting as schizophreniform organic psychosis has been reported. Pathophysiology The underlying pathology of CADASIL is progressive hypertrophy of the smooth muscle cells in blood vessels. Autosomal dominant mutations in the Notch 3 gene (on the long arm of chromosome 19) cause an abnormal accumulation of Notch 3 at the cytoplasmic membrane of vascular smooth muscle cells both in cerebral and extracerebral vessels, seen as granular osmiophilic deposits on electron microscopy. Leukoencephalopathy follows. Depending on the nature and position of each mutation, a consensus significant loss of betasheet structure of the Notch3 protein has been predicted using in silico analysis. Diagnosis A micrograph showing punctate immunostaining (brown) with a Notch 3 antibody, as is characteristic in CADASIL. MRIs show hypointensities on T1-weighted images and hyperintensities on T2-weighted images, usually multiple confluent white matter lesions of various sizes, are characteristic. These lesions are concentrated around the basal ganglia, peri-ventricular white matter, and the pons, and are similar to those seen in Binswanger disease. These white matter lesions are also seen in asymptomatic individuals with the mutated gene. While MRI is not used to diagnose CADASIL, it can show the progression of white matter changes even decades before onset of symptoms. The definitive test is sequencing the whole Notch 3 gene, which can be done from a sample of blood. However, as this is quite expensive and CADASIL is a systemic arteriopathy, evidence of the mutation can be found in small and medium-size arteries. Therefore, skin biopsies are often used for the diagnosis. Treatment No specific treatment for CADASIL is available. While most treatments for CADASIL patients' symptoms ‚Äì including migraine and stroke ‚Äì are similar to those without CADASIL, these treatments are almost exclusively empiric, as data regarding their benefit to CADASIL patients is limited. Antiplatelet agents such as aspirin, dipyridamole, or clopidogrel might help prevent strokes; however, anticoagulation may be inadvisable given the propensity for microhemorrhages. Control of high blood pressure is particularly important in CADASIL patients. Short-term use of atorvastatin, a statin-type cholesterol- lowering medication, has not been shown to be beneficial in CADASIL patients' cerebral hemodynamic parameters, although treatment of comorbidities such as high cholesterol is recommended. Stopping oral contraceptive pills may be recommended. Some authors advise against the use of triptan medications for migraine treatment, given their vasoconstrictive effects, although this sentiment is not universal. In this regard, the advent of the \\"Ditans\\" such as Lasmiditan, lacking vasoconstrictive effect, and the \\"Gepants\\" such as Ubrogepant and Rimegepant, are attractive alternatives, albeit not yet field- tested in this condition. As with other individuals, people with CADASIL should be encouraged to quit smoking. In one small study, around 1/3 of patients with CADASIL were found to have cerebral microhemorrhages (tiny areas of old blood) on MRI. L-arginine, a naturally occurring amino acid, has been proposed as a potential therapy for CADASIL, but as of 2017 there are no clinical studies supporting its use. Donepezil, normally used for Alzheimer's Disease, was not shown not to improve executive functioning in CADASIL patients.  In popular culture  John Ruskin has been suggested to have suffered from CADASIL. Ruskin reported in his diaries having visual disturbances consistent with the disease, and it has also been suggested that it might have been a factor in causing him to describe James Whistler's Nocturne in Black and Gold ‚Äì The Falling Rocket as \\"ask[ing] two hundred guineas for throwing a pot of paint in the public's face\\". This resulted in the famous libel trial that resulted in a jury's awarding Whistler one farthing damages. Recent research into the illness of philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche has suggested that his mental illness and death may have been caused by CADASIL rather than tertiary syphilis. Likewise, the early death of the composer Felix Mendelssohn, at age 37, from a stroke has been potentially linked to CADASIL. His sister, Fanny Mendelssohn, was similarly affected.

The main type of volcanic edifice in the area are scoria cones, it is formed by the La Laguna, Jote and Alumbrera volcanoes. The first and last of these form a sub-group which is better researched. Various dating methods have yielded ages from several million to several hundred thousand years ago, but some vents appear to be of Holocene age.  Geology  = Regional = Volcanic activity in the Andes occurs in four regions, the Northern Volcanic Zone, the Central Volcanic Zone, the Southern Volcanic Zone and the Austral Volcanic Zone. The first three of these are found where the Nazca Plate subducts beneath the South America Plate, while the last zone occurs at the subduction zone of the Antarctic Plate.B√°ez et al. 2017, p.313 The Andean Central Volcanic Zone runs along the Western Cordillera of the Andes and along the Altiplano. During the Neogene, the position of this volcanic arc moved eastward and the arc became broader, probably due to a change in the tilt of the slab of the Nazca Plate. Volcanic activity during this time was heavily influenced by local strike-slip faults which acted to channel the magma flows. About 7 million years ago, tectonics and volcanic activity changed in the region probably in response to the delamination of the crust beneath the region: Large scale ignimbrites were erupted at Gal√°n and small back-arc volcanoes erupted mafic basaltic andesite lavas. These small volcanic centres consist of lava domes, lava flows, maars, scoria cones and tuff rings.B√°ez et al. 2017, p.312 = Local = The Antofagasta de la Sierra volcanic field lies within the north-south trending tectonic depression of the same name, in the Catamarca Province. Of the individual vents the La Laguna and Alumbrera cones are the best studied ones,B√°ez et al. 2017, p.313-314 they lie about south of Antofagasta de la Sierra. These volcanoes are associated with black lava flow fields. The Jote volcanoes consist of a cluster of cinder cones and lava flows. Alumbrera cone is high and has an elliptical shape with a maximum length of , probably due to wind influencing the growth of the cone. The cone shows signs of having been gravitationally unstable, including a sector collapse on its northwestern flank. The cone has a wide crater and a few fissure vents. Alumbrera has a volume of and is the source of a large lava flow field which covers a surface of and surrounds the Alumbrera cone. Lapilli fill the crater of Alumbrera, which has alum, ochre and sulfur colours. La Laguna is smaller than Alumbrera: The cone is only high and wide, with a deep crater. As with Alumbrera La Laguna features one fissure vent and a lava flow field, with a smaller volume of and surface area of .B√°ez et al. 2017, p.314 Both La Laguna and Alumbrera were fed by northwest-striking fissures, which is unusual as most lineaments in the area strike northeastwards or north-south. The surfaces of erupted rocks have been subject to various degrees of wind-driven erosion which has left grooves in the most altered units. Most likely the magma supply at these two vents was so large that the rising dykes were able to force pre-existent lineaments open and to pass through them.B√°ez et al. 2017, p.328 = Composition = Alumbrera and La Laguna has erupted alkaline to sub-alkaline basaltic trachyandesite to trachybasalt with a porphyritic texture. Phenocrysts within the rock include olivine and plagioclase or clinopyroxene, which form also the bulk of the matrix.B√°ez et al. 2017, p.319-323 The Jote lavas have similar composition to the La Laguna rocks. The chemical composition of the old and the new La Laguna volcanoes is different, with the old lavas showing a more volcanic arc-like composition. \\"Alum\\" (in reality a mixture of aluminium sulfate and magnesium sulfate) found at Alumbrera was mined by the local population.Reichert 1907, p.80-81  Eruptive history  Eruptions at Alumbrera occurred in two phases, the first formed toothpaste lava and aa lava and the second in addition to lava small pyroclastic flows and a tephra blanket. A scoria fallout is found as far as east of Alumbrera. During this second phase, the sector collapse at Alumbrera occurred and was followed by the emission of lava bombs during Strombolian eruptions. La Laguna at first erupted several now heavily eroded lava flows and formed an old cone.B√°ez et al. 2017, p.325 Later during a second phase of activity lava bombs and scoria formed a newer cone and two lava flow fields.B√°ez et al. 2017, p.326-327 At both volcanoes, phreatomagmatic activity may have occurred after the magma pressure dropped so far that water could enter the conduit. The eruptions probably lasted several weeks to several years.B√°ez et al. 2017, p.332 A lava flow at La Laguna cone has been dated to 340,000 ¬± 60,000 years before present, consistent with its older appearance.B√°ez et al. 2017, p.327 A large-scale research project in the Puna yielded a number of Ar-Ar and K-Ar dates, including 3.2 and 4.5 million years ago for Jote and 0.3 and 7.3 million years ago for Alumbrera and La Laguna.Risse et al. 2008, p.4-5 The older age appears to refer to a mesa just west of the Alumbrera lava field.Risse et al. 2008, p.10 Historical activity is unknown, and in 1907 the volcanoes were considered to be extinct,Reichert 1907, p.79 but the field may have had eruptions during the Holocene; the young appearance of Alumbrera suggests a Holocene age for this cone. Renewed activity in the field could cause ash to fall over hundreds of square kilometres of adjoining land and generate dangerous pyroclastic density currents close to the vent.  Other  Between the Antofagasta and Alumbrera volcanoes lies the Antofagasta lake. The vegetation in the area is shrub steppe, and fairly sunny and dry. The Antofagasta River coming from the north forms a large wetland before the relatively deep Antofagasta lake; the Alumbrera volcano borders the lake in the south. A major archeological site is emplaced on the Antofagasta volcano.

Early life McCracken was born in Provo, Utah, and grew up in Orem, Utah, and was raised in a Mormon family. He has three sisters (Katie, Melanie, Rachel) and one younger brother (Joseph Taylor). McCracken has stated that he read quite vigorously growing up, due to the influence of his mother, who was a schoolteacher. At age 12, he started playing the trumpet in a local band called \\"I'm With Stupid\\". He attended Timpanogos High School for a brief time, before dropping out at 16. Eldest son of the household, Bert enjoyed a happy home life as a child, but as he grew into a teenager his and his parents' views conflicted. He rebelled against his parents and against their Mormon religion. He dropped out of high school; soon after, he left his home at the age of 16. For some time he was homeless until he found enough money for an apartment, moving in with then-girlfriend Kate. Career In January 2001, when the band called Dumb Luck (which later became The Used, then consisting of Quinn, Jeph and Branden) were looking for a singer, Quinn remembered Bert and he was invited to try out. After being given music that the band had written without words, Bert wrote the lyrics to what would become \\"Maybe Memories\\" and returned the next day with a newly recorded version of the song. The band welcomed him immediately, and renamed themselves \\"Used\\". They were eventually discovered by John Feldmann and signed to Reprise Records; they became \\"The Used\\" when it was discovered that a Boston band had already trademarked the name \\"Used\\". On June 25, 2002 they released their self-titled debut album. Personal life McCracken appeared on the MTV show The Osbournes while he was dating Kelly Osbourne, to her mother's dismay and disapproval. In 2004, McCracken's then-pregnant ex-girlfriend Kate died of a drug overdose, as the recording of The Used's second album In Love and Death was coming to a close. In July 2008, McCracken married his Australian fianc√©e, Allison, at a private ceremony in Los Angeles. In July 2013, he announced that he and his wife had relocated from Los Angeles to Sydney, Australia, where their first daughter, Cleo Rose McCracken, was born in January 2014. Their second child, Minerva \\"Minnie\\" Bloom McCracken, was born on March 23, 2018.Imaginary Enemy Album Booklet McCracken has struggled with drug addiction and alcoholism in the past, the former referenced in the song \\"Bulimic\\" on The Used's self-titled album. However, he has since overcome his addictions, being sober since 2012. Bert McCracken has voiced his support for Palestine alongside being critical of aspects of contemporary American culture and society, such as the influence of larger corporations on the music industry; which partly prompted his move to Australia in 2013. His political views were also influential in the lyrical content of The Used's 2014 album Imaginary Enemy. About a year prior to the recording of The Used's 2017 album The Canyon, McCracken's friend Tregen died via suicide which heavily influenced the album's lyrical content.

These cats should be kept indoors and seen to by specialist veterinarians, as long term management of the condition is essential for quality of life in these cats.Kangaroo Cats and Squittens Revealed (October 2006) It is an example of a cat body type genetic mutation. The word is a portmanteau of squirrel and kitten. The term kangaroo cat is also, rarely, used; this derives from a 1953 specimen known as the Stalingrad Kangaroo Cat.Robinson Roy (1999), \\"Genetics for Cat Breeders and Veterinarians\\", Butterworth Heinemann, Characteristics A squitten with foreleg micromelia sitting in upright posture, showing short forelimbs The term squitten is generally used to refer to cats with the condition radial hypoplasia (underdeveloped radius bones) or foreleg micromelia (small forelegs) and related conditions known as radial aplasia (absent radius bones), radial agenesis (failure of radius bones to form) that produces stunted forelegs. The mutation sometimes occurs in the random-breeding population, particularly in inbred populations where recessive genes may be exhibited. Such cats have also been called twisty cats; In the late 1990s, several were deliberately bred at Karma Farms, a horse farm and cattery in Marshall, Texas,Flipper-One Cute Twisty Kat and the Truth![VETPET] National News Coverage of Twisty Cat Story resulting in a public outcry against the operators of the farm. Radial hypoplasia is related to one form of polydactyly, sometimes called patty feet or hamburger feet by cat lovers to distinguish them from thumb cat polydactyls. Ordinary mitten cat polydactyls are not affected.Polydactyl Cats (October 2006)What Happened to the Maine Coon Polydactyl? (October 2006) Cats with radial hypoplasia or similar mutations often sit on their rump with their forelegs unable to touch the floor; this gives them a resemblance to a squirrel or kangaroo. This raises special care considerations for owners of affected cats. Kittens may be unable to knead effectively with their short forelegs; kneading is required to stimulate milk flow in the mother. The short or twisted forelegs cause mobility problems and such cats may adapt by using their hindlegs in a hopping gait. A corresponding condition affecting the hind legs is called femoral hypoplasia and has only been reported three times in cats.Feline Radial and Femoral Hypoplasia (October 2006) Typical characteristics of a squitten are short forelegs, with a short radius and ulna which may be twisted or absent, extra front toes, and normal-length hind legs.

Biography Steineckert is an avid soccer fan and supporter of Real Salt Lake, a Major League Soccer (MLS) club based in Sandy, Utah. He is a season ticket holder and writer of the official team chant 'Believe'. Branden was born in Pocatello, Idaho, and was raised in a Mormon family which moved more than twenty times during his youth. He picked up skateboarding at an early age because his friends skated. When Branden was 11 years old, his father, Neil Steineckert, died by suicide, so he picked up drumming as a way to release his anger and to relieve him of his troubles. Branden learned to play the drums because his late father had played drums at around his age. He was a founding member of Strange Itch, a band that would later become The Used, and would go on to achieve success, earning a platinum and gold album. When asked in an interview what he would be doing if he were not a musician, he stated he would be \\"skateboarding\\". On November 3, 2006, it was announced that Steineckert would be playing drums for Rancid until the end of their tour. He replaced their drummer of 15 years, Brett Reed. On the tour, Rancid members stated that Steineckert would be a permanent addition to the band (also noted on the official Used fansite). In the August 2009 issue of DRUM! Magazine, Steineckert commented on how quickly things moved as soon as he began to play with Rancid: ‚ÄúIt was nuts. My first show, I was playing songs I‚Äôd never played even on a drum set, in front of 2,500 kids in England.‚Äù Branden's first recording with the band was their 2009 album Let the Dominoes Fall, although it had been in the writing process since 2005, a year before he joined. He also appeared on their eighth album Honor Is All We Know, which was released on October 27, 2014. In late 2010 Steineckert filled in for Goldfinger's drummer (Darrin Pfeiffer) for a few West Coast shows due to prior arrangements.

Jumping turnstiles, boarding buses through the back or very quickly through the front, and leaving doors open in subway stations are some tactics used. In some cases, transit operators obstruct the fare box to prevent anyone from paying. Often, fare strikes are used to protest against fare hikes and service cuts, but they can also organize solidarity between riders and drivers. History The first historical mention of a fare strike in the United States was in 1944 in Cleveland, Ohio when \\"streetcar workers threatened to refuse to collect fares in order to win a pay increase.\\" The action was effective because \\"the City Council gave in before they actually used the tactic.\\" These kinds of \\"social strikes,\\" collective acts of refusal where workers continue to provide services (in this case, transit) but do not collect any money, have occurred in France and parts of Latin America. In 1969, Italy's \\"Hot Autumn\\" was sparked at FIAT's Mirafiori plant in Turin and spilled past the factory gates as workers coordinated movements using other forms of the social strike: FIAT workers refused to pay for the trams and buses and went into stores to demand reductions in prices, backed only by showing their factory ID badges. Others squatted houses and collectively refused to pay utility bills.Giachette, D. & Scavino, M. (1999). La Fiat in mano agli operai: L‚Äôautunno caldo del 1969. Pisa, Biblioteca Franco Serantini. These kinds of struggles spread throughout Italy until the end of the 1970s. Another type of social strike occurred during the 1970 postal strike in the United States when \\"letter carriers promised to deliver welfare checks even while on strike.\\"Root & Branch, eds. (1975). Root & Branch: The Rise of the Workers' Movements.Greenwich, CN: Fawcett Publications, p. 209. In 2004, much like in the 1944 example in Cleveland, the Chicago group Midwest Unrest was able to organize a fare strike that forced the Chicago Transit Authority to back down on service cuts and fare increases. In 2005, at least 5,000 riders participated in the first ever fare strike in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. In San Francisco, in 2005, \\"Despite heavy police presence at major bus transfer points, at least a couple thousand passengers rode the buses for free in San Francisco on Thursday, September 1st - the opening day of a fare strike in North America's most bus- intensive city.\\" Two of the main groups involved in organizing this were Muni Social Strike and Muni Fare Strike. Other community groups also participated, including the Chinese Progressive Association and \\"the one major extension of the strike, through the participation of the day laborers' organization in organizing among Spanish-speaking immigrants\\" working class in San Francisco's Mission District, where the strike was most successful. In the United Kingdom, there were fare strikes against First Great Western in January 2007 and January 2008. In Montreal, striking students in 2005 often used the subway as a means of transportation during demonstrations. As a group, the demonstration would enter the subway without paying, usually while chanting \\"M√©tro populaire.\\" In New York City, Occupy Wall Street activists chained and taped open service gates and turnstiles to the subway system to protest \\"escalating service cuts, fare hikes, racist policing, assaults on transit workers' working conditions and livelihoods ‚Äî and the profiteering of the super-rich by way of a system they've rigged in their favor\\" on March 28, 2012. In Grand Rapids, in 2016, a coalition of community activists boarded numerous city buses and refused to pay; part of a \\"Day of Action\\" against the Interurban Transit Partnership (ITP), which culminated in a sit-in aimed at disrupting the scheduled ITP board meeting later that same day. The activists were protesting the board's refusal to negotiate a contract settlement with the workers of Amalgamated Transit Union Local 836, violations of those workers' First Amendment rights, a 16% fare hike, and a raise given to CEO, Peter Varga, while these perceived attacks on workers and riders were taking place.

Georgi Plekhanov, who was one of the organisers of the demonstration, gave a passionate speech during the demonstration, indicting the autocracy and defending the ideas of Chernyshevsky, who was then in exile. One of the workers - Ya.Potapov - waved a red flag. The demonstrators offered resistance to the police.

In 1969, he became the first person to perform a single-handed non- stop circumnavigation of the globe. Along with Sir Peter Blake, he won the second Jules Verne Trophy, for which they were also named the ISAF Yachtsman of the Year award. In 2007, at the age of 67, he set a record as the oldest yachtsman to complete a round the world solo voyage in the Velux 5 Oceans Race. Life =Early life= Knox-Johnston was born in Putney in London, his birth was registered in Wandsworth, in 1939. He was the eldest child of David R Knox-Johnston (1910-1970) and Elizabeth Magill n√©e Cree (1908-1977), who were married in Tring, in 1937.https://www.freebmd.org.uk Knox-Johnston was educated at the Berkhamsted boys' school. From 1957 to 1968, he served in the Merchant Navy and the Royal Naval Reserve. In 1965, he sailed his William Atkins design ketch Suhaili from Bombay to England. Her design is based on the Norwegian sailing lifeboat designs of Colin Archer. Due to a lack of money he had to interrupt his voyage for work in South Africa as Master of a coaster and stevedoring and was only able to complete it in 1967. In 1968, he was one of nine sailors who attempted to achieve the first solo non-stop circumnavigation of the world in the Sunday Times's Golden Globe race. He was the third sailor to start the race, and the only one to complete the voyage. =Family= In early 1962, in Cambridge, he married Suzanne (Sue) Singer, whom he had known from the age of eight; they had one daughter, Sara, who was born in Bombay whilst he was at sea. His wife left him when he proposed taking her and the child back to England in his new boat Suhaili, and they were divorced in 1967. However, in 1972 they remarried in Winchester, and now have five grandchildren, Florence, Oscar, Xavier, Ralph, and Valentine. Sue died in 2003. Circumnavigation of the Earth The route of the Golden Globe Race On 14 June 1968 Knox-Johnston left Falmouth in his 32-foot (9.8-metre) boat Suhaili, one of the smallest boats to enter the Sunday Times Golden Globe Race. Despite losing his self-steering gear off Australia, he rounded Cape Horn on 17 January 1969, 20 days before his closest competitor Bernard Moitessier. Moitessier had sailed from Plymouth more than two months after Knox-Johnston, but he subsequently abandoned the race and instead sailed on to Tahiti. The other seven competitors dropped out at various stages, leaving Knox-Johnston to win the race and become officially the first person to circumnavigate the globe non-stop and single-handed on 22 April 1969, the day he returned to Falmouth. Knox-Johnston donated his prize money for fastest competitor, a sum of ¬£5,000, to the family of Donald Crowhurst, another competitor in the race who had committed suicide after attempting to fake his round the world voyage. In recognition of his achievement, he was created a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE). =Further exploits= In 1970 (with Leslie Williams) and in 1974 (with Gerry Boxall), Knox-Johnston won the two-handed Round Britain Race. Knox-Johnston, Williams and their crew, which included Peter Blake, took line honours of the 1971 Cape Town to Rio Race. Williams and Knox-Johnston jointly skippered (with Blake a crew member again) maxi yacht Heath's Condor in the 1977 Whitbread Round the World Race. They took the line honours in the second and fourth leg, the ones which Knox- Johnston skippered. Knox-Johnston and Blake (who acted as co-skippers) won the Jules Verne Trophy for the fastest circumnavigation in 1994. Their time was 74 days 22 hours 18 minutes and 22 seconds. It was their second attempt to win this prize after their first one in 1992 had to be aborted when their catamaran Enza hit an object which tore a hole in the starboard hull. From 1992 to 2001, Knox-Johnston was president of the Sail Training Association. During his tenure the money was collected to replace the STA's vessels Sir Winston Churchill and Malcolm Miller with the new, larger brigs Prince William and Stavros S. Niarchos. He was trustee of the National Maritime Museum at Greenwich from 1992 to 2002 and still is trustee of the National Maritime Museum ‚Äì Cornwall at Falmouth, where Suhaili is berthed today. The yacht has been refitted and took part in the Round the Island Race in June 2005. He was created a knight bachelor in 1995. In 1996, Knox-Johnston established the first Clipper Round the World Yacht Race and has since worked with the Clipper Ventures company as chairman to progress the race to higher levels every year. It is perhaps his greatest achievement to have introduced so many people to competitive sailing via their involvement in Clipper Ventures. He completed his second solo circumnavigation of the world in the yacht Saga Insurance on 4 May 2007, finishing in fourth place in the Velux 5 Oceans Race. At 68 he was the oldest competitor in the race. In late 2008 and early 2009, Knox-Johnston took part in a BBC programme called Top Dogs: Adventures in War, Sea and Ice. The programme saw him unite with fellow British legends Sir Ranulph Fiennes, the adventurer, and John Simpson, the BBC world affairs editor. The team went on three trips, each experiencing each other's adventure field. The first episode, aired on 27 March 2009, saw Knox-Johnston, Fiennes and Simpson go on a potentially very dangerous news-gathering trip to Afghanistan. The team reported from the legendary Khyber Pass and infamous Tora Bora mountain complex. The three also undertook a voyage around Cape Horn and an expedition hauling sledges across the deep-frozen Frobisher Bay in the far north of Canada. Having served two years as president of The Cruising Association, Knox-Johnston is now the association's patron. He is also a past-president of the Little Ship Club. In November 2014, Knox-Johnston, at age 75, finished the solo transatlantic race the Route du Rhum in third place in the Rhum class. He crossed the finish line on his Open 60 Grey Power at Pointe √† Pitre at 16:52 hours local time/20:52 hours GMT after 20 days, 7 hours, 52 minutes and 22 seconds at sea. During the 2019‚Äì2020 coronavirus pandemic, Knox-Johnston was one of several notable figures interviewed by The Guardian about their experiences with social isolation.

Traditional art forms  Construction of a Samoan fale, c. 1896 (see: Architecture of Samoa) Pe'a, traditional male tattoo. Both men and women can be tattooed (tatau). A man's tattoo is called the soga'i miki while a woman's tattoo is called a malu. Women play an important part in contributing with their skills in items of important cultural value including 'ie toga, finely woven mats used in ceremony and gift exchanges. In terms of material goods, during ritual exchange, women give fine mats 'ie toga and decorated bark cloth siapo while men give woodworking items and red feathers. Bark cloth, called siapo in Samoa (similar to the Fijian tapa cloth called masi), both of which is made from beaten mulberry bark. Patterns or pictures are painted on with a natural brown dye taken from a tree source. These pictures typically depict abstract and realistic depictions of plant life, shells, fish, turtles, and hibiscus flowers. The siapo may be used for clothing, for wrapping objects and even simply for decorative reasons. Ornaments, jewellery and hair accessories are made from naturally occurring materials such as sea shells, coconut and coir. Traditional Samoan medicine is often practiced as a first-line before hospital medicine. This is a type of alternative medicine using plant leaves to massage the affected area. Wooden figurative sculpture was extremely rare in pre-Christian Samoa, and shares some similarities with Fijian and Tongan sculpture. = 'Ava ceremony = The 'ava ceremony is the most significant ritual which takes place before all important occasions, including the bestowal of matai chiefly titles. The overall ceremony is highly ritualized, with specific gestures and phrases to be used at various times. Ceremonial items for the 'ava ceremony include the tanoa (round wooden bowl) similar to those used in the kava cultures of other Polynesian societies. The tanoa are made of varying sizes supported by many short legs around it. These bowls and other related instruments are often highly decorated. Known as kava in other parts of Polynesia, the 'ava is a beverage produced from a plant that is drunk throughout the western Pacific region. The drinking of ava in Samoa is generally done through highly ritualized ava ceremonies. The kava is prepared by a group of people called aumaga. It is brought to each participant by the tautuaava, or ava server, in the order proscribed by the tufaava, or ava distributor. Usually, the highest chief of the visiting party is served first, followed by the highest chief of the host party, and then service proceeds based on the rank of the rest of the participants. The drink is served in a polished coconut half shell.  Dance  Boy performing a Samoan fire dance (siva afi). The traditional Samoan dance is the siva. The female siva is with gentle movements of the hands and feet in time to music. The sasa is a group dance performed sitting to a drum rhythm. Samoan males traditionally perform the fa'ataupati (slap dance), usually performed in a group with no music accompaniment. Other types of dance are modern dance by the younger generations. Traditional Samoan dance is arguably the one area of Samoan culture that has not been touched by Western Civilization. The maulu'ulu is a group dance performed by female counterparts only, also the taualuga is the main Samoan traditional dance that is performed by a village chief (manaia) or village chiefess (taupou). It is often performed at weddings, birthdays and other Samoan celebrations.Samoan Sensation. http://www.samoa.co.uk/dance.html In the Samoan culture the Taualuga is used for special celebrations, started by the village chief's son (manaia) or village chief's daughter (taupou). The Tuiga is a Samoan Traditional headpiece(crown) that is made out of different types of things like feathers, human hair, and a variety of different types of shells. Also it's now a privilege to wear the Tuiga because in the 19th century it was only to be worn by the high chief's son, daughter, and also by extended families. Before they start the taualuga, he or she must bow their head and spread out their hands to the people, to thank the people for coming out and for their support. This happens before and after the taualuga. The way we prepare the outfit is stressful. But the outfit is made from fine woven mats that symbolizes time, honor, and traditions, then we add red feathers from the birds of the islands. Next the outfit with a Tapa is made from the bark of the tree and it represents the art and the craft of the Samoan culture. Then there was The Ula Nifo it's a necklace that is made from whale-tooth that is worn by the head chief or worn by the person who dances the taualuga. It was also a symbol of wealth. Finally, the meaning of the dance. Back in Samoa in the 19th century the person who performed the dance was the high chief's son or daughter that was a virgin.  Languages  In American Samoa, most people are bilingual; they speak both English and Samoan. People in Samoa are also bilingual, but Samoan is stronger and more widely spoken, although the inhabitants of Swains Island speak Tokelauan. Names The meaning of a given name is important when naming a child in the Samoan community: * personal traits: Malosi (strong), Umi (tall), Vave (fast), Faiaivale (foolish) * religious: Toefuata‚Äôigaoletalalelei (restoration of the Gospel) * events: Dodiana (this name was created to commemorate Dodi Fayed and Princess Diana's death) * objects: Tala (dollar) * animals: Maile (dog) * descriptive: Leilani (heavenly flower) * traditional: Pua‚Äôa‚Äôelo (this was the name of a Samoan high chief)NamepediA Blog - Names Under the Dome: a Peek into Samoan Culture, article about Samoan culture and naming traditions  Dress  The traditional ladies clothing is the puletasi which is a matching skirt and tunic with Samoan designs. The lava-lava is a sarong which may be worn by men or women. They are of different patterns and colors, but tend to be plain for men who may wear it as part of an official uniform. Some men have intricate and geometrical patterns that are tattooed onto their lower body and upper legs. The tattooing process is performed without any anaesthesia and is extremely painful. Ceremonial attire includes a headdress called tuiga which is made of shells and feathers.  Cuisine  Samoan umu, an oven of hot rocks above ground Sundays are traditionally a day of rest, and many families congregate to share an umu together for a Sunday afternoon meal. In a traditional household, the older members of the family will sit and eat first, and as the meal continues the younger members and then children are invited to eat. The umu contains an abundance and variety of dishes ranging from a whole pig, fresh seaweed and crayfish to baked taro and rice. Coconut appears in many Samoan dishes, for example, luau, a parcel of coconut cream wrapped in taro leaves baked in the umu. This dish is eaten in its entirety including the leaves and is rich in taste due to its coconut content.  Religion  A church in Matavai village, Savai'i Religion in Samoa encompasses a range of groups, but nearly 100% of the population in Samoa is Christian.International Religious Freedom Report 2007: Samoa. United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor (September 14, 2007). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. The 2001 Census revealed the following distribution of Christian groups: Congregational Christian, 34.8 percent; Roman Catholic, 19.6 percent; Methodist, 15 percent; The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , 12.7 percent; Assemblies of God, 6.6 percent; and Seventh-day Adventist, 3.5 percent. These statistics reflected continual growth in the number and size of Mormons and Assemblies of God and a relative decline in the membership of the historically larger denominations. The following groups constitute less than 5 percent of the population: Nazarene, Anglican, Congregational Church of Jesus, Worship Centre, Jehovah's Witnesses, Full Gospel, Peace Chapel, Elim Church, Voice of Christ, and Baptist. Historic Methodist Chapel at Piula Theological College on Upolu island There are also members of other religions such as Islam and the Bah√° º√≠ Faith; the shared estimate of the Bah√° º√≠ population in Samoa circa 2000 according to a profile by the World Council of Churches and the online encyclopedia Encarta was 2% of the nation‚Äîsome 3600 people‚Äîand the only non- Christian community of any number. The country hosts one of only seven Bah√° º√≠ Houses of Worship in the world. The Bah√° º√≠ Houses of Worship was dedicated by Malietoa Tanumafili II, King of Samoa (1913-2007), who was the first reigning Bah√°'√≠ monarch. Although there were no official data, it is generally believed that there are also some practicing Hindus, Buddhists, and Jews in the capital city. All religious groups are multiethnic; none are composed exclusively of foreign nationals or native-born (Western) Samoans. There are no sizable foreign national or immigrant groups, with the exception of U.S. nationals from American Samoa. Missionaries operated freely within the country. There is strong societal pressure at the village and local level to participate in church services and other activities, and financially support church leaders and projects. In some denominations, such financial contributions often total more than 30 percent of family income. The constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the government generally respected this right in practice. The US government found there to be no reports of societal abuses or discrimination based on religious belief or practice in 2007.  Sports  Samoa performing their Siva Tau before playing South Africa at the 2007 Rugby World Cup. The main sports played in Samoa are rugby union and Samoan cricket (kilikiti). In rugby there are the 3 D's. 1 defence, 2 discipline, and the 3rd one is the DAKKLE. About 30 ethnic Samoans, many from American Samoa, currently play in the NFL. A 2002 article from ESPN estimated that a Samoan male (either an American Samoan, or a Samoan living in the 50 United States) is 40 times more likely to play in the NFL than a non-Samoan American. A number have also ventured into professional wrestling. Soccer is a popular sport in Samoa, with the national team being ranked 149th in the world. Rugby union is the most popular sport in Samoa. The national team is consistently competitive against teams from vastly more populous nations. Samoa have competed at every Rugby World Cup since 1991, and have made the quarter finals in 1991, 1995 and 1999. Samoa also play in the Pacific Nations Cup. The sport is governed by the Samoa Rugby Football Union, who are members of the Pacific Islands Rugby Alliance, and thus, also contribute to the international Pacific Islanders rugby union team. At club level, there is the National Provincial Championship and Pacific Rugby Cup. Prominent Samoan players include Pat Lam and Brian Lima. In addition, there are many Samoans that have played for or are playing for the All Blacks. Rugby league is a popular sport in Samoa, with the national team reaching the quarter finals of the 2000 Rugby League World Cup. Australian rules football is a popular sport in Samoa, played as Samoa Rules with the national team, the Bulldogs, competing at the Arafura Games and the 2002 and 2005 Australian Football International Cup. Samoans have been very visible in American professional wrestling, despite the relatively small population of the islands. Dwayne Johnson, Peter Maivia, Yokozuna, Umaga/Jamal, Manu, Rosey, Samoa Joe, The Wild Samoans, The Headshrinkers, Rikishi, Roman Reigns, and Sonny Siaki all have a Samoan heritage. = Sports in American Samoa = Sports in American Samoa are influenced by American culture and American football and its league, NFL are popular. For the Independent State of Samoa, New Zealand and British influences has led to the popularity of rugby union, soccer, netball and volleyball.  Fa'aaloaloga  The most salient and perhaps the most prominent part of Samoan culture at formal events is the process of Fa'aaloaloga (formal presentation of gifts). At weddings, chiefly installations (sa'ofaiga), funerals, opening of houses / churches, or any other public gathering of Samoans, Fa'aaloaloga will always be performed. Ever since the formalisation of Christianity in Samoa and the inclusion of the Christian taeao or mornings into the general recitation of 'mornings' in Samoan speeches, the set protocol has been that the first presentations are always presented to the religious representatives present at the event. This is followed by the highest ranking chiefs by order of rank. A standard set of presentation is called the sua. This is usually made up of vailolo (drink with money in it; originally it was a coconut and a coconut frond called tuaniu), amoamosa (tray of biscuits and material or a combination of other small foodstuffs like a can of corned beef), and a suatalisua (a box of corned beef and chicken or similar). This is followed by a fine mat or several fine mats (mats of state - ie o le malo), which could vary from long to long and high. Depending on the occasion and the rank of the person, each of those elements above could be magnified several times by the addition of numbers, and could also include a huge tapa cloth being tied to the young lady presenting the vailolo or draped several metres behind her as she presents it.  Other  In American Samoa, there is a location called Turtle and Shark which is important in Samoan culture ‚Äî it has a legend, about two people who turned into a turtle and a shark. The U.S. National Park Service says the following about Turtle and Shark: \\"Villagers from nearby Vaitogi continue to reenact an important aspect of the legend at Turtle and Shark by performing a ritual song intended to summon the legendary animals to the ocean surface, and visitors are frequently amazed to see one or both of these creatures emerge from the sea in apparent response to this call.\\"https://www.nps.gov/nr/feature/places/pdfs/14000925.pdf National Register of Historic Places Registration Form - Turtle and Shark (American Samoa).

The initially successful offensive against the Republic of Estonia ignited the Estonian War of Independence which ended with the Soviet recognition of Estonia. The war against Republics of Latvia and Lithuania was more successful for the Soviets, and resulted in the Latvian Socialist Soviet Republic and Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republics being established. In Belarus, the Belarusian People's Republic was conquered and the Socialist Soviet Republic of Byelorussia proclaimed. The campaign eventually bogged down and led to the Estonian Pskov Offensive, the White Russian Petrograd Offensives, the Lithuanian‚ÄìSoviet War, the Latvian War of Independence, continuation of the Ukrainian‚ÄìSoviet War and the start of the Polish-Soviet War. Soviet war aims The newly formed Red Army was growing in personnel, and Vladimir Lenin could gather enough strength to replace withdrawing Western curtain forces (\\"–ó–∞–ø–∞–¥–Ω–∞—è –∑–∞–≤–µ—Å–∞\\") by solid military and re-take the lands lost by Russia in 1917 by simply following the withdrawing German army. Upon receiving the news about the German Revolution, on November 13, 1918, the Soviet government annulled the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and issued orders to the Red Army to move in the direction of Belarus, Ukraine and the Baltic States in order to establish Soviet governments there. The newly- created (on November 16) Western Army moved at night of November 17, 1918, into the operational vacuum created by the withdrawing German Imperial army. This move, in the general direction of Belarus, Ukraine and Poland (parts of the latter within Imperial Russia were referred to as \\"Privislinsky Krai\\" ), according to N. Davies, was code-named \\"Target-Vistula\\". The offensive in the Vistula River direction by the newly created Western Army had the aim of establishing similar Soviet governments in Belarus, Ukraine and Poland and to drive as far west as possible in order to join up with the German Revolution and to ignite the World revolution. Background After signing the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, Bolshevik Russia lost the European lands it annexed in the 18th and 19th centuries. Most of today's Poland, Belarus, Ukraine and the Baltic States were granted to the government of Germany, which in turn decided to grant these states limited independence as buffer states. However, the German defeat on the Western Front and the internal dissolution of Austria-Hungary made the plans for creation of Mitteleuropa obsolete. In November and December the German army started a retreat westwards. Demoralised officers and mutinous soldiers abandoned their garrisons en masse and returned home. The areas abandoned by the Central Powers became a field of conflict between local puppet governments created by Germany as part of its plans, local nationalist governments that sprung up after the withdrawal of the German forces, Poland, and the Bolsheviks wanting to incorporate these areas into Soviet Russia. Belarusian, Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Ukrainian and even Cossack national governments were formed. Internal power struggles prevented any of the governments in Belarus from gaining lasting power. In Ukraine the situation was even more complex, with an ongoing conflict between Nestor Makhno's anarchists, communists, the White Movement, various governments of Ukraine and the reborn Polish Army. The entire region abandoned by the German forces became a gigantic free-for-all theatre, where dozens of factions competed for power. The Bolsheviks were also implementing a new strategy, \\"Revolution from abroad\\" (Revolutsiya izvne‚Äîliterally, \\"revolution from the outside\\"), based on an assumption that revolutionary masses desire revolution but are unable to carry it out without help from more organized and advanced Bolsheviks. Hence, as Leon Trotsky remarked, the revolution should be \\"brought on the bayonets\\" (of the Red Army), as \\"through Kiev leads the straight route for uniting with the Austro-Hungarian revolution, just as through Pskov and Vilnius goes the way for uniting with the German revolution.

The 6th Red Division captured the railway junction of Tapa from the freshly formed Estonian 4th and 5th Regiments on Christmas Eve and advanced to from the capital Tallinn. On 29 November in Narva, Estonian Bolsheviks led by Jaan Anvelt proclaimed the Commune of the Working People of Estonia (ETK). In south Estonia the 49th Red Latvian Rifle Regiment took the railway junction of Valga on 17 December and the city of Tartu on 24 December. The Estonian Army stopped the 7th Red Army's advance along the entire front on 2‚Äì5 January. Two days later Estonian forces began the counteroffensive to expel the Soviet forces from Estonia. A Finnish volunteer marine brigade landed in the rear of the 6th Red Division, and the 1st Estonian Division captured Narva on 18 January. Subsequently, the northeastern front stabilized along the Narva River. In South Estonia the Estonian commando-type Tartumaa Partisan Battalion drove the Red Latvian rifle regiments out of Valga on 31 January. The 7th Red Army was temporally forced out of the boundaries of Estonia. On 16 February the Red army started a counteroffensive to recapture Estonia. The newly formed Estonian Red Army gained the Setomaa, Vastseliina and R√§pina Parishes by 15 March. The Estonian 2nd Division counterattacked and regained Petseri by 28 March. Similar combat took place between the Estonian Army and the Northern Group of the Latvian Red Army along the Aina≈æi‚ÄìStrenƒçi‚ÄìAl≈´ksne front stabilised in northern Latvia. In the positions along the Narva River, the Estonian 1st Division repelled 7th Red Army attacks.Estonian War of Independence 1918‚Äì1920. Jyri Kork (Ed.). Esto, Baltimore, 1988 (Reprint from Estonian War of Independence 1918‚Äì1920. Historical Committee for the War of Independence, Tallinn, 1938) =Polish direction= The Red Army entered Polotsk on 21 November, Drissa and Rahachow on 22 November, Zhlobin on 24 November, Babruysk on 28 November, Barysaw on 3 December, Slutsk on 8 December and Igumen on 9 December. On 10 December 1918, the Red Army entered Minsk almost unopposed, putting an end to the short-lived Belarusian People's Republic. On 1 January 1919, the Socialist Soviet Republic of Byelorussia (SSRB) was proclaimed in Smolensk. On 8 January, the SSRB government relocated to Minsk. At the same time Polish and Belarusian self-defence units sprung up across western Belarus. Ill-equipped and composed mostly of local recruits, they were determined to defend their homes from what the newspapers described as a \\"Red menace\\". Similar Bolshevik groups were operating in the sector and a series of skirmishes ensued. The Polish-Soviet struggle over Vilna in the first week of 1919 was a sign of things to come, as the Polish militia was forced to withdraw after the first organised units of the Soviet Western Army entered the city. In response, the Polish Army started sending units eastwards to help the self-defence units, while the Soviets did the same but in the opposite direction. Open conflict seemed inevitable. On January 12 Soviet High Command declared the goal of its \\"Target Vistula\\" operation: deep scouting towards the Neman River. On February 12 that goal was updated to include the Bug river.(Davies, p. 12) On that day Jukums VƒÅcietis ordered the new Western Command to carry out a \\"reconnaissance in depth\\" as far as Tilsit, Brest- Litovsk, Kowel and Rivne. He also ordered the securing of main railway junctions, including those in Vilna, Lida, Baranowicze and Luninets.(Davies, p. 39) Among the aims of the Bolsheviks was to drive through eastern and central Europe and support the Revolutions in Germany and Austria- Hungary.(Davies, p. 29) The Bolshevik forces did not anticipate serious opposition on the way and saw the states of Poland, Belarus and Lithuania as mere ephemerides, unable to defend their own \\"temporary\\" borders. However, it is unlikely that the Soviets really expected to reach the Vistula. The military orders were full of propaganda. The main goal of the operation was likely to see how much territory could be opportunistically grabbed in the chaotic governmental flux caused by the after-effects of WW I in Europe's east before any serious independent governing authorities arose. (Davies, p. 12 and p. 13) Finally, the first Polish-Soviet clashes happened in mid-February, in the area of the towns of Bereza Kartuska and Mosty, where both armies clashed in a series of skirmishes. The Soviet offensive came to a halt by late February and it became apparent that the Red Army would not break through the Polish lines by half-hearted attacks. Both the Soviet offensive and the Polish counterattack started at the same time, which resulted in an increasing number of troops being brought to the area. In April the Bolsheviks captured Grodno and Vilna, but were soon pushed out by the Polish counteroffensive. =Romanian direction= In early 1918, Bessarabia, a former Russian province, united with Romania after two months of independence as the Moldavian Democratic Republic. The Soviet did not accept the union and tried to retake the region by force. However, it all amounted to several sporadic attacks along the Dniester river. The Russians also attacked in order to support Communist Hungary, who also had a war with Romania. It was to no avail, as the region was successfully defended against Bolshevik attacks. Aftermath The Estonian and Polish armies proved to be far more capable opponents than the Red Army had assumed. The Pskov Offensive of the Estonian Petseri Battle Group destroyed the Estonian Red Army, captured Pskov and expelled Soviet forces from the territory between Estonia and the Velikaya River on 25 May. The 7th and 15th Red Armies began a counteroffensive in Ingria and in the north of Pskov in July 1919, which regained most of the lost territories of Petrograd and Pskov regions. With weapons provided by Britain and France and operational support by the Estonian Army and the Royal Navy, the White Russian Northwestern Army began Offensive White Sword on 28 September 1919 with the aim of capturing Petrograd. The Northwestern Army approached to within of the city, but the 7th Red Army repulsed the White Russian troops, driving them back into Estonia. Although the orders for the \\"Target Vistula\\" operation were never withdrawn, the Soviet plans were soon made obsolete by growing Polish resistance and eventually by the Polish counter-offensive in April. Unable to accomplish their objectives, the Red Army withdrew from their positions and started a reorganisation. The Polish-Soviet War had begun. Historiography The best known comprehensive historical analysis of the campaign against Poland was performed by Norman Davies in his book White Eagle, Red Star (1972). Davies mentioned the codename for this offensive: \\"Target Vistula\\"; however, it is not commonly used in historiography.Norman Davies in his book claims that \\"Target Vistula\\" (\\"–¶–µ–ª—å ‚Äì –í–∏—Å–ª–∞\\" or similar) was the Soviet codename of the offensive. This term, however, is mostly absent in Polish and Soviet historiography of the period. In this association one may notice the title \\"An Expedition beyond Vistula\\" (Pokhod za Vislu) of Tukhachevsky's memoirs about his Polish campaign. Other translations of the offensive include Operation Vistula (from Polish Operacja Wis≈Ça). This name is used for example in or Andrzej Leszek Szczesniak, Wojna polsko-bolszewicka 1918‚Äì1920, THE SUMMIT TIMES, Vol. 9, Issue No. 28/2002. Please notice that the term \\"Operation Vistula\\" commonly refers to a totally different event.

History The Act became law after it was enacted by the United States Congress and signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on June 20, 1936. The Act's primary sponsor was Representative Jennings Randolph (D-WV). Senator Morris Sheppard (D-TX) was the bill's major sponsor in the United States Senate. The Act was amended and updated significantly in 1974, with then Senator Jennings Randolph pushing the legislation through Congress almost singlehandedly. Among the people and organizations working to amend the Act were Durward McDaniel, National Representative of the American Council of the Blind, Irving Schloss, with the American Foundation for the Blind, and John Nagle, with the National Federation of the Blind. The 1974 amendments became law on December 7, 1974. https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/chapter-6A With his Special Counsel on the Senate Labor and Public Welfare Committee, Robert Humphreys, Esq., Senator Randolph developed numerous innovations in the Randolph-Sheppard program by expanding opportunities for blind vendors; entitling blind vendors and their State licensing agencies to income from vending machines on all Federal property; providing full due process to aggrieved blind vendors which enables them to resolve disputes with State agencies through hearings, arbitrations, and Federal court appeals; the creation of elected committees of blind vendors in each state with a Randolph- Sheppard program which are responsible for representing all the blind vendors in a state; creating a priority (rather than the mere preference that existed prior to 1974) for the operation of blind vending facilities on all Federal property. It was hoped and expected at the time the 1974 amendments became law that the blind vending facility program could double in size within five years. That hope was optimistic, and a number of impediments to the program's progress have emerged over the years. Senator Randolph was the Chairman of the Subcommittee on the Handicapped of the Senate Labor and Public Welfare Committee, and was responsible for the enactment of other important legislation to improve the lives of people with disabilities, including the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Education of All Handicapped Children Act. Operation and management of the Randolph-Sheppard Program The Randolph- Sheppard program operates in nearly every State through State licensing agencies as directed in the Code of Federal Regulations http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text- idx?c=ecfr&tpl;=/ecfrbrowse/Title34/34cfr395_main_02.tpl. National management and support are provided under the law by the Rehabilitation Services Administration in the Department of Education. There are some 2,500 blind vendors operating throughout the United States, managing businesses that run the gamut of food service and vending, from snack bars, gift shops, cafeterias, and highway rest stop vending operations, to major food service operations through military dining contracts. The gross national revenue from such operations now exceeds $800 million annually. (See RS-15 Reports issued by the Department of Education, Rehabilitation Services Administration.

The academy specialises in Maths and Computing. History =Grammar school= Originally called Apsley Grammar School, it began as a state grammar school in Hemel Hempstead. It was founded in 1955 as part of the development of the town after its designation as a new town and the need for expanded secondary school provision. Although named for the nearby village of Apsley the school is actually situated about one mile away, in the Bennetts End district of the town. Its first Head Teacher was Valentine (V.J.) Wrigley. =Comprehensive= The name of the school changed to Longdean School in 1970 on the amalgamation with the adjacent Bennett's End Secondary Modern School to form what was the third-largest comprehensive school in Hertfordshire at the time. The school motto of Rejoice in Thy Youth was retained after the amalgamation. Since September 2012 the headmaster has been Mr Graham Cunningham, replacing the previous headmaster, Mr Rhodri Bryant. The last Ofsted report classed the school as a 'GOOD'. A cashless catering system is operated where money can be credited onto students accounts which is scanned using their finger prints on biometric scanners. =Academy= During the summer term of 2011, Longdean School attained academy status. The school works in consortium with two neighbouring schools to enhance post-16 provision. The group consists of Adeyfield School, Astley Cooper School and Longdean School. Staff development and well-being are also coordinated at consortium level. In May 2012, Longdean was included in the Government's ¬£2 billion Priority School Building Programme. Longdean's inclusion was based upon the condition of its existing buildings that have exceeded their 25-year life expectancy. As a result, a completely new school building has been constructed by Interserve/Kajima on former playing fields and both the existing premises are to be demolished. The new school opened at the end of 2016.

Like other hookworms, it is a member of the phylum Nematoda. It is an obligatory parasitic nematode that lives in the small intestine of human hosts. Necatoriasis‚Äîa type of helminthiasis‚Äîis the term for the condition of being host to an infestation of a species of Necator. Since N. americanus and Ancylostoma duodenale (also known as Old World hookworm) are the two species of hookworms that most commonly infest humans, they are usually dealt with under the collective heading of \\"hookworm infection\\". They differ most obviously in geographical distribution, structure of mouthparts, and relative size. Necator americanus has been proposed as an alternative to Trichuris suis in helminthic therapy. Morphology This parasite has two dorsal and two ventral cutting plates around the anterior margin of the buccal capsule. It also has a pair of subdorsal and a pair of subventral teeth located close to the rear. Males are usually 7‚Äì9 mm long, whereas females are about 9‚Äì11 mm long. The typical lifespan of these parasites is 3‚Äì5 years. They can produce between 5,000 and 10,000 eggs per day. Habitat N. americanus is primarily found in tropical and temperate areas. This parasite thrives in warmer climates because to hatch, the eggs require a moist, warm, and shaded environment. The thin, smooth shells of this species cause the eggs and juveniles to die in freezing temperatures or with soil desiccation. Therefore, the type of soil where the parasite resides is also very important for their ideal living conditions. Ideal soil conditions tend to be in areas where water is able to drain at a standard pace, and the size of the soil particles is neither too large nor too small. That way, the degree of dampness, as well as the openings in the soil, allow the parasites to burrow to the surface and attach to the skin of their next host. High transmission rates seem to be congruent with the heavy rains and warm temperatures that are characteristic of tropical climates. One anomaly of this species is that it appears to prefer male hosts to female hosts, likely because of the division of labor in regions of its prevalence. Lifecycle Life cycle of N. americanus inside and outside of the human body This worm starts out as an unembryonated egg in the soil. After 24‚Äì48 hours under favorable conditions, the eggs become embryonated and hatch. This first juvenile stage 1 is known as 'rhabditiform'. The rhabditiform larvae grow and molt in the soil, transforming into a juvenile stage 2. The juvenile stage 2 molts once more until reaching the juvenile 3 stage, which is also called 'filariform'; this is also the infective form. The transformation from rhabditiform to the filariform usually takes 5-10 days.\\"Hookworm.\\" CDC Online. 4 Dec. 2009. http://www.dpd.cdc.gov/dpdx/HTML/Hookworm.htm . This larval form is able to penetrate human skin, travel through the blood vessels and heart, and reach the lungs. Once there, it burrows through the pulmonary alveoli and travels up the trachea, where it is swallowed and carried to the small intestine. There, it attaches to the intestinal wall, and matures into an adult and begins reproduction. Adults live in the lumen of the intestinal wall, where they cause blood loss to the host. The eggs produced by the adults end up on the soil after leaving the body through the feces; female hookworms produce up to 30,000 eggs per day. On average, most adult worms are eliminated in 1‚Äì2 years. The N. americanus lifecycle only differs slightly from that of A. duodenale. N. americanus has no development arrest in immune hosts and it must migrate through the lungs. Pathogenesis and symptoms The pathology of N. americanus is divided into two stages ‚Äì larvae and adults. The larvae penetrate the uninfected skin and travel through various organs, including the respiratory tract and lymph nodes. Once in the lymph nodes, the larvae start entering the blood, lungs, and intestines. Some larvae cannot readily enter the dermis and remain trapped in the skin, causing skin irritation and cutaneous larva migrans. Other symptoms include excessive coughing and dyspnea (short of breath) during larval migration. Once attached to the intestinal wall, N. americanus resides and matures into adults, penetrates blood vessels, and sucks blood. The incubation process of the larvae begins once entered into the small intestine; therefore, symptoms may not arise for up to 40 days, but this is variable from person to person. Blood loss from sites of intestinal attachment may cause iron-deficiency anemia and protein loss. One individual N. americanus can cause 30 Œºl of blood loss per day. Iron-deficiency anemia can cause mental retardation and growth insufficiency in children. Further, infected patients experience abdominal pain (exacerbated by meals) with diarrhea, bloating, and nausea.  Epidemiology  In the United States, 95% of human hookworm cases are caused by N. americanus, primarily in young school children in economically deprived rural areas. Juveniles cannot survive freezing temperatures, so the highest prevalence occurs in areas with warmer temperatures and greater rainfall. The greatest incidence of infections occurs in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, especially in poverty-stricken areas with poor sanitation. A. duodenale infections occur at a lesser rate and are seen primarily in Europe and the Mediterranean. Genome A draft assembly of the genome of Necator americanus has been sequenced and analyzed. It comprises 244 Mbp with 19,151 predicted protein-coding genes; these include genes whose products mediate the hookworm's invasion of the human host, genes involved in blood feeding and development, genes encoding proteins that represent new potential drug targets against hookworms, and expanded gene families encoding likely immunomodulator proteins, whose products may be beneficial in treating inflammatory diseases and asthma. Diagnostics The most common method for diagnosing N. americanus is through identification of eggs in a fecal sample using a microscope. N. americanus eggs have a thin shell and are oval shaped, measuring roughly 56‚Äì74 by 36‚Äì40 Œºm. Treatments and medications =Anthelmintic drugs= The most common treatment for N. americanus infection are benzimidazoles, specifically albendazole and mebendazole. Benzimidazoles kill adult worms by binding to the nematode‚Äôs Œ≤-tubulin and subsequently inhibiting microtubule polymerization within the parasite. The efficacy of single-dose treatments for hookworm infections were: 72% for albendazole, 15% for mebendazole, and 31% for pyrantel pamoate. A current concern with this parasite is the increase in drug resistance, such as benzimidazoles and mebendazoles. Pregnant women should not be treated within their first trimester. Prevention and control Infection and transmission of others can be prevented by not defecating outdoors or using human feces as fertilizer. This parasite is not transmittable directly from person to person. Pigs may be an intermediate host for N. americanus. Economic burden N. americanus causes hookworm diseases, which are associated with blood loss and anemia. Patients who are infected with around 25 to 100 worms experience symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss, and slight headaches. As the infestation number reaches 100 to 500 worms, the patient experiences extreme fatigue, iron deficiency, and abdominal pain. The symptoms worsen and result in possible death when the infestation reaches over 500 hookworms. Children and pregnant women affected by N. americanus are at greater risk due to anemia and the greater need for dietary iron and protein. The demand is high for an improvement of sanitation to reduce fecal contamination in regions with high prevalence of N. americanus infections. The current control strategies include a combination of mass drug administration for children at age 4‚Äì6 years to prevent or eliminate N. americanus infections.

Two different groups of Harbingers appeared in the comic book series Harbinger.  History  When Solar recreated the world that became known as the Valiant Universe, a number of super-powered beings emerged. The most notable of those were Harbingers, human beings with a wide range of psionic powers. Throughout history, their powers tended to lie dormant, emerging in occasional bursts that were usually brought on by stress. That changed when Toyo Harada, a Japanese-born Harbinger, established the Harbinger Foundation. He hoped to study the Harbingers and the full extent of their powers. He discovered that he was what he dubbed an Omega Harbinger, a Harbinger who possessed a full range of Harbinger potential, and could activate the latent powers of other Harbingers. Harada decided to use his powers and resources to change the world for the better, no matter the cost. He began recruiting other Harbingers and creating programs to teach them how to better use their powers. The most skilled recruits became Eggbreakers, Harada's elite enforcers charged with containing renegade Harbingers, among other things. In the early 1990s, the Harbinger Foundation discovered the existence of Peter Stanchek, the only other Omega Harbinger that existed at the time. Harada hoped that he would become a valuable ally. However, Pete discovered the truth behind Harada's ultimate plan after his close friend, who was outspoken against the Harbinger Foundation and their methods, was murdered by Harada's assassins and an attempt was made to kill Pete Stanchek as well. Stanchek fled the Foundation, taking his girlfriend with him, and decided to stop the Harbinger Foundation from reaching its goals. To that end, they recruited other Harbingers, and undermined Harada's plans in any way they could.

He is introduced in issue 3 of Harbinger when he is recruited by the team to break into Harada's protected files. Although they sense his moral ambiguity, Sting activated his Harbinger power. After a disastrous caper on the dark side of the moon, the team learn that Ax cannot be trusted and Sting considers taking his powers away. Ultimately they decide to leave him with his powers, though they understood the risk he posed. Ax then embarked on a life of crime, which brought him into conflict with both Bloodshot and XO Manowar. Although he wasn't able to steal their technology, Ax's powers continued to grow and he found himself in a race with Harada to acquire the \\"blood of heroes\\" (the nanites in Bloodshot's blood). Ax killed Bloodshot on a moonbase in 2028. His time with the blood of heroes was short, but he copied his personality into a hidden computer file within the nanites before being killed by Harada's troops.

Course The Kissimmee River arises in Osceola County as the outflow from East Lake Tohopekaliga, passing through Lake Tohopekaliga, Lake Cypress, Lake Hatchineha and Lake Kissimmee. Below Lake Kissimmee, the river forms the boundary between Osceola County and Polk County, between Highlands County and Okeechobee County, and between Glades County and Okeechobee County before it flows into Lake Okeechobee. The river was originally in length, of which was between Lake Kissimmee and Lake Okeechobee. It forms the headwaters of the Kissimmee River-Lake Okeechobee-Everglades ecosystem. The Kissimmee River watershed of is adjacent to the Eastern Continental Divide, with triple watershed points at the Miami (north), Withlacoochee (northwest), and Peace (west) rivers' watersheds and the Lake Okeechobee watershed (southwest). The floodplain of the river supports a diverse community of waterfowl, wading birds, fish, and other wildlife. Flood control The 1947 Atlantic hurricane season, which included the 1947 Fort Lauderdale Hurricane and the 1947 October Hurricane, produced very heavy rainfall and flooding over most of central and southern Florida. Florida requested federal assistance in controlling future floods, and in 1954 the United States Congress authorized the canalization of the Kissimmee River. From 1962 to 1970 the United States Army Corps of Engineers dredged the C-38 Canal down the Kissimmee valley, shortening the distance from Lake Kissimmee to Lake Okeechobee to just . It has since been realized that this project damaged the river, with the faster water flow leading to major environmental problems in the Kissimmee Valley and Lake Okeechobee. Efforts are currently underway to reverse the process and re- introduce the many oxbows in the river that slowed the water.Hinnant, Lee. 1990. Kissimmee River. in Marth, Del and Marty Marth, eds. The Rivers of Florida. Sarasota, Florida: Pineapple Press. . Effects of channelization After the river channel was straightened, of floodplain below Lake Kissimmee dried out, reducing the quality of waterfowl habitat by ninety percent, and the number of herons, egrets and wood storks by two-thirds. Catches of largemouth bass in the river were consistently worse after the channelization. While the Kissimmee was not a significant source of pollution for Lake Okeechobee before channelization, in the 1970s and later the river contributed about 25% of the nitrogen and 20% of the phosphorus flowing into the lake. References in popular culture In protest to the canalization of the river and its resultant damage to the habitat, Florida author Piers Anthony based the plot of the tenth Xanth novel, Vale of the Vole, around the straightening of the \\"Kiss-Mee River,\\" an obvious parody to \\"Kissimmee.\\" The river was mentioned in a lyric of Josh Turner's song \\"Alligator Stroll\\". Restoration backfilled to restore the Kissimmee River floodplain to a more natural state Efforts to restore the Kissimmee River to its original flow were approved by Congress in 1992, and began with modification to the headwater lakes in 1997. The United States Army Corps of Engineers had initially hoped to complete the project in 2015. In 2006, the South Florida Water Management District had acquired enough land along the river and in the upper chain of lakes to complete restoration. In all, of the Kissimmee River will be restored. A 2009 report from the Corps of Engineers went into detail with the issues and plans for the Kissimmee River restoration. Already, wildlife is returning to the restored sections of river. When flooding began again, muck and smothering aquatic weeds were flushed out. Sandbars reemerged. Encroaching dry land trees began dying back. Once-dormant plants began to reestablish themselves. The species included pink-tipped smartweed, horsetail, sedges, rushes, arrowhead, duck potato and pickerel weed. Flooding and continuous flow increased levels of dissolved oxygen in the water, creating near perfect conditions for aquatic invertebrates such as insects, mollusks, works, crayfish and freshwater shrimp. This, in turn, boosted fish populations and it led to a rise in bird and alligator populations. The entire food chain benefitted. This is one reason that the Kissimmee River restoration is considered to be the largest true ecosystem restoration project in the world, attracting ecologists from other states and countries.Alderson, Doug. 2009.

It was purchased in 1896 for ¬£10. The house lies adjacent to the Church of St. Andrew. It is a Grade II* listed building. History Detail of oak leaf. The house is a 14th-century Wealden hall house. Although the name reflects the fact that the parish priest and his housekeeper used it, the house was originally built as a farmer's house. It is a very modest property -- not at all like the grand rectories that many Church of England clergy occupied by the 19th century. It is a low-ceilinged, two-storey, timber-framed building with a thatched roof. Part of the house was rebuilt in the 17th century. It is commonly said that a detail on a cornice wood carving of an oak leaf, may have inspired the National Trust's emblem, but there is no evidence to prove that claim. It has a rare chalk and sour milk floor. Outside there is a small but well-planted cottage garden, which was designed by Graham Stuart Thomas. The house is open to the public. =National Trust= The 1895 decision by the National Trust about the approach to adopt to the repair and presentation of the Clergy House was critical in shaping its subsequent way of dealing with almost all its properties, which continues to this day. It was also influential in promoting more widely a much more conservative attitude to the restoration of historic buildings than had been common practice in the 19th century..\\"The National Trust. The Next Hundred Years. Ed. Howard Newby. National Trust 1995. . This was a direct result of the close links between the newly formed National Trust and the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings (SPAB). The SPAB had been founded by William Morris 18 years earlier as a protest against excessive restoration which robbed buildings of their true value and interest. The early Founders of the Trust knew William Morris and were equally horrified by the damage that had been done, mostly to churches, in the name of restoration.\\"From William Morris. Building Conservation and the Arts and Crafts Cult of Authenticity 1877-1939. Ed. Chris Miele.Yale University Press. New Haven & London. 2005. The Clergy House was severely derelict in 1890 when the new vicar, the Reverend F. W. Beynon, sought advice on its repair from a London architect, Owen Fleming. In 1891 Beynon contacted the SPAB for advice SPAB Archives and after ¬£124 was raised by appeal some work was undertaken. But the project got into difficulties. In July 1894 Beynon asked the SPAB for its view of the nascent, but unknown, National Trust to see if it might be interested in taking on the Clergy House. The SPAB put him in touch with Canon Rawnsley, one of the National Trust's founders. Before the Trust decided to acquire the building another founder of the Trust, Octavia Hill, contacted the Society for advice. In her letter she said that they \\"will be asked to 'restore' it, so far as that odious word means preserve from decay of course we should wish to do so.\\" This dislike of damaging 19th century restoration practices was confirmed by the National Trust committee in March 1895 when it resolved that \\"restoration means such work as may be necessary to the preservation of the building with as little new work as possible.\\" This set the pattern for all its later acquisitions. Centenary sundial, Alfriston Clergy House 1896-1996 In June the Ecclesiastical Commissioners agreed to sell the building for ¬£10. Octavia Hill then asked the SPAB to recommend an architect \\"who could be there himself whose heart was in the matter and who could decide point by point on the spot what to do and see it being done, with knowledge of art and craft.\\" This was entirely in line with SPAB's views about the best and most careful way to repair an old building. The SPAB suggested Alfred Powell, who undertook the repairs, though the National Trust's first ever appeal for funds proved disappointing. As a result of this early co- operation the National Trust and SPAB developed a close working relationship which continues to this day. Over the years many of its properties from country houses to cottages have been repaired by architects trained by the SPAB, and working to the conservation principles put into practice at the Clergy House.

Deeply in love with Portugal, he was an expert, critic and translator of the works of Fernando Pessoa from whom he drew the conceptions of saudade, of fiction and of the heteronyms. Tabucchi was first introduced to Pessoa's works in the 1960s when attending the Sorbonne. He was so charmed that when he returned to Italy, he took an introductory course in Portuguese for a better comprehension of the poet. His books and essays have been translated in 18 countries, including Japan. Together with his wife, Mar√≠a Jos√© de Lancastre, he translated many works by Pessoa into Italian and has written a book of essays and a comedy about the writer. Tabucchi was awarded the French prize \\"M√©dicis √©tranger\\" for Indian Nocturne (Notturno indiano) and the premio Campiello, and the Aristeion Prize for Sostiene Pereira. In later life he was mentioned as a contender for the Nobel Prize in Literature, a feat he never achieved. Early life Antonio Tabucchi was born in Pisa but grew up at his maternal grandparents' home in Vecchiano, a nearby village. During his years at university, he travelled widely around Europe on the trail of the authors he had encountered in his uncle's library. During one of these journeys, he found the poem \\"Tabacaria\\" (tobacco shop) in a bookstall near the Gare de Lyon in Paris, signed by √Ålvaro de Campos, one of the pen names of the Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa. It was in the French translation by Pierre Hourcade. The book was a major influence on his writing life for at least twenty years. A visit to Lisbon sparked his love of the city of the fado and of that country as a whole. As a result, he graduated in 1969 with a thesis on \\"Surrealism in Portugal\\". He specialized at the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa in the seventies and in 1973 he was appointed as teacher of Portuguese Language and Literature in Bologna. That year he wrote his first novel, Piazza d'Italia (Bompiani 1975), in which he tried to describe history from the losers' point of view, in this case the Tuscan anarchists, in the tradition of great Italian writers of a more or less recent past, such as Giovanni Verga, Federico De Roberto, Giuseppe Tomasi Di Lampedusa, Beppe Fenoglio, and contemporary authors, like Vincenzo Consolo. Career In 1978, he was appointed to the University of Genoa, and published Il piccolo naviglio, followed by Il gioco del rovescio e altri racconti in 1981, and Donna di porto Pim (1983). His first important novel, Indian Nocturne, was published in 1984, and became the basis of a 1989 film directed by Alain Corneau. The protagonist tries to trace a friend who has disappeared in India but is actually searching for his own identity. He published Piccoli equivoci senza importanza in 1985 and, the next year, Il filo dell'orizzonte. This novel features another protagonist (Spino) on a quest to discover something (here, the identity of a corpse) but who is also looking for his own identity‚Äîwhich was to become a common mission for Tabucchi protagonists. Whether these characters succeed in the attempt is uncertain, but they are compelled to face their image as mirrored by others. A film was drawn from this book in 1993, directed by the Portuguese Fernando Lopes. In 1987, when I volatili del Beato Angelico and Pessoana Minima were published, he received France's Prix M√©dicis for best foreign novel (Notturno indiano). The next year he wrote the comedy I dialoghi mancati. The President of Portugal appointed him the title Do Infante Dom Henrique in 1989, and that same year the French government named him a Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres. Tabucchi published Un baule pieno di gente. Scritti su Fernando Pessoa (Feltrinelli) in 1990, and the next year, L'angelo nero (1991). In 1991 he wrote in Portuguese Requiem: A Hallucination, a novel later translated into Italian (winner of Premio P.E.N. Club italiano) and he published Sogni di sogni. In 1994 he released Gli ultimi tre giorni di Fernando Pessoa, as well as the novel that brought him the most recognition: Sostiene Pereira, winner of the Prizes Super Campiello, Scanno and Jean Monnet for European Literature. The protagonist of this novel becomes the symbol of the defence of freedom for information for the political opponents of all anti-democratic regimes. In Italy, during the election campaign, the opposition against the controversial communication magnate Silvio Berlusconi aggregated around this book. The director Roberto Faenza drew from it the eponymous film (1995) in which he cast Marcello Mastroianni as Pereira and Daniel Auteuil as Dr. Cardoso. In 1997 Tabucchi wrote the novel The Missing Head of Damasceno Monteiro (La testa perduta di Damasceno Monteiro) based on the true story of a man whose headless corpse was found in a park. It was discovered that the man had been murdered in a police station of the Republican National Guard (GNR). The news story struck the writer's sensitivity and imagination. The event's setting in Porto also gave the author the opportunity to show his love for the city. In order to finish this novel, Tabucchi worked on the documents gathered by the investigators at the Council of Europe in Strasbourg who enforce civil rights and the conditions of detention in Europe, including the relationship between citizens and police. The novel proved prophetic when police Sergeant Jos√© dos Santos later confessed the murder, was convicted and sentenced to 17 years' imprisonment. Also in 1997, Tabucchi wrote Marconi, se ben mi ricordo, followed the next year by L'Automobile, la Nostalgie et l'Infini (1998). That year the Leibniz Academy awarded him the Prize Nossack. He wrote Gli Zingari e il Rinascimento and Ena poukamiso gemato likedes (Una camicia piena di macchie. Conversazioni di A.T. con Anteos Chrysostomidis) in 1999. In 2001 Tabucchi published the epistolary novel, Si sta facendo sempre pi√π tardi (English translation, 2006: It's Getting Later All the Time). In it, 17 letters which celebrate the triumph of the word, which like \\"messages in the bottle\\", have no addressee, they are missives the author addressed to an \\"unknown poste restante\\". The book received the 2002 Prize France Culture (the French cultural radio) for foreign literature. He used to spend six months of the year in Lisbon, with his wife, a native of the city, and their two children. The rest of the year he spent in Tuscany, where he taught Portuguese literature at the University of Siena. Tabucchi considered himself a writer only in an ontological sense, because from the existential point of view he was glad to define himself as a \\"university professor\\". For Tabucchi, literature was not a profession, \\"but something that involves desires, dreams and imagination\\".Antonio Tabucchi, un dubitatore impegnato. Interview by Asbel Lopez. Tabucchi regularly contributed articles to the cultural pages of the newspapers Corriere della Sera and El Pa√≠s. Death Tabucchi died in a hospital in Lisbon on 25 March 2012, after a long battle with cancer. (obituary) He was 68. Honors In 2007, he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Li√®ge. The Portuguese government named him Commander of the Order of Prince Henry on 7 April 1989. In 1989, the French government named him Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres. In 2004, he was awarded the Francisco de Cerecedo journalism prize, granted by the Association of European Journalists and bestowed by Spain's then heir to the throne, Felipe, Prince of Asturias, now King Felipe VI, in recognition of the quality of his journalistic work and his outspoken defence of freedom of expression.2004 Francisco de Cerecedo Journalism Prize Works * Piazza d'Italia (1975), * Il piccolo naviglio (1978) * Il gioco del rovescio e altri racconti (1981, short story collection), * Donna di Porto Pim (1983) * Indian Nocturne (Notturno indiano, 1984) * Little Misunderstandings of No Importance (Piccoli equivoci senza importanza, 1985, short story collection), * Il filo dell'orizzonte (1986, short story collection), * The Flying Creatures of Fra Angelico (I volatili del Beato Angelico, 1987) * Pessoana m√≠nima (1987) * I dialoghi mancati (1988), * Un baule pieno di gente.

It was released for the Sega Genesis in Japan in April 1990, and worldwide the following year. It is the third game in the original Phantasy Star series, and is a distant sequel to the previous games, with the connections to those games not being immediately obvious. However, gameplay is similar to the previous games, with turn-based combat and random encounters. Players explore various overworld maps and dungeons in order to progress through the game. It was later re- released on the Virtual Console, and also for various emulated retro collections such as the Phantasy Star Collection, Sega Genesis Collection, and Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection.  Gameplay  Phantasy Star III mostly follows the traditional roleplaying game formula seen throughout the series, with the exploration of several 2-D worlds, character recruitment, and random enemy encounters using a turn-based battle system. Unlike previous games, the \\"technique\\" magic system plays a somewhat diminished role in combat. New features in the combat system include the auto-battle feature and the icon- based menu system. The feature that mostly separates Phantasy Star III, however, is that the story spans three generations of characters. At critical points throughout the game, the main character is given the option of marrying one of two women he has encountered during his travels. This choice determines the new main character of the next generation‚Äîthe child (or children) of the previous lead. The choice also affects the gameplay, as the main character may be Orakian or a mix of Layan and Orakian, which differ in their ability to use techniques and their level of proficiency with them. Two paths in the second generation in turn lead to four paths in the third and final generation, and depending on which of the four main characters is played, the ending will vary.  Plot  Phantasy Star III appears at first to take place in a medieval fantasy setting, in contrast to the science-fiction settings of previous games. A thousand years before the start of the game, two factions -- one led by the swordsman Orakio, the other by the sorceress Laya -- were engaged in a bitter conflict. An attempt at peace was made when the two leaders met for an armistice, but soon afterwards they both mysteriously vanished. This placed the two factions in a precarious situation, as each blamed the other for their leader's disappearance. All communication between the Orakians and Layans was suspended, travel between their respective worlds was prohibited, and the two groups teetered on the brink of war. Players take control of Rhys, Crown Prince of the Orakian kingdom of Landen, on the day of his wedding to Maia, a mysterious amnesiac who washed up on Landen's shore two months earlier. During the ceremony, a dragon -- identified as a Layan -- suddenly appears and snatches Maia, in what seems to be an overt escalation of the Layan-Orakian conflict. During Rhys's search for Maia, he recruits various characters to his cause. Ultimately, it is revealed that Maia herself is Layan -- Princess of the kingdom of Cille -- and that her kidnapping was actually a rescue attempt by her people, who believed she had been stolen from them by the \\"hostile\\" Orakians.  Development  The game was developed and published by Sega for the Sega Genesis, where it first released in Japan in April 1990 and in North America in July 1991. Producer Kazunari Tsukamoto described Phantasy Star III as being similar to a collection of side stories when compared to the connected narrative of its predecessor and the sequel Phantasy Star IV: The End of the Millennium. This and its altered graphic style was due to the team being different from earlier Phantasy Star entries. Hirondo Saiki acted as game designer. The game's multiple endings proved difficult to implement due to data storage limitations. The branching narrative and gameplay paths were added to set the game apart from other role-playing games (RPGs) due to the crowded market at the time. The game was the first time designers and programmers came together as a team rather than separate units, but Saiki became fatigued during development of the game's later stages due to being sole designer. In order to realise the planned scale of the world, several portions of the narrative needed to be cut. Character designs and the cover art were done by Saru Miya, who remembered experiencing great hardships with the project, describing it as something which she considered a \\"home- spun\\" project. The music for Phantasy Star III was composed by Izuho Numata, who had only been at Sega for two years. She later claimed that the project was challenging due to her lack of experience with composing for RPGs.  Reception  Praise was given to Phantasy Star III for its unique \\"generational\\" gameplay and characters. Others thought it was just too \\"different\\" in style from its peers. Critics cite the only subtle differences between the endings, lower quality battle animations, and the fact that it did not resolve the perceived cliffhanger ending of Phantasy Star II. Still, it maintains above average ratings, with an overall score of 70% on the aggregate site GameRankings. Computer Gaming World in 1991 praised the game's graphics and its \\"plenty of plot twists and turns\\". The magazine concluded that it was \\"a rewarding epic tale which should be told on every Genesis system\\". The game was reviewed that year in Dragon #176 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \\"The Role of Computers\\" column. The reviewers gave the game 4 out of 5 stars. They noted that they \\"didn't like it as much as Phantasy Star II\\" but still praised Phantasy Star III for being \\"creative in many ways,\\" including the choices of whom to marry, the different possible endings, and the \\"longer play life\\" that this allows. Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the game a score of 8 out of 10. Nintendo Power named it the series' \\"lackluster third installment\\" and noted that series co-creator Rieko Kodama did not work on it.Editors of Nintendo Power: Nintendo Power February 2009; issue 2 (in English). Future US Inc, 39-42. Retrieved February 1, 2010. The game's icon-based menu system later inspired a similar menu system in Shining in the Darkness (1991).

It is the administrative center of the Byaroza District.  History  The village of Biaroza (meaning birch) was first mentioned in 1477 as part of the Slonim paviet. In the 15th century, the village probably received the town charter. Between 1538 and 1600 it was an important centre of Calvinism. Later the town became the private property of the Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç family. =In the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth= In the 17th century, the village belonged to Sapieha family, who founded a fortified monastery and a palace here. In 1648, the monastery was presented to the Carthusian monks, who came from the Italian town of Treviso and settled here. In gratitude for this deed, Pope Alexander VII granted the title of a prince to Lew Sapieha. The monastery was also expanded and became one of the biggest charterhouses (Carthusian monasteries) in the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. The Carthusian order gave its name to the second part of the town's name in the form in which it has been used till late 1940s: Biaroza-Kartuzskaya (Polish: Bereza Kartuska). Byaroza monastery, a picture by Napoleon Orda During the Great Northern War, the monastery housed a conference held by King Augustus II of Poland and Peter I of Russia. In 1706, the fortified monastery was put under siege and then taken by assault and looted by the forces of Charles XII of Sweden. Two years later, the Swedish forces looted the area again, which resulted in almost total depopulation of the town. It was also damaged by the armies of Alexander Suvorov in 1772, during the Partitions of Poland. Kadia Molodowsky, Jewish poet and writer born in Byaroza =Under Russian rule= After the partitions, the town and the monastery were annexed by Russia in 1795. After the November Uprising of 1831 the town was captured by the Russian armies and then looted. The monastery was closed by tsarist authorities and in 1866, after the January Uprising, the whole complex was partially demolished, and the bricks were used for construction of a Russian prison and barracks nearby. The baroque church was destroyed in 1868. After the uprising, the town became a part of the so-called Pale of settlement and was repopulated with Jews expelled from other areas of the Russian Empire. By the 20th century, they constituted more than 70% of the city's inhabitants. In 1842, a new road was opened between Moscow and Warsaw and passed through the town, which started a period of economic prosperity. In 1871, a Warsaw-Moscow railroad was laid only from the town, connecting the town with the nearby major cities of Brest and Minsk. In 1878, the town had a marketplace, 7 streets and approximately 200 houses. Both the town and the adjoining area had approximately 5,000 inhabitants. Apart from the Catholic and Uniate Churches, there was also a synagogue, Jewish baths and a market just outside the city limits. =In the 20th century= In 1915, during the First World War, the town was occupied by the Imperial Germany and in 1918 claimed by the short- lived Belarusian People's Republic. The town was captured by the Red Army on January 19, 1919, during the Soviet westward offensive of 1918‚Äì19 (Target- Vistula). Within one month, the Polish Army reclaimed the area, and recaptured the town on February 14, 1919. During the Polish-Bolshevik War the town became a notable location of two major battles including the war's very first and the second Battle of Bereza Kartuska (1920). At the end of the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War the town was ceded to Poland in the Peace of Riga signed by the Soviet Russia (acting also on behalf of Soviet Belarus). The peace treaty remained in force until the Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939. = Polish prison = A Polish political prison camp was created in Bereza Kartuska in 1934. The former tsarist barracks and prison were turned into an internment camp for both Polish right-wing extremists from the ONR, Ukrainian separatists from the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists and members of the Communist Party of Poland and the Communist Party of Western Ukraine, and later also for members of opposition parties, journalists critical of the government and people suspected of common crimes. Inmates were sent there for up to three months without involvement of the courts, based solely on the administrative decision of the police or the voivode. In this way many Belarusians who resisted Polonization found themselves in the Bereza Kartuska camp.Jan Zaprudnik, \\"Belarus: At a Crossroads\\" (1993, ), p. 85 The legal basis for the camp opening was openly questioned and its existence was often criticized by opponents of the Sanacja movement, which from its inception called it a \\"concentration camp\\". This term was later popularized by post-war Communist propaganda, which depicted it as proof that the government of Poland was a Fascist regime. The camp was closed in September 1939, during the invasion of Poland. = After 1939 = In 1939 the town was captured by the Red Army and incorporated into the Byelorussian SSR. After the outbreak of the German- Soviet War, the town was captured by the German Army on 23 June 1941. German occupation lasted until 15 July 1944. During this time, Byaroza was administered as a part of Generalbezirk Wolhynien und Podolien of Reichskommissariat Ukraine. During World War II, a ghetto was created in the town for Jews rushed there from the surrounding area. Under the Nazi German occupying administration ‚Äî which had merged Byaroza, along with most of western Polesia, into the Reichskommissariat Ukraine ‚Äî more than 8,000 people were killed in mass executions or were starved to death. Numerous pro-Soviet and pro-Ukrainian partisan units were active in the area around Byaroza before Red Army troops finally liberated the town on 15 July 1944. Repopulated with Belarusian and Russian peasants, the town was rebuilt after the destruction of World War II. After a minor building materials factory was opened in the town, another period of fast growth followed. During the postwar period a Soviet aviation military base was placed close to Biaroza. In 1958-1967 a hydroelectric power station was built in the Biaroza Raion. In 1991, after the dissolution of USSR, the town became part of the independent Republic of Belarus.

The XBM format is superseded by XPM, which first appeared for X11 in 1989. Format differ markedly from most image files in that they take the form of C source files. This means that they can be compiled directly into an application without any preprocessing steps, but it also makes them far larger than their raw pixel data. The image data is encoded as a comma-separated list of byte values, each written in the C hexadecimal notation, '0x13' for example, so that multiple ASCII characters are used to express a single byte of image information. XBM data consists of a series of static unsigned char arrays containing the monochrome pixel data. When the format was in common use, an XBM typically appeared in headers (.h files) which featured one array per image stored in the header. The following piece of C code exemplifies an XBM file: #define test_width 16 #define test_height 7 static unsigned char test_bits[] = { 0x13, 0x00, 0x15, 0x00, 0x93, 0xcd, 0x55, 0xa5, 0x93, 0xc5, 0x00, 0x80, 0x00, 0x60 }; In place of the usual image-file-format header, XBM files has two or four #define statements. The first two #defines specify the height and width of the bitmap in pixels. The second two, if any, specify the position of any hotspot within the bitmap. (In the case of bitmapped cursors, the \\"hotspot\\" refers to the position of the cursor \\"point\\", generally at 0,0.) XBM image data consists of a line of pixel values stored in a static array. Because a single bit represents each pixel (0 for white or 1 for black), each byte in the array contains the information for eight pixels, with the upper left pixel in the bitmap represented by the low bit of the first byte in the array. If the image width does not match a multiple of 8, the extra bits in the last byte of each row are ignored. Support Some web browsers support displaying XBM images as a holdover from the early days of the world wide web, when XBM was the minimal non-proprietary image file format. The Arena web browser had full support since version 0.3.34 (25 July 1997). XBM support was removed from Internet Explorer 6, Mozilla Firefox 3.6, and WebKit-based browsers. There is a strong indication that Chromium (and therefore, also, Google Chrome) does not support XBM. Documentation for Opera 2.12 and 6.0 indicates that XBM was at least previously supported. Some image viewers/converters, e.g., XnView, FFmpeg and IrfanView, support XBM. A 48√ó48 XBM can be converted to Ikon and eventually X-Face with Netpbm tools. Despite having been superseded by the XPM format, XBM is still used by some modern but lightweight window managers like Openbox to define simple button images in a window's title bar, such as the iconify/minimize, restore, and maximize buttons. XBM is also used in embedded processing (microControllers) to display Icons used in GUIs. ImageMagick supports converting images both to and from XBM. GIMP may be used to create or modify images using the XBM format, and also supports converting images to and from the XBM format.

Kismet will work with any wireless card which supports raw monitoring mode, and can sniff 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, and 802.11n traffic. The program runs under Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and Mac OS X. The client can also run on Microsoft Windows, although, aside from external drones (see below), there's only one supported wireless hardware available as packet source. Distributed under the GNU General Public License, Kismet is free software. Features Kismet differs from other wireless network detectors in working passively. Namely, without sending any loggable packets, it is able to detect the presence of both wireless access points and wireless clients, and to associate them with each other. It is also the most widely used and up to date open source wireless monitoring tool. An explanation of the headings displayed in Kismet. Kismet also includes basic wireless IDS features such as detecting active wireless sniffing programs including NetStumbler, as well as a number of wireless network attacks. Kismet features the ability to log all sniffed packets and save them in a tcpdump/Wireshark or Airsnort compatible file format. Kismet can also capture \\"Per-Packet Information\\" headers. Kismet also features the ability to detect default or \\"not configured\\" networks, probe requests, and determine what level of wireless encryption is used on a given access point. In order to find as many networks as possible, Kismet supports channel hopping. This means that it constantly changes from channel to channel non-sequentially, in a user-defined sequence with a default value that leaves big holes between channels (for example, 1-6-11-2-7-12-3-8-13-4-9-14-5-10). The advantage with this method is that it will capture more packets because adjacent channels overlap. Kismet also supports logging of the geographical coordinates of the network if the input from a GPS receiver is additionally available.  Server / Drone / Client infrastructure  Kismet has three separate parts. A drone can be used to collect packets, and then pass them on to a server for interpretation. A server can either be used in conjunction with a drone, or on its own, interpreting packet data, and extrapolating wireless information, and organizing it. The client communicates with the server and displays the information the server collects. Plugins With the updating of Kismet to -ng, Kismet now supports a wide variety of scanning plugins including DECT, Bluetooth, and others. Usage Kismet is used in a number of commercial and open source projects. It is distributed with Kali Linux. It is used for wireless reconnaissance, and can be used with other packages for an inexpensive wireless intrusion detection system.

McNamara is a 2003 American documentary film about the life and times of former U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara illustrating his observations of the nature of modern warfare. The film was directed by Errol Morris and features an original score by Philip Glass. The title derives from the military concept of the \\"fog of war\\" depicting the difficulty of making decisions in the midst of conflict. The film won the 2003 Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature and Independent Spirit Award for Best Documentary Feature. It was non- competitively screened at the Cannes Film Festival. In 2019, the film was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Film Registry for being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". Concept Using archival footage, United States Cabinet conversation recordings, and an interview of the then eighty-five-year-old Robert McNamara, The Fog of War depicts his life, from his birth during the First World War remembering the time American troops returned from Europe, to his service as an air force officer in World War II, to joining Ford Motor Company as one of the Whiz Kids, rising to become the company's president, before serving as Secretary of Defense for presidents Kennedy and Johnson (including his involvement in the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Vietnam War). In a 2004 appearance at U.C. Berkeley, Errol Morris said his inspiration for the documentary derived from McNamara's book (with James G. Blight), Wilson's Ghost: Reducing the Risk of Conflict, Killing, and Catastrophe in the 21st Century (2001).UC Berkeley News Morris originally approached McNamara for an interview for an hour-long television special. That was extended multiple times and Morris decided to make a feature film.Ryan, Tom. \\"Making History: Errol Morris, Robert McNamara and The Fog of War.\\" Senses of Cinema 31 (2004):. Sense of Cinema. Web. 4 Nov. 2013. Morris interviewed McNamara for some twenty hours; the two-hour documentary comprises eleven lessons from In Retrospect: The Tragedy and Lessons of Vietnam (1995). He posits, discourses upon, and propounds the lessons in the interview that is The Fog of War. Moreover, at the U.C. Berkeley event, McNamara disagreed with Morris's interpretations in The Fog of War, yet, on completion, McNamara supplemented the original eleven lessons with an additional ten lessons; they are in The Fog of War DVD. When asked to apply the eleven lessons from In Retrospect to the U.S. invasion of Iraq, McNamara refused, arguing that ex-secretaries of defense must not comment upon the incumbent defense secretary's policies. He suggested other people could apply the eleven lessons to the war in Iraq, but that he would not, noting that the lessons are about war in general, not a specific war. Plot The film focuses primarily on the interviews of former Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara, who was interviewed for about 20 hours by the director of the documentary, Errol Morris, through a special device called the \\"Interrotron\\" which projects images of interviewer and interviewee on two-way mirrors in front of their respective cameras so each appears to be talking directly to the other. Use of this device is intended to convey actual interaction with each other and direct eye contact with the viewer. In the interviews, McNamara talks about aspects of international security and how and by what means it can be influenced by circumstances. The documentary explores recent events in American history and also focuses on McNamara's life and how he rose from a humble American family to be a politician who achieved enormous power and influence. McNamara worked with presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson and with general Curtis LeMay, and had direct access to many governmental documents. His opinions, personal experiences and lessons learned while serving as a Secretary of Defense can provide the audience with an enlightening philosophy and outlook on American politics. The documentary covers important events such as World War II, Vietnam War, Cuban Missile Crisis, and many others that McNamara himself witnessed. McNamara is regarded as the \\"architect\\" of the Vietnam War; a war that cost an enormous number of lives against a foe whose resolve he seriously underestimated. McNamara's interview, along with archival footage, offers a close look at international security and the international relations of the US, and an insight into why certain conflicts occur and the lessons that can be learned from these conflicts. Reception Reviews for the film were very positive. The film holds an 87/100 on Metacritic and received an overall score of 98% on Rotten Tomatoes.Rotten Tomatoes: The Fog of War Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote, \\"Although McNamara is photographed through the Interrotron, the movie is far from offering only a talking head. Morris is uncanny in his ability to bring life to the abstract, and here he uses graphics, charts, moving titles and visual effects in counterpoint to what McNamara is saying.\\" The Fog of War Over the course of the documentary, Morris distills McNamara's philosophy of war into eleven basic tenets:.Morris, E., Williams, M., Ahlberg, J. B., Chappell, R., McNamara, R. S., Glass, P., @Radical.media (Firm),... Sony Pictures Classics (Firm),. (2004). The Fog of War: Eleven Lessons from the Life of Robert S. McNamara. Lesson #1: Empathize with your enemy. McNamara repeats this sentence several times throughout the documentary. He discusses the moment during the Cuban Missile Crisis when he and Kennedy were trying to keep the United States out of war but General Curtis LeMay wanted to invade Cuba. Kennedy discovered LeMay's obsession with nuclear weapons when focusing on the Laotian problem in 1961. Kennedy received two messages from Nikita Khrushchev during the Cuban Missile Crisis. McNamara refers to them as the \\"hard message\\" and the \\"soft message.\\" McNamara differentiated the two messages because the first message was informal, and the second message was formal and was broadcast around the world. McNamara stated the first message sounded like it came from a \\"drunk man or one under a lot of stress.\\" It stated if the United States guaranteed to not invade Cuba, the missiles would be taken out by Cuba. The second and \\"hard message\\" stated that if \\"you [United States] attack [Cuba] we're prepared to confront you with masses of military power.\\" Morris, E., Williams, M., Ahlberg, J. B., Chappell, R., McNamara, R. S., Glass, P., @Radical.media (Firm), ... Sony Pictures Classics (Firm),. (2004). The Fog of War: Eleven Lessons from the Life of Robert S. McNamara. Llewellyn Thompson, a former US ambassador to Moscow, urged Kennedy to respond to the soft message. Thompson knew Khrushchev personally and believed that Khrushchev wanted only to be able to tell Cuba he stopped an invasion from the US. Kennedy eventually changed his mind to agree with Thompson. Lesson #2: Rationality alone will not save us. McNamara emphasized it was luck that prevented nuclear war. Rational individuals like Kennedy, Khrushchev, and Castro came close to creating national destruction. McNamara states that the possibility of nuclear destruction still exists today. Lesson #3: There's something beyond one's self. This lesson was used to describe McNamara's private life. McNamara states that \\"there's something beyond one's self and a responsibility to society.\\", McNamara discussed when he started to court his wife, Margaret Craig, and had a child. Then the war came. McNamara was then promoted to the youngest assistant professor at Harvard. Lesson #4: Maximize efficiency. McNamara was brought back from the Eighth air force and assigned to the first B-29, 58th Bomb Wing flying planes. It was thought the B-29s could destroy targets much more efficiently and effectively. McNamara was in charge of analyzing bombing operations and how to make them more efficient. Lesson #5: Proportionality should be a guideline in war. McNamara talks about the proportions of cities destroyed in Japan by the US. McNamara compares destroyed cities of Japan to cities in the US before the dropping of the nuclear bomb. Tokyo, roughly the size of New York City, was 51% destroyed; Toyama, the size of Chattanooga, 99% destroyed; Nagoya, the size of Los Angeles, 40% destroyed; Osaka, the size of Chicago, 35% destroyed; Kobe, the size of Baltimore, 55% destroyed. Then, McNamara compares the proportionality of the war on Japan to being immoral. Lesson #6: Get the data. McNamara worked at Ford in an executive position and conducted studies on buyer demographics to accident reports to make cars safer. McNamara was later promoted to president of Ford and was the first person outside the family to hold that position. He quit only five weeks later because of a position offered to him by Kennedy. Kennedy had offered McNamara a position as the Secretary of Treasury which he declined and later accepted the position as the Secretary of Defense. Lesson #7: Belief and seeing are both often wrong. McNamara's affirmation (of Morris's relation) of lesson 7 to the Gulf of Tonkin incident:,\\"We see what we want to believe.\\" Lesson #8: Be prepared to reexamine your reasoning. McNamara believed even though the United States is the strongest nation in the world, it should never use that power unilaterally: \\"if we can't persuade nations with comparable values of the merit of our cause, we better reexamine our reasoning.\\" Lesson #9: In order to do good, you may have to engage in evil. \\"Recognize at times we have to engage in evil, but minimize it.\\" Lesson #10: Never say never. McNamara believed the responsibility for the Vietnam War is on the president and says that if Kennedy had lived, the situation would have been better. Lesson #11: You can't change human nature. McNamara talks about the \\"fog of war\\" by comparing it to the human mind and how it cannot be fully understood. Ten additional lessons from R.S. McNamara These topics were selected by McNamara to supplement the documentary; they are in the DVD's special features. # The human race will not eliminate war in this century, but we can reduce the brutality of war‚Äîthe level of killing‚Äîby adhering to the principles of a \\"Just War,\\" in particular to the principle of \\"proportionality.\\" # The indefinite combinations of human fallibility and nuclear weapons will lead to the destruction of nations. # We [the U.S.A.] are the most powerful nation in the world‚Äîeconomically, politically, and militarily‚Äîand we are likely to remain so for decades ahead. But we are not omniscient. If we cannot persuade other nations with similar interests and similar values of the merits of the proposed use of that power, we should not proceed unilaterally except in the unlikely requirement to defend directly the continental U.S., Alaska and Hawaii. # Moral principles are often ambiguous guides to foreign policy and defense policy, but surely we can agree that we should establish as a major goal of U.S. foreign policy and, indeed, of foreign policy across the globe: the avoidance, in this century, of the carnage‚Äî160 million dead‚Äîcaused by conflict in the 20th century. # We, the richest nation in the world, have failed in our responsibility to our own poor and to the disadvantaged across the world to help them advance their welfare in the most fundamental terms of nutrition, literacy, health and employment. # Corporate executives must recognize there is no contradiction between a soft heart and a hard head. Of course, they have responsibilities to stockholders, but they also have responsibilities to their employees, their customers and to society as a whole. # President Kennedy believed the primary responsibility of a president is to keep the nation out of war, if at all possible. # War is a blunt instrument by which to settle disputes between or within nations, and economic sanctions are rarely effective. Therefore, we should build a system of jurisprudence based on the International Court‚Äîthat the U.S. has refused to support‚Äîwhich would hold individuals responsible for crimes against humanity. # If we are to deal effectively with terrorists across the globe, we must develop a sense of empathy‚ÄîI don't mean \\"sympathy,\\" but rather \\"understanding\\"‚Äîto counter their attacks on us and the Western World. # One of the greatest dangers we face today is the risk that terrorists will obtain access to weapons of mass destruction as a result of the breakdown of the Non- Proliferation Regime. We in the U.S. are contributing to that breakdown. Robert McNamara's 11 lessons from Vietnam From Robert McNamara's 1995 book In Retrospect: The Tragedy and Lessons of Vietnam. # We misjudged then ‚Äî and we have since ‚Äî the geopolitical intentions of our adversaries ‚Ä¶ and we exaggerated the dangers to the United States of their actions. # We viewed the people and leaders of South Vietnam in terms of our own experience ‚Ä¶ We totally misjudged the political forces within the country. # We underestimated the power of nationalism to motivate a people to fight and die for their beliefs and values. # Our misjudgments of friend and foe, alike, reflected our profound ignorance of the history, culture, and politics of the people in the area, and the personalities and habits of their leaders. # We failed then ‚Äî and have since ‚Äî to recognize the limitations of modern, high-technology military equipment, forces, and doctrine. We failed, as well, to adapt our military tactics to the task of winning the hearts and minds of people from a totally different culture. # We failed to draw Congress and the American people into a full and frank discussion and debate of the pros and cons of a large-scale military involvement ‚Ä¶ before we initiated the action. # After the action got under way, and unanticipated events forced us off our planned course ‚Ä¶ we did not fully explain what was happening, and why we were doing what we did. # We did not recognize that neither our people nor our leaders are omniscient. Our judgment of what is in another people's or country's best interest should be put to the test of open discussion in international forums. We do not have the God-given right to shape every nation in our image or as we choose. # We did not hold to the principle that U.S. military action ‚Ä¶ should be carried out only in conjunction with multinational forces supported fully (and not merely cosmetically) by the international community. # We failed to recognize that in international affairs, as in other aspects of life, there may be problems for which there are no immediate solutions ‚Ä¶ At times, we may have to live with an imperfect, untidy world. # Underlying many of these errors lay our failure to organize the top echelons of the executive branch to deal effectively with the extraordinarily complex range of political and military issues.

It is the administrative center of Novhorod-Siverskyi Raion, though it is incorporated as a city of oblast significance and does not belong to the raion. Novhorod-Siverskyi is situated on the bank of the Desna River, 330 km from the capital, Kyiv, and 45 km south of the Russian border. Population: History The town was first chronicled in 1044. From 1098 it was the capital of the Siverian Principality, which served as a buffer zone against incursions of the Cumans (Polovtsy) and other steppe peoples. One of the numerous campaigns of local princes against the Cumans produced the great monument of early East Slavic literature, the Tale of Igor's Campaign. After the town's destruction by Mongols in 1239, it passed to the princes of Bryansk and then to the Grand Dukes of Lithuania. It was ruled by Dymitr Korybut (Kaributas), son of Algirdas. Muscovy obtained the area following the Battle of Vedrosha in 1503, but lost it to Poland after the Time of Troubles. Nowogr√≥d Siewierski was granted Magdeburg city rights in 1620 by Polish King Sigismund III Vasa. It was the easternmost powiat (county) seat of Poland. The town passed to Russia as a result of the Russo-Polish War (1654-1667). During the Cossack epoch, it received the status of military company town (sotenne misto) and later regimental town (polkove misto); these were military and administrative divisions in the Cossack army and country. Also Novhorod- Siverskyi became a cultural center of Left-bank Ukraine. It was made the capital of a separate namestnichestvo in 1782‚Äì97. Thereafter its importance steadily declined. During World War II, Novhorod-Siverskyi was occupied by the German Army from 26 August 1941 to 16 September 1943. Architecture Despite historic disasters, the town has preserved many architectural monuments, and a branch of the Chernihiv State Historical and Architectural Preserve has been established. The town has managed to keep random planning in its landscape. The boundary of the town historical center is vague. The tourist attractions are located on two high capes divided by ravines: the ensemble of Our Savior and Transfiguration Monastery and the town centre. The architectural monuments of state significance are scattered on five separate areas which compose the territory of the preserve. The biggest area is the territory of Our Savior and Transfiguration Monastery. The other areas are Uspensky (Dormition) Cathedral, the wooden St. Nicolas church, a triumphal arch, and shopping arcades. There are constructions and residential buildings from the 18th and 19th centuries in the town centre. The main point of interest in the town is the former residence of the Chernihiv metropolitans, the monastery of the Saviour's Transfiguration. It features a ponderous Neoclassical cathedral (1791‚Äì96, design by Giacomo Quarenghi), seventeenth-century stone walls, and several ecclesiastic foundations dating from the sixteenth century. Other landmarks include the Cossack Baroque Assumption cathedral, a triumphal arch (1787), and the wooden church of St. Nicholas (1760).

He was born in Newburn, Northumberland, son of the Rev Thomas Rickman and educated at Guildford Grammar School, Magdalen Hall, Oxford and Lincoln College, Oxford. The poet Robert Southey was one of his friends. From 1799 to 1801 he edited the Commercial, Agricultural, and Manufactures' Magazine which published his article \\"On ascertaining the population\\" in 1800. An earlier version of this paper entitled \\"Thoughts on the Utility and Facility of a general enumeration of the People of the British Empire\\". Rickman, was living at Burton in Christchurch, in 1792, when he first published ‚ÄòThoughts on the Utility and Facility . . . etc‚Äô. It was Christchurch‚Äôs MP George Rose who raised this in Parliament with the speaker Lord Colchester Charles Abbot, leading in 1800 to the Bill ‚ÄòAn Act for taking an Account of the Population of Great Britain‚Äô.Hampshire Magazine, Vol. 12 No. 2, December 1971, page 41 Shortly after, in 1800, Abbot appointed Rickman his Private Secretary. Rickman is credited with drafting the first bill which became the 1800 Census Act, the full title of which was An Act for taking an Account of the Population of Great Britain, and of the Increase or Diminution thereof, which became law in December 1800. Rickman was instrumental in carrying out the first four censuses of Great Britain, including not only a population count, but also the collection and analysis of parish register returns. Following Abbot's election to the post of Speaker of the House of Commons in February 1802, Rickman took the post of Speaker's Secretary, which he held until July 1814 when he was appointed Second Clerk Assistant at the Table of the House of Commons. In this capacity he drove through a substantial reform to the way in which the House of Commons recorded and published its daily proceedings: the Votes and Proceedings of the House of Commons were first published on 18 April 1817, replacing the Votes of the House of Commons, first publishd in the 1680s. Rickman became Clerk Assistant in 1820, a post which he held to his death. It is often stated that Rickman was Clerk of the House of Commons: this was never the case. Rickman served as Secretary to two Parliamentary Commissions established in 1803. The first for the making of roads and bridges in Scotland; the second for the construction of the Caledonian Canal through Scotland's Great Glen. The civil engineer Thomas Telford was amongst the commissioners on both these Commissions: John Rickman was a close friend of Telford, and was his executor, as well as the editor of Telford's autobiography.Diaries of George Turnbull (Chief Engineer, East Indian Railway Company) held at the Centre of South Asian Studies at Cambridge University, EnglandGeorge Turnbull, C.E. page 18 of the 437-page memoirs published privately 1893, scanned copy held in the British Library, London on compact disk since 2007 Besides Rickman's work on the census, he also collected and mustered other statistics. Between 1816 and 1836 he abstracted the poor rate returns for the Poor Law Committee; later he produced returns on Education for Lord John Russell's Education Committee and in 1839 he compiled a return of Local Taxation. In April 1815 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. The subtitle to Orlo William's biography of Rickman: Lamb's Friend the Census Taker under-emphasises his extensive parliamentary work.

The pictured example was a one-off version manufactured to celebrate the production of a million cars of the type. The term Wirtschaftswunder (, \\"economic miracle\\"), also known as the Miracle on the Rhine, describes the rapid reconstruction and development of the economies of West Germany and Austria after World War II (adopting an ordoliberalism-based social market economy). The expression referring to this phenomenon was first used by The Times in 1950. Beginning with the replacement of the Reichsmark with the Deutsche Mark in 1948 as legal tender (the Schilling was similarly re- established in Austria), a lasting era of low inflation and rapid industrial growth was overseen by the government led by West German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer and his Minister of Economics, Ludwig Erhard, who went down in history as the \\"father of the German economic miracle.\\" In Austria, efficient labor practices led to a similar period of economic growth. The era of economic growth raised West Germany and Austria from total wartime devastation to developed nations in modern Europe. At the founding of the European Common Market in 1957 West Germany's economic growth stood in contrast to the struggling conditions at the time in the United Kingdom. West Germany German refugees from the east in Berlin in 1945 The fundamental reason for the quick economic recovery of West Germany can be found in the ordoliberal growth model. West Germany had a skilled workforce and a high technological level in 1946, but its capital stock had largely been destroyed during and after the war. This small capital stock was compounded by the difficulty in converting the German economy to the production of civilian goods, as well as rampant monetary and regulatory problems, leading to an unusually low economic output during the first post-war years. These initial problems were overcome by the time of the currency reform of 1948, which replaced the Reichsmark with the Deutsche Mark as legal tender, halting rampant inflation. This act to strengthen the West German economy had been explicitly forbidden during the two years that JCS 1067 was in effect. JCS 1067 had directed the U.S. forces of occupation in West Germany to \\"take no steps looking toward the economic rehabilitation of Germany\\". At the same time, the government, following Erhard's advice, cut taxes sharply on moderate incomes. Walter Heller, a young economist with the U.S. occupation forces who was later to become chairman of President Kennedy's Council of Economic Advisers, wrote in 1949 that to \\"remove the repressive effect of extremely high rates, Military Government Law No. 64 cut a wide swath across the German tax system at the time of the currency reform.\\" Individual income tax rates, in particular, fell dramatically. Previously the tax rate on any income over 6,000 Deutschmark had been 95 percent. After tax reform, this 95 percent rate applied only to annual incomes above 250,000 Deutschmark. For the West German with an annual income of about 2,400 Deutschmark in 1950, the marginal tax rate fell from 85 percent to 18 percent. War damage in a German city in Saxony in 1945 The Allied dismantling of the West German coal and steel industries decided at the Potsdam Conference was virtually completed by 1950; equipment had then been removed from 706 manufacturing plants in the west and steel production capacity had been reduced by 6,700,000 tons. Although the industrially important Saarland with its rich coal fields was returned to West Germany in 1957, it remained economically integrated in a customs union with France until 1959 and France extracted coal from the area until 1981. West Germany proceeded quickly after 1948 to rebuild its capital stock and thus to increase its economic output at stunning rates. The very high capital investment rate thanks to low consumption and a very small need for replacement capital investments (due to the still small capital stock) drove this recovery during the 1950s. Living standards also rose steadily, with the purchasing power of wages increasing by 73% from 1950 to 1960. As noted by the British journalist Terence Prittie in the early Sixties: Productivity growth in West Germany enabled most workers to obtain significant improvements in their living standards and 'security of life.' In addition, as noted by David Eversley, =Reparations= In addition to the physical barriers that had to be overcome for the West German economic recovery, there were also intellectual challenges. The Allies confiscated intellectual property of great value, all German patents, both in Germany and abroad, and used them to strengthen their own industrial competitiveness by licensing them to Allied companies.C. Lester Walker \\"Secrets By The Thousands\\", Harper's Magazine. October 1946. Immediately after the German surrender and for the next two years, the U.S. pursued a vigorous program to harvest all technological and scientific know- how as well as all patents in Germany. John Gimbel's book \\"Science Technology and Reparations: Exploitation and Plunder in Postwar Germany\\" concludes the \\"intellectual reparations\\" taken by the U.S. and the UK amounted to close to $10 billion.Norman M. Naimark, The Russians in Germany, p. 206. (Naimark refers to Gimbel's book.)The $10 billion compares to the U.S. annual GDP of $258 billion in 1948.The $10 billion compares to the total Marshall plan expenditure (1948‚Äì1952) of $13 billion, of which West Germany received $1.4 billion (partly as loans). During the more than two years this policy was in place, new industrial research in Germany was hampered because it was unprotected and freely available to overseas competitors, encouraged by occupation authorities to access all records and facilities. =Marshall Plan= Builders in West Berlin working on a project funded with Marshall Aid, 1952 Meanwhile, thousands of the best German researchers and engineers were working in the Soviet Union and in the United States. The Marshall Plan was only extended to Western Germany after it was realized the suppression of its economy was holding back the recovery of other European countries and was not the main force behind the Wirtschaftswunder. Although, it likely greatly contributed to Germany's overall economic recovery. Furthermore, often overlooked is the effect of the \\"unofficial contributions\\" of 150,000 U.S. occupation troops, earning as much as 4 Deutschmark to the dollar. These marks were spent within West Germany to buy food, luxury items, beer and cars, as well as entertaining the locals and for prostitutes.\\"Deployment of Military Personnel by Country,\\" U.S. Department of Defense, Washington Headquarters Services. During exercises such numbers of soldiers would swell to over 250,000. Nonetheless, the amount of monetary aid, which was mainly in the form of loans, about $1.4 billion, was greatly overshadowed by the amount the Germans had to pay back as war reparations and by the charges the Allies made on the Germans for the ongoing cost of the occupation, about $2.4 billion per year. In 1953 it was decided that Germany would repay $1.1 billion of the aid it had received. The last repayment was made in June 1971. The demands of the Korean War in 1950‚Äì53 led to a global shortage of goods that helped overcome lingering resistance to the purchase of West German products. At the time West Germany had a large pool of skilled labour, partly as a result of the deportations and migrations which affected up to 16.5 million Germans. This helped West Germany to more than double the value of its exports during and shortly after the war. Apart from these factors, hard work and long hours at full capacity among the population in the 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s and extra labour supplied by thousands of Gastarbeiter (\\"guest workers\\", since the late 1950s) provided a vital base for the sustainment of the economic upturn with additional workforce. From the late 1950s onwards, West Germany had one of the world's strongest economies. The East German economy also showed strong growth, but not as much as in West Germany, due to the bureaucratic system, emigration of working-age East Germans to West Germany and continued reparations to the USSR in terms of resources. Unemployment hit a record low of 0.7‚Äì0.8% in 1961‚Äì1966 and 1970‚Äì1971. Ludwig Erhard, who served as Minister of the Economy in Chancellor Adenauer's cabinet from 1949 until 1963 and would later rise to Chancellor himself, is often associated with the West German Wirtschaftswunder. Austria Mooserboden reservoir, Kaprun, 1968 Austria was also included in the Marshall Plan and can thus be included in any consideration of the Wirtschaftswunder. Through the nationalisation of key industries (VOEST, AMAG, Steyr-Puch) and yet more long working hours, full economic capacity was reached. Using West Germany as a guide, the currency was stabilised when the Schilling was reintroduced in place of the Reichsmark. This economic policy was known in journalistic circles as the Raab-Kamitz- Kurs, named after Julius Raab, Austrian chancellor from 1953, and his Finance Minister Reinhard Kamitz similar to the West German Adenauer-Erhard-Kurs. By state major projects such as the Kaprun hydroelectric plant or the West Autobahn, unemployment fell and social peace was ensured. In the 1950s the first Gastarbeiter from Southern Italy and Greece arrived in the country, as more manual labour was required to maintain the economic upswing.

Attorney John Wells founded the practice in 1792. Cadwalader's Lower Manhattan headquarters is one of five offices in three countries. At the end of 2014 the firm had approximately 400 attorneys. Overview New York City's oldest law firm, Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft is headquartered at 200 Liberty Street in Lower Manhattan. The firm's managing partner, Patrick Quinn, oversees approximately 400 attorneys as of year-end 2014. It operates out of five offices across the United States and Europe. In addition to its Wall Street location, Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft has offices in Washington, D.C., Charlotte, London and Brussels. In 2014, Cadwalader generated $481.5 million, with a profit per partner of $2.21 million. History In 1792, attorney John Wells, a Princeton graduate who was one of approximately 80 lawyers in New York City at the time, founded the law firm that ultimately became known as Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft. The firm became a partnership called Wells & Strong in 1818 when George Washington Strong joined Wells' practice. Wells' death in 1823 prompted Strong to bring in George Griffin as partner. Griffin then left in 1838 and George Washington Strong partnered with Marshall Bidwell. George Washington Strong's son, George Templeton Strong, a lawyer and noted diarist, joined the firm in 1844. The firm became known as Strong, Bidwell & Strong. The firm became Bidwell & Strong in 1855 after George Washington Strong's death. Charles E. Strong, George Templeton Strong's cousin, became the firm's chief in the 1870s. During his tenure, he considered shuttering the firm and moving from law to banking. In 1878, Strong partnered with John Lambert Cadwalader, who was assistant secretary of state during President Ulysses S. Grant's administration. =Corporate law and civic responsibility= George Washington Strong established the first Bank for Savings for the City of New York in 1816. Shipping, transportation and real estate matters handled on behalf of John Jacob Astor involved Strong in the legal work necessary to establish New York City‚Äôs first public library in 1849. If you follow Cadwalader's historical thread, you will find your way to John Cadwalader, who orchestrated the legal work necessary to establish The New York Public Library. As an attorney for Philip Schuyler, George Templeton Strong provided legal assistance to Eliza Schuyler Hamilton in establishing the Orphan Asylum Society. In 1848, the firm established the New York Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor and advised The Association for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. In 1861, George T. Strong established the United States Sanitary Committee, a forerunner to the American Red Cross, which raised more than $5 million for Union soldiers in need of medical care. Strong‚Äôs cousin and law partner Charles went on to oversee the establishment of the New York Medical College & Hospital for Women and Children. George T. Strong assisted with the development of Columbia Law in 1858, and, in 1870, George T. Strong and John Cadwalader were Charter Members of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York ‚Äì which grew into the ABA in 1878. Joined by George Wickersham, who would become U.S. Attorney General in 1909, and Henry Taft, the law firm that would become Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft always believed that it would be dedicated to corporate law and civic duty. Cadwalader also named the first female partner to what is considered to be a ‚ÄúWall Street Law Firm.‚Äù In 1921, George Wickersham became a founder and Chairman of the Board of the Council on Foreign Relations. It was 1921 that also saw the establishment of the relationship between Cadwalader and The Salvation Army, a business and service relationship that continues to this day. In the 1960s, the firm represented Margaret Sanger, the founder of the birth control movement, and her Margaret Sanger Research Bureau, which merged with Planned Parenthood in 1973. George W. Wickersham, an antitrust lawyer, joined the firm in 1883 and made partner in 1887. Wickersham was named U.S. Attorney General under President William Howard Taft. Henry W. Taft, President Taft's brother, began working at Cadwalader in 1889. He became partner in 1899 and served as special assistant to the U.S. Attorney General from 1905 to 1907. The firm became known as Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft in 1914. In the 1930s, Cadwalader was involved with the custody trial determining the guardianship of Gloria Vanderbilt. Catherine Noyes Lee became Cadwalader's first female partner in 1942. Cadwalader expanded its footprint as the firm opened an office in Charlotte, North Carolina, in 1996, established a London presence in 1997 and opened its first office in China‚Äîin Beijing‚Äîin 2005. Cadwalader‚Äôs global headquarters in the One World Financial Center, New York City In the mid-1990s, a group of young partners formed what some at Cadwalader referred to as Project Rightsize, an effort from 1994 to 1995 to remove less productive partners. The group shuttered Cadwalader's office in Palm Beach, Florida, and reduced a branch in Los Angeles, California. In all, 17 partners, nearly 20 percent, left the firm. Critics said the move was driven by individuals' financial interests and two former partners successfully sued Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft for violating its partnership agreement. Following the September 11, 2001, terror attacks, Cadwalader assisted families of those killed, including immigrant families. A portion of the firm's post-9/11 work occurred when attorneys learned there was no central resource for families seeking benefits; as a result, Cadwalader lawyers put together the \\"Handbook of Public and Private Assistance Resources for the Victims and Families of the World Trade Center Attacks\\", which was released in November 2001. The firm released an expanded version the following year. Cadwalader also represented Nobel Prize laureate Malala Yousafzai, helping her negotiate and establish The Malala Fund after the assassination attempt by the Taliban. During the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008, Cadwalader reduced its number of lawyers by about 20 percent in 2008. A reporter for The Wall Street Journal suggested the move was meant to lower operating costs as demand for its services decreased. Then-Chairman W. Christopher White stated, \\"There was a bubble, we rode that bubble, it contracted, and we adjusted\\". Also during the fiscal crisis, Cadwalader attorneys served as advisers for the U.S. Treasury as Chrysler and General Motors restructured. Cadwalader expanded in China with a Hong Kong office in 2010. In 2011, it opened offices in Houston and Brussels. In 2013, James C. Woolery left JP Morgan Chase for Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft. The next year, Woolery was selected to take over as the firm's new chairman starting in 2015. In January 2015, when the chairman-elect was slated to take the chairman's post, the firm announced Woolery had left Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft to launch a hedge fund. The firm eliminated the chairman position and Managing Partner Patrick Quinn began overseeing the firm. Areas of practice Cadwalader's practices cover varying areas of law, including: antitrust, capital markets, corporate, energy and commodities, finance, financial restructuring, financial services, health care/not-for-profit, intellectual property, litigation, tax and private wealth, and white collar defense and investigations. The firm has long-standing client relationships with premier financial institutions, Fortune 500 companies, government entities, charitable and health care organizations, and private clients. The firm also takes on pro bono assignments, providing attorneys for non-profit organizations, including those assisting women, children and immigrants. One of the firm's highest- profile pro bono clients was Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai. Cadwalader began representing the female education activist in 2012, while she was seventeen years old and still hospitalized by a Taliban shooting. The firm continued to represent her for two years, ultimately establishing the Malala Fund, a nonprofit organization advocating for women's access to education. Rankings and recognition Law associates surveyed for the Vault 100 law firm rankings placed Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft at No. 31 on its 2016 list of most prestigious firms to work for. Also in 2015, U.S. News & World Report named Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft \\"Law Firm of the Year\\" for derivatives and futures law. Cadwalader was ranked No. 1 on the Commercial Mortgage Alert's top issuer counsel and top underwriter counsel tables for commercial mortgage- backed securities in 2015. Additionally, the firm has received recognition for its business culture and diversity. In 2015, The American Lawyer ranked Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft No. 65 on the Am Law 100, an annual ranking of U.S. firms by gross revenue. The publication also classified Cadwalader as one of only twenty-four \\"Superrich Firms\\" in the United States, categorized as those generating both $1 million in revenue per lawyer and $2 million in profits per partner.

A Forward Operating Base (FOB) is any secured forward operational level military position, commonly a military base, that is used to support strategic goals and tactical objectives. A FOB may or may not contain an airfield, hospital, machine shop, or other logistical facilities. The base may be used for an extended period of time. FOBs are traditionally supported by main operating bases that are required to provide backup support to them. https://fas.org/irp/doddir/dod/jp3_09_3.pdfA FOB also improves reaction time to local areas as opposed to having all troops on the main operating base. Description In its most basic form, a FOB consists of a ring of barbed wire around a position with a fortified entry control point, or ECP. More advanced FOBs include an assembly of berms, concrete barriers, gates, watchtowers, bunkers and other force protection infrastructure. They are often built from Hesco bastions.

He was the Minister of State for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing from 2009 to 2010. Hanson served as Shadow Treasury Minister from 2010 to 2011 and Shadow Minister of State for Immigration from 2011 to 2015.  Early life and family  Hanson was born in Liverpool, Lancashire, and is the son of Brian Hanson (deceased), a forklift truck driver, and Glenda Hanson, a personnel records clerk, and has a younger sister, Helen. He was educated at Roscoe Primary School in Liverpool, Grange Primary School and Verdin County Comprehensive School in Winsford, Cheshire, and the University of Hull, where he received a BA in 1978 and a CertEd in 1980, whilst in Hull he was the vice president of the university students' union and a member of Hull University Labour Club. He began his career with the Cooperative Society in 1980 as a trainee manager, becoming a manager in Plymouth in 1981. He joined the Spastics Society, now Scope, in 1982. He left the Society in 1989, when he was appointed as a director at the Society for the Prevention of Solvent Abuse. He married Margaret Rose Mitchell, who has also been a politician in Vale Royal. She was narrowly defeated at the 1999 Eddisbury by- election, the same constituency he himself had fought in 1987. They have a son and three daughters. Political career He was elected as a councillor to the Vale Royal Borough Council in 1983 becoming the Labour group and council leader in 1989 until 1991 when he stood down to fight Delyn at the 1992 election. He was also elected as a councillor to the Northwich Town Council in 1987 and also led the Labour group there in 1989 for a year, he left the Town Council in 1991. He unsuccessfully contested Eddisbury at the 1983 general election where he was defeated by the sitting Conservative MP Alastair Goodlad by some 14,846 votes. In 1984 he contested the West Cheshire seat for the European Parliament but was again unsuccessful. He contested Delyn in Wales at the 1987 general election but was defeated by the Tory Keith Raffan by 1,224 votes. It proved third time lucky for Hanson when he was elected to the House of Commons at the 1992 general election when, following Raffan's retirement, he won the Clwyd seat at Delyn by 2,039. He made his maiden speech on 6 May 1992. Hanson (left) speaking to Policy Exchange in 2013 In parliament he was a member of the Welsh affairs select committee from 1992 until he joined the public accounts committee in 1996. He became the Parliamentary Private Secretary PPS to the Chief Secretary to the Treasury Alistair Darling in 1997 and became a member of the Tony Blair government in his first reshuffle in 1998 when he was appointed as an Assistant Government Whip. He was promoted in 1999 on his appointment as the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Wales Office. Following the 2001 general election he became the PPS to Prime Minister Tony Blair. He served as the Minister of State at the Northern Ireland Office from the 2005 general election until 8 May 2007, when the Northern Ireland Assembly was restored after its period of suspension. He was the Minister of State at the new Ministry of Justice from 9 May 2007 until 8 June 2009. On 21 February 2007, his approval to the Privy Council was announced. He was Minister of State for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing at the Home Office from 8 June 2009 until the 2010 general election. He then shadowed that role, and after the Labour leadership election was appointed Shadow Treasury Minister. In September 2011 he contributed to the book What Next for Labour? Ideas for a new Generation, his piece was entitled \\"What Awaits Labour in 2015?\\" Hanson lost his seat in the 2019 general election to Rob Roberts, the Conservative Party candidate.

The designer and researcher creates human-looking robots who have realistic facial expressions. He is mainly known for Hanson Robotics, the company that created Sophia and other robots designed to mimic human behavior. Sophia has received widespread media attention, and was the first robot to be granted citizenship.  Early life and education  Hanson was born on December 20, 1969 in Dallas, Texas, United States. He studied at Highland Park High School for his senior year to focus on math and science. As a teenager, Hanson‚Äôs hobbies included drawing and reading science fiction works by writers like Isaac Asimov and Philip K. Dick‚Äîthe latter of whom he would later replicate in android form. Hanson has a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the Rhode Island School of Design in film/animation/video, and a Ph.D. from the University of Texas at Dallas in interactive arts and engineering. In 1995 as part of an independent-study project on out-of-body experiences, he built a humanoid head in his own likeness, operated by a remote operator. Hanson‚Äôs dissertation was entitled Development of an Advanced Respirator Fit-Test Headform.  Career  \\"Albert Hubo\\" a robot created by Hanson and the KAIST Hubo groupHanson‚Äôs career has focused on creating humanlike robots. Hanson's most well-known creation is Sophia, the world's first ever robot citizen. In 2004 at a Denver American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) conference, Hanson presented K-Bot, a robotic head created with polymer skin, finely sculpted features, and big blue eyes. Named after his lab assistant Kristen Nelson, the robot head had 24 servomotors for realistic movement and cameras in its eyes. At the time he was 33 years old and a graduate student at the University of Texas Dallas. After he graduated from university, Hanson worked as an artist, and went on to work for Disney where he was a sculptor and material researcher in the Disney Imagineering Lab. He has worked as a designer, sculptor, and robotics developer for Universal Studios and MTV. In 2004, Hanson built the humanoid robot Hertz, a female presenting animated robot head that took about nine months to build. Hanson is the founder and CEO of Hong Kong-based Hanson Robotics, which was founded in 2013. Hanson has been published in materials science, artificial intelligence, cognitive science, and robotics journals. Hanson argues precise human looks are a must if people are going to effectively communicate with robots. Hanson believes social humanoid robots have the potential to serve humanity in a variety of functions and helping roles, like tutor, companion, or security guard. He argues the realism of his work has the potential to pose \\"an identity challenge to the human being,\\" and that realistic robots may polarize the market between those who love realistic robots and those who find them disturbing. Many of Hanson's creations currently serve at research or non-profit institutions around the world, including at the University of Cambridge, University of Geneva, University of Pisa and in laboratories for cognitive science and AI research. Hanson's creation Zeno, a two-foot tall robot designed in the style of a cartoon boy, provides treatment sessions to children with autism in Texas as a result of a collaboration between the University of Texas at Arlington, Dallas Autism Treatment Center, Texas Instruments and National Instruments, and Hanson. Other robots include Albert Einstein HUBO, a robotic head designed to look like Albert Einstein's and put it on top of the \\"HUBO\\" bipedal robotic frame, and Professor Einstein, a 14.5 inch personal robot that engages in conversation and acts as a companion/tutor. Hanson collaborated with musician David Byrne on Song for Julio, which appeared at the Reina Sofia Museum in Madrid in 2008 as part of the M√°quinas&Almas; (Souls&Machines;) exhibit, and his creations have appeared in other museums around the world.  Educational institutions  From 2011 to 2013 Hanson was an Adjunct Professor of Computer Science and Engineering Teaching at the University of Texas at Arlington. He also taught in 2010 at the University of North Texas as an adjunct professor in fine arts, kinetic/interactive sculpture, and at the University of Texas at Dallas as an instructor of independent study in interactive sculpture.

The bacterial capsule is a large structure of many bacteria. It is a polysaccharide layer that lies outside the cell envelope, and is thus deemed part of the outer envelope of a bacterial cell. It is a well-organized layer, not easily washed off, and it can be the cause of various diseases. The capsule‚Äîwhich can be found in both gram negative and gram-positive bacteria‚Äîis different from the second lipid membrane ‚Äì bacterial outer membrane, which contains lipopolysaccharides and lipoproteins and is found only in gram-negative bacteria. When the amorphous viscid secretion (that makes up the capsule) diffuses into the surrounding medium and remains as a loose undemarcated secretion, it is known as a slime layer. Capsule and slime layer are sometimes summarized under the term glycocalyx. A bacterial capsule has a semi-ridged border that follows the contour of the cell. The capsule excludes India Ink when dyed. A slime layer is a non-ridged matrix that is easily deformed and is not able to exclude India Ink. Biofilms are composed of many cells and their outer barriers. The primary functions of both capsules and slime layers are for protection and adhesion.  Composition  Most bacterial capsules are composed of polysaccharide, but some species use other materials, such as poly-D-glutamic acid in Bacillus anthracis. Because most capsules are so tightly packed, they are difficult to stain because most standard stains cannot penetrate the capsule. To visualize encapsulated bacteria using a microscope, a sample is treated with a dark stain, such as India ink. The structure of the capsule prevents the stain from penetrating the cell. When viewed, bacterial capsules appear as a bright halo around the cell on a dark background.  Function  The capsule is considered a virulence factor because it enhances the ability of bacteria to cause disease (e.g. prevents phagocytosis). The capsule can protect cells from engulfment by eukaryotic cells, such as macrophages. A capsule-specific antibody may be required for phagocytosis to occur. Capsules also contain water which protects the bacteria against desiccation. They also exclude bacterial viruses and most hydrophobic toxic materials such as detergents. Immunity to one capsule type does not result in immunity to the other types. Capsules also help cells adhere to surfaces. As a group where the capsule is present they are known as polysaccharide encapsulated bacteria or encapsulated bacteria.  Diversity  The capsule is found most commonly among gram-negative bacteria: * Escherichia coli (in some strains) * Neisseria meningitidis * Klebsiella pneumoniae * Haemophilus influenzae * Pseudomonas aeruginosa * Salmonella However, some gram-positive bacteria may also have a capsule: * Bacillus megaterium for example, synthesizes a capsule composed of polypeptide and polysaccharides. * Bacillus anthracis * Streptococcus pyogenes synthesizes a hyaluronic acid capsule. * Streptococcus pneumoniae has at least 91 different capsular serotypes. These serotypes are the basis for the pneumococcal vaccines. * Streptococcus agalactiae produces a polysaccharide capsule of nine antigenic types that all contain sialic acid (Ia, Ib, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII). * Staphylococcus epidermidis * Staphylococcus aureus The yeast Cryptococcus neoformans, though not a bacterium, has a similar capsule. Capsules too small to be seen with an ordinary microscope, such as the M protein of Streptococcus pyogenes, are called microcapsules.  Demonstration of capsule  # India ink staining: the capsule appears as a clear halo around the bacterium as the ink can't penetrate the capsule. # Maneval's capsule stain: the capsule appears as a clear halo between the pink-stained bacterium and the bluish-grey stained background. The background stain is the acidic stain Congo red (which changes color to bluish-grey due to the pH), and the pink stain is acid fuschin. # Serological methods: Capsular material is antigenic and can be demonstrated by mixing it with a specific anticapsular serum. When examined under the microscope, the capsule appears 'swollen' due to an increase in its refractivity. This phenomenon is the basis of quellung reaction.  Use in vaccination  Vaccination using capsular material is effective against some organisms (e.g., H. influenzae type b, S. pneumoniae, and N. meningitidis). However, polysaccharides are not highly antigenic, especially in children, so many capsular vaccines contain polysaccharides conjugated with protein carriers, such as the tetanus toxoid or diphtheria toxoid. This stimulates a much more robust immune response.

Life and career Born in Fort William, Ontario, he worked as a news editor for Canadian Press and a reporter for the Winnipeg Free Press and he attended the University of Manitoba. Chadderton played for the Winnipeg Rangers hockey team, the farm team for the New York Rangers. He enlisted on 15 October 1939, serving with The Royal Winnipeg Rifles of the Non-Permanent Active Militia. Chadderton rose from non-commissioned rank to officer commanding an infantry company with the acting rank of Major. He was stationed in Britain, France, Belgium and the Netherlands. He was wounded twice, once by a bullet at the Abbaye d'Ardenne in Normandy and once by a grenade near the Leopold Canal, losing his right leg below the knee. In 1965, Chadderton became the Chief Executive Officer of The War Amps. In 1967, the Government of Canada named Chadderton to the position of Executive Secretary to the Canadian Pension Survey Committee along with Hon. Judge Randall and Colonel Roger Nantel under the Department of Veterans Affairs in Ottawa, Ontario. He was Chairman of the National Council of Veteran Associations in Canada, an umbrella organization for a variety of veterans' groups. Chadderton played a leading role in the campaign against the controversial NFB documentary, The Kid Who Couldn't Miss and in pressuring the Canadian War Museum to rewrite its Bomber Command exhibit. In 1992, he led the fight to put pressure on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) from re-broadcasting a controversial documentary series it commissioned called The Valour and the Horror. The CBC's Ombudsman, Bill Morgan, decided with Chadderton, and stated that \\"the series was 'flawed' and 'fails to measure up' to CBC's standards.\\" Chadderton married Dorothy Barnfather, with whom he had two children, four grandchildren, and five great grandchildren.

He claimed to be inspired by God to spread the gospel through the design of his swampy land into Paradise Garden, a folk art sculpture garden with over 46,000 pieces of art. His creations include outsider art, na√Øve art, and visionary art. Finster came to widespread notice in the 1980s with his album cover designs for R.E.M. and Talking Heads. Early life Finster was born at Valley Head, Alabama, to Samuel and Lula Finster, and lived on the family farm as one of 13 children. He attended school from age six into the sixth grade. He said he had his first vision at the age of three years, when he saw his recently deceased sister Abbie Rose walking down out of the sky wearing a white gown. She told him, \\"Howard, you're gonna be a man of visions.\\" He became \\"born again\\" at a Baptist revival at the age of 13 and began to preach at 16. He gave the occasional sermon at local churches and wrote articles for the town newspaper, and became a full- time pastor at Rock Bridge Baptist Church in 1940. He later served at the Mount Carmel Baptist Church in Fort Payne, Alabama, shortly before venturing into full-time art. Artistic works Finster began building his first garden park museum in Trion, Georgia, in the late 1940s. It featured an exhibit on the inventions of mankind in which Finster planned to display one of everything that had ever been invented, models of houses and churches, a pigeon flock and a duck pond. Paradise Gardens in Summerville, GA, built by Finster. When he ran out of land in Trion in 1961, he moved to Pennville, Georgia, near Summerville, and bought four acres (16,000 m¬≤) of land upon which to build the Plant Farm Museum \\"to show all the wonderful things o' God's Creation, kinda like the Garden of Eden.\\"Finster 1989, p. 108 It features such attractions as the \\"Bible House,\\" \\"the Mirror House,\\" \\"the Hubcap Tower,\\" \\"the Bicycle Tower,\\" \\"the Machine Gun Nest,\\" and the largest structure in the garden, the five-story \\"Folk Art Chapel.\\" He also started putting up signs with Bible verses on them because \\"he felt that they stuck in people's heads better that way.\\" He retired from preaching in 1965 and focused all of his time on improving the Plant Farm Museum. In 1976, he had another vision to paint sacred art. According to Finster, \\"...one day I was workin' on a patch job on a bicycle, and I was rubbin' some white paint on that patch with this finger here, and I looked at the round tip o' my finger, and there was a human face on it... then a warm feelin' come over my body, and a voice spoke to me and said, 'Paint sacred art.'\\"Finster 1989, p. 123 One of Finster's last portraits; Don Swartzentruber. His diverse range of subjects include pop culture icons like Elvis Presley, historical figures like George Washington, Ronald Reagan, religious images like The Devils Vice and \\"John the Baptist,\\" UFOs and aliens, war and politics.Outsider Art Sourcebook, ed. John Maizels, Raw Vision, Watford, 2009, p.73 His paintings are colorful and detailed; they use flat picture plane without perspective and are often covered with words, especially Bible verses. Every painting also has a number: God had asked him to do 5,000 paintings to spread the gospel and Finster wanted to keep track. He finished the 5,000 a few days before Christmas in 1985, but continued painting and numbering until the day he died. By 1989, he was already numbering in the ten thousands. He first started receiving outside publicity in 1975. That year, Atlanta-based WAGA ran a story; he also appeared in an Esquire magazine article that first dubbed his museum Paradise Garden. He made his first exhibition appearance in 1976 and painted four paintings for the Library of Congress in 1977. He was also selected to be part of the Venice Biennale in 1984. Several of Finster's pieces are on display at the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, D.C.Howard Finster, SAAM Finster gained national fame after his collaborative work with Athens, Georgia-based rock band R.E.M.. The group filmed the video for the group's debut single \\"Radio Free Europe\\" in Finster's Paradise Gardens in 1983. The following year, the band's singer Michael Stipe and Finster collaborated on a painting for the cover of their second album Reckoning. After that the band made the song \\"Maps and Legends\\" (in its third album Fables of the Reconstruction) as an homage to Finster. Along with R.E.M., Finster also appeared in the documentary film Athens, GA: Inside Out, filmed in 1985, in which he tells the story of how he came to be an artist. Finster (and his art) also appears in the band's video for Radio Free Europe. The band Talking Heads commissioned a Finster painting for Little Creatures in 1985 that was subsequently selected as album cover of the year by Rolling Stone magazine. Other artists to use Finster as an album cover designer include Memory Dean, Pierce Pettis, and Adam Again. In 1994, a portion of his Paradise Garden was installed as part of the permanent collection of Atlanta's High Museum. Bill Mallonee of the Vigilantes of Love (also a Christian from Athens, Georgia) wrote a song inspired by Finster's artwork called The Glory and the Dream in 1994. Howard Finster was responsible for introducing millions to outsider art, but even with his fame, he remained focused on religious outreach. He said of the Talking Heads album, \\"I think there's twenty-six religious verses on that first cover I done for them. They sold a million records in the first two and a half months after it come out, so that's twenty-six million verses I got out into the world in two and a half months!\\"Finster 1989, p. 197 The classification of his creations overlap folk art\\"folk artist\\" in this NY Times article. and outsider art\\"outsider artist\\" in this Lehigh University Art Galleries article . for the origin, na√Øve art\\"outsider/primitive/naive artist\\" in this Lehigh University Art Galleries article .\\"naive artist\\" in this NY Times article. and visionary art\\"visionary artist\\" in for the content.

The reaction is shown below: :CsOH + HF ‚Üí CsF + H2O Using the same reaction, another way to create caesium fluoride is to treat caesium carbonate (Cs2CO3) with hydrofluoric acid and again, the resulting salt can then be purified by recrystallization. The reaction is shown below: :Cs2CO3 \\\\+ 2 HF ‚Üí 2 CsF + H2O + CO2 CsF is more soluble than sodium fluoride or potassium fluoride in organic solvents. It is available in its anhydrous form, and if water has been absorbed, it is easy to dry by heating at 100 ¬∞C for two hours in vacuo. CsF reaches a vapor pressure of 1 kilopascal at 825 ¬∞C, 10 kPa at 999 ¬∞C, and 100 kPa at 1249 ¬∞C. CsF chains with a thickness as small as one or two atoms can be grown inside carbon nanotubes. Structure Caesium fluoride has the halite structure, which means that the Cs+ and F‚àí pack in a cubic closest packed array as do Na+ and Cl‚àí in sodium chloride. Applications in organic synthesis Being highly dissociated, CsF is a more reactive source of fluoride than related salts. CsF is an alternative to tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride (TBAF) and TAS-fluoride (TASF). =As a base= As with other soluble fluorides, CsF is moderately basic, because HF is a weak acid. The low nucleophilicity of fluoride means it can be a useful base in organic chemistry. CsF gives higher yields in Knoevenagel condensation reactions than KF or NaF. =Formation of C-F bonds= Caesium fluoride serves as a source of fluoride in organofluorine chemistry. Similarly to potassium fluoride, CsF reacts with hexafluoroacetone to form a stable perfluoroalkoxide salt. It will convert electron-deficient aryl chlorides to aryl fluorides (Halex process), although potassium fluoride is more commonly used. =Deprotection agent= Due to the strength of the Si‚ÄìF bond, fluoride is useful for desilylation reactions, i.e. cleavage of Si-O bonds in organic synthesis. CsF is commonly used for such reactions. Solutions of caesium fluoride in THF or DMF attack a wide variety of organosilicon compounds to produce an organosilicon fluoride and a carbanion, which can then react with electrophiles, for example: :500px Precautions Like other soluble fluorides, CsF is moderately toxic.MSDS Listing for cesium fluoride . www.hazard.com .

After that time it owned electric streetcars, along with gasoline, diesel, and propane ‚Äì fueled transit busses. Purchased by the government agency Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) in 1947, it was liquidated in 1950.  Beginnings (C.C.Ry.) In the 1850s, Chicago was growing and better public transportation was needed. Horse drawn omnibuses were shuttling passengers between several recently built interstate railroad stations for radiating lines like spokes of a wheel by 1853, but city/town streets, roads and turnpikes were often muddy, rutted and potholed with travel very difficult. In 1858, omnibus operator Frank Parmelee and a group of investors were awarded a city franchise for a rail horsecar line, but legal challenges caused them to seek a state charter instead. On February 14, 1859, the Chicago City Railway Company (C.C.Ry.) was incorporated and in two months horsecars were running on State Street between Randolph and 12th Streets.  Horsecars  The horsecars were a success from the start. The smooth rail and reduced rolling resistance allowed larger cars to be used in all weather. A typical car was long, wide, and could carry 20 passengers. Although horsecar lines were inexpensive to build, they were expensive to operate. Horses could be up to of the value of a company. They were expensive to buy, needed people to maintain them, were subject to illness, and made a huge amount of manure/waste. By 1880, the C.C.Ry. was looking for a better, mechanical replacement.  Cable cars  In 1880, superintendent Charles Holmes visited San Francisco to see the new and successful cable car lines there, and could see a use for cable cars in Chicago. As with most cities which would use cable cars, the problem in flat-landed Chicago was not one of grades and steep hills and valleys, but of pure transportation capacity. Construction began in 1881 on a system designed by William Eppelsheimer, with lines going south from the downtown area on main thoroughfare State Street and Wabash-Cottage Grove Avenues. This system was to become the largest and most profitable cable car system in the world. State Street service started on January 28, 1882, Cottage Grove Avenue on February 26. Counter to some people's expectations, the cable cars did not suffer much from the elements, and the harsher Chicago climate with extreme variations in summer heat and winter cold was no problem for them. The number of passengers caused a different approach to the cars than the San Francisco cable car system. Rather than using a grip car and single trailer, or combining the grip and trailer into a single car, like the \\"California Cars\\", CCRy used short bi-directional grip cars to pull trains of up to three trailers. The cable cars did not completely replace the horsecars, but they rather created a transportation backbone. In fact, even as the horse lines were being converted to trolleys, the electrical cars from some feeder lines had to be pulled by grip cars through the downtown area, due to the lack of trolley wires there.  Electric streetcars  Electric streetcar of the Chicago City Railway Company As the cable system was being built electric traction was being developed. Although the individual cars cost more, stringing wire cost far less per mile than digging conduits. In 1892, the Chicago City Council allowed C.C.Ry.'s first electric lines. Since the cable lines were already effective, and there was opposition to wires downtown, electric cars were used to replace horsecars on feeder routes when they became available. It was not until 1906, that all CCRy lines were converted to electricity. From then on, the CCRy primarily operated electric streetcars.  Chicago Surface Lines (C.S.L.)  By 1900, political corruption, unscrupulous actions by other companies, and public opinion made it difficult for the street railways to plan ahead. Length and terms of franchises, fare caps, taxes, and property owner consent were some of the problems. Public ownership was discussed, but instead, city ordinances controlling the private companies were passed and appealed for years. One was the Unification Ordinance of November 13, 1913 by the Chicago City Council, which combined management and operations of all Chicago streetcar companies as the Chicago Surface Lines (C.S.L.), taking effect in 1914. The C.C.Ry. became a \\"paper company\\". It continued to own equipment, but the equipment was operated by the C.S.L. and used systemwide throughout the metropolitan area. The CSL was eventually sold to the publicly owned, government agency, Chicago Transit Authority after 88 years of private operations and 34 years since consolidation, on April 22, 1947, and the CCRy was liquidated on February 15, 1950.  Remnants  In 2015 yard switcher CSL #L202 and flat car CTA #314 are at the Fox River Trolley Museum in South Elgin, Illinois. CCRy #209 cable trailer and CSL #9020 electric trailer are at the Illinois Railway Museum in Union, Illinois. Horsecar #10 and grip car #532 were on exhibit in Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry in 1979.

Introduced in 1950, the engine went on to become one of their most successful post-World War II engine designs. It was used in a wide variety of aircraft, both military and civilian, as well as versions for stationary and maritime power. An English Electric Canberra powered by two Avons made the first un-refuelled non-stop transatlantic flight by a jet, and a BOAC de Havilland Comet 4 powered by four Avons made the first scheduled transatlantic crossing by a jet airliner. Production of the Avon aero engine version ended after 24 years in 1974.Gunston 1989, p. 149. Production of the Avon derived industrial version, currently produced by Siemens, continues to this day. The current version of the Avon, the Avon 200, is an industrial gas generator that is rated at 21‚Äì22,000 shp. As of 2011, 1,200 Industrial Avons have been sold, and the type has established a 60,000,000 hour record for its class. Design and development The engine was initially a private venture put forward for the English Electric Canberra. Originally known as the AJ.65 for Axial Jet, 6,500 lbf the engine was based on an initial project concept by Alan Arnold Griffith.\\"Rolls-Royce Aero Engines\\" Gunston, Bill, Patrick Stephens Limited 1989, , p.131,132,133 which combined an axial compressor with a combustion system and single-stage turbine using principles proven in the Rolls-Royce Nene engine. Design work began in 1945. The Avon design team was initially headed by Stanley Hooker assisted by Geoff Wilde. Development of the engine was moved from Barnoldswick to Derby in 1948 and Hooker subsequently left the company, moving to Bristol Engines. The first engine ran on 25 March 1947, with a 12-stage compressor. The engine was difficult to start, would not accelerate and broke first-stage blades. Two-position inlet guide vanes and compressor bleed were among the design changes which allowed the engine, as the RA.2, to run a 25-hour test and fly in the two outboard positions on the converted Avro Lancastrian military serial VM732, from Hucknall on 15 August 1948. The first production engine, which needed a two-stage turbine, was the RA.3, or Avon Mk 101. Several modified versions of this design were produced in the Mk. 100 series. The Avon 200 series was a complete redesign having very little in common with earlier Marks. Differences included a completely new combustion section and a 15-stage compressor based on that of the Armstrong- Siddeley Sapphire. The first application was the Vickers Valiant. Operational history A Mark 122 ‚Äì The rear fuselage of the Hawker Hunter can be removed for engine maintenance The engine entered production in 1950 as the RA.3/Mk.101 with 6,500 lbf (29 kN) thrust in the English Electric Canberra B.2. Similar versions were used in the Canberra B.6, Hawker Hunter and Supermarine Swift. Uprated versions followed, the RA.7/Mk.114 with thrust in the de Havilland Comet C.2, the RA.14/Mk.201, 9,500 lbf (42 kN) in the Vickers Valiant and the RA.26, 10,000 lbf (44 kN) used in the Comet C.3 and Hawker Hunter F.6. An Avon-powered de Havilland Comet 4 flew the first scheduled transatlantic jet service in 1958. The highest thrust version was the RA.29 Mk.301/2 (RB.146) used in later versions of the English Electric Lightning. It produced 12,690 lbf (56,450 N) and 17,110 lbf (72,770 N)\\"World Encyclopedia of Aero Engines ‚Äì 5th edition\\" by Bill Gunston, Sutton Publishing, 2006, p.195 with afterburning. Other aircraft to use the Avon included the de Havilland Sea Vixen, Supermarine Scimitar and Fairey Delta2. The RA.3/Mk.109 was produced under licence by Svenska Flygmotor as the RM5, and an uprated RA.29 as the RM6 with 17,110 lbf (76,110 N) thrust. The RM5 powered the Saab 32 Lansen and the RM6 powered the Saab 35 Draken and all-weather fighter version of the Lansen (J 32B). 300 Avon 113s, and a larger number of Avon 203s were produced under licence in Belgium by Fabrique Nationale. In the US the RA.28-49 was used in the VTOL Ryan X-13 Vertijet aircraft. In Australia, the Avon was used by Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation in the CA-27 Avon-Sabre. The Avon continued in production for the Sud Aviation Caravelle and English Electric (BAC) Lightning until 1974, by which time over 11,000 had been built. It remained in operational service with the RAF until 23 June 2006 in the English Electric Canberra PR.9. Initial design work was done on the 2-spool RB.106/RB.128 as an Avon successor for large supersonic fighters.

For some, it focuses on vocabulary and topics used in the worlds of business, trade, finance, and international relations.

History In 1984, the Kronos Research Group (KRG) was founded by four students of the Novosibirsk State University, two from the Mathematical Department (Dmitry \\"Leo\\" Kuznetsov, Alex Nedoria) and two from the Physics Department (Eugene Tarasov, Vladimir Vasekin). At that time the main objective was to build home computers for the KRG members. In 1985, the group joined the Russian fifth generation computer project START, in which Kronos became a platform for developing modular multiprocessor reconfigurable systems MARSKotov, V.E. Concurrency + modularity + programmability = MARS. Communications of the ACM. Vol. 34 No. 5, 1991, pp. 32-45. and played a leading role in the development of the first Russian full 32-bit workstation and its software. During 7 years (1984-1991) the group designed and implemented: * Kronos 2.1 and Kronos 2.2 - 32-bit processor boards for DEC LSI-11 * Kronos 2.5 - 32-bit processor board for Labtam computers * Kronos 2.6 - 32-bit workstation The project START was finished in 1988. During the post-START years (1988-91), a number of Russian industrial organizations had expressed interest in continuing the Kronos development and some had been involved into facilitating the construction of Kronos and MARS prototypes, including the design of a Kronos-on-chip. Nevertheless, changing in funding levels and the overall economic situation during perestroika did not allow those plans to be realized. Architecture Instruction set design was based on Niklaus Wirth's Modula-2 workstation Lilith, developed at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology of Zurich, which in turn was inspired by the legendary Alto developed at Xerox PARC. The Modula-2-based Kronos was quite amenable to the basic principles of MARS, as Modula-2 is fundamentally modular, allowing programs to be partitioned into units with relatively well defined interfaces. These interfaces supported separate compilation of modules and separation of the module specifications from their implementation. The primary difference between Lilith and Kronos was that the latter was a 32-bit processor, compared with 16-bit Lilith, and Kronos incorporated a number of extensions to the instruction set to accommodate the inter-processor communication necessary in MARS. Kronos satisfied many aspects of the RISC design, although it was not pure RISC: the evaluation stack was used to evaluate expressions and to hold parameters for procedure calls. Since most of executed instructions were encoded in a single byte, the object code for Kronos was very compact. Although Kronos was a proprietary processor, it was nicely suited to the applications which were sensitive to high programmability rather than to software compatibility. For example, embedded control systems require fast and reliable design of new original applications for controlling unique objects and processes. Modula-2 was a perfect language at that time for this purpose, and Kronos was a perfect processor to effectively run the Modula-2 software. The Kronos software included: *several versions of the proprietary operating system Excelsior *the Modula-2, C, and FORTRAN compilers *several CAD systems *several other applications  References   External links  * The Kronos Research Group recovered from Internet Archive * A Brief History of Modula and Lilith * Acquisition of a Kronos workstation and more by the National Museum of Science and Industry in London * Historical source code from Kronos 198x USSR 32-bit workstation * History of the Kronos project (in Russian) * High-Speed Computers of the Soviet Union *Emulator for the Kronos workstation (via Internet Archive) running under Windows-NT.

His most famous result may be his theorem on the existence of a prime decomposition for 3-manifolds. His proof originated the concept of normal surface, a fundamental cornerstone of the theory of 3-manifolds. He was born in Dorpat, Russian Empire (now Tartu, Estonia) and died in T√ºbingen, Germany. He was the son of the mathematician Adolf Kneser and the father of the mathematician Martin Kneser.

He was an editor of Mathematische Zeitschrift, Archiv der Mathematik and Aequationes Mathematicae. Kneser formulated the problem of non-integer iteration of functions and proved the existence of the entire Abel function of the exponential; on the base of this Abel function, he constructed the functional square root of the exponential function as a half-iteration of the exponential, i.e. a function such that .

Opened in 1885, it ran from Second and Spring Streets to First Street and Belmont Avenue. The completed railway was 6,940 feet long, just over a mile and a quarter, with a power house constructed in the middle, at Boylston Street. It was a single track system, with sidings where a down-hill car could coast past an up-hill car. The route included the steepest gradient on any street railway in North America, a 27.7 degree hill along Second Street between Bunker Hill Avenue and Hope Street on Bunker Hill. The line opened to Texas Street on Oct 8, 1885. The railway was created to encourage sales of property west of downtown Los Angeles, property in the area known as Crown Hill. Henry Witmer, E.A. Hall, and Jesse Yarnell, owners of the property, organized the Los Angeles Improvement Company to subdivide the property into 1400 lots and build the cable railway to connect it to downtown. Other backers included downtown businessmen such as Isaac W. Lord and John Hollenbeck, who owned property near the terminus of the line at Second and Spring Streets. A beer garden resort, called City Park, was developed at the northeast corner of First and Lakeshore in order to draw more passengers to the line. In January, 1888, James McLaughlin paid $130,000 for the line and the beer garden, something which turned out to be a most unfortunate decision. By the spring of 1888 demand for lots had fallen off, but by then the Improvement Company had sold all but 52 of its lots. In addition, Hollenbeck had expanded his Hollenbeck Hotel at Second and Spring, Witmer and some associates had built the California Bank at the corner of Second and Fort Street (Broadway), and the city had built a new City Hall on Fort Street just south of Second Street. The system was chronically plagued with damage to its cables and pulleys due to flooding. It had to be closed down for several days in the winter of 1888 because a replacement for a broken cable could not be delivered to the cable house through the muddy streets. In March, 1889, an agreement was made with McLaughlin's Cahuenga Valley Railroad (built in conjunction with Ivar Weid), which served the new Colegrove area, located just south of Hollywood. The cable railway would exchange transfers at First and Belmont so that its patrons could travel from downtown all the way to Colegrove. But in late summer, 1889, the Cahuenga Valley Railroad was prevented from operating within the Los Angeles city limits. On October 13, McLaughlin suspended cable operations ‚Äùindefinitely‚Äù. He applied for a permit to extend the road to Alvarado, but the council denied the permit. On December 24 of that year another flood caused further damage to the line, and it was abandoned in 1890. With its demise, the Second Street Cable Railway had the distinction of being the first cable railway in the United States to go out of business.

The arachnoid can become inflamed because of adverse reactions to chemicals, infection from bacteria or viruses, as the result of direct injury to the spine, chronic compression of spinal nerves, complications from spinal surgery or other invasive spinal procedures, or the accidental intrathecal injection of steroids intended for the epidural space.PDR US-FDA 2010 DataSheet  Depo- Medrol  Pfizer Inflammation can sometimes lead to the formation of scar tissue and adhesion that can make the spinal nerves \\"stick\\" together,NINDS Arachnoiditis Information Page, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health. Accessed 2015-10-23. a condition where such tissue develops in and between the leptomeninges. The condition is extremely painful, especially when progressing to adhesive arachnoiditis. Another form of the condition is arachnoiditis ossificans, in which the arachnoid becomes ossified, or turns to bone, and is thought to be a late- stage complication of the adhesive form of arachnoiditis. Signs and symptoms Illustration of Arachnoiditis Arachnoid inflammation can lead to many painful and debilitating symptoms which can vary greatly in each case, and not all people experience all symptoms. Chronic pain is common, including neuralgia, while numbness and tingling of the extremities can occur with spinal cord involvement, and bowel, bladder, and sexual functioning can be affected if the lower part of the spinal cord is involved. While arachnoiditis has no consistent pattern of symptoms, it frequently affects the nerves that supply the legs and lower back. Many patients experience difficulty sitting for long (or even short) periods of time due to discomfort or pain, or because of efferent neurological or other motor symptoms, such as difficulties controlling limbs. Difficulty sitting can be problematic for patients who have trouble standing or walking for long periods, as wheelchairs are not always helpful in such cases. Causes The root cause of the condition is not entirely clear, and it appears to have multiple causes, including iatrogenic cause from misplaced epidural steroid injection therapy when accidentally administered intrathecally (inside the dura mater, the sac enveloping the arachnoid mater), or from contrast media used in myelography prior to the introduction of metrizamide. Other noninfectious inflammatory processes include surgery, intrathecal hemorrhage, and the administration of anesthetics (e.g. chloroprocaine), and steroids (e.g. prednisolone, triamcinolone acetonide). A variety of other causes exist, including infectious, inflammatory, and neoplastic processes. Infectious causes include bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic agents. Prior spinal surgery has been documented as a cause of arachnoiditis ossificans, as well as for the adhesive form. It can also be caused by long term pressure from either a severe disc herniation or spinal stenosis. Diagnosis For the ossificans form of the condition, unenhanced CT may better show the presence and extent of arachnoid ossifications, and is complementary to MRI, as MRI can be less specific and findings can be confused with regions of calcification or hemosiderin.  Treatment  Arachnoiditis is difficult to treat and treatment is generally limited to alleviation of pain and other symptoms. While arachnoiditis may not yet be curable and can be significantly life-altering, management of the condition, including with medication, physical therapy, and if appropriate, psychotherapy, can help patients cope with the difficulties it presents. Surgical intervention generally has a poor outcome and may only provide temporary relief, but some cases of surgical success have been reported. Epidural steroid injections to treat sciatic pain have been linked as a cause of the disease by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as well as in other research, and are therefore discouraged as a treatment for Arachnoiditis as they will most likely worsen the condition. Some patients benefit from motorized assistance devices such as the Segway or standing wheelchairs, although these types of devices may be beyond the reach of those with limited means. Standing endurance and vibration tolerance are considered before considering such devices in any case. Prognosis Arachnoiditis is a chronic disorder with no known cure, and prognosis may be hard to determine because of an unclear correlation between the beginning of the disease and the appearance of symptoms. For many, arachnoiditis is a disabling disease that causes chronic pain and neurological deficits, and may also lead to other spinal cord conditions, such as syringomyelia.

Vorderasiatisches Museum, Berlin After a brief survey by Hermann Volrath Hilprecht in 1900, it was first excavated in 1902 by Robert Koldewey and Friedrich Delitzsch of the German Oriental Society for eight months. Among other finds, hundreds of Early Dynastic tablets were collected, which ended up in the Berlin Museum and the Istanbul Museum. In March and April 1931, a joint team of the American Schools of Oriental Research and the University of Pennsylvania excavated Shuruppak for a further six week season, with Erich Schmidt as director and with epigraphist Samuel Noah Kramer. The excavation recovered 87 tablets and fragments‚Äîmostly from pre-Sargonic times‚Äîbiconvex, and unbaked. In 1973, a three-day surface survey of the site was conducted by Harriet P. Martin. Consisting mainly of pottery shard collection, the survey confirmed that Shuruppak dates at least as early as the Jemdet Nasr period, expanded greatly in the Early Dynastic period, and was also an element of the Akkadian Empire and the Third Dynasty of Ur.

Shuruppak became a grain storage and distribution city and had more silos than any other Sumerian city. The earliest excavated levels at Shuruppak date to the Jemdet Nasr period about 3000 BC; it was abandoned shortly after 2000 BC. Erich Schmidt found one Isin-Larsa cylinder seal and several pottery plaques which may date to early in the second millennium BC. Surface finds are predominantly Early Dynastic. At the end of the Jemdet Nasr period, there was an archaeologically attested river flood in Shuruppak. Polychrome pottery from a destruction level below the flood deposit has been dated to the Jemdet Nasr period that immediately preceded the Early Dynastic I period.Schmidt (1931).Martin (1988), pp. 20‚Äì23. =Metalwork= Several objects made of arsenical copper were found in Shuruppak/Fara dating from the mid-fourth to early third millennium BC (approximately Jamdat Nasr period), which is quite early for Mesopotamia.

Cornell University Press, 1997 p167 The city expanded to its greatest extent at the end of the Early Dynastic III period (2600 BC to 2350 BC) when it covered about 100 hectares. At this stage it was destroyed by a fire which baked the clay tablets and mudbrick walls, which then survived for millennia. Two possible kings of Shuruppak are mentioned in epigraphic data from later sources found elsewhere. In the Sumerian King List a king Ubara-Tutu is listed as the ruler of Shuruppak and the last king \\"before the flood\\". In the Epic of Gilgamesh, a man named Utanapishtim (also Uta-na'ishtim), son of Ubara-Tutu, is noted to be king of Shuruppak. The names Ziusudra and Atrahasis are also associated with him.

He also developed the Tietze transformations for group presentations, and was the first to pose the group isomorphism problem. Tietze's graph is also named after him; it describes the boundaries of a subdivision of the M√∂bius strip into six mutually-adjacent regions, found by Tietze as part of an extension of the four color theorem to non-orientable surfaces. Education and career Tietze was the son of Emil Tietze and the grandson of Franz Ritter von Hauer, both of whom were Austrian geologists. He was born in Schleinz, Austria-Hungary, and studied mathematics at the Technische Hochschule in Vienna beginning in 1898. After additional studies in Munich, he returned to Vienna, completing his doctorate in 1904 and his habilitation in 1908. From 1910 until 1918 Tietze taught mathematics in Brno, and was promoted to ordinary professor in 1913. He served in the Austrian army during World War I, and then returned to Brno, but in 1919 he took a position at the University of Erlangen, and then in 1925 moved again to the University of Munich, where he remained for the rest of his career. One of his doctoral students was Georg Aumann. Tietze retired in 1950, and died in Munich, West Germany. Awards and honors Tietze was a fellow of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and a fellow of the Austrian Academy of Sciences.

There is an international consensus that some of the actions of the states involved in the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict violate international law, but some of the involved states dispute this. In the Six-Day War in 1967, Israel pre-empted what many Israeli leaders believed to be an imminent Arab attack and invaded and occupied territory that had itself been invaded and occupied by neighboring Egypt, Syria and Jordan in the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War. Following the peace treaties between Israel and Egypt and Israel and Jordan, in which the states relinquished their claims to the Israeli-occupied territory, the conflict today mostly revolves around the Palestinians. The main points of dispute (also known as the \\"core issues\\" or \\"final status issues\\") are the following: * Israel's annexation of East Jerusalem (Israel has also annexed the Golan Heights, but that territory isn't claimed by Palestinians), construction of Israeli settlements in the Palestinian territories and the erection of the Israeli West Bank barrier; * how borders should be decided between Israel and a Palestinian state; * the right of return of the Palestinian refugees from the 1948 and 1967 wars. Customary international law Unlike a treaty agreement, customary international law is usually not written. Customs of a longstanding nature can be codified by formal treaties. The Laws and Customs of War on Land (Hague Convention IV) of 18 October 1907 and the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 are examples of conventional laws that are declarations of customary law.Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, Security Council Resolution 827, 25 May 1993 The drafters of the Statute had explicitly declined to make it a self- contained criminal code. They instead granted the Tribunal jurisdiction over a set of very broadly defined crimes, the specific content of which was to be found in customary international law. Though the Tribunal recognized that binding conventional law could also provide the basis for its jurisdiction, it has in practice always determined that the treaty provisions in question are also declaratory of custom. To prove that a certain rule is customary one has to show that it is reflected in state practice and that there exists a conviction in the international community that such practice is required as a matter of law. In this context, \\"practice\\" relates to official state practice and therefore includes formal statements by states. A contrary practice by some states is possible because if this contrary practice is condemned by the other states, or subsequently denied by the government itself, the original rule is actually confirmed. In accordance with article 13 of the UN Charter, the General Assembly is obligated to initiate studies and to make recommendations that encourage the progressive development of international law and its codification. Acting in that agreed-upon treaty capacity, the General Assembly affirmed the principles of international law that were recognized by the Charter of the Nuremberg Tribunal and directed that they should be codified.See General Assembly Resolution 95 (I), 11 December 1946, and UN General Assembly Resolution 177. Many of those same principles were subsequently adopted for inclusion in draft treaties that were under development by the International Law Commission of the United Nations. They were also incorporated through the agreement of the High Contracting Parties into the Geneva Conventions of 1949.see Nuremberg Principles and Principles of the Nuremberg Tribunal, 1950 In 1993 the UN Security Council \\"acting under Chapter VII of the Charter on the United Nations\\" established an international tribunal and approved a Statute that had been recommended in a report submitted by the UN Secretary-General. It concluded beyond doubt that the law applicable in armed conflict as embodied in the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and the Hague Convention (IV) of 18 October 1907 had become part of international customary law, and should be part of the subject matter jurisdiction of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. In 1998, the United Nations Diplomatic Conference of Plenipotentiaries approved the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. The offenses against unwritten customary international law were amenable to prosecution by international tribunals, like the Nuremberg Tribunal, long before they were codified and incorporated into the subsequent treaties. Conventions, resolutions and declarations Many provisions of international law are based upon principles and norms that were developed in the Americas during the 19th century. They include the principle of uti possidetis of 1810 and the related Monroe Doctrine of 1823, regarding non-colonization and non-intervention. In 1890, the First International Conference of American States adopted a proscription against territorial conquest and agreed upon the non-recognition of all acquisitions made by force. Those principles and regional understandings were recognized in Article 21 of the Covenant of the League of Nations. The system of mandates contained in article 22 of the Covenant was based in part upon those normative declarations and state practices. The Kellogg-Briand Pact of 1928, and the League of Nations approval of the Stimson Doctrine in 1931 were efforts designed to end the practice of coercive territorial revisionism through international law. After World War II, the principles of international law that upheld the territorial integrity of states were incorporated in the Charter of the United Nations, and subsequently reaffirmed in the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, the Organization of African Unity charter respecting the integrity of inherited boundaries, and the 1975 CSCE Helsinki Final Act which contained a proscription that boundaries could only be altered by consent.International Law and International Relations, Beth A. Simmons and Richard H. Steinberg, Cambridge University Press, 2007, , pp. 278‚Äì279 The Chapter on Fundamental Rights and Duties of States in the Charter of the Organization of American States provides that: > The territory of a State is inviolable; it may not be the object, even > temporarily, of military occupation or of other measures of force taken by > another State, directly or indirectly, on any grounds whatever. No > territorial acquisitions or special advantages obtained either by force or > by other means of coercion shall be recognized. Legal issues related to sovereignty In their relations with other peoples and countries during the colonial era the Concert of Europe adopted a fundamental legal principle that the supreme legal authority, or sovereignty, lay outside the indigenous nations. That legal principle resulted in the creation of a large number of dependent states with restricted sovereignty or colonial autonomy. Various terms were used to describe different types of dependent states, such as condominium, mandate, protectorate, colony, and vassal state. After World War II there was strong international pressure to eliminate dependencies associated with colonialism.see American Law Encyclopedia Vol 3, Dependent States, The Declaration Regarding Non-Self- Governing Territories, in Chapter XI of the UN Charter, and The Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, General Assembly Resolution 1514 (XV) The vast majority of the world's sovereign states resulted from the grant of independence to colonial peoples and dependent territories. Prior to World War II many states were formed as a result of wars that were resolved through peace treaties. Some of these peace treaties were imposed on the losing side in a war; others came about as a result of negotiations that followed wars, or were entered into under the threat of war. In these cases, the applicable law was bound in peace treaties among the states. The practice of territorial aggrandizement was prohibited by the UN Charter, a multilateral treaty, and the authoritative explanation of its legal principles contained in UN General Assembly resolution 2625 (XXV) of 24 October 1970, Declaration of Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation Among States in Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations. The purpose of the United Nations is the prevention and removal of threats to peace and the suppression of acts of aggression. The Charter requires that members shall refrain from the threat of, or use of force. According to communis opinio the obligations imposed by those provisions of the Charter have become part of customary international law and are binding on all States, whether they are members of the United Nations or not.The International Law Commission's Draft Articles on State Responsibility: Part 1, Articles 1‚Äì35, By United Nations International Law Commission, Compiled by Shabtai Rosenne, Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1991, , p. 189 =Treaties and resolutions= The communities and Holy Places of Palestine have been under the express protection of international law since the early 19th century. For example, the International Court of Justice advisory opinion noted that access to the Christian, Jewish and Islamic Holy Places had been protected by various laws dating back to the early Ottoman Empire, with the latest provisions having been incorporated into the UN Partition Plan, article 13 of the League of Nations Mandate, and Article 62 of the Treaty of Berlin of 13 July 1878. The Treaty of Paris in 1814 called for a congress of the Great Powers of Europe to settle the future boundaries of the continent. Nearly every state in Europe was represented, and among other things a prohibition on unilateral annexation was adopted. This bolstered the concept of territorial integrity, which was enshrined in the Congress of Vienna in 1815. Benvenisti, Eyal, The Origins of the Concept of Belligerent Occupation. Law and History Review 26.3 (2008): 46 pars. 1 Jul. 2009 The 1856 Treaty of Paris declared that the Sublime Porte, the government of the Ottoman Empire, had been admitted to participate in the Public Law and System (Concert) of Europe.International Law: Achievements and Prospects, by Mohammed Bedjaoui (Editor), UNESCO, Martinus Nijhoff, 1991, , p. 7 The European system of public law governed territorial accessions and the creation of new states. After the Russo-Turkish Wars in 1878, Russia and the Ottoman Empire concluded the Treaty of San Stefano. Because it modified the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1856, the other signatories called for a Congress to obtain its revision. The Treaty of Berlin of 1878 was the result. Montenegro, Serbia, and Romania were recognized as new independent states and granted specific territory on condition that religious, political, and property rights of minorities were guaranteed on a nondiscriminatory basis.See Defending the Rights of Others: The Great Powers, the Jews, and International Minority Protection, 1878‚Äì1938, Carole Fink, Cambridge University Press, 2006, , p. 37 The delegates of the First Zionist Congress acknowledged these customary diplomatic precedents in the Basle Program. It stated that the aim of Zionism was the creation of a home for the Jewish people in Palestine, secured by public law. During the course of the British mandate in Palestine, the British government sought to reconcile the two claims in different ways. A number of proposals and declarations were put forward, all of which were rejected by one party or the other, and usually both. Again, two different interpretations apply: * The Israeli perspective is that the United Kingdom only had the mandate to propose solutions in keeping with the resolutions adopted at the San Remo Conference, not to amend them. In other words, that the relevant resolutions adopted at the San Remo Conference are the public law that awarded the Jewish people de jure sovereignty over Palestine. * The Arab perspective views British proposals as promises (subsequently broken) to the people of Palestine, see also the Hussein-McMahon Correspondence. After World War II, the British government decided to abandon its mandate in Palestine. A United Nations Commission (UNSCOP) was assigned to recommend a solution to the conflict to the General Assembly. The recommendation was a partition plan that would result in an Arab and a Jewish state in the remaining mandate, and Jerusalem under UN rule, was approved by the General Assembly. However, the resolution served partially as a basis for the Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel to take effect when Great Britain's mandate expired. Many states granted the State of Israel either de facto or de jure recognition. Israel was accepted as a sovereign member state in the United Nations and has diplomatic relations with many, but not all, sovereign states. =The legal consequence of subsequent events= Several events have affected the legal issues related to the conflict: * After the war in 1948, the mandate ended up being split between Israel, Egypt and Jordan. Israel and Jordan annexed all areas under their administration; Egypt maintained a military occupation of Gaza. The United Nations attempted to assert its authority over Jerusalem but the designated mediator, Count Bernadotte, was killed by the militant Zionist group Lehi while pursuing his official duties, and the city ended up being split between Israel and Jordan. Lehi had feared that Israel would agree to Bernadotte's peace proposals, which they considered disastrous, unaware that the provisional Israeli government had already rejected a proposal by Bernadotte the day before.A. Ilan, Bernadotte in Palestine, 1948 (Macmillan, 1989) p. 194 * Although there were numerous informal and backchannel communications between Israel and Arab states through the years, all Arab states refused to accept Israel's sovereignty until 1979, and most (excluding Jordan, Mauritania, and Egypt) persisted in rejecting Israel's desire to exist (see Khartoum Resolution) until the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative that offers Israel peace and normal relations with all Arab countries if Israel withdraws from all areas occupied in the 1967 war and \\"attain a just solution\\" to the Palestinian refugee problem \\"to be agreed upon in accordance with the UN General Assembly Resolution 194\\". * The war in 1967 brought all remaining parts of the Mandate (as defined by Great Britain in 1947) as well as the Sinai Peninsula and parts of the Golan Heights under Israeli administration. Israel subsequently effectively annexed East Jerusalem, asserting that the West Bank and Gaza were \\"disputed territories\\". The United Nations Security Council rejected the effective annexation of East Jerusalem and Golan Heights as \\"null and void\\" in United Nations Security Council Resolution 478 and United Nations Security Council Resolution 497 respectively, and consider Israel to hold the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Golan Heights under military occupation. * Both as a result of the wars in 1948 and 1967, Arab residents of the former Mandate were displaced and classified by the United Nations as \\"refugees\\". * In approximately the same time frame, most Jews in Arab states fled or were forced to leave, with most of them absorbed by Israel. * United Nations Security Council issued resolution 242 that set the framework for a resolution through \\"land for peace\\". * In 1979, Egypt and Israel signed a peace treaty, Israel returning Sinai in return for peace, agreeing on international borders between the two states, but leaving the disposition of Gaza for peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. * In 1988, the PLO declared \\"the establishment of the State of Palestine in the land of Palestine with its capital at Jerusalem.\\" Jordan relinquished its claims to the West Bank. * In 1993, the PLO and Israel signed a declaration of principles that included mutual recognition and the ultimate goal of establishing self rule for the Palestinian people. * In 1994, Jordan and Israel also signed a peace treaty. * No other Arab state has granted legal recognition of Israel's sovereignty. A formal state of war still exists between Israel and several Arab states, though armistice agreements govern interaction between the states. * Several attempts at finalizing the terms for a peace agreement between Israel and the PLO have failed. In 2006 the Palestinians elected Hamas into power, a party that does not recognize Israel as legitimate. Legal issues related to the wars Sovereign states have the right to defend themselves against overt external aggression, in the form of an invasion or other attack. A number of states assert that this principle extends to the right to launch military actions to reduce a threat, protect vital interests, or pre-empt a possible attack or emerging threat. =Wars between Israel and Arab states= Security Council resolution 242, emphasized \\"the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war,\\" setting the stage for controversy on the legal status of areas captured in 1967, and in 1948. There are two interpretations of this matter: * The Israeli position is that: ** The wars in 1956 and 1967 were waged by Israel to ensure the state's survival. As most hostilities were initiated by the Arab side, Israel had to fight and win these wars in order to ensure the state's sovereignty and safety. Territories captured in the course of those wars are therefore legitimately under Israeli administration for both security reasons and to deter hostile states from belligerence. ** In the absence of peace treaties between all the parties at war, Israel has under all circumstances the right to maintain control of the captured territories. Their ultimate disposition should be a result of peace treaties, and not a condition for them. Even so, Israel asserts that: *** The 1956 war was caused by a pattern of Egyptian belligerence against Israel, culminating with the nationalization of the Suez Canal and the blockage of the canal for Israeli traffic in violation of the Convention of Constantinople and other relevant treaties, in their view a clear casus belli (i.e., an act justifying war) *** The 1967 war was similarly caused by the closing of the Straits of Tiran, the rejection of UN forces in the Sinai desert, and the redeployment of Egyptian forces. Jordan and Syria entered the war in spite of Israeli efforts to keep these frontiers peaceful. *** The 1973 war was a surprise attack against Israel by Syria and Egypt. * The Arab position is that: ** The 1956 war came after an Israeli attack on the Gaza strip killing 25 Egyptian soldiers, and was a result of a conspiracy between France, the United Kingdom and Israel in violation of Egypt's sovereignty. Egypt claimed several legal justifications for refusing Israel use of the Suez Canal, including the right of self- defence. ** The war in 1967 was an unprovoked act of aggression aimed at expanding the boundaries of Israel, and the territories captured during this war are illegally occupied and this occupation must end. As noted above, Israel, Egypt, and Jordan have resolved this impasse and have recognized international borders between these states. The dispute has now shifted to the conflict between the Palestinians and Israel. Legal issues related to occupation The Geneva Conventions and other international tractates recognize that land a) conquered in the course of a war; and b) the disposition of which is unresolved through subsequent peace treaties is \\"occupied\\" and subject to international laws of war and international humanitarian law.Klapper, Bradley S. (November 13, 2008) \\"Switzerland says Israel breaking international law\\" Associated Press. -- \\"An Israeli Embassy spokeswoman [...] said the decision [...] was sanctioned by law.\\" This includes special protection of individuals in those territories, limitations on the use of land in those territories, and access by international relief agencies. =Jerusalem= Recognizing the controversial nature of sovereignty over Jerusalem, UNSCOP recommended that the city be placed under United Nations administration in the partition plan. This was approved by the General Assembly in November 1947, accepted by the Jews and rejected by the Arabs. However, the 1948‚Äì1949 war resulted in Israel occupying the western portion of the city. Israel made Jerusalem its capital in 1950, establishing governmental offices in areas it controlled. Soon afterward in 1950, Jordan annexed the eastern part along with the remainder of the West Bank. After the 1967 war, Israel put the parts of Jerusalem that had been captured during the war under its jurisdiction and civilian administration, establishing new municipal borders. Arguing that this did not amount to annexation at the time, subsequent legal actions have been interpreted as consistent with an annexation. On July 30, 1980, the Knesset passed a basic law making \\"Jerusalem, complete and united‚Ä¶the capital of Israel.\\" Since then Israel has extended the municipal boundaries several times. On October 6, 2002, Yasser Arafat signed the Palestinian Legislative Council's law making Al Quds \\"the eternal capital of Palestine.\\" International bodies such as the United Nations have condemned Israel's Basic Law concerning Jerusalem as a violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention and therefore hold that the establishment of the city as Israel's capital is against international law. Consequently, countries have established embassies to Israel's government outside of Jerusalem. Similarly, missions to the Palestinian National Authority are at the insistence of Israel's government located outside of Jerusalem. Israel has filed strenuous protests against this policy, asserting that: * There is no basis in international law for denying Israel's establishing its capital in Jerusalem, because there is no binding treaty that makes the city a Corpus separatum. * The 1980 Basic Law is not a legal innovation and only affirms Israel's long- standing position on Jerusalem. * Israel has the sovereign right to establish its capital at the most meaningful place for its people, and its claim is unique. * Objections to Jerusalem as Israel's capital are political in nature, and not legal. In its 2004 advisory opinion on the legality of the Israeli West Bank barrier, the International Court of Justice concluded that the lands captured by Israel in the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem, are occupied territory. =Settlement in territories= > See related articles Israeli settlement and International law and Israeli > settlements. Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention states in paragraph 1, > Individual or mass forcible transfers, as well as deportations of protected > persons from occupied territory to the territory of the Occupying Power or > to that of any other country, occupied or not, are prohibited, regardless of > their motive. and states in paragraph 6, > The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian > population into the territory it occupies. Arguments supporting the position that establishing, funding, or allowing settlements in the territories is a violation of international law are, * The International Committee of the Red Cross' commentaries to the Geneva Conventions state that Article 49, paragraph 6, \\"is intended to prevent a practice adopted during the Second World War by certain Powers, which transferred portions of their own population to occupied territory for political and racial reasons or in order, as they claimed, to colonize those territories.\\" It further notes \\"that in this paragraph the meaning of the words 'transfer' and 'deport' is rather different from that in which they are used in the other paragraphs of Article 49 since they do not refer to the movement of protected persons but to that of nationals of the occupying Power\\". The Committee has on several occasions described the establishment of Israeli settlements in the occupied territories as a violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention. * the International Court of Justice, in paragraph 120 of its advisory opinion on the \\"Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory\\", asserts that: \\"That provision [article 49(6)] prohibits not only deportations or forced transfers of population such as those carried out during the Second World War, but also any measures taken by an occupying Power in order to organize or encourage transfers of parts of its own population into the occupied territory\\" and \\"concludes that the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (including East Jerusalem) have been established in breach of international law\\". The dissenting judge Thomas Buergenthal agreed that \\"this provision applies to the Israeli settlements in the West Bank and that their existence violates Article 49, paragraph 6\\". * Article 8(2)(b)(viii) of the International Criminal Court Rome Statute defines \\"[t]he transfer, directly or indirectly, by the Occupying Power of parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies\\" as a war crime. Israel did initially sign the statute, but later declared its intention not to ratify it. * The Security Council has in Resolution 446 determined: \\"that the policy and practices of Israel in establishing settlements in the Palestinian and other Arab territories occupied since 1967 have no legal validity\\". Arguments supporting the position that settlement in the territories does not violate international law are, * Israel ministry of foreign affairs argues \\"As the West Bank and Gaza Strip were not under the legitimate and recognized sovereignty of any state prior to the Six Day War, they should not be considered occupied territories.\\" * Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention is limited to transfers or deportations into or out of Occupied Territories which are 'forcible'. * Article 49 \\"cannot be viewed as prohibiting the voluntary return of individuals to the towns and villages from which they, or their ancestors, had been ousted\\" from living, e.g., in Gush Etzion, Jerusalem, or Hebron before 1948. * The Palestinians, as part of the Oslo Accords , agreed that the issue of settlements in the territories shall fall under the jurisdiction of final status negotiations (Article V, Section 3). * Jews have a legal right to settle the areas according to the Mandate for Palestine (specifically Article 6 of the mandate concerning Jewish settlements) and to such documents as the Faisal Weizmann Agreement. The British Mandate (granted by the League of Nations) specifically encouraged \\"close settlement by Jews on the land.\\" Legal issues related to the Israeli West Bank barrier :See related article Israeli West Bank barrier. Israel has completed long stretches of barriers within the West Bank, separating Israel proper, Israeli settlements and large parts of the Palestinian territories from Palestinian cities and population centers. * Those who question the legality of the barrier make the following arguments: ** The barrier has been found to be illegal by the legal arm of the United Nations (the International Court of Justice). ** At various locations, the selected route of the barrier required the demolition of homes and the expulsion of the residents of those homes, in violation of Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention. ** The barrier and Israel's series of checkpoints have made life nearly impossible for residents of the West Bank, constituting collective punishment. Article 33 of the Fourth Geneva Convention categorize collective punishment in occupied territories as a war crime. ** At various locations, the selected route of the barrier required the demolition of Palestinian property, in violation of article 53 of the Fourth Geneva Conventions. ** The barrier is an attempt to establish de facto borders between Israel and a future Palestinian state, in effect annexing large parts of West Bank and all of East Jerusalem, in violation of numerous United Nations Security Council Resolutions. ** The barrier attempts to separate Palestinians from their means of livelihood and from interaction with others and it, therefore, qualifies as apartheid. Apartheid is illegal as per the 2002 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and is considered a crime against humanity (see also: Israel and the apartheid analogy). ** The barrier is constructed inside of the West Bank, making it completely in violation of international law. ** The barrier differs from all other protective barriers built by any other state (such as the Berlin Wall, or the US-Mexico border) in that it is not constructed on the border between states but rather crosses the occupied territories in numerous locations, and with existing/expanding settlements, divides the occupied territories into 4 or 5 cantons. * Israel defends the security barrier by arguing that: ** The barrier and its route are solely security measures that will have no bearing on future peace negotiations. ** The land is not subject to the Geneva Conventions. ** The Geneva Conventions explicitly allows structures to be built for purposes of self-defense. ** The Israeli Supreme Court is reviewing the route on a continuous basis and has forced it to change. ** StandWithUs, a pro-Israel advocacy organization, defends the security fence by pointing out: *** Israel did not begin building the fence until 2003 when terrorism reached unprecedented levels. *** The fence is similar to barriers that dozens of other democracies have built to keep out terrorists or illegal immigrants, such as the barriers between the United States and Mexico, India and Kashmir, Spain and Morocco, North and South Korea and even the walls within Belfast that separate Protestant and Catholic neighborhoods. *** Since construction of the fence began in 2003, the number of completed terrorist attacks has dropped by more than 90%. *** 97% of the barrier is a chain-link fence similar to those along the United States's border; only 3% (10 miles) is a concrete wall, built to prevent sniper shooting prevalent in certain areas. *** Only 5%‚Äì8% of the West Bank and less than 1% of Palestinians will end up on the Israeli side of the fence. *** Palestinians can bring their specific grievances about the barrier to Israel's Supreme Court, which in several cases has ruled that the fence must be re- routed. In 2004, the United Nations passed a number of resolutions and the International Court of Justice issued a ruling where judges ruled 14‚Äì1 that the portions of the Israeli West Bank barrier that are located within occupied Palestinian territories are illegal under international law.Falk, Richard (July 20, 2004). \\"Support for Wall Mocks International law\\". Miami Herald. -- \\"What is most remarkable about the International Court of Justice decision [...] is the strength of the consensus behind it. By a vote of 14‚Äì1, the 15 distinguished jurists who make up the highest judicial body on the planet found that the barrier is illegal under international law [...] The International Court of Justice has very rarely reached this degree of unanimity in big cases. The July 9 decision was even supported by the generally conservative British judge Rosalyn Higgins\\". Prior to the ruling, Israel had made the claim that the ICJ lacked standing to rule on the legality of the barrier, which the court unanimously rejected. On July 20, 2004, the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution demanding that Israel obey the ICJ ruling. 150 nations voted in favor of the resolution, 7 voted against, and 10 abstained. =United Nations= In October 2003, the United States vetoed a United Nations Security Council resolution, which stated: > The construction by Israel, the occupying power, of a wall in the Occupied > Territories departing from the armistice line of 1949 is illegal under > relevant provisions of international law and must be ceased and reversed. The United Kingdom, Germany, Bulgaria, and Cameroon abstained from the vote. The justification given by the U.S. for the veto was that the resolution did not condemn terrorist attacks made by Palestinian groups (see Negroponte doctrine). The United States, however, has been condemned by some countries for its support of the barrier. One week later, on October 21, a similar (though non-binding) resolution (ES-10/13) was passed by the UN General Assembly 144‚Äì4 with 12 abstentions. The resolution said the barrier was \\"in contradiction to international law\\", and demanded that Israel \\"stop and reverse\\" its construction. Israel called the resolution a \\"farce\\". The United Nations General Assembly has voted on a resolution bearing on issues of international law as applied to the conflict every year since 1974. =Process of the ICJ= In December 2003, the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution requesting the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to make a non- binding advisory opinion on the \\"legal consequences arising\\" from the construction of the barrier. The hearings began in February 2004. The Palestinian Authority is not a member of the court but was allowed to make a submission by virtue of being a UN observer and a co-sponsor of the General Assembly resolution. In January 2004, the court also authorized the League of Arab States and the Organisation of the Islamic Conference to make submissions. Israel initially announced that it would cooperate with the court, while noting that advisory rulings of the ICJ are not binding. Israel later made a written submission to the court rejecting the authority of the court to rule on the case, but announced (on February 12, 2004) that it would not appear at the court to make oral submissions. On January 30, 2004, Israel announced officially it did not recognize ICJ authority to rule over the barrier issue. Israel also dispatched a 120-page document, elaborating on the security needs to build the \\"terror prevention fence\\" and purporting to demonstrate the atrocities committed by Palestinian terrorists. The document also included a judicial part with legal accounts supporting Israel's claim that the issue of the barrier is political and not in the ICJ authority. On 23, 24, and 25 February 2004 the hearings before the International Court of Justice took place in the Peace Palace at the Hague. =Ruling of the ICJ= Graffiti on the barrier, reading \\"Illegal.\\" On July 9, 2004, the International Court of Justice issued its opinion against the barrier, calling for it to be removed and the Arab residents to be compensated for any damage done. The Court advised that the United Nations General Assembly, which had asked for the ruling, and the Security Council should act on the issue. A summary of the ruling is as follows:Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory , International Court of Justice Advisory Opinion, July 9, 2004, paragraph 163. # The construction of the wall by the occupying power Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including around East Jerusalem and its regime are \\"contrary to international law‚Äù. # Israel is obligated to stop construction of the wall, including around East Jerusalem and to dismantle the structure, and to repeal all legislative and regulatory acts relating to the wall. # Israel is obligated to \\"make reparation for all damages caused\\" by the wall, including around East Jerusalem‚Äù. # All states are under an obligation not to recognize the illegal wall and \\"not to render aid or assistance in maintaining the situation\\", and to \\"ensure compliance by Israel with international humanitarian law\\" in accordance with the Fourth Geneva Convention relating to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War 1949, while \\"respecting the United Nations Charter and international law, as embodied in that convention‚Äù\\". # The United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council should consider what further action is required to bring to an end the illegal wall and the associated regime.‚Äù The opinion was passed 14-1 by the court judges, except for the 4th decision which was passed 13‚Äì2. Thomas Buergenthal, the American judge, was the sole dissenting member of the 15 judges on this ICJ panel. In his declaration, he stated that there was much in the court's opinion with which he agreed but that the court should have declined to hear the case since it did not have before it \\"relevant facts bearing directly on issues of Israel's legitimate right of self-defense\\". He stated that his dissenting opinion \\"should not be seen as reflecting my view that the construction of the wall by Israel on the Occupied Palestinian Territory does not raise serious questions as a matter of international law.\\" On the point of portions of the wall that were being built beyond the green line, which Israel stated were to defend settlements, Buergenthal stated: > Paragraph 6 of Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention also does not > admit exceptions on grounds of military or security exigencies. It provides > that \\"the Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own > civilian population into the territory it occupies\\". I agree that this > provision applies to the Israeli settlements in the West Bank and that their > existence violates Article 49, paragraph 6. It follows that the segments of > the wall being built by Israel to protect the settlements are ipso facto in > violation of international humanitarian law. Moreover, given the > demonstrable great hardship to which the affected Palestinian population is > being subjected in and around the enclaves created by those segments of the > wall, seriously doubt that the wall would here satisfy the proportionality > requirement to qualify as a legitimate measure of self-defence. =Reaction to the ICJ= The opinion was accepted by the United Nations General Assembly, on July 20, 2004, it passed a resolution demanding that Israel obey the ICJ ruling. Israel, the US, Australia, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau voted against the resolution, 10 nations abstained, and 150 nations voted in favor. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said: \\"This is an excellent decision. This is a victory for the Palestinian people and for all the free peoples of the world.\\" Israel rejected the ICJ ruling and emphasized the barrier's self-defense aspect , and stressed that Israel will continue to build the barrier. The United States also rejected the ruling, declaring that the issue was of political rather than legal nature. Colin Powell stated that barrier was effective against terror, and noted that the ICJ ruling was not binding, but insisted that Israel not use the barrier to predetermine permanent borders. Numerous human rights organizations welcomed the ICJ ruling. Amnesty International said that Israel should immediately cease constructing the barrier. The governments of Israel's neighbors Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and Egypt also welcomed the ruling. On July 13, 2004, the US House of Representatives passed Resolution HR 713 deploring \\"the misuse of the International Court of Justice (ICJ)... for the narrow political purpose of advancing the Palestinian position on matters Palestinian authorities have said should be the subject of negotiations between the parties.\\" The Resolution further stated that twenty-three countries, including every member of the G8 and several other European states, had \\"submitted objections on various grounds against the ICJ hearing the case.\\" Legal issues related to refugees =Legal definition of refugee= The tractate that is most often invoked for legally defining refugees is the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. The definition of \\"refugee\\" is most often summarized as > ... a person who is outside his/her country of nationality or habitual > residence; has a well-founded fear of persecution because of his/her race, > religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political > opinion; and is unable or unwilling to avail himself/herself of the > protection of that country, or to return there, for fear of persecution. The > convention is administered by the United Nations High Commissioner for > Refugees (UNHCR). The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), which was established prior to the 1951 convention in response to the humanitarian crisis, applies a different definition: > Under UNRWA's operational definition, Palestine refugees are persons whose > normal place of residence was Palestine between June 1946 and May 1948, who > lost both their homes and means of livelihood as a result of the 1948 > Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict. UNRWA's services are available to all those living in > its area of operations who meet this definition, who are registered with the > Agency and who need assistance. UNRWA's definition of a refugee also covers > the descendants of persons who became refugees in 1948. Since the definition used by UNRWA was originally made on an operational basis rather than dictated by specific international law, obligations and rights related to Palestinian refugees under international law are a matter of some debate. The debate centers on questions such as: whether the status of refugees can properly be passed through inheritance to individuals who have never lived in the vacated areas, and whether individuals who have repatriated in other countries can legally claim refugee status. Palestinian refugees were excluded from the 1951 Convention due to the clause that \\"This Convention shall not apply to persons who are at present receiving from organs or agencies of the United Nations other than the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees protection or assistance.\\" As interpreted by UNHCR, this caused some anomalies, since UNRWA admits some persons as refugees that are not automatically admitted by the Convention, and, conversely, some of the legal protections given to refugees by the Convention were not available to most Palestinians. In 2002, UNHCR adopted a revised interpretation that fills some of these gaps. The BADIL Resource Center for Palestinian Residency and Refugee Rights published a critical analysis of UNHCR revised interpretation of the 1951 Refugee Convention.

Orville Wright made the first flight with it on June 23, 1905. The Flyer III had an airframe of spruce construction with a wing camber of 1-in-20 as used in 1903, rather than the less effective 1-in-25 used in 1904. The new machine was equipped with the engine and other hardware from the scrapped Flyer II and‚Äîafter major modifications‚Äîachieved much greater performance than Flyers I and II. Design and development As initially built, the Flyer III looked almost the same as its predecessors and offered equally marginal performance. Orville suffered minor injuries in a serious nose-dive crash in the machine on July 14, 1905. When rebuilding the airplane, the Wrights made important design changes that solved the stability problems of the earlier models. They almost doubled the size of the elevator and rudder and moved them about twice the distance from the wings. They added two fixed half-moon shaped vertical vanes (called \\"blinkers\\") between the elevators (but later removed) and widened the skid- undercarriage which helped give the wings a very slight dihedral. They disconnected the rudder of the rebuilt Flyer III from the wing-warping control, and as in most future aircraft, placed it on a separate control handle. They also installed a larger fuel tank and mounted two radiators on front and back struts for extra coolant to the engine for the anticipated lengthy duration flights. When testing of Flyer III resumed in September, improvement was obvious. The pitch instability that had hampered Flyers I and II was brought under control. Crashes, some of which had been severe, no longer occurred. Flights with the redesigned aircraft started lasting over 20 minutes. The Flyer III became practical and dependable, flying reliably for significant durations and bringing its pilot back to the starting point safely and landing without damage. On October 5, 1905 Wilbur made a circling flight of 24 miles (38.9 km) in 39 minutes 23 seconds, over Huffman Prairie, longer than the total duration of all the flights of 1903 and 1904. Four days later, they wrote to the United States Secretary of War William Howard Taft, offering to sell the world's first practical fixed-wing aircraft. =Flying at Kill Devil Hills= The Wright Flyer III in its two-seat configuration at the Kill Devil Hills, May 1908. Take-offs were made from the monorail launch track; the catapult and derrick were not used. This is the only surviving Wright brothers photo of the airplane in this configuration. A news photographer took a picture of the aircraft in flight from a distance, but very few details are visible. To keep their knowledge from falling into competitors' hands, the Wrights stopped flying and disassembled the airplane on November 7, 1905.\\"1905 ‚Äì The First Practical Airplane , U.S. Centennial of Flight Commission, Retrieved on 2010-06-05. Two and a half years later, having won American and French contracts to sell their airplane, they refurbished the Flyer with seats for a pilot and passenger, equipped it with upright control levers and installed one of their new 35-horsepower in-line vertical engines. They shipped it to North Carolina and made practice flights near Kill Devil Hills from May 6 to 14, 1908 to test the new controls and the Flyer's passenger- carrying abilities. On May 14, 1908, Wilbur flew mechanic Charles Furnas (1880‚Äì1941) in 29 seconds, making him the first airplane passenger. The same day, Orville also flew with Furnas, this time in 4 minutes 2 seconds. Orville's flight with Furnas was seen by newspaper reporters hiding among the sand dunes; they mistakenly thought Wilbur and Orville were flying together. He is one of the few people to fly with both Wright brothers (their sister Katharine being another). Later that day, Wilbur was flying solo when he moved one of the new control levers the wrong way and crashed into the sand, suffering bruises. The Flyer's front elevator was wrecked and the practice flights ended. Due to deadlines for their upcoming public demonstration flights in France and Virginia, the Wrights did not repair the airplane and it never flew again. Survivors The Wright Flyer III was left in its damaged condition in the North Carolina hangar. In 1911 the Berkshire Museum of Pittsfield, Massachusetts, through one Zenas Crane, obtained most of the components from both the abandoned Flyer and the 1911 Wright glider, but never assembled or exhibited them. The parts of the 1905 aircraft remained in Massachusetts for almost forty years, until Orville requested their return in 1946 for the Flyer's restoration as a central exhibit at Edward A. Deeds' Carillon Park in Dayton, Ohio. Some Kitty Hawk residents also possessed pieces of the 1905 airplane; Deeds and Orville also obtained many of these for the restoration. At the end of the 1947‚Äì1950 restoration process, craftsmen estimated that the 1905 aircraft retained between 60 and 85% of its original material. The 1905 airplane is now displayed in the Wright Brothers Aviation Center at Carillon Historical Park. The aircraft and display are part of the Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park. The restored 1905 Wright Flyer III is the only fixed-wing aircraft to be designated a National Historic Landmark. =Found artifact= Start of the first flight of Flyer III, June 23, 1905, Orville at the controls. The catapult tower, which they began using in September 1904, is at right. It helped accelerate the aircraft to takeoff speed. The Flyer looks virtually identical to the previous two powered versions, but noticeably different from its later appearance, after the Wrights extended and enlarged the elevator and rudder. The two men are probably Wilbur (running behind the airplane) and Charles Edward Taylor (at right), the Wrights' mechanic who built their first aircraft engine. A historic missing piece of the Flyer III, thought to be a piece of the original Wright Flyer, turned up in 2010 in the hands of Palmer Wood, whose uncle, Thomas, had given him the piece in the 1960s. Wood took the piece to Brian Coughlin, an aircraft collector, who, not knowing what the piece was, took it to Peter Jakab of the Smithsonian Institution. The missing piece is the actuator, which connects the moment chain or arm (the Wrights still used chain link in 1905) to the front elevator. In the 1940s Orville gathered all of the stray pieces of the Flyer that were not in Massachusetts from Kitty Hawk locals who, as children, raided the Wrights' 1908 hangar for souvenirs. The actuator piece, which more than likely broke away in Wilbur's sand dune crash of May 14, 1908, somehow missed Orville's gathering efforts and was replaced with a solid or flanged piece which the Wrights did not start using until 1908. According to Peter Jakab the flanged piece is not accurate to the 1905 configuration of the Flyer III. The Wrights in 1905 used a wood assembly joined together by small flat plates and screws. The solid flat piece now on the Flyer was substituted in the 1947‚Äì1950 restoration for the missing actuator.Air & Space Magazine, Smithsonian Institution issue January 2011 page 13 article title \\"The Wrong Wright Part\\" by Patricia Trenner Specifications (Flyer III) Ohio 50 State Quarter features the 1905 Wright Flyer III built and flown in Ohio, as shown in the famous photo from Huffman Prairie See also References ;Notes ;Bibliography * External links *Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park *Information on mechanic Charles Furnas(updated using Wayback Machine) *Modern flying replica of Wright Flyer III *Rescue and preservation of Wright Flyer III by Jeanne Palermo *Wright Brothers Flight Logs Canard aircraft National Register of Historic Places in Greene County, Ohio Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmarks National Historic Landmarks in Ohio Prone pilot aircraft 1900s United States experimental aircraft Flyer III Single-engined twin-prop pusher aircraft Aircraft on the National Register of Historic Places National Register of Historic Places in Ohio Aircraft first flown in 1905 ","title":"Wright Flyer III"},{"id":"1368591","text":"Interview is an American magazine founded in late 1969 by artist Andy Warhol and British journalist John Wilcock. The magazine, nicknamed \\"The Crystal Ball of Pop\\", features interviews with celebrities, artists, musicians, and creative thinkers. Interviews were usually unedited or edited in the eccentric fashion of Warhol's books and The Philosophy of Andy Warhol: From A to B and Back Again. History Covers displayed in the Andy Warhol Museum =Andy Warhol period= In the early days, complimentary copies of Interview were often given away to the \\"in-crowd\\"; this was the start of the magazine's circulation. Toward the end of his life, as Warhol withdrew from everyday oversight of his magazine, a more conventional editorial style was introduced under editor Bob Colacello. However, Warhol continued to act as ambassador for the magazine, distributing issues in the street to passersby and creating ad hoc signing events on the streets of Manhattan, New York City. The creative covers of Interview which gave the magazine its signature style were done by artist Richard Bernstein from 1972 to 1989. =Brant Publications period= The magazine's format has remained consistent at 60% features and 40% glossy advertising. It has been published by Brant Publications, Inc since shortly after Warhol's death in 1987. It was helmed for 18 years by Ingrid Sischy, until she and Peter Brant's ex-wife Sandra became lovers and left the magazine, selling Ms. Brant's half-ownership stake in the parent company Brant Publications. For a year and a half the magazine was in flux, edited by Christopher Bollen. =2008 to 2018= Interview restarted under co-editorial directors Fabien Baron and Glenn O'Brien in September 2008, with a cover featuring Kate Moss. Stephen Mooallem and Christopher Bollen served as the working editor-in-chief and editor-at-large, respectively. The publication's content can be found online and via an app, Other Edition, available on iTunes. As of 2017, Fabien Baron was the editorial director; Karl Templer was creative director; Nick Haramis was editor-in-chief. In December 2013, Stephen Mooallem left Interview to join Harper‚Äôs Bazaar as its executive editor. Keith Pollock served as editor-in-chief from 2014 to 2016. It was announced on May 21, 2018 that the publication ‚Äòfolded‚Äô and would end both its print and web publications by the end of 2018. The publication also filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy and liquidation. = Relaunch = On September 6, 2018, Interview announced the launch of its 521st issue. The magazine was purchased by Kelly Brant and Jason Nikic, with some reports suggesting that the title's intellectual property will be returned to Peter Brant. In other media and popular culture The magazine is featured in The CW's television series The Carrie Diaries, a prequel to HBO's Sex and the City. The protagonist, played by actress AnnaSophia Robb, vicariously explores New York City through the fashion editor of Interview, played by Freema Agyeman.

The story, commonly known as \\"Adapa and the South Wind\\", is known from fragmentary tablets from Tell el-Amarna in Egypt (around 14th century BC) and from finds from the Library of Ashurbanipal, Assyria (around 7th century BC). Adapa was an important figure in Mesopotamian religion. His name would be used to invoke power in exorcism rituals. He also became an archetype for a wise ruler. In that context, his name would be invoked to evoke favorable comparisons. Some scholars conflate Adapa and the Apkallu known as Uanna. There is some evidence for that connection, but the name \\"adapa\\" may have also been used as an epithet, meaning \\"wise\\". Overview Adapa's story was initially known from a find at Amarna in Egypt from the archives of Egyptian King Amenophis IV (1377‚Äì1361 BC). By 1912, three finds from the Library of Ashurbanipal (668‚Äì626 BC) had been interpreted and found to contain parts of the story. As of 2001 five fragments from the library are known. There are differences in several of the known versions of the text. Based on a catalogue of texts, a possible original title, an incipit, may have been Adapa into heaven. A modern analysis of the development of the main Adapa tale is by =Summary= :Summary based on translations in , , Adapa was a mortal man, a sage or priest of the temple of Ea in the city of Eridu. Ea (sometimes considered his father) had given Adapa the gift of great wisdom but not eternal life. While carrying out his duties, he was fishing the Persian Gulf. The sea became rough by the strong wind, and his boat was capsized. Angry, Adapa \\"broke the wings of the south wind\\" preventing it from blowing for seven days. The god Anu called Adapa to account for his action, but Ea aided him by instructing Adapa to gain the sympathy of Tammuz and Gishzida, who guard the gates of heaven and not to eat or drink there, as such food might kill him. When offered garments and oil, he should put the clothes on and anoint himself. Adapa puts on mourning garments, tells Tammuz and Gishzida to be in mourning because they have disappeared from the land. Adapa is then offered the \\"food of life\\" and \\"water of life\\" but will not eat or drink. Then garments and oil are offered, and he does what he had been told. He is brought before Anu, who asks why he will not eat or drink. Adapa replies that Ea told him not to. Anu laughs at Ea's actions, and passes judgment on Adapa by asking rhetorically, \\"What ill has he [Adapa] brought on mankind?\\" He adds that men will suffer disease as a consequence, which Ninkarrak (Nintinugga) may allay. Adapa is then sent back down to earth. The ending of the text is missing. =Other myths= Adapa is also associated with the king Enmerkar (the known text is very fragmentary). In the portions that are known, Adapa and Enmerkar descend into the earth (nine cubits down), and are involved in breaking into an ancient tomb. What happens in there is not clear, but the outcome is that they leave and reseal the tomb. =Legacy= The name of Adapa became pervasive in some rituals of the Mesopotamian religion. According to exorcists would state \\"I am Adapa!\\" in their rituals. Rituals from Nippur dating to as early as around 1800 BC use Adapa's name in their incantations. Derivatives of the text remained in use until at least the 1st century AD. During the Neo- Assyrian period, comparisons to Adapa would be used in reference to the king and so were used to legitimize that king. For example, it was written in Sennacherib's Annals, \\"Ea [..] endowed me with vast knowledge equivalent to that of the Sage Adapa\\". Interpretation =as Uanna/Oannes= The name Adapa has also been used for the first Apkallu, sometimes known as Uanna (in the Greek work by Berossus called Oannes). The accounts of the two are different, and (Uanna) the Apkallu is half-fish, while Adapa is a fisherman. However, there may be a connection. One potential explanation for the occurrence of the two names together is that the cuneiform for 'adapa' was also used as an appellative for \\"wise\\" (the Apkallu being wisdom giving beings). Alternative viewpoints exist as to whether 'adapa' should be considered an epithet for 'uanna' or the other way around. Both occur together in compound as the name of the first apkullu. If identified as the first Apkallu, Adapa would have been the adviser of the mythical first (antediluvian) king of Eridu, Alulim. That connection is found in some texts, with King Alulu (Ref STT 176+185, lines 14-15). Elsewhere, he is associated with the much-later King Enmerkar. =as Adam= When the story of Adapa was first rediscovered some scholars saw a resemblance with the story of the biblical Adam, such as Albert Tobias Clay. Later scholars such as Alexander Heidel (\\"The Adapa legend and the Biblical story (of Adam) are fundamentally as far apart as antipodes\\") rejected this connection; however, potential connections are still (1981) considered worthy of analysis. Possible parallels and connections include similarity in names, including the possible connection of both to the same word root; both accounts include a test involving the eating of purportedly deadly food; and both are summoned before god to answer for their transgressions.

Their style blends progressive rock, art rock, metal, medieval influences, and eastern music. History Formed in September 1991, the band began when founding member Frank Hart moved from Missouri and joined forces with producer/manager Sam Taylor. The lineup consisting of Frank, Jonathan Marshall, Mark Poindexter, and Len Sonnier (brother of Dane Sonnier of the Galactic Cowboys), was fleshed out with a few different Houston-area musicians over the next few years. In December 1991, Atomic Opera went into Rampart recording studio with producer Sam Taylor, and Engineer Steve Ames to record a demo consisting of the songs \\"For Madmen Only\\", \\"Daze of Love In Grey\\", \\"The Meaningless Word\\" and \\"everdream\\". They recorded more demos at Rampart in 1992. In September 1992, Sonnier quit the band, and was replaced on bass by his good friend and bass tech, Jonas Velasco. In 1994, after Derek Shulman, president of Collision Arts (a subsidiary of Giant Records) saw the band play live at Zelda's in Houston, he signed them the spot. Soon, they released their first full album, For Madmen Only. During this time, the band toured with such artists as Dio and King's X. The band's video for \\"Justice\\" was played approximately 20 times on MTV. Often compared with King's X (who was also managed and produced by Taylor) or the Galactic Cowboys, Atomic Opera forged their own path with poetic lyrics, varied instruments, and strong Christian influences. Unlike some of their contemporaries, the band did little to hide its faith in its lyrics, but in some ways avoided the stereotypes of Christian rock, as most songs focused on challenging the norms of Christianity and on the relationship between God and man. The band was also vocal about their dislike of the Christian music industry. The band's label Collision Arts ceased operations, and Atomic Opera found itself without a home, and released their next two albums without a supporting label. After struggling to gain mainstream popularity, the band broke up in 1995 and parted ways with Taylor. Hart continued to write music and decided to release a follow up album in 1997 under the Atomic Opera name called Penguin Dust, recruiting former drummer Mark Poindexter and multi-instrumentalist Kemper Crabb to assist; this album was released directly by Hart and shopped to various independent outlets. Due to the strength of Penguin Dust, Metal Blade Records quickly signed the band to a long term deal. Crabb became a full-time member, with longtime Hart friends John Simmons and Ryan Birsinger also rounding out the lineup. While working on new material, Hart compiled the album Alpha and Oranges, a collection of unreleased demos originally from the For Madmen Only lineup, and released this independently as well. In 2000, the band released Gospel Cola on Metal Blade with its new lineup; the album garnered some positive notice in both Christian and mainstream music outlets. Since that time, the band have endured a lot of setbacks (such as a flooded recording studio) and pursued various side projects (such as raising families, session work, multimedia projects, Hart's role as worship leader at a Houston area church, and managing Hart's label Feverdream Records). After adding Trip Wamsley to the lineup in 2004, and parting ways with Metal Blade, the band were working on a new album called The Mystery of Hope, but there has been no news on this effort for several years. The band did have a reunion concert in late 2014 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the release of For Madmen Only, in addition to re- releasing a remaster of the album with bonus tracks.

It was a very progressive school where pupils \\"didn't have to go to any lessons, so I didn't. I spent 15 grand, all my money, and it was just stupid really\\". After this, she attended cookery school.Jivani, Alkarim, Time Out, 11‚Äì18 December 1996 Career Coleman's first major television role was as Sue in Southern Television's Worzel Gummidge. This ran for four series (and a Christmas special) from 1978 to 1981 on the ITV network. Other early work included A Choice of Evils (Play for Today, BBC, 1977) and Two People (London Weekend Television, 1979), as Emma Moffatt). She had a crush on Stephen Garlick, her co-star in Two People. For the role, she had to choose a stuffed toy for Emma to carry; she named it \\"Haggis\\" and still had it when interviewed in 1990. This was soon followed by her role as the teenage rebel Marmalade Atkins, firstly in Marmalade Atkins in Space (a one-off drama shown in 1981), and then in two series, Educating Marmalade (1982‚Äì83) and Danger: Marmalade at Work (1984). All three were made by Thames Television and written by Andrew Davies. In 1990, Coleman appeared as Jess, a teenage girl from Lancashire brought up by a strict Pentecostal mother, in the acclaimed BBC television drama Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit, based on Jeanette Winterson's novel of the same name. Coleman won a Royal Television Society, Best Actress award and was nominated for a BAFTA for her portrayal of the young lesbian character. She also read the novel for release by BBC Audiobooks. Other television appearances in the 1980s and '90s included roles in Thames Television's The Bill and Central Independent Television's Inspector Morse, the short-lived comedy series Freddie and Max, with Anne Bancroft, a drama about homelessness, Sweet Nothing and another lesbian role, as Barbara Gale in the political satire Giving Tongue (1996). She also appeared in Simon Nye's sitcom How Do You Want Me? (1998‚Äì2000), alongside Dylan Moran and Emma Chambers, and voiced the lead female character, Primrose, in the animated adaptation of Brambly Hedge.\\"TV Toons: Brambly Hedge (1996‚Äì2000)\\" Toonhound.com, 2008 Coleman's final television appearance was in the adaptation of Jacqueline Wilson's Double Act, where she played the twins' teacher, Miss Debenham. Coleman played Scarlett in the film Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994) with Hugh Grant, Simon Callow and Kristin Scott Thomas. She received a BAFTA Film Award nomination for this part, losing to Thomas. Coleman continued to act in films throughout the 1990s with her last major film being Jasmin Dizdar's Beautiful People (1999), set in London in 1993, at the time of the Yugoslav Wars, playing the role of Portia Thornton.Walker, John, (ed) \\"Halliwell's Who's Who in the Movies\\" (fourth edition), HarperCollins, 2006 () =Theatre= Coleman portrayed the character of the teenage Lorna in Our Own Kind (Roy MacGregor), at the Bush Theatre in London (April 1991).

Personal life In 1987 Coleman's boyfriend, Jonathan Laycock, died as the result of a cycling accident. He was 23 years old. After his death Coleman went through periods of depression, and developed the eating disorders anorexia and bulimia. =Death= On 13 November 2001, Coleman visited her family where they watched a film together. Her father later stated that she had been in great spirits because of her new flat in Holloway, north London, which she had decorated, and there was a possibility of a career upturn after a few years of a stall. Later that evening she complained of feeling unwell, but went home to her flat against her parents' advice. The next morning, Wednesday, 14 November 2001, her parents telephoned her to see if she was feeling better; but there was no reply. Concerned, her mother went to Coleman's flat only to find her lying unconscious on the floor; her asthma inhaler was in a different room. She was taken by ambulance to Whittington Hospital in north London, where she was pronounced dead on arrival from a massive attack of bronchial asthma. A memorial was held at the Mill Hill Buddhist Centre in north London later that month and attended by family and close friends.

Its designation as a battle is a mere historical formality: there was no fighting and there were no casualties. The Romans were trapped in an enclosed valley by the Samnites before they knew what was happening and nothing remained but to negotiate an unfavorable surrender. The action was entirely political, with the magistrates on both sides trying to obtain the best terms for their side without disrespecting common beliefs concerning the rules of war and the conduct of peace. In the end the Samnites decided it would be better for future relations to let the Romans go, while the Romans were impeded in the prosecution of their campaign against the Samnites by considerations of religion and honor.  Description  According to Livy's account, the Samnite commander, Gaius Pontius, hearing that the Roman army was located near Calatia, sent ten soldiers disguised as herdsmen with orders to give the same story, which was that the Samnites were besieging Lucera in Apulia. The Roman commanders, completely taken in by this ruse, decided to set off to give aid to Lucera. Worse, they chose the quicker route, along a road later to become the Appian Way, through the Caudine Forks (Furculae Caudinae), a narrow mountain pass near Benevento, Campania. The area round the Caudine Forks was surrounded by mountains and could be entered only by two defiles. The Romans entered by one; but when they reached the second defile they found it barricaded. They returned at once to the first defile only to find it now securely held by the Samnites. At this point the Romans, according to Livy, fell into total despair, knowing the situation was quite hopeless. The Samnites had no idea what to do to take advantage of their success. Hence Pontius was persuaded to send a letter to his father, Herennius. The reply came back that the Romans should be sent on their way, unharmed, as quickly as possible. This advice was rejected, and a further letter was sent to Herennius. This time the advice was to kill the Romans down to the last man. Not knowing what to make of such contradictory advice, the Samnites then asked Herennius to come in person to explain. When Herennius arrived he explained that were they to set the Romans free without harm, they would gain the Romans' friendship. If they killed the entire Roman army, then Rome would be so weakened that they would not pose a threat for many generations. At this his son asked was there not a middle way. Herennius insisted that any middle way would be utter folly and would leave the Romans smarting for revenge without weakening them. Modern historians have cast doubt on the details of Livy's account.Horsfall, Nicholas (1982) \\"The Caudine Forks: Topography and Illusion\\". Papers of the British School at Rome, Vol. 50 (1982), pp. 45-52. Neither defile leading to the central plain is as narrow and steep as Livy's dramatic description would suggest. The western defile (near the town of Arienzo) is over a kilometre wide, and it is unlikely that the Samnites would have had time to block it effectively in the brief time the Romans would have taken to cross the plain to the eastern defile (near Arpaia) and return. (The distance is 4.5 km, or just under 3 miles.) Even the eastern end, which is narrower, is wide enough to make it possible to march through while keeping out of range of missiles thrown from the hills on either side. Horsfall suggests that Livy's geography may have been influenced by accounts of the campaigns of Alexander the Great which were contemporary with this event.  Aftermath  According to Livy, Pontius was unwilling to take the advice of his father and insisted that the Romans surrender and pass under a yoke. This was agreed to by the two commanding consuls, as the army was facing starvation. Livy describes in detail the humiliation of the Romans, which serves to underline the wisdom of Herennius's advice. Livy contradicts himself as to whether Rome honored or quickly repudiated the Caudine Peace. Livy claims the Roman Senate rejected the terms but, elsewhere, claims Rome honored the Caudine Peace until hostilities broke out afresh in 316.E. T.

In Australian usage, it can mean a tramp or homeless man. However, many other definitions center around money. People involved in political fundraising, soliciting donations, or otherwise involved in the financial side of a political campaign may be referred to as a bagman. This usage has led to an expansion of meaning to include those who solicit bribes for public officials. In organized crime, a bagman may be involved in protection rackets or the numbers game, collecting or distributing the money involved. When acting as an intermediary in such activities, a bagman may also be called a delivery boy or running man, and may receive a fraction of the money collected. Journalist Jack Shafer defines \\"bag man\\" as a slang term \\"for criminals who perform deliveries and run errands for other criminals.\\" In criminal operations involving disbursements of cash as illegal payments for some service, a bagman delivers the money, often cash, to the recipient, such as Fred LaRue in the Watergate affair.

The official handover was expected to be completed in 2016, but in June 2016 the group announced that they had not been successful in their Stage 2 Community Asset Transfer. The group retained the licence to occupy until 28 October 2016, when the building was returned to Aberdeenshire Council. Turriff and District Heritage Society were granted a Community Asset Transfer of the building and renamed it Turriff Heritage Centre. Turriff has a senior football club called Turriff United F.C. who now play in the Highland League, having been voted into membership on 26 February 2009. Turriff United Ladies play in the SWFL Second Division and there is also an amateur club, Turriff Thistle, which plays in the AAFA Division Two. The \\"Turriff Show\\", which is widely accepted as Scotland's largest two-day agricultural show, is held annually on the first Sunday and Monday of August; the Monday is a local holiday in the town. The show marked its 150th anniversary in 2014 with a visit from Queen Elizabeth II. The town has its own weekly newspaper, the Turriff Advertiser, established in 1933 and commonly nicknamed The Squeak. History Statue commemorating the Turra Coo The Knights Templar appear to have had a base in the area, and a nearby site is still known as \\"Temple Brae\\". Turriff was notable as the scene of the very first engagements of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms (1639‚Äì51). Early in 1639, the Marquis of Huntly assembled his forces here, and thereafter went to Kintore in lower Aberdeenshire, eventually marching from there to Aberdeen itself. The Marquis ‚Äî being informed shortly after his arrival in Aberdeen that a meeting of Covenanters was to be held in Turriff on the fourteenth of February ‚Äî resolved to disperse them, by occupying the town with 2000 men. The incident was known as the \\"Raid of Turriff\\" and was followed a few days later by a minor engagement known as the \\"Trot of Turriff\\".Trevor Royle (2005) Civil War: The Wars of the Three Kingdoms. London, Abacus: 89-91 More recently, the 1913 Turra Coo incident in the parish was the result of a local refusal to pay National Insurance when this was introduced by Lloyd George's government. Sheriff's officers seized a cow from a local farmer who refused to pay National Insurance contributions for his workers. The officers had difficulty selling the cow, as locals were sympathetic toward the farmer. Eventually they brought in an outside auctioneer, but the auction was disrupted by protesters and the cow escaped. A statue of the \\"coo\\" was erected in 2010 in the town centre at the junction of High Street and Main Street and has become a popular emblem for the town. Historically, Turriff was an important centre for agricultural trade, with its mart being mentioned in the mid-19th century Second Statistical Account of Scotland as one of the largest in the country. The mart finally ceased operation in December 1989, having been eclipsed by the newer Thainstone Mart at Inverurie. At one time the town was served by Turriff station on Banff, Macduff and Turriff Junction Railway.

Seal impression of the Akkadian Empire period. Etana (Cuneiform:íÇäíã´íàæ, E.TA.NA) was the thirteenth king of the first dynasty of Kish during the 29th century BC. According to the Sumerian king list, he reigned after the deluge. He is listed as the successor of Arwium, the son of Mashda, as king of Kish. The list also calls Etana \\"the shepherd, who ascended to heaven and consolidated all the foreign countries\\", and states that he ruled 1,560 years (some copies read 635) before being succeeded by his son Balih, said to have ruled 400 years. Myth of Etana A Babylonian legend says that Etana was desperate to have a child, until one day he helped save an eagle from starving, who then took him up into the sky to find the plant of birth. This led to the birth of his son, Balih. In the detailed form of the legend, there is a tree with the eagle's nest at the top, and a serpent at the base. Both the serpent and eagle have promised Utu (the sun god) to behave well toward one another, and they share food with their children. But one day, the eagle eats the serpent's children. The serpent comes back and cries. Utu tells the serpent to hide inside the stomach of a dead bull. The eagle goes down to eat the bull. The serpent captures the eagle, and throws him into a pit to die of hunger and thirst. Utu sends a man, Etana, to help the eagle. Etana saves the eagle, but he also asks the bird to find the plant of birth, in order to become father of a son. The eagle takes Etana up to the heaven of the god Anu, but Etana becomes afraid in the air and he goes back to the ground. He makes another attempt, and finds the plant of birth, enabling him to have Balih. So far versions in three languages have been found. The Old Babylonian version comes from Susa and Tell Harmal, the Middle Assyrian version comes from Assur, and the Standard version is from Nineveh.Dalley 189. Analysis Folklorist scholarship recognizes that the tale of Etana helping an eagle fits into the Aarne-Thompson-Uther tale type ATU 537, \\"The Eagle as helper: hero carried on the wings of a helpful eagle\\".Annus, Amar & Sarv, Mari. \\"The Ball Game Motif in the Gilgamesh Tradition and International Folklore\\".

Arriving in New York he changed his German first name Wilhelm to William, Eppelsheimer designed the Clay Street Hill Railroad in San Francisco. This was the first practical cable car line in the world and the first line in what was to become the San Francisco cable car system, although that line is more often attributed to its promoter, Andrew Smith Hallidie. He later designed the Eppelsheimer bottom grip for the Geary Street, Park & Ocean Railway, another San Francisco line, and this is still used by that city's surviving cable cars. Eppelsheimer went on to design the Chicago City Railway, at one time the world's largest and most profitable cable car system, and London's Highgate Hill Cable Tramway, Europe's first cable tramway.

Its ratios differ in comparison to the base W55 in the 1st and 2nd gears only; this is to allow a slightly heavier vehicle (truck) to get up to speed slightly quicker than if geared like a car. This was most likely accomplished by taking the W55 base gears and changing the 1st and 2nd gear sets, as the rest of the transmission remains unchanged. Marlin Czajkowski, owner and CEO of Toyota-specific California-based rock crawling company Marlin Crawler, Inc., invented and popularized an A-through-E nomenclature system for 1985‚Äì1995 USA-market W56 transmissions. These include the W56-A (1985), W56-B (1986‚Äì88), W56-C (1989‚Äì91), W56-D (1992), and W56-E (1993‚Äì95) variants of 4WD Toyota Hilux Pickup and 4Runner W56 transmissions. This system is used to distinguish between the five major design changes Marlin has identified throughout this year span.

The ratio shift was accomplished by taking the W55 base ratios and changing the input shaft to intermediate shaft ratio by 7.9%, thus shifting 1, 2, 3 ratios higher by that amount (4th is direct 1:1). Unlike in the W58 the 5th/overdrive gear set was changed to create a smaller rpm drop between 4th & 5th gears so as to remain close to the overdrive ratio seen in the other boxes. The rest of the transmission remains unchanged. Ratios: * First Gear: 3.285:1 * Second Gear: 1.894:1 * Third Gear: 1.275:1 * Fourth Gear: 1.00:1 * Fifth Gear: 0.861:1 * Reverse: -3.768:1 Applications (calendar years): * 1983‚Äì1986 Toyota Supra MK 2 in certain non-US markets. * 1986 Toyota Crown * 1986 Toyota Cressida * 1982‚Äì1985 Toyota Celica (21R) W58 It differs from the W57 in its fifth- gear ratio. This transmission is popular as a replacement for weak stock transmissions in other vehicles. It came in two varieties: the original found in the 1982‚Äì1989 non-turbo Supras, Celicas and Cressidas of the early 1980s; and the later version found in Mk3, Mk 4 Supras and Lexus SC 300s. Toyota lists a change from an alloy sandwich plate to a steel sandwich plate around 1989. The steel sandwich plate has some minor internal differences, and it is believed to be slightly stronger (some wider bearings, some wider gears, slightly different gear selection mechanism, etc.). In theory the all-alloy version of the W58 should be exactly the same strength as any other all-alloy W-Series transmission. The steel plate version is considered much harder to find and worth approximately three to five times as much as an all alloy version. The ratios and bolt patterns remain the same regardless of the sandwich plate used. The W58 & W57 share the highest gearing and closest ratios (1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th (direct)) of the stock W-Series transmissions. The ratio shift was accomplished by taking the W55 base ratios and changing the input shaft to intermediate shaft ratio by 7.9%, thus shifting 1, 2, 3 ratios higher by that amount. This also shifted the overdrive 5th gear higher by the same amount creating a wider and taller overdrive ratio. The W58 is sometimes designated as a \\"close-ratio transmission\\"; however, in its stock form it does not meet all the criteria for a close-ratio box. Toyota engineers have shown favor to the W58 over the rest of the 'W' series by including it in so many models and even building a stronger version for higher powered applications.

This model appears to have a combination of ratios used in older models of the W-series. *1st and 2nd are low ratios like in the W56 for use to get a heavy vehicle moving. *3rd ratio is the same as in the W57/W58 for a lower rpm drop between 3rd & 4th useful in high-speed acceleration. *4th is direct 1:1 as per design in these boxes. *5th seems to be the base W55 overdrive ratio.

Its name was changed to avoid confusion with Fleming's novel. It was released in 1979. Plot British Secret Service agent James Bond, codename 007, must prevent Sir Hugo Drax's plan to murder the entire human race and then restart humanity from outer space. Background The screenplay of Moonraker differed so much from Ian Fleming's novel that Eon Productions authorised the film's screenwriter, Christopher Wood to write a novelization based upon the film, as he had done for The Spy Who Loved Me. As with the first novelization, Wood had no input from, or communication with Glidrose Publications. Instead he worked directly with Jonathan Cape publisher Tom Maschler. Unlike Wood's first novelization, which showed a significant difference from the actual film, in James Bond and Moonraker, Wood writes a virtually direct novelization of the screenplay. The only noticeable differences between the novelization and the screenplay for Moonraker is that there is no mention of Dolly, Jaws' girlfriend, and his characterisation stays true to Wood's description as being a mute. In addition, at the conclusion of the Venetian canal chase sequence, Bond's gondola does not sprout a flotation device and ascend to St. Mark's square as it does in the film. Reception Wood's second novelization was barely reviewed. Syndicated columnist Bob Greene was scathing. He said the novelization was \\"dreary and schlocky and juvenile; it lacks all of the wonderful tension and personality of the original Fleming book. James Bond would be embarrassed to be in it. [...] In the meantime, shed a tear for Ian Fleming and James Bond. And don't, under any circumstances, buy the \\"Moonraker\\" you see in the stores today. Hold out for the real thing. If you can't find it in the attic, come over and I'll lend you mine.\\" The Los Angeles Times critic claimed that Ian Fleming \\"would have cringed at the writing to be found in this book.\\" Despite this, Wood's novel became a bestseller, remaining on The Times bestseller list for some time. After the release of the novel, Eon Productions chose not to commission novelizations of the next few Bond films; not until Licence to Kill ten years later in 1989.

Since the screenplay for the film had nothing to do with Fleming's original novel, Eon Productions, for the first time, authorised that a novelization be written based upon the script. According to Ian Fleming's literary agent Peter Janson-Smith, \\"We had no hand in [the Christopher Wood novelizations] other than we told the film people that we were going to exert our legal right to handle the rights in the books. They chose Christopher Wood because he was one of the screenwriters at the time, and they decided what he would be paid. We got our instructions on that, but from then on, these books- of-the-films became like any other Bond novel‚Äîwe controlled the publication rights.\\" This would also be the first regular Bond novel published since Colonel Sun nearly a decade earlier. Christopher Wood, himself a novelist, and who co-authored the screenplay with Richard Maibaum, was commissioned to write the book, which was given the title James Bond, The Spy Who Loved Me. Wood would also novelize the screenplay for the next Bond film, Moonraker in 1979. Differences between novelization and screenplay The novelization and the screenplay, although both written by Wood, are somewhat different. In the novelization SMERSH has been reactivated some time before the start of the novel, and is still after James Bond. Their part in the novelization begins during the \\"pre-title credits\\" sequence, in which Bond is escaping from a cabin on the top of Aiguille du Mort, a mountain near the town of Chamonix. After the mysterious death of Fekkish, SMERSH appears yet again, this time capturing and torturing Bond for the whereabouts of the microfilm that retains plans for a submarine tracking system (Bond escapes after killing two of the interrogators). The revival of SMERSH goes against the latter half of Fleming's Bond novels, in which SMERSH is mentioned to have been put out of operation; however, it is explained within the novel as being Colonel-General Nikitin's doing. Members of SMERSH from the novelization include the Bond girl Anya Amasova and her lover Sergei Borzov, as well as Colonel-General Nikitin, a character from Fleming's novel From Russia, with Love who has since become head of the KGB. Other differences include the villain, Karl Stromberg, instead being named as Sigmund Stromberg. The change of Stromberg's given name, as well as the existence of SMERSH, may be in some way due to the controversy over Thunderball, in which Kevin McClory was made aware of certain plot points of the film The Spy Who Loved Me. At one point the villain of the film was to be Ernst Stavro Blofeld and his organisation SPECTRE; however, this was changed to avoid a possible lawsuit over the rights to this character, which originated from the novel Thunderball.

For the week of 7 August 1977, the novelization was at number 6 on the London Times paperback bestsellers list. Critical reception of the novel were mixed, though most praised Wood's skill as a writer. Marghanita Laski, writing in The Listener, called Wood \\"an apparently promising thriller writer struggling to emerge from obligatory bits of set-piece nastiness.\\" Former Bond author Kingsley Amis wrote in The New Statesman that, despite several reservations, \\"Mr Wood has bravely tackled his formidable task, that of turning a typical late Bond film, which must be basically facetious, into a novel after Ian Fleming, which must be basically serious. ... the descriptions are adequate and the action writing excellent.\\" T. J. Binyon, writing in The Times Literary Supplement said, \\"Christopher Wood's style is lusher than Ian Fleming's, and teeters throughout on the brink of parody.\\" Maurice Richardson in The Observer called \\"The latest licensed ersatz Bond\\" a \\"[s]uitable silly season read.\\" Australian novelist Eileen Alderton, writing for the Australian Women's Weekly called it \\"a gutsy, punchy novel\\" that has \\"as much action as anyone could take.\\" Available online. In their guide The Bond Files, Andy Lane and Paul Simpson say Wood's novel \\"counts as a decent Bond novel in its own right, and is certainly more stylish than many of the later volumes.\\" That said, fan reaction to the novelization has been largely positive, with many fans claiming it to be one of the better James Bond continuation novels. 10 August 2007 See also * Outline of James Bond References 1977 British novels James Bond books Novels based on films The Spy Who Loved Me (film) Cold War spy novels Jonathan Cape books ","title":"James Bond, The Spy Who Loved Me"},{"id":"1368665","text":"Bernhard Sch√∂lkopf (born February 20, 1968) is a director at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in T√ºbingen, Germany, where he heads the Department of Empirical Inference.

De Lijn was founded in 1991 after the public transportation companies of Antwerp and Ghent fused with the Flemish part of the NMVB (Nationale Maatschappij van Buurtspoorwegen, or the \\"National Company of Neighborhood Railways\\"). Socialist politician Steve Stevaert of Hasselt implemented a policy allowing registered residents in Flanders aged 65+ to ride anywhere in Flanders free. Other incentives exist for people under age 25. De Lijn is being viewed as an integral part to reduce heavily congested traffic, together with the NMBS (Belgium's national rail operator). In 2016, it transported more than 518.8 million passengers in an area with a population of approximately 6.5 million. De Lijn operates: * Antwerp Tramway, with both street running and underground light rail (Antwerp Pre-metro). * Ghent Tramway, mostly street running with some reserved track. * Belgian coast tram, interurban line along the whole Belgian coast, between De Panne and Knokke. * All urban, suburban and intercity buses in Flanders. Because of the dense rail network, intercity buses serve as local transport between big cities and smaller communities. Time to travel from one city to another by bus is most often longer than for the same journey on the train because bus lines are less straight, as they pass through many small towns that are not served by railway. The buses are more city-style (no coach buses are used). In the Limburg province with few railways buses are the main mode of intercity travel. There are also express intercity buses there. The fares are the same on all modes. De Lijn issues a smartcard called the Lijnkaart and a chain of shops called Lijnwinkel. De Lijn also supports the Flemish Tram and Bus Museum, located in Antwerp and connected to the tracks of the Antwerp Tramway.

He is most associated with the 1970s martial-arts and espionage series, Marvel's Master of Kung Fu. Biography =Early life and career= Paul Gulacy was raised in Youngstown, Ohio, and as a teen was inspired by art of Jim Steranko on Marvel Comics' Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.Gulacy in He went on to study at the Art Institute of Pittsburgh. Fellow Youngstown resident Val Mayerik, a Marvel artist, introduced him to another local Marvel artist, Dan Adkins of East Liverpool, Ohio, for whom Gulacy would work as an assistant, and who suggested Gulacy prepare a six-page sample for Marvel. \\"He sent it to an editor named Roy Thomas\\", Gulacy recalled, \\"and two weeks later I got the phone call telling me I was hired.\\" Gulacy's initial work as a Marvel freelancer was penciling the 15-page story \\"Morbius, the Living Vampire\\" in Adventure into Fear #20 (cover- dated Feb. 1974), written by Mike Friedrich and inked by Jack Abel. Following this came an inking assignment, over penciler Bob Brown on the superhero comic Daredevil #108 (March 1974). At some unspecified point during this time, Gulacy did a small amount of artwork for the pornographic magazine Hustler, explaining that comics artist Jim Steranko, whom he had met through Adkins, had turned down what Gulacy called \\"a couple of jobs\\" and suggested Gulacy instead. \\"I did them. They offered me more and a lot of money, but I turned them down. ... I consider it a skeleton in my closet.\\" In 1974, Gulacy began work on the character with which he became most associated, the philosophical martial artist and secret agent Shang-Chi, in the comic Master of Kung Fu (cover-billed as The Hands of Shang-Chi: Master of Kung Fu) #18 (June 1974), inked by Al Milgrom. That initial story and one the next issue were written by Steve Englehart, but issue #20 (Sept. 1974), co-written by Gerry Conway and Doug Moench, and the same month's Giant-Size Master of Kung Fu #1, written by Moench, marked the beginning of a Moench‚ÄìGulacy collaboration on the increasingly complex, cinematic feature about the son of longtime pulp fiction supervillain Fu Manchu, who teams with British intelligence to bring down his father's labyrinthine plans for global domination. With some exceptions, the writer‚Äìpenciler team would continue through a serialized arc to issue #50 (March 1977), culminating with the apparent death of Fu Manchu. Comics historian Les Daniels observed that, \\"Ingenious writing by Doug Moench and energetic art by Paul Gulacy brought Master of Kung Fu new life.\\" In 2010, Comics Bulletin ranked Moench and Gulacy's work on Master of Kung-Fu sixth on its list of the \\"Top 10 1970s Marvels\\". In the later 1970s, Gulacy took on occasional other assignments, including the covers of the science fiction film adaptation Logan's Run #6 (June 1977) and of the Western The Rawhide Kid #147 (Sept. 1978), both for Marvel; and a 10-page preview of the graphic novel Sabre: Slow Fade of an Endangered Species, with writer Don McGregor, in the comics-magazine Heavy Metal vol. 2, #2 (June 1978; mislabeled \\"vol. 3, #2\\" in indicia).Metal Magazine #v3#02 at the Grand Comics Database =Graphic-novel pioneer= Sabre (1978), one of the first graphic novels. Cover art by Gulacy. With writer Don McGregor, Gulacy created one of the first American modern graphic novels, Eclipse Books' Sabre: Slow Fade of an Endangered Species. Published in August 1978‚Äîtwo months before Will Eisner's more famous graphic short story collection A Contract with God‚Äîit was the first graphic novel to be sold in the new \\"direct market\\" of comic-book stores. Described on the credits page as a \\"comic novel\\" (the term \\"graphic novel\\" not being in common usage at the time), the trade paperback was priced at a then-considerable $6.00. It helped prove the new format's viability by going into a February 1979 second printing. Eclipse would publish a 10th-anniversary edition (hardcover ; trade paperback ) with a new Gulacy cover. A 20th-anniversary edition was published by Image Comics in 1998, and a 30th anniversary edition by Desperado Publishing in 2009. =1980s= In 1979 and 1980, Gulacy drew several horror/science fiction/fantasy stories for Warren Publishing's black- and-white comics magazines Eerie, Vampirella, and Warren Presents; some were reprinted in Eclipse Comics Nightmares #1‚Äì2 in 1985. Gulacy also drew the cover and the six-page story \\"Libido\\", written by his Master of Kung Fu colleague Doug Moench, in the comics magazine Epic Illustrated #3 (Fall 1980). Along with the covers for independent publisher Capital Comics' superhero title Nexus #1‚Äì2 (1981‚Äì1982), Gulacy drew covers and an occasional story for such anthology series as Marvel's Marvel Preview and Bizarre Adventures and Eclipse Comics' Eclipse Magazine. In 1983, he drew several covers for independent AC Comics' Black Diamond, Americomics, Starmasters, and Femforce Special before reteaming with Moench on the four-issue, creator-owned Epic Comics miniseries Six from Sirius (July‚ÄìOctober 1984) and its four-issue sequel, Six from Sirius II (December 1985‚ÄìMarch 1986). Through the remainder of the decade, he drew primarily for Eclipse (the company's revival of the 1940s series Airboy and a new spin-off, Valkyrie) and Dark Horse Comics. Gulacy also began working for DC Comics with Batman #393‚Äì394 (March‚ÄìApril 1986), and the six-issue miniseries Slash Maraud (November 1987‚ÄìApril 1988), co-created with Moench. The two also collaborated on a series of eight-page chapters starring the superhero Coldblood which ran in the biweekly omnibus Marvel Comics Presents #26‚Äì35 (August‚ÄìNovember 1989). =Later career= During the 1990s, Gulacy worked primarily on Batman and such science-fiction movie properties as Terminator, Predator, and Star Wars, and co-created the Valiant Comics crime series Grackle. Among the many titles Gulacy has drawn are the DC Comics Batman, Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight (\\"Batman: Prey\\"), Batman: Outlaws, Year One: Batman/Ra's al Ghul,Manning \\"2000s\\" in Dougall, p. 281: \\"Writer Devin Grayson and artist Paul Gulacy told a tale of Batman versus the threat of Ra's al Ghul.\\" Catwoman, Green Lantern: Dragon Lord and JSA: Classified; Acclaim Comics' Eternal Warrior and Turok, Dinosaur Hunter; Dark Horse Comics' Star Wars: Crimson Empire; and Penthouse Comix's Omni Comix. In 2002, he combined his interest in science fiction and spy stories in DC Comics' S.C.I. Spy, and that same year returned to his signature character with his and Doug Moench's six-issue Marvel miniseries Shang-Chi: Master of Kung Fu (November 2002 ‚Äì April 2003). Other Marvel work includes collaborations with writer Marc Guggenheim on the four-issue miniseries Squadron Supreme: Hyperion vs. Nighthawk (March‚ÄìJune 2007) and with writer Cary Bates on True Believers. Personal life As of 1989, Gulacy lived in Portland, Oregon, with his wife Valerie and their infant daughter Paige. In December 2008, he married wife Nanci. As of 2014 they remained married.

It was originally spoken in northeastern Iraq, in the region of Arbil. Most speakers now live in Israel. Lishanid Noshan means \\"the language of our people\\". Speakers often also call it Lishana Didan, which means 'our language'. However, as similar names are used by most of the dialects of Jewish Neo-Aramaic, scholarly sources tend to call it \\"Arbil Jewish Neo-Aramaic\\". Other popular names for the language are Hula'ula, Galigalu, 'mine-yours' (noting the difference in grammar from other dialects), Sureth and Kurdit.  Origins  Various Neo-Aramaic dialects were spoken across a wide area from Lake Urmia to Lake Van (in Turkey), down to the plain of Nineveh (in Iraq) and back across to Sanandaj (in Iran again). Lishanid Noshan is quite central to this area (although normally termed a southwestern dialect). It is somewhat intelligible with the Jewish Neo-Aramaic languages of Hulaula (spoken to the east, in Iranian Kurdistan) and Lishan Didan (spoken to the north east, in Iranian Azerbaijan). It is also intelligible with Assyrian Neo-Aramaic spoken in the region. However, it is quite unintelligible from Lishana Deni, the dialect that originally came from northwestern Iraq (Assyria). It is only since the 1980s that studies have shown the distinctiveness that separates Lishanid Noshan from Hulaula; before this time they were simply considered to be dialect clusters of the same essential language. Phonology Lishanid Noshan has 40 phonemes. 34 of them are consonants, and 6 of them are vowels. Laryngeals and pharyngeals originally found in Lishanid Noshan have not been preserved. In Aramaic, * ï, a voiced pharyngeal fricative is prominent in words. However, it has weakened in Lishanid Noshan to / î/ or zero. Regarding interdental fricatives, there has been a shift seen with *t and *d. *h, the original unvoiced pharyngeal fricative, has fused with the velar fricative /x/ in Northeastern Neo-Aramaic dialects. This is not the case for Lishanid Noshan. *h can still be seen in some words such as dbh, which means \\"to slaughter.\\" Word stress often occurs on the final syllable of stems of nominals and verbs. Grammar =Word Order= Subjects in Lishand Noshan often come before the verb when they are full nominals. The referent of subject nominals in this canonical order can be identified from the prior discourse or through assumed shared information between the speakers. Sometimes, it can also be used when the referent of the subject nominal has not been entered into the discourse yet and is not identifiable by the hearer. : îiyy√° kƒÅbr√° q√¨mle. :This man got up. Nominals that function as direct objects in verb clauses are normally positioned before the verb. =Articles= Definite articles In Lishanid Noshan, -ake is the definite article. According to Khan, this affix is another sign of how Kurdish dialects have influenced this language; the Kurdish dialects have -aka for the direct case and -akay in the oblique case. When -ake is added to a noun, the singular and plural endings -a and -e are taken off. Indefinite articles Definiteness is expressed if the speaker assumes the hearer has background knowledge on the nominal being inserted into the conversation. =Negation= Regarding negative copular clauses, Lishanid Noshan differentiates constructions that use the negative present versus the negative past. Negative present copula Negative present copula is often inserted before or after the predicate. This particular copula usually contains the main stress of the intonation group. This phenomenon can happen in the middle of a predicate phrase. : îiyy√° mewƒÅnid did√¨ lew√©?' :Is he not my guest? Negative past copula This particular type of copular comes before the predicate in Lishanid Noshan very often. The main stress is inserted either on the predicate phrase or on la, the negator in Lishanid Noshan.

The yes-no type of interrogatives has an intonation pattern that rises in pitch where the main stress is; there is no drop in pitch in any of the syllables that come after the part where the main stress is. :gb√°t xa-ƒç√†y? :Do you want a tea? :lƒÅ la-ƒ°z√®lox mall√°? :Have you not seen the mullah? =Prepositional case= Certain verbs in Lishanid Noshan mark their complement with the preposition b-. :bad√©niwa bi-xlul√°. :They began the wedding. :tq√®le-bbeu. :He pleaded with him. Modern use There are two major dialect clusters of Lishanid Noshan. The western cluster of dialects was centred on Arbil. Most of the Jews of Arbil itself spoke Arabic as their first language, and their Syriac-Aramaic was heavily influenced by Mesopotamian Arabic. Dastit, the language of the plain, is the Aramaic dialect of the villages of the Plain of Arbil. Lishanid Noshan was also spoken about 50 km north of Arbil, in the village of Dobe, with a dialect related to, but distinct from Arbili. The eastern cluster of dialects was focused on the town of Koy Sanjaq in the mountains of northeastern Iraq (but not related to the Christian language of Koy Sanjaq Surat), with a slightly different subcluster further north, around the village of Ruwandiz. The dialects of the two clusters are intelligible to one another, and most of the differences are due to receiving loanwords from different languages: Arabic and Kurdish. The verbal system of Lishanid Noshan is quite distinctive. Variations of it mark the boundaries of dialect clusters within the language. The Arbil dialect expresses the progressive aspect by prefixing the particle la- to the verb form (for example, laqatil, 'he is killing', and laqtille, 'he was killing', against qatil, 'he kills', and qtille, 'he killed'). The Dobe dialect does a similar thing, but uses the prefix na-. The eastern cluster dialects use non-finite forms of the verb with the copula to express the progressive aspect. The upheavals in their traditional region after the First World War and the founding of the State of Israel led most of the Jews of Kurdistan to settle in the new Jewish homeland. However, uprooted from their homes, and thrown together with so many different language groups in the fledgling nation, Lishanid Noshan began to be replaced in the speech of younger generations by Modern Hebrew. Fewer than 3,000 people are known to speak Lishanid Noshan, and most of them are over 40 years old. The language faces extinction in the next few decades. Lishanid Noshan is written in the Hebrew alphabet. Spelling tends to be highly phonetic, and elided letters are not written.

He served also as an author and poet as well as a staunch advocate of the nation's culture. He served in various parishes as a simple priest prior to his becoming a bishop in which his patriotic activism increased to a higher degree since he advocated writing and the need for education. He penned textbooks for schools including those that he himself opened and he was a vocal supporter of ecumenism and led efforts to achieve greater dialogue with other faiths with an emphasis on the Eastern Orthodox Church. His beatification had its origins in the 1930s, when petitions were lodged for a formal cause to commence; this all culminated on 19 September 1999, when Pope John Paul II presided over the late bishop's beatification in Maribor. Life Anton Martin Slom≈°ek was born as the eighth child to the peasants Marko Slom≈°ek and Marija n√©e Zorko on 26 November 1800 in Styria in Slovenia. The priest Bla≈æ Slom≈°ek (1708‚Äì1740) was his paternal uncle and Janez Slom≈°ek (1831‚Äì1909) was his paternal cousin Gregorius' son. He underwent his theological and philosophical studies since 1821 (a classmate was the poet France Pre≈°eren) in order to enter the priesthood and he was later ordained as such on 8 September 1824 in Klagenfurt. He celebrated his first Mass on 26 September at Olimje. He first served as a parish chaplain at Bizeljsko and then at Nova Cerkev. From 1829 until 1838 he served as the spiritual director of seminarians at Klagenfurt. In 1838 he became the parish priest at Saldenhofen an der Drau. In 1844 he relocated to Sankt Andr√§ and headed the school in Lavant while also serving as the cathedral canon there. He became the parish priest in Celje in March 1846 just prior to his episcopal appointment. In one of his final appointments, Pope Gregory XVI, made Slom≈°ek the new Bishop of Lavant and he received his episcopal consecration a couple of months later in Salzburg, although he did not celebrate his formal installation until September 1859, when he first moved to his new see. He strove for religious education in schools and for education in Slovene; he began writing numerous books on the matter. Slom≈°ek was considered to be an excellent preacher as well as a tireless and modest cleric. The bishop oversaw the construction of new schools and he himself issued textbooks for students and edited others while also publishing his own sermons and episcopal statements. He also wrote songs and some of which (like the toast \\"En hribƒçek bom kupil\\") achieved great social standing and some are still sung at present. Together with Andrej Einspieler and Anton Jane≈æiƒç he was the co-founder of the Hermagoras Association which is the oldest Slovene publishing house. He founded movements for greater ecumenism efforts . Pope Pius IX entrusted him with the mission to renew the religious life in Benedictine monasteries and so he made a series of apostolic visits to see these places. He also invited the Vincentians to settle in his diocese and in 1846 began the newspaper \\"Drobtinice\\" for his diocese. He also founded the Brotherhood of Saints Cyril and Methodius in 1851 for greater ecumenism with the Eastern Orthodox Church. Slom≈°ek also supported those in the missions and prompted the Spiritual Exercises. Slom≈°ek died on 24 September 1862 after having suffered a series of stomach ailments for some time. His remains are interred in the Maribor Cathedral. Beatification Tomb in the Maribor Cathedral Bust The beatification process opened in Maribor in an informative process that investigated his life and his virtues which later received validation on 2 December 1994 from the Congregation for the Causes of Saints; the postulation sent the Positio in 1995 to the C.C.S. for assessment. Historians first approved the cause on 9 January 1996 as did theologians on 2 April 1996 and the C.C.S. on 7 May 1996. His life of heroic virtue was confirmed on 13 May 1996 and this allowed for Pope John Paul II to title him as Venerable. The miracle for his beatification was investigated and received C.C.S. validation on 20 June 1996 prior to a medical panel approving it on 4 February 1997; theologians did so also on 20 June 1997 as did the C.C.S. on 1 July 1998. John Paul II approved this miracle on 3 July 1998 and beatified Slom≈°ek in Maribor while in Slovenia on 19 September 1999.

Fournier was later to become Pope Benedict XII. Interrogation Fournier interrogated hundreds of individuals and had transcripts recorded of each interrogation. Fournier also demanded a great deal of detail from those appearing before him. Most of those he interviewed were local peasants and the Fournier register is thus one of the most detailed records of life among medieval peasants. The records have thus frequently been the focus of scholars, most notably Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie whose pioneering work of microhistory Montaillou is largely based on the material in the register. Prior to Bishop Fournier the local authorities had done little to pursue local heretics, and the region was one of the last areas of France to be home to a significant number of Cathars. Fournier began a rigorous hunt for heretics upon his appointment and set up the new court at Pamiers. He personally supervised almost all of his operations. Fournier only very rarely turned to torture to extract information, and when he did so it was generally under explicit orders from his superiors. The great bulk of his interrogations relied on Fournier's verbal skill at drawing out answers. Ladurie reports the court as conducting 578 interrogations in the 370 days it was in operation. The severest sentence was to be burnt at the stake, but this was rare, with this inquisition only sentencing five heretics to this fate. More common was to be imprisoned for a time or to be forced to wear a yellow cross on one's back. Other punishments included forced pilgrimages and confiscation of property. The record was assembled in three stages: # During the inquisition itself a scribe would make quick notes in short form to record the conversation. # These would then be expanded into full minutes, which were then presented to the accused for review and alterations in case of errors. # Finally a final version would be recorded. The process also involved translating the dialogue from the local Occitan to the Latin of the Church. Nonbelievers among the heretics Even though the main focus of Fournier's inquisition work was to find Cathars, he was occasionally confronted with skeptics and nonbelievers. In 1318, Fournier interrogated Aude from the village of Merviel. Aude had initially expressed doubts about the transubstantiation, and had subsequently also discussed her nonbelief in the existence of God with her husband and aunt. To her husband she said: \\"Sir, how is it possible that I cannot believe in our Lord?\\"McGowan, p. 89 And she asked her aunt: ‚ÄúAunt, what might I do to believe in God, and to believe that the body of Christ is really on the altar?‚ÄùMcGowan, p. 89 Another woman, Guillemette of Ornolac, was brought in for interrogation because she doubted the existence of the soul. She expressed the opinion that what is referred to as the ‚Äúsoul‚Äù is nothing more than blood and that death is final. When Fournier asked her if anyone had taught her these ideas, she answered: ‚ÄúNo, I thought it over and believed it myself.‚ÄùMcGowan, p. 89-90 Both women were sentenced to wear a double yellow cross on their backs for the rest of their lives.McGowan, p. 90 An even more outspoken villager who was called in for questioning by Fournier, was Raimond de l‚ÄôAire. Witnesses had heard him say that \\"God never made the world, that the world had always existed, that the resurrection was a myth, that the Eucharist was nothing more than bread and wine, that the rituals of the priests meant nothing, and that he gave to the poor not for his soul but so that others would see him as a good man.\\" McGowan, p. 90 A witness told Fournier that Raimond deserved to be put to death for saying that Christ was not created through divine intervention, but \\"just through screwing, like everybody else.\\".McGowan, p. 90 Fournier's records however do not mention whether or not Raimond was sentenced to die. Fournier becomes Pope After his time in Pamiers, Fournier was rapidly promoted through the ranks of the church eventually rising to Pope as Benedict XII in 1334. The register followed him and was placed in the Vatican Library where it remains to this day. Complete editions of it have been recently published in Latin and in French, but only portions have been translated into English.

The term maidan means \\"playing ground\\" in Marathi. The ground measures 23,000 m¬≤. The name \\"Cross\\" is derived for the old stone Cross (crucifix) built when the city was under Portuguese rule in the 16th century. The maidan is under the jurisdiction of the district collector. In 2009 it was announced that a 30-foot tall steel sculpture inspired by Mahatma Gandhis charkha would be installed at the maidan. In the same year, the government also announced that it would be laying a water tunnel from the Malabar Hill reservoir to Cross Maidan at the cost of Rs. 940 million. It is claimed that the South Mumbai locality will have adequate water supply once this water tunnel is completed. The Maidan Cricket Pitches at Cross Maidan The vast expanses of land of the Oval Maidan, Azad Maidan, Cooperage Ground and Cross Maidan until the early 20th century formed the area known as Esplanade. The road which divides Cross Maidan and Azad Maidan which is today called Mahatma Gandhi Road was formerly known as the Esplanade. The term Esplanade is almost obliterated from history books except for the Mumbai High Court which still goes by the term esplanade court. The part of MG Road abutting the Cross Maidan is popularly known as Fashion Street, with a range of vogue clothing at throwaway prices. The rest of the ground is used for cricket in the dry season and football (soccer) during the monsoons. Near the southern end, the Mahindra United Club, a national level club, has undertaken a lease of a small portion of the ground. In the past, traveling circuses have used the ground. The ground hosts eight cricket pitches. In 1986, Reliance Industries Limited held their AGM at the ground with 30,000 company shareholders in attendance. During the pre- independence era, the ground used to hold rallies and parades. Cutting across the centre of the ground is a shortcut that links the two railway stations of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus and Churchgate. The lane known as \\"Khau Galli\\" meaning Food Lane in Marathi, is traversed by thousands of people rushing to their work places. At times exhibitions and fairs are held in the maidan. Due to encroachment by Fashion Street hawkers and also mounds of garbage dumped in the southern end of the maidan, it has deteriorated to such an extent that a special committee has been set up to look after the ground, fence it off and clear the garbage and attain a heritage status. The Cross Crucifix The cross used to stand where the current Elphinstone School currently stands. Currently it stands at the northern end of the ground. The cross is attested to have miraculous powers and devotees come from all over Mumbai and Goa during the feast on 3 May. The cross is adulated by both Christians and non-Christians. Good Friday and Maundy Thursday services are held in an exclusive area around the cross. The cross is maintained by the local diocese. Bhika Behram Well At the southern end of the maidan stands a well built by Bhika Behram in 1725. Behram, a Parsi, was travelling through this region, when he built this well for travellers. The well has a perennial source of sweet water, which is remarkable as most of the water in the area is brackish owing to the proximity to the Arabian Sea. The site is a declared heritage structure and is held sacred by the Parsi community.

Aerial Ballet was Nilsson's second album for RCA Victor, and was titled after the highwire circus act of his grandparents. It consists almost entirely of songs written by him, including \\"One\\", which later became a Number Five hit for Three Dog Night. (The song's opening line, \\"One is the loneliest number\\", is a common phrase to this day.) The title of the album has been given by Joey Kramer as the inspiration for Aerosmith's name and wings motif. The most familiar track from Aerial Ballet is its one cover song, Fred Neil's \\"Everybody's Talkin. It was released as a single in North America in 1968, and reached the top forty in Canada‚Äîbut initially flopped in the US. However, the song was subsequently selected for use in the Oscar-winning film Midnight Cowboy and became one of Nilsson's biggest hits as a performer, hitting the US top ten in 1969. Another song, \\"Little Cowboy\\", later featured in The Courtship of Eddie's Father, was written by Nilsson's mother. The original opening number for Aerial Ballet was \\"Daddy's Song\\", but this track was removed (apparently without Nilsson's awareness) after the first copies were issued, because The Monkees had recorded a cover version to be featured in their film Head, and had paid $35,000 for exclusive rights to the song. The CD reissue restores \\"Daddy's Song\\" (with the Monkees' contract long expired) to its rightful place in the lineup. When Nilsson visited the Beatles in London during 1968, John Lennon played Nilsson \\"Revolution\\" and selections from the (then-upcoming) White Album, and Nilsson, in turn, played to Lennon (who had spent thirty-six hours listening to Nilsson's previous album, Pandemonium Shadow Show) a demo cut of this record. The album was reissued in 1980 on Pickwick (ACL-7075). It had a different cover featuring a biplane in a field, with the pilot standing in the foreground smoking a cigarette in a holder. It had a printed stamp in the upper right corner announcing \\"Grammy Award Winner, Best Contemporary Male Vocalist, Everybody's Talkin.

A Vietnam veteran; he races cars, holds a Bonneville Salt Flats land speed record, and is a private pilot. Early life Wilcox was born on 8 August 1947 in San Diego, the son of Marion G. and John C. Wilcox. He and his three siblings were raised in Rawlins, Wyoming, by their single mother. He graduated from Rawlins High School went to the University of Wyoming, then transferred to Los Angeles Pierce College. He eventually went to Cal State Northridge. He worked at different jobs including acting and rodeo cowboy. =Vietnam War= Wilcox enlisted in the Marine Corps in May 1967 and served in Vietnam during the Tet Offensive. While in Vietnam he studied French and took general classes at College of the Desert during his final year in the Marines at Twentynine Palms, California. He was honorably discharged with the rank of Staff Sergeant in 1973. Entertainment career =Early years= Wilcox made a guest appearance in 1971 in Room 222. In 1973, Wilcox appeared in The Streets of San Francisco episode \\"The Runaways\\" as older brother George. Also in 1973, he starred in Lassie as Dale, one of the boys who grew up there and was now working as a hired hand. Wilcox appeared in an episode of Cannon \\"Target In The Mirror\\" in 1973 in an uncredited role as a witness. He performed in the 1976 film The Last Hard Men, and other TV appearances including The Partridge Family, Hawaii Five-O, M*A*S*H, Fantasy Island, and Police Story, as well as commercials. He was the main (and only human for most of it) actor of a two- part show on The Wonderful World of Disney anthology show in 1978 playing a lone cowboy on a cattle drive and his adventures en route to market. He also played Emmett Dalton in the 1979 film The Last Ride of the Dalton Gang. =CHiPs= Wilcox and Erik Estrada on CHiPS in 1977 Wilcox was cast as Jon Baker, one of the lead characters on CHiPs; he was not in season six and was cast from 1977 to 1982. Wilcox performed many of his own stunts on the show. Unlike his co-star Erik Estrada (who played his partner \\"Ponch\\"), Wilcox never sustained any major injuries. By the 1979‚Äì80 season, he made $25,000 per episode (the same amount as Estrada) and it escalated thereafter. During his time on CHiPs, Wilcox appeared on the cover of TV Guide three times, along with Estrada. Rumors of friction between the two had occurred late in the 1978‚Äì79 season, but it calmed down after Estrada's injury at the beginning of the 1979‚Äì80 season as Wilcox came to his friend's rescue. Wilcox confirmed that some of the rumors of on-set feuding were true, but minor issues blown out of proportion. He added: \\"We're just two totally different people.\\" Wilcox is among the cast members who appeared at a reunion in Los Angeles to celebrate the series' 35th anniversary. Wilcox filmed the event and helped raise money for police officers and for kids at risk. Wilcox stated he called Estrada to invite him, as did Robert Pine, but Estrada did not return calls nor did he show up for the event. Estrada's manager said he was trying to establish a new and separate identity from CHiPs. =After chips= In 1982, Wilcox left CHiPs and formed his own production company, Wilcox Productions, which produced the award-winning TV series for HBO The Ray Bradbury Theater for five years. He developed, optioned, and sold to MGM The Yorkshire Ripper and sold to Columbia The Wolfman Jack Story. Later, Wilcox optioned Flipper and was the executive producer of that movie for Universal Pictures. He also continued acting and directing. Presently, Wilcox works with Saratoga Entertainment which is a production and digital distribution company. He also is a consultant to Enabledware, which is a rule-based digital distribution software in 57 languages with a focus on digital universities and security for sports stadiums. Wilcox was executive producer of the TV movie Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story. The story had a deeper resonance for Wilcox, whose older sister was fatally shot in front of her three children, her mother, and 17 witnesses. The accused murderer, her husband, was later acquitted in a celebrated trial in Wyoming and subsequently killed in a barroom brawl, according to Wilcox. He appeared in a 1985 made-for-TV movie sequel to The Dirty Dozen, called The Dirty Dozen: Next Mission. He played a convicted war prisoner Tommy Wells, recruited to help terminate a German general who is plotting to assassinate Hitler. Wilcox was reunited briefly on- screen with his former co-star Estrada in National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon 1, and then again in 1998, where he reprised his role of Jon Baker (now Captain Baker) in the Turner Network Television production of CHiPs '99. In 2008, Wilcox had a brief cameo in the music video for Rehab's song \\"Bartender Song (Sittin' at a Bar)\\". He played a California Highway Patrol sergeant, a reference to his role on CHiPs. He appeared in a cameo as himself dressed as Officer Jon Baker on the 2009 Christmas episode of 30 Rock. Wilcox also completed a cameo in the feature film Two Sillies. He made a brief appearance as mine owner Bob Freeman in the 2016 drama 94 Feet. Personal life Wilcox married his first wife, Judy Vagner, on March 29, 1969, while serving his last months of duty after returning from the Vietnam War. They had two children together, Derek and Heidi. His second marriage was to Dutch native Hannie Strasser, a one-time CHiPs assistant sound technician. The wedding took place on April 11, 1980. They honeymooned in New Zealand enjoying relative anonymity at that time. Their daughter, Wendy, was born in 1982 and they divorced immediately after. Wilcox raised Wendy. On March 22, 1986, Wilcox married Marlene Harmon, a member of the 1980 Olympic heptathlon team. They reside in the San Fernando Valley and have two sons, Chad and Ryan. He assisted in caring for his father-in-law Russ, a stroke patient, who has since died. Wilcox set up an NPO Hub website to benefit police officers killed in the line of duty and various philanthropic projects. In 2018 he put together two significant film and technology funds for his entertainment companies and his digital city vision. =2010 securities fraud= In November 2010, Wilcox pleaded guilty to criminal charges of conspiracy to commit securities fraud. The Justice Department alleged that Wilcox had paid a commission which was deemed illegal as a kickback as a result of an FBI sting operation. He proved that all of his shares were still in his control and none were sold, but due to the fact that he paid an illegal commission on a pension fund and was introduced by a party who with 40 others was involved in a pump and dump scheme, he was guilty as a conspirator. In pleading guilty, he stated before the court, \\"This was an aberration as I betrayed my core values with what I did.

The shape is inspired by a traditional European cake known as , but Bundt cakes are not generally associated with any single recipe. The style of mold in North America was popularized in the 1950s and 1960s, after cookware manufacturer Nordic Ware trademarked the name \\"Bundt\\" and began producing Bundt pans from cast aluminum. Publicity from Pillsbury saw the cakes gain widespread popularity. Etymology Babka (cake) in a Bundt shape The Bundt cake derives in part from a European brioche-like cake called . In the north of Germany is traditionally known as (), a name formed by joining the two words and (cake). Opinions differ as to the significance of the word . One possibility is that it means \\"bunch\\" or \\"bundle\\", and refers to the way the dough is bundled around the tubed center of the pan. In Dutch, the cake is called \\"tulband,\\" which is Dutch for 'turban.' The pronunciation of the second part of this word is very similar to that of 'bundt.' Another source suggests that it describes the banded appearance given to the cake by the fluted sides of the pan, similar to a tied sheaf or bundle of wheat. Some authors have suggested that instead refers to a group of people, and that is so called because of its suitability for parties and gatherings. Uses of the word bund outside of Europe to describe cakes can be found in Jewish-American cookbooks from around the start of the 20th century. The alternative spelling \\"bundte\\" also appears in a recipe as early as 1901. Design Bundt-style pans in silicone and metal Bundt cakes do not conform to any single recipe; instead, their characterizing feature is their shape. A Bundt pan generally has fluted or grooved sides, but its most defining design element is the central tube or \\"chimney\\" which leaves a cylindrical hole through the center of the cake. The design means that more of the mixture touches the surface of the pan than in a simple round pan, helping to provide faster and more even heat distribution during baking. The shape is similar to that of the earlier European Gugelhupf or . A differs from contemporary Bundt-style cakes in that it follows a particular yeast-based recipe, with fruit and nuts, and is often deeper in shape and more decorative. Also similar in shape is the Eastern European Babka, dating from early 18th century Poland. Today, there is no single recipe for \\"Bundt cake.\\" Recipes range from spicy pine-nut-and-chili cakes to ice cream and fruit concoctions. Nordic Ware and other vendors sell Bundt-style pans in a variety of novelty shapes. Since a toroidal cake is difficult to frost, Bundt cakes are typically either dusted with powdered sugar, drizzle-glazed, or served undecorated. Recipes specifically designed for Bundt pans often have a baked-in filling; Bundt pound cakes are also common. Since the name \\"Bundt\\" is a trademark, similar pans are often sold as \\"fluted tube pans\\" or given other similar descriptive titles. The trademark holder Nordic Ware produces Bundt pans only in aluminum, but similar fluted pans are available in other materials.:File:Napfkuchen-Form.jpg Rise to popularity Rainbow Bundt cake, partially sliced The people credited with popularizing the Bundt cake are American businessman H. David Dalquist and his brother Mark S. Dalquist , who co-founded cookware company Nordic Ware based in St. Louis Park, Minnesota. In the late 1940s, Rose Joshua and Fannie Schanfield, friends and members of the Minneapolis Jewish-American Hadassah Society approached Dalquist asking if he could produce a modern version of a traditional cast iron dish. Dalquist and company engineer Don Nygren designed a cast aluminum version which Nordic Ware then made a small production run of in 1950. In order to successfully trademark the pans, a \\"t\\" was added to the word \\"Bund\\". A number of the original Bundt pans now reside in the Smithsonian collection. Initially, the Bundt pan sold so poorly that Nordic Ware considered discontinuing it. The product received a boost when it was mentioned in the New Good Housekeeping Cookbook in 1963, but did not gain real popularity until 1966, when a Bundt cake called the \\"Tunnel of Fudge\\", baked by Ella Helfrich, took second place at the annual Pillsbury Bake-Off and won its baker $5,000. The resulting publicity resulted in more than 200,000 requests to Pillsbury for Bundt pans and soon led to the Bundt pan surpassing the tin Jell-O mold as the most-sold pan in the United States. In the 1970s Pillsbury licensed the name Bundt from Nordic Ware and for a while sold a range of Bundt cake mixes. To date more than 60 million Bundt pans have been sold by Nordic Ware across North America. November 15 has been named \\"National Bundt Day\\".

It is the largest and busiest hospital in Merseyside and Cheshire, and has the largest emergency department of its kind in the UK. A major redevelopment of the hospital began in 2013 and was scheduled for completion in 2017, but construction problems and the 2018 collapse of main contractor Carillion have pushed the estimated completion date back to 2022. Alongside Broadgreen Hospital and Liverpool University Dental Hospital, the hospital is managed by the Liverpool University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and is associated with the University of Liverpool, Liverpool John Moores University and the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. History =Current hospital= The current hospital, originally known simply as the Royal Liverpool Hospital, was designed to replace three other city centre acute hospitals that existed at the time ‚Äì the Liverpool Royal Infirmary on Pembroke Place, the David Lewis Northern Hospital on Great Howard Street, and the Royal Southern Hospital on Caryl Street. It had been agreed to amalgamate the separate facilities on a site in close proximity to the University of Liverpool for the purposes of medical education and research. The site on which the current hospital now stands (on Prescot Street) was identified as part of the post-war regeneration of Liverpool. However, building on the main hospital did not commence until 1963. The first phase of the hospital was designed by Holford Associates and built by Alfred McAlpine between 1963 and 1969.Gray, Tony (1987). The Road to Success: Alfred McAlpine 1935 - 1985. Rainbird Publishing. p. 107 The construction was plagued from the outset by problems of cost, time and quality, together with difficulties over fire certification due to changes in health and safety law whilst building work was ongoing. The second phase was completed and the hospital eventually opened in 1978. =Redevelopment= The new Royal Liverpool University Hospital (on the right), now due to open in 2022. In December 2013 the landmark ¬£429 million redevelopment of the Royal Liverpool University Hospital, procured under a Private Finance Initiative contract, reached financial close; its collaborative links with the University of Liverpool, and institutes on the Liverpool BioCampus, have given the city of Liverpool recognition as one of the leading UK centres for health research and innovation. The new Royal Liverpool University Hospital, which was designed by NBBJ and HKS and was being built by Carillion, was expected to be the largest all single-patient room hospital in the UK upon its originally scheduled completion of March 2017. In March 2017, the project was running more than a year late due to problems caused by asbestos, cracking concrete and bad weather, and further delays were announced in early January 2018. Less than a fortnight later, on 15 January 2018, Carillion went into liquidation, partly due to its problems with the hospital contract, and delaying the project still further, with the hospital unlikely to be finished in 2018. On 26 March 2018, it was reported that the project had been costing ¬£53.9m more than Carillion had officially reported. In September, the NHS Trust revealed that the cost of rectifying serious faults, including replacing non-compliant cladding installed by Carillion, was holding up plans to restart and finish the ¬£350m project; with the project further delayed, the Trust was considering invoking a break clause to terminate the PFI contract. On 24 September 2018, it was reported that the government would step in to terminate the PFI deal, taking the hospital into full public ownership, meaning a ¬£180m loss for private sector lenders Legal & General and the European Investment Bank. This was confirmed on 26 September 2018, with completion of the hospital in 2020 likely to cost an additional ¬£120m, due to unforeseen issues left behind by Carillion. Construction work was expected to resume in November 2018. On 25 October 2018 Laing O'Rourke was confirmed as the contractor to complete the project, but, a month later, with the contractor not prepared to take any risk, Mace was also appointed to help manage risks associated with the ¬£350m scheme. In April 2019, the project was reported to be facing further delays due to subcontractors' reluctance to work on the scheme, while further defects were detected in May 2019, with rectification also likely to delay completion and increase costs. On 17 December 2019, hospital CEO Steve Warburton confirmed the project had been further delayed until at least 2022 and that patients and staff would be at the existing hospital for the next three winters. In addition to ¬£285m already spent, Warburton said completion would cost ¬£300m, including costs to replace an aluminium composite cladding system, which, since the Grenfell Tower fire, was known to breach building regulations. In March 2020, the hospital NHS Trust revealed it was drawing up claims against Carillion's insurers and a Carillion subcontractor Heyrod Construction. In June 2020, the Portuguese manufacturer of the cladding was drafted in to remove it. A delayed National Audit Office report into the government's handling of the Royal Liverpool and Midland Metropolitan Hospitals was published in January 2020. The report warned of possible further significant cost increases, particularly to rectify the badly-built Liverpool project, and blamed Carillion for pricing the jobs too low to meet specifications. The two projects were expected to cost more than 40% more than their original budgets, and to be completed between three and five years late. However, due to effective risk transfer to the contractor, the total cost to the taxpayer would be very similar to the original plan. Part of the new hospital was opened early in May 2020 to provide additional critical care capacity during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. Rating In 2007, the Healthcare Commission rated Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospitals NHS Trust \\"Good\\" for 'Quality of Services' and Good for 'Use of Resources'.2007 Rating In 2009, Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospitals NHS Trust was rated \\"Excellent\\" for the quality of its services and the quality of its financial management.2009 Rating Teaching and research The Royal Liverpool University Hospital is a major teaching and research hospital for student doctors, nurses, dentists and allied health professionals.

Some 317,000 German troops were taken prisoner along with 24 generals. The Americans suffered 10,000 casualties including 2,000 killed or missing. Exploiting the capture of the Ludendorff Bridge at Remagen on 7 March 1945, the U.S. 12th Army Group under General Omar Bradley advanced rapidly into German territory south of Field Marshal Walter Model's Army Group B. In the north, the Allied 21st Army Group under Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery crossed the Rhine in Operation Plunder on 23 March. The lead elements of the two Allied army groups linked up on 1 April 1945 east of the Ruhr Area to create a massive encirclement of 317,000 German troops to their west. While the bulk of the U.S. forces advanced east towards the Elbe river, some 18 U.S. divisions remained behind to destroy the isolated forces of Army Group B. The reduction of the German pocket was begun right away on 1 April by the U.S. Ninth Army, with the forces of the U.S. First Army joining on 4 April. For 13 days the Germans delayed or resisted the U.S. advance. On 14 April, the First and Ninth Armies linked up, splitting the German pocket in half and German resistance began to crumble. Having lost contact with its units, the German 15th Army capitulated the same day. Model dissolved his army group on 15 April and ordered the Volksturm and non-combatant personnel to discard their uniforms and go home. On 16 April the bulk of the German forces surrendered en masse to the U.S. divisions. Organized resistance came to an end on 18 April. Unwilling to surrender with his rank of Field Marshal into Allied captivity, Model committed suicide on the afternoon of 21 April. Background In March 1945, the Allies crossed the River Rhine. South of the Ruhr, General Omar Nelson Bradley's U.S. 12th Army Group's pursuit of the disintegrating German army resulted in the capture of the Ludendorff Bridge across the Rhine at Remagen by the 9th Armored Division of the U.S. First Army. Bradley and his subordinates quickly exploited the crossing made on March 7, 1945, and expanded the bridgehead until the bridge collapsed 10 days later. North of the Ruhr on March 23, 1945, Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery's Anglo-Canadian 21st Army Group which incorporated the US Ninth Army launched Operation Plunder (with the airborne Operation Varsity in support) crossing the Rhine at Rees and Wesel. Battle =Encirclement= Having crossed the Rhine, both Army groups fanned out into the German hinterland. In the south, while the Third Army headed east, the First Army headed northeast and formed the southern pincer of the Ruhr envelopment. In the north, the U.S. Ninth Army, which since the Battle of the Bulge had been assigned to Field Marshal Montgomery's 21st Army Group, headed southeast, forming the northern pincer, while the rest of the 21st Army Group went east and northeast. Even before the encirclement was complete, Allied activity against the Ruhr had a critical impact on Germany's economy -- on March 26 Joseph Goebbels noted in his diary that no more coal was coming from the Ruhr.Trevor-Roper, Hugh (1978). Final Entries 1945 The Diaries of Joseph Goebbels Facing the Allied armies were the remnants of a shattered Wehrmacht, a few SS training units, and large numbers of Volkssturm (militia units for aging men, including some World War I veterans), Hitlerjugend (Hitler Youth) units, composed of boys as young as 12 as well as combat service support forces and Luftwaffe Flak crews. Encirclement of the Ruhr area (dd.mm.yyyy date format) Lead elements of the two Allied pincers met on April 1, 1945, near Lippstadt. By April 4, the encirclement was completed and the Ninth Army reverted to the command of General Bradley's 12th Army Group. Within the Ruhr Pocket some 370,000 German soldiers, 14 divisions of Army Group B and two corps from First Parachute Army, altogether the remnants of 19 divisions, and millions of civilians were trapped in cities heavily damaged by numerous bombings. Only 20% of the German soldiers or 75,000 had infantry weapons, with another 75,000 having pistols only and ammunition and fuel supplies were at critical levels. Model's requests for an airlift were dismissed out of hand by Hitler owing to Allied air supremacy. All of Model's requests to withdraw or break out before or after the creation of the pocket were denied by Hitler, who expected \\"Fortress Ruhr\\" to hold out for months and tie down hundreds of thousands of Allied troops. The staff of Army Group B knew they only had food supplies for three weeks owing to the millions of civilians that also had to be fed. =Reduction= While the main operations were directed eastwards to central and northern Germany, elements of three U.S. Armies concentrated on the pocket, taking it section by section. Model's troops put up a strong resistance along the Dortmund‚ÄìEms Canal and the Sieg river-line, holding their ground from 4 April to 9 April and launching a counterattack against U.S. 75th and 95th Divisions near Dortmund. For every German city or town that capitulated, another fought on for every building. B√ºrgermeisters of some German cities presented white flags to the invading U.S. troops, such as at Duisburg and Essen while German troops at Dortmund, Wuppertal and Hamm fought fanatically for days to the complete exhaustion of all available potential. The presence of SS troops was a common element in most instances of all-out resistance. In the south, the attack of the U.S. III Corps and XVIII Airborne Corps on 5 and 6 April was delayed by German troops, who skillfully used the rugged terrain of the 80% forested Sauerland district to force the Americans to fight for every stream, wood and town. The Germans fought strongly for the city of Siegen to prevent the Americans from gaining access to open ground. The heavily outnumbered and outgunned Germans could ultimately do nothing more than delay the advancing enemy, who covered approximately 10 kilometers per day. By 11 April German combat strength had weakened to the extent that they were only defending roadblocks and built-up areas along main roads, supported by a few tanks and assault guns or 2 cm flak guns. At one point, the Germans covered a valley in a thick smokescreen, delaying the 7th Armored Division for some time. Throughout the battle, U.S. generals in the south failed to use their two armored divisions properly, attempting to unleash them on the Germans at every opportunity but failing due to poor command decisions which left them stuck behind the U.S. infantry divisions for most of the pocket's reduction. The performance of the U.S. 13th Armored Division was particularly disastrous. Two road marches totaling 400 kilometers sufficed for a Combat Command of the 13th Armored to decline to 50% of authorized strength for its Sherman tanks by the time it reached the battle area. Completely worn out, the division was immediately thrown into action on 10 April by XVII Airborne Corps commander Matthew Ridgway, who, under pressure from army commander Courtney H. Hodges to speed up operations, ordered it to encircle and \\"destroy\\" the German forces. The division commander, John B. Wogan, and his subordinates took this order literally. Communications between its units rapidly broke down and the division was held up by a stream when it deployed to \\"destroy\\" the Germans. It failed to reach its objectives in time, and was overtaken by U.S. infantry divisions. Wogan was severely wounded by German rifle fire near a roadblock and replaced by John Millikin. On 7 April the skies cleared and the IX and XXIX Tactical Air Commands began to pound the remaining German defenders, strafing and bombing German troop concentrations and motorized and horse-drawn columns. The Allies were eager to get their hands on all German railway rolling stock and the U.S. pilots were banned from hitting this usual primary target, limiting the extent of Allied bombing operations. The rationing of U.S. artillery ammunition had been lifted and U.S. artillery in support of XVI Corps fired 259,061 rounds in 14 days. =Capitulation= On 10 April the U.S. Ninth Army captured Essen. On 14 April the U.S. First and Ninth Armies linked up on the Ruhr river at Hattingen and split the pocket in two; the smaller, eastern part surrendered the next day. Model lost contact with most of his formations and commanders on 14 April. The German 15th Army under Gustav-Adolf von Zangen capitulated on 14 April, having lost all control over its subordinate formations. The Germans had continued the fight in the pocket despite no realistic hope of relief from the start, as they were tying down 18 U.S. divisions. Rather than surrender his command, Field Marshal Walter Model dissolved Army Group B on 15 April. Already on 7 April the extent of the American advance to Central Germany had made any breakout impossible. Model's chief of staff Karl Wagener urged him to save the lives of German soldiers and civilians by capitulating. Model refused, as he knew Hitler would not authorize it. In addition, he could not reconcile surrender with the demands he placed on his officers and men throughout the war and his career. But he also wanted to save as many lives as possible for the post-war rebuilding. He decreed the discharging of all youths and older men from the army. By 17 April ammunition supplies would be exhausted, so the non-combatant troops would be allowed to surrender on that day. All combat troops were to either break out in organized formations or drop their weapons and go home, an implicit authority to surrender. Even before this order was fully transmitted, German resistance began to completely collapse on 16 April as the remnants of German divisions and corps surrendered en masse. 5th Panzer Army commander Josef Harpe was captured by paratroopers of the 17th Airborne Division on 17 April while trying to cross the Rhine to German forces in the Netherlands. The commander of the Allied XVIII Airborne Corps, Matthew Ridgway sent an aide bearing a white flag to Army Group B's headquarters, calling on Model to surrender but the Field Marshal refused, citing his oath to Hitler. When asked for instructions by the squad leader of a German unit that was still armed, Model told them to go home as their fight was over. He then shook their hands and wished them luck. The western part of the pocket continued a weak resistance until 18 April. Model tried to get to the Harz mountains through the American lines in a small column, but could not make it. Rather than surrender and face trial for war crimes, he committed suicide. German anti- Nazi resistance groups in D√ºsseldorf attempted to surrender the city to the Allied armies in the so-called \\"Aktion Rheinland\\" in order to spare D√ºsseldorf from further destruction. However, SS units were able to crush the resistance, and executed a number of those involved. Executions of foreign labourers and political prisoners by the Gestapo had already been occurring since February. The act of resistance did accomplish a cancellation of further bombings on the city by another 800 bombers, through contact with the Americans. D√ºsseldorf was captured by Americans on 17 April without any notable fighting. Aftermath =Casualties= The 317,000 German soldiers from the Ruhr Pocket, and some civilians, were imprisoned in the Rheinwiesenlager (in English, \\"Rhine meadow camp\\") near Remagen, a temporary prison enclosure. The Americans suffered 10,000 casualties while reducing the pocket. The Ninth Army lost 341 killed, 121 missing and just under 2,000 wounded. The First Army lost three times more, which would bring the U.S. casualties to 10,000. The divisions of III Corps lost 291 killed, 88 missing and 1,356 wounded, while the 8th Division of the XVIII Airborne Corps lost 198 killed, 101 missing and 1,238 wounded. Casualty totals for the 15th Army units on the western edge of the pocket are not listed in the official U.S. history. The Americans liberated hundreds of thousands of hungry, diseased and weakened prisoners-of- war and slave laborers, the former consisting mainly of Red Army soldiers who were very happy at their liberation. The liberated slaves also had a tendency to loot and terrorize the German population once released and to clog up the roads in front of the U.S. columns. The German civilians were incredulous at Germany's defeat. The Americans also witnessed the destruction inflicted on Ruhr cities and towns by the Allied bombing campaign. Most of the German industrial machinery was situated in protected or decentralized locations, had survived the onslaught unharmed or requiring only minor repairs and were quickly operational after their capture.
