The first broadcast was on July 27, 2008. Contestants compete to win ounces of silver in the competition. Silver pieces gives contestants more control over the game as well as being a take-home prize themselves. The program has been designed to have an atmosphere notably influenced by the Norse mythology and the culture of northern Europe. Structure of the program Synopsis According to the fictional description on the home website: > Asgaard was a magical and fantastic world, a world where hags, mages, and > fauns lived in harmony. But one day the evil forces of Mork took control of > our world and now only the union of the two races of human beings will be > able to bring it back into harmony. ... > From there then the inhabitants of Asgaard started a quest to find the > greatest warriors, who have to survive tests that go beyond their > imagination... and so some day the world of the gods will be saved. In the > meantime we are only able to hope... > The time has come and the moment of the battle rises. Come and visit the > world of Asgaard. Gameplay The game is divided into adventures in which the contestants, called \\"warriors,\\" prove their capabilities and determination. Two teams of two members compete to test their bravery, strength, and ability, under a time limit. The form is similar to a role-playing game, the participants using bracelets that join to activate the aleatoric watch, to give them the power to move forward through the game. The spaces are divided into two types. * blue spaces, presented by the Viking Yrm, that reveal benevolent challenges; * red spaces, presented by Trasgo, consist of traps with greater difficulty, or punishments. In these spaces players can double, triple, or quadruple the amount of silver ounces that they have the power of a watch, but this only if they obtain the prize; if not, they have to pay the cost. The two teams represent \\"Laoth\\" and \\"Kaoth\\", gods of the Sun and darkness (the Moon). These give the players protection during their collection of the silver ounces. The team that reaches the final space first receives the number of ounces that they have accumulated, and the possibility of competing in the final. Characters * Galas, played by Luis Ibar is a mage who began the search for warriors of the human race to help liberate Asgaard from the age of darkness in which it is now found. Only humans can manipulate the ounces without being affected by their enormous power. * Laya, played by Fran Meric is the queen of the fairies. Worried for her world, she has decided to ally herself with Galas in a search for warriors so that Asgaard will not disappear. * Yrm, played by Hern√°n Mendoza is a powerful Viking with strong but friendly character. He is charged with presenting the blue spaces and will make the warriors prove their mettle. This character almost always speaks with the help of Enolo. * Enolo, played by Marco Antonio Argueta is an able warrior, little known amongst the inhabitants of Asgaard. Many years ago he abandoned the lands below to live completely alone in the mountains. His race is naturally warlike, and he is considered one of the fiercest. * Trasgo, played by Roberto Casta√±eda is allied against the world of Asgaard. He is charged with presenting the red spaces and will give the players an evil turn that they have to complete to obtain ounces. His helper, Sadi, always accompanies him. * Sadi, played by Sadi Len√≠n, is Trasgo's helper, and always dresses in a medieval hood. * Mork, played by Guadalupe Mora, is the real villain of the show. Production The son of Ricardo Salinas Pliego, Benjam√≠n Salinas, debuted as producer and writer of the original idea. He told the story with the design assistance of Roberto Gonz√°lez, Pablo D√°vila and Pablo Azuela. Influences * Mork of the god of the orcs within the fictional universe of the videogame Gorkamorka. * The name of the program is one of multiple variants of Asgard, the mythical abode of the Norse gods. * Trasgo is a type of goblin known in Spanish culture.

It was first launched in 2003https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/hero-motocorp- ltd/infocompanyhistory/companyid-13636.cms and was given a cosmetic upgrade Karizma R in 2007. In September 2009, it was supplemented by another variant Karizma ZMR. Karizma got a refresh on 2014 with cosmetic and performance changes. The last models under the ZMR brand were manufactured until 2017 and sales were extended especially in the international markets through 2019https://www.team-bhp.com/news/hero-karizma-removed-website. There are plans to relaunch an improved version with 250cc to act as Hero's flagship brandhttps://motoroctane.com/news/197826-hero-karizma-zmr-bs6. Design and styling Karizma was designed specifically for the Indian market but the joint partnership with Honda, a leading Japanese automobile maker ensured that the brand was well designed and that local and international customers bought and enjoyed quality brands. There are suggestions that actually due to its high quality, the brand was sold in most countries at a bargain and affordable price than it should have been. Honda seems to have contributed a lot in the 'blending' starting with the styling being inspired by Honda VFR800. The instrument panel and the tank recesses were also designed keeping their functionality in mind. The horn came under criticism for not being loud enough.. In the initial models, the rear tyre was smaller, resulting in critical reviews which were addressed in the upgrade of 2014. Comfort and handling The sporty seating position is similar to Honda CBZ 125 F and BMW F650. Reviews have praised the handling of Karizma as \\"being easy for novice\\", \\"impeccable on straights and cornering\\" and as an \\"accomplished bike\\" in ride and handling. However the rear tyre, the handle bar and the foot pegs have been blamed in affecting the handling in the first models. Performance and fuel economy Karizma has the tried and tested, but slightly detuned version of 223 cc SOHC air-cooled engine from the CRF230 series of enduro/MX/supermoto bikes that are sold in the US and South American markets. It has a five-speed gearbox in place of the CRF's six-speed. The engine is an all-aluminium, undersquare engine (bore and stroke ) running a compression ratio of 9:1. It features a Kehlin CV carburettor with a CCVI switch. The top speed is around 130 km/h and the 0‚Äì60 km/h is achieved around 3.8 seconds. The Karizma is reported to have an overall fuel economy of 40 km/l (90 mpg or 2.4 l/100 km), with a best of 50 km/l (120 mpg) and a worst of 28 km/l (66 mpg).. Since the relaunch of Karizma R and ZMR (Fuel injection variant) in 2014, the ZMR's engine has been tuned to deliver 20ps of power with compression ratio of 9.6 and company claimed to 0 to 60 in 3.6 seconds and the same top speed as its predecessor. Both variants have an EBR inspired design https://www.motoroids.com/news/new-hero-karizma-zmr-2013-borrowed-design-cues- ebr-1190rs/. The mileage has been increased to 51 km/l. The 2014 upgrade saw the introduction of an oil cooler. The bike has been praised by many due to its affordable maintenance costs and its ability to endure long trips despite the lack of water-cooling system. Due to its joint partnership with Honda, many of its parts such as fuel pump, rear brake pads, spark plug are compatible with prominent Honda models and can be sourced by international owners on online marketing sites such as Amazon and Ebay. Due to its revered history, there has been reporting to indicate that Hero plans to relaunch the model with higher engine size to compete with other established brands.

Produced in 1969 and televised over the winter of 1969‚Äì1970, the series was remarkably bold in terms of production. It was the first fully scripted colour production by Granada Television and was filmed almost entirely on location at a time when almost all TV drama was studio-bound. It used editing techniques such as jump cuts to create a sense of disorientation and also to suggest that two time periods overlapped. For the series, the book was adapted in seven scripts (later stretched to eight) by Garner and was produced and directed by Peter Plummer. The direction was quite radical and seemed to be influenced by the avant-garde, a noted contrast to what might be expected of a children's serial.  Background  Following the success of the novel, which had won the Carnegie Medal and Guardian Award for children's literature, there was much interest in turning the story into a TV series with three companies vying for the rights. In the end, during the summer of 1968, Granada won out, approaching Alan Garner to script the series himself. The director chosen was Peter Plummer, who also acted as producer. Since the novel was based on real locations, Plummer opted to use the same places where possible but one key location Bryn Hall could not be used so these interior and exterior scenes were filmed at Poulton Hall near Liverpool, the rest of the filming took place around the village on Dinas Mawddwy, Wales. The valley and village described in the book is actually Llanymawddwy by Bryn Hall but it proved more practical to film in the larger village of Dinas Mawddwy which had better facilities allowed filming without blocking the roads. Filming began on location on 11 April and was completed on 20 June (Alan Garner recalls that location filming fell behind schedule due to 'difficulties' with some of the young lead actors and with only two days left in Wales the Granada crew effectively took control of the filming and were able to complete the shoot on time by omitting some scenes; (the taxi arriving to take Nancy out of the valley) and changing others (the children chopping down the telephone pole rather than the pole falling down in the storm).

The Stone of Gronw on the bank of the River Dovey was carved by Edward Rowlands for Granada TV's The Owl Service in 1969 Llech Ronw (The Stone of Gronw) for the series was carved by local stone mason Edward Rowlands from a brief by designer Peter Caldwell: \\"An upright piece of slab stone or slate (like a gatepost) with a 4\\" dia rough hole cut through it 1'.0\\" from the top and a roughly etched grooved pattern of circles 2'.0\\" from the top. The stone should be 5'.00\\" above the ground and 2\\".0 below. The stone should be very rough and weather-worn and will represent an ancient monument\\". After the production was finished the stone was left in situ by the River Dovey below Bryn Hall but Rowlands added his name to the carving so that his work would not be mistaken for a real ancient monument. The theme music was the traditional folk piece \\"T√¥n Alarch\\" played on the harp by Jean Bell, while the incidental music was taken from stock sources. The title sequence featured a hand shadow depicting an owl in flight, photographs of the valley and a flickering candle along with sound effects.  Cast  The parts of the three main characters Gwyn, Roger and Alison were played by Michael Holden, Francis Wallis and Gillian Hills respectively. The ages of the characters are never stated, but in contrast to the novel, where they were fifteen, for this adaptation they were slightly older, often considered seventeen. Hills and Wallis themselves were in their early twenties at the time of production, while Holden was nineteen.The Owl Service DVD - PDF material, magazine article For the older characters, well-known character actors Edwin Richfield, Dorothy Edwards and Raymond Llewellyn were employed playing Clive, Nancy and Huw. The role of Margaret was never cast - the character being frequently present, but never seen. Both writer and producer appeared in the production - Garner as one of the villagers and Plummer in a photograph as the deceased Bertram. Many of the cast later commented on the lasting effects the serial had on them, Holden commenting that it felt like \\"we were personally living the whole thing\\", while Hills said that \\"it was all so real, it was frightening\\". Llewellyn said in 2008 that the role of Huw has haunted him ever since.The Owl Service DVD booklet - Ray Llewellyn interview  Episodes  For an overall plot description see the novel's article: The Owl Service. Episode one  Holidaying in rural Wales, Alison, mother Margaret, new stepfather Clive and his son, Roger are staying at a manor house formerly owned by Alison's uncle Bertram. Alison befriends the cook's son Gwyn. Together, they discover a set of dinner plates with a floral pattern, which Alison traces and forms into paper owls. Gwyn's mother Nancy is furious and demands the plates be returned. At night, Alison becomes possessed and as Roger looks in on her, she scratches his face. *Originally transmitted: Sunday, 21 December 1969 Episode two  The half-crazed gardener, Huw, tells Gwyn of an ancient legend and hints that the three teenagers may be in danger of re-enacting the story. Alison is acting strangely as she becomes taken with the female character of the myth. In the billiard room, Clive is astonished to see the wood panelling on the wall crumbling away to reveal a picture of a woman made of flowers. *Transmitted: 28 December 1969 Episode three  Alison has hidden the plates away in a hut in the forest and becomes obsessed with the need to trace the pattern. Gwyn joins her in the hut and they spend the night there. In the morning, Huw rambles on to Gwyn that he was also one of three caught up in the legend and claims he is lord of the valley. *Transmitted: 4 January 1970 Episode four  Roger is disturbed by some photographs he has taken in the valley which seem to depict a ghost. Nancy tells Gwyn that she had an affair with Bertram and bemoans the fact that she should have been the owner of the house rather than Margaret. Margaret meanwhile has forbidden Alison to see Gwyn, but while out walking, Alison meets up with him. Unknown to them, Margaret is watching through binoculars. *Transmitted: 11 January 1970 Episode five  Alison and Gwyn become closer as they walk up the mountain, while Roger is at home feeling increasingly depressed and expresses his desire to leave to Clive. Alison and Gwyn promise to meet up every day out of sight of their parents at an agreed time, but on her return to the house, Alison is forbidden to see him. A few days later, Roger, Alison and Clive discover a locked door in the stables and wonder what's inside. Alison then realises that she is in her and Gwyn's meeting place and as he steps out of hiding, she is forced to snub him. *Transmitted: 18 January 1970 Episode six  Gwyn is furious at the treatment he has been shown by Alison and is further upset by his mother. In an attempt to bond, Alison and Roger talk together and she reveals some of the things Gwyn had told her while on the mountain. Later, Gwyn corners Alison and forces her to discuss what's going on between them. Roger shows up and mockingly tells Gwyn he knows his secrets. Gwyn is enraged and storms away, determined to leave the valley and everyone behind. *Transmitted: 25 January 1970 Episode seven  Gwyn has spent the night on a mountain when Huw catches up with him. Huw explains that the legend was re-enacted by him, Bertram and Nancy and is now being enacted again by Gwyn, Roger and Alison and can only end in pain. Gwyn is not interested until Huw reveals that he is his father. At the house, Roger decides to find out what is in the stable and goes to force open the door. *Transmitted: 1 February 1970 Episode eight  On opening the door, Roger finds a table full of paper owls - the same as Alison had been making, but these were put there by Nancy. At the house, Gwyn has returned but is told by Nancy they are leaving. Struggling through the heavy rain with their cases, Gwyn tells her he is staying and she leaves him behind. Alison has become completely possessed by the legend and collapses. Huw takes her inside as scratches and feathers appear all over her. In panic, Roger attempts to help, but Gwyn refuses. Finally, Roger manages to talk Alison out of her state by realising the pattern on the plates was of flowers, not owls. *Transmitted: 8 February 1970  Broadcast and reception  During a test screening of episode one prior to broadcast, the concern was raised by Granada that the story was difficult to follow, so recap sequences were added to the start of each episode which explained the story so far. On original broadcast, due to a technicians' strike, the series was transmitted in black and white. Many contemporary reviews were complimentary about the production although some expressed the concern that it was not suitable for younger viewers. The Observer said that it was \\"far more than an ordinary children's story\\" and made comment on \\"the adult passions working themselves out in the three adolescents\\".The Observer. Review by Ronald Bryden, February 1970 The Sun commented that the serial would have the whole family \\"glued\\" for the next eight weeks, stating that it was \\"the most gripping, creepy serial we have seen on TV for a long time\\".The Sun. Series review and preview, December 1969 After the first episode was screened, the Daily Mail said that it had \\"all the makings of a first class horror story\\".The Daily Mail. Episode One review, December 1969 In 1970, ITV nominated the series for the Prix Jeunesse - the leading award for children's films. The series failed to succeed as Plummer later explained: \\"the jury in Munich found it 'deeply disturbing' and questioned whether it was not indeed reprehensible to offer such material to young people\\"\\"I've Seen a Ghost\\" Radio interview with Peter Plummer, 1979 Owing to this the series proved difficult to sell to overseas companies. During the 1980s however, many did purchase the series and was screened for the first time in countries such as Spain and Ireland. Still, some cuts were made to the episodes (such as Gwyn's \\"Dirty- minded bitch\\" line and Alison's scream in the final episode) although perhaps the most striking scene - a sequence from episode 3 depicting Gwyn's struggle with Alison in what appears to be a simulation of rape - remained intact. More recently, reviewer Kim Newman said \\"It's unthinkable that something as complex, ambiguous, difficult and strange as The Owl Service could be broadcast on British television in a prime time slot these days - let alone on ITV1 as a children's programme\\", comparing elements of the series to experimental directors such as Alain Resnais or Chris Marker and concluding it as a \\"classic\\".The Owl Service DVD, \\"Unexplained Mysteries\\" by Kim Newman, 2008 Today, The Owl Service is considered by many to be a landmark in children's drama and has been hailed as a classic production and daring in its presentation. The serial was repeated in 1978. This resulted in Granada placing an end cap with a copyright date of 1978 which might have confused viewers who didn't realise it was actually produced nine years earlier. According to the TV Times, this repeat was a tribute to cameraman David Wood who had died a few months earlier. No reference was made to the murder of Michael Holden (who had been killed in an unprovoked pub attack the previous year).Daily Mail, 31 May 2008, \\"Violent End for Owl Service Star\\" A further repeat took place on Channel 4 in 1987. Despite its success, The Owl Service was never issued on VHS, but was released on DVD in April 2008. An audio dramatisation of The Owl Service was produced and transmitted by BBC Radio 4 in 2000.

His father, also Thomas Shaw, was a leading string player and early 18th-century concert director in Bath, England. Shaw's earliest known performance was in Bath in April 1769, but he was clearly an accomplished player by then, for during the following autumn and spring of 1770 he led the orchestra in Thomas Linley's subscription concerts. He was a member of the theatre band in 1771 and his first known composition, an overture, was performed in a concert at the end of December. By 1772 he was playing his own compositions in Bath and Bristol but difficulties with Thomas Linley made London a more attractive centre for him and his last known performance in Bath was in November 1774. That same year Six Favourite Minuets by Shaw were published by Thomas Whitehead in Bath. In 1776 Shaw was admitted to the Royal Society of Musicians and was a member of the Drury Lane band by 1778. From 1786 until the early 19th century he led the band, and Charles Dibdin thought him a much better leader than Covent Garden's Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten. By 1790 Shaw had published some promising instrumental works and compiled an afterpiece opera, The Island of St Marguerite which premiered at Drury Lane on 13 November 1789. In 1791, he wrote an overture for the revival of Michael Arne's Cymon; both these overtures were published in parts, probably in the early 1790s to judge from their title pages. Thereafter, Shaw composed only the occasional song for Drury Lane, even though he later became one of the theatre's proprietors. Sheridan's failure to pay him led to severe financial difficulties, and his debts eventually drove him abroad. He seems to have been in Paris when he composed the funeral anthem for Princess Charlotte of Wales in 1817, which was published soon after. Shaw may have entertained Haydn to lunch on 14 September 1791; Haydn confided in his second London notebook that Mrs Shaw was ‚Äòthe most beautiful woman I ever saw‚Äô.

The summit of the island is the mountain with a height of . Located in the Kuroshio Current, the area has abundant sea life, and is popular with sports fishermen and scuba divers. History During the Heian period, Minamoto no Tametomo was banished to Izu ≈åshima after a failed rebellion, but per a semi-legendary story, escaped to Hachij≈çjima, where he attempted to establish an independent kingdom, and he built his castle on the more easily defended Hachij≈çkojima. Although the legend has not been verified with historical or archaeological evidence, Hachij≈çkojima has been inhabited since at least the Muromachi period. As with neighboring Hachij≈çjima, during the Edo period, the island was a place for exile of convicts. As the strait separating Hachij≈çkojima from Hachij≈çjima has a strong current preventing escape by raft or swimming, the more serious criminals were isolated on the island. Its use as a prison came to an end in the Meiji period. During this time, there were two hamlets on the island: in the northeast, and in the southwest. These hamlets became part of the town of Hachij≈ç in 1955. The population peaked at 513 residents in the Meiji period, but by 1955 the population had shrunk to only 50. In 1965, the remaining residents voted to abandon the island, citing lack of basic public services (including electricity, health care and schools) and the island's inability to support more than a very basic subsistence lifestyle.

Biography  He was the son of Ignacio de Navarro, a Spanish Army captain and Livia B√∫falo, a Sicilian noblewoman. He entered the Spanish Army at the age of eight and fought in the War of Spanish Succession in Italy. In 1708 he fought the Moors in Oran, where his brother Ram√≥n was killed and his father died in captivity. In 1709 he returned to Spain and fought in the Battle of Almenar and the Battle of Zaragoza, where he was made prisoner by the troops of Guido Starhemberg. After the signing of the Peace of Utrecht, he became captain of his late father's company, and participated in the pacification of Catalonia. After the war, he joined the Navy and at the outbreak of the War of the Quadruple Alliance, he sailed on the Real to Sardinia and Sicily with the Army under the Marquis of Lede, and took part in their conquest as part of the Spanish Navy Marines. Navarro was also an important author of several books on military theory. Under protection of Jos√© Pati√±o, he rose through the ranks. In 1732, he participated in the conquest of Oran under the Duke of Montemar and played an important role in covering the landing troops by the use of his naval guns. In the War of Austrian Succession he won his greatest victory in beating a British fleet in the Battle of Toulon (1744). He was promoted to lieutenant general (Teniente G√©neral) and received the title of marqu√©s de la Victoria (marquis of Victory). After the battle his fleet remained blockaded in Cartagena, by a fleet of 21 ships under Rear-Admiral William Rowley. On March 15, 1750 he became Director General of the Armada. Six years later he finished his Diccionario demostrativo de la configuraci√≥n y anatom√≠a de toda arquitectura naval moderna. He had entered the Real Academia Espa√±ola in 1740. In 1759, he commanded the convoy of 36 ships that brought Charles III, the new King of Spain, from Naples to Spain. His flagship was the El F√©nix (80 guns) with his son-in-law Gutierre de Hevia as captain. For this safe passage, he received a golden baton and was made Captain General of the Spanish Navy on December 13 of that year. The last assignment of the 80-year-old Marqu√©s de la Victoria, was to organize a squadron of nine ships which escorted Infanta Mar√≠a Louisa to her husband Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor, and brought back Maria Luisa of Parma, who was to marry Charles IV of Spain.

Graduated from Roman Catholic High School in Philadelphia in 1901. He studied for the priesthood at St. Charles Borromeo Seminary, Overbrook PA. In 1907 he gained a scholarship to the American College of Louvain. He was ordained to the priesthood there on July 11, 1909, by Henry Gabriels. After ordination Guilday briefly studied at the University of Bonn, but returned to Louvain University to work on his doctorate, which he obtained there in 1914. His doctoral dissertation was supervised by Alfred Cauchie. While working on his doctorate, Guilday visited archives in France, Belgium, Spain, and Italy and spent a year in London, working as a priest at St Mary of the Angels, Bayswater, while attending lectures in history at the University of London. His doctoral dissertation was published in London in 1914 by Longmans, Green and Company under the title The English Catholic Refugees on the Continent, 1558‚Äì1795, volume 1. Guilday intended to follow this up with a second volume on the Irish Colleges on the Continent, but research for this was made impossible by the outbreak of World War I. Instead, in 1914, Guilday began teaching at Catholic University of America, Rector Thomas J. Shahan having asked Edmond Francis Prendergast, Archbishop of Philadelphia, to release him from diocesan duties so that he could join the faculty. During the war, Guilday also served as secretary to the National Catholic War Council's committee on historical records and as assistant district educational director in the Students Army Training Corps.

A radio or cellphone tower on top of the mesa, a recent addition to the mesa top, constructed around the year 2006. History In the late 1960s the top of Redonda Mesa (along with several parcels in the valley below) was purchased from the Rancho California Land Company by Edward E. Sharp of Newport Beach, California, a leading real estate broker in the region. During the 1970s, prior to the development of fiber optic transmission capabilities, the mesa's unrestricted views from San Diego County to Orange County made it the ideal location for a microwave relay station which was the backbone of telephone communications in the era. AT&T; purchased on the top of Redonda Mesa from the Sharp Family Trust and in about 1981. The company built a high tower with numerous white \\"cones\\" pointed toward transmission and receiving stations in the Oceanside and San Clemente areas. The tower served the region for about a decade and then fell into disuse as new technologies took over. Looking to divest itself of the surplus property, AT&T; sold Redonda Mesa back to the Sharp Family Trust in 2002. The trust then sold it to Sherbert Massinger, who remodeled the site's unique microwave relay tower into a newly- refurbished residence on 20 acres with ocean views of Catalina, San Clemente and the Coronado Islands off of Mexico on a clear day.

It existed from the beginning of the 12th century to the Protestant Reformation. History The bishopric was formed early in the 12th century out of the southern portion of the Diocese of Bergen, which had included until then the whole of Western Norway (Gulating). Reinald, an Englishman and most probably a Benedictine monk from Winchester Cathedral, was the first Bishop of Stavanger. With the money given him in 1128 by King Sigurd Jorsalefarer, for allowing that monarch to marry one Cecilia during the lifetime of his consort Queen Malmfrid, Reinald began the cathedral and founded the chapter. He was hanged at Bergen in 1135 by King Harald Gille upon his refusing to pay fifteen marks of gold to that monarch, who suspected him of concealing the treasures belonging to King Magnus IV of Norway. Reinald's successor, John Birgerss√∂n, was translated to the archdiocese of Trondhjem in 1152, as was also Bishop Eric Ivarss√∂n in 1188. The great quarrel lasting from 1294 to 1303, which Bishop Arne (1276 ‚Äì 1303) had with his chapter, was terminated only by the intervention of King Haakon, who decided in favour of the chapter and decreed, among other things, that they should have a voice in all nominations to, and deprivations of, benefices in the diocese. Bishop Gutterm Paalss√∂n (1343 ‚Äì 1350) died of the Black Death. His successor, Arne Aslakss√∂n, also died suddenly at Avignon, where he had gone to seek a dispensation super defectu natalium. Pope Clement VI then appointed Sigfrid, a Swedish Dominican, Bishop of Stavanger by papal provision in 1351. Most of his successors were appointed in the same way after agreement with the king. In 1352 Sigfrid was transferred to Oslo, while Gyrd Asless√∂n, who had just been appointed to that bishopric, had to accept in 1354 the less lucrative See of Stavanger. He was soon succeeded by Botolph Asbjornss√∂n (1355 ‚Äì 1381), who gave his library to the chapter and compiled a Domesday Book (Jordebog) for the diocese. It has since disappeared. Bishop Audum Eivindss√∂n (1426 ‚Äì 1455) built many churches and gave the episcopal tithes of Valdres to the Brigittines of Munkeliv Abbey near Bergen in 1441 in their hour of need. The last Catholic bishop was Hoskuld Hoskuldsson (1513 ‚Äì 1537), who was taken prisoner by Thord Rod at Bergen and died there. The only monastery of importance was the Augustinian Utstein Abbey, founded in about 1280. The bishops of Stavanger had many disputes with the abbots of Utstein. In 1537 the abbey was handed over to Thrond Ivarss√∂n, who had however to maintain the monks. Other monasteries are said to have existed in the Diocese of Stavanger, but little or nothing is known of them. There was a hospital dedicated to St. Peter at Stavanger itself.

Prior to repatriation in 1968, this military strategic area remained under the control of U.S. military occupation forces.Zicus, Sandra. (2001) Geography The three main groups which comprise the Bonin Islands are at the northern end of the archipelago. All the islands together comprise only 61 square kilometers; and they are: Mukojima * ‚Äîthe northernmost cluster. :* :* :* ::... plus a few outcrops, the most remote northerly one is Minamijima, a small island in Chichijima group * ‚Äîthe middle cluster. :* :* :* :* ::... plus islets known only as :::* :::* :::* Hahajima * the ‚Äîthe southernmost cluster. :* :* :* :* ::... plus a few other small and miscellaneous islands known as :::* :::, west of the Bonin Islands * , to the south: *and two isolated islands to the south: ** , far to the west ** , far to the east Ecology The islands are part of the distinct and biodiverse Ogasawara subtropical moist forests ecoregion, and are home to many endemic species. Lessons learned the hard way from the experience of the Galapagos Islands are potentially paradoxical. The ecosystem fragility is well documented; and it suggests comparisons with the cautious development history of the Galapagos. Culture The islanders also stress the uniquely multicultural roots of the Ogasawara life, where roughly one-tenth of the Japanese population is descended from early European and American settlers, with some families going back up to seven generations.

There are two types of coats in the breed: smooth coat and long coat. The smooth-coated variety was previously known as the Russian Toy Terrier and long-coated as the Moscow Long-Haired Toy Terrier. Both were brought together under the same Russian Toy Terrier name in 1988 and the \\"Terrier\\" was dropped from the name when the breed was added in 2006 to the official list of breeds registered with the F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale and has been registered in the Foundation Stock Service of the American Kennel Club since 2008, allowed to compete in AKC companion events since 2010. The first official breed standard of the two varieties was written in 1966 in Russia. The breed was nearly wiped out twice; first in the 1920s with the rise of Communism due to the toy dog's traditional link to the aristocracy and again in the 1990s with the influx of foreign breeds following the fall of the Iron Curtain. The smooth coat type is the older of the two, with the long coat type first appearing in 1958. Until the 1990s, the breed was almost unknown outside of Russia, and so relatively few details on associated health issues are known. The Russian Toy was originally bred as a rat fighter and as a watchdog, and can still exhibit the vocalization expected from the latter. It is a friendly dog and can become very attached to the family unit. Due to its size and similarities to the Chihuahua, the two are often compared. Description The Russian Toy is one of the smallest breeds in the world, measuring between 20 cm and 28 cm and weighing anywhere between 1 kg and 3 kg. It has a small, distinctive head with large eyes and triangular ears. In countries where docking is prohibited, the tail is curved in the shape of a sickle. There are two types in the breed, distinguished by their coats; one is long-coated and the other smooth-coated. The smooth-coated dog has a short, shiny, close-lying coat. The long-coated variety has a longer coat and profuse feathering in the ears, legs and tail. The feathering or \\"fringe\\" on the ears is usually 3 to 5 cm long, can be straight or with a slight wave. It will be grown by the age of three and should completely cover the outer edges and tips of the ears. The smooth coat type of the breed closely resembles the Pra≈æsk√Ω Krysa≈ô√≠k breed of the Czech Republic. The Pra≈æsk√Ω on average is a little shorter on leg and a little heavier than the Russian Toy. Both of the Russian Toy varieties can be crossed and produce smooth- and long-coated puppies from the same litter. In addition, when two smooth-coated dogs are bred together, they may occasionally bear a long-coated offspring if the long hair gene is present in their pedigrees. However, there have been no records of two long-coated Russian Toys breeding together and producing smooth-coated offspring. The breed has four main colors: black and tan, blue and tan, brown and tan, and solid red of various shades. Red includes sable (red where the tips of the hairs are black, known as overlay) and red sable (red with brown overlay). Health Portrait A Russian Toy will often require the help of a veterinarian to remove any retained deciduous teeth (known as \\"puppy teeth\\" or \\"baby teeth\\") that fail to fall out and make way for the permanent teeth. Without this intervention, usually done under anesthetic, the baby and permanent teeth will occupy the same socket in the jaw, which can cause tartar deposits, tooth decay, gingivitis and periodontitis, and can lead to premature loss of teeth. Retained puppy teeth can also cause misalignment of the teeth. As with most breeds of dog, the Russian Toy can suffer from patellar luxation, which is where the knee cap slips out of place when the knee bends as the groove that normally holds it in place is too shallow. It is usually an inherited defect, which occurs during the development of the foetus and rarely by trauma. Russian Toys can suffer from bone fractures due to their small and sometimes delicate nature. Temperament Active and cheerful, the Russian Toy was originally bred both as an anti-rat dog and a watch dog. The second quality is still active in the breed, and they can be very vocal. They can become quite attached to their family, regardless of the ages of the family members. Russian Toys are usually very reserved with strangers, but very loyal to their owners, always ready to protect them from any perceived danger. History A smooth-coated Russkiy Toy The first evidence of English-style terriers in Russia can be seen in the Museum of Zoology in Saint Petersburg. On display is an English style terrier dated 1716-1726 with a sign that reads \\"This dog is a short hair terrier named Lizetta. It personally belonged to the Russian Emperor Peter the Great.\\" Indeed, the breed was developed as a companion dog for the Russian nobility. According to some accounts, records indicate that eight smooth-coated Russian Toys competed in a dog show in Saint Petersburg as far back as 1874. The more generally accepted first reference to the breed appears in May 1907 when 11 Russian Toys were shown at an exhibition in Saint Petersburg. In 1923, two dogs appeared at a Moscow dog show and in 1924, three more were awarded medals at a show in Odessa. But as a result of the October Revolution, the Russian Toy diminished in popularity and in numbers as these types of dogs were closely linked to the aristocracy and therefore frowned upon. In 1947, only one dog was shown in Saint Petersburg. When breeding began to revitalize the stock of Russian Toys in Russia, only a few of the dogs left had pedigrees or were purebred. The lack of numbers and political isolation of the country at the time caused the creation of a new breed quite distinct from the former English style toy dog as breeders sought to stabilise the remaining toy sized terriers into a standard breed. The resulting contemporary Russian Toy has most of the features of the classic toy terrier, with the addition of some new characteristics. The head is high but not wide, the cheeks are flat and the eyes are round. By 1960, 76 dogs were entered into an exhibition and the first standard for the two Russian Toy varieties was written in 1966 and authorized by the Ministry of Agriculture. In 1988, the Russian Kynological Federation published a new breed standard, combining the short-coated Russian Toy Terrier and the long-coated Moscow Toy Terrier under \\"Russian Toy Terrier.\\" However, after the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989, the popularity of imported exotic breeds nearly drove the Russian Toy into extinction. A resurgence occurred thanks to a new energetic generation of dog breeders, but the breed remained virtually unknown outside of Russia until the 1990s. Several kennels have now been established outside Russia, the most successful ones located in Finland, Estonia, Belarus, Ukraine and Czech Republic. Interest in the breed is on the rise in the US and Japan. The Russian Toy was provisionally recognised by the Federation Cynologique Internationale in 2006 and gained definitive recognition in 2017. The United Kennel Club and the Foundation Stock Service of the American Kennel Club both accepted the breed in 2008 Russian Toys are also recognized by the American Rare Breed Association and International All Breed Canine Association.  Development of the long-coated Russian Toy  A long-haired Russian Toy puppy The original long-coated Russian Toy is arguably a dog named Chikki born on 12 October 1958 to two smooth-coated dogs that both had slightly longer hair than was typical. Initially, the puppy was not to be registered as its coat was too long meet the breed standard, and usually such dogs would not participate in breeding programs and would often be put down. Chikki, however, was registered with a pedigree and purchased by Evgeniya Fominichna Zharova. Zharova is thus the long-coated variety's founding breeder as the first breeder to intentionally retain and breed a dog with a longer coat. Chikki developed an ear fringe and was mated with a female named Irma, who also had a longer coat than most smooth-coated dogs, and together they produced a litter of three long-coated puppies. Zharova developed the breed in Moscow, and so it came to be known as the Moscow Toy Terrier. The breed made its first appearance at a dog show in 1964 and the standard was set in 1966. Ten years after Chikki's birth, between 1968 and 1969, approximately 300 long- coated dogs were registered ‚Äì a significant number considering that Russian Toy litters tend to be small, typically one to three puppies. Today, the long- coated variety has an established presence in Poland, the Czech Republic, Estonia, the Ukraine and a number of other countries, but the breeding program is particularly strong in Finland. The first Russian Toy was brought to Finland in 1988 when a long-coated male named Black-Champion-Bonaparte was imported from Russia and registered by Sirpa Lehtinen under Kennel Jojamint's. A female named Ste-Shihu was brought later that same year from Estonia by the same owner, and the two produced Finland's first Russian Toy litter (Jojamint's Agostini and Jojamint's Alboreto) also in 1988. Black-Champion- Bonaparte and Ste-Shihu were the first Russian Toys to appear in a dog show in Finland in 1989. American Kennel Club history A Russkiy Toy The Foundation Stock Service (FSS) of the American Kennel Club (AKC) accepted the Russian Toy into its records in August 2008, and in July 2009, the Russian Toy was approved to compete in AKC companion events from 1 January 2010 onwards. Russian Toys can also be shown and earn Certificate of Merit Points at FSS Open shows.http://www.akc.org/reg/fss_news.cfm In 2008, the AKC board and FSS also acknowledged the Russian Toy Club of America (RTCA).Foundation Stock Service of the American Kennel Club The following year, the AKC board and FSS acknowledged Russian Toy Dog Club of America, Inc. (RTDCA). In 2010 this second club, RTDCA, decided to become the National Club for the Russian Toy breed in the United Kennel Club (UKC), where it became known as the Russkiy Toy Dog Club of America, Inc. (RTDCA). In 2013, the RTDCA was asked by AKC to separate into two distinct clubs with different officers to form two independent clubs: one to represent the AKC club and the other to represent the UKC Club. The AKC Russian Toy Dog Club of America added the word \\"The\\" to their name and became The Russian Toy Dog Club of America (TRTDCA) while the UKC club retained the original Russkiy Toy Dog Club of America name (RTDCA). In August 2013, AKC stated that the two clubs RTCA and TRTDCA must combine into one club to represent the Russian Toy breed in the AKC.

The last chief of the clan died in the 18th century. Because the clan does not have a recognised chief, it is considered an armigerous clan, and has no legal standing under Scots Law. Historically, the clan inhabited lands west of Loch Awe, in Argyll. These clan lands were centred at Loch Tromlee, where an island castle served as the clan seat. The line of Clan McCorquodale chiefs, first recorded in the 15th century, has been untraced since the 18th century. Origin of the name The surname McCorquodale is an Anglicisation of the Gaelic MacThorcadail (or MacCorcadail), meaning \\"son of Torcadal\\". The Gaelic personal name Torcadal is of Norse origin and means \\"Thor's kettle\\" (a more romanticised meaning for the name has been given as \\"cauldron of the thunder spirit\\"). In 1881, the surname was most frequent in lands which constitute the current Paisley postcode area. This, more or less, corresponds with the Clan McCorquodale's traditional lands in Argyll. The clans Macleod of the Lewes and Gunn claim variations of this surname as septs of theirs. Septs are families which claimed allegiance to stronger chief and his clan, or that lived upon lands controlled by a stronger chief and his clan. The majority of those McCorquodales recorded in 1881 were located far from the traditional lands of these two clans. History of the clan Eilean-a-Bharain (\\"the baron's island\\") on Loch Tromlee. The ruinous castle upon the island was once the seat of the chiefs of Clan McCorquodale. The founder of the clan, according to legend, was a Thorkil (Torcadal) who was a member of the Scots army under Kenneth MacAlpin. The legendary story states that Alpin, father of Kenneth MacAlpin, was killed in battle, and his head was carried off by enemy Picts. Alpin's head was then displayed in the Pictish town of Camelon. The story goes on to state that the claimed ancestor of the McCorquodales, Thorkil, recovered Alpin's head. For this deed, Thorkil was said to have been rewarded with lands on Loch Awe side. Be that as it may, the earliest record of the clan occurs in the 15th century. The Barons McCorquodale are recorded at this time, as holding sway over lands in Argyll, west of Loch Awe. They were centred at Phantelane (Anglicised from the Scottish Gaelic: Fionnt Eilean), or the \\"white island\\". Eilean-a-Bharain (from Scottish Gaelic: \\"the baron's island\\") was located in Loch Tromlee, on which their castle was located. Today the loch has been affected by drainage, the site of the castle ruins is no longer always an island. At one point in time, the entire shore of Loch Awe from Avich to Ard-an-aiseig was owned by the chiefs of the clan. In 1434 Ewan, son of Ewan Makcorquydill received a grant of lands. In his charter, Ewan was described as \\"Lord of Maintelan\\". According to Black, this refers to \\"Phanteland\\". As time passed the McCorquodales of Phantelands became the most prominent family of McCorquodales. In 1542, the lands held by the Barons McCorquodale where incorporated into a free barony. In 1556, the seal of Duncan McCorquodale of Phantelane bore the legend, \\"S.duncan.mak.corkatill\\", which surrounded a shield with, a stag trippant couped halfway paleways. By 1612, Duncan was dead and his younger sons, Iain and Lachlan, were declared by the Privy Council as \\"notorious thieves and the supporters of Clan Gregour\\". These MacGregors were wanted for many crimes, including the theft of a brown mare from the deceased Duncan. The barony passed from Duncan to his son, Duncan. According to Moncreiffe, this baron seems to have had sons by different wives, as the legitimacy of his heirs was \\"hotly disputed between the two litters\\". In the 17th century the clan supported the Campbells in the Civil wars. In 1645, while campaigning, Alasdair MacColla and his men marched along the shore of Loch Tromlee. MacColla ordered his men to leave the castle and lands of the McCorquodales to be left un-molested. At the same time, Baron McCorquodale had his men standing to with orders not to fire. However, one of McCorquodale's men opened fire upon MacColla's men, and as a result one Macdonald clansman was killed. In retaliation MacColla ordered the destruction of the island castle of the McCorquodales. Duncan McCorquodale of Phantelane was one of the Justices of the peace for Argyllshire, appointed in 1656 by Oliver Cromwell. In the 18th century, the last Baron McCorquodale to hold the clan lands around Loch Tromlee died, leaving the clan without a chief to this day. By the end of the 18th century there were McCorquodales living on Loch Aweside, who claimed to be descended from the legendary founder of the clan. Clan profile This tartan, adopted by MacCorquodales, dates from 1819. It was originally recorded as an \\"Argyll\\" tartan. It is one of several tartans recognised by the chief of Clan Campbell, as suitable for Campbells of Clan Campbell of Cawdor. ;Crest badge Today, those who profess to be members of Clan McCorquodale are permitted to wear a crest badge which shows their allegiance to the clan. Crest badges are of relatively recent origin, and usually consist of strap and buckle surrounding the clan chief's heraldic crest and motto. The crest badge suitable for a member of Clan McCorquodale contains the Latin motto: vivat rex, meaning \\"long live the king\\"; and the crest of a stag at gaze proper attired gules. These two heraldic elements are derived from the coat of arms of \\"Duncan Macorquodaill of that Ilk\\", registered in 1672. These arms are recorded in the Lyon Register as argent, a stag gules attired Or issuing from a fess wreathed of the second and third. In Scotland, it is against the law to appropriate the arms of another individual. Even the heraldic elements of the clan member's crest badge, do not belong to members of Clan McCorquodale, but to the clan's chief (or last recognised chief).

He still was an officer after the Mongol Empire conquered the Jin following the Mongol‚ÄìJin wars, but later he became a monk. However his teacher thought that his talent should not be buried, so he recommended Liu Bingzhong to Kublai Khan, to become his adviser. During this period, he was extolled as the Five Talented in Xintai. He was credited with occult powers which allowed him to foretell the future and so assist military operations. Liu had a paramount influence on Yuan era city designs, and he is known to have planned both the Yuan capital of Dadu and its summer capital Xanadu (Shangdu). Liu Bingzhong and Yao Shu made a plan \\"to canvass all talented to give well-governorship suggestions\\". Many Confucianists, such as Xu Heng, Wang Xun, Zhang Yi, were attracted to provide ruse to Kublai Khan, who later became the founder of the Yuan Dynasty. After the Battle of Diaoyu Fortress, M√∂ngke Khan died and Kublai Khan succeeded his post. Liu Bingzhong suggested to name the new dynasty as \\"Da Yuan\\" (; \\"Great Yuan\\") with reference to I Ching, which was adopted by Kublai Khan in 1271. He also suggested Kublai Khan adopt Chinese law over that of Mongol law, and removed some Mongolian misgovernment. Kublai Khan recognized Jin's Central Capital as the capital of the Yuan, and renamed it to Dadu (\\"Great Capital\\"). Liu Bingzhong was the planner and the original architect of the Capital Construction of Dadu. Liu also designed and planned the layout of the Yuan's summer capital at Xanadu (Shangdu).

He won two straight games from a 1‚Äì3 deficit and held the lead at 4‚Äì1 in the seventh (he lost the set 11‚Äì9). Later, he beat Ma 4‚Äì1 at the 2013 World Table Tennis Championships in the Round of 64. After progressing to the Round of 16 and beating Vladimir Samsonov 4-3, he lost in the quarter-finals to the Bronze medalist, Xu Xin, in 6 games. This is regarded as his best performance in his adult career and was considered to have performed the best out of all of the non-Chinese players. He is ranked 17 in the world as of January, 2017.

Hawadit al-mashawir Taxi is about urban sociology in the Egyptian capital through the voices of taxi drivers. The author recounts the stories of different taxi drivers he encounters and offers some insight into contemporary Cairo and Egypt. Writing Taxi is written mainly in dialect. A tradition of writings in dialect has always existed in the Arab world, but colloquial Arabic has never achieved real literary approbation. However, in recent years a new generation of young Arab authors has begun an innovative literary movement known as al- Riwaya al-Gadida (The New Novel), linked to the phenomenon of bloggers. Taxi is an important literary achievement because it has become a bestseller. Taxi was reprinted 7 times in one year and it sold more than 75,000 copies in a country, Egypt, where 3,000 books sold is considered a success.

Originally ( from 1068 ) the diocese served all the area of Gulating: the modern counties of Hordaland, Sogn og Fjordane, Rogaland, Vest-Agder and Aust-Agder - and the regions of Sunnm√∏re, Valdres and Hallingdal. When the Diocese of Stavanger was established, around 1125, the counties of Rogaland, Aust-Agder and Vest-Agder were transferred to the new diocese - together with the regions of Valdres and Hallingdal ( and the parishes of Eidfjord and R√∏ldal from Hordaland ). The region Sunnm√∏re was transferred to the Archdiocese of Nidaros some time after 1152 - to secure more income for the Archdiocese. History The discovery at Selja in 996 of the supposed remains of St. Sunniva and her companions led King Olaf Trygveson to build a church there. It was not, however, till 1068 that a bishopric and a monastery were founded at Selje by King Olaf Kyrre. Bernard the Saxon was the first bishop, but he later removed to the newly founded city of Bergen, where he died as its first bishop about 1090. The diocese was originally a suffragan of the archdiocese of Hamburg-Bremen, from 1104 on of that of Lund. In 1152 Bergen became a suffragan of the new metropolitan See of Trondhjem, and a cathedral chapter was set up there. Bishop Paul ( 1156 ‚Äì 1194 ) saw the completion of the Cathedral of Christ Church in time for the holding of a provincial council there and for the coronation of King Magnus Erlings√∂n, the first coronation of a Norwegian king, in 1164. In 1170 the relics of St. Sunniva were translated to the cathedral. During the episcopate of Bishop Arne ( 1226 ‚Äì 1256 ), on 29 July 1247, Cardinal Wilhelm of Sabina crowned King Haakon Haakonss√∂n. In 1271 the Royal Chapel of the Holy Apostles at Bergen was made collegiate. In 1275 Magnus VI of Norway founded a great church, as his new royal chapel at Bergen, to receive a relic of the Crown of Thorns. The dean took the title of Master of the ( fourteen ) Royal Chapels and was granted the right to use the episcopal ornaments. Bishop Arne Sigurdss√∂n ( 1305 ‚Äì 1314 ) regarded the privileges of the Chapel Royal at Bergen as an encroachment upon the rights of his see. He could not, however, deprive the dean, Finn Haldorss√∂n, of his semi-independent position, as the latter had the support of the Holy See. Arne also asserted in vain his claim that the bishop of the F√¶r√∂e Islands should be chosen amongst the clergy of the Diocese of Bergen. He was, however, successful in compelling the German merchants at Bergen to pay tithe. Bishop Thorstein ( 1342 ‚Äì 1349 ) died of the Black Death, as did nearly all the Norwegian bishops. To his successor, the Englishman Gisbrith ( 1349 ‚Äì 1369 ), we owe the Bergen Manuscript (Bj√∂rgynjar k√°lfskinn). Aslak Bolt, Bishop of Bergen from 1408, was translated to the See of Trondhjem in 1430. Bishop Thorleif Olafss√∂n ( 1430 ‚Äì 1450 ), having joined Olaf Nilss√∂n at the Brigittine Convent of Munkalif, was killed there by the Germans of the Hansa on 1 September 1455. The last Catholic bishop, Olav Torkelsson ( 1523 ‚Äì 1535) allowed the Cathedral of Christ Church, the Royal Chapel of the Apostles, the Dominican convent, and other ecclesiastical buildings in Bergen to be destroyed, when the fortress of the Bergenhus was enlarged. His successor, Geble Pederss√∂n, became a Lutheran. The Abbey of St. Michael's, Munkalif ( Benedictine monks, 1108 - 1426; Brigittines, 1426 ‚Äì 1470 and 1479 ‚Äì 1531; Cistercian nuns, 1470 ‚Äì 1479 ), lay close to Bergen. The city and its suburbs contained in all 26 churches. Elsewhere there were the Cistercian Abbey of Lyse, colonized from Fountains Abbey, Yorkshire, in 1146, and the Hospital of the Holy Spirit at Halsn√∏y Abbey ( about 1200 - 1539 ). Councils at Bergen Eighteen provincial councils were held at Bergen. The most important were the following: *The council of 1164 confirmed arrangements made in 1152 by the legate Cardinal Nicholas Breakspear ( afterwards Pope Adrian IV ), with regard to the Norwegian Church. Their object was the establishment of the hierarchy by the following means: (1) the establishment on a firm basis of the Archbishopric of Trondhjem; (2) the foundation of cathedral chapters; (3) the assertion of the right of the Church to inherit property by will; (4) the enforcement of clerical celibacy. *The council of 1190 decreed the excommunication of all of guilty sacrilege, violence towards clerks, rape, or of unlawful bearing arms in church and at public assemblies. King Sverre's Christian Law ( Christenret ) was published at this council. *The council held in 1273 decided that parish churches in Iceland should belong to the bishop of the diocese and not to the landowners. A number of articles were also framed with a view to a reconciliation between Church and State, but they were never accepted either by pope or king. *In 1280 many rules with regard to excommunication were made but not carried into effect, as the quarrel between Church and State broke out with renewed violence. *At the council of 1320 a large number of regulations were made with regard to discipline. In 1327 the canons adopted at the provincial synod dealt with the relations between Church and State. The last provincial synod at Bergen was held in 1435. It dealt with the collection of money for the maintenance of the Council of Basle, the superstitious observance of Saturday, which was forbidden, and unauthorized begging on the part of religious.

Thomas of Woodstock was one of Shakespeare's sources for his Richard II, and Edmund Ironside has been attributed to Shakespeare by some commentators. Some of the plays, like The Two Noble Ladies and the two Heywood works, are judged to be autograph scripts, in the handwriting of the authors. (The Escapes of Jupiter consists of excerpts from Heywood's The Golden Age and The Silver Age.) The untitled masque in the collection has strong commonalities with the work of George Chapman; it borrows a long passage from The Tragedy of Byron, suggesting Chapman influence rather than authorship.J.

He has been a member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly since 2004, representing three successive seats: Charters Towers (2004‚Äì2009), Dalrymple (2009‚Äì2017) and Hill (2017‚Äìpresent). He has variously represented the National Party (2004‚Äì08), the Liberal National Party (2008‚Äì11) and Katter's Australian Party (2011‚Äìpresent). Knuth was born in the Queensland town of Tully. His brother Jeff Knuth is a former One Nation parliamentarian. Shane Knuth entered the state parliament as the member for Charters Towers at the 2004 state election by defeating incumbent MP Christine Scott of the Labor Party on One Nation preferences. At the 2006 state election, Knuth was re-elected with a large swing. Charters Towers was abolished in a redistribution ahead of the 2009 state election, and Knuth opted to contest the new seat of Dalrymple. The new seat merged most of his former territory, including the city of Charters Towers, with part of the former seat of Tablelands, represented by One Nation MP Rosa Lee Long. The new seat had a notional LNP majority of 57 percent, and Knuth won with only a small swing against him. On 30 October 2011, Knuth resigned from the Liberal National Party to join Katter's Australian Party. Though most LNP MPs at the time were former Nationals like Knuth, Knuth contended the merger had been a Liberal takeover that had been \\"disastrous\\" for regional representation, and left rural MPs shut out of decision-making. Knuth also cited reports that the LNP's organisational wing grilled candidates, and had paid a former Labor official for compromising information on Labor MPs, including their sexual behaviour, as having influenced his decision. At the 2012 state election, despite a massive swing to the LNP statewide, Knuth easily retained his seat, defeating his replacement as LNP candidate by a nearly 2-to-1 two-party margin, winning enough primary votes to retain the seat outright. He was re-elected almost as easily in 2015. Dalrymple was abolished in a redistribution ahead of the 2017 election, and Knuth transferred to Hill, essentially the northern portion of his old seat. Although it was notionally a marginal Australian Party seat, Knuth won it on a massive swing of almost 15 percent, turning Hill into a very safe seat in one stroke.

It was written as a gift for Mi√©ville's terminally ill mother, who was a fan of the latter genre.Monster-free China: Mieville's The City & The City, at Suvudu, by Chris Schluep; published 4 May 2009; retrieved 5 December 2012 The novel was published by Macmillan on 15 May 2009. The novel won the Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel, Arthur C. Clarke Award, World Fantasy Award, BSFA Award and the Kitschies Red Tentacle; tied for the 2010 Hugo Award for Best Novel, and was nominated for a Nebula Award and John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel. A four-part television adaptation by the BBC was broadcast in 2018. Synopsis Inspector Tyador Borl√∫, of the Extreme Crime Squad in the fictional East European city-state of Bes≈∫el, investigates the murder of Mahalia Geary, a foreign student found dead in a Bes≈∫el street with her face disfigured. He soon learns that Geary had been involved in the political and cultural turmoil involving Bes≈∫el and its \\"twin city\\" of Ul Qoma. His investigations start in his home city of Bes≈∫el, lead him to Ul Qoma to assist the Ul Qoman police in their work, and eventually result in an examination of the legend of Orciny, a rumoured third city existing in the spaces between Bes≈∫el and Ul Qoma. Setting The City & the City takes place in the fictional Eastern European twin city-states of Bes≈∫el and Ul Qoma. A precise location is not confirmed, but they are close to the sea as Bes≈∫el is noted as having developed on a \\"curl of coastline\\" from \\"a port hiding a few kilometres up the river to shelter from the pirates of the shore.\\"Chapter Five, page 42 on Google Books Other references in the novel remain vague, but indicate the cities are to the east of Hungary, north of Turkey and are within driving distance of Varna and Bucharest, suggesting a location in the Balkans near the Black Sea. These two cities actually occupy much of the same geographical space, but via the volition of their citizens (and the threat of the secret power known as Breach), they are perceived as two different cities. A denizen of one city must dutifully \\"unsee\\" (that is, consciously erase from their mind or fade into the background) the denizens, buildings, and events taking place in the other city ‚Äì even if they are an inch away. This separation is emphasised by the style of clothing, architecture, gait, and the way denizens of each city generally carry themselves. Residents of the cities are taught from childhood to recognise things belonging to the other city without actually seeing them. Ignoring the separation, even by accident, is called \\"breaching\\" ‚Äì a terrible crime for the citizens of the two cities, even worse than murder. The origin of this odd situation is unclear, as it started at an uncertain time in the past, perhaps before recorded European history. Residents of the cities speak different languages that use distinct alphabets. Bes≈∫ is written in a Greek-derived alphabet resembling Cyrillic while Illitan, the language of Ul Qoma, is written in a Latin alphabet. However, Bes≈∫ and Illitan have a common root and share a degree of mutual intelligibility. The cities also have different religions: Bes≈∫el's state religion is the Bes≈∫ Orthodox Church and there is a small Jewish and Muslim community, while Ul Qoma is officially secular, though religions other than the Temple of the Divine Light face discrimination. The twin cities are composed of crosshatched, alter, and total areas. Total areas are entirely in one city, the city in which the observer currently resides. Alter areas are completely in the other city, and so must be completely avoided and ignored. Between these are areas of crosshatch. These might be streets, parks or squares where denizens of both cities walk alongside one another, albeit \\"unseen\\". Areas that exist in both cities usually go under different names in each one. There is also Copula Hall, \\"one of the very few\\" buildings to exist in both cities under the same name. Rather than being cross-hatched, it essentially functions as a border. It is the only way in which one can legally and officially pass from one city to another. Passing through the border passage takes travellers, geographically (or \\"grosstopically\\"), to the exact place they started from ‚Äì only in a different city. From a physical standpoint, little differentiates the two cities, other than slight differences of architecture, vehicles and styles of dress which citizens and visitors are trained to recognise. Those who do not know about the separation might naturally view the two cities as one. Because of this, an extra power is needed to keep the separation in place: this organisation is known as Breach. When a 'breach' takes place (used here in the sense of 'breaching' the barrier between the two cities), Breach comes to take care of it. Members of the Breach organisation use their powers to take the breacher captive, and bring them to an unknown punishment. \\"Breachers\\", as they are called, disappear and are never seen again. Children and tourists, however, are treated more leniently: children may be forgiven for a small breach; if tourists breach, they are bundled out and banned from both cities forever. Most breaches are taken care of by Breach immediately, but its surveillance capabilities are not absolute. Sometimes Breach must be specifically invoked to investigate a crime that seems to be a clear-cut case of breach, such as a smuggling operation that involves breaching to transport the smuggled goods from one city to the other. To invoke Breach, the police must present their evidence to an Oversight Committee composed of 42 members, 21 from each city. If the evidence presented is convincing enough, the Committee performs whatever other investigation into the matter it deems appropriate to resolve any remaining doubts its members have. If its investigation concludes to its satisfaction that a breach has taken place, then and only then will it invoke Breach. Invoking Breach is a last resort because it is an alien power to which some consider that Bes≈∫el and Ul Qoma surrender their sovereignty at their peril.

The Faroe Islands are now included in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Copenhagen. History As recorded in the F√¶reyinga saga, Sigmundur Brestisson came to the Faroes and converted the people to Christianity more or less one by one. He was eventually attacked at his home by his first (forced) convert, Tr√≥ndur √≠ G√∏tu, swam to another island to escape, and was finally killed by a farmer for his gold jewelry. There is some confusion as to when the first bishop for the islands was consecrated, as Adam of Bremen notes that a self-proclaimed bishop of Helgoland was referred to in Latin as the bishop of \\"Farria.\\" The bishops of the Faroe Islands were usually chosen from the canons of the Diocese of Bergen and were originally suffragans of the Archdiocese of Hamburg-Bremen. The diocese was granted to Lund in 1104 and then Ni√∞aros after 1152. The see was based at Kirkjub√∏ur, which legend holds was given to Bishop Orm by G√¶sa Sigursdottir as a penance for her having eaten meat during Lent. Amund Olafson was the last Roman Catholic bishop of the islands and was forced to yield his see and title to the Lutheran superintendent, Jens Riber. Later, only \\"provosts\\" were elected. The Catholic clergy were unable to resist the advance of Lutheranism. By the end of 16th century, the Catholic faith had disappeared. In the Catholic era, at least, no little attention paid to the construction and adornment of churches, as may be seen from the ruins of the unfinished Magnus Cathedral of Kirkjub√∏ur. The thick basaltic walls broken by high, massive windows are evidence that the original builders meant to erect a Gothic church. It remained unfinished.

He has contributed to the use of synthetic biomaterials to heal bone injuries, especially to an approach termed osteoinduction that aims at designing biomaterials that trigger the surrounding cells to form new bone tissue in vivo. One example of this contribution to osteoinduction is a paper published in collaboration with Joost de Bruijn and Huipin Yuan. Following other laboratories, and in collaboration with Jan de Boer, Hemant Unadkat, and others he has contributed to applying high-throughput screens to select biomaterials, an approach termed materiomics. The scientific publications that include him as an author can be found here.  Career  van Blitterswijk graduated from a bachelor in cell biology at Leiden University. He defended his PhD thesis in 1985 at the same university on artificial ceramic middle ear implants under the supervision of Jan Grot and Klaas De Groot, for which he was awarded the Jean Leray young scientist award from the European Society for Biomaterials in 1987. From 1985 to 1996, he worked on hydroxyapatite biomaterials for middle ear implants under the mentorship of Jan Grot and Klaas De Groot at Leiden University. In 1996, he left Leiden University and co-founded, along with Klaas De Groot, IsoTis, a former publicly traded life sciences company. He acted as a CEO of IsoTis from 1996 to 2002.

Hong Kong has high standards of medical practice. It has contributed to the development of liver transplantation, being the first in the world to carry out an adult to adult live donor liver transplant in 1993.Live Donor Liver Transplantation: Current Status Both public and private hospitals in Hong Kong have partnered with the Australian Council on Healthcare Standards (ACHS) for international healthcare accreditation. There are also polyclinics that offer primary care services, including dentistry. The Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine of the University of Hong Kong and Faculty of Medicine of The Chinese University of Hong Kong are the two major tertiary institutions nurturing medical professionals in Hong Kong. Every year, over 200 medical undergraduates completed their studies and join the medical workforce.https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201905/22/P2019052200234.htm For postgraduate medical education, The Hong Kong Academy of Medicine is an independent institution with the statutory power to organise, monitor, assess and accredit all medical specialist training and to oversee the provision of continuing medical education in Hong Kong. In addition, The Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada has also accredited the postgraduate medical education (1994‚Äìpresent) in Hong Kong and allowed these graduates from the Hong Kong Academy of Medicine seeking RCPSC Certification and practising in Canada. A study published in 2016 found that around 8% of the population had avoided seeing a doctor because they couldn‚Äôt afford to. Staffing Hong Kong has about 1.9 doctors per 1000 people, which is the same ratio as in Taiwan. Of the over 14,600 doctors in Hong Kong, about 60% work in private practice and the remaining 40% work in the public service. The majority of doctors in Hong Kong, graduated from one of the 2 local medical schools. There are over 1,200 doctors in Hong Kong that graduated from medical schools outside of Hong Kong and passed the rigorous Hong Kong licensing requirements including an examination. These doctors, represented by the Licentiate Society, are known as Licentiates of the Medical Council of Hong Kong (LMCHK). In addition, there are a few hundred colonial doctors; a legacy of the pre-1997 era in which said doctors graduated from medical schools of Commonwealth origin and were automatically given full registration to practice. There are over 7400 registered practitioners of Traditional Chinese medicine. Public healthcare Subsidised treatment, with small co-payments, is available to people with a Hong Kong identity card and to resident children under the age of 11. Between 2007 and 2011 public spending on healthcare increased by 30%. In 2014/5, it was about 17% of all government expenditure. Emergency medical services, used by about 2.2 million each year costs about HK$1,230 per patient. Hospital Authority The Hospital Authority is a statutory body established on 1 December 1990 under the Hospital Authority Ordinance to manage all 42 public hospitals and institutions in Hong Kong. It is mainly responsible for delivering a comprehensive range of secondary and tertiary specialist care and medical rehabilitation through its network of health care facilities. The Authority also provides some primary medical services in 74 primary care clinics. Hong Kong has only two comprehensive medical faculties, the Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong and the Faculty of Medicine, Chinese University of Hong Kong, and they are also the sole two institutes offering medical and pharmacy programs. Other healthcare discipline programs are dispersed among some other universities which do not host a medical faculty. Private healthcare There are 12 private hospitals in Hong Kong. The government has proposed a Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme in order to encourage more use of the private sector.  Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme (VHIS)   Background  The Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme (VHIS) is one of the major medical healthcare reforms proposed by the government. In Hong Kong, the public and private sectors complement each other under a well-established dual-track healthcare system. However, there is an increasing imbalance between the two sectors. Public hospitals take up more than 88% of in-patient services with heavy government subsidies.Legislative council. (2016).

Retrieved from http://www.legco.gov.hk/yr1516/english/panels/hs/hs_hps/papers/hs_hps20160419cb2-1314-2-e.pdf Due to aging population, the rising demand of citizens on good quality healthcare service provision and escalating medical costs, the recurrent expenditure of the government on medical and health care services increased continuously, from $32 billion in 2007 to $52 billion in 2014.Information Services Department. (2014). Government launches public consultation on Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme. Retrieved from http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201412/15/P201412150257.htm With such huge demand on public medical services, the quality of healthcare provided would inevitably be affected by the heavy workload of the medical staff and proportionally less medical resources per person. Thus, the government proposed the VHIS to recalibrate the balance between public and private healthcare systems by encouraging more well-off citizens, especially the middle-class, to use the private healthcare services as an alternative. Thus, the public sector can focus on providing services in its target areas, thereby enhancing the long-term sustainability of the dual-track healthcare system.

Retrieved from http://www.fhb.gov.hk/en/press_and_publications/consultation/HCS.HTM. = The Health and Welfare Bureau (predecessor of the Food and Health Bureau (FHB)) appointed scholars from the Harvard University to conduct a research on the financing and organisation of health care in Hong Kong. A report titled ‚ÄúImproving Hong Kong‚Äôs Healthcare System: Why and for Whom?‚Äù was published. While they suggested that Hong Kong had an equitable and efficient healthcare system, there was insufficient oversight on the system. The report also raised doubt on the long-term financial sustainability of the system. The report suggested that, in the short run, the government should adopt a two-tier mandatory health insurance scheme consisting of the ‚ÄúSavings Account for Long Term Care (MEDISAGE)‚Äù and ‚ÄúHealth Security Plan (HSP)‚Äù, which require both employers‚Äô and employees‚Äô contribution. Also, the ‚ÄúCompetitive Integrated Health Care Option‚Äù should be adopted in the long run. It refers to the establishment of a Health Security Fund to pay a standard payment rate to public or private healthcare provider chosen by a patient, thereby realising the principle of ‚Äòmoney follows the patient‚Äô. Under the plan, Government funding would not automatically go to the public health sector. Consultation was conducted alongside the publication of the Harvard Report.

He was interim governor of the province of Antwerp from 7 April 1831 until 14 June 1831 and governor of the province of Li√®ge from 4 June 1831 until 4 October 1832. Life To 1830 Tielemans' parents belonged to the mercantile middle class in Brussels. He finished secondary school in Brussels then studied law at the university of Liege. For his doctorate in 1823 he produced a thesis entitled De jure et natura legitimae secundum jus civile et hodiernum (Luik, Collardin, 1823). He joined the bar in Brussels and was also active as a journalist, especially for the Journal de Gand. In 1827 he was commissioned by the Minister of Education in Germany and Austria to study the relationship between Roman Catholic Church and Protestant authorities. He stayed in Vienna and Berlin in 1828 before returning to Brussels, where he was made a secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In October 1829 he was transferred to The Hague. However, if the government had hoped that these appointments would win Tielemans over to their side, they were mistaken. Tielemans befriended Louis De Potter and increasingly became an opponent of the government, writing articles for Le Belge and Le Courrier des Pays-Bas. In 1827 he published one statement about the press and another in favour of the printer Weissenbruch, arguing that a printer could not be prosecuted if the author of an article was known. In 1829 he published a Brief aan Van Maanen (Letter to Van Maanen) who had responsibility for the ministry (Brussel, Coch√©-Mommens, 1829). This brochure went down badly with the Minister of Justice and the ministry began to put Tielemans' correspondence with De Potter under surveillance. On 15 February 1830 Tielemans was arrested and imprisoned in Brussels. Tielemans, De Potter and Adolphe Bartels then had to appear before the court of assizes to answer to charges of inciting revolt against the government. Tielemans was sentenced to seven years' exile and went to live in Paris, where he formed a committee to help Belgian political refugees. He was a founding member of the first Soci√©t√© des douze. Belgian Revolution On receiving a letter informing him of the Belgian Revolution, he returned to Brussels and on 6 October 1830 the Provisional Government appointed him a member of the Constitutional Committee and Administrator-General (effectively minister) of the Interior. He was very busy in the second of these roles - he had to organise the administration, national, provincial and municipal elections, schools, public works and measures regarding trade, agriculture and industry, among others. In the sitting of the National Congress of Belgium on 9 December 1830 he released a reportHuyttens, vol. IV, p. 336 reflecting the difficulties he had encountered and the seriousness and complexity of the situation as it had materialized. Tielemans belonged to the small minority of liberal republicans who preferred unionist cabinets. He was the only member of the Constitutional Committee in favour of a republic, whilst all the others favoured a constitutional monarchy. From 26 February to 23 March 1831 he was minister of the interior in the first cabinet under regent Erasme Louis Surlet de Chokier, but he was dismissed after only one month. Next, on 4 June 1831, he was made governor of Liege, holding it until 4 October 1832, when he was appointed advocate-general to the court of appeal by the conservative minister of the interior Barth√©l√©my de Theux de Meylandt, who wished to replace Tielemans as governor with a Catholic. However, the minimum age for a senior member of the judiciary was 35 (Tielemans was then 33), so this was a veiled demotion rather than a promotion. Minister of Justice Joseph Raikem alleged this had been a mistake, but in the meantime a new governor of Liege had been appointed so Tielemans could not return to this post. This left him nothing but to return to his legal practice, this time at the Liege bar (during his governorship he had in 1832 stood as a candidate in the legislative elections, but his opponent won a few votes more and was elected). This did not last long, since on 9 October 1834 he met the age requirement and was made a judge at the court of appeal in Brussels. In 1859 he became Chairman of the Chamber in 1867 and first President, until his retirement in 1871. He was also co-founder and was professor of administrative law at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, where he was also rector (1849‚Äì1861). He spent 33 years teaching. In 1834 he and Charles de Brouckere founded the R√©pertoire de l'administration et du droit administratif de Belgique in twenty volumes. In 1865 he received the Annual Prize for the Five Moral and Political Sciences. In 1847‚Äì48 he was also a member of parliament, but had to leave due to the law on incompatibility. From 1855 to 1877 he was also a councilor of Brussels. He was made a corresponding member of the Koninklijke Academie in 1875, full member in 1878 and director in 1887. Works Tielemans had several legal and political texts published in the form of brochures, such as: * L‚ÄôUnion et la Constitution, r√©ponse √† un anonyme, Luik, Jeunehomme, 1832 p. * De la charit√© publique, Brussel, Weissenbruch, 1855. * De la propri√©t√© industrielle (Rev.

Many sources, though not ITIS, recognize one subspecies, Rhabdophis tigrinus formosanus of Taiwan. Description The dorsal color pattern is olive-drab green with black and bright orange crossbars or spots from the neck down the first third of the body. The belly is whitish. The average length is usually 60‚Äì100 cm (24-39 inches).Rhabdophis tigrinus lateralis at Animal Pictures Archive. Accessed 21 September 2008. Geographic range Found in eastern Russia (Primorskiy and Khabarovsk), North and South Korea, China (widespread, except in the western third and the extreme south; Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hubei, Guizhou, Sichuan, Gansu, Shaanxi and Inner Mongolia), on the island of Taiwan, in Vietnam and in Japan (Yakushima, Tanegashima, Ky≈´sh≈´, Shikoku, Honshu, Osaka and in the Ryukyu Islands). The type locality given is \\"Japan\\". Feeding and defense The diet consists mainly of small vertebrates, especially frogs and toads. These snakes forage using both chemical (smell/tongue) and visual cues to find their prey. When these snakes are challenged at cooler temperatures they tend to demonstrate passive anti-predator responses such as flattening their neck and body and lying still while at higher temperatures they more frequently flee instead. This species has two nuchal glands in its neck that sequester steroid irritants obtained from eating poisonous toads as a predation defence. This snake thus appears to rely more heavily on the deterrence provided by these glands at low ambient temperatures. Although venomous, few deaths have been recorded due to its tendency to display one of these other behaviors as opposed to striking. This hesitancy to strike at a predator in turn may be because its fangs are located in the back of the mouth, making a successful strike on a large object difficult.

The book was released on 20 August 2009 in the United Kingdom, ending the series that began in 2004 with the publication of Wolf Brother. Plot summary Ghost hunter is the final book in the series. Set in the high mountains, it tells of Torak's battle against the most fearsome of all the Soul-Eaters, Eostra the Eagle Owl Mage, who seeks to rule both the living and the dead, using the Fire Opal. As winter approaches and Souls' Night draws near, the Eagle Owl Mage holds the clans in the grip of terror. To fulfil his destiny, Torak must seek her lair in the Mountain of Ghosts. He must defy demons and tokoroths, and find his way through the Gorge of the Hidden People. Wolf must overcome terrible grief. Renn must make an agonizing decision. And in the final battle against the Soul-Eater, Torak must face the most heart-rending choice of all. But Torak is half dead and half alive. He dies with Eostra the Eagle Owl Mage and Wolf fights with his spirit to return to the body. Read Ghost Hunter to find out the full story. And remember, Torak is the Spirit Walker... Background Writing The book's author, Michelle Paver, wrote on 18 December 2008, the following on her official website: \\"I'm working extremely hard on the sixth and final book in the series, Ghost Hunter. I'm happy to say that it's going really, really well. However, it is quite a weird sensation to be writing the final book. At the moment, it seems inconceivable that I shall soon by saying goodbye to Torak, Renn and Wolf. I know that I'll miss them terribly. In another way, though, I know that I'll be delighted and proud to have brought Torak's story to a dramatically satisfying conclusion. \\" Paver confirmed in her official podcast that the Soul Eater Eostra will be a main character in the book. She said that writing the book had given her bad dreams, particularly the parts with Eostra, but she considered it to be a good sign. Cover Paver said: \\"A week ago, though, I had a conversation with John Fordham, who designs the cover, and I told him the bare bones of the story, so he could start thinking of the cover. Given the themes in the book, it will probably be purplish, and Wolf and Torak may feature prominently. I sent John a photograph of an amazing Stone Age cave picture of an eagle owl. It's tens of thousands of years old, and yet could have been made by Eostra yesterday. Seriously spooky. Who knows what designs it will inspire?\\" Setting Paver said on her official website that she would be travelling into the mountains to get inspiration for the book. She also said that she hoped to meet some eagle owls at close quarters, a hint that the book would feature Eostra.

He won five gold and five bronze medals at eight Paralympic Games from 1988 to 2016, along with two silver medals at the 2014 Glasgow Commonwealth Games. Early life Modra was born in the South Australian town of Port Lincoln on 27 March 1972, and was born visually impaired due to juvenile optic atrophy. His sister, Tania Modra, piloted Sarnya Parker in tandem cycling at the 2000 Sydney Games, where the pair won two gold medals. Career Modra with his cycling pilot and wife Kerry Modra during the 1 km Time Trial at the 2000 Summer Paralympics Modra and his pilot Scott McPhee at the 2012 London Paralympics Modra began pole vaulting in 1987 and won the pole vaulting competition at the 1989 Australian All-School Championships. He competed in athletics at the 1988 Seoul Paralympics where he competed in the Men's 1500 m B3 and Men's Javelin B3., retrieved 23 January 2012. He took up swimming to aid his recovery from a knee injury, and began competing in the sport in 1990. At the 1992 Paralympics in Barcelona, where he competed in both athletics and swimming, he won two bronze medals in the Men's 100 m Backstroke B3 and Men's 200 m Backstroke B3 events. Modra then switched to road and track cycle racing in 1995, because it was a \\"mode of transport\\". At the 1996 Atlanta Games, where he was piloted by his future wife Kerry Golding, he won a gold medal in the Mixed 200 m Sprint Tandem open event. In 1998 and 1999, he held an Australian Institute of Sport Athletes with a Disability scholarship. At the 1998 UCI Para-cycling Track World Championships in Colorado Springs with pilot Kerry Modra, he won gold medals in the Mixed Tandem Sprint B, Mixed Tandem Time Trial B and Mixed Individual Pursuit B. He competed in the 2000 Sydney Games, but did not win any medals at those Games. Modra's pilot, Kerry, was pregnant with the couple's first child at the games, and fainted due to low blood pressure during a quarter-final sprint race; Modra's sister, Tania, was his pilot for the rest of the games. At the 2002 IPC World Cycling Championships in Altenstadt, Germany with pilot Darren Harry, he won gold medals in the Men's Tandem Sprint Time Trial and Men's Tandem 1 km Time Trial. Leading up to the 2004 Athens Games, Modra was piloted by David Short and Robert Crowe for sprint and endurance events, respectively. Shortly before the games, he was evicted from the Australian cycling team due to a successful appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport by fellow tandem cyclist Lyn Lepore, on the grounds that she deserved her place in the team because when each of Modra's pilot‚Äìrider combinations was counted separately, she had a higher rank than Modra. The day before the opening ceremony, the Australian Paralympic Committee successfully appealed to the International Paralympic Committee to give Modra an extra place in the team. At the 2004 games, he won two gold medals, in the Men's Individual Pursuit Tandem B1‚Äì3 event, in which he broke a world record with a time of 4:21.451, and the Men's Sprint Tandem B1‚Äì3 event, and a bronze medal in the Men's Road Race / Time Trial Tandem B1‚Äì3 event. In the second of the three races in the individual sprint semi-final, Modra and Short fell off their bike after its front tyre rolled off the wheel. Despite having skin torn off their arms, legs and shoulders in the fall, they won the third semi-final race and rode in the final 45 minutes later, where they won the gold medal. The individual pursuit (B&VI; 1‚Äì3) world record was broken by Modra and Tyson Lawrence in Bordeaux on 21 August 2007, in a time of 4:20.891. He broke his own world record in the preliminary round of the individual pursuit (B&VI; 1‚Äì3) with a time of 4:18.961, piloted by Lawrence, they broke the record again in the final with a time of 4:18.166. At the 2008 Summer Paralympics, Modra represented Australia with Lawrence in the 1 km time trial (B&VI; 1‚Äì3) and individual pursuit (B&VI; 1‚Äì3) events, winning a bronze and gold medal, respectively. In 2011 Modra made a return to the bike with new pilot Scott McPhee where they won gold in the tandem B&VI; 4 km pursuit at the 2011 Montichiari UCI Para-cycling Track World Championships setting a new world record of 4:17.780. They placed 2nd at the Sydney road world cup in the tandem road race and 3rd in the tandem road time trial at the 2011 Segovia world cup. In the lead up to the road world championships in September Modra suffered a broken collarbone and fractured hip due to a fall in training. His recovery was swift and he returned to the bike a month later to win the Oceania 4 km pursuit championship. In December 2011, he collided with a car while cycling to work, breaking two vertebrae in his neck and one in his spine; this accident hampered his preparations for the 2012 London Games. He won a gold medal at the games in the Men's Individual Pursuit B with McPhee. At the 2014 UCI Para-cycling Track World Championships in Aguascalientes, Mexico, he teamed with pilot Jason Niblett to win the silver medals in the Men's Sprint B and Men's B 1 km Time Trial. With pilot Jason Niblett, he won two silver medals in the Men's tandem sprint B and Men's tandem time trial at the 2014 Glasgow Commonwealth Games. At the 2016 Montichiari UCI Para-cycling Track World Championships, Modra won gold with pilot David Edwards in the Men's Tandem 4 km Pursuit. At the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Paralympics, Modra and his pilot David Edwards won the bronze medal in the Men's Road Time Trial B. His other results were sixth in the Men's Individual Pursuit B and fifth in the Men's Road Race B. Personal life Kerry in 2008 showing the gold medal that they won in the 200 m sprint event at the 1996 Atlanta Paralympics Modra married Kerry Golding in May 1997, whom he met at a friend's 21st birthday party, and they had three daughters. Death Modra died after he was hit by a car travelling in the same direction on the Sturt Highway in Kingsford on 13 November 2019. He was cycling from Gawler to his uncle and aunt's house near Tanunda to join a ride with them in the Clare Valley.

His career spanned more than five decades (1928‚Äì1980), during which he made substantial contributions to the evolution of the art and science of film and television sound.  Career  In 1928, James G. Stewart was one of the first employees of the newly established company RCA Photophone. Initially, his job was to install and maintain film sound reproduction systems in movie theaters on the east coast of America, including Radio City Music Hall in New York City. Film sound recording and reproduction was a new medium at that time, and Stewart's knowledge of radio made him a significant figure in the integration of sound into motion pictures. His employers sent him to the West Coast in 1929 to supervise theater installations. In 1930, Stewart joined RKO Pictures (then owned by RCA), working in their research and development department on a noise reduction system for optical film sound. When corporate interest in the project waned, he was able to move to RKO's production arm as a 'boom man', recording production sound (the \\"live sound\\" recorded at the same time as the picture). For the next several years, he participated in the making of some of Hollywood's earliest sound film classics, including A Bill of Divorcement (1932) and The Lost Patrol (1934). After working in the production phase of the filmmaking process for several years, Stewart switched to post-production. From 1933 to 1945, Stewart was Chief Re-recording Mixer at RKO, personally mixing hundreds of film soundtracks. The most celebrated aspect of Stewart's work during this period is his collaboration with director Orson Welles, also with a background in radio. He worked closely with Welles on Citizen Kane (1941) and The Magnificent Ambersons (1942). Both Welles and Stewart had tremendous insight into the creative use of narrative sound, and these films demonstrated the spectacular heights to which the cinematic arts can be taken. Stewart left RKO Studios in 1945, when he was hired by David O. Selznick. He was eventually appointed Head of Technical Operations for Selznick International Pictures and oversaw every aspect of production and post- production for such films as King Vidor's controversial Duel in the Sun (1946), Alfred Hitchcock's The Paradine Case (1947) and William Dieterle's Portrait of Jennie (1948). In an era when network television was beginning to challenge the film industry for audiences, Stewart worked for Glen Glenn Sound, where he stayed for the next 25 years. Early television post-production emphasized speed and efficiency over artistic innovation, and Stewart's daily routine involved mixing two half-hour shows a day, five or six times the pace he had previously kept during the making of A-level films. Among the dozens of programs he worked on were I Love Lucy, The Jack Benny Show, The Real McCoys and The Andy Griffith Show. By the mid-1970s, Stewart had changed employer once more, this time to The Burbank Studios (owned by Warner Bros.), where he spent the last five years of his working life. During this time he worked on such films as Martin Ritt's The Front (1976) and Paul Schrader's Blue Collar (1978). In 1980, after a career of more than five decades in film and television, Stewart retired.  Partial filmography  Stewart worked on over 250 films during his fifty years as a re-recording mixer.Weaver, John Michael. ‚ÄúJames G. Stewart: Post-Production Pioneer‚Äù Among these were Little Women (1933), The Gay Divorcee (1934), The Lost Patrol (1934), Of Human Bondage (1934), The Last Days of Pompeii (1935), Swing Time (1936), Bringing Up Baby (1938), Room Service (1938), Gunga Din (1939), The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1939), Abe Lincoln in Illinois (1940), Swiss Family Robinson (1940), The Curse of the Cat People (1944), Murder, My Sweet (1944), Spellbound (1945), Duel in the Sun (1946), Portrait of Jennie (1948) and Johnny Got His Gun (1971).

While at RKO Studios, he participated in the production of the first three-strip Technicolor feature film, Becky Sharp (1935), made by RKO affiliate Pioneer Pictures. During his tenure at RKO, he also helped design the studio's first mixing console specifically built for film re-recording and to introduce electronic compression into film post-production. For the film Portrait of Jennie in the late 1940s, Stewart devised an early incarnation of multichannel 'surround sound' technology. Working primarily in television after 1950, Stewart helped usher in such technical advances as reversal (\\"rock and roll\\") re-recording.  Technical and historical papers  James G.

Once abundant over much of North America and Eurasia, the grey wolf inhabits a smaller portion of its former range because of widespread destruction of its habitat, human encroachment of its habitat, and the resulting human-wolf encounters that sparked broad extirpation. Considered as a whole, however, the grey wolf is regarded as being of least concern for extinction according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources. Today, wolves are protected in some areas, hunted for sport in others, or may be subject to extermination as perceived threats to people, livestock, and pets Wolves tend to quickly adapt to change, and are often referred to as an indicator species; a species delineating an ecoregion or indicating an environmental condition such as a disease outbreak, pollution, species competition or climate change. Wolves do not seem to be able to adapt as readily to expanding civilisation the way coyotes do. While human expansion has seen an increase in the latter's numbers, it has caused a drop in those of the former. center  Europe  Wolves in the Iberian Peninsula A wolf in Italy A wolf in Belarus A wolf in Turkey Europe, excluding Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, has 12,000 wolves in over 28 countries. Portugal has a stable wolf population of 200‚Äì300, which is afforded full protection. Compensation is paid for livestock damage. Spain's wolf population is estimated at 2,000‚Äì3,000 and growing. Their population is concentrated in two autonomous communities: around 700 in GaliciaEl lobo extiende su √°rea de distribuci√≥n por el 94 % del territorio de Galicia.

Wolves are considered a game species, though they are protected in the southern regions of the country. Compensation is paid for livestock damage, though this varies according to region.

A southern relict population has survived in Andalusia, although contrary to the populations in the northwest and centre of the country, it is not doing well. Italy's wolves are a protected species with current estimates indicating that there are over 2000 wolves living in the wildGalaverni, M., Caniglia, R., Fabbri, E., Milanesi, P., & Randi, E. (2016). One, no one, or one hundred thousand: how many wolves are there currently in Italy?. . Mammal Research, 61(1), 13-24.. The population is steady.Esposito 2007, pp. 14-15. The largest concentrations of wolves occur in the Italian national parks in Abruzzo, mostly in the Abruzzo, Lazio e Molise, in Calabria, in the Pollino and Sila, on Appennino Tosco-Emiliano, and, more recently, on the Alps. Isolated individuals have been sighted in the vicinity of human populated areas such as Tuscany, Bologna, Parma and Tarquinia. Wolves have also been sighted denning 25 miles from Rome, with one small population living in the regional park of Castelli Romani.Parco Regionale dei Castelli RomaniWolves: From Brink of Extinction to the Edge of the City Currently, Italian wolf populations are said to have been increasing at a rate of 6% a year since the 1970s, though 15% of the total Italian wolf population is reported to succumb annually to illegal poaching and road accidents. Compensation is paid by regional governments for livestock damage. Italy's leading wolf biologist, professor Luigi Boitani of the Sapienza University of Rome, expressed concern that the Italian wolf recovery may have been too successful, due to a large portion of the public refusing to concede to the possibility of rising wolf populations requiring management in the future. France's population is said to be more than 500 individuals and growing rapidly. Wolves crossed over into Southern France from Italy through the Alps in the 1990s. Estimates in 2005 put the figure at between 80 and 100.Christian Science Monitor, 3 Nov 2005 Under the Berne Convention, wolves are listed as an endangered species and killing them is illegal. Official culls are permitted to protect farm animals so long as there is no threat to the national population as a whole.Wolf Song of Alaska: France's Bardot Demands EU Action on Wolf Cull Compensation is paid for livestock damage. Germany's wolves were first spotted in 1998, and are thought to have migrated from western Poland. In 2007, there were around 200 wolves in 36 packs roaming in Germany, most of them in the eastern German region of Lusatia. In July 2012, for the first time in 150 years, wolves were born in Heidekreis in Lower Saxony, which confirms the spread of wolves from the eastern part of Germany. In October 2014 Lower Saxony already had a wolf population of circa 50 animals: 5 packs, all with confirmed pups in 2014, 2 confirmed mated pairs and one territorial unpaired female. By 2019, Germany's total wolf population had grown to about 1300 individuals in 105 packs, most of them living in Brandenburg (41 packs), Saxony (22 packs) and Lower Saxony (21 packs). Under German law wolves are a protected species; in several regions livestock damage compensation programmes exist. In Belgium and the Netherlands wolves were spotted in several locations in 2011. The different lone wolves are probably from the French or Italian populations. Since wildlife corridors and wildlife crossings over highways are being created that connect wildlife areas in the Netherlands, such as the Veluwezoom National Park and the Oostvaardersplassen with the Klever Reichswald in Germany, nature conservation organisations expect wolves to migrate to the low countries in the near future. In 2018, a wolf was recorded in Flanders, Belgium for the first time in over a century. The wolf's radio collar showed that it had come from Germany through the Netherlands, and that it had covered 500 km in just 10 days.Wolf found in northern Belgium, first time in over 100 years Switzerland's one wolf pack is in the Calanda mountain and there are several lone wolves. Wolves are afforded protection, and livestock damage compensation is paid by Cantons. Swiss authorities gave permission to shoot eight wolves between the years 2000 and 2013. Norway's wolf population is located in the south-east, close to the Swedish border, and consists of around 68 wolves.Svensson, Linn. et al. (2013).

The population is protected and compensation is paid for livestock damage, however in 2016 Norway planned to kill more than two-thirds of its population, with as many as 47 at risk of being shot. In 2015 more than 11,000 hunters applied for licenses to kill 16 wolves.

Retrieved on 20020-10-20 In Denmark the last wolf was shot in 1813, but in 2009, 2010 and 2012 there was speculation that a wolf had crossed the border from Germany due to numerous observations, with the latest in Thy National Park. This was confirmed after an autopsy, which also concluded that the particular wolf had died from side effects of a cancerous tumor. It was the first confirmed wild wolf in Denmark for 199 years. In 2013, three different lone wolves were observed in Denmark. According to local biologists based on sound recordings, one pair had pups in 2013. Compensation is paid for livestock damage. In July 2017 an adult wolf with eight pups was filmed, making it the first time in more than 200 years that wolfpups were confirmed to have been born in Denmark. While the small Danish population originated from wolves that immigrated from Germany, DNA evidence has revealed that Danish-born wolves also have moved to Germany. In 2018, it was estimated that the total population of Greenland wolves was about 200, but with significant uncertainty due to their very remote range. They have been fully protected in Greenland since 1988. Finland was estimated in 2013 to have an almost stable population of 97‚Äì106 wolves. Wolves are legally hunted only in areas with high reindeer densities. Compensation for livestock losses are paid by the state and insurance companies. The population is connected to the large Russian wolf population. Poland has a population of approximately 2500 wolves and increasing. Since 1995, they have been a protected species, and compensation is paid for livestock losses. Estonia has a quite stable wolf population of around 200, down from around 500 in the middle of the 1990s. The official standpoint considers the optimal population to be 100‚Äì200.Keskkonnainfo: hunt At rough scale the distribution range includes the whole country. In 2007, new version of the law on nature conservation introduced compensation for livestock damage, paid by the state.

Liechtenstein has reported one wolf, possibly dispersing from Switzerland.First ever wolf visits Liechtenstein Lithuania has a population of 300-400http://www.am.lt/VI/index.php#a/6797 which are increasing in number. The species is not protected, and only insured livestock receives compensation. Belarus is home to a population of 1,500‚Äì2,000 wolves. With the exception of specimens in nature reserves, wolves in Belarus are largely unprotected. They are designated a game species, and bounties ranging between ‚Ç¨60 and ‚Ç¨70 are paid to hunters for each wolf killed. This is a considerable sum in a country where the average monthly wage is ‚Ç¨230. No compensation is paid for livestock losses. Ukraine has an unprotected, yet stable population of 2,000 wolves. Since May 2007, the killing of pregnant females and pups is banned. No compensation is paid for livestock losses. Many of the wolves live in the Zone of alienation north of Chernobyl, where they face few natural threats. This applies equally to the Belarusian part of the zone.http://www.whatson-kiev.com/index.php?go=News‚àà=view&id;=4806 Czech Republic has a stable and protected population of 20 wolves, though there are no livestock damage compensation programmes.

Slovenia has a stable population of c. 40‚Äì60 wolves. Since 1991, they have been a protected species, and compensation is paid for livestock losses. Croatia has a stable population of around 200 wolves. Since May 1995, they have been a protected species, and the willful killing of wolves can result in a fine equivalent to $6,000. However, according to Dr. Djuro Huber of the University of Zagreb, illegal wolf killings increased after the protection scheme began, resulting in the deaths of 40 wolves. Compensation is paid for livestock losses. Bosnia and Herzegovina is thought to have a population of 400 wolves, though they are decreasing in number and are afforded no legal protection.

Russian wolves have no legal protection and number 25,000‚Äì30,000, and are probably increasing in number in some regions, such as Koryak Okrug and Kalmykia. Some villages in Chechnya's Nadterechny district have been reporting increasing wolf numbers since the decrease of military activities.Wolves Go on Offensive in Chechnya, Ruslan Isayev, Prague Watchdog September 25, 2007 On the other hand, in more populated regions of Central and Southern Russia the number of wolves is very small. In some regions, bounties are paid for the destruction of wolves and dens. Wolves live in comparatively few numbers in the Sikhote-Alin region due to competition with increasing tiger numbers. This competitive exclusion of wolves by tigers has been used by Russian conservationists to convince hunters in the Far East to tolerate the big cats, as they limit ungulate populations less than wolves, and are effective in controlling the latter's numbers.Wildlife Science: Linking Ecological Theory and Management Applications, By Timothy E. Fulbright, David G. Hewitt, Contributor Timothy E. Fulbright, David G. Hewitt, Published by CRC Press, 2007, No livestock damage compensation is paid.  Asia  Turkey has population of about 7,000. There are some local extinctions especially in the western parts of Turkey and the wolf population is declining in Turkey as a whole. Historically, the wolf has officially been considered a pest species and so it was hunted throughout the year without any limits. It was only in 2003 that the wolf received the status of a game species. Although wolves in Turkey are not legally protected, the gained status of a game species means that wolves can only be hunted with a license using established quotas which are restricted to hunting seasons. No compensation is paid for livestock damage. Iran has a population of 1,500 wolves. As of 2015 the government pays for livestock killed by wolves. There is also a $3,000 fine for hunting wolves.

China's wolf population largely lives in areas where little human-influenced change has occurred - the Qinghai‚ÄìTibet Plateau, the Mongolia Plateau, and the northeast Plain. In 2003, an estimated 12,500 wolves were living in China. In 2015, wolves were listed as a vulnerable species in the Red List of China‚Äôs Vertebrates, with all hunting being banned for this legally protected animal.Canis lupus status=NT (Near Threatened) Mongolia has a stable population of 10,000‚Äì20,000 wolves, which are given no legal protection, nor is livestock damage compensation paid.

There are currently no recent or reliable estimates on wolf populations in Afghanistan, Nepal or Bhutan.  North America  A radio collared wolf in Yellowstone National Park Captive Mexican wolf at Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge, New Mexico Canada has over 60,000 wolves, which are legally considered a big game species, though they are afforded protection in 3% of Canada's territory. The Northwest Territories, Nunavut and Yukon have 5,000 wolves each, British Columbia has 8,500 wolves, Alberta 4,200, Saskatchewan 4,300, Manitoba 4,000-6,000, Ontario 9,000, Quebec 5,000 and Labrador 2,000. Canada currently has no livestock damage compensation programmes. In the fall of 2012, the government of British Columbia was considering a cull of the wolf population in some areas. In the winter of 2015 the government of British Columbia began undertaking a cull of up to 184 wolves in an effort to combat dwindling caribou populations in the South Selkirk Mountains and the South Peace region. The cull, like ones before it, is opposed by some environmental groups. On 12 March 2012, a Labrador wolf, mistakenly thought to be a coyote, was shot in Newfoundland. It was the first confirmed Labrador wolf in Newfoundland since ca. 1930. The United States as a whole has up to 18,000 wolves, about two thirds of which are in Alaska. They are increasing in number in all their ranges. Usually, however, wolves in the United States are mostly seen during the winter months in northern Minnesota, northern Wisconsin, Michigan's Upper Peninsula, and portions of Washington, Idaho, northern Oregon, northwest Wyoming, and Montana, as the majority of wolf populations migrate from Canada to the Northwestern states & some of the Midwestern and Great Lakes States during the winter months for the competition over eating bison, elk, white tailed deer and other large ungulates, disputed between other carnivores such as grizzly bear, cougar, and coyote. Wolf recovery has been so successful that the United States Fish & Wildlife Service removed the western gray wolf from the federal endangered species list on March 28, 2008. Due to the controversy over wolf shootings, a coalition of environmental groups sued the federal government to put the gray wolf back on the Endangered Species list. On July 18, 2008, a federal judge ruled in favor of renewed endangered species protection. Alaska has a stable population of 10,500-12,000 wolves, which are legally hunted from August to April (in deer-rich areas) as a big game species. Minnesota has a population of 4,100Gray Wolf Population in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan (excluding Isle Royale) from 1976‚Äì2008, US Fish and Wildlife Service wolves, which are legally protected, though they are occasionally culled for depredation control. Minnesota used to have control over its wolf population, but this was revoked by a federal appellate court on August 1, 2017, making wolf management the charge of the federal government. The court decided to retain the state's minimum population of 1,600 animals. It has been argued by state officials that management should remain in the hands of the state, allowing for the wolf to be removed from protected status, since the population has exceeded recovery goals for more than 25 years. Both Wisconsin and Michigan have healthy populations of 750 each. On December 19, 2014, all wolves in states of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota became protected again under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. The Northern Rocky Mountain states (Wyoming, Idaho and Montana) have an approximate population of 1,657 wolves in 282 packs (including 85 breeding pairs). Two gray wolves were captured in north-central Washington state in July 2008, one of which was a nursing female. This is the first evidence of reproducing wolves in the state since the 1930s. As of the end of 2014, Washington has at least 68 wolves in 16 packs with 5 breeding pairs.Gray Wolf Conservation and Management-Wolf Packs in Washington-Annual Report-Pack Statistics-(as of December 31, 2014) In northeast Oregon, also in July 2008, wolf howls were heard by biologists who identified at least 2 adults and 2 pups. This was the first confirmed breeding pair in Oregon. By December 2011, Oregon's gray wolf population had grown to 24. One of the Oregon gray wolves, known as OR-7, traveled more than to the Klamath Basin and crossed the border into California. Wolf OR-7 became the first wolf west of the Cascades in Oregon since the last bounty was claimed in 1947. Oregon's wolf population increased to 77 wolves in 15 packs with 8 breeding pairs as of the end of 2015. As a result, Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife proposed to delist wolves from their protected species list. On January 14, 2009, the United States Department of the Interior removed the Canadian gray wolf from the Endangered Species List in every American state except Wyoming. This move was blocked by lawsuits filed by conservation groups, but was successfully delisted on April 15, 2011 by the US Congress as part of a budget bill. On August 31, 2012, Governor Matt Mead of Wyoming announced that wolves were no longer on the endangered species list in the state of Wyoming; therefore, they no longer need special protections from the US Fish and Wildlife Service. The wolf population in Wyoming is then controlled by the state. But on September 23, 2014, wolves in Wyoming are again listed as nonessential experimental population under the Endangered Species Act. Overall, as of the end of 2014, the Northwestern United States, with the exception of Alaska, has an estimated population of 1,802 wolves. The wolf has been extirpated from Mexico since the 1970s when the U.S. and Mexican governments cooperated to capture all remaining wild Mexican wolves and initiate a captive-breeding program in an attempt to save the local subspecies. The Mexican Wolf was reintroduced into the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest in Arizona in 1998 as part of a captive breeding program. There are at least 42 wild Mexican wolves in the southwest United States in 2008. In 2014, there are around 83 Mexican wolves in the wild.http://www.fws.gov/southwest/es/mexicanwolf/index.cfm On October 27, 2014, a collared wolflike canid was seen in north of Grand Canyon, in November 2014, the same animal was videoed,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Su_NvK2Lfv8 it was confirmed to be a northwestern wolf from the Northern Rocky Mountains in November 21, 2014.http://www.fws.gov/southwest/es/mexicanwolf/pdf/Grand_Canyon_Canid_fNR.11-20-14.pdf On December 28, 2014, it was shot dead in southwestern Utah near the Arizona border.

The McHenry eventually discharges into the Jardine which continues north west combining with multiple other tributaries as it flows into the flatlands of the Jardine Swamps. It eventually discharges into Endeavour Strait near Van Spoult Head opposite Prince of Wales Island and into the northern waters of the Gulf of Carpentaria, part of the Coral Sea. Unlike other tropical rivers in Northern Australia, the Jardine flows all year round as the catchment receives sufficient rainfall throughout the year for it to do so. The river catchment occupies an area of of mostly uninhabited country, some of the catchment is made up of mostly freshwater wetlands. The river has a mean annual discharge of . Fauna A total of 46 species of fish are found in the river including; Sailfin Glassfish, Macleay's Glassfish, Barred Grunter, Marbled Eel, Hardyhead, Pennyfish, Mouth Almighty, Goby, Empire Gudgeon, Barramundi, Oxeye Herring, Northern Trout Gudgeon, Seven-spot Archerfish and Banded Rainbowfish. The Jardine River Painted turtle, previously thought to have been extinct after not being sighted in the river for 20 years, was discovered in the Jardine again in 2014. A team of Apudthama Cape York rangers and scientists from Origin Energy have trapped 24 of the turtles at two different locations using new trapping methods. History The traditional owners of the area are the Unjadi and Ankamuti peoples who have lived in the area for thousands of years. The river is named after the explorers and pioneers; Frank Jardine and Alexander Jardine. The men came across the river as part of their 1864 expedition through Far North Queensland. In early 1865 the Jardines had just survived a pitched battle with the local Indigenous Australians and had some horses drown while crossing the Batavia River. The party was low on ammunition and food when they came across a stream they thought was an escape but wasn't; they named it Deception River.

Jun 2006) David (b. 24 October 1940), later David Sainsbury, Baron Sainsbury of Turville. Business career In 1930, he joined the family grocery business founded by his grandfather, and became joint president almost 40 years later. Robert Sainsbury was an advocate of better conditions for the retail chain's employees. Pensions and sickness benefits for all staff came in 1935; overtime payments were introduced in 1941; and, from 1962, the five-day week was standard. Eight years after he joined the family firm, his father, John Benjamin Sainsbury, retired due to ill-health, and Robert Sainsbury and his elder brother Alan Sainsbury became joint general managers. While Alan Sainsbury took charge of trading matters, Robert Sainsbury specialised in administration, finance and personnel. It was a happy partnership, lasting more than 30 years. The Second World War broke out a year after Robert Sainsbury's promotion, and there were rationed supplies at the 250 Sainsbury's shops. Robert Sainsbury was a strong supporter of the Beveridge Report, which cradled the welfare state into being. By the end of the war, Robert Sainsbury had cut the long hours which under-18s had necessarily put in - with men conscripted and women on war work. The 1950s brought self-service supermarkets. Over the period of his joint general management, deputy chairpersonship and chairpersonship (he became deputy chairperson when his father died in 1956, and succeeded his brother as chairperson in 1967), the company's turnover increased from ¬£45m to ¬£166m, and the number of employees rose fourfold. By the time he retired as chairperson in 1969, Robert Sainsbury had been a principal architect of the supergrocer's fortunes, which ensured its continuing success through to the beginning of the 1990s. Charitable works Robert Sainsbury was as an art collector and benefactor who gave his collection to the University of East Anglia, and was awarded a knighthood in 1969 for services to the arts. In 1973, Robert Sainsbury made a gift to the University of East Anglia of several hundred paintings, drawings and sculptures from around the world, which he had bought over the decades. Designed by the architect Norman Foster, and with an endowment of ¬£3m from Sainsbury's son David, the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts, built to house the works, opened in spring 1978.

It wasn't until 1996 however, that Le Duch√© de Bicolline and the first official \\"Grande Bataille\\" took place and was formed. It is often labeled as a live action role-playing game (LARP) due to the large percentage of players who participate in role-playing. Events take place at a dedicated venue covering 140 hectares and two medieval villages. Le Duch√© de Bicolline is located in Saint-Mathieu-du-Parc near Shawinigan, QC. Venue The most passionate players involved over the years have built two medieval villages with roads, bridges, ditches, houses and inns at the Duch√© de Bicolline venue. Construction days are scheduled throughout spring and summer for those building new houses. These houses are built to resemble medieval buildings and to be as decorum as possible. Players are responsible for their own buildings and must follow standards of construction. With two villages that are composed of one hundred and ninety buildings, and more being added each year, Bicolline is making itself out to be one of the largest immersion medieval venues in the world. The demand for construction on the site is so great that the owner of Bicolline spends all year controlling applications, validating the plans for buildings, ensuring that projects are feasible, and so on. Setting The world of Mundis has its own geography, economy, conflicts, and complex geopolitics that have been evolving since its inception in response to the actions of the players and the outcomes of battles and events. The geopolitical system is based on feudal Europe, and is the basis for most of the actions undertaken on the ground during the events. The complexity of the setting is such that it is almost impossible for an individual to control more than one area of competition such as commercial, political, military, or religious. Generally, guilds specialize and focus on one or two aspects of the game. The guilds have diverse experts among their members, each able to follow the changes and fully understand one aspect of the world of Bicolline. The political arena consists of fiefdoms and provinces that form the kingdom. All levels of politics can be filled by players, making the world very dynamic. Accession to titles of nobility follows a democratic system. This modern aspect helps to make the experience accessible to all. It is possible to create internal conflicts and external playing with virtual units. These virtual wars can be realized in a fight during real scenarios on the ground. The commercial aspect of the game is constantly changing, following an in-game market. Goods are transacted at extremely variable prices depending on their availability and the stability of the kingdom. All the goods in the Bicolline world are in the form of cards. These cards have a certain worth depending on the days market and are often traded among players in order to fortify their guild or to complete certain tasks. There is also the population cards that each member of Bicolline receives upon entry. These are seen as one of the most precious cards in the game available for a commoner, as each guild must accumulate a certain number of cards in order to stay in existence. Military units for the geopolitical war game are represented by cards too, some can be worth up to ten population cards. Many players try to exchange and gather as many population cards as they can in order to help their guild, and are also some of the most expensive cards on the market. Bicolline also mints its own coins, called the Solar, that are another currency of transaction. Guilds The basic unit of organisation both in-game and out-of-game is the guild. Guilds are voluntary groupings of players promoting an event, a race or a common goal. Typically a guild has about thirty members. There are sometimes clans without guilds and fewer members which will usually eventually form a registered guild. Each guild or clan has a chief that guides the rest of their members of the on-goings in the Bicolline world. The guild structure allows efficient distribution of information and gives players a weight in the game beyond what they can achieve as individual characters. There are currently 181 recorded guilds and clans. The majority of the guild can be divided into broad categories: military, commercial, political, religious, criminal, and magical. Each is affiliated with one or more kingdoms in the world of Bicolline: Empire, Andorra, Arganne, Ozame, Nasgaroth, Garganesh, Irendill, Taluskan, Sands-City, the South Lands, Berkwald, and the Independent Cities wherein each has a King. Each guild also follows a religion, each with its own God to whom they pray to and can have a major influence on their game. A guild also possess an emblem and distinctive colors. This helps identify players during a battle. Some guilds are more strict regarding wearing the group attire. Not wearing the guild colors might create confusion on the battlefield and get your character killed as it is safer for your side to kill you instead of taking the chance that you might actually be an enemy. Therefore, wearing the guild color can have positive or negative impact on your playing depending on the strategy employed. Guild size can range from less than ten players to a few hundred.  Economy  The economic system is played by acquiring resources which are represented with cards. Usually resources are owned by and traded between guilds. These resources are then turned in to the game system to build, upkeep, or upgrade virtual game resources. One card can represent either a single resource (one sheep) or a lot of resources (20 sheep). The game system prints and releases these cards in batches as rewards for quests, campaigns, tavern nights, special events, adventures, and the Grand Battle. Individual players may also be awarded economic cards for fair play witnessed by marshals during combat. Guilds and individual players within the game have created and run markets which buy and sell resource cards, similar to medieval market towns, most of which can be found in Old Town. Most players don't participate in the games economic level of play as effective use of the cards requires land in the virtual game. System Unlike some LARPs, Bicolline does not have a character creation system. However, every participant must dress in accordance to the period. Many players create elaborate characters with costumes, accessories and even face paint. The players can portray any kind of character that they are able to dress as; for example, one guild dresses Japanese while, another dresses as blue people, as some guilds consist of all the members portraying a certain character. A select few characters can apprentice under one of the rare master alchemists and sorcerers to give their guild bonuses between events; usually these are only possible after attending several events. Much of the roleplaying in the game of Bicolline happens in the \\"virtual world\\" between events, where armies move, economies produce income, and sorcerers cast spells. The \\"virtual world\\" is seen as the most important aspect of the entire game and world of Bicolline. It is in the \\"virtual world\\" that most of the action and decisions take place. Not every person who attends Bicolline participates in the virtual game, but those who are actively involved contribute to the \\"virtual world\\" and the actions and decisions made influence their game as well as the game of others.  Combat Rules  The simplified rules of combat are handed to each participant, as a card, during registration. English and French versions are available. This simplified rules set was published in 2017 by Duche du Bicolline. = Fair Play = * The marshals wearing blue and yellow tabards have authority on the battlefield. They are the ones to contact in case of an accident. * All participants, weapons, shields, monsters, war machines, and in -game items or objects must be homologated before entering the battlefield. * Each individual is responsible for counting the hits they themselves receive and not the ones they give. * It is forbidden to voluntarily betray the side you swore allegiance to. = Hit Areas = * The body is divided into six (6) hit areas that have 1 hit point (HP) each: each arm, each leg, the trunk and the head (includes the neck). * The eyes, nose, mouth and genitals can't be targeted. = Weapons and Combat = * All hits deal 1 damage point (DP) and must be delivered using a weapon. It is the hit itself that counts and not the force with which it is dealt. * All weapons of 112 cm or more must be held with two hands and spears must have a mark 50 cm from the pommel, delimiting a zone where you are limited to the presence of a single hand. * it is forbidden to thrust or aim projectiles at an opponents head, to use excessive force or to hit someone with a shield. = Death and Injuries = * A hit area becomes useless and inoperable when it is reduced to 0 HP's. If the head or the trunk are reduced to 0 HP's, the participant automatically dies and must act as such. * It is forbidden to fake death. = Armor = * You are allowed to carry one indestructible shield. * Pieces of armor protect the wearer by adding non cumulative armor points (AP) and only the specific area that is covered by the armor is protected. A hit area can never lost more AP's than the value of its highest type of protection. ** +2 AP: Armor made of overlapping metal plates. ** +1 AP: Armor made of flexible or rigid armor. ** +0 AP: All other accessories or clothing. = Monsters and War Machines = * Monsters have 10 HP's distributed over their body and are immune to projectiles. * War machines can be destroyed by removing their red flag. * A monster's weapon and moving projectiles from war machines kill instantaneously (one-shot kill). This included hits delivered to all six hit areas, the shield or any piece of clothing or equipment. Please note that all physical contact and violent or disregardful behavior are strictly forbidden. Activities Players taking part in the Great Battle of Bicolline in 2005 As many as 2000 players each year attend the main event The Great Battle of Bicolline. Dozens of volunteers and a core group of employees work all year to create one of the world's largest and most decorum-rich LARP settings. In addition to the Great Battle various events are held throughout the year including the Bal Pourpre (approximately 1000 people in March), tavern evenings (100 people about 7-8 times per year) and campaigns and battle scenarios of all kinds that usually attract several hundred people. The Great Battle of Bicolline Every year since 1996 a large LARP has been organised at the venue. The Great Battle of Bicolline brings together around 4000 LARPers and medieval reenactors over seven days, and culminates in a huge battle. The battle is prepared for throughout the year with skirmishes and diplomacy between the various groups that attend. Everyone in attendance must dress up medieval at all times, and all modern items, such as cellphones are put away and unused. All participants submerge themselves into the world of Bicolline, getting into their roles and characters and the real world is left behind. Every detail, all the way down to the utensils used must be decorum in order to create the medieval atmosphere. The large grounds are filled with many houses as well as medieval tents. There are also some designated areas where those with regular camping tents may be placed in order to minimize the viewing of modern items. Throughout the week there are several events and activities; each night there is a musical spectacle as well as a show, there are competitions and small battles which lead up to the Great Battle, as well as activities and small battles for the children. The Great Battle takes place on the last day of the week (Saturday) and normally endures between 3 and 4 hours long. Each year there is a new scenario based on the events and occurrences throughout the year in the \\"virtual world.\\" There are specific rules in place in order to assure safety. The age limit in order to participate in the Battle is sixteen. Upon entry into the ground, each person is given a colored bracelet according to age. Those who are under sixteen upon registration must wear a child bracelet. Those who are sixteen and older wear a different colored bracelet, ensuring that those who aren't of age are mistaken to be over sixteen. Weapons are also checked by the workers of Bicolline and are marked in order to ensure the safety of players and ensure that no unsafe weapon is used during the battle. Weapons such as swords and daggers are normally made out of foam and arrows are tipped with large amounts of foam and tape in order to avoid serious injury. There are even vendors that make and sell weapons that have already been checked and approved by Bicolline. Most participants also wear armors in leather or metal which allow for protection throughout the battle. With armor worn, a point system applies and it then takes a certain number of \\"touches\\" by a weapon in order to be considered injured or dead, depending on placement of armor and where the weapon has touched the body.  Bal Pourpre  The \\"Bal Pourpre\\" is the second most popular event in the Bicolline world. With many of the members of Bicolline attending the event, it is a night to reunite with allies and guild members to discuss upcoming events, as well as plans of next moves. With a masquerade theme, everyone in attendance must wear a mask and are encouraged to dress their best, but still medieval in design and style. Trollball A game of Trollball Trollball is a sport played in Bicolline and other LARP settings. It is played in Europe and Canada, with many teams competing. Trollball was started by Jose Antonio Ouellette in 1995. The goal of the game is to put the troll head in a well without being hit by the foam weapons of the opposing team's attackers. Each player has a clearly defined position within their team such as Troller, Healer, Attacker or Reserve. Strategy, group cohesiveness and solid fighting skills are major assets in this sport. This is the official sport of Bicolline and there is a large tournament each year at the \\"Grande Bataille.\\" Almost every guild has at least one team that compete in the tournament throughout the week until there is a winner. Tournaments A variety of tournaments are held during the week of Bicolline. These range from chess (with an expensive entry fee) to gladiators (where pairs of armorless fighters face off), strongman (speed and strength), and archery (including a one-on-one combat). Each participant and winner of these tournaments receive a prize. Whether these be cards or solars, many guild leaders encourage their members to participate in the tournaments as a way to contribute to the guild and help build their kingdom.  Adventures  Bicolline has begun to run events which are focused more closely on the story of a location in the game world. The scope of the Adventures tends to be focused on interpersonal narrative, rather than guild interaction. Each year the administration runs one plot line three times in different months. La Confr√©rie de l'Hippocampe was held in 2018. These events are run in a style similar to other larps in the region. Players meet with the Event Holder, to be given basic plot, honorary titles, or possibly additional coins, before venturing forth into the game world. The game is live for approximately 2 days, and New Auberge acts as an Inn or tavern familiar to players of table top RPGs. Quests Many guilds organize weeklong quests for other players. There is usually some reward for being the first to complete the quest. These quests require extensive travel and searching, but do allow for interactions between other players and can even help in making new alliances. The information and rewards gathered throughout the quests are just another way to help the players guilds and to fortify their stocks and supplies, which in return affects some outcomes in the \\"virtual world\\" as well as the \\"Grande Bataille.\\" References External links *Bicolline Live-action role-playing games Role-playing games introduced in 1996 Mauricie 1994 establishments in Quebec ","title":"Bicolline"},{"id":"19216289","text":"Theddingworth is a village and civil parish in Leicestershire, England.

In English, they are usually called the hand form or just the form; in Mandarin it is usually called ch'uan (). They are performed slowly by beginners and are said to promote concentration, condition the body and acquaint students with the inventory of motion techniques for more advanced styles of martial arts training. There are also solo weapons forms, as well as much shorter and repetitive sequences to train power generation leverages as a form of qigong (ch'i kung). The various forms of Wu-style pushing hands have two person drill routines as well, which fulfil some of the same functions as the power generation drills. In 1914 Xi Yui-seng established the Athletic Research Institute in Beijing and Invited Yang Shao-hou, Yang Chengfu and Wu Chien- ch'uan to teach. From then on T'ai Chi was taught to the public changing the ancient closed door policy where T'ai Chi was only taught privately to very close and well known people within a limited circle known as the tutor disciple relationship. Grand Master Wu Chien-ch'uan revised and enriched the art of t'ai chi ch'uan handed down from his father Wu Ch'uan-yu. His development of the slow set led to the creation of the style of t'ai chi today known as Wu-style t'ai chi ch'uan . He omitted some of the repetitions, Fa- jing, stamping and jumping movements to make the form smoother, more structured with continuous steady movements. This form promoted the health aspects of Tai Chi and was more suitable for general practitioners though it still contained all the martial applications and training. Yang Chengfu of Yang-style t'ai chi ch'uan also modified his own Yang style in a similar way at the same time. His brother, Yang Shou-hao's form had a high frame with lively steps alternating between fast and slow movements with hard and crisp Fa-jing. Chen Pan-ling, who was a student of Yang Shao-hao and Wu Chien-chuan describes T'ai Chi form practice beginning with slow movement changing to fast and returning to slow movement. He also points out learning to exercise rapid movement in the form and training from soft to hard and hard to soft movements. The Shanghai Wu-style Fast Form kept the original Fa-jing ÁôºÂãÅ (release of power), jumping, attacking and stamping movements to be studied by those eager to advance their T'ai Chi practice. This advanced form was not yet taught openly. In December 1982 there was a martial arts meeting held in Beijing to foster the traditional martial arts of China. Wu Ying-hua and Ma Yueh-liang of The Shanghai Jianquan Taijiquan Association contributed to this effort by disclosing the original Wu-style Fast Set for the first time to the public. In 1983 their adopted daughter Shi Mei Lin demonstrated the Wu-style T'ai Chi Fast Form at the All China Traditional Martial Arts competition in Nanchang where she received the Award of Excellence. Other Wu-style fast forms The Wu family's Hong Kong branch also teaches a somewhat different fast form. Shanghai Wu-style fast form list The following list is an English translation from Chinese of the empty hand or fist form list published in Ma Yueliang's, Wu Yinghua's and Shi Mei Lin's Wu-style T'ai chi Fast Form'. (Note: Traditionally this set consists of 108 forms. For transcribing purposes some of the repeated forms are given one reference number in both the Chinese and English versions of the Wu-style Fast Form book.)

Jabel Mukaber (, , lit. Big Mountain) is a predominantly Palestinian neighborhood in southern East Jerusalem. It is bordered by East Talpiot to the west, Abu Tor and Silwan to the north and Sur Baher to the south. Jabel Mukaber has a population of approximately 30,000 (2017).  History  According to local legend, Jabel Mukaber is named after Umar ibn al-Khattab, a disciple of Muhammad and the second caliph of the Islamic Caliphate, who cried Allahu Akbar at this site. It was substantially settled by members of the Bedouin Sawarha tribe at the turn of the 20th century.Amir Cheshin,Bill Hutman,Avi Melamed, Separate and Unequal, Harvard University Press 2009 p.201. During the Mandatory Palestine, the offices of the British High Commissioner, the representative of British imperial rule in Mandatory Palestine were located on the ridge of Jabel Mukaber (known as the Hill of Evil CounselMotti Golani, The End of the British Mandate for Palestine, 1948: The Diary of Sir Henry Gurney, Springer 2009 p.44, n.78. in medieval Christian tradition, which identified it as the residence of Caiaphas where Judas plotted to kill Jesus).Charles Warren, Claude Reignier Conder, The Survey of Western Palestine: Jerusalem, Committee of the Palestine Exploration Fund1884 p.397 During the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood battled Jewish forces in the area. ªUwaysƒ´,  ªAbd al-FattƒÅ·∏• Mu·∏•ammad. (1998). The Muslim Brothers and the Palestine Question 1928-1947 I. B. Tauris, p.209. . Jabel Mukaber and other Arab villages in East Jerusalem came under Jordanian control, with the division of the city formalized in the Armistice Agreement of 3 April 1949. Jordan subsequently unilaterally annexed the West Bank, a move that was largely unrecognized internationally.P R Kumaraswamy, Historical Dictionary of the Arab-Israeli Conflict, Rowman & Littlefield 2015 p.161.  Post-1967  After the 1967 Six-Day War, Jabel Mukaber has been under Israeli occupation. Israel unilaterally placed six of the Jabel Mukaber's seven neighbouring villages under the jurisdiction of the Jerusalem Municipality,A good friend jumps the fence, Tom Segev, Sep.01, 2005, Haaretz The exception was ash-Sheikh Sa'd, which was detached from Jaber Mukaber, though the two villages were locally considered to be one place, and excluded from Israel's incorporation of the area with its provision that the villagers would be treated as permanent residents of Israel.Ren√© Backmann, A Wall in Palestine, Picador 2010 p.123. According to ARIJ, Israel has confiscated the following areas of land from Jabel Mukaber in order to construct Israeli settlements: * 544 dunams for East Talpiot, * 140 dunams for Nof Zion.Jabal al Mukabbir & As Sawahira al Gharbiya Town Profile, p. 15  Demography  Many residents of Jabel Mukaber rejected Israeli citizenship to demonstrate their solidarity with Palestinians in the West Bank, but they are considered permanent residents. As holders of blue identity cards, they have wide freedom of movement within Israel, and have access to health care, unemployment and other benefits. The construction of the Israeli West Bank barrier has divided Jabel Mukaber in half and left some neighborhood residents on the West Bank side of the wall, meaning that they hold Palestinian IDs rather than Israeli IDs, and cannot cross into Israel itself. Running through the centre of the neighbourhood, the barrier often separates members of the same family from one another, disrupting normal family life. Jabel Mukaber is under-budgeted for municipal services, leading to sewage blockages in parts of the neighborhood and a shortage of classrooms.  Arab-Israeli conflict  East Talpiot was established in 1970 in close proximity to Jabel Mukaber during the upswing of building that followed the Six-Day War. When the Second Intifada (uprising) began, the mood changed. Since then, Jabel Mukaber has been the scene of numerous demonstrations, protests and riots in support of the Palestinian cause. The Jerusalem Municipality began to draw up a zoning plan for Jabel Mukhaber in 1980. It was finally approved 16 years later, in 1996. The plan designated 70% of Jabel Mukhaber land as a green zone. The land set aside for housing construction was 20.5%, though most of it had already been used to that end. The housing density for the Arab area was set at 25%, in contrast to the 140% housing density level allowed for construction in the adjacent Jewish suburbs of East Jerusalem.Menachem Klein, Jerusalem: The Contested City, C. Hurst & Co. 2001 p.30. Oded Shalom, writing in 2017, states that Jabel Mukaber is > 'A depressing slum with garbage spilling over from dumpsters all over the > streets, with no playgrounds and no green areas, with a shortage of > classrooms and kindergartens, with one high school for boys which was opened > only two years ago after 20-year pleadings from the residents. They pay > taxes to the state and property tax to the municipality, but don‚Äôt seem to > be getting anything visible in return. .'Oded Shalom,'How Jabel Mukaber > became a terror incubator,' Ynet 19 January 2017.  Landmarks  A Tolerance Monument sculpted by Czes≈Çaw D≈∫wigaj in collaboration with Michal Kubiak is situated on a hill marking the divide between Jewish East Talpiot and Arab Jabel Mukaber, standing opposite the United Nations headquarters in Jerusalem in a park near Goldman Promenade. Unveiled in Jerusalem in 2008, it was funded by Polish businessman Aleksander Gudzowaty as a symbol to promote peace in the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict.

KVINFO is an abbreviation of the Danish words k√∏n, viden, information, and forskning, meaning gender, knowledge, information, and research. KVINFO's core resource is a library of more than 20,000 books, journals and political publications dealing with equal opportunities and women's issues. This library may be seen as an example of a broader, more holistic concept of a library because it actually carries out important functions related to modern information centers. For example, it edits a web magazine, an online Biographical Encyclopedia of Danish Women, a database of women professionals, and web stories on key periods in the history of Danish women. Furthermore, it coordinates special programs such as the mentor-network for women of all ethnic backgrounds living in Denmark, and the women's professional dialogues on human rights and equal opportunities in the Middle East.  History  KVINFO's history goes back to 1964 when the founder Nynne Koch, who at the time worked at the Royal Danish Library in Copenhagen as a secretary, initiated a women's documentation service. She was allocated 15 minutes a day in which to register incoming books on women's issues in a card catalogue. Such initiative allowed KVINFO to develop a unique classification and subject indexing system invented by Koch and developed over the years by special librarians. The system takes into account the particular needs of researchers specialized in women and gender studies in a way that posts in the catalogue are enriched with key words giving each post as many search entrances as possible. By 1982, KVINFO was established as a four-year experiment funded by the Danish Ministry of Culture. Koch and her staff of volunteers moved to a new venue and expanded their activities. In 1987 the center became a self-governing institution. Elisabeth M√∏ller Jensen was the director of KVINFO from 1990 to 2014. During her directorship KVINFO's budget and staff increased threefold. The center's magazine has been redesigned and relaunched so that its circulation doubled. The organization's database project, the first online database of women experts in Europe, was also made available in the Internet. Nina Groes took over the position of director on February 1, 2014. Furthermore, the center has implemented information technology on all levels and functions as coordinator for the Danish Ministry of Culture's Cultural Network Denmark project.  Documentation and information services  Although KVINFO has its roots in the Danish library sector, it has also contributed to bringing women's politics and women's research into the forefront of cultural debate in Scandinavia for the past eighteen years. In addition to collecting and registering publications on women's studies, gender studies, men's studies, queer studies, gender equality, valid statistics, biographies, autobiographies, and so forth, KVINFO communicates with national and international audiences via several information services.  A web magazine for gender and culture  KVINFO's magazine, Forum, first paper edition appeared in 1982 and for the next ten years was the only Danish women's studies journal. In 1998 it became a web magazine in order to reach new groups of readers and place gender on their agenda. Forum's main purpose is to increase the visibility of Danish women and of gender issues and to create links and contact to other women and gender researchers globally. It is mainly published in Danish.  A Biographical Encyclopedia of Danish women  Launched in 2003 under the Danish name Dansk kvindebiografisk leksikon, this encyclopaedia contains approximately 2,000 Danish women all pioneers within their fields such as education, nursing, science, music, etc., or central figures within the suffrage movement, politics, women's organizations, research, and business among others. This material is available to the general public free of charge on the Internet.  A database of Women Online  In 1995, KVINFO set up a database of women experts in Denmark called Women Online. This database provides easy access to biographical information on a large number of contemporary women who are opinion leaders, senior managers, politicians, researchers and experts within a wide range of subjects. It provides a broad selection of candidates for appointments in private and public office, for committees, tribunals, commissions and councils, and offers names for speakers, teachers, facilitators and consultants.  A website on Women's history  KVINFO launched this website in November 2001 and the idea behind it is to tell the story of Danish women's road to equal opportunities from 1850 to 1920. Documents on important landmarks such as the suffrage, women's access to education and employment, women's fight for independence and the debate on sexual morality are available in Danish in the Internet.  Other activities  KVINFO is involved in many other projects. Besides arranging a wide range of lectures, seminars and cultural events, the center has strengthen its services coordinating programs supporting women's right in the Middle East and providing opportunities for immigrant women in Denmark.  Mentor network program for women immigrants In 2001 the Danish women's movement in general, and KVINFO in particular, were criticized for letting down immigrant women. By 2003 a mentor network was set up for the benefit of refugee and immigrant women living in Denmark. The idea was to match KVINFO's rich networks of strong, committed, well educated women with refugee and immigrant women. Through one-on-one meetings of equals, women-mentors provide access to their professional networks and give appropriate advice regarding job applications, job interviews, workplace culture and reassessment of employment potential. It has been estimated that more than 50 percent of all job openings in Denmark are filled via personal networks. Networks are essential to gain a foothold in Danish society. Women immigrants are matched with Danish mentors based on the educational background, profession and personal wishes. By 2013, more than 3,300 women participants were already part of KVINFO's network, which is organized in four branches and in four different Danish cities. Women in Dialogue in the Middle East Created in 2006, KVINFO's Middle East initiative is the result of a desire to create a bridging frame to the bilateral partnership between Denmark and different Arab countries that currently focus on promoting gender equality and women's rights. The program works by supporting proposals for capacity building of civil society organisations, especially women's organizations, in four strategic areas: legal change, women's participation in the public sphere, domestic violence, and research, documentation and information on gender related issues In its initial phase KVINFO's initiative includes Morocco, Egypt, Palestine, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen.

Franz Joseph, Ritter von Buss (23 March 1803, Zell am Harmersbach ‚Äì 31 January 1878, Freiburg im Breisgau) was a German Roman Catholic jurist, activist and politician. Life He studied at the University of Freiburg where he took the doctor's degree in philosophy, law, and medicine. After a short stay at the Universities of Bonn and G√∂ttingen he returned to Freiburg, passed his examination and was appointed attorney for that city. He became ordinary professor at the university in 1836, and obtained a following among the students, because he treated vexed social and ecclesiastical problems. To meet his many opponents Buss often lectured four, even five, times a day. Besides a modern language club of which he was the founder and president, he gave much of his time to creating at Freiburg a centre for the comparative study of European legislation and jurisprudence. He soon found, however, that the means of international correspondence were inadequate to the enterprise. Some of the material collected appeared in book form (1835‚Äì46), the sole fruit of the scheme. In 1837 Buss was elected to the Lower House of the Grand Duchy of Baden, and addressed himself at once to such subjects as the social question, the liberty of the Catholic Church, a uniform customs system, and closer commercial union between the States of Germany. Buss met from the beginning a hostile majority, and he was reproached in open Parliament with errors and false steps of his youth. Unable to make the least impression, he resigned his seat. Elected again in 1846, Buss opposed the \\"Deutschkatholicismus\\" of Ronge. This brought out his opponents in full force. Extensive petitions in his favor compelled the Government to dissolve the Parliament, but the new election brought no improvement. Buss was the only champion of the Catholic Church in the Lower House, whilst in the Upper House the weight of the opposition fell on Baron von Andlau and his colleague Hirscher. He introduced the Sisters of Charity into Baden; transformed his own house into an ecclesiastical college; during the famine of the winter of 1846 he fed thousands of starving people in the Black Forest; and he organized the Catholics politically and formed them into societies. In 1848 Buss presided over the first general assembly of the German Catholic associations (Katholikentag) in Mainz. He represented Ahaus-Steinfurt in the German Parliament at Frankfurt. There, as in the Erfurt Union Parliament, where he was the leader of the Greater-Germany Party, he favoured Austria as against Prussia. When opposition to the Catholic Church in Baden developed into open hostility, Buss was at the side of the archbishop, Hermann von Vicari. He was elected for the third time to the Baden Landtag when the Concordat between Baden and the Holy See was in jeopardy. He at once organized a popular deputation to the sovereign, comprising representatives from all the parishes of Baden. But the old opposition prevented the demonstration, invalidated his election, and ejected him from the Landtag, and finally, at the next election, his constituents forsook him. Buss, now, more than ever, turned his face toward Austria. During the Austro-Italian War he was active at the head of an association for the relief of the German prisoners; in acknowledgment of his services the emperor conferred on him the Order of the Iron Crown. He also organized at Vienna a great manifestation in favor of the temporal power of the pope, for which he was decorated by Pope Pius IX with the Order of Gregory the Great. Under the strain of work and disappointments, Buss broke down completely in 1866. He recovered, but events had meanwhile advanced rapidly and his hopes for the hegemony of Austria were blasted. He remained averse to the new German Empire. Elected a fourth time to the Lower House of Baden, Buss maintained his former reputation. In 1874 he was sent to the Reichstag by a very large vote and took his seat with the Centre Party. In 1877, after the death of his youngest child, he withdrew from public life and died soon after. Works The \\"Methodology of Canon Law\\" (1842), the \\"Influence of Christianity on Law and State\\" (1844), the \\"Difference between Catholic and Protestant Universities in Germany\\" (1846), the \\"German Union and the Love of Prussia\\", the \\"Re-establishment of Canon Law\\", and the \\"Defence of the Jesuits\\" (1853) appeared in rapid succession, each to do the work of the hour. The 1855 \\"Life of St. Thomas of Canterbury\\" was dedicated it to Archbishop Vicari. His Winfrid-Bonifacius was published posthumously, in 1880, by Rudolf von Scherer.

Public life When in 1927 his father was sent into exile, he used the opportunity to deepen his medical knowledge in France and Germany. At the University of Chile, he became successively Professor of Clinical Medicine (1932), of Medical Semiology (1937), and Full Professor and Chair of Medicine (1944). At the Hospital del Salvador in Santiago, he organized a Clinical Department exemplary for its discipline, academic environment and dedication to patients and students. He was one of the prime movers for the reform of medical teaching in 1943, created the medical residency programs for the training of specialists in 1952, served as Dean of the Faculty of Medicine from 1958 to 1962, and was a founding member of the Chilean Academy of Medicine (1964).

M. Rassias, World Scientific: 1989, 49‚Äì64. Principles The field of asymptotics is normally first encountered in school geometry with the introduction of the asymptote, a line to which a curve tends at infinity. The word ŒëœÉœçŒºœÄœÑœâœÑŒøœÇ (asymptotos) in Greek means non-coincident and puts strong emphasis on the point that approximation does not turn into coincidence. It is a salient feature of asymptotics, but this property alone does not entirely cover the idea of asymptotics and, etymologically, the term seems to be quite insufficient. Perturbation theory, small and large parameters In physics and other fields of science, one frequently comes across problems of an asymptotic nature, such as damping, orbiting, stabilization of a perturbed motion, etc. Their solutions lend themselves to asymptotic analysis (perturbation theory), which is widely used in modern applied mathematics, mechanics and physics. But asymptotic methods put a claim on being more than a part of classical mathematics. K. Friedrichs said: ‚ÄúAsymptotic description is not only a convenient tool in the mathematical analysis of nature, it has some more fundamental significance‚Äù. M. Kruskal introduced the special term asymptotology, defined above, and called for a formalization of the accumulated experience to convert the art of asymptotology to a science. A general term is capable of possessing significant heuristic value. In his essay \\"The Future of Mathematics\\",The Future of Mathematics H. Poincar√© wrote the following. In addition, ‚Äúthe success of ‚Äòcybernetics‚Äô, ‚Äòattractors‚Äô and ‚Äòcatastrophe theory‚Äô illustrates the fruitfulness of word creation as scientific research‚Äù.Arnol‚Äôd, V.I. (1994), \\"Basic concepts\\", Dynamical Systems V (editor--Arnol‚Äôd, V.I.), Springer, 207-215 Almost every physical theory, formulated in the most general manner, is rather difficult from a mathematical point of view. Therefore, both at the genesis of the theory and its further development, the simplest limiting cases, which allow analytical solutions, are of particular importance. In those limits, the number of equations usually decreases, their order reduces, nonlinear equations can be replaced by linear ones, the initial system becomes averaged in a certain sense, and so on. All these idealizations, different as they may seem, increase the degree of symmetry of the mathematical model of the phenomenon under consideration. Asymptotic approach In essence, the asymptotic approach to a complex problem consists in treating the insufficiently symmetrical governing system as close to a certain symmetrical one as possible. In attempting to obtain a better approximation of the exact solution to the given problem, it is crucial that the determination of corrective solutions, which depart from the limit case, be much simpler than directly investigating the governing system. At first sight, the possibilities of such an approach seem restricted to varying the parameters determining the system only within a narrow range. However, experience in the investigation of different physical problems shows that if the system's parameters have changed sufficiently and the system has deviated far from the symmetrical limit case, another limit system, often with less obvious symmetries can be found, to which an asymptotic analysis is also applicable. This allows one to describe the system's behavior on the basis of a small number of limit cases over the whole range of parameter variations. Such an approach corresponds to the maximum level of intuition, promotes further insights, and eventually leads to the formulation of new physical concepts. It is also important that asymptotic analysis helps to establish the connection between different physical theories. The aim of the asymptotic approach is to simplify the object. This simplification is attained by decreasing the vicinity of the singularity under consideration. It is typical that the accuracy of asymptotic expansions grows with localization. Exactness and simplicity are commonly regarded as mutually exclusive notions. When tending to simplicity, we sacrifice exactness, and trying to achieve exactness, we expect no simplicity. Under localization, however, the antipodes converge; the contradiction is resolved in a synthesis called asymptotics. In other words, simplicity and exactness are coupled by an ‚Äúuncertainty principle‚Äù relation while the domain size serves as a small parameter ‚Äì a measure of uncertainty. Asymptotic uncertainty principle Let us illustrate the ‚Äúasymptotic uncertainty principle‚Äù. Take the expansion of the function f(x) in an asymptotic sequence {\\\\phi_n(x)}: f(x) = \\\\sum_{n=0}^{\\\\infty} a_n \\\\phi_n(x), x ‚Üí 0. A partial sum of the series is designated by S_N(x), and the exactness of approximation at a given N is estimated by \\\\Delta_N(x) = f(x) - S_N(x). Simplicity is characterized here by the number N and the locality by the length of interval x. Based on known properties of the asymptotic expansion, we consider the pair wise interrelation of values x, N, and \\\\Delta. At a fixed x the expansion initially converges, i.e., the exactness increases at the cost of simplicity. If we fix N, the exactness and the interval size begin to compete. The smaller the interval, the given value of \\\\Delta is reached more simply. We illustrate these regularities using a simple example. Consider the exponential integral function: \\\\operatorname{Ei}(y) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^y e^{\\\\zeta} \\\\zeta^{-1} d{\\\\zeta}, y < 0. Integrating by parts, we obtain the following asymptotic expansion \\\\operatorname{Ei}(y) \\\\sim e^y \\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\infty} (n-1)! y^{-n}, \\\\; y ‚Üí -\\\\infty. Put f(x) = -e-y \\\\operatorname{Ei}(y), y = -x-1. Calculating the partial sums of this series and the values \\\\Delta_N(x) and f(x) for different x yields: x f(x) \\\\Delta_1 \\\\Delta_2 \\\\Delta_3 \\\\Delta_4 \\\\Delta_5 \\\\Delta_6 \\\\Delta_7 1/3 0.262 0.071 0.040 0.034 0.040 0.060 0.106 0.223 1/5 0.171 0.029 0.011 0.006 0.004 0.0035 0.0040 0.0043 1/7 0.127 0.016 0.005 0.002 0.001 0.0006 0.0005 0.0004 Thus, at a given x, the exactness first increases with the growth of N and then decreases (so one has an asymptotic expansion). For a given N, one may observe an improvement of exactness with diminishing x. Finally, is it worth using asymptotic analysis if computers and numerical methods have reached such an advanced state?

The summer training is followed by a winter program where youth work through higher levels of training syllabus to become accredited members of the crew the following year.  History  Playfair was constructed for Toronto Brigantine Inc. in 1973 as an addition to an already established sail training organization which began operation with the STV Pathfinder in 1962. During the Royal Visit to Canada in 1973, Queen Elizabeth II christened Playfair at her launching in Kingston on Wednesday, June 27 with Pathfinder docked just astern; Prince Philip was in attendance. She was commissioned by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II in 1974, and remains the only Canadian ship to be commissioned by a reigning monarch. Although very similar to sister ships Pathfinder and St. Lawrence II, there are several minor structural differences such as a wider transom and a slightly larger freeboard. Since 1974 Playfair has conducted sail training on the Great Lakes with occasional summer voyages down the St. Lawrence River to the Atlantic, most recently in 2007 for Tall Ships Halifax. Playfair sailing in to Baie Fine in 2013  Interior layout  Playfair is divided into six watertight compartments from fore to aft the: Forepeak (general bosun stores, anchor chain bins); Petty Officer's Mess (sleeping space for 4 petty officers); Seamen's Mess (sleeping and living space for up to 18 trainees, also includes the galley); Engine Room (area for engine, generator and batteries); Wardroom (sleeping and living space for 6 wardroom officers, also includes the captain's cabin, a separate but not watertight compartment) and the Afterpeak (mooring line and fender storage and steering gear).

Casting Jason Flemyng was cast as Quatermass, with long-time Kneale admirer Mark Gatiss as Paterson, Andrew Tiernan as Carroon, Indira Varma as his wife Judith, David Tennant as Briscoe, Adrian Bower as Fullalove and Adrian Dunbar as Lomax‚Äînow a Ministry of Defence official rather than a policeman. Isla Blair was cast as Home Secretary Margaret Blaker, a combination of parts of Lomax's character and two officials from the original serial, and she brought to rehearsals a photograph of her husband Julian Glover on the set of the 1967 film version of Quatermass and the Pit. Blair stated that she was delighted to be joining \\"the Quatermass club\\". Original 1953 cast member Moray Watson, who had played Marsh, one of Quatermass's colleagues, visited the set during rehearsals. The 76-year-old was invited to make a cameo appearance in the live broadcast, but was not available that evening. It was during the rehearsals for The Quatermass Experiment that David Tennant was offered the role of the Tenth Doctor in Doctor Who. This casting was not announced to the public until later in April, but his fellow castmembers, and crew, became aware of the speculation surrounding Tennant; in the live broadcast Jason Flemyng changed Quatermass's first line to Tennant's Dr Briscoe from \\"Good to have you back, Gordon\\" to \\"Good to have you back, Doctor\\" as a deliberate reference. Production The remake was commissioned as part of a \\"TV on Trial\\" season being run by BBC Four, examining past television trends and productions. Although it was scheduled in a two-hour slot, the production finished after one hour and forty minutes‚Äîunderrunning its allotted time, whereas most of the original episodes had overrun. This was expected before transmission, however, after timings had been made at the dress rehearsal, and the increased pace was attributed to the nervousness involved in a live performance. Adapted from the original scripts by executive producer Richard Fell, the new broadcast was directed by Sam Miller. Kneale acted as a consultant, and Fell and producer Alison Willett had several meetings with the writer at his London home to discuss the script. Science writer and film maker Christopher Riley also acted as an advisor on the project, helping to bring the science references in the script up to date. Although Miller controlled the production's artistic direction, experienced outside broadcast director Trevor Hampton assisted him in controlling the technical aspects of the live production, which was broadcast from the QinetiQ (ex-Ministry of Defence) Longcross Test Track site in Surrey. The story was structurally very close to the original, although set in a slightly distorted version of the present day. The climax was moved from Westminster Abbey to the Tate Modern, as the latter was easier to replicate in studio, and there was no visible monster.

The broadcast suffered only a few errors, with some fluffed lines, several on- and off- camera stumbles, background sounds occasionally obscuring the dialogue, and, at the programme's end, a cameraman and sound man appearing in the shot. As the end credits rolled, the cameras showed actors celebrating and congratulating each other; they did not know that they were still on air. However, this could be interpreted as the characters celebrating their survival at the end of their ordeal. On two occasions near the middle of the broadcast a large on-screen graphic was overlaid, advising viewers that a major news story, the death of Pope John Paul II, was being covered on BBC News 24. Drawing an average audience of 482,000, The Quatermass Experiment became BBC Four's fourth-highest-rated programme of all time, behind The Curse of Steptoe, The Road to Coronation Street and The Alan Clark Diaries. Critic Nancy Banks-Smith in The Guardian complimented the production, and noted that \\"there were minor bumps in this production. One actor dried ... Another made a crashing exit through piles of broken glass left by the monster ... The last scene is still gripping ... I always said Nigel Kneale was a prophet.\\" She also commented that, for Tennant, \\"This was a useful dummy run for ... Doctor Who, playing a doctor confronted with a man-eating vegetable.\\" In The Times, Sarah Vine wrote that The Quatermass Experiment, \\"despite not always succeeding dramatically, did, however, serve as a reminder of how a clever story, a good script and some decent acting can be just as effective as millions of pounds' worth of special effects\\". Texas Monthly magazine commented it \\"is an interesting British experience from across the pond...highly gripping and worth a watch.\\" Other media The production was released on DVD in October 2005 by DD Home Entertainment, with an audio commentary and other extra features. It has also been repeated on BBC Four on several occasions.

Etymology The city was called by Macabees Adora (1 Macc. 13.20).Berrett, 1996, p. 196 According to Guy Le Strange, the city locality is in the Vale of Mamre mentioned in the story of The Twelve Spies who brought back to Moses large grapes of Eshkol as recorded in the Book of Numbers.Mukaddasi, 1895, p. 69 Mentioned as Adora by Apocrypha and often by Josephus. A weak letter is usually lost in Hebrew to Arabic sound conversion, such as in the case of Adoraim to Dura. A loss of a first feeble letter is not uncommon and the form of Dora could be found as early as in several instances of Josephus writings.

The concept is due to Augustin- Louis Cauchy, who never gave an (\\\\varepsilon,\\\\delta) definition of limit in his Cours d'Analyse, but occasionally used \\\\varepsilon,\\\\delta arguments in proofs. It was first given as a formal definition by Bernard Bolzano in 1817, and the definitive modern statement was ultimately provided by Karl Weierstrass. . Accessed 2009-05-01. It provides rigor to the following informal notion: the dependent expression f(x) approaches the value L as the variable x approaches the value c if f(x) can be made as close as desired to L by taking x sufficiently close to c. History Although the Greeks examined limiting process, such as the Babylonian method, they probably had no concept similar to the modern limit. The need for the concept of a limit arose in the 1600s, when Pierre de Fermat attempted to find the slope of the tangent line at a point x to the graph of a function such as f(x)=x^2. Using a non-zero but almost zero quantity E, Fermat performed the following calculation: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\text{slope} & = \\\\frac{f(x+E)-f(x)}{E} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\frac{(x+E)^2-x^2}{E}\\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\frac{x^2+2xE+E^2-x^2}{E} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\frac{2xE+E^2}{E} = 2x+E = 2x. \\\\end{align} The key to the above calculation is that since E is non-zero, one can divide f(x+E)-f(x) by E, but since E is close to 0, 2x+E is essentially 2x. Quantities such as E are called infinitesimals. The problem with this calculation is that mathematicians of the era were unable to rigorously define a quantity with properties of E, even though it was common practice to 'neglect' higher power infinitesimals and this seemed to yield correct results. This problem reappeared later in the 1600s at the center of the development of calculus, where calculations such as Fermat's are important to the calculation of derivatives. Isaac Newton first developed calculus via an infinitesimal quantity called a fluxion. He developed them in reference to the idea of an \\"infinitely small moment in time...\\" However, Newton later rejected fluxions in favor of a theory of ratios that is close to the modern \\\\varepsilon\\\\text{‚Äì}\\\\delta definition of the limit. Moreover, Newton was aware that the limit of the ratio of vanishing quantities was not itself a ratio, as he wrote: :Those ultimate ratios ... are not actually ratios of ultimate quantities, but limits ... which they can approach so closely that their difference is less than any given quantity... Additionally, Newton occasionally explained limits in terms similar to the epsilon‚Äìdelta definition. Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz developed an infinitesimal of his own and tried to provide it with a rigorous footing, but it was still greeted with unease by some mathematicians and philosophers. Augustin-Louis Cauchy gave a definition of limit in terms of a more primitive notion he called a variable quantity. He never gave an epsilon‚Äìdelta definition of limit (Grabiner 1981). Some of Cauchy's proofs contain indications of the epsilon‚Äìdelta method. Whether or not his foundational approach can be considered a harbinger of Weierstrass's is a subject of scholarly dispute. Grabiner feels that it is, while Schubring (2005) disagrees. Nakane concludes that Cauchy and Weierstrass gave the same name to different notions of limit.Nakane, Michiyo. Did Weierstrass's differential calculus have a limit- avoiding character? His definition of a limit in Œµ‚àíŒ¥ style. BSHM Bull. 29 (2014), no. 1, 51‚Äì59. Eventually, Weierstrass and Bolzano are credited with providing a rigorous footing for calculus, in the form of the modern \\\\varepsilon\\\\text{‚Äì}\\\\delta definition of the limit.. The need for reference to an infinitesimal E was then removed, and Fermat's computation turned into the computation of the following limit: : \\\\lim_{h\\\\to 0} \\\\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}. This is not to say that the limiting definition was free of problems as, although it removed the need for infinitesimals, it did require the construction of the real numbers by Richard Dedekind. This is also not to say that infinitesimals have no place in modern mathematics, as later mathematicians were able to rigorously create infinitesimal quantities as part of the hyperreal number or surreal number systems. Moreover, it is possible to rigorously develop calculus with these quantities and they have other mathematical uses. Informal statement A viable informal (that is, intuitive or provisional) definition is that a \\"function f approaches the limit L near a (symbolically, \\\\lim_{x \\\\to a}f(x) = L \\\\, ) if we can make f(x) as close as we like to L by requiring that x be sufficiently close to, but unequal to, a.\\" When we say that two things are close (such as f(x) and L or x and a), we mean that the difference (or distance) between them is small. When f(x), L, x, and a are real numbers, the difference/distance between two numbers is the absolute value of the difference of the two. Thus, when we say f(x) is close to L, we mean that f(x)-L is small. When we say that x and a are close, we mean that x-a is small. When we say that we can make f(x) as close as we like to L, we mean that for all non-zero distances, \\\\varepsilon, we can make the distance between f(x) and L smaller than \\\\varepsilon. When we say that we can make f(x) as close as we like to L by requiring that x be sufficiently close to, but, unequal to, a, we mean that for every non-zero distance \\\\varepsilon , there is some non-zero distance \\\\delta such that if the distance between x and a is less than \\\\delta then the distance between f(x) and L is smaller than \\\\varepsilon . The informal/intuitive aspect to be grasped here is that the definition requires the following internal conversation (which is typically paraphrased by such language as \\"your enemy/adversary attacks you with an \\\\epsilon , and you defend/protect yourself with a \\\\delta \\"): One is provided with any challenge \\\\epsilon > 0 for a given f,a, and L. One must answer with a \\\\delta > 0 such that 0 < x-a  < \\\\delta implies that f(x)-L < \\\\epsilon . If one can provide an answer for any challenge, then one has proven that the limit exists. Precise statement and related statements Precise statement for real-valued functions The (\\\\varepsilon, \\\\delta) definition of the limit of a function is as follows: Let f be a real-valued function defined on a subset D of the real numbers. Let c be a limit point of D and let L be a real number. We say that : \\\\lim_{x\\\\to c}f(x) = L if for every \\\\varepsilon > 0 there exists a \\\\delta > 0 such that, for all x\\\\in D, if 0 < x-c < \\\\delta , then f(x)-L < \\\\varepsilon. Symbolically: : \\\\lim_{x \\\\to c} f(x) = L \\\\iff (\\\\forall \\\\varepsilon > 0,\\\\,\\\\exists \\\\ \\\\delta > 0,\\\\,\\\\forall x \\\\in D,\\\\,0 < x - c < \\\\delta \\\\ \\\\Rightarrow \\\\ f(x) - L < \\\\varepsilon) If D=[a,b] or D=\\\\mathbb{R}, then the condition that c is a limit point can be replaced with the simpler condition that c belongs to D, since closed real intervals and the entire real line are perfect sets. Precise statement for functions between metric spaces The definition can be generalized to functions that map between metric spaces. These spaces come with a function, called a metric, that takes two points in the space and returns a real number that represents the distance between the two points. The generalized definition is as follows: Suppose f is defined on a subset D of a metric space X with a metric d_X(x,y) and maps into a metric space Y with a metric d_Y(x,y). Let c be a limit point of D and let L be a point of Y. We say that : \\\\lim_{x\\\\to c}f(x) = L if for every \\\\varepsilon > 0 , there exists a \\\\delta such that for all x\\\\in D, if 0 < d_X(x,c) < \\\\delta , then d_Y(f(x),L) < \\\\varepsilon. Since d(x,y) = x-y is a metric on the real numbers, one can show that this definition generalizes the first definition for real functions. Negation of the precise statement The logical negation of the definition is as follows: Suppose f is defined on a subset D of a metric space X with a metric d_X(x,y) and maps into a metric space Y with a metric d_Y(x,y). Let c be a limit point of D and let L be a point of Y. We say that : \\\\lim_{x\\\\to c}f(x) eq L if there exists an \\\\varepsilon > 0 such that for all \\\\delta > 0 there is an x\\\\in D such that 0 < d_X(x,c) < \\\\delta and d_Y(f(x),L) > \\\\varepsilon. We say that \\\\lim_{x\\\\to c}f(x) does not exist if for all L\\\\in Y, \\\\lim_{x\\\\to c}f(x) eq L . For the negation of a real valued function defined on the real numbers, simply set d_Y(x,y) = d_X(x,y)= x-y. Precise statement for limits at infinity The precise statement for limits at infinity is as follows: Suppose f is real- valued that is defined on a subset D of the real numbers that contains arbitrarily large values. We say that : \\\\lim_{x\\\\to\\\\infty}f(x) = L if for every \\\\varepsilon > 0, there is a real number N > 0 such that for all x\\\\in D, if x > N then f(x) - L < \\\\varepsilon. It is also possible to give a definition in general metric spaces. Worked examples Example 1 We will show that : \\\\lim_{x\\\\to 0} x\\\\sin{\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{x}\\\\right)} = 0 . We let \\\\varepsilon > 0 be given. We need to find a \\\\delta >0 such that x-0 < \\\\delta implies \\\\leftx\\\\sin\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{x}\\\\right) - 0\\\\right < \\\\varepsilon . Since sine is bounded above by 1 and below by ‚àí1, \\\\begin{align} \\\\leftx\\\\sin{\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{x}\\\\right)} - 0\\\\right &= \\\\leftx\\\\sin{\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{x}\\\\right)}\\\\right\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= x\\\\left\\\\sin{\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{x}\\\\right)}\\\\right \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\leq x. \\\\end{align} Thus, if we take \\\\delta = \\\\varepsilon, then x =x-0 < \\\\delta implies \\\\leftx\\\\sin{\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{x}\\\\right)} - 0\\\\right \\\\leq x < \\\\varepsilon , which completes the proof. Example 2 Let us prove the statement that : \\\\lim_{x\\\\to a} x^2 = a^2 for any real number a. Let \\\\varepsilon>0 be given. We will find a \\\\delta > 0 such that x-a<\\\\delta implies x^2-a^2<\\\\varepsilon . We start by factoring: : x^2-a^2 = (x-a)(x+a)=x-ax+a. We recognize that x-a is the term bounded by \\\\delta so we can presuppose a bound of 1 and later pick something smaller than that for \\\\delta. So we suppose x-a < 1 . Since x - y \\\\leq x-y holds in general for real numbers x and y, we have : x - a \\\\leq x-a < 1. Thus, : x < 1 + a. Thus via the triangle inequality, : x+a \\\\leq x + a < 2a + 1. Thus, if we further suppose that : x-a < \\\\frac{\\\\varepsilon}{2a +1} then :x^2-a^2 <\\\\varepsilon. In summary, we set : \\\\delta = \\\\min{\\\\left(1,\\\\frac{\\\\varepsilon}{2a +1}\\\\right)}. So, if x-a<\\\\delta, then : \\\\begin{align} x^2-a^2 &= x-ax+a \\\\\\\\\\\\ &< \\\\frac{\\\\varepsilon}{2a +1}(x+a)\\\\\\\\\\\\ &< \\\\frac{\\\\varepsilon}{2a +1}(2a+1)\\\\\\\\\\\\ &=\\\\varepsilon. \\\\end{align} Thus, we have found a \\\\delta such that x-a < \\\\delta implies x^2-a^2 <\\\\varepsilon . Thus, we have shown that : \\\\lim_{x\\\\to a} x^2 = a^2 for any real number a. Example 3 Let us prove the statement that : \\\\lim_{x \\\\to 5} (3x - 3) = 12. This is easily shown through graphical understandings of the limit, and as such serves as a strong basis for introduction to proof. According to the formal definition above, a limit statement is correct if and only if confining x to \\\\delta units of c will inevitably confine f(x) to \\\\varepsilon units of L. In this specific case, this means that the statement is true if and only if confining x to \\\\delta units of 5 will inevitably confine :3x - 3 to \\\\varepsilon units of 12. The overall key to showing this implication is to demonstrate how \\\\delta and \\\\varepsilon must be related to each other such that the implication holds. Mathematically, we want to show that : 0 <  x - 5  < \\\\delta \\\\ \\\\Rightarrow \\\\  (3x - 3) - 12  < \\\\varepsilon . Simplifying, factoring, and dividing 3 on the right hand side of the implication yields :  x - 5  < \\\\varepsilon / 3 , which immediately gives the required result if we choose : \\\\delta = \\\\varepsilon / 3 . Thus the proof is completed. The key to the proof lies in the ability of one to choose boundaries in x, and then conclude corresponding boundaries in f(x), which in this case were related by a factor of 3, which is entirely due to the slope of 3 in the line : y = 3x - 3 . Continuity A function f is said to be continuous at c if it is both defined at c and its value at c equals the limit of f as x approaches c: : \\\\lim_{x\\\\to c} f(x) = f(c). The (\\\\varepsilon, \\\\delta) definition for a continuous function can be obtained from the definition of a limit by replacing 0<x-c<\\\\delta with x-c<\\\\delta, to ensure that f is defined at c and equals the limit. A function f is said to be continuous on an interval I if it is continuous at every point c of I. Comparison with infinitesimal definition Keisler proved that a hyperreal definition of limit reduces the logical quantifier complexity by two quantifiers. Namely, f(x) converges to a limit L as x tends to a if and only if the value f(x+e) is infinitely close to L for every infinitesimal e. (See Microcontinuity for a related definition of continuity, essentially due to Cauchy.) Infinitesimal calculus textbooks based on Robinson's approach provide definitions of continuity, derivative, and integral at standard points in terms of infinitesimals. Once notions such as continuity have been thoroughly explained via the approach using microcontinuity, the epsilon‚Äìdelta approach is presented as well. Karel Hrb√°ƒçek argues that the definitions of continuity, derivative, and integration in Robinson-style non-standard analysis must be grounded in the Œµ‚ÄìŒ¥ method,, in order to cover also non-standard values of the input. B≈Çaszczyk et al. argue that microcontinuity is useful in developing a transparent definition of uniform continuity, and characterize the criticism by Hrb√°ƒçek as a \\"dubious lament\\". Hrb√°ƒçek proposes an alternative non-standard analysis, which (unlike Robinson's) has many \\"levels\\" of infinitesimals, so that limits at one level can be defined in terms of infinitesimals at the next level.

It was excavated by Walter Bryan Emery along with nearby Qustul between 1928 and 1931 as a rescue project before a second rising of the Aswan Low Dam. A total of 122 tombs were found under huge artificial mounds. They date to the time after the collapse of the Meroitic state but before the founding of the Christian Nubian kingdoms, around AD 350 to 600. They usually featured one or several underground chambers, with one main burial chamber. Some tombs were found unlooted, but even the robbed burials still proved to contain many burial goods. The objects found are chiefly of Nubian origin, but there were also many objects imported from Byzantine Egypt and the Mediterranean in general. Most remarkable is a set of crowns from different tombs showing that the richest burials belong to local ruling kings and queens. There were horses and servants buried with their masters. There are few written objects in the burials. The identification of the tomb owners is, therefore, impossible. It has been assumed that these are the burials of the kings and the court of Nobatia. One important tomb discovered here was tomb 118 which consisted of three chambers. It might be described as an example of a royal burial at Ballana and consisted of a main burial chamber and two storage rooms. The roof of the burial chamber had collapsed and the tomb, therefore, escaped looting. The body of the person buried here was found on a bier. It was most likely that of a king. Upon his head was found a crown. Under the bier, were the remains of a large wooden gaming board, weapons and an iron folding chair. There were also skeletons of a young male servant and a cow. In the two storerooms, more skeletons of servants, as well as pottery and several bronze lamps were discovered. The Ballana tombs belong to a culture complex often called X-Group. Following the find of these tombs, this culture is most often called Ballana Culture.TRIGGER, Bruce (1978). The Ballana Culture and the Coming of Christianity. In: The Essays, edited by S.

The psychology is about the psyche; the metapsychology is about the psychology. The term is used mostly in discourse about psychoanalysis, the psychology developed by Sigmund Freud, which was at its time regarded as a branch of science (with roots in the work of Freud's scientific mentors and predecessors, especially Helmholtz, Brucke, Charcot, and Janet), or, more recently, as a hermeneutics of understanding (with roots in Freud's literary sources, especially Sophocles and, to a lesser extent, Goethe and Shakespeare). Interest on the possible scientific status of psychoanalysis has been renewed in the emerging discipline of neuropsychoanalysis, whose major exemplar is Mark Solms. The hermeneutic vision of psychoanalysis is the focus of influential works by Donna Orange. Freud and the als ob problem Psychoanalytic metapsychology is concerned with the fundamental structure and concepts Freudian theory. Sigmund Freud first used the term on 13 February 1896 in a letter to Wilhelm Fliess, to refer to his addition of unconscious processes to the conscious ones of traditional psychology. On March 10, 1898, he wrote to Fiess: \\"It seems to me that () the theory of wish fulfillment has brought only the psychological solution and not the biological - or, rather, metapsychical - one. (I am going to ask you seriously, by the way, whether I may use the name metapsychology for my psychology that leads behind consciousness).\\" Three years after completing his unpublished Project for a Scientific Psychology, Freud's optimism had completely vanished. In a letter dated September 22 of that year he told Fliess: \\"I am not at all in disagreement with you, not at all inclined to leave psychology hanging in the air without an organic basis. But apart from this conviction, I do not know how to go on, neither theoretically nor therapeutically, and therefore must behave as if [als l√§ge] only the psychological were under consideration. Why I cannot fit it together [the organic and the psychological] I have not even begun to fathom\\". \\"When, in his 'Autobiographical Study' of 1925, Freud called his metapsychology a 'speculative superstructure'...the elements of which could be abandoned or changed once proven inadequate, he was, in the terminology of Kant's Critique of Judgment, proposing a psychology als ob or as if ‚Äì a heuristic model of mental functioning that did not necessarily correspond with external reality.\\" A salient example of Freud's own metapsychology is his characterization of psychoanalysis as a \\"simultaneously closed system, fundamentally unrelated and impervious to the external world and as an open system inherently connected and responsive to environmental influence. In the 1910s, Freud wrote a series of twelve essays, to be collected as Preliminaries to a Metapsychology. Five of these were published independently under the titles: \\"Instincts and Their Vicissitudes,\\" \\"Repression,\\" \\"The Unconscious,\\" \\"A Metapsychological Supplement to the Theory of Dreams,\\" and \\"Mourning and Melancholia.\\" The remaining seven remained unpublished, an expression of Freud's ambivalence about his own attempts to articulate the whole of his vision of psychoanalysis. In 1919 he wrote to Lou Andreas-Salome, \\"Where is my Metapsychology? In the first place it remains unwritten\\". In 1920 he published Beyond the Pleasure Principle, a text with metaphysical ambitions. Midcentury psychoanalyst David RapaportErwin, Edward (2002). \\"Metapsychology (p. 339)\\". defined the term thus: \\"Books on psychoanalysis usually deal with its clinical theory... there exists, however, a fragmentary‚Äîyet consistent‚Äîgeneral theory of psychoanalysis, which comprises the premises of the special (clinical) theory, the concepts built on it, and the generalizations derived from it... named metapsychology.\\" Freud's metapsychology # The topographical point of view - unconscious, preconscious, conscious # The dynamic point of view - id, ego, superego # The economic point of view - libido # The structural point of view - structure of the unconscious # The genetic point of view - genetics Ego psychologist Heinz Hartmann also added 'the adaptational point of view' to Freud's metapsychology, although Lacan who interpreted metapsychology as the symbolic, the Real, and the imaginary, said \\"the dimension discovered by analysis is the opposite of anything which progresses through adaptation\\". Criticism Freud's metapsychology has faced criticism, mainly from ego psychology. Object relations theorists such as Melanie Klein, shifted the focus away from intrapsychic conflicts and towards the dynamics of interpersonal relationships, leading to a unifocal theory of development that focused on the mother-child relationship. Most ego psychologists saw the structural point of view, Freud's latest metapsychology, as the most important. Some proposed that only the structural point of view be kept in metapsychology, because the topographical point of view made an unnecessary distinction between the unconscious and the preconscious (Arlow & Brenner) and because the economic point of view was viewed as redundant (Gill).

It is located adjacent to Highway 12, about 12 km north of Eilat, 1 km north west of Ein Netafim. The control of the border crossing was handed over to the Israel Airports Authority in 1980; nowadays it is closed. Very seldom it is reopened under special circumstances. There are plans to reopen the border crossing passage as alternative during festivals, in coordination with the Egyptian authorities.Future use of Netafim IAA, 2004 The border line is guarded accurately on both sides, on the Israeli side alongside Highway 12 (one of the two accommodation roads to Eilat) by the Israel Border Police and on the Egyptian side from some army positions. The border crossing is in the proximity of the Israel National Trail, but not exactly on the route, nevertheless many wanderers, who have lost their way, arrive at the border crossing to drink some water. History Today's border crossing sits at the eastern end of a mountain pass used by important roads throughout history. The medieval hajj road to Mecca coming from Egypt and the Maghreb passed through here, meeting with the one coming from Syria a little to the southeast, at the town of Aylah - modern-day Aqaba, the twin city of Eilat. The road coming from Egypt had to cross through a mountain pass in Sinai named either 'Aqabat Aylah (\\"the ascent of 'Aylah), Naqb al-'Aqabah (\\"the mountain pass of Aqaba\\") or Ras an-Naqb (\\"the head/promontory of the mountain pass\\"). Netafim/Ras an-Naqb keeps its strategic importance until today. The Egyptian military has a base at what is commonly spelled in Egypt as Ras El Naqb, and there is also an airport located there.http://www.flightstats.com/go/Airport/airportDetails.do?airportCode=RAF It should not be confused other sites of the same name, some not far away, such as the Jordanian Ras an-Naqb in the desert between Petra and Aqaba, and the Ras en Naqb village north of Beersheba fought over during World War I. At the end of the 1948-49 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, in the last day of Operation Uvda on March 10, 1949, the Negev Brigade captured the abandoned position of the Jordanian Arab Legion in Ras al-Naqb (Hebrew ◊®◊ê◊° ◊ê◊ú-◊†◊ß◊ë), exactly where the Netafim border crossing is located today. During the Suez Crisis in 1956, Ras al-Naqb was again one of the strategic positions important for gaining control of the Sinai Peninsula.

Ancestry and early life  Petrus Uscan was born in a family of prominent Armenian traders which had traded with the East for generations.Madras Rediscovered, Pg 121 His grandfather Coja Pogus (Paul) had been buried in Julfa. Very little is known of his early life except for the fact that he migrated to Madras in the year 1723 and settled in the city for the rest of his life.  Assumption of monopoly  As soon as Uscan arrived in Madras, the Nawab of the Carnatic visited Madras and Uscan lavished hospitality upon him. A pleased Nawab offered gifts and titles and sole monopoly of trade in Madras.  Endowments  Petrus Uscan donated lavishly for Christian religious endowments. He was one of the foremost contributors to the construction of St Rita's church in St Thome. A slab on the east wall of the church has the inscription \\"In memory of the Armenian nation, 1729\\". In April, the very same year, the grave of St Thomas was opened for public viewing. Uscan was among those present.Madras Rediscovered, Pg 122  Construction of Marmalong Bridge  Persian, Latin and Armenian on the northern edge of the Marmalong Bridge adjoining the Saidapet Bus Stand commemorate the construction of the first-ever Marmalong Bridge across the Adyar River. In 1728, Coja Petrus Uscan constructed the Marmalong Bridge across the Adyar River. It cost him 30,000 pagodas. Still, he paid the full amount and also donated 1,500 pagodas for the bridge's upkeep. The bridge no longer exists today, having been replaced by a second bridge. However, the bridge built by Uscan is the first ever bridge built across the Adyar. In 1726, he constructed the steps which led to the Catholic shrine atop St Thomas Mount which still bears a slab commemorating Uscan's legacy. He also donated 1,500 pagodas for the maintenance of the steps.  In service of the British East India Company   As Company Councillor  Uscan was appointed Company Councillor for the British East India Company. Uscan performed well in his newfound role, occasionally serving as the Company's envoy. In 1740, when the Maratha general Raghuji Bhonsle invaded the Carnatic, Petrus Uscan was appointed the British envoy to negotiate peace with the Maratha general. Uscan negotiated with the Marathas and impressed the general so much that he even recognized British rule over Tiruchirappalli, Madras and Fort St David. On another occasion, Petrus Uscan succeeded in obtaining exclusive rights for the British of Madras to mint coins in their own name.  During French occupation  When the French occupied Madras in 1746, they seized Petrus Uscan's belongings and carried them off to Pondicherry.Madras Rediscovered, Pg 120 Uscan fled Madras and sought refuge in a Danish ship. Dupleix, then the governor of French India, offered him French protection and restoration of confiscated property in the name of the Capuchin chapel of Madras Armenians if Uscan shifted his loyalty to the French. However, Uscan gave a defiant reply that the Armenian tradition was to remain loyal to one's benefactors.  Later life  When Madras reverted to British control in 1749, Petrus Uscan and one Mrs. Madeiros were the only Catholics permitted to reside in the Fort. Following the reestablishment of British rule over Madras, the Capuchin chapel in the Fort was destroyed by the British who felt that the chief Armenian priest had spied for the French. Petrus managed to retain Armenian hold over the Chapel of Our Lady of Miracles in Vepery for some time. But after his death, it was made over to Protestants and a suitable compensation provided to the Armenian community which previously owned it.  Death  Petrus Uscan died in 1751 and was buried in the Chapel of Our Lady of Miracles, which he owned. On Protestant occupation of the site in the middle of the 18th century, they built an Anglican church over it. Petrus Uscan's tombstone was however left untouched and it remains to this day.  Legacy  The Armenian community of Madras gained prominence in the 17th century AD and exercised a significant amount of power and domination over early Madras till the middle of the 19th century. Coja Petrus Uscan who led the Armenian community of Madras from 1723 to 1751 is regarded as the greatest and most famous member of the community.Madras Rediscovered, Pg 119 The community has almost become extinct, yet its memory survives through Petrus Uscan's numerous endowments and works of charity.

Troger's illusionistic ceiling paintings in fresco are notable for their dramatic vitality of movement and their palette of light colors. Paul Troger‚Äôs style, particularly in his frescoes, dominated Austrian painting until the end of the 18th century and profoundly influenced significant artists of the next generation, notably Franz Anton Maulbertsch, Josef Ignaz Mildorfer, Johann Wenzel Bergl and Johann Lucas Kracker.  Life  Paul Troger was born on 30 October 1698 in Welsberg, in the Puster Valley of the County of Tyrol. At the age of 16, under the patronage of the aristocratic Tyrolean von Firmian family, he visited Fiume and became a pupil of Giuseppe Alberti. He painted his first fresco ‚ÄúThree Angels with the Cross and Putti‚Äù, in the Kalvarienkirche, Kaltern (1722). In 1722, the prince-bishop of Gurk sent Paul Troger to Venice, where he discovered the works of Giovanni Battista Piazzetta, and Giovanni Battista Pittoni. Troger also studied in Rome with Sebastiano Ricci, in Naples with Francesco Solimena and in Bologna, the leading artistic centers of Italy at the time. On his return to Austria, Troger first worked in Salzburg from 1726 to 1728, where he painted the \\"Glory of Saint Cajetan\\" on the ceiling of St. Cajetan‚Äôs Church, Salzburg (1728). He afterwards established himself in Vienna, where the art of ceiling frescoes was, however, dominated by Johann Michael Rottmayr and Daniel Gran. Paul Troger became the favourite fresco painter in Lower Austrian monasteries in collaboration with the architect Josef Munggenast. In 1753, he joined the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts. Troger became professor and was made director of the Imperial Academy in 1754. His most prominent student was Franz Anton Maulbertsch. His most important contribution to Austrian painting was to reject the strong dark palette, typical of the beginning of the 18th century, in favor of an increasingly lighter palette, typical of the new Rococo taste.  Works  Ceiling painting of the Marble Hall, Melk Abbey (1731) Apotheosis of Charles VI for the Imperial staircase, G√∂ttweig Abbey (1739) Although he did many easel altar paintings and drawings, Paul Troger became famous for his frescoes and much in demand throughout the Austrian lands. Troger's frescoes are remarkable for their immense vitality of movement and their light colors.

The most recent campaign off this area of the Isola Lunga has just closed (September 1971). [...] a Punic ship of such unique importance has been found that all other work was discontinued in its favour.‚Äù Anzovin, p. 275 item 4240 The first warship known from archeological evidence is the Marsala Ship, a wreck discovered in 1969 [sic] in the harbor [sic] of Marsala in western Sicily, Italy. It is a wreck discovered in 1971 in an area called Punta Scario in the harbor of Marsala in western Sicily, Italy, near the Aegadian Islands. The Marsala Ship's \\"nationality\\" was painted on the sides with letters by its Punic builders from Carthage. Ship Plaster casts of the stern and keel of the Punic ship Its architecture and contents show that it was not a merchant cargo ship. A merchant cargo ship made regular journeys and required large containers for storing water. It also needed grinders and mortars for dried food. It would normally carry large pots for communal cooking. It would also have fish-hooks for catching available fresh fish. The Marsala Ship had only small cups and bowls for individual servings. Its wine, water, and other liquids were carried in amphorae of miscellaneous shapes. Food remains were fresh and perishable, such as various kinds of butchered meat. Bones of deer, horses, oxen, sheep, goats and pigs were all found. All this indicated it was intended as a warship and not as a merchant cargo vessel. The presence of ballast stones and lack of merchant cargo definitely indicate that it was a warship, probably used for scouting purposes or for ramming smaller boats. The remains of marijuana stems ‚Äî which may have been chewed by the oarsmen ‚Äî were also found in the wreck. It is believed to have been one of the Liburnian \\"long ships\\", an oared vessel with 17 sweeps per side used by ancient Carthage in the Battle of the Aegates Islands (241 BC). This was the last battle of the First Punic War between Carthage and the Roman Republic. Carbon-14 tests on timbers and other materials determined a date of 235 BC. The vessel was determined to be approximately 35 meters (115 feet) long and 4.8 metres (15.7 feet) wide. Excavation In 1969 a captain of a commercial dredge digging sand for making glass discovered buried wood from ancient vessels in the area of Punta Scario. In 1971 the movement of a sandbank exposed the \\"Punic Ship's\\" stern post with projecting timber. This endangered the shipwreck, threatening the loss of the potential historical value of the information it revealed about the Phoenicians. Rescue excavation began in earnest and continued for the next four years. The Sicilian authorities and the British School at Rome appointed Honor Frost to direct the excavation. Frost and her international team of marine archeologists excavated the site. Progress reports were published yearly in the International Journal of Nautical Archaeology (London and New York). When the field-work ended, a comprehensive report was published by the 'Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei (Rome) as a Supplement to Notizie degli Scavi di Antichit√†, XXX (1976). Some extremely rare finds amongst the shipwreck were a plaited basket, a piece of rope fashioned into a simple eye splice, a little brush, a knife blade, a spade, and a couple of toggles. Also found were parts of a human skeleton, possibly of a Carthaginian sailor trapped by the ship's ballast.

Kenny's results have made him one of his sport's biggest stars; his dominance over multiple Paralympics gave rise to his nickname of 'Daz the Destroyer'. Darren Kenny OBE retired from competition in 2013. He is now the founder/owner of Estrella Bikes. Career Born in Salisbury, Wiltshire, Kenny now lives in Verwood, Dorset. Having been involved in cycling since he was young, Kenny started racing at the age of eleven. In 1988, at the age of 19, an accident at the Tour of Ireland whilst descending the Wicklow Gap looked likely to have ended his career. He had damaged his neck, but did not realise the extent of the damage at the time. A series of accidents after that exacerbated his condition, as Kenny put it: \\"until I was just lying on the sofa putting on weight and on heavy medication.\\" At the age of 30, Kenny returned to cycling, initially to improve his fitness, but he soon began racing once more. Encouraged by a friend, Kenny contacted British Cycling to find out more about Paralympics racing. He competed at the British National Track Championships, achieving some good times, he was invited onto the Paralympic squad. In January 2008, Kenny was nominated for \\"Sportsperson of the Year with a Disability\\" Laureus World Sports Awards, which recognise sporting achievement during the previous year. Kenny managed to set a new world record in the preliminary round of the Individual pursuit (CP 3) at the 2008 Paralympics. The new record was 5.812 seconds faster than his own previous world record. Kenny was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2009 New Year Honours. Awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Arts by Bournemouth University in 2009 and an Honorary Degree Masters in Science by Brighton University.

In spite of having been killed during his duties as priest, the Catholic Church never considered making him Saint unlike other priests and bishops that were lenient toward Franchism, Fascism and Nazism. Minzoni was born to a middle-class family. He studied in seminary and in 1909 was ordained priest. The following year he was appointed Deputy Pastor in the town of Argenta (in Emilia-Romagna), which he left in 1912 to go to study in the Scuola Sociale in Bergamo, where he was awarded his degree. Admired both for his courage and determination to cooperate with farmers during World War I Father Minzoni was sent to the front between Italy and Austro-Hungary as an army chaplain.  World War I  Called up by the army of the Kingdom of Italy in August 1916, he asked to serve as a military chaplain among the young soldiers at the Italian north-eastern front, and during a very critical moment in the Battle of the Piave River, he showed great courage for which he was awarded the Silver Medal of Military Valor.  Campaign for social rights after World War I  At the end of World War I, Fr Minzoni returned to Argenta, where he joined the Popular Party (Partito Popolare Italiano) the fore-runner of the Christian Democrats. Although this was a rather centrist party, he became friends with the socialist labor union leader Natale Gaiba, who was assassinated by the blackshirts in 1923. This and many other episodes turned him against Fascism. In addition to ideas about social rights, he became increasingly convinced of the need for cooperation, thus becoming an open enemy of the fascist regime that strongly favored corporativism.  Antifascism  After some time Giovanni Minzoni rejected the introduction of the fascist youth movement, the Opera Nazionale Balilla in Argenta, because he preferred to educate the young people of the town in the values of Catholicism. After meeting Father Emilio Faggioli, the founder in April 1917 of the scout group Bologna I, and who became regional assistant for Catholic Scouts in Emilia-Romagna, Minzoni became convinced of the virtues and good values taught by the Scout Movement. He therefore decided to found a scout group in his own parish.  Scout movement in Argenta  In July 1923, Minzoni invited Monsignor Faggioli to speak about the aims of the scouts in the parish hall in Argenta. Local fascists vocally objected to the formation of a youth group not under the control of Mussolini and vowed that no scouts would enter the main square, to which Faggioli replied that the scouts would enter the main square as long as Minzoni was there. More than seventy scouts were subsequently enrolled.  Death of Giovanni Minzoni  Increasingly in conflict with the local Mussolinian establishment, Father Minzoni was killed around 10:30 pm on August 23, 1923 by two fascist \\"squadristi\\", Giorgio Molinari e Vittore Casoni, who smashed his skull with a club; they were reportedly following orders of the local \\"Console di Milizia\\" Italo Balbo, who was so shaken by the scandal that he had to resign temporarily from his post, though all the accused were later acquitted at trial in 1925. Just before his death, Don Minzoni wrote in his diary: His death turned his prayer into reality, with a promise made before departing for WWI:  Echoes in the Italian press  After receiving news about the murder of Don Minzoni, Italian newspapers, :it:Il Popolo and :it:La Voce Repubblicana, still partly free in 1923 extensively covered the murder, and soon disclosed all the direct executors of the fascist murder, and their secret instigator (Italo Balbo), later absolved at trial due to interference and pressure from the fascist squads and media. A new trial was held after the end of World War II, when the fascists were no longer able to threaten and cover up the truth. The verdict absolved Balbo from all the charges, although the trial ended with the condemnation of two men for second degree murder. After the war, Giovanni Minzoni became a symbol of the Italian Catholic Resistance, and many books were written about the martyrdom of this lesser parish priest, widely known for his courage and sanctity. As of 2016, his martyrdom was still being commemorated by groups including Azione Cattolica and the Christian Associations of Italian Workers.

Early models closely resembled the Triumph Bonneville in style. In 1975 the bike was renamed XS500 and then continued to be updated until 1978 when sales ended in the USA. In Europe, the model was available through 1980. History The TX500 debuted in Tokyo in October 1972. It arrived in most markets in 1973, along with the larger TX750. Like Yamaha's earlier XS650, both the TX500 and TX750 were four-stroke air-cooled twins. While the TX500 and TX750 were released at or near the same time, there were significant differences between their engines. The short production life of the TX500 was due in part to problems with engine leaks and failures. The TX750 experienced similar problems, which were in part attributed to aeration of the engine oil caused by the operation of the anti-vibration system. Yamaha attributed the problem to excessive heat build-up in the engine and a lack of machine durability. In the TX500 excessive heat build-up promoted warped valve seats and cracked cylinder heads. Its exhaust ports were re-shaped on later engines to improve heat dissipation. 1973 * TX500 is introduced. Model code is 371. * Fuel tank is rounded. * Side covers have imitation air intakes. * Brakes are single front disk, rear drum. 1974 * Designation changed to TX500A. * Rear brake wear sender added. 1975 * Bike is renamed XS500; full name is XS500B. Model code remains 371. * Carburetors receive new jets and plunger- style enrichers. * Balance tube added to intake manifold. * Enlarged balance pipe installed between exhausts. * Fork spring preload reduced. 1976 * Model designation is now XS500C. Model code changes to 1J3. * New, more rectangular tank and new side panels. * New seat cowling with integrated mudguard. * Front fender is mounted without stays. Fender is now body colored. * New 38 mm Mikuni carburetors. * Cylinder and camboxes are now a single casting. * Compression ratio drops from 9.0:1 to 8.5:1 * Drive cogs change from 17/43 to 16/42. * Front fork is now from Showa. * Alloy wheels replace spoked wheels. * Disk brake replaces rear drum. * Front caliper now mounted behind fork. 1977 * Model designation changes to XS500D. * Compression ratio is raised from 8.5:1 to 9.6:1 1978 * Model designation changes to XS500E. * Last year of sales in the USA. Engine and drivetrain The TX500 was powered by a transverse air- cooled parallel twin engine which had a 180¬∞ crankshaft. In contrast to the dry-sumped TX750, the TX500 had a wet sump. The valvetrain used double overhead camshafts (DOHC) and four valves per cylinder, which were operated by rocker arms for each pair of valves. Yamaha claimed this was the world's first mass-produced four-valve motorcycle engine. The TX500 was also claimed to be the first motorcycle to use an integrated circuit-based voltage regulator. The air/fuel mixture was delivered by two 32 mm Keihin constant-velocity (CV) carburetors in early models and by 38 mm Mikunis beginning in 1976. The TX500 and TX750 twins both featured a vibration control technology that Yamaha called an \\"Omni-phase balancer\\". In the TX750 two chain-driven shafts with bobweights counteracted vibrations generated in the engine, while the balancer in the TX500 was a simpler version with just a single balance shaft. The chain driving the balance shaft was hidden behind the alternator, making manual adjustment difficult. The transmission was a 5-speed fully meshed unit that drove the rear wheel through a #530 chain and a 17/43 sprocket set. The drive cogs were later changed to 16/42. The bike came with both kick and electric start. Chassis and suspension The frame was a steel double-downtube cradle. The front suspension was a telescopic fork from Kayaba until 1976, when it became a Showa part. Rear suspension was by dual shock-absorbers and swing arm with adjustable pre-load. On early bikes the front brake was a single disk, while in back was a drum. In 1976 the front disk was increased in size to , and the rear drum was converted to a single disk. 1976 was also the year that alloy wheels were substituted for the traditional wire spokes previously mounted. The front tire size was 3.25-19-4PR and the rear was 3.50-18-4PR. Rear tire size rose to 4.00H-18-4PR on later bikes. Reviews and riding impressions Early reviews of the TX500 complimented the bike's handling, crediting the Omni-phase system with smoothing out the engine's inherent vibration. The brakes were also highly rated. A problem with sticking carburetor slides was experienced. Other reviewers found that power came on strongly and suddenly, especially in lower gears. There was also strong engine braking when the throttle was backed off. The transmission got high marks in other tests, but the carburetors were criticized. Other testers found fault with the push-pull throttle cable arrangement, and commented on slack in the drivetrain causing some jerkiness. The bike was described as being heavy for its displacement but not feeling the weight on the road. Some wheel skip was induced on a high-speed decreasing-radius downhill turn. Reviews of the revised XS500 indicated that the touchy throttle, carburetor issues and transmission lash of the TX500 had been addressed.

Life He was Abbot of the Cistercian monastery of Lockum in Hanover. At the death of Saint Meinhard, the first Bishop of Livonia (c. 1196), Hartwig of Uthlede, Archbishop of Bremen, to whose province belonged the newly converted countries along the eastern shores of the Baltic Sea, appointed Abbot Berthold successor. Damberger asserts Synchronistische Geschichte der Kirche und der Welt im Mittelalter that when Meinhard came to Bremen in 1186 to obtain help with his mission in Livonia, Berthold joined the band of missionaries who accompanied him there. The Livonian pagans were fanatically opposed to Christianity. Berthold's predecessor, assisted by merchants from Bremen and L√ºbeck and a few converts, had built fortifications along the River D√ºna, where Christians held their religious services and could protect themselves. Following in the footsteps of his predecessor, Berthold tried to gain confidence and good will by kindness. At first the pagans appeared to become less hostile, but soon their old hatred revived. When Berthold attempted to bless the Christian cemetery at Holm, they decided either to burn the bishop together with his church at Holm or to drown him in the D√ºna. The Christians fled to their strongholds at √úxk√ºll and Holm, while the bishop escaped in a ship to L√ºbeck. Pope Celestine III, shortly before his death, was preparing to send a fleet of crusaders to protect the Christians of the Baltic Provinces, and his successor, Pope Innocent III, continued the work. Berthold gained the financial assistance of Archbishop Hartwig and many merchants of Bremen and L√ºbeck. In a short time a large fleet was ready for departure, well equipped and loaded with crusaders and many German peasants who were to settle permanently in Livonia. It put to sea at L√ºbeck and crossed the Baltic, entering the River D√ºna from what is now called the Gulf of Riga. Near the mouth of the D√ºna the German peasants landed with the purpose of making their homes in the vicinity, and laid the foundations of the city Riga. Berthold, accompanied by the crusaders, sailed up the river as far as Holm, where the Livonians had gathered with the intention of attacking the fleet. Having failed to come to a peaceful agreement with them, Berthold and his companions sailed some distance down the river, with the Livonians in pursuit. The pagans agreed to a truce, to gain time, but they attacked the Christians who ventured outside their fortifications, and hostilities were resumed. The crusaders were victorious, but Berthold's horse became intractable and galloped into the midst of the fleeing Livonians. A pagan by the name of Ymaut (wrongly read as Ymant)Krusta ka≈ói BaltijƒÅ . Latvju enciklopƒìdija. 3. sƒìjums, 2647-2661.lpp. thrust his lance into Berthold's back, inflicting a wound that caused speedy death. The bishop's body was buried by the crusaders at √úxk√ºll, and was later transferred to Riga by Albert of Riga, whom Archbishop Hartwig of Bremen had appointed Berthold's successor. After the death of Berthold some of the conquered pagans asked to be baptized. The final conversion of Livonia was effected by Bishop Albert, who was assisted in by the newly founded Order of the Brothers of the Sword, which in 1237 was affiliated with the Teutonic Order.

Gr√∏nvold was among the last natural history illustrators to publish lithographs. Background Henrik Gr√∏nvold was born in Pr√¶st√∏, Denmark. He was the son of Hans Peter Levin Gr√∏nvold (1822‚Äì84) and Wilhelmine Marie Cathrine Lassen (1821‚Äì65). He had an early interest in natural history, and an early aptitude for natural history art. In 1880, he went to Copenhagen to learn machine drawing at the Copenhagen Technical College. After graduation, he worked first as a draughtsman of the Royal Danish Army's artillery and an illustrator at the Biological Research Station of Copenhagen. In 1892, Gr√∏nvold left Denmark intending to emigrate to the United States. While stopping in London en route, he was employed at the Natural History Museum preparing anatomical specimens. His Swedish-born wife, Josefina Wilhelmina Hillstr√∏m (1869-1935), joined him a year later. Career Henrik Gr√∏nvold became a skilled taxidermist, and established a reputation as an artist. He was employed at the Museum until 1895, when he accompanied William Ogilvie-Grant on an expedition to the Salvage Islands. After this expedition, Gr√∏nvold worked at the Museum in an unofficial capacity as an artist for decades, and only left London to attend an ornithological congress in Berlin. His illustrations largely appeared in scientific periodicals such as the Proceedings and Transactions of the Zoological Society, The Ibis and the Avicultural Magazine. In these publications, he drew plates for William Ogilvie-Grant, George Albert Boulenger, and Michael Rogers Oldfield Thomas, among others. Gr√∏nvold also completed numerous plates for Walter Rothschild, many of which appeared in Rothschild's journal Novitates Zoologicae. Gr√∏nvold mostly illustrated birds and eggs, rare and newly discovered species from many parts of the world, and mostly worked in lithographs. His egg plates include some of great auk eggs made for Alfred Newton. He made some depictions of mammals as well, and the Natural History Museum collection has oil paintings of apes he made for Rothschild. Among the books he illustrated were George Shelley's Birds of Africa, which contained 57 plates, many of species that had not been illustrated before. He illustrated W. L. Buller's books on the birds of New Zealand, Brabourne's Birds of South America, Henry Eliot Howard's The British Warblers (1907‚Äì14), Charles William Beebe's A Monograph of the Pheasants (1918‚Äì22), and Herbert Christopher Robinson's The Birds of the Malay Peninsula (1929‚Äì76). He completed 600 hand-coloured plates for twelve volumes of The Birds of Australia (1910‚Äì27) by Gregory Macalister Mathews.

The film was distributed by Universal Pictures. It was based on Lucille Fletcher's 1960 novel of the same name. Sequences were filmed in Silver Springs, Florida and Central Park in New York City. Plot General Pratt, a national security chief, and his aides approach Dr. Bartholomew Snow, a successful psychiatrist, to assist the U.S. government in secrecy. A patient once psychoanalyzed by Dr. Snow is a government scientist who has had a mental breakdown. General Pratt hides the patient, Arthur Vincenti, in a remote place known only as \\"Base X\\", forcing Dr. Snow to wear a blindfold whenever he is taken there by airplane and car. Enemy agents and an organization who kidnap and sell scientists to the highest bidder want to know what Vincenti knows, so he is in danger. The patient's sister, beautiful Vicky Vincenti, mistakenly believes that Dr. Snow is the one who abducted him. When she has the doctor arrested, Snow tells both the authorities and the press that he and Vicky are actually having a lovers' quarrel and are engaged to be married in order to keep the Vincenti affair secret. Snow is a man with seven failed engagements and sees nothing wrong with using a false engagement to keep Vicky quiet. All are satisfied with the explanation except a suspicious NYPD detective named Harrigan. A stuttering man named Fitzpatrick turns up for a session with Dr. Snow and shows CIA credentials. Fitzpatrick claims to Dr. Snow that it is actually General Pratt who is the enemy agent. That makes sense to Dr. Snow as he could not understand why Vincenti would not have been placed in a military hospital. Unable to find the general, and with the authorities unwilling to reveal whether General Pratt or Fitzpatrick work for the government, Dr. Snow tries to recreate sounds he heard while blindfolded to trace his way back to Base X. He does so, only to find that Fitzpatrick has taken both Vincenti and Pratt captive. But soldiers arrive in airboats and place Fitzpatrick under arrest, leaving Vicky to consider whether she would like her make-believe engagement to Dr. Snow to be real.

Biography Butterfield obtained his Ph.D. from the University of Cambridge in 1984; he was supervised by Hugh Mellor and David Malament. He was a lecturer in the philosophy faculty at Cambridge University and was later promoted to reader in 1997. In 1998, he became a senior research fellow at All Souls College at the University of Oxford; he returned to the University of Cambridge in his present position in 2006. He has held visiting positions at Princeton University, the University of Pittsburgh and the University of Sydney. Butterfield is a fellow of the British Academy and a senior research fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge. He is a past president of the British Society for the Philosophy of Science, and of the Mind Association. He previously served on the governing board of the Philosophy of Science Association and on the executive committee of the British Philosophical Association. He co-founded the journal Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics, and edited it until 2001. He serves on the editorial boards of several journals and book series. Research Butterfield's research centres around a variety of topics in the philosophy of physics and philosophy of science, and he has also made contributions to the philosophy of language and logic, particularly with regard to the treatment of time and tense. In this regard, he has argued in several papers for a detensed theory of time, according to which the present is a merely subjective or indexical notion, on analogy with one's spatial location. In the philosophy of quantum theory, Butterfield has proposed several clarifications of the notions of locality operative in algebraic quantum field theories (especially 'stochastic Einstein locality'), and has investigated which of these clarified versions of locality hold in those theories. He has also investigated the impact of the Bell inequalities in the light of Reichenbach's principle of the common cause, and has argued that the violation of these inequalities implies causation between the space-like separated wings of a Bell experiment. In addition, he has written on the quantum measurement problem, and the implications for it due to, and of it for, the philosophy and science of consciousness. He has also investigated the problems of localizability in relativistic quantum theories, in collaboration with Gordon Fleming. In the philosophy of spacetime physics, Butterfield has argued for a resolution of Einstein's 1913 hole argument that preserves spacetime substantivalism by utilizing David Lewis's theory of modal counterparts. More recently, he has appealed to tensor calculus, and its use in much of contemporary physics, to argue against the popular view (propounded by David Lewis) that the world may be described in terms of 'local matters of fact'; i.e. in terms of chiefly intrinsic properties instantiated at spatial or spatio-temporal points. In the philosophy of classical mechanics, Butterfield has investigated the elimination of descriptively redundant formal elements through symplectic reduction, and the interdependence between conserved quantities and conservation laws. He has also made several appeals in his work, on classical mechanics and other physical theories, to the importance of an appreciation of modality in physics. In several papers, Butterfield has collaborated with the theoretical physicist Chris Isham. These address the role of topos theory in understanding quantum theory (in particular the Kochen‚ÄìSpecker theorem), and the status of time in the various quantum gravity research programmes. In recent years, Butterfield has argued for a reconciliation of the idea of emergence ‚Äì the idea that novel structures, not described by \\"fundamental\\" theories, appear at a certain level of complexity ‚Äì with the possibility of inter-theoretic reduction. He has illustrated the reconciliation in various areas such as phase transitions, renormalization, and gauge theories. He has also worked, often in collaboration with research students, on other topics, including: (i) identity and individuation of systems in quantum physics; (ii) dualities especially gauge/gravity duality; (iii) under-determination, and scientific realism, in modern cosmology.

The song is one of their best known, notable for using the word \\"fuck\\" 105 times, 93 times by Violent J, 10 times by Shaggy 2 Dope, and twice by Jumpsteady. Background In 1996, Insane Clown Posse signed a contract with Disney-owned label Hollywood Records, which reportedly paid US$1 million to purchase their contract from Battery/Jive Records. Their album The Great Milenko, which featured guests Alice Cooper (on vocals), Steve Jones (on guitar), and Slash (on guitar), was recorded and released on June 25, 1997. However, just hours after the release, Hollywood Records pulled the album from stores nationwide, cancelled Insane Clown Posse's in-store signings and nationwide tour, pulled commercials for the album and the music video for \\"Halls of Illusions\\" from television, and dropped the group from the label. It was later revealed that Disney pulled the album to prevent further controversy from the Southern Baptist Church who was criticizing Disney at the time because of Disney's promotion of Gay Days at Disneyland. The incident became highly publicized, which resulted in Insane Clown Posse gaining a lot of attention from the media. During the two years between The Great Milenko and The Amazing Jeckel Brothers, the first album released after the group left Disney, Insane Clown Posse had become nationally known, but were not taken very seriously. While the controversy allowed the duo to attract the attention of Island Records, it also attracted Insane Clown Posse to public criticism for their style and lyrics. Bruce recalls the period as an angry era for the group due to all of the negativity directed toward them. He says that they \\"used to keep two piles of press at [their] office. One pile was all the positive press [they've] gotten, which was under an inch tall. Then [they] had the negative press pile, which was spilling over the side of a full basket.\\" As a result, The Amazing Jeckel Brothers was recorded as a release for their anger. To help increase their positive publicity, Island Records hired the Nasty Little Man publicity team.http://www.avclub.com/articles/violent-j-of- insane-clown-posse,60282/ The team set up a photo shoot for Insane Clown Posse that was to appear on the cover of Alternative Press magazine in Cleveland. On the set of the photo shoot, a member of the publicity team approached Bruce and explained that in \\"Fuck the World\\", the lyric that stated \\"Fuck the Beastie Boys and the Dalai Lama\\" needed to be changed. Insulted, Bruce exclaimed that his music would not be censored again ‚Äì referring to Disney's previous requirement of censure. Nasty Little Man told Bruce that the Beastie Boys were not only clients of the company but also personal friends, and the Beastie Boys told the company to make Bruce change the lyric. In response, Bruce fired Nasty Little Man and asked its team to leave the photo shoot. Concept The song follows an angry Violent J as he curses a wide variety of things. The chorus echoes the same hate for the world illustrated in each verse (\\"If I only could I'd set the world on fire/Fuck the world/Fuck 'em all\\"). While the song consists of seemingly mindless cursing throughout most of it, the futility of such rage is illustrated in the final curse, as he adds \\"and fuck Violent J.\\" Notable people, places, and objects cursed include Beastie Boys, the Dalai Lama, Forrest Gump, Oprah Winfrey, Kyle Petty, Tom Petty, Fred Bear, Ted Nugent, The Count of Monte Cristo, Cisco, Jack Brisco, Jerry Brisco, Titanic, Celine Dion, Dionne Warwick, Berlin Wall, Lyle Lovett, Jumpsteady, Rocky Maivia, Spin, Rolling Stone, VIBE, President Bill Clinton, and Violent J himself. The group also used the line \\"Fuck the police, and the 5-0 too\\", which came from the late rapper Eazy-E's song \\"8 Ball\\". Performance During live shows, Insane Clown Posse will usually change the lyrics to add other insults to people or figures that reflect the current time, public radio, MTV, Blender Magazine, and themselves. \\"Fuck the World\\" was one of the songs performed by Insane Clown Posse at Woodstock '99. Cover versions The single was recorded and remixed by the Axe Murder Boys in 2010 for DJ Clay's Book of the Wicked, Chapter One mixtape. Richard Cheese covers the song in his usual lounge style on his 2020 album Numbers Of The Beast.

Angelo Anthony Lonardo (1911 ‚àí March 31, 2006) was a mobster who became the acting boss of Cleveland crime family in the early 1980s. Lonardo was born in 1911 in Cleveland to Joseph and Concetta Lonardo. His godfather was Anthony Milano. After his father was murdered by a member of the Porrello crime family in 1927, 16-year-old Lonardo swore revenge and murdered Salvatore Todaro with his cousin Dominic Sospirato. Lonardo was tried and sentenced to life in prison. However, his lawyer was able to get a second trial and he was discharged and released. He later joined Milano's brother Frank in the Cleveland crime family. He eventually worked his way up to underboss in 1976. After his arrest in 1983, Lonardo became a government informant and testified against his former colleagues and several mob figures throughout the US. Lonardo and Jimmy Fratianno, the acting boss of the Los Angeles crime family, were the highest-ranking mobsters to become federal witnesses, until Gambino crime family underboss, Sammy \\"the Bull\\" Gravano during the early 1990s.

It is widespread and common in Europe and North America, appearing under both conifer and deciduous trees in summer and autumn. The fruiting body is a small all-white or cream mushroom with a fibrous silky umbonate cap and adnexed gills. An all-lilac variety lilacina is also common.  Taxonomy and naming  It was first described in 1799 as Agaricus geophyllus by English naturalist James Sowerby in his work Coloured Figures of English Fungi or Mushrooms. Christiaan Hendrik Persoon spelt it Agaricus geophilus in his 1801 work Synopsis methodica fungorum. Its specific epithet is derived from the Ancient Greek terms geo- \\"earth\\", and phyllon \\"leaf\\". It was given its current binomial name in 1871 by Paul Kummer. A lilac form is known as var. lilacina; it was originally described as Agaricus geophyllus var. lilacinus by American mycologist Charles Horton Peck in 1872, who came across it in Bethlehem, New York. It was given its current name by Claude Casimir Gillet in 1876. It was classified as a separate species in 1918 by Calvin Henry Kauffman, who felt that it was consistently different and grew in different locales. However, the consensus is to maintain as a variety. However, a 2005 study of nuclear genes found that I. geophylla was closely related to I. fuscodisca, while I. lilacina came out as in a lineage with I. agglutinata and I. pudica.  Description  The cap is 1‚Äì4 cm (0.4‚Äì2.6 in) in diameter and white or cream- coloured with a silky texture, at first conical before flattening out to a more convex shape with a pronounced umbo (boss). The cap margins may split with age. The thin stipe is 1‚Äì6 cm (0.4‚Äì2.4 in) high and 0.3‚Äì0.6 cm thick and lacks a ring. It has a small bulb at the base, and often does not grow straight. The crowded gills are adnexed and cream early, before darkening to a brownish colour with the developing spores. The spore print is brown. The almond-shaped spores are smooth and measure around 9 √ó 5 Œºm. The faint smell has been likened to meal, damp earth, or even described as spermatic. The white or cream flesh has an acrid taste and does not change colour when cut or bruised. Larger mushrooms can be confused with members of the genus Tricholoma or the edible Calocybe gambosa, though these have a mealy smell and gills that remain white. In Israel, it is confused with edible mushrooms of the genus Tricholoma, particularly Tricholoma terreum, and Suillus granulatus, all of which grow in similar habitat. In North America it resembles mushrooms of the genus Camarophyllus. The variety lilacina is similar in shape but tinted lilac all over, with an ochre-brown flush on the cap umbo and the base of the stem. It has a strong mealy or earthy odour. This variety could be mistaken for the edible amethyst deceiver (Laccaria amethystina), although the latter species has a fibrous stipe, a fruity smell and lacks the ochre-coloured umbo. It is a similar coloration to the wood blewit, although mushrooms of that species generally grow much larger.  Distribution and habitat  I. geophylla var. lilacina (Peck) Gillet Inocybe geophylla is common and widespread across Europe and North America. In western North America it is found under live oak, pine and Douglas fir. Both varieties are found in the Canadian Arctic regions of northern Manitoba and North West Territories, with the nominate form found in dryish tundra heath communities composed of American dwarf birch (Betula glandulosa), Arctic willow (Salix arctica), dwarf willow (S. herbacea), polar willow (S. polaris ssp. pseudopolaris), snow willow (Salix reticulata), bog bilberry (Vaccinium uliginosum var. alpinum), lingonberry (V. vitis-idaea var. minus), alpine bearberry (Arctostaphylos alpina), alpine bistort (Persicaria vivipara), Arctic bell-heather (Cassiope tetragona) and northern white mountain avens (Dryas integrifolia) and var. lilacina in moist mossy tundra heaths, alongside such plants as American dwarf birch, snow willow, Arctic bell-heather and northern white mountain avens. It is mycorrhizal, the fruiting bodies are found in deciduous and coniferous woodlands in summer and autumn. Within these locations, fruiting bodies may be found in grassy areas and near pathways, or often on rich, bare soil that has been disturbed at roadsides, and near ditches. In Palestine, I. geophylla grows under Palestine oak (Quercus calliprinos) and pines, with mushrooms still appearing in periods of little or no rain as they are mycorrhizal. In Western Australia, Brandon Matheny and Neale Bougher (2005) pointed to collections of what was referred to as I. geophylla var. lilacina by some Australian taxonomists, as a misapplication of the name I. geophylla var. lilacina; the specimens have been reclassified as the species Inocybe violaceocaulis.  Toxicity  Like many fibrecaps, Inocybe geophylla contains muscarine. The symptoms are those of muscarine poisoning, namely, greatly increased salivation, perspiration (sweating), and lacrimation (tear flow) within 15‚Äì30 minutes of ingestion. With large doses, these symptoms may be followed by abdominal pain, severe nausea, diarrhea, blurred vision, and labored breathing. Intoxication generally subsides within two hours. Delirium does not occur. The specific antidote is atropine. Inducing vomiting to remove mushroom contents is also prudent due to the speed of onset of symptoms.Benjamin, p. 346‚Äì49. Death has not been recorded as a result of consuming this species. It is often ignored by mushroom hunters because of its small size.

Electric meters with NILM technology are used by utility companies to survey the specific uses of electric power in different homes. NILM is considered a low-cost alternative to attaching individual monitors on each appliance. It does, however, present privacy concerns. Background and theory Nonintrusive load monitoring was invented by George W. Hart, Ed Kern and Fred Schweppe of MIT in the early 1980s with funding from the Electric Power Research Institute.NALM bibliography 1980‚Äì1995 Figure 1 from US patent 4858141 showing basic process for NILM The basic process is described in . As shown in figure 1 from the patent, a digital AC monitor is attached to the single-phase power going into a residence. Changes in the voltage and current are measured (i.e. admittance measurement unit), normalized (scaler) and recorded (net change detector unit). A cluster analysis is then performed to identify when different appliances are turned on and off. If a 60-watt bulb is turned on, for example, followed by a 100-watt bulb being turned on, followed by the 60-watt bulb being turned off followed by the 100-watt bulb being turned off, the NIALM unit will match the on and off signals from the 60-watt bulb and the on and off signals from the 100-watt bulb to determine how much power was used by each bulb and when. The system is sufficiently sensitive that individual 60-watt bulbs can be discriminated due to the normal variations in actual power draw of bulbs with the same nominal rating (e.g. one bulb might draw 61 watts, another 62 watts). Figure 8 from US patent 4858141 showing how differences in reactive power can help distinguish one appliance from another The system can measure both reactive power and real power. Hence two appliances with the same total power draw can be distinguished by differences in their complex impedance. As shown in figure 8 from the patent, for example, a refrigerator electric motor and a pure resistive heater can be distinguished in part because the electric motor has significant changes in reactive power when it turns on and off, whereas the heater has almost none. NILM systems can also identify appliances with a series of individual changes in power draw. These appliances are modeled as finite state machines. A dishwasher, for example, has heaters and motors that turn on and off during a typical dish washing cycle. These will be identified as clusters, and power draw for the entire cluster will be recorded. Hence ‚Äúdishwasher‚Äù power draw can be identified as opposed to ‚Äúresistor heating unit‚Äù and ‚Äúelectric motor‚Äù. Applications *\\"Extremely cost-effective\\" load identification *Cheap detection of startup transients, line or equipment faults, etc. * Perform surveys of both residential and commercial energy consumption. * Demand response system for use on the smart grid. * Monitor systems on-board ships for safe systems operation with fewer sensors. Privacy concerns NILM can detect what types of appliances people have and their behavioral patterns. Patterns of energy use may indicate behavior patterns, such as routine times that nobody is at home, or embarrassing or illegal behavior of residents. It could, for example, reveal when the occupants of a house are using the shower, or when individual lights are turned on and off. If the NILM is running remotely at a utility or by a third party, the homeowner may not know that their behavior is being monitored and recorded. A stand-alone in-home system, under the control of the user, can provide feedback about energy use, without revealing information to others. Drawing links between their behavior and energy consumption may help reduce energy consumption, improve efficiency, flatten peak loads, save money, or balance appliance use with green energy availability. However the use of a stand-alone system does not protect one from remote monitoring. The accuracy and capability of this technology is still developing and is not 100% reliable in near-real-time, such that complete information is accumulated and analyzed over periods ranging from minutes to hours.

Reaching an estimated 43 million people through more than 400 newspapers throughout the United States, A Frank Statement to Cigarette Smokers and subsequent advertisements were designed by public relations firm Hill & Knowlton to socially engineer the public's perceptions of tobacco and to instill doubt about scientific research linking disease and smoking. As a result of A Frank Statement and tobacco advertisements that still exist today, the tobacco industry continues to expand its markets by avoiding health concerns and portraying its products in a positive light. Historical context Reports of a link between tobacco and lung cancer emerged as early as 1912, but until the 1950s, the evidence was circumstantial since smoking was so pervasive in society. In 1950, hoping to find the cause of the significant surge in lung cancer incidence in the US and England, Dr. Richard Doll and Professor Bradford Hill conducted a case-control study in which lung cancer, other cancer, and non-cancer patients from twenty London-area hospitals were interviewed about their smoking habits. The study, published in the British Medical Journal, found that the lung cancer patients were more likely to be heavier smokers than the other cancer and non-cancer control patients. These results revealed to the medical community that a link between smoking and lung cancer may exist. Smoking was so prevalent that before these results were published, the increase in lung cancer incidence was attributed to the growing presence of automobiles, roads, and factories in cities. Wynder and Graham's study found that lung cancer patients were more likely to be heavier smokers than the other cancer and non-cancer control patients. In 1950, Dr. Ernst Wynder and Evarts Ambrose Graham published a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association in which they interviewed 684 people with proven cases of lung cancer about their smoking habits. The study found that heavy and sustained usage of tobacco, especially in the form of cigarettes, increased the likelihood of developing of lung cancer. In 1952, to study the biological likelihood of cancer being linked to smoking, Wynder published an animal study in the US journal Cancer Research that found that tobacco tar was carcinogenic when applied to the skin of mice. The December 1952 issue of Reader's Digest featured an article, titled Cancer by the Carton, that discussed these recent studies on the link between smoking and lung cancer. The article presented to the public the studies' conclusion that tobacco causes lung cancer. As a result, the article provoked a health scare, which resulted in a small drop in consumption, and a fall in stock prices. In 1954, Doll and Hill published another article in the British Medical Journal releasing the results of the British Doctors Study, which revealed a significant pattern of increased death from lung cancer as the amount of tobacco smoked increased. In the early 1950s, which were the immediate post- war years and the beginning of the nuclear age, science was very highly regarded by the public, so the accumulating scientific evidence linking tobacco to lung cancer posed a major threat to the tobacco companies' public image.  Social engineering  With mounting evidence of a link between smoking tobacco and lung cancer, tobacco companies faced a dilemma of whether to admit to or deny the health risks of smoking. In order to preserve their industry, the tobacco companies opted to completely deny health risks. Instead, the tobacco companies crafted a strategy that, through creative advertising and marketing, would manipulate the cultural context surrounding their product from one that regarded the product unfavorably to one that held the product in high esteem. This strategy is known as social engineering. On December 15, 1953, led by Paul Hahn, the head of American Tobacco, the six major tobacco companies (American Tobacco Co., R. J. Reynolds, Philip Morris, Benson & Hedges, U.S. Tobacco Co., and Brown & Williamson) met with public relations company Hill & Knowlton in New York City to create an advertisement that would assuage the public's fears and create a false sense of security in order to regain the public's confidence in the tobacco industry. Hill and Knowlton's president, John W. Hill, realized that simply denying the health risks would not be enough to convince the public. Instead, a more effective method would be to create a major scientific controversy in which the scientifically established link between smoking tobacco and lung cancer would appear not to be conclusively known. The tobacco companies fought against the emerging science by producing their own science, which suggested that existing science was incomplete and that the industry was not motivated by self- interest. With the creation of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee, headed by accomplished scientist C.C. Little, the tobacco companies manufactured doubt and turned scientific findings into a topic of debate. The recruitment of credentialed scientists like Little who were skeptics was a crucial aspect of the tobacco companies' social engineering plan to establish credibility against anti-smoking reports. By amplifying the voices of a few skeptical scientists, the industry created an illusion that the larger scientific community had not reached a conclusive agreement on the link between smoking and cancer. Internal documents released through whistleblowers and litigation, such as the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement, reveal that while advertisements like A Frank Statement made tobacco companies appear to be responsible and concerned for the health of their consumers, in reality, they were deceiving the public into believing that smoking did not have health risks. The whole project was aimed at protecting the tobacco companies' images of glamour and all-American individualism at the cost of the public's health.Bates, Clive, and Andy Rowell. \\"Tobacco Explained\\" (PDF). World Health Organization. Claims A Frank Statement to Cigarette Smokers claims: # That medical research of recent years indicates many possible causes of lung cancer. # That there is no agreement among the authorities regarding what the cause is. # That there is no proof that cigarette smoking is one of the causes. # That statistics purporting to link cigarette smoking with the disease could apply with equal force to any one of many other aspects of modern life. Indeed, the validity of the statistics themselves is questioned by numerous scientists. The claims made in A Frank Statement were largely false as: # Recent medical research had indicated that while lung cancer does have many possible causes, smoking is by far the leading cause in many different types of cancer. # Most scientists, except for skeptics hired by the tobacco companies, agreed that cigarette smoking is linked to lung cancer incidence. # Multiple studies have shown a clear link between cigarette smoking and lung cancer. # The studies linking cigarette smoking to lung cancer controlled for the \\"many other aspects of modern life\\" to show that cigarette smoking is the main cause. Many of the \\"numerous scientists\\" who questioned the validity of the statistics were under the payroll of the tobacco companies. Promises The advertisement also made several promises on behalf of the tobacco industry which were later disputed by the scientific community. In A Frank Statement, the tobacco companies stated that they believed that their products were safe; however, in a 2002 assessment of the promises made by the advertisement, it was concluded that some tobacco industry scientists believed that there was a causal relationship between tobacco and cancer. Research was undertaken to find a safer cigarette, but tobacco companies realized that they could not produce a safer cigarette because doing so would mean admitting that current cigarettes were not safe. Thus, the industry responded to the growing public concern by marketing their cigarettes as having filters, milder smoke, and lower tar and nicotine content; however, they did not acknowledge a causal link with cancer until 1999. A Frank Statement also pledged \\"aid and assistance to the research effort into all phases of tobacco use and health,\\" and announced the establishment of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee (TIRC) to work towards that goal. Much of the TIRC funded research was not directly connected to smoking as it focused mainly on cancer basics, such as immunology, genetics, cell biology, pharmacology, and virology, rather than cancer's connection to smoking. Neither the TIRC nor its successor, the Council for Tobacco Research, ever acknowledged a proven link between smoking and serious and/or life-threatening illness. When research did find a link between smoking and cancer, however, the findings were rarely reported to the public. Despite the irrelevance of much of the TIRC funded research to the health effects of smoking, the tobacco industry continued to publicize its funding of the TIRC to reassure the public. In reality, the TIRC was created as a public relations measure for the purposes of discrediting independent science and portraying the tobacco companies as transparent and concerned for the well-being of their customers. Finally, the advertisement promised that the tobacco companies \\"always have and always will cooperate closely with those whose task it is to safeguard the public health.\\" According to Cummings, Morley, and Hyland, \\"there is abundant evidence that the tobacco industry went to great lengths to undermine tobacco control efforts of the public health community.\\" An example of this is a memo from the vice-president of the Tobacco Institute in which the industry's strategy was described as \\"creating doubt about the health charge without actually denying it\\", and \\"advocating the public's right to smoke, without actually urging them to take up the practice.\\" By proclaiming that the health risks were not conclusively linked to smoking, the tobacco companies manipulated the situation to place all liability on the consumer rather than on themselves.  Impact on the public  Although the tobacco industry claims that their advertising is only used to convince current smokers to switch between brands and that it does not increase total cigarette consumption, research into the effects of advertising shows that it plays an essential role in projecting positive connotations of smoking cigarettes onto potential new smokers. From 1954, when Hill & Knowlton first started working with the tobacco industry, to 1961, the number of cigarettes sold annually rose from 369 billion to 488 billion, and the annual per capita consumption rose from 3344 to 4025 cigarettes. The first cigarette advertisements claimed that smoking cigarettes had a variety of health benefits, such as prolonged youth, thinness, and attractiveness. However, as more research revealed the deceptiveness of these claims, tobacco companies began to use advertisements, like A Frank Statement, to deny that their products caused cancer. Claiming that advertisement bans would infringe on \\"commercial free speech,\\" the tobacco industry has continually fought against them; however, the industry has never responded to criticism that much of its advertising, like the claims made in A Frank Statement, is deceptive. As a result, the tobacco industry's manipulation of science as a public relations tactic is still used today in debates on a wide variety of subjects including global warming, food, and pharmaceuticals.  Modern-day examples  Today, tobacco companies continue to aggressively advertise cigarettes. As cigarette consumption has declined in the United States, tobacco companies have greatly increased their advertising expenditure. In 1991, the industry spent $4.6 billion on advertising and promoting cigarette consumption, and in 2015, tobacco companies spent $8.9 billion on advertising just in the United States. Tobacco companies continue to use this money to fund social engineering techniques, such as campaigns featuring themes of social desirability and specific cultural references, to target women, children, and specific racial/ethnic communities. For example, to make cigarettes appealing to African American communities, the industry has implemented campaigns that use urban culture and language while sponsoring Chinese and Vietnamese New Year festivals to target Asian Americans. With declining levels of smoking in the West due to smoking bans and increased education on the health risks of smoking, tobacco companies have also expanded their market into developing countries to fulfill the industry's ever-present need for new smokers and more money. Using many of the same advertising techniques of glamour, sex, and independence, the industry has begun to target women and children in Eastern Europe, Asia, Latin America, and Africa, where government bans and health education may not be as prevalent.

Another of Mihr 'Ali's paintings of Fat'h Ali Shah Qajar, now in the collection of the Golestan Palace. Mihr 'Ali (Persian: ŸÖŸáÿ± ÿπŸÑ€å ŸÜŸÇÿßÿ¥; fl. 1795-post 1830) (also spelt Mir Ali or Mehr Ali) was one of the great royal painters of the Persian court during the reign of Fat'h Ali Shah Qajar, and is regarded as the most notable Persian portraitist of the early part of this reign.http://www.sothebys.com/app/live/lot/LotDetail.jsp?lot_id=159545074 Mihr Ali was one of the foremost painters of the early period of Qajar art. Mihr 'Ali's chief skill was his ability to capture the portrait-sitter's grandeur and power, and as such he became a favourite painter of the Shah. Mihr 'Ali produced at least ten full-size oil paintings of Fat'h Ali Shah, one of the earliest of which was probably sent as a present to the amirs of Sind in 1800. A further portrait, of the Shah enthroned, was sent to Napoleon. Mihr Ali's finest portrait is an 1813‚Äì4 work, regarded by some as the finest Persian oil painting in existence.http://www.answers.com/topic/mihr-ali-2 It shows a full- length portrait of the King wearing a gold brocade robe and a royal crown, holding a jewelled staff. Fat'h Ali Shah commissioned great numbers of lifesize portraits of himself and his sons, works which formed the backdrop to court ceremonies. The works, painted by Mihr 'Ali and his predecessor as court painter, Mirza Baba, portrayed Fat'h Ali Shah in his manyb stately roles, and were intended to show his power as a ruler rather than to be realistic portraits. As a result, the works are heavily stylised, are painted in rich, deep tones, and are filled with symbols of power. Other important works by Mehr 'Ali include a series of portraits of Persian rulers and figures from the Shahnameh, commissioned by Fat'h Ali Shah as decoration for the 'Imarat-i Naw Palace in Isfahan. This series of works was notable enough to be mentioned in the reports of many of the European travellers to Isfahan, such as James Morier (in A Journey through Persia in the years 1808 and 1809, published in 1812), Sir William Ouseley in 1812 (in Travels into various Countries of the East, published in 1823), and Charles Texier (in Description de l'Arm√©nie, la Perse et la Mesopotamie, published in 1852). Until 1985, it was thought that all of the paintings in this series had been destroyed, but three have since been discovered and authenticated, those being portraits of Afrasiyab, Genghis Khan, and Kay Khusraw, though the Kay Khusraw portrait does not exist in its full form but has been reduced to only some 80% of its original size. Despite this, it sold at auction at Christie's in London in 2007 for ¬£54,000 ($US 107,500).http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=4892532 The other two works are also in private hands, having been auctioned by the same company in 1987. Mihr 'Ali was also a capable teacher, his pupils including the noted painter Abul-Hasan Ghaffari.

History Financial Supervisory system in S. Korea prior to FSS Before the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) was established, Korea's financial supervisory system was largely fragmented, with the banking, securities, insurance, and non-bank sectors individually managed and regulated by a separate agency. Furthermore, the authority of supervision was split between two governing entities, i.e. the supervisory agencies and the Ministry of Finance and Economy (formerly known as the Ministry of Finance; currently the Ministry of Strategy and Finance). Under this segregated supervisory system, the banking sector was overseen by the Bank of Korea and the ministry, the securities sector by the Securities Supervisory Board and the ministry, and the insurance sector by the Insurance Supervisory Board and the ministry. As to non-bank financial institutions established after the 1970s, the overall authority lay with the ministry while functions of examination were delegated to the Banking Supervisory Authority within the Bank of Korea and the Korea Non-Bank Deposit Insurance Corporation. Establishment of Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) The end of the 1980s marked a time of diversification in the financial industry and businesses‚Äô crossover into other financial sectors. Meanwhile, the financial environment changed considerably with the opening of markets to foreign investments and the ongoing march of globalization. This led to an increasing number of complex financial transactions ‚Äì such as derivatives ‚Äì that blurred the boundaries of banking, securities, and insurance. The multifarious financial supervisory system of the past, in which the banking, securities, and insurance sectors were each regulated by their respective supervisory agencies, was no longer fit to address the innovations in the financial environment. As a result, the government established the Presidential Committee on Financial Reform in 1997, which announced a final report detailing the following recommendations for reform of the financial supervisory system: * Consolidation of the existing supervisory agencies into one organization to better deal with market liberalization, business expansion into other financial sectors, and the rising uncertainty in the market; * Establishment of an autonomous financial supervisory authority independent from macroeconomic, monetary and credit policies; * Proper distribution of responsibilities and strengthened cooperation among related agencies Following the guidelines set forth by the committee's report, the government drafted financial reform bills in August 1997. Based on a recommendation by the International Monetary Fund to establish an integrated financial supervisory body, the National Assembly passed the bill on December 29, 1997. On April 1, 1998, the Financial Supervisory Commission (the predecessor to the Financial Services Commission) was launched as the FSS's supreme decision- making body, laying the groundwork for the consolidation of the four supervisory bodies (the Banking Supervisory Authority, Securities Supervisory Board, Insurance Supervisory Board, and the Non-bank Deposit Insurance Corporation. To preserve sectoral characteristics while flexibly addressing businesses‚Äô branching into other sectors, a committee of executives and staff from the four supervisory bodies was put together to work out a plan for the consolidated agency. On January 2, 1999, the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) was finally established. Major progress The consolidation of the financial supervisory system helped Korea to quickly and efficiently recover from the Asian financial crisis that broke out at the end of 1997. The FSS led an intensive restructuring of the financial industry, eliminating insolvent financial companies and putting the financial system back on track. Over a six-year period extending from 1998 to 2003, 840 financial companies ‚Äì including 14 banks ‚Äì were removed from the market through M&As;, P&As;, or liquidation. To combat increased corporate insolvency resulting from the Asian financial crisis, the FSS successfully headed a corporate restructuring drive that implemented a series of measures like the improvement of conglomerates‚Äô financial structure, liquidation of failing companies, and workout program. The FSS also reacted expeditiously to the credit card crunch and market distress of 2003 ‚Äì caused by excessive credit card business expansion ‚Äì by strengthening prudent supervision of credit card companies and encouraging the development of M&As; in order to prevent uncertainty from spreading throughout the financial market. The integrated supervisory agency also facilitated a systematic application and supervision of programs introduced in the aftermath of the crisis, such as forward-looking criteria (FLC), a system of financial holding companies, and the retirement pension plan. In enforcing prudent regulations such as prompt corrective action, business management evaluation, and capital adequacy ratio, it was also able to coordinate and maintain equity across financial sectors. Purpose Purpose The purpose of the Financial Supervisory Service is to contribute to the growth of the national economy by 1) promoting the advancement of the financial industry and the stability of financial markets; 2) establishing sound credit order and fair financial transaction practices; and 3) protecting financial consumers, such as depositors. (Article 1, Act on the Establishment, etc. of Financial Services Commission) Legal status The FSS was established for a special purpose and is legally based on the Act on the Establishment, etc. of Financial Services Commission. It administers public affairs independent from the central and regional governments of Korea. The intended effect of its legal status as an independent public entity rather than a governmental operation is twofold: 1) to minimize government interference of the FSS's supervision of financial institutions; and 2) to ensure a fair and independent execution of its supervisory services. Management and Structure Executives (as of May 14, 2012) Its current governor Kwon Hyouk-Se was named to his position in March 2011 after a career of nearly three decades in finance-related positions in the government, including with the Ministry of Finance and Economy(Mofe, predecessor to the Ministry of Strategy and Finance, and the Financial Services Commission. :Kwon Hyouk-Se, Governor :Park Soo Won, Chief Executive Auditor :Choi Soo Hyun, First Senior Deputy Governor :Ho Joong Kim, Chief Accountant Organizational structure (as of June 13, 2012)Organization in FSS english website  The FSS headquarters in Seoul has 38 departments, and 13 offices. Regional offices are in operation in Busan, Daegu, Gwangju, and Daejeon, and representative offices in Jeonju, Chuncheon, Chungju, and Jeju. The FSS is also present in New York, London, Tokyo, and Beijing, and has residing staff in Washington D.C., Frankfurt and Hong Kong.FSS Web site www.fss.or.kr The FSS established Financial Consumer Protection Agency directly reporting to and under the supervision of the Governor on May 15, 2012, independent of supervision and examination divisions. Deliberation and advisory committees =Financial Disputes Settlement Committee= Pursuant to Article 51 of the Act on the Establishment, etc. of Financial Services Commission, the Financial Disputes Settlement Committee is a quasi-judicial body established within the FSS to promptly and fairly resolve financial disputes among users of financial institutions. When a user of or a party concerned with a financial institution applies for a settlement of a dispute, the committee will, depending on the nature of dispute, either recommend the parties involved to reach an agreement or deliberate to resolve the dispute upon verification of facts. The committee is composed of up to 30 members, including an FSS deputy governor who serves as the committee chairman. Other members of the committee include assistant deputy governors of the FSS and specialists representing the legal profession, customer groups, financial sectors, academia, and other relevant sectors. As an out-of-court dispute resolution body, the Financial Disputes Settlement Committee assumes a voluntary role in dispute mediation. However, when both parties to a dispute accept a mediator's proposal, the proposal carries the same effect as an in- court settlement. In this sense, the functions performed by the committee can be said to be quasi-judicial. (Section 5 ‚ÄúMediation of Financial Disputes,‚Äù Act on the Establishment, etc. Of Financial Services Commission) =Sanctions Review Committee= The Sanctions Review Committee advises the Governor of the FSS regarding deliberation of sanctions pursuant to the Regulations on Examination and Sanctions of Financial Institutions. Charged with deliberating a variety of possible sanctions instituted by the Financial Services Commission and/or the Governor of the Financial Supervisory Service, whether against a business' operations or employees, or financial sanctions, the committee is operated to ensure the fairness and equity of sanction measures. The committee is composed of nine members: head and deputy head of sanctions deliberation, head of case presentation, FSS legal advisor (these four members are internal members), FSC representative in charge of case presentation, and four external members chosen from among lawyers, professors, and/or financial experts with professional knowledge of finance-related statutes or scholarship and experience in finance. The three external members are appointed by the Governor of the FSS. Meetings of the committee shall be convened whenever a majority of its members deems it necessary, and resolutions are passed by majority consent of all attending members.Article 55 of 'Regulation on Examination and Sanction Against Financial Insituion' Major Functions FSS acts as the executive supervisor for the FSC and principally carries out examination of financial institutions along with enforcement and other oversight activities as directed or charged by the FSC. * Supervision of financial institutions: (Preliminary) review of license applications (for bank, non-bank, financial investment company, insurance company, credit card company, financial holding company, or any other kind of financial institution), review of the terms and conditions of financial institutions; supervision of the soundness of business management and business activities * Examination of financial institutions: Analysis and evaluation of financial companies‚Äô business activities, financial position, and risk management capacity; verification of companies‚Äô compliance with relevant statutes * Supervision of the capital market: Operation of disclosure system to maintain the sound operation of primary and secondary markets for marketable securities; capital market investigation to prevent unfair trade practices * Supervision of accounting: Alignment of accounting standards to international accounting standards to achieve enhanced transparency; supervision of accounting to ensure a fair operation of the external audit system * Protection of customers of financial services: Consultation and handling of customer complaints regarding financial services; protection of customer rights through dispute mediation; financial education of consumers External Relations Financial Services Commission The Financial Services Commission (FSC) is a central public administration agency falling under the jurisdiction of the Office of the Prime Minister, and is charged with the deliberation and determination of financial policies and other important matters of financial supervision ‚Äì such as the supervision, examination, and sanctioning of financial institutions, and authorization and licensing of financial institutions. Pursuant to the relevant legal provisions, the FSC may direct and supervise the operations of the FSS. In addition to its inherent responsibilities of supervising and sanctioning financial institutions, the FSS supports the operations of the FSC and its adjoined Securities & Futures Commission, and executes those FSC duties which are entrusted by the FSC to the FSS. (Article 37, Act on the Establishment, etc. of Financial Services Commission) Prior to February 2008, the law provided that the Chairman of the Financial Supervisory Commission (the predecessor to the Financial Services Commission) be concurrently appointed as the Governor of the FSS, with the FSS directly assisting the operations of the commission. The revision of the Act in February 2008 clearly distinguishes the policy-making function of the FSC and the supervisory enforcement function of FSS, and provides that different persons be assigned to head each organization to ensure more effective checks and balances (Article 29 (2) of the Act). The revision also provides that the Governor of FSS may, as an ex-officio member of the FSC, request to the FSC chairman that matters necessary within the scope of FSS operation be included in the commission's agenda.See \\"National Assembly Strategy & Finance Committee's Investigation Report,\\" Legal Knowledge Information System of the National Assembly Bank of Korea The Bank of Korea may, when the Monetary Policy Committee deems it necessary for the implementation of monetary and credit policies, request the FSS to perform an examination of a bank and/or other financial institutions, or ask that its staff jointly participate in an FSS-led examination. The Bank of Korea may also request the FSS to send the result of examination and ask for certain necessary corrective measures based on the results. When the FSC takes measures that are directly related to monetary and/or credit policies, the Bank of Korea may ask for reconsideration of the measures if it has any objections. Following the September 2009 signing of the memorandum of understanding (MOU) on information sharing and joint examination among the FSS, the Bank of Korea, the Ministry of Strategy and Finance, the FSC, and the Korea Deposit Insurance Corporation, the FSS and the Bank of Korea agreed to widen the range of information shared between the entities and increase cooperation to promptly execute joint examinations for emergency cases. FSS signs a memorandum of understanding on information sharing and joint examination with FSC, BOK, and KDIC. Korea Deposit Insurance Corporation The Korea Deposit Insurance Corporation may, when deemed necessary for its operation, request the FSS to perform an examination of insured financial companies or ask that its staff jointly participate in an FSS-led examination. Based on the aforementioned MOU, the Korea Deposit Insurance Corporation and FSS share the financial information of financial companies with each other. Korea Asset Management Corporation The FSC supervises the Korea Asset Management Corporation (KAMCO), gives directives in relation to its supervision, and receives reports from the corporation on its operations, accounting, and assets. Under instruction of the FSC, the Governor of the FSS may examine the operations, accounting, and assets of KAMCO. Current Issues Early recovery from the crisis Even before the breakout of the financial crisis, the key policy objective of the FSS was to stabilize the financial market and enhance the health and soundness of Korea's financial institutions. During the recent period of credit expansion, the FSS took a series of strengthened measures of prudency such as Loan-to-Value (LTV) and Debt-to-Income DTI regulations in March 2006 and the 30% rule restricting savings banks‚Äô project finance (PF) loans in August 2006. From August 2007, when the sub-prime mortgage crisis emerged in the United States, the FSS established and operated a comprehensive monitoring system to track new market developments. In September 2008, amid rising distress in global financial markets in the wake of the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the FSS committed itself to market stabilization to ensure an early recovery from the crisis. It operated a round-the-clock monitoring system that was linked with its offices overseas, government agencies, and financial institutions, while closely coordinating policies with the relevant organizations to promptly deal with potential instability factors. The FSS also established a contingency examination system that required its examination competence to focus on preventing systemic risks; its on-site general examination functions were deferred to accommodate the screening of potential risks. In October 2008, the FSS set up the Foreign Debt Service Guarantee Task Force, thereby working to quickly recover the finance sector's intermediary role by improving banks‚Äô liquidity ratio and helping to ease the domestic and foreign liquidity crunch faced by local companies. To prevent bad loans from accumulating, the FSS urged banks to maintain a Bank for International Settlements (BIS) ratio of 12% or higher and a Tier 1 capital ratio of 9% or higher as of end of 2008. The financial crisis was also an opportunity to crack down on unsound business practices that contributed to increased volatility in the foreign currency and stock markets. To ward off unwarranted concerns that served to undermine market confidence, the FSS regularly organized conference calls and issue briefings for domestic and international institutional investors and analysts, as well as briefings for the foreign press. Corporate restructuring The expiration of the old Corporate Restructuring Promotion Act at the end of 2005 highlighted the need to address the limitations of creditor banks‚Äô sole discretion over corporate restructuring. As a result, the new Corporate Restructuring Promotion Act was enacted in November 2007. After the fall of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 and the resulting shortage of liquidity and economic recession, industries particularly susceptible to global economic cycles ‚Äì such as construction, shipbuilding, and shipping ‚Äì were in dire need of restructuring. In November 2008, the FSS organized the Corporate Credit Task Force in a joint FSS-FSC undertaking to ease businesses‚Äô financial distress and improve their financial position. In December of the same year, the FSS announced directives and policies for major corporate restructuring.[11] From January to April 2009, credit risk evaluations were conducted on construction companies, shipbuilders, and shipping companies faced with solvency risks. Based on the results of the evaluations, 46 companies were placed on a corporate workout procedure. By the end of September 2009, six of the companies had been normalized, 17 were still undergoing the workout, and 23 were in the process of court receivership. Subsequent to the industry-specific restructuring drive, the FSS also initiated a restructuring process for the corporate sector at large. Large individual companies with outstanding credit lines of 50 billion won or more were subjected to credit risk evaluations; of 433 companies, 33 were selected for restructuring. By the end of September 2009, three had completed the workout program, 13 were in the process of normalizing their operations through workout, and 17 were in the process of court receivership program. Given the large number of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and the limited availability of information on which to determine restructuring, SME credit risk evaluations were performed in different stages based on the size of credit loans. In July 2009, the first round of evaluations screened 861 companies that were subject to external audits and had in excess of 5 billion won in debt; of them, 113 were selected for restructuring. In the second round of evaluations that ended in September 2009, 1,461 companies subject to external audits and carrying 3 billion won or more in debts were screened, of which 174 were ordered to restructure. In the third round of evaluations that ended in December 2009, companies subject to external audits with debts of 1 billion won or more and those not subject to external audits but with debts of 3 billion won or more were screened; of the 1,842 companies screened, 225 were selected to undergo restructuring. Microfinance and SME support In an effort to assist with the financial needs of low-income groups severely hit by the global financial crisis, the FSS launched the Microfinance 119 Service (s119.fss.or.kr) on its portal website in March 2009. The website was designed to offer microfinance information and other related services to low-income earners. The portal website offers eight services, including loan information, free credit checks, information on voice phishing fraud, checks on legally established financial institutions, financial knowledge, credit recovery programs, rehabilitation support programs, and reports of illegal financial practices. To ensure that the services can be accessed from a wider range of channels ‚Äì for the convenience of service users ‚Äì the FSS linked its portal service to the websites of 370 financial institutions. The Microfinance 119 Service extended individually tailored loans to 33,000 customers, absorbing 14.2 billion won of illegal private loans into the established market in the process. The portal also contributed to promoting the Hope Loan program, offered in cooperation with financial institutions. From March 1, 2009 to December 4, 2009, 201,774 customers with low credit ratings or low income levels received a combined total of 1.18 trillion won in loans through the program. (FSS's Microfinance 119 Service website) The FSS also took a series of measures to strengthen the lines of support to small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in times of liquidity shortage during the global financial crisis. Working jointly with the Korea Federation of Banks and other organizations, the FSS introduced the SME Fast Track program in October 2008, injecting a combined liquidity of 2.82 trillion won to 1,672 SMEs by the end of 2008. By coordinating policies with the FSC and other relevant agencies, and enlisting the active cooperation of the financial sector, the FSS helped to increase the guarantee amount from guarantee institutions and to extend the maturity of SME loans. Thanks to the combination of SME support measures, SME loans increased by 52.4 trillion won in 2008 ‚Äì despite the bleak economic circumstances of the global financial crisis ‚Äì which is comparable with the average increase of 56.7 trillion won in 2006 and 2007. Supervisory Objectives  The FSS is geared to emphasize on- site supervision and examinations in its commitment to establishing itself as financial regulator that markets and consumers trust. The FSS will strengthen prudential supervision to prevent worsening economic and financial conditions from leading to financial distress in companies. The FSS will provide more financial support for low-income people and SMEs, particularly vulnerable to economic recession, and concentrate on strengthening consumer protection. The FSS is hosting such regular events as Heart-to-Heart TalkWorkshop participated by consumer groups, financial companies and the FSS to share thoughts and Campus Talk on FinanceForum for communication among college students, financial regulator and professionals in its efforts to share thoughts and increase direct communication with financial consumers and markets. The FSS has set up five objectives for this year's supervisory guidelines and they are as follows. 1.Stabilizing Financial System In its efforts to better brace for worsening global and domestic conditions including euro-zone debt crisis, the FSS will strengthen foreign currency liquidity management and encourage financial companies to have more ability to absorb losses by setting aside more loan loss provisions. 2.Protecting Financial Consumers The FSS will earthen unreasonable practices embedded across the financial sector to correct them, and conduct more mystery shopping for five financial instruments Funds, variable insurance, ELS, Wrap, credit cards that frequently incur losses to consumers. 3.Protecting Low-income People and SMEs The FSS will intensify crackdown on illegal financial acts against low-income people and help reduce financial difficulties of SMEs by creating a level playing field between large companies and SMEs. 4.Innovating Supervisory System Financial companies will be encouraged to bring their corporate governance in line with global standards and place a high premium on corporate social responsibility. The FSS will help attract global financial companies to domestic market and give support to domestic companies making inroads into global markets. 5.Open-minded Communications with Market Players The FSS will press ahead with a comprehensive overhaul of the supervisory framework and better communication with consumers to restore confidence.

In a review for the Times Higher Education Supplement (London),Harry Gensler, Times Higher Education Supplement, February 25, 2000 Harry Gensler, Professor of philosophy, at John Carroll University, Cleveland, describes the book: :\\"The book has 101 humorous little stories, each with a philosophical problem (not however, necessarily, the usual Unsolved problems in philosophy). For example, problem 54 is about Mr Megasoft, who dies leaving his fortune to his favourite computer. Megasoft's children take the matter to court, contending that the computer cannot think and so cannot inherit money. Mr Megasoft's lawyers claim that the computer can think. But on what grounds can we say that computers can or cannot think?\\" Other stories deal with paradoxes, ethics, aesthetics, perception, time, God, physics, and knowledge and include problems from Zeno, Descartes, Russell, Nelson Goodman, Edmund Gettier and others. The problems are followed by a discussion section and a glossary. Reception In a review for The Philosopher, Dr. Zenon Stavrinides says that: :\\"Both in regard to its structure and the style in which it is written, it is very unconventional. The first part of the book consists of a series of very short stories or narrative texts, grouped by subject-matter, setting out problems or puzzles of philosophical interest. Some of these problems are well-known in philosophical literature, e.g. the paradox of Epimenides the Cretan, who said: 'All Cretans are liars'. In the second part of the book, entitled 'Discussions', Cohen provides explanations and analyses of the issues raised by each of the problems, with some references to the treatment offered by particular historical philosophers. These discussions are intelligent and balanced, if (in most cases at least) inevitably inconclusive.\\" 101 Philosophy Problems has been reviewed in The Philosophers Magazine by Julian Baggini (Summer 1999); the Ilkley Gazette (May 29, 1999 ); The Guardian (5.11.1999);\\"This week: five books of philosophy, to save you the burden of reading them.\\" Guardian [London, England] 5 Nov. 1999: 16.

Biography  Jimena was the daughter of Diego Fern√°ndez, Count of Oviedo and son of Count Fernando Fla√≠nez, and his wife Cristina. She was a sister of Fernando D√≠az. Upon marrying Rodrigo D√≠az, Jimena D√≠az accompanied her husband although it has remained unclear if she lived with him in the Taifa of Zaragoza during his first exile (from 1080-1086) as leader of the Andalusian army in service of Ahmah al-Muqtadir, Yusuf al-Mu'taman ibn Hud, and Al- Mustain II. There is also little historical certainty as to whether she moved with him in this period to Asturias, although there exists some documentation to suggest that she maintained a presence even during periods of separation (a legal action from Tol in 1083). At the beginning of the second exile of the Cid, in 1089, Jimena was imprisoned with her children, Cristina, Diego and Mar√≠a by mandate of Alfonso VI of Le√≥n and Castile. Nothing else is known about Jimena until the end of 1094, when Rodrigo D√≠az, on October 21, winning the battle of Cuarte, secured his control over Valencia (that he had conquered on June 17 of that year) and she was reunited with her husband until his death in 1099. From this point she was Lady of Valencia until 1102 when Alfonso VI, her kinsman, decided to set fire to and abandon the city to the Almoravids in response to the impossibility of defending it. Alfonso VI escorted Jimena in her return to Castile. Around this period there remains a document of donation made by Jimena D√≠az to the Cathedral of Valencia in 1101 containing her signature.Modern sculptures representing Jimena and her husband In 1103 she signed a document in the Monastery of San Pedro of Carde√±a for the sale of a monastery that she owned to two canons of Burgos, although this fact does not mean that Jimena would have lived in the abbey during her old age, as was the legend maintained by the monastery until the 18th century in the hagiographic texts known as The Legend of Carde√±a. It is more likely that she lived her last years in Burgos or in a nearby outlying area. She died sometime between August 29 of 1113 and 1116, probably in that final year. Of her three children, Diego was killed in battle fighting under Alfonso VI in 1097, Cristina married Ramiro S√°nchez of Monz√≥n and became mother of king Garc√≠a Ram√≠rez of Navarre, while Maria was successively wife of a prince of Arag√≥n and Ramon Berenguer III, Count of Barcelona. Burial Tomb of Do√±a Jimena and her husband Jimena and her husband were buried at San Pedro de Carde√±a. After tombs were ransacked during the Napoleonic Wars, they were reburied in Burgos, and they now rest in Burgos Cathedral.

Biography Philippe Suchard was born in 1797 in Boudry. Six years later he started as an apprentice in his brother Fr√©d√©ric's Konditorei in Bern. In 1824 he left Switzerland to visit the United States, writing a book about his experiences. At the end of the year he returned and opened a confectioner's business in Neuch√¢tel. Chocolat Suchard In 1826, Suchard opened the factory of Chocolat Suchard in Serri√®res, Neuch√¢tel. He used hydropower of the nearby river to run the mills in his two-man factory. Suchard used a grinding mill consisting of a heated granite plate, and several granite rollers moving forwards and backwards. This design is still used to grind cocoa paste. Chocolate was not cheap or a product for everybody. Suchard struggled financially early in his career as a chocolatier. His success came in 1842, with a bulk order from Frederick William IV, king of Prussia, who was also the prince of Neuch√¢tel. This triggered a boom and soon his chocolates won prizes at the London Great Exhibition of 1851 and the Paris Universal Exposition of 1855. By the end of the 19th century, Suchard had become the largest chocolate producer. Other interests Suchard's house in Neuch√¢tel built in 1865 by architect Louis-Daniel Perrier, inspired by his trip to the Middle East Suchard was not only a chocolatier but also had interest in other areas. In 1834 he introduced and captained the first steamer, Industriel, on Lake Neuch√¢tel. His interest in managing river water and controlling floods led to the sinking of the water level in Lake Neuch√¢tel. The lowered lake shoreline revealed the Celtic settlement of La T√®ne dating back to around 450 BC. He also tried introducing silkworm culture in Switzerland in 1837, but the silkworms were destroyed during an epidemic in 1843. As a result of his travels in the Middle East, he had an addition to his home built, topping it with minarets. Suchard's legacy Caisse Contenants of the Russ-Suchard & Cie, issued 4. March 1890 After Philippe's death in 1884 in Neuch√¢tel, his daughter Eug√©nie Suchard and her husband Karl Russ-Suchard, took over the functioning of his factory. Carl Russ-Suchard opened the first Suchard factory abroad in 1880 in L√∂rrach, Germany. In 1901, the company introduced the famous Milka chocolate for the Swiss market. Carl Russ-Suchard combined an unusual purple packaging with a cow symbolizing their use of milk. Nearly a century later, a survey in the 1990s reported that more than half the children in German preschools believed that cows were purple. In 1970, Suchard and Tobler combined to form Interfood. In 1982, Interfood was acquired by Klaus Johann Jacobs, and became part of the company Jacobs Suchard. In 1987, the Suchard company acquired 66% of the shares of the C√¥te d'Or chocolate company. In 1990, Philip Morris announced that they would buy Jacobs Suchard. In 1993, Philip Morris combined Kraft General Foods Europe and Jacobs Suchard AG, renaming it Kraft Jacobs Suchard. It spun off its chocolate and confectionery brands as Mondelez International as of 2012. The Suchard factory in the Serri√®res Valley is no longer used for production. Mondelez moved production to the Toblerone factory in Bern in the 1990s. In 2015, Mondelez opened a new production line for Milka and Suchard chocolates at its plant in Bludenz, Austria.

It is the simplest aromatic aldehyde and one of the most industrially useful. It is a colorless liquid with a characteristic almond-like odor. The primary component of bitter almond oil, benzaldehyde can be extracted from a number of other natural sources.Scott, Howard R. and Scott, Lillian E. (1920) \\"Process of treating nut kernels to produce food ingredients\\". Synthetic benzaldehyde is the flavoring agent in imitation almond extract, which is used to flavor cakes and other baked goods. History Benzaldehyde was first extracted in 1803 by the French pharmacist Martr√®s. His experiments focused on elucidating the nature of amygdalin, the poisonous material found in bitter almonds, the fruit of Prunus dulcis.In 1803 C. Martr√®s published a manuscript on the oil of bitter almonds: \\"Recherches sur la nature et le si√®ge de l'amertume et de l'odeur des amandes am√®res\\" (Research on the nature and location of the bitterness and the smell of bitter almonds). However, the memoir was largely ignored until an extract was published in 1819: Martr√®s fils (1819) \\"Sur les amandes am√®res,\\" Journal de Pharmacie, vol. 5, pages 289‚Äì296. Further work on the oil by Pierre Robiquet and Antoine Boutron-Charlard, two French chemists, produced benzaldehyde.Nouvelles exp√©riences sur les amandes am√®res et sur l'huile volatile qu'elles fournissent Robiquet, Boutron-Charlard, Annales de chimie et de physique, 44 (1830), 352‚Äì382, In 1832, Friedrich W√∂hler and Justus von Liebig first synthesized benzaldehyde.  Production  As of 1999, 7000 tonnes of synthetic and 100 tonnes of natural benzaldehyde were produced annually. Liquid phase chlorination and oxidation of toluene are the main routes. Numerous other methods have been developed, such as the partial oxidation of benzyl alcohol, alkali hydrolysis of benzal chloride, and the carbonylation of benzene.Br√ºhne, Friedrich and Wright, Elaine (2002) ‚ÄúBenzaldehyde‚Äù in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. A significant quantity of natural benzaldehyde is produced from cinnamaldehyde obtained from cassia oil by the retro-aldol reaction: the cinnamaldehyde is heated in an aqueous/alcoholic solution between 90 ¬∞C and 150 ¬∞C with a base (most commonly sodium carbonate or bicarbonate) for 5 to 80 hours,Wienes, Charles and Pittet, Alan O. (1985) Process for preparing natural benzaldehyde and acetaldehyde, natural benzaldehyde and acetaldehyde compositions, products produced thereby and organoleptic utilities therefor. followed by distillation of the formed benzaldehyde. This reaction also yields acetaldehyde. The natural status of benzaldehyde obtained in this way is controversial. \\"Site-specific nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy\\", which evaluates 1H/2H isotope ratios, has been used to differentiate between naturally occurring and synthetic benzaldehyde. Occurrence Benzaldehyde and similar chemicals occur naturally in many foods. Most of the benzaldehyde that people eat is from natural plant foods, such as almonds. Almonds, apricots, apples, and cherry kernels contain significant amounts of amygdalin. This glycoside breaks up under enzyme catalysis into benzaldehyde, hydrogen cyanide and two equivalents of glucose. Benzaldehyde contributes to the scent of oyster mushrooms (Pleurotus ostreatus).  Reactions  Benzaldehyde can be oxidized to benzoic acid; in fact \\"[B]enzaldehyde readily undergoes autoxidation to form benzoic acid on exposure to air at room temperature\\" causing a common impurity in laboratory samples. Since the boiling point of benzoic acid is much higher than that of benzaldehyde, it may be purified by distillation. Benzyl alcohol can be formed from benzaldehyde by means of hydrogenation. Reaction of benzaldehyde with anhydrous sodium acetate and acetic anhydride yields cinnamic acid, while alcoholic potassium cyanide can be used to catalyze the condensation of benzaldehyde to benzoin. Benzaldehyde undergoes disproportionation upon treatment with concentrated alkali (Cannizzaro reaction): one molecule of the aldehyde is reduced to the benzyl alcohol and another molecule is simultaneously oxidized to benzoic acid. :Cannizzaro reaction With diols, including many sugars, benzaldehyde condenses to form benzylidene acetals.  Uses  Benzaldehyde is commonly employed to confer almond flavor to foods and scented products. It is sometimes used in cosmetics products. In industrial settings, benzaldehyde is used chiefly as a precursor to other organic compounds, ranging from pharmaceuticals to plastic additives. The aniline dye malachite green is prepared from benzaldehyde and dimethylaniline. Benzaldehyde is also a precursor to certain acridine dyes. Via aldol condensations, benzaldehyde is converted into derivatives of cinnamaldehyde and styrene. The synthesis of mandelic acid starts with the addition of hydrocyanic acid to benzaldehyde: :mandelic acid synthesis The resulting cyanohydrin is hydrolysed to mandelic acid. (The scheme above depicts only one of the two formed enantiomers). Niche uses Benzaldehyde is used as a bee repellent. A small amount of benzaldehyde solution is placed on a fume board near the honeycombs. The bees then move away from the honey combs to avoid the fumes. The beekeeper can then remove the honey frames from the bee hive with less risk to both bees and beekeeper. Additionally, benzaldehyde is also used as a flavour chemical in JUUL e-cigarette pods, particularly the \\"Cool Mint\\", \\"Cool Cucumber\\", and \\"Fruit Medley\\" varieties. The concentration is relatively low, at ~1 Œºg/mL.  Safety  As used in food, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and soap, benzaldehyde is \\"generally regarded as safe\\" (GRAS) by the US FDA and FEMA. This status was reaffirmed after a review in 2005. It is accepted in the European Union as a flavoring agent. Toxicology studies indicate that it is safe and non-carcinogenic in the concentrations used for foods and cosmetics, and may even have anti- carcinogenic (anti-cancer) properties. For a 70 kg human, the lethal dose is estimated at 50 mL. An acceptable daily intake of 15 mg/day has been identified for benzaldehyde by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Benzaldehyde does not accumulate in human tissues. It is metabolized and then excreted in urine.

First made downloadable on 20 February 2008, the series of podgrams is a collection of Fry's writings, speeches and collective thoughts. The podgrams vary in length and are not released at any set date. The podgrams are one of the most downloaded podcast series on the internet, and have appeared in the top five most downloaded podcasts from iTunes. Critical reception has been positive, as reviewers have found the podgrams interesting and engaging. Content The subject of Stephen Fry's Podgrams differs from episode to episode. Normally, each podgram begins with an update from Fry about what he has been doing recently, his activities since the last podgram, and any housekeeping that he needs to do concerning his website, www.stephenfry.com. Fry then continues to discuss his recent activities; although in other editions the introduction leads into the main subject. The text of the podgrams is sometimes published as part of Fry's web logs, or \\"Blessays\\". Stephen Fry Fry's podgrams consist of anecdotes, such as how he broke his arm while filming a documentary in Brazil. He has also presented lectures, discussed certain themes in detail, or argued against things he sees as being wrong in today's society. In discussing his hatred of dancing, he said of music, \\"I do not want to use it as an exercise track for a farcical, meaningless, disgusting, brainless physical public exhibition of windmilling, gyrating and thrashing in a hot, loud room or hall.\\" The material is usually original for each podcast, but he may revisit topics that he has previously discussed. For example, one podgram consisted of a speech he had previously made concerning public service broadcasting. His apologetic explanation for the repeated subject matter described his busy life, and he stated that the podgram was \\"all I can offer you.\\" Reception Stephen Fry's Podgrams have been well received by critics. The series has been in the list of the top five most downloaded podcasts on iTunes, even though only a few episodes have been made so far. Chris Campling of The Times said that Fry was smug, \\"but then he has a lot to be smug about, not least the ability to waffle for 30 to 45 minutes about not very much without being boring or condescending.\\" The Good Web Guide also recommends the series, saying that \\"whether he is bringing you up to date with his recent adventures of just riffing on something that interests him, he is always compelling company.\\" The guide also states, \\"Stephen Fry is one of those very rare people who are incapable of being boring.\\" Jacques Ren√© Zammit of The Malta Independent reviewed one episode in which Fry talked about the problems within journalism. Zammit wrote positively on Fry's comments saying, \\"I share Stephen's worries completely.

The hurricane went essentially undetected before it made landfall just south of Mazatl√°n on 9 October with a pressure below and maximum sustained winds of at least . The hurricane destroyed two small towns and half of Mazatl√°n, killing at least 106 persons, injuring 102, and leaving over 1,000 homeless. Total damage was estimated at $4.5 million (1943 USD, $56 million 2008 USD). The hurricane was the strongest on record to strike Mazatl√°n. Meteorological history Location of Mazatl√°n within Mexico Sources do not reveal the exact origin of this tropical cyclone. On 8 October, a developing tropical cyclone passed between the Revillagigedo Islands and Islas Mar√≠as. It moved rapidly northeastward and arrived on the coast of Sinaloa as an intense hurricane. Mazatl√°n Observatory reported that the atmospheric pressure began dropping at 1:30 am on 9 October and fell in 8 hours, and reached a minimum of . At 1530 UTC 9 October, the hurricane made landfall just south of Mazatl√°n. At 9:30 am, the observatory reported winds of for a period of 15 minutes, which period ended when the wind blew the anemometer loose. The hurricane ranks as the strongest on record to strike the city. The storm dropped little precipitation as it passed Mazatl√°n, but fell on the afternoon of 9 October. As the storm continued inland, it rapidly weakened and apparently dissipated over the Sierra Madre Occidental. The storm apparently passed into Chihuahua and was predicted to continue into the southern United States, though the remainder of its path is unknown. The cyclone dissipated over the state of Durango within a day after landfall.Mexican daily weather maps Heavy rain developed across parts of Texas on 12/13 October 1943.  Effects and aftermath  Moving ashore as a powerful hurricane, the storm destroyed the small towns of El Roble, now in Mazatl√°n Municipality, and Palmillas. The storm partially destroyed Villa Uni√≥n (a town now in Mazatl√°n Municipality) and severely damaged the port at Mazatl√°n. In these towns, approximately 100 persons lost their lives. Though the storm was reported to have struck \\"without warning\\", most residents in the destroyed cities ably reached safety in higher ground. The hurricane destroyed about half of the buildings in Mazatl√°n, and near the ocean, the combination of strong waves, high winds, and rainfall heavily damaged many hotels and houses. The storm damaged water systems, leaving people without potable water or sewage systems. In a portion of the coastline, the storm severely impacted the communication and transportation infrastructure. The airport at Mazatl√°n sustained damage to its radio tower, and for at least 18 hours, the only communication between the city and the rest of Mexico was through the radio of a plane in the airport. Total damage was estimated at $4.5 million (1943 USD, $56 million 2008 USD). Of several fishing boats and a small Mexican Navy vessel caught in the storm, no trace reportedly was found; all persons aboard these vessels apparently died. A small coastal boat arrived in the port of Mazatl√°n after the storm and reported six crew members missing. Within two days after the storm, the death toll rose to 18; the next day, the Associated Press reported 52 deaths and 102 injuries. Ten days after the storm, military officials reported the death toll rose to 57, and the number of people left homeless by the storm reached over 1,000. By 24 hours after the storm, President Manuel √Åvila Camacho ordered nurses and doctors on standby, and for military workers in the area to prepare to assist in the aftermath. By five days after the storm, officials had restored power and communications in the area. Around the same time, the president issued an appeal for public donations for storm victims. Within a week, citizens sent large quantities of food, clothing, and medicine to the worst affected areas. The President of Mexico personally visited Mazatl√°n with other officials, bringing aid in the form of medicine and clothing. Comparison Only two other intense hurricanes struck Mazatlan during the period of record: Hurricane Olivia (1975), which hit the city with winds of , and a storm in 1957. However, Hurricane Tico (1983) moved ashore very near the city as a major hurricane.

Chaigneau had a son, Nguyen Van Duc, also known as Michel Duc Chaigneau, who wrote a memoir on his early life in Hu·∫ø (Souvenirs de Hu·∫ø) and played a role in the embassy of Phan Thanh Gian to France in 1863. In France, he became a commissioner for the Ministry of Finance.Tran and Reid, p.210 Another of his sons, Jean Chaigneau, also a half- Vietnamese, later became secretary general of the city of Rennes.Tran and Reid, p.209 Depictions Two depictions of Chaigneau are known: one in which he wears rather Westernized clothing, which is actually a paintover of an original painting in which he wears distinctly Vietnamese clothing, which was discovered underneath after restoration.Salles, pp.93-95 The original painting, probably painted around 1805 when Chaigneau was about 35, is strongly reminiscent of the uniforms worn by the armies of the soldiers of Emperor Gia Long. Beneath his blue jacket, Chaigneau wears a full Vietnamese dress of red color, with small flowers (visible on the pair of trousers) which suggests a member of the Imperial family (as other French officers, Chaigneau apparently received the honour of being considered a part of the Imperial family).

The design was an experimental design built as a private venture by Krupp in hopes of attracting a contract from the Imperial German Navy. Although the design proved moderately successful, the submarine did not attract German naval attention. She was purchased by the Imperial Russian Navy in 1904 and served with the IRN until she was lost in a diving accident in 1910. She had the distinction of being the first submarine to have been built in Germany, preceding SM U-1. Forel was succeeded in service by the Krab class (one ship). Design Forelle was a single-hull boat designed with internal ballast and compensating tanks. She had fixed angled aft planes, and movable forward units for dive control. This boat had to be carried into action on board a surface ship and launched close to its target, as she was not fitted with a separate surface propulsion system. She was equipped with two Whitehead torpedoes. Operational history The Imperial Russian Navy purchased the submarine in May 1904 for service in the Russo-Japanese War. It was shipped from Kiel to LiepƒÅja by railway, together with a team of German engineers to train the Russian crew, and was commissioned at Kronstadt on 21 August 1904. It was then sent via the Trans-Siberian Railway to Vladivostok, arriving on 29 September, and joined the Siberian Flotilla on 2 October, becoming the first Russian submarine in the Pacific. Although the submarine did not see combat during the Russo-Japanese War, its presence had an important psychological effect. Forel continued to operate out of Vladivostok after the war; however, by 1908 it was considered obsolete and was re-classed as a training vessel. The submarine sank in an accident on 17 May 1910. The crew managed to escape, and the ship was salvaged from a depth of . Vice Admiral Ivan Grigorovich authorized it to be returned to LiepƒÅja for repairs, but shipping was never implemented.

It centers on the use of the kuzhal, a double reed wind instrument, and is typically performed at temple festivals. Structure In kuzhal pattu, the kuzhal plays the lead with the support of several accompanying instruments, which may include chenda (both treble and bass), ilathalam, toppi maddalam and a sruti (drone) kuzhal. A Kuzhal Pattu typically starts with the lead kuzhal essaying an alapanam to establish a raga. The other instruments may join in as the kuzhal pattu progresses through several ragas and compositions. The span of the musical form ranges from five minutes to over an hour, with an average length of 30 minutes. Performance Kuzhal pattu is typically used as a prelude to panchari melam, but may also be played prior to night seevelis (temple circumambulations) that perform panchavadyam. It is usually performed inside the temple before midnight. The kuzhal pattu is generally played in an elaborate way at temple festivals around Thrissur and Valluvanad areas, but it isn't very uncommon in other parts of Kerala as well.

Such forms are among the most common street names in North America, but also exist in other parts of the world, especially in the Middle East. Numbered streets were first used in PhiladelphiaRybczynski, Witold. \\"City Life\\". Simon & Schuster, 1995. and now exist in many major cities and small towns. Grid-based naming systems usually start at 1 (but sometimes at a higher number or even at zero), and then proceed in numerical order. In the United States, seven out of the top ten most common street names are numbers, with the top three names being \\"2nd,\\" \\"3rd,\\" and \\"1st\\" respectively.Census and You, February 1993 (United States Census Bureau, Geography Division), as reported in \\"Most common street names\\", National League of Cities. Some cities also have lettered street names. For example, Washington, D.C., in addition to having numbered streets, also has streets identified as a letter followed by \\"Street,\\" going as high as the letter W. New York City (mostly in Brooklyn) has avenues titled \\"Avenue\\" followed by the respective letter of the alphabet, such as Avenue D. The idea for such a system was developed by Pierre Charles L‚ÄôEnfant, who devised the system for Washington. The numbered street system is criticized for taking away the individuality from a community that a named street would provide.  United States   Baltimore  34th Street in Baltimore The city of Baltimore, Maryland, has numbered streets in the north- central part of the city. The numbered streets in Baltimore do not begin with 1, but rather start with 20th Street just north of and parallel to North Avenue, the former northern boundary of the city, and what is viewed by many today is the northern boundary of Downtown Baltimore. The numbered streets, which go as high as 43rd Street, correspond with the first two digits in the addresses of the north‚Äìsouth streets they cross. Unlike in Washington, where the numbered streets run north‚Äìsouth, Baltimore's numbered streets run west‚Äìeast. All begin their names with either \\"West\\" or \\"East,\\" depending on which side of Charles Street the block is located. Some of Baltimore's numbered streets are well known for various reasons. 28th and 29th streets, a one-way pair, are the only numbered streets to have an interchange with I-83. They use the numbered designations to the east of the expressway, and to the west, they merge into a six-lane road known as Druid Park Lake Drive. East 33rd Street was the location of the now-demolished Memorial Stadium, home to the Baltimore Orioles for 38 years and the Baltimore Colts for 31. West 34th Street is the location of the annual Miracle on 34th Street, where residents on one block of the street open their porches to tourists to view their holiday decorations. West 40th Street is the location of The Rotunda shopping mall, and it merges into West 41st Street, which crosses over (but does not have an interchange with) I-83 into Television Hill and is the only numbered street in the city west of I-83.  Chicago  The City of Chicago is set on a grid with eight \\"standard\\" city blocks per mile. Some blocks are further divided in half. A standard block has 100 address numbers, meaning there are 800 numbers per mile. Chicago address numbering begins downtown at State Street and Madison Street; State Street is 0 east and west, and Madison Street is 0 north and south. Major streets a mile apart have address numbers that, for the most part, are multiples of 800. The south side of the city uses numbered east‚Äìwest streets, although older streets that were already named retained their names, particularly in the Loop. As stated above, Chicago house numbers are generally assigned at the rate of 8 blocks to a mile. The only exceptions are from Madison to 31st Street, just south of downtown. The first two main numbered roads in the system were renamed for historical figures after the numbering system was adopted. Roosevelt Road (previously 12th Street and renamed for Theodore Roosevelt) is one mile south of Madison with 12 blocks to the mile, Cermak Road (previously 22nd Street and renamed in memory of assassinated mayor Anton Cermak) is two miles south of Madison with 10 blocks to the mile, and 31st Street (3100 S) is three miles south of Madison with 9 blocks to the mile. South of 31st Street, the pattern of 8 blocks to the mile resumes, with 39th Street the next major street, 47th after that, and so on. The numbering within Chicago is continued throughout many suburbs south of the city proper. For instance, Chicago Heights has a 185th Street, set on the same numbering schema. Chicago's numbered street system was adopted in 1911 as a result of new legislation. Madison Street was made the base for all street numbering, and State Street for north‚Äìsouth streets.  Cleveland  As a general rule, the only numbered streets in Cleveland run‚Äîgenerally‚Äînorth‚Äìsouth, while streets that run parallel to the lake shore (generally east‚Äìwest) have names rather than numbers. Ontario Street in downtown Cleveland separates east- and west-numbered streets, with the numbers, increasing as one travels further away from Ontario. Conforming east‚Äìwest roads are given a name, rather than a number, and the suffix \\"Avenue.\\" Where an avenue crosses Ontario street or the Cuyahoga River, its name changes, meaning that a numbered street does not intersect a given avenue more than once. For example, stating a location as \\"65th and Detroit\\" implies West 65th street, since Detroit Avenue changes to Superior Avenue when it crosses the river. Non-conforming streets are suffixed with names other than \\"street\\" or \\"avenue,\\" e.g., West Boulevard, Old River Road, Martin Luther King Jr. Drive. Geographic idiosyncrasies in certain parts of the city mean that this is by no means an absolute rule but generally applies within the city proper. The major exceptions to this system are the street names in the near west side city of Lakewood, and in a few cities on the far east side, generally south of Euclid Avenue and north of Chagrin Boulevard. The street numbering extends from West 233rd in North Olmsted to East 367th in Eastlake, adjacent to the Willoughby municipal line.  Denver  Denver has two systems in place in two distinct areas of the city. Downtown Denver's diagonal street system technically begins with 4th Street near Auraria Campus, underneath the Colfax Avenue viaduct. The system then counts up northeastward from 4th Street to 40th Street. The diagonal system meets the normal numbered grid at various points, with the termination of the downtown system at 40th Avenue and 40th Street in the Five Points neighborhood. The second system is a typical East/West layout, with directional indicators. First Avenue is adjacent to Ellsworth Avenue in Central Denver; the series extends to 168th Avenue in unincorporated Adams County. Exceptions include Colfax Avenue, which takes the place of 15th Avenue, and Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, which generally takes the place of East 32nd Avenue. The designations East and North are generally not used unless needed. Building numbers on cross-streets reflect the street numbering; for example, 1800 Colorado Boulevard would be at the corner of 18th Avenue. (1800 South Colorado Boulevard is outside the area of numbered streets.)  Detroit  8 Mile Road overpass In the northern suburbs of Detroit, \\"___ Mile Road\\" runs east‚Äìwest, a stated number of miles from the center of Detroit. Some of these roads are also known by other names. The lowest numbered road is 5 Mile Road, while the city limits end at 8 Mile Road, which at one time was called \\"Baseline Road\\". The highest such numbered road is 38 Mile Road, which is mostly in Almont. The city of Detroit also has some conventional numbered streets within the city limits.  Greater Miami  In Greater Miami, numbered streets go into the three digits, with varying, overlapping sets of numbered streets. The area has roads that are named as a number followed by \\"Street\\" that runs west‚Äìeast, and a number followed by \\"Avenue\\" that runs north‚Äìsouth. All these streets start their names with NW, NE, SW, or SE, depending on where they are in relation to the center of Miami. In the Miami suburbs, some numbered streets and avenues are paired with a parallel \\"Court\\", \\"Drive\\", \\"Place\\" or \\"Terrace\\"; while in the same area, other sets of numbered streets and avenues exist with lower numbers, such as in Hialeah, where W 68th St is also designated NW 122 St . This is known to lead to confusion among some, especially non-locals. Similar numbering systems are used throughout the state of Florida, such as in Gainesville, Ocala, Panama City, and Jacksonville.  New York City  Fifth Avenue and E. 57th Street in Manhattan The Commissioners' Plan of 1811 laid out the grid that covers most of Manhattan today. Most east‚Äìwest streets (which actually run southeast‚Äìnorthwest) are named \\"___th Street\\", and a few major north‚Äìsouth streets (which actually run northeast‚Äìsouthwest, roughly parallel to the island's long axis) are named \\"___th Avenue\\". The highest-numbered street on Manhattan Island is 220th Street, and the highest-numbered street in the Borough of Manhattan is 228th Street. The Manhattan numbered street grid continues north in The Bronx, where the highest numbered street is West 263rd Street on the border of Yonkers. The only numbered avenue in The Bronx is a continuation of Manhattan's 3rd Avenue. In Queens, the melding of various grids from pre-consolidation villages resulted in repeat numbers, for example, 67th Street, 67th Place, 67th Avenue, 67th Road, and 67th Drive. Streets and places run north to south, while avenues, roads, and drives run east to west. The avenues run from Third Avenue in Whitestone to 165th Avenue in Howard Beach. Streets run from First Street in Astoria to 271st Street in Floral Park. In Brooklyn, there are ten sets of numbered streets (unprefixed numbered streets as well as North, South, East, West, Bay, Brighton, Paerdegat, Plumb, and Flatlands numbered streets), along with numbered avenues up to 28th Avenue and letter avenues up to Avenue Z. Manhattan's Alphabet City consists of Avenues A through D. The Rockaways section of Queens has streets prefixed with the word Beach. However, street signs in this area typically identify this prefix using only the letter B (e.g. \\"B 116 St\\"). The neighborhood of Broad Channel also has its own network of numbered roads, prefixed with East or West, relative to Cross Bay Boulevard. The closest cross street to a given building number in Manhattan can be estimated using the Manhattan address algorithm. The highest-numbered street in all of New York City is 271st Street, located in Glen Oaks, Queens.F.Y.I., NYTimes 704th Street in Orangeburg, New York is the highest-numbered street in the Greater New York City area, and at one point was the highest-numbered street in the United States.Detroit Free Press.

The highest-numbered Avenue in Manhattan is the obscure 13th Avenue, on Gansevoort Peninsula in the Hudson River just north of Gansevoort Street. Currently, only one unmarked block remains, currently used as a garbage truck access behind the Bloomfield Street Sanitation Depot. The street was once longer, but much of the land it was built on was removed to provide longer piers for berthing larger ships, such as and , without protruding further into the Hudson River. 12th Avenue is the highest numbered avenue that is signed by the city and accessible to the public. Higher-numbered avenues exist in other boroughs. Sixth and a Half Avenue, is the only numbered avenue in Manhattan involving fractions.Officially Marking a New Manhattan Avenue, NYTimes - City Room, July 13, 2012 - accessed 2012-07-31.  Philadelphia  Original street plan of Center City Philadelphia Central Philadelphia was laid out by Thomas Holme in 1683 and was the first city to use numbered streets systematically. While the original plan had two sets of north‚Äìsouth numbered streets, one parallel to the Delaware River and one to the Schuylkill; all are now numbered from the Delaware, with numbers increasing westward and continuing across the Schuylkill through West Philadelphia to the edge of the city. There are two main exceptions to this pattern: Holme's plan included Front Street in place of First and Broad Street in place of Fourteenth; \\"Schuylkill Front Street\\" became 22nd when the streets west of Broad were renumbered. The highest numbered street is 90th Street. In Southwest Philadelphia, the grid is oblique, with numbered streets running from northwest to southeast and meeting their West Philadelphia equivalents at Baltimore Avenue. In general, numbered streets northwest of the Schuylkill are not aligned with their counterparts across the river in South Philadelphia. The Kensington area has streets lettered \\"A\\" through \\"O\\". The East Oak Lane and West Oak Lane sections of the city contains east‚Äìwest streets numbered from 64th Avenue to 80th Avenue, with the numbers correspondent with the block numbers north from Market Street. In the early 20th century, many of Chestnut Hill's previously numbered streets were renamed for Native American tribes.  San Francisco  San Francisco has two numbered series: streets, which run generally east‚Äìwest, and avenues, which are north‚Äìsouth. The two series do not meet. The numbered streets begin with 1st Street in SoMa and end with 30th Street in Noe Valley. Some of these streets are only nominally east‚Äìwest, which causes anomalies such as 3rd Street meeting 26th Street in the Dogpatch. The numbered avenues are in the Richmond and Sunset Districts beginning with 2nd Avenue and continuing westward to 48th Avenue, which runs parallel to the Pacific Ocean shore.  Washington, D.C.  7th St and H Street NW in Washington, D.C. Pierre L'Enfant's plan for Washington, D.C. includes both radial avenues and grid system consisting of both numbered and lettered streets. North-south streets are named with numbers, such as \\"7th Street,\\" and west‚Äìeast streets are named with letters, such as \\"H Street.\\" The name is then followed with a directional suffix (NW, NE, SW, or SE), specifying a quadrant of the city (e.g. 16th Street Northwest). The quadrants meet at the U.S. Capitol building. Within the city, the quadrants are divided by three streets known as North, East, and South Capitol Streets, and by the National Mall, which takes the place of the non-existent West Capitol Street. Numbers start counting upward on either side of North and South Capitol Streets, and letters start counting upward on either side of East Capitol Street and the National Mall.  Canada   Calgary  The city of Calgary uses a quadrant system with a grid set. The east‚Äìwest demarcation line separating the north and south is the Bow River west of Nose Creek, Centre Avenue directly east of Nose Creek, and Memorial Drive east of 36th Street. The north‚Äìsouth line is Centre Street north of Glenmore Trail and Macleod Trail south of Glenmore Trail. Streets run north‚Äìsouth and avenues run east‚Äìwest; both are numbered beginning at the demarcation lines. Many older areas also have \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" streets interspersed between the numbered streets; for instance, in most older neighbourhoods the street directly west of Centre Street is 1st Street, but a Centre A Street runs for short distances in certain areas. Suburban neighbourhoods built since approximately 1971 tend to have named streets except in cases where numbered streets extend into the district. A typical (if fictional) street address in an older district would be \\"4214-19A Street SW\\". As such, addresses of buildings on numbered streets are worthless without a quadrant. The grid is based on the Dominion Land Survey, with many of the main roads in the older areas of town (such as Crowchild Trail SW and 17th Avenue SE) following the lines that separate one DLS section from another (\\"section lines\\"). Avenues in the Municipal District of Foothills No. 31, south of the city are numbered as they would be if they were in the city (with quadrant omitted). However, the basis for numbered streets in the Municipal District of Foothills (the \\"zero\\" street) is the Fifth Meridian (114¬∞ west), approximately east of Calgary's Centre Street. Streets are then numbered east and west with 16 streets for each one-mile grid road ‚Äì or one street number per 100 m. This leads to situations at the south city limit where the street number changes (e.g. 85 Street SW changes to 144 Street W). The impetus for this came originally from emergency response groups, such as fire departments and police. Rocky View County, which surrounds Calgary to the east, west and north, uses a different system of road numbers based on the Alberta Township System for land surveys. In Rocky View, range roads run north‚Äìsouth and are numbered in (the boundary of one survey section) increments west from the nearest survey range line (e.g. Range Road 51 is 1 mile west of the east edge of Range 5 west of the 5th Meridian). Township roads are east-west roads numbered in similar increments north of survey township lines (e.g. Township Road 264 is 4 miles north of the south edge of Township 26). Addressing is based on the distance west or north from the nearest crossroad (e.g. 264054 Range Road 51 would be north of Township Road 264). Roads ending in 0 are on their respective range or township lines. Suffixed roads (e.g. ending with an \\"A\\", \\"B\\", etc...) are between section lines (e.g. along \\"quarter\\" lines which split the 640-acre sections into smaller quarter-sections).  Edmonton  The city of Edmonton's grid system is similar in nature to Calgary's, except that the two roads designated at the \\"center\\" of Edmonton were numbered 101st (Jasper) Avenue and 101st (Main) Street. This was done to eliminate the possibility that the city would have quadrants as Calgary does. The gradual expansion of the city now extends it east and south of what is 1st (Meridian) Street and 1st (Quadrant) Avenue. As such, most of the city is officially located in the northwest quadrant, but common practice is to not refer to the quadrant unless the address being mentioned is not located in the northwest quadrant. The city limits do not yet extend into where the southeast quadrant would be located, meaning addresses will be post-fixed with either NW, SW, or NE.  Metro Vancouver  A grid system of numbered streets and avenues is used south of the Fraser River, in the municipalities of Delta, Surrey and Langley. Avenues run east-west and are numbered starting with 0 (\\"Zero\\") avenue next to the Canada‚ÄìUS border and going north, with the numbers incrementing each . Streets run north-south and are numbered starting with zero lying in the Strait of Georgia and going east, with the numbers incrementing each mile, just like the avenues. Minor streets named with a number followed by a letter (136A Street, 136B street) are situated between the numbers. The city of Vancouver proper uses its own road numbering system, numbering east-west avenues from first at False Creek and incrementing south. Avenues are further classified with an \\"East\\" or \\"West\\" prefix (e.g. E 41st Ave). Ontario Street (two blocks west of Main Street) demarcates the boundary for this prefix. The highest numbered street in the city is W 77th Avenue, in an industrial area of the Marpole neighbourhood. Similarly, the city of New Westminster has its own numbering system with avenues northeast-southwest and streets northwest-southeast. This numbered grid continues into southeastern parts of neighbouring Burnaby.  Other Canadian cities and towns  Many small towns and cities in Western Canada use numbered streets. Some begin numbering at Centre or Main (0) as Calgary does, but others follow Edmonton's example and begin numbering at 1, 50, or 100. Examples include Brandon, Manitoba, where streets, running north- south, are numbered; and Red Deer, Alberta, where numbered streets run east- west, and numbered avenues run north-south. In Saskatoon, Saskatchewan only the streets, running east-west, are numbered (aside from avenues downtown, which is numbered from 1st to 10th); there are lettered avenues to the west of Idylwyld Drive, which was formerly known as Avenue A (a stub of Avenue A does remain south of 20th Street though). Streets in the Sutherland district in Saskatoon have numbered 101 St to 117 St. This was done when the town of Sutherland amalgamated with Saskatoon, to avoid confusion with Saskatoon's numbered streets, which run from 1 to 71. Numerous street numbering schemes were proposed for the various municipalities originally making up Greater Winnipeg, but most were quickly rescinded, as the city is not built on a uniform grid and numbering was considered unwieldy. Only one roadway (Fifth Avenue in St. Vital) retains its \\"number\\", but the street name is legally the word \\"Fifth\\" and not the number. Numbered roadways are also found within Canadian Forces Base Winnipeg, but the street names within the base were chosen by the Department of National Defence and not by the city itself. Numbered streets are less common in Eastern Canada, with some notable exceptions. Owen Sound, Ontario, is one of the few cities that primarily use numbered streets and avenues. Saint-Georges, Quebec has a numbered system of streets/rues and avenues that extends into the surrounding Chaudi√®re- Appalaches region. Many urban enclaves were established with numbered streets or avenues as part of their distinct character. The Glebe in Ottawa is an example, with avenues numbered First to Fifth. New Toronto has numbered streets, running westward off of Lake Shore Boulevard, starting at 1st Street (just west of Royal York Road), to 43rd Street, excluding Eighteenth Street and Thirty-Fourth Street, as Kipling Avenue and the Long Branch Avenue replace them, respectively. The city of St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador has a single numbered street called 18th Street, located in the Waterford Valley area; it is unclear how this name originated or whether this street was meant to form part of a larger grid system.  Latin America   Argentina  Cities built on a grid plan in the interior of Argentina tend to use numbers for their streets, in the familiar even versus odd configuration, with the notable exception of La Plata, where the numbering is consecutive.  Brazil  Some cities (such as Goi√¢nia and Rio Claro) use numbered streets, though main streets might receive different names.  Colombia  All 1,119 municipalities in Colombia have numbered streets divided into a grid, and the government of Colombia has a complete nomenclature to classify the streets. Occasionally main streets receive names like El Dorado Avenue in Bogota the capital city.  Cuba (Havana)  Havana has even-numbered streets running north‚Äìsouth, and odd-numbered streets running east‚Äìwest on the west side of the city, with lettered streets from A through P running north‚Äìsouth beginning on the east side of Paseo Avenue. Some streets are named with a number followed by a letter (23 B Street).  Europe   Germany (Mannheim)  Map of Mannheim's city center A notable European example is the city center of Mannheim where blocks are numbered in a grid-like system since 1811, and streets actually do not have names anymore‚Äîfor example the houses in \\"street\\" B7 are those in the block in grid B7. The houses on the other side of the street belong to other blocks and therefore have another street name.  Hungary (Budapest)  In the capital city Budapest there are some outer districts which have areas with numbered streets (and in one case, a numbered square), like Akad√©mia√∫jtelep. These areas are planned communities built in the 1950s.  Netherlands (Lelystad)  In Lelystad some streets have a combination of names and numbers. The streets with the same name (but different number) are in the same area. In Botter the names are Botter and Tjalk, in Galjoen the names are Galjoen and Jol, in Schouw the names are Schouw and Gondel, although there are \\"normal\\" names there, etc. There are also other cities with similar numbering like Wijchen and Nijmegen.  Portugal (Espinho)  A notable example of a citywide numbered streets system in Portugal, is the city of Espinho. Espinho, in the district of Aveiro, was mainly built in the late 19th century in a grid pattern, with its streets being numbered instead of being named. Streets running north‚Äìsouth are numbered with even numbers and streets running west‚Äìeast are numbered with odd numbers. Numbered streets are also occasionally used in other Portuguese cities, but only in specific areas within them and not as a citywide system. This happens mainly in newly built neighborhoods, especially those planned in a grid pattern.  Russia (Saint Petersburg)   United Kingdom  With the notable exception of Milton Keynes, numbered streets are uncommon in the United Kingdom because cities and towns are generally not laid out in grids. However, the Village, a small area of Trafford Park is laid out in a grid pattern. It has north‚Äìsouth streets numbered from First Avenue in the east to Fifth Avenue in the west, and west‚Äìeast streets numbered from Fifth Street in the south to Eleventh Street in the north. The former mining town of Newtongrange in Midlothian, Scotland has residential streets numbered from First Street to Tenth Street.  Asia   Hong Kong  On Hong Kong Island, in the Sai Ying Pun neighborhood, there are a series of streets named with numbers. They are part of a planned layout of the early development of Hong Kong. See First Street  Iran (Tehran)  In Tehran there are multiple sets of numbered streets running from west to east in various sections of the north side of town. In many such sections, the street numbers count upward by two, with even-numbered streets on one side of a neighborhood, and odd- numbered streets on the other. The highest numbered street is 304th Street. The city also has other series of streets with a name combining with a number.  United Arab Emirates  In the United Arab Emirates, most streets and roads are numbered. Most commonly in smaller cities, they are identified with a 4-digit number followed by \\"way\\". Abu Dhabi has even-numbered streets running west‚Äìeast, and odd-numbered streets running north‚Äìsouth. Dubai has numbered streets that simply have the number followed by \\"street\\" (e.g. 41st Street), as well as streets named with a number followed by a letter (23 B Street).

Petrov, nicknamed Doctor Death by the Russian media, was a practicing doctor who targeted patients from a local health center, killing them by lethal injection at their homes then robbing them. Petrov was sentenced to life imprisonment, and is suspected to have killed up to 19 people until his arrest. Background Maxim Vladimirovich Petrov worked as an emergency doctor in St Petersburg, living in the central Vasilievsky Island area of the city. Petrov had been married twice and has three children, one from a first marriage and two from his second and current marriage. Crimes Early robberies In 1997 Petrov began robbing his patients by visiting their home, unannounced, and usually in the morning when relatives would be at work. He would then measure their blood pressure and suggest they needed an injection which anaesthetized them. While they were unconscious, Petrov stole their possessions, even taking rings and earrings from his victims' bodies. The first few victims did not die, instead waking up later after he had left. Petrov committed 47 robberies until his arrest in 2000. Murders Petrov committed his first murder on 2 February 1999, during his thirtieth robbery, when he was interrupted by the daughter of an anaesthetised patient who returned home while he was stealing. He stabbed the daughter with a screwdriver and then strangled the unconscious patient with a stocking. After this, Petrov's modus operandi changed: he began to use a lethal mix of a variety of different drugs to inject into his victims instead of an anaesthetic, so that the victim would die, and so the police would think that the killer had little medical knowledge. Petrov would then set fire to their homes to destroy any evidence. Arrest and conviction The police did not release a photofit of the suspect, thinking he would soon be caught. However, it took until the following year for them to realise how the victims were being selected. All were included in the same list of lung patients who had undergone a fluorography, which he found in a local health centre. Using this list, they identified 72 possible future victims in an operation called \\"Medbrat\\" (\\"Male Nurse\\"), involving 700 police officers. They arrested Petrov when he visited one of the patients on 17 January 2000. On his arrest, Petrov admitted to the murders, but recanted his confession a few months later, blaming it on the intense psychological pressure he had endured while in custody. Various possessions stolen from the victims were later found in his flat, though he had already sold others at the market. Six of the patients who were not killed were seriously injured. Petrov was suspected of committing 19 murders, but tried for just 17. In 2002, Petrov was found guilty of 11 murders and was sentenced by judge Valentina Kudriashova to life imprisonment.

Adonkor made his debut for the 'Canaries' on 15 April 1981 in a 2‚Äì2 draw against Metz, but only established himself in Jean-Claude Suaudeau's first team in the 1982‚Äì83 season, which his club finished as French champions, nearly adding the Coupe de France to their honours list ‚Äì a game in which Adonkor was sent off. The 1982‚Äì83 championship was to be his only major honour. By trade a strong, hard-tackling midfielder who could also play in attack, Adonkor had become a 'rock' (in Suaudeau's words) in the heart of Nantes's defence when his career was cut brutally short. Driving back from Saint Nazaire to Nantes with his teammates Jean-Michel Labejof (who died) and Sidi Kabahe (who survived, but never played again), he was the victim of a fatal car crash. Adonkor was then widely tipped to become a French international. The news of Adonkor's death was passed on to Marcel Desailly by his close friend and teammate Didier Deschamps. Adonkor was Desailly's role model. Adonkor was an impressive centre back who was close to Marcel, when the news had broke Marcel was deeply saddened however was determined to make the rest of his career a tribute to his late half brother. Adonkor was hugely successful at FC Nantes academy and was tipped to be a regular starter in the team. However this was not to be with the events that had occurred in November 1984. Seth has always been remembered by FC Nantes fans as the one with a lot of promise but was taken too early.

Some research describes the Aha! effect (also known as insight or epiphany) as a memory advantage, but conflicting results exist as to where exactly it occurs in the brain, and it is difficult to predict under what circumstances one can predict an Aha! moment. Insight is a psychological term that attempts to describe the process in problem solving when a previously unsolvable puzzle becomes suddenly clear and obvious. Often this transition from not understanding to spontaneous comprehension is accompanied by an exclamation of joy or satisfaction, an Aha! moment. A person utilizing insight to solve a problem is able to give accurate, discrete, all-or-nothing type responses, whereas individuals not using the insight process are more likely to produce partial, incomplete responses. A recent theoretical account of the Aha! moment started with four defining attributes of this experience. First, the Aha! moment appears suddenly; second, the solution to a problem can be processed smoothly, or fluently; third, the Aha! moment elicits positive affect; fourth, a person experiencing the Aha! moment is convinced that a solution is true. These four attributes are not separate but can be combined because the experience of processing fluency, especially when it occurs surprisingly (for example, because it is sudden), elicits both positive affect and judged truth. Insight can be conceptualized as a two phase process. The first phase of an Aha! experience requires the problem solver to come upon an impasse, where they become stuck and even though they may seemingly have explored all the possibilities, are still unable to retrieve or generate a solution. The second phase occurs suddenly and unexpectedly. After a break in mental fixation or re-evaluating the problem, the answer is retrieved.Qui & Zhang (2008) \\"Aha! Effects in a Guessing Chinese Logograph Task: An Event- Related Potential Study. Chinese Science Bulletin. 53 (3), 384‚Äì391. Some research suggest that insight problems are difficult to solve because of our mental fixation on the inappropriate aspects of the problem content. In order to solve insight problems, one must \\"think outside the box\\". It is this elaborate rehearsal that may cause people to have better memory for Aha! moments. Insight is believed to occur with a break in mental fixation, allowing the solution to appear transparent and obvious. History and etymology The effect is named from a story about ancient Greek polymath Archimedes. In the story, Archimedes was asked (c. 250 BC) by the local king to determine whether a crown was pure gold. During a subsequent trip to a public bath, Archimedes noted that water was displaced when his body sank into the bath, and particularly that the volume of water displaced equaled the volume of his body immersed in the water. Having discovered how to measure the volume of an irregular object, and conceiving of a method to solve the king's problem, Archimedes allegedly leaped out and ran home naked, shouting Œµ·ΩïœÅŒ∑Œ∫Œ± (eureka, \\"I have found it!\\"). This story is now thought to be fictional, because it was first mentioned by the Roman writer Vitruvius nearly 200 years after the date of the alleged event, and because the method described by Vitruvius would not have worked.Fact or Fiction?: Archimedes Coined the Term \\"Eureka!\\" in the Bath, Scientific American However, Archimedes certainly did important, original work in hydrostatics, notably in his On Floating Bodies  Research   Initial research  Research on the Aha! moment dates back more than 100 years, to the Gestalt psychologists' first experiments on chimpanzee cognition. In his 1921 book, Wolfgang K√∂hler described the first instance of insightful thinking in animals: One of his chimpanzees, Sultan, was presented with the task of reaching a banana that had been strung up high on the ceiling so that it was impossible to reach by jumping. After several failed attempts to reach the banana, Sultan sulked in the corner for a while, then suddenly jumped up and stacked a few boxes upon each other, climbed them and thus was able to grab the banana. This observation was interpreted as insightful thinking. K√∂hler's work was continued by Karl Duncker and Max Wertheimer. The Eureka effect was later also described by Pamela Auble, Jeffrey Franks and Salvatore Soraci in 1979. The subject would be presented with an initially confusing sentence such as \\"The haystack was important because the cloth ripped\\". After a certain period of time of non-comprehension by the reader, the cue word (parachute) would be presented, the reader could comprehend the sentence, and this resulted in better recall on memory tests. Subjects spend a considerable amount of time attempting to solve the problem, and initially it was hypothesized that elaboration towards comprehension may play a role in increased recall. There was no evidence that elaboration had any effect for recall. It was found that both \\"easy\\" and \\"hard\\" sentences that resulted in an Aha! effect had significantly better recall rates than sentences that subjects were able to comprehend immediately. In fact equal recall rates were obtained for both \\"easy\\" and \\"hard\\" sentences which were initially noncomprehensible. It seems to be this noncomprehension to comprehension which results in better recall. The essence of the aha feeling underlining insight problem solving was systemically investigated by Danek et al. and Shen and his colleagues.  How people solve insight problems  Currently there are two theories for how people arrive at the solution for insight problems. The first is the progress monitoring theory. The person will analyze the distance from their current state to the goal state. Once a person realizes that they cannot solve the problem while on their current path, they will seek alternative solutions. In insight problems this usually occurs late in the puzzle. The second way that people attempt to solve these puzzles is the representational change theory. The problem solver initially has a low probability for success because they use inappropriate knowledge as they set unnecessary constraints on the problem. Once the person relaxes his or her constraints, they can bring previously unavailable knowledge into working memory to solve the problem. The person also utilizes chunk decomposition, where he or she will separate meaningful chunks into their component pieces. Both constraint relaxation and chunk decomposition allow for a change in representation, that is, a change in the distribution of activation across working memory, at which point they may exclaim, \\"Aha!\\" Currently both theories have support, with the progress monitoring theory being more suited to multiple step problems, and the representational change theory more suited to single step problems. The Eureka effect on memory occurs only when there is an initial confusion. When subjects were presented with a clue word before the confusing sentence was presented, there was no effect on recall. If the clue was provided after the sentence was presented, an increase in recall occurred.  Memory  It had been determined that recall is greater for items that were generated by the subject versus if the subject was presented with the stimuli. There seems to be a memory advantage for instances where people are able to produce an answer themselves, recall was higher when Aha! reactions occurred. They tested sentences that were initially hard to understand, but when presented with a cued word, the comprehension became more apparent. Other evidence was found indicating that effort in processing visual stimuli was recalled more frequently than the stimuli that were simply presented. This study was done using connect-the-dots or verbal instruction to produce either a nonsense or real image. It is believed that effort made to comprehend something when encoding induces activation of alternative cues that later participate in recall.  Cerebral lateralization  Functional magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalogram studies have found that problem solving requiring insight involves increased activity in the right cerebral hemisphere as compared with problem solving not requiring insight. In particular, increased activity was found in the right hemisphere anterior superior temporal gyrus.  Sleep  Some unconscious processing may take place while a person is asleep, and there are several cases of scientific discoveries coming to people in their dreams. Friedrich August Kekul√© von Stradonitz said that the ring structure of benzene came to him in a dream where a snake was eating its own tail. Studies have shown increased performance at insight problems if the subjects slept during a break between receiving the problem and solving it. Sleep may function to restructure problems, and allow new insights to be reached.Wagner, U. et al. (2004) Sleep Inspires Insight, Nature 427, pp. 352‚Äì355. Henri Poincar√© stated that he valued sleep as a time for \\"unconscious thought\\" that helped him break through problems.  Other theories  Professor Stellan Ohlsson believes that at the beginning of the problem-solving process, some salient features of the problem are incorporated into a mental representation of the problem. In the first step of solving the problem, it is considered in the light of previous experience. Eventually, an impasse is reached, where all approaches to the problem have failed, and the person becomes frustrated. Ohlsson believes that this impasse drives unconscious processes which change the mental representation of a problem, and cause novel solutions to occur.Scientific American Mind, October/November 2006  General procedure for conducting ERP and EEG studies  When studying insight, or the Aha! effect, ERP or EEG general methods are used. Initially a baseline measurement is taken, which generally asks the subject to simply remember an answer to a question. Following this, subjects are asked to focus on the screen while a logogriph is shown, and then they are given time with a blank screen to get the answer, once they do they are required to press a key. After which the answer appears on the screen. The subjects are then asked to press one key to indicate that they thought of the correct answer and another to indicate if they got the answer wrong, finally, not to press a key at all if they were unsure or did not know the answer.  Evidence in EEG studies  Resting-state neural activity has a standing influence on cognitive strategies used when solving problems, particularly in the case of deriving solutions by methodical search or by sudden insight. The two cognitive strategies used involve both search and analysis of current state of a problem, to the goal state of that problem, while insight problems are a sudden awareness of the solution to a problem. Subjects studied were first recorded on the base-line resting state of thinking. After being tested using the method described in the General Procedure for Conducting ERP and EEG Studies, the ratio of insight versus non- insight solution were made to determine whether an individual is classified as a high insight (HI) or a low insight (LI) individual. Discriminating between HI and LI individuals were important as both groups use different cognitive strategies to solve anagram problems used in this study. Right hemisphere activation is believed to be involved in Aha! effects, so it comes as no surprise that HI individuals would show greater activation in the right hemisphere than the left hemisphere when compared to the LI individuals. Evidence was found to support this idea, there was greater activation in HI subjects at the right dorsal-frontal (low-alpha band), right inferior-frontal (beta and gamma bands) and the right parietal (gamma band) areas. As for LI subjects, left inferior-frontal and left anterior-temporal areas were active (low-alpha band). There were also differences in attention between individuals of HI and LI. It has been suggested that individuals who are highly creative exhibit diffuse attention, thus allowing them a greater range of environmental stimuli. It was found that individuals who displayed HI would have less resting state occipital alpha-band activity, meaning there would be less inhibition of the visual system. Individuals that were less creative were found to focus their attention, thus causing them to sample less of their environment. Although, LI individuals were shown to have more occipital beta activity, consistent with heightened focused attention.  Evidence in ERP studies  These results are more reflective of models, rather than empirical evidence, as source localization is hard to determine precisely. Due to the nature of these studies that use Chinese logographs, there is a difficulty in an exact translation; a language barrier certainly exists. There are some difficulties that exist in brain imaging when it comes to insight, thus making it hard to discuss neural mechanisms. Issues include: that insight occurs when an unwarranted mental fixation is broken and when novel task related associations are formed on top of old cognitive skills. One theory discussed found that \\"Aha\\" answers produced more negative ERP results, N380 in the ACC, than the \\"No-Aha\\" answers, 250‚Äì500 ms, after an answer was produced. The authors suspected that this N380 in the ACC, which plays the role of a warning sign of breaking the mental set, was a reflection of the Aha! effect. Another study was done showed that an Aha! effect was elicited at N320 which has a strong activation in the central-posterior region. These previous studies reflective the premise of the study, that the Aha! effect occurs in the anterior cingulate cortex, while this study finds results indicating the posterior cingulate cortex is responsible. It was found that there was a N350 in the posterior cingulate cortex for successful guessing of logographs, not in the anterior cingulate cortex. The posterior cingulate cortex seems to play a more non-executive function in monitoring and inhibiting the mind set and cognitive function. Another significant finding of this study done by Qiu and Zhang (2008), was a late positive component (LPC) in successful guessing of the logograph and then recognition of the answer at 600 and 700 ms, post- stimulus, in the parahippocampal gyrus (BA34). The data suggests that the parahippocampus is involved in searching of a correct answer by manipulating it in working memory, and integrating relationships between the base of the target logograph. The parahippocampal gyrus may reflect the formation of novel associations while solving insight problem. Another ERP study is fairly similar to the Qiu and Zhang, 2008 study, however, this study claims to have anterior cingulate cortex activation at N380, which may be responsible for the mediation of breaking the mental set. Other areas of interest were prefrontal cortex (PFC), the posterior parietal cortex, and the medial temporal lobe. If subjects failed to solve the riddle, and then were shown the correct answer, they displayed the feeling of insight, which reflected the electroencephalogram recordings. Overall, it is quite apparent that there are many aspects that can explain the Aha! effect. No particular area has been determined but from the information gathered, it seems that insight occurs in many parts of the brain, within a given time period.  Evidence in fMRI studies  A study with the goal of recording the activity that occurs in the brain during an Aha! moment using fMRIs was conducted in 2003 by Jing Luo and Kazuhisa Niki. Participants in this study were presented with a series of Japanese riddles, and asked to rate their impressions toward each question using the following scale: (1) I can understand this question very well and know the answer; (2) I can understand this question very well and feel it is interesting, but I do not know the answer; or (3) I cannot understand this question and do not know the answer. This scale allowed the researchers to only look at participants who would experience an Aha! moment upon viewing the answer to the riddle. In previous studies on insight, researchers have found that participants reported feelings of insight when they viewed the answer to an unsolved riddle or problem. Luo and Niki had the goal of recording these feelings of insight in their participants using fMRIs. This method allowed the researchers to directly observe the activity that was occurring in the participant's brains during an Aha! moment. :An example of a Japanese riddle used in the study: The thing that can move heavy logs, but cannot move a small nail -> A river. Participants were given 3 minutes to respond to each riddle, before the answer to the riddle was revealed. If the participant experienced an Aha! moment upon viewing the correct answer, any brain activity would be recorded on the fMRI. The fMRI results for this study showed that when participants were given the answer to an unsolved riddle, the activity in their right hippocampus increased significantly during these Aha! moments. This increased activity in the right hippocampus may be attributed to the formation of new associations between old nodes. These new associations will in turn strengthen memory for the riddles and their solutions. Although various studies using EEGs, ERPs, and fMRI's report activation in a variety of areas in the brain during Aha! moments, this activity occurs predominantly in the right hemisphere. More details on the neural basis of insight see a recent review named \\"New advances in the neural correlates of insight: A decade in review of the insightful brain\\" Insight problems and problems with insight Insight problems = The Nine Dot Problem = The Nine Dot Problem with solution. Most individuals fail to draw lines beyond the dots that compose the square, and are unable to solve this puzzle. The Nine Dot Problem is a classic spatial problem used by psychologists to study insight. The problem consists of a 3 √ó 3 square created by 9 black dots. The task is to connect all 9 dots using exactly 4 straight lines, without retracing or removing one's pen from the paper. Kershaw & Ohlsson report that in a laboratory setting with a time limit of 2 or 3 minutes, the expected solution rate is 0%. The difficulty with the Nine Dot Problem is that it requires respondents to look beyond the conventional figure-ground relationships that create subtle, illusory spatial constraints and (literally) \\"think outside of the box\\". Breaking the spatial constraints shows a shift in attention in working memory and utilizing new knowledge factors to solve the puzzle. = Verbal riddles = Verbal riddles are becoming popular problems in insight research. Example: \\"A man was washing windows on a high-rise building when he fell from the 40-foot ladder to the concrete path below. Amazingly, he was unhurt. Why? [Answer] He slipped from the bottom rung!\\" = Matchstick arithmetic = Matchstick arithmetic, which was developed and used by G. Knoblich, involves matchsticks that are arranged to show a simple but incorrect math equation in Roman numerals. The task is to correct the equation by moving only one matchstick. Two examples of Matchstick Arithmetic Problems. = Anagrams = Anagrams involve manipulating the order of a given set of letters in order to create one or many words. The original set of letters may be a word itself, or simply a jumble. Example: Santa can be transformed to spell Satan. = Rebus puzzles = Rebus puzzles, also called \\"wordies\\", involve verbal and visual cues that force the respondent to restructure and \\"read between the lines\\" (almost literally) to solve the puzzle. Some examples: # Puzzle: you just me [Answer: just between you and me] # Puzzle: PUNISHMENT [Answer: capital punishment] # Puzzle: i i i OOOOO [Answer: circles under the eyes] = Remote Associates Test (RAT) = The Remote Associates Test (known as the RAT) was developed by Martha Mednick in 1962 to test creativity. However, it has recently been utilized in insight research. The test consists of presenting participants with a set of words, such as lick, mine, and shaker. The task is to identify the word that connects these three seemingly unrelated ones. In this example, the answer is salt. The link between words is associative, and does not follow rules of logic, concept formation or problem solving, and thus requires the respondent to work outside of these common heuristical constraints. Performance on the RAT is known to correlate with performance on other standard insight problems. = The Eight Coin Problem = In this problem a set of 8 coins is arranged on a table in a certain configuration, and the subject is told to move 2 coins so that all coins touch exactly three others. The difficulty in this problem comes from thinking of the problem in a purely 2-dimensional way, when a 3-dimensional approach is the only way to solve the problem. =Problems with insight= Insight research is problematic because of the ambiguity and lack of agreement among psychologists of its definition. This could largely be explained by the phenomenological nature of insight, and the difficulty in catalyzing its occurrence, as well as the ways in which it is experimentally \\"triggered\\". Example of a puzzle that requires an insight from the solver. Asked what goes in the blank square, and told that it is not the number six, the solver must realise that the image represents a gear stick and the answer is \\"R\\" for \\"Reverse\\" The pool of insight problems currently employed by psychologists is small and tepid, and due to its heterogeneity and often high difficulty level, is not conducive of validity or reliability. One of the biggest issues surrounding insight problems is that for most participants, they're simply too difficult. For many problems, this difficulty revolves around the requisite restructuring or re-conceptualization of the problem or possible solutions, for example, drawing lines beyond the square composed of dots in the Nine-Dot Problem. Furthermore, there are issues related to the taxonomy of insight problems. Puzzles and problems that are utilized in experiments to elicit insight may be classified in two ways. \\"Pure\\" insight problems are those that necessitate the use of insight, whereas \\"hybrid\\" insight problems are those that can be solved by other methods, such as the trial and error. As Weisberg (1996) points out, the existence of hybrid problems in insight research poses a significant threat to any evidence gleaned from studies that employ them. While the phenomenological experience of insight can help to differentiate insight-solving from non-insight solving (by asking the respondent to describe how they solved the problem, for example), the risk that non-insight solving has been mistaken for insight solving still exists. Likewise, issues surrounding the validity of insight evidence is also threatened by the characteristically small sample sizes. Experimenters may recruit an initially adequate sample size, but because of the level of difficulty inherent to insight problems, only a small fraction of any sample will successfully solve the puzzle or task given to them; placing serious limits on usable data. In the case of studies using hybrid problems, the final sample is at even greater risk of being very small by way of having to exclude whatever percentage of respondents solved their given puzzle without utilizing insight. The Aha! effect and scientific discovery There are several examples of scientific discoveries being made after a sudden flash of insight. One of the key insights in developing his special theory of relativity came to Albert Einstein while talking to his friend Michele Besso: However, Einstein has said that the whole idea of special relativity did not come to him as a sudden, single eureka moment, and that he was \\"led to it by steps arising from the individual laws derived from experience\\". Similarly, Carl Friedrich Gauss said after a eureka moment: \\"I have the result, only I do not yet know how to get to it.\\" Sir Alec Jeffreys had a eureka moment in his lab in Leicester after looking at the X-ray film image of a DNA experiment at 9:05 am on Monday 10 September 1984, which unexpectedly showed both similarities and differences between the DNA of different members of his technician's family. Within about half an hour, he realized the scope of DNA profiling, which uses variations in the genetic code to identify individuals. The method has become important in forensic science to assist detective work, and in resolving paternity and immigration disputes. It can also be applied to non-human species, such as in wildlife population genetics studies. Before his methods were commercialised in 1987, Jeffreys' laboratory was the only centre carrying out DNA fingerprinting in the world.

It is a white conical stone tower with a broad black band.  History  Kampen lighthouse in 1895 The village of Kampen in 1894 as seen from atop the lighthouse. When Sylt belonged to the Danish realm in 1853, King Frederick VII ordered the construction of a lighthouse on Sylt's highest elevation, the red cliff. The tower was first lit in 1856. Its original petroleum lantern was at the time a technical revolution and was displayed at the Paris World Exhibition in 1855. The tower was originally constructed from yellow Bornholm bricks and was reinforced with iron rings in 1875. Until 1953, the lighthouse used to be greyish-yellow, the colour of the whithered bricks. Only then was it painted with its characteristic black and white. In the early years after its inauguration, the facility became popular with locals and tourists. Specifically, guest books from the 1970s and 80s bear witness to this. Unlike today, the tower could then still be accessed and visited by the public and provided views across the island. In 1929 the so far greatest modification was made when the entire lantern house was altered and the light source was changed from petroleum to electricity. There are no lighthouse keepers any more since 1977, like all active lights on Sylt, the Kampen lighthouse is remotely controlled by a time switch in Koblenz. It is lit an hour prior to sunset and doused one hour after sunrise. Only once in its 150 years of existence, the lighthouse was severely threatened. Wehrmacht plans proposed the expansion of an airfield on the nearby Braderup heath and the tower would have to be detonated. With the occupation of Denmark and Norway in 1940 these plans became obsolete though as the strategic importance of Sylt had significantly decreased. From 2004 to 2005 the lighthouse was elaborately renovated and was therefore completely scaffolded for several months. On 4 June 2006, the 150th anniversary was celebrated with a Turmfest and the rare opportunity was provided to scale the newly renovated tower. Admission tickets were drawn.  In popular culture  Due to its characteristic black and white marking the tower has become a popular motive for painters.

Redman. Retrieved 7 September 2008 Biography Dawes was born in 1918 in Mackworth which is within Derbyshire, but he was brought up in Elvaston where his father was the vicar of Elvaston and Thulston. He had four siblings who were all older than he was. Dawes lived at Thurleston Hall, the vicarage for Elvaston. This hall had previously been the home of William Darwin Fox. His prep school was in the next village of Shardlow, where he studied until he started at Repton School which was still within south Derbyshire. This association with Repton continued as later he would become both a member and later chair of their governors. As World War II was beginning, he gained a place at Oxford University, eventually achieving a 1st in physiology in 1943. Suffering from asthma, he was considered exempt from conscription, and by 1943 had completed his clinical training. Unable to go into the military, he joined J H Burn in the department of pharmacology, treating the sort of diseases and complaints that soldiers of the front suffered from during World War I, like gas gangrene and nerve gas exposure. When the war ended, he was awarded a Rockefeller travelling fellowship, travelling to America to work at Harvard University and in Philadelphia. He returned to work in Oxford on a Foulerton Royal Society research fellowship. Career Dawes became the director of the Nuffield Institute for Medical research in Oxford in 1948 only five years after obtaining his degree in medicine,Historical Perspectives ‚Äì Perinatal Profiles: Geoffrey S. Dawes: A Neonatologist's Appreciation, NeoReviews Vol. 8 No. 9 2007 e365. Retrieved 7 September 2008 and where he worked for the next 37 years, and setting the Institutes research focus on developmental physiology. Following his appointment as director Dawes had to decide on an area of research that was worthy of his attention. He decided on fetal physiology as he thought at the time that study of fetuses would allow researchers to study simpler version of more complex adult physiology. This was not the case and Dawes himself became a spokesman for the importance and complexity of this stage of physiology. His initial research was conducted into the distribution and control of fetal circulation, mostly in unborn lamb fetus. He studied chemoreceptors, the biological mechanism that start the changes in birth. In particular he studied the onset of breathing, for the implications for human physiology, and changes in the pulmonary and systemic circulations. Dawes was one of the first paediatricians to observe that lamb fetus had sleep cycles as well as breathing cycles In utero. Studies also included the responses to stresses such as hypoxia and hemorrhage. Using this research, he was able to determine and later confirm that human fetus also slept in cycles. This led Dawes to consider the role of the central nervous control, not only in relation to sleep states, but also heart rate variability and responses to the stimulation of chemoreceptors. Using his research Dawes designed a system of measurement, used in obstetric departments around the world, as the most precise non- invasive way of assessing the well-being of the human fetus. Dawes was awarded the Gairdner Foundation International Award in 1966 for his outstanding contributions to medical science. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in March 1971. Dawes was an editor of the British Journal of Pharmacology for many years. He won the James Spence Medal in 1969, that is awarded by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health for outstanding contributions to the advancement or clarification of paediatric knowledge, the Virginia Apgar award of the American Academy of Paediatrics, the Osler Memorial Medal of Oxford University and many more. Dawes retired in 1985 and took up the post of director of Sunley Research Centre at Charing Cross Hospital, where he worked on both the computerisation of fetal heart rates and on molecular biology. The Nuffield Institute of Medical research which he had directed became part of the Institute of Molecular Medicine, when Dawes finally retired in 1989.Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine.

It is an emerging target in cancer therapy, in particular cancers with specific genetic deficiencies.  Function  The protein encoded by this gene, FANCM displays DNA binding against fork structures and an ATPase activity associated with DNA branch migration. It is believed that FANCM in conjunction with other Fanconi anemia- proteins repair DNA at stalled replication forks, and stalled transcription structures called R-loops. The structure of the C-terminus of FANCM (amino acids 1799-2048), bound to a partner protein FAAP24, reveals how the protein complex recognises branched DNA. A structure of amino acids 675-790 of FANCM reveal how the protein binds duplex DNA through a remodeling of the MHF1:MHF2 histone-like protein complex. Mechanism by which FANCM interacts with DNA, determined by protein crystallography of DNA bound protein fragments Disease linkage Homozygous mutations in the FANCM gene are associated with Fanconi anemia, although several individuals with FANCM deficiency do not appear to have the disorder. A founder mutation in the Scandinavian population is also associated with a higher than average frequency of triple negative breast cancer in heterozygous carriers. FANCM carriers also have elevated levels of Ovarian cancer and other solid tumours FANCM as a therapeutic target in ALT cancer Expression and activity of FANCM, is essential for the viability of cancers using Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT-associated cancers). Several other synthetic lethal interactions have been observed for FANCM that may widen the targetability of the protein in therapeutic use. There are several potential ways in which FANCM activity could be targeted as an anti-cancer agent. In the context of ALT, one of the best targets may be a peptide domain of FANCM called MM2. Ectopic MM2 peptide (that acts as a dominant decoy) was sufficient to inhibit colony formation of ALT-associated cancer cells, but not telomerase-positive cancer cells. This peptide works as a dominant interfering binder to RMI1:RMI2, and sequesters another DNA repair complex called the Bloom Syndrome complex away from FANCM. As with FANCM depletion, this induces death through a ‚Äúhyper-ALT‚Äù phenotype. An in vitro high-throughput screen for small molecule inhibitors of MM2-RMI1:2 interaction lead to the discovery of PIP-199. This experimental drug also showed some discriminatory activity in killing of ALT-cells, compared to telomerase-positive cells. Meiosis A current model of meiotic recombination, initiated by a double-strand break or gap, followed by pairing with an homologous chromosome and strand invasion to initiate the recombinational repair process. Repair of the gap can lead to crossover (CO) or non-crossover (NCO) of the flanking regions. CO recombination is thought to occur by the Double Holliday Junction (DHJ) model, illustrated on the right, above. NCO recombinants are thought to occur primarily by the Synthesis Dependent Strand Annealing (SDSA) model, illustrated on the left, above. Most recombination events appear to be the SDSA type. Recombination during meiosis is often initiated by a DNA double- strand break (DSB). During recombination, sections of DNA at the 5' ends of the break are cut away in a process called resection. In the strand invasion step that follows, an overhanging 3' end of the broken DNA molecule then \\"invades\\" the DNA of a homologous chromosome that is not broken forming a displacement loop (D-loop). After strand invasion, the further sequence of events may follow either of two main pathways leading to a crossover (CO) or a non-crossover (NCO) recombinant (see Genetic recombination and Homologous recombination). The pathway leading to a NCO is referred to as synthesis dependent strand annealing (SDSA). In the plant Arabidopsis thaliana FANCM helicase antagonizes the formation of CO recombinants during meiosis, thus favoring NCO recombinants. The FANCM helicase is required for genome stability in humans and yeast, and is a major factor limiting meiotic CO formation in A. thaliana. A pathway involving another helicase, RECQ4A/B, also acts independently of FANCM to reduce CO recombination. These two pathways likely act by unwinding different joint molecule substrates (e.g. nascent versus extended D-loops; see Figure). Only about 4% of DSBs in A. thaliana are repaired by CO recombination; the remaining 96% are likely repaired mainly by NCO recombination. Sequela-Arnaud et al. suggested that CO numbers are restricted because of the long-term costs of CO recombination, that is, the breaking up of favorable genetic combinations of alleles built up by past natural selection. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, FANCM helicase also directs NCO recombination during meiosis.

Biography Trap, 1968, Tate Modern Pino Pascali was born on October 19, 1935 in Bari, Italy. In 1955, Pascali left the science-oriented school that he attended in Bari, and went to a secondary school specialized in the arts in Naples. Later, in 1956, he enrolled at the Accademia di Belle Arti di Roma, on the scenic design course held by Peppino Piccolo with the help of his assistant Fabio Vergoz. He also studied under the guidance of Toti Scialoja, whose open teaching approach encouraged students to experiment with diverse mediums and forms. In the context of the Accademia, Pascali met fellow Arte Povera artist Jannis Kounellis. Pascali also took part in a number of collective shows for young artists: 1956, the Painting Exhibition at the Istituto Tommaseo di Tivoli; 1956, Second Exhibition \\"Pennello d'argento\\" at the Circolo Culturale dell Vittorie in Rome; 1959, Scenic Design Show, at the 2nd Festival dei Due Mondi in Spoleto. Before Pascali graduated in 1959 he worked as an assistant scenic designer in many RAI productions and additionally collaborated with the Studio Saraceni, Lodolofilm and Incom as a set designer, graphic design, scriptwriter, and creative writer for television advertising, making sketches, creating characters and shorts for the ads. In the early 1960s, Pascali exhibited his sculptures in a number of art exhibitions. In 1965 Pascali exhibited at Galleria La Tartaruga. In January 1968, he had an exhibition at the Galleria Ars Intermedia in Cologne, Germany. Pascali died at the age of thirty-two on September 11, 1968 in Rome, Italy, following a tragic motorcycle accident. His short career has served as an important contribution to post-war art.  Works In 1965, Pascali had a solo exhibition at the Galleria La Tartaruga in Rome, Italy.\\"Artist Pino Pascali\\", Gagosian, Retrieved 18 October 2018. It was through this exhibition that he first showed his ‚Äúfake sculptures,‚Äù a series of shaped-canvases that first appear to be solid sculptures but are actually paintings that present abstract forms suggesting animals, plants and landscapes. One of Pascali's \\"fake sculptures\\" was Decapitazione delle giraffe, or Decapitation of the giraffes. Here a structure of wood was created to resemble a skeleton which was then covered with canvas to represent skin. Other sculptures in this series included, Decapitazione della sculptura or Decapitation of the sculpture, (1966), and Mare or Sea, (1966). Pascali's other works involving canvas include Grande bacino di donna, mons Venus, ( Large woman's pelvis, mons Venus) 1964, and Labbra rosse, ( Red lips) 1964. These works were large flat canvases that became three-dimensional sculptures through the use of wooden structures, paint, and other materials, though they were still able to be hung on the wall. Many of these sculptures were references to popular culture of the time. Soon before, Pascali had created his ‚ÄúArmi series,‚Äù or \\"Weaponry\\" (1965‚Äì66). Assembled from found materials and painted olive-green, these sculptures faithfully recreate every detail of the weapon it mimics. However, as the weapon cannot fire or kill, it becomes an innocent, oversized toy. The quote above by Pascali, shows the roots of the strong connection of these war items as toys to a strong war presence in his childhood. Opposite to the ‚ÄúArmi series‚Äù in appearance, Pascali presented organic forms in a dream-like universe that, like the ‚Äúfake sculptures,‚Äù play on the relationship between illusion and reality. Another famous sculpture by Pascali is the 32 m¬≤ di mare circa, or Approximately 32 m¬≤ of sea. Done in 1967 this sculpture consists of 30 shallow \\"trays\\" containing dyed blue water. These tiles were placed adjacently of the floor, except for 6 where a zig-zag path was created so that the viewer could walk through this \\"sea\\" that Pascali has created for them. This influence of the mirror-esque quality of water can be seen in his other works, Fiume, (River), Fiume con foce tripla, (River with triple estuary), Acque stagnanti, (Stagnant waters), and Canali d'irrigazione, (Irrigation canals).Christov-Bakargiev, Carolyn.

He served as president for 33 years and oversaw a period of major expansion and development of the university.  Personal life  Palmer C. Ricketts was born in Elkton, Maryland, on January 17, 1856, and was educated privately at Princeton, New Jersey. His father, also named Palmer Chamberlain Ricketts, was the founder of the local newspaper, the Cecil Whig. His brother, Louis Davidson Ricketts, achieved prominence as a mining engineer and in finance in Arizona. He was married in 1902 to Vjera Renshaw of Baltimore.  Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute  Ricketts first arrived at RPI in 1871, at only fifteen years of age, where he joined the Alpha chapter of Theta Xi Fraternity as their 84th brother. He was an average student and participated in few campus activities, the exception being his membership on the editorial board of the 1874 edition of the Transit, the school yearbook. His graduating thesis was titled, \\"Review of the Substructure of the Wrought Iron Girder Bridge over the Hudson River at Troy.\\" Immediately following his graduation in 1875, Ricketts was appointed as Assistant in Mathematics and Astronomy at RPI. Ricketts was promoted to Assistant Professor in 1882 and in 1884 became the William H. Hart Professor of Rational & Technical Mechanics, the first endowed chair at the Institute. He was described in the campus newspaper, The Rensselaer Polytechnic, as \\"one of the most popular instructors in the Institute, a man whom we have honored for years, and whom we expect to see bringing great credit to his Alma Mater in his present position.\\" In 1892, he was appointed director of the Institute, a position that put him in charge of the faculty. During this time, he expanded the curriculum by adding an electrical engineering program. He also worked to improve recognition and support of the Institute through various publicity efforts, such as a display of alumni work at the 1893 Columbian Exposition in Chicago. He was elected president in 1901 by unanimous consent of the board of trustees, replacing John H. Peck after his resignation. During his administration he pushed for major expansion of the student body and campus; under his tenure, ten major academic buildings and twenty-nine dormitory units were constructed, now commonly referred to as the \\"green roof campus\\" due to the easily recognizable brick colonial revival architecture and copper roofs. Ricketts further expanded the Institute's curriculum, adding degree programs in mechanical, chemical, metallurgical, aeronautical and industrial engineering as well as a school of architecture in 1929. To fund these developments, Ricketts successfully solicited money from various groups and individuals, most notably a $1 million gift from Margaret Olivia Sage in 1906. Another large contribution of $5 million over several years came from John M. Lockhart, a member of the class of 1887, who was a Pittsburgh steel maker, financier and a son of a founder of Standard Oil. Lockhart was only discovered to be the contributor after his death, having given his money using the pseudonym \\"Builder.\\" Overall, he presided over the growth of Rensselaer's resources from less than $500,000 to more than $11 million. Enrollment increased from around 200 to 1,900, and the number of faculty increased correspondingly. Ricketts organized the Institute's 100th Anniversary celebration in 1934, which was attended by dignitaries from around the world. He wrote the first three editions of History of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute; the first edition of was published in 1895, the second in 1914, and the third in 1934. In 1933, he began the construction of a building for the aeronautical, chemical and metallurgical engineering departments, but did not live to see its completion in 1935, as he died in office on December 9, 1934. It was named the Ricketts Building in his honor. He was inducted into RPI's Alumni Hall of Fame in 1998.  Career  Palmer C. Ricketts served as an assistant engineer for the Troy and Boston Railroad Company during the summers of 1876 and 1877, and was later elected an honorary member of the American Society of Civil Engineers and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. From 1891 to 1892, he served as chief engineer for the Troy Public Improvement Commission, helping the city design new water and sewage systems. In 1897 and 1898, Ricketts was a consulting engineer for flood control for the River Commission of Corning, New York. Ricketts and his wife were both active in local affairs, and Ricketts himself served as director of the Troy Chamber of Commerce from 1900 to 1902. In 1933, just one year before he would die in office, he was honored as \\"the most outstanding citizen of Troy.\\" References External links * Presidents of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute 1856 births 1934 deaths Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute alumni Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute faculty People from Elkton, Maryland Members of the American Philosophical Society ","title":"Palmer C.

Simocetus is known from a single fossil, a skull, found in marine siltstone deposits of the Alsea Formation on the banks of Oregon's Yaquina River in 1977 by fossil hunter of the region, Douglas Emlong. It was first named by New Zealand paleontologist Ewan Fordyce in 2002 and contains a single species, S. rayi. He found its teeth and jaw different from any other known whale's, and thought it might have been a bottom feeder that fed by suction on marine invertebrates. Features of the basicranium and face suggest that Simocetus may have had comparable echolocation abilities to modern whales.

During the Irish Famine (1845-1849), the number of people who were poverty-stricken drastically increased and, like many other workhouses in Ireland at the time, the workhouse experienced severe overcrowding. With the introduction of the National Assistance Act 1948 and the welfare state, the workhouse closed in 1948. The buildings housed the Waterside hospital until 1991, then were redeveloped as private housing, with the main dormitory area used as a library and museum. During the redevelopment, numerous human remains were found. These remains, believed to be of people who died in the mid-nineteenth century, were later interred in the local Ballyoan cemetery. The museum opened in 1997. In 2014, the Derry City Council decided to close the museum citing health and safety issues, and decreasing visitor numbers.

Production  Indraganti debuted with the National Film Award-winning Grahanam (2005) and followed it up with Mayabazaar (2006). While working on the characters, the story became more female-centric and thereby departed from Wilde's narration. After working on the story's draft of 225 pages for about two months, he began fine-tuning it for another few months. The film was produced by Ram Mohan, his first production venture. Mohan, a management graduate from Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad, previously worked for UTV Software Communications. While Kalyani Malik was hired to compose the music and the background score, Marthand K. Venkatesh was chosen as the film's editor. The film is named after Ashta Chamma, a game from the South Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. The game, which is otherwise known as Ludo, was released as part of the film's promotion. While Indraganti wanted Bhumika Chawla to be cast in the leading role, he chose Colours Swathi in the supporting role. However, when he was unsuccessful in hiring Chawla for the film, he promoted Swathi to the lead role. Swati held a good opinion about Indraganti, whom she thought to be quite an educated director. After confirming Swathi for the role, Indraganti was scouting for three more actors to form the primary cast. During this period, Swathi completed the Tamil film, Subramaniapuram.

Centred on the town of Cheadle, Staffordshire and its outlying villages it lies to the east of Stoke-on-Trent and the much larger North Staffordshire Coalfield. The area has been mined for many years, with documentary evidence from Croxden Abbey citing coal mining in the 13th century. Deep mining ceased in 1965 with the closure of Foxfield Colliery by the National Coal Board. Private adit mining and opencast mining ceased in 1994 with the exhaustion of economic reserves.  Geology  The Cheadle Coalfield covers an area of about and lies to the East of Stoke on Trent and its larger neighbour, the North Staffordshire Coalfield. The boundary of the coalfield in the west is the Village of Forsbrook, and nearby Callow Hill where a small fault marks the western boundary. The coalfield then underlies the villages of Dilhorne and Kingsley. Further east a major fault in the Churnet Valley throws the coal upwards. Over millions of years the upper seams in this area were washed away and the lower seams outcrop around Ipstones, Foxt and Alton. The coalfield's eastern boundary is the Millstone Grit and Limestone of the Pennines around Ipstones Edge. Despite the coalfield being detached from its much larger neighbour, the North Staffordshire Coalfield, and developing from the latter in relative isolation, geological analysis by the National Coal Board in the mid 20th century correlated the coal seams of the two coalfields. Around the coalfield the measures are covered with alluvium and marl with sizeable amounts of industrial sand, gravel and limestone predominating in certain areas. The Sherwood sandstone group is the predominant rock that occurs, and comprises up to 205m of conglomerates and sandstone with scattered siltstone and mudstone. Within the area the Sandstone group has been subdivided into three lithostratigraphic formations, and quarrying for aggregates and minerals is an important industry around the coalfield area. The coal is found at a shallow depth which made mining in the area relatively easy. As the coal outcrops around the Cheadle area, the seams that were heavily worked are the deeper seams in the North Staffs field, in many cases seams that were too deep to mine economically in North Staffordshire. However they were found in shallow depths around Cheadle.  History  The coal measures around Cheadle were worked for a number of centuries and there is documentary evidence that the coal was worked before the 17th century. Dr Robert Plot, a Don from Oxford visited the area in the 1680s whilst surveying for a book he was writing on Staffordshire and encountered Coal Mining around Cheadle and Kingsley. George Barrow, a nineteenth Century geologist who did a survey of the Coalfield said that: :The district possesses a peculiar interest on account of the great antiquity of these workings, they can be traced back as far at least of the reign of Richard III. The industry, however, had its heyday during the 19th century. The 1880 edition of the Ordnance Survey plan of the area shows 66 coal mines, along with a number of Ironstone mines. Mining around Cheadle was done on a relatively small scale compared with the nearby Potteries and many of the miners knew the owners of the mines, as most were owned by local landowners. In particular, the Whitehurst and Bamford families owned collieries around the Dilhorne area in a partnership. Their biggest concern was the Dilhorne Colliery, which was a large pit and incorporated the Old Engine Colliery, one of the first in Cheadle to have a Steam Engine. The Bowers family of Harewood Hall were local coalmasters for a number of years and originally owned the famous Woodhead Colliery.Robert Plant, a local character who was involved in many local mining ventures. The industry gradually reduced in size in the early 20th century and by the late 1930s the only two deep mines left were Foxfield Colliery and New Haden Colliery. Both were fairly large mines for Cheadle and were very modern. Foxfield was heavily modernised during the 1930s when it was decided to close Parkhall Colliery and concentrate production at Foxfield, mainly due in part to the rail connection the colliery had to the Stoke - Derby railway line at Blythe Bridge. Extensive new surface facilities were built and, in what was unique for Cheadle, Concrete headgears were erected. New Haden Colliery, which had the early nickname of the \\"Klondyke\\" due to the thick Woodhead coal the pit mined was one of the first mines in Staffordshire to be electrified underground and, in addition to the colliery, there was a brickworks in production.  Nationalisation to the present day  By the time of Nationalisation of the entire British Coal mining industry in 1947, Foxfield was the last deep mine in the Cheadle Coalfield. New Haden had closed in 1943 after heavy flooding underground rendered the mine uneconomic. The workforce was either transferred to Foxfield, or to Berry Hill Colliery in the Potteries. Foxfield grew steadily under the ownership of the National Coal Board until it employed nearly 600 men by the mid-1950s. Output also peaked during this period at 210,813 tons in 1954. During this time the only Coal now Mined was The Big Dilhorne in the Dilhorne 19 and 20's Faces. The pit's surface buildings were again modernised and a new shower block for the miners was constructed, along with improvements in the Coal screens and washing facilities. However, output and manpower steadily decreased from the mid '50s peak and the colliery was finally closed in 1965. The majority of the miners were transferred to Florence Colliery in Longton, where a fully mechanised face in the Moss seam was prepared for the Cheadle miners. Some miners also transferred to Hem Heath Colliery in Trentham. Foxfield was the last deep mine in the Cheadle Coalfield and had worked for 83 years, which was a record for a Cheadle pit. It had also stretched its boundaries further than any other pit in the coalfield and was indeed a worthy colliery and one that Cheadle should be very proud of. The last face that was worked at Foxfield was Dilhorne 21's,which lies under the Dilhorne Rocks area. Ironically, and considering the scale of the coal industry in Staffordshire, the winding gear and surface buildings at Foxfield still exist to this day and are owned by the Foxfield Steam Railway who run heritage steam traction to the former colliery along the branch line from their base at Blythe Bridge. After the end of deep mining, coal was mined in Cheadle right up until the mid-1990s by opencast mining methods. There were also a few small adit, or drift, mines which were situated where the coal outcropped. Until the end of deep Coal Mining in Staffordshire during the 1990s, Cheadle was still very much a mining town with a lot of men working at Florence and Hem Heath Collieries and, regular Buses were laid on by British Coal to transport the Cheadle Miners to work in the Potteries Coalfield.  Seams of the Cheadle Coalfield  Because the coalfield developed in isolation from the Potteries coalfield, the seam names are different from those in use in the Potteries. However, as stated earlier, the seams were correlated together in the 1950s by the analysis of marine bands. Below are the seams in the Cheadle Coalfield, the shallowest at the top. However, the shallow seams in the Potteries don't exist in Cheadle, having been washed away millions of years ago. The equivalent seam in the Potteries coalfield is shown in brackets, and the approximate thickness is shown in feet. * Delphouse (Bellringer) 2'6\\" * Two Yard (10 Feet) 5'0\\" * Getley 2'0\\" * Half Yard (Bowling Alley) 2'8\\" * Yard (Holly Lane) 3'0\\" * Litley (Hard Mine) 2'6\\" (the coal is split by a 4\\" dirt band into upper & lower Litley seams) * Four Feet (New Moss) 4'0\\" * Thin (Flatts) 1'6\\" * Little Dilhorne (Banbury) 2'8\\" * Big Dilhorne (Cockshead) 5'0\\" (also nicknamed the Cheadle, Huntley or six feet) * Blackstone 1'6\\" * Ouster (Limekiln) 0'9\\" * Parkhall Sweet (Whitehurst) 1'0\\" * Little Alecs 1'6\\" * Alecs (Bullhurst) 3'6\\" (nicknamed the stinking due to high sulphur content) * Foxfield (Winpenny) 1'0\\" (the seam is named after Foxfield wood where it outcrops, not the Pit) * Cobble (Brickiln) n/a * Rider (little Cannel Row) n/a * Woodhead (King) 3'0\\" (the most famous Coal in Cheadle) * Crabtree (Crabtree) n/a * Third Grit/sweet n/a (mainly found around the Foxt/Ipstones area) All the thicknesses are approximate. The seams are generally named after where the coal outcropped, i.e., Woodhead, Dilhorne, Foxfield, Litley, etc. Of all the coal, the Woodhead is probably the most famous in the coalfield and was the seam that was most sought after by the miners and the owners. The Dilhorne seam is famous as it was extensively worked by Foxfield Colliery right up to the closure of that pit. The Crabtree and the Third Grit were almost exclusively mined in the areas to the East of the Churnet Valley as all the other seams have long since eroded away.

She played an important role in the New York art market of the 1980s. Her first two artists, Julian Schnabel and David Salle, became internationally known, and in 1982 she had a cover story on New York magazine tagged \\"The New Queen of the Art Scene.\\"(1982-04-19),\\"The New Queen of the Art Scene\\". New York The Mary Boone Gallery has represented artists including Jean-Michel Basquiat, Barbara Kruger, Eric Fischl, Ross Bleckner, and Brice Marden. Originally based in SoHo, Boone operated two galleries, one in midtown on Fifth Avenue, the other in Chelsea. Following her 2019 conviction and sentencing to 30 months in prison for tax evasion, she indicated the intention to close both galleries. Early career (1973-1989) Boone was born and raised in Erie, Pennsylvania as a member of an immigrant Egyptian family. She studied Art History at Rhode Island School of Design and received her BFA in 1973. Deciding she did not have the skill to make it as a painter, Boone moved to New York City to study art history at Hunter College. After working as a secretary at the influential Bykert Gallery, she opened her own gallery in SoHo in 1977 to a positive reception. Her first two artists, Julian Schnabel and David Salle rapidly became popular in the Neo-expressionism movement.Cottington, David, Modern Art: A Very Short Introduction, 2005, p35. Oxford University Press, While Schnabel became a celebrity artist, Boone was recognized as a new breed of dealer; young and aggressive.McGuigan, Cathleen (1985-02-85),\\"New Art, New Money\\". The New York Times, New Art, New Money Boone was able to expand her gallery across the street in 1981 and, in 1982, secured emerging artist Eric Fischl.Finke, Nikki (2005-11-17),\\"Blame Ovitz: When Art Started Imitating Hollywood\\", LA Weekly, Boone had earned a reputation for hype and media frenzy around herself and her artists when she was featured on the cover of New York magazine that same year. The rising artist Jean-Michel Basquiat joined the Mary Boone Gallery before his well received 1984 solo show there.Raynor, Vivien (1984-05-11),\\"Art: Paintings by Jean-Michel Basquiat at Boone\\". The New York Times, Established artist Barbara Kruger was the first female artist to join Boone in 1987, surprising the art world that a leading feminist \\"deconstructivist\\" appropriation artist would join the gallery best known for aggressive neo-expressionist painting. Mary Boone was one of the most successful gallerists of her generationTittel, Cornelius (2006-05-14), \\"And then it went boom\\", Die Welt Am Sonntag. and became \\"the dealer who epitomized the speculative '80s art world.\\" She was the first dealer to require waiting lists for collectors to buy works that had not yet been produced, though some collectors were granted \\"first refusal\\". When the art market crashed in 1990, she was condemned for her role in the over-heated market of the previous decade. Boone was accused of over-hyping her artists or pushing them to release inferior works to fulfill market demand.Haas, Nancy (2000-03-05), \\"Stirring Up the Art World Again\\". The New York Times, . In a later interview with W magazine, Boone explained without any prompting, \\"I think I lost my way. It was the Eighties. I got too involved with fame and fortune.\\" Boone was on the cover of a 1982 New York Magazine story titled, The New Queen of the Art Scene. Later career (1990-today) After the 1990 art market collapse, Mary Boone avoided bankruptcy by selling some of her personal collection. Several of her big artists left for other galleries, including Salle, Marden and Georg Baselitz; though Kruger, Fischl and Bleckner remained. An Eric Fischl painting she had sold at the height of the market for $1.4 million was resold in the early 1990s for only $167,500. In 1996, the Mary Boone Gallery left SoHo and opened a midtown gallery on Fifth Avenue. She opened a second gallery in the Chelsea art district in 2000 while adding a younger generation of artists that included Will Cotton, Tom Sachs, and Inka Essenhigh. Fischl told a reporter in 2008 that Boone had \\"changed radically. Dramatically but slowly, if that's possible. She's really moved from a mono- focused, obsessive, driven character who could be bullying, infuriating, quick to argue and ultimately isolated to somebody who‚Äîthrough her spiritual development, her revelations‚Äîserves her community. In 2016, actor Alec Baldwin filed a civil suit against Boone alleging she misrepresented a Ross Bleckner painting he purchased through her six years earlier. Boone denied the claim, but in 2017 settled for a \\"seven-figure\\" amount. Boone was played by Parker Posey in Julian Schnabel's 1996 film Basquiat. Legal issues In September 2018, Boone pleaded guilty to filing false income tax returns. She reported a business loss of approximately $52,521, when the Gallery made a profit of approximately $3.7 million. Boone \\"agreed to pay more than $3 million in restitution for taxes she owes for 2009, 2010, and 2011.\\" On February 14, 2019 Boone was sentenced to thirty months in federal prison by Judge Alvin Hellerstein of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York for defrauding the IRS. Boone remarked, \\"If I'm going to be the Martha Stewart of the art world, I would hope to do it with the same humility, humor, grace, and intelligence that she did. I'm trying to be optimistic and see this as a learning experience.\\" She also announced that both locations of her eponymous gallery would close. Personal life In 1979, Boone married the German art dealer Michael Werner, with whom she has a son, Max. They later divorced.

Propulsion was provided by a three-cylinder vertical triple expansion steam engine developing and driving twin screws. The Cadmus class was an evolution of the , carrying more coal, which in turn gave a greater length and displacement. This class comprised the very last screw sloops built for the Royal Navy.

Armament The class was armed with six 4in/25pdr (1 ton) quick-firing Mk III breech loaders and four 3-pounder quick-firing breech loaders, as well as several machine guns. Fantome had her armament reduced to two QF 3-pounders for survey work, and later increased again for patrol work during World War I. Construction HMS Fantome was laid down at Sheerness Royal Dockyard in Kent on 8 January 1900, and launched on 23 March 1901 when she was christened by Miss Kennedy, daughter of Vice-Admiral Sir William Kennedy, Commander-in- Chief, The Nore. She was fitted with two Niclausse boilers manufactured by Messrs Humphrys and Tennant. Operational history Fantome was commissioned at Sheerness Dockyard on 5 June 1902 by Commander Hugh Thomas Hibbert, with a complement of 113 officers and men, for service on the North America and West Indies Station. She arrived at the station head quarters at Halifax, Nova Scotia on 13 October 1902, and later the same month visited the other head quarters at Bermuda, before going to Saint Lucia. Venezuelan Affair While serving on the North America and West Indies Station in late 1902 and early 1903, she took part in enforcing a blockade of the Venezuelan coast, where the Royal Navy contingent was led by Commodore Montgomerie in . Fantome in dry dock at Halifax c.1903 Survey ship From 1906, HMS Fantome was operated by the Royal Naval survey service and conducted survey operations in Australian waters until the outbreak of war in 1914. Transfer to the Royal Australian Navy The ship was transferred to the Royal Australian Navy on 27 November 1914 and commissioned as HMAS Fantome, but was paid off in February 1915. She was recommissioned on 27 July 1915 as a patrol vessel armed with two 4-inch and four 12-pounder guns. From September 1915 to September 1917, she operated in the Bay of Bengal and South China Sea as part of the Far East Patrol. The duty was broadly uneventful and monotonous, and only concluded after the United States entered the war.Frame & Baker, Mutiny!, p. 88 Conditions aboard were hot and cramped, vermin were rife, supplies were of low quality, and in 1916, the sloop was plagued with influenza; at one point only 19 of the 88 enlisted personnel were fit for duty.Frame & Baker, Mutiny!, pp. 88-9 In addition, the ship's commanding officer was both a strict disciplinarian and had little understanding of disciplinary regulations, and had been advised on several occasions that he had overstepped boundaries.Frame & Baker, Mutiny!, pp. 89-90 In mid 1917, the commanding officer initiated drilling practice, which was seen as an additional hardship by the sailors, particularly the overworked engine room personnel.Frame & Baker, Mutiny!, pp. 91-2 On 26 July, eight of the fifteen off-duty stokers disobeyed orders to assemble for practice, while the engine room personnel about to go on duty refused to do so until drilling practice ceased. The eight off-duty and four of the on-duty stokers were arrested and charged with mutiny: they were sentenced by court martial to two years imprisonment in Goulburn Gaol, although the sentences were later commuted.Frame & Baker, Mutiny!, p. 92 The commanding officer was criticised for his treatment of the ship's company considering the conditions they were operating in, and the British Admiralty organised the assignment of ten recruits to the ship to assist the engine room personnel.Frame & Baker, Mutiny!, pp. 92-3 From late 1917, Fantome was based at Suva, Fiji and operated in the South Pacific performing police duties. She conducted a punitive raid on Malekula in the New Hebrides in October 1918. Return to the Royal Navy Fantome paid off on 14 January 1919 and was recommissioned into the Royal Navy in April 1920 for service as a survey ship. After being converted for survey duties, the ship was heavily overcrowded (a vessel designed with a ship's company of 113 was required to carry 134 personnel in addition to surveying equipment), and post-war personnel shortages meant that a little over half the number of sailors required for general seaman duties were aboard.Frame & Baker, Mutiny!, p. 93 In November 1920, after three months surveying work on the Great Barrier Reef, Fantome returned to Cairns.Frame & Baker, Mutiny!, p. 94 The overworked general seamen hit the town hard, with seven court-martialled for drunkenness and related behaviour, while another nine deserted. An inquiry concluded that the age and condition of the sloop was inappropriate for the expected duties, and the ship was marked for replacement at earliest opportunity. Decommissioning and fate Fantome operated in Australian waters until she was paid off for disposal on 17 April 1924. Survey duties in Australian waters were taken over by . The ship was sold for scrap at Sydney on 30 January 1925. Her hull was stripped to a bare hulk and used as a barge, mainly in Tasmania. She was finally sold for demolition in 1956.

It is usually a matter of protocol at state and military occasions, and a display of patriotic sentiment at civilian events. The toast is usually initiated and recited by the host before being repeated by the assembled guests in unison; the composition varying between regions and types of gathering. Protocol of the loyal toast at UK official functions. There is sometimes a tradition of smashing a glass used for a loyal toast, so that no lesser toast can be made with it. Entry on \\"Jacobite glass\\", specially made for drinking toasts; very little remains, due to the tradition of smashing glasses after the loyal toast. Commonwealth realms Throughout the Commonwealth realms, the Loyal Toast is most commonly composed solely of the words \\"The Queen\\" or \\"The King\\" (as appropriate), though this may be elaborated with mention of the monarch's position as head of a particular state, such as in Canada, where the Canadian Armed Forces codifies the Loyal Toast as \\"Ladies and gentlemen, the Queen of Canada.\\" If the sovereign holds an honorary position within a Canadian Forces regiment, in that regiment's mess the toast is: \\"Ladies and gentlemen, the Queen of Canada, our Captain- General,\\" or whatever rank the monarch may hold. As Queen Elizabeth II is recognized as the symbolic head of the Commonwealth of Nations, at any event where the guest of honour is a dignitary from any of the 16 Commonwealth realms, the Loyal Toast is adapted to be \\"Ladies and gentlemen, The Queen, Head of the Commonwealth,\\" and should an honoured guest be from one of the other Commonwealth member-states, the Loyal Toast is to be recited as \\"Ladies and gentlemen, the Queen of Canada, Head of the Commonwealth.\\" Other unique cases exist in places such as Lancashire, where the salute may be \\"Ladies and gentlemen, The Queen, Duke of Lancaster\\"; in Jersey and Guernsey, where residents will informally say \\"La reine, notre duc\\" (\\"The Queen, our Duke\\"); on the Isle of Man, where \\"The Queen, Lord of Mann,\\" is said; in Cornwall where it is traditional to toast \\"The Queen and The Duke of Cornwall\\"Parliamentary Debates, House of Commons Official Report, Standing Committees Session 1972-73, Volume VI, H.M. Stationery Office. and at Oriel College, Oxford where members toast to \\"The Queen, our Visitor\\". Members of the Royal Family neither participate in nor respond to the Loyal Toast, and the honour may be followed by a playing of \\"God Save The Queen\\", which is either the national and/or Royal Anthem of most Commonwealth realms. When ambassadors or similarly senior representatives of other heads of state are present, it has become customary for a toast to be proposed after the Loyal Toast to \\"heads of state of other countries here represented.\\" The toast can be adapted for use at some royal foundations. For example, at Christ Church, the first toast is always \\"The Queen, Visitor of Christ Church.\\" Official etiquette dictates that the Loyal Toast may be given following either the introduction of honoured guests and opening remarks or the completion of all courses of the meal, that it be the first toast given, and that a glass of any beverage other than a cocktail be used. It is also customary not to smoke until the sovereign has been toasted. In carrying out the toast, the event's host will rise and request the audience's attention. Once accomplished and the guests are standing, the host raises his or her glass and recites the toast without any other words or music. The audience then responds to the toast by repeating \\"The Queen\\" or, in Canada, \\"La reine\\", drinking the toast, and seating themselves once more. In the Royal Navy, however, the toast is given with all attendees seated, a custom practised since King William IV, who had served as a naval officer and experienced the discomfort of standing suddenly on board a vessel at sea, authorized all in the navy to toast him while sitting down. This practice is also carried out on board the ships of the Royal Canadian Navy, so long as neither The Queen nor any other member of the Canadian Royal Family is present, in which case the toast is given while sitting only if the royal guest so requests it. The lawyers of Lincoln's Inn also traditionally take the toast sitting down, commemorating an occasion when King Charles II dined at the inn and the entire company was too drunk to stand up. Members of The Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) of Canada recite the toast standing on their chairs with one leg on the table. In the British Army several units have special privileges and are exempted from the usual practice of standing up for the toast. For example, the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards are allowed to remain seated while the Queen's Royal Hussars do not drink the toast at all. In dispute The Loyal Toast was the catalyst for international friction in 1948, when the Taoiseach (prime minister) of Ireland, then John A. Costello, made an official visit to Canada. There, at a formal function, Governor-General of Canada The Earl Alexander of Tunis steadfastly refused the directions of Irish officials to toast the President of Ireland, Se√°n T. O'Kelly, instead of the Irish king, George VI; at the time, the King fulfilled the external affairs role that normally belongs to heads of state, while the President of Ireland fulfilled an internal constitutional role. An irked and drunk Costello stated to a reporter the following day that he would prompt the Irish parliament to repeal the Executive Authority Act and declare Ireland as a republic, which was done later that year. In 2000, Captain Aralt Mac Giolla Chainnigh, a professor at the Royal Military College of Canada, petitioned to be personally excused from, amongst other displays of loyalty, having to stand and participate in the Loyal Toast. The Canadian Forces Grievance Board, the Chief of the Defence Staff, and the Federal Court of Canada all upheld the Canadian Forces' requirements that members respect the Canadian head of state and Commander-in- Chief. In Scottish Jacobite circles special very fine glassware engraved with Jacobite symbols was made to toast Charles Edward Stuart, known as Bonnie Prince Charlie, the pretender to the thrones of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland; very little remains due to the tradition of smashing glasses after the toast so that they could not be used for a lesser toast. After the defeat of the Jacobites and the exile overseas of Bonnie Prince Charlie, Jacobite Scots would stand for the loyal toast to \\"the King\\" but pass their drink over a glass or jug of water on the table symbolising \\"the king over the water\\" instead of the British monarch, as a sign of solidarity with the Jacobite cause and a protest against the Hanoverian succession. Because of this for many years finger bowls were not used on British royal tables, as some people would pass the glass over the bowl. King Edward VII authorized the use of finger bowls during his reign, deeming his dynasty to be sufficiently secure. Spain At formal occasions in the Spanish Armed Forces, the first toast is to the King of Spain. The highest-ranked officer toasts \\"Por el primer soldado de Espa√±a\\" (\\"For Spain's first soldier\\") and the concurrence answers \\"Por el Rey\\" (\\"For the King\\"). Sweden At the Nobel Banquet or other such formal events in Sweden, the first toast is usually to the Swedish sovereign. It is proclaimed by the host or, if the host is the monarch himself, the second- highest-ranking official. It is simply \\"Hans Majest√§t Konungens sk√•l\\" (\\"The toast of His Majesty the King\\"). All guests then rise, raise their glasses, and, if the sovereign is present, turn towards him and answer \\"Konungen\\" (\\"The King\\"). In wardrooms and officer's messes during formal dinners, the Royal Hymn can be sung after the Loyal Toast, even when the king is not present. United States At formal military social occasions, the first toast is traditionally to \\"the President of the United States,\\" as he is commander in chief of U.S. armed forces.https://classroom.synonym.com/ideas-for-toasts-at- military-balls-13583704.html See also * Canadian royal symbols * Honors music, including royal/presidential anthems and vice-regal salutes References Drinking culture Monarchy in Canada Monarchy in Australia Monarchy in New Zealand British monarchy Canadian Armed Forces Canadian traditions Swedish monarchy ","title":"Loyal toast"},{"id":"19219247","text":"Sir Kenneth Clinton Wheare, CMG (26 March 1907 ‚Äì 7 September 1979) was an Australian academic, who spent most of his career at Oxford University in England.

The street takes its name from former U.S. President James K. Polk. The street also has bike lanes, which were approved in 2002. San Francisco bike route 25 runs along Polk Street, and is the only North-South route suitable for casual bicycle travel within at least a mile in either direction. There is an ongoing debate on whether to increase the level of these improvements. Name Polk Street is named for James Knox Polk (November 2, 1795 ‚Äì June 15, 1849) the 11th President of the United States (1845‚Äì1849). During the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, and after the Texas annexation, Polk turned his attention to California, hoping to acquire the territory from Mexico before any European nation. The main interest was San Francisco Bay as an access point for trade with Asia. The street is sometimes still referred to by its German name Polkstrasse or Polk Strasse (\\"Stra√üe\\" being the German word for \\"street\\"), dating back to the time when it was the main commercial street for San Francisco's German immigrants. In 1912, the German community built California Hall on the corner of Polk and Turk streets, a building resembling a German-style town hall (rathaus).   A crowd walks up Polk Street during the March to Remember and Reclaim Queer Space, March 2018. Polk Gulch is the neighborhood around a section of Polk Street, and its immediate vicinity, that runs through the Nob Hill and Russian Hill neighborhoods from approximately Geary Street to Union Street. The name, somewhat humorous, arises because the street runs over an old stream at the bottom of a gently-sloped valley. Polk Gulch was San Francisco's main gay neighborhood from the 1950s until the early 1980s, although around 1970 many gays began to move to The Castro (formerly Eureka Valley) and SOMA because many large Victorian houses were available for low rent or could be purchased with low down payments. Several gay, lesbian, and transgender bars and clubs remain in the area. As the original center of the city's LGBT community, it has remained one of the core centers along with The Castro and the South of Market (SOMA). On New Year's Day 1965, police raided a gay fundraising party for the newly founded Council on Religion and the Homosexual in California Hall on Polk Street, an incident that, according to some, marked the beginning of a more formally organized gay rights movement in San Francisco. In 1972, Polk Street was the location of the first official San Francisco Gay Pride Parade. In the 1950s through the 1970s Halloween on Polk Street became a major attraction for tourists and locals. In the 1990s and 2000s the neighborhood started to gentrify. It remains prominent for its nightlife.

The etymology of the name Nostoceras comes from \\"nostos\\" meaning return and \\"ceros\\" meaning horn, named as such by Alpheus Hyatt because it bends back on itself. Taxonomy Nostoceras is the type genus for the ammonite family Nostoceratidae which is included in the Turrilitoidea. The Turrilitoidea, with Nostoceras and the Nostoceratidae, are commonly included in the suborder Ancyloceratina but may instead belong in the Turrilitina, a proposed order of heteromorphs thought to have a separate derivation, though this separation does not have wide support. Fossil record Fossils of Nostoceras are found in marine strata from the Campanian stage of the Upper Cretaceous, in the USA, England, central Europe, west Africa, Australia and Madagascar (Angola, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, England, France, Germany, Iraq, Italy, Madagascar, the Netherlands, Nigeria, Oman, Spain, United States). Description Nostoceras is typified by a tightly coiled helical spire on a large U shaped body chamber with the aperture, in mature individuals, nearly touching and lying underneath the spire. The initial helical whorls are covered with fine ribs and may have small spines. The U shaped body chamber has coarser ribbing and large tubercles. Periodic constrictions may be present on the phragmocone. Species may coil either to the left or to the right. Nostoceras is like Bostrychoceras in general form, except that its ribs may be flaired and the constrictions may or may not be present.

Kasper Theatre, or Kasperle, is the German equivalent of Punch and Judy, a traditional form of puppetry which has its origins in the Italian commedia dell'arte. History From an early age Max Jacob had been involved with the Wandervogel movement and was very interested in folk arts and folk traditions. When, in 1921, he saw a puppet show for the first time, he purchased his own puppets and gave a performance to an audience mostly made up of other friends of the Wandervogel movement. After this, he set up the Hartensteiner Puppenspiele, which was renamed Hohensteiner Puppenspiele when Jacob and many of his troupe moved to Hohnsteiner Castle in 1928, where they lived and worked together. Many audience members were also guests at the castle, which functioned not only as the troupe's home, but as a youth hostel. The troupe, as well as craftsmen and -women involved in the construction of the puppets and the staging, began to transform the style of the Kasper theatre, changing it from a fairground show, with an emphasis on slapstick humour and irreverent anti-authoritarianism, into a theatrical art with a pedagogical purpose. Jacob explained of Kasper that \\"Er tut das Moralische rein vorbildlich, er moralisiert aber nicht. Und dieses Vorbild nehmen die Kinder in sich auf\\" (He does what is moral simply by example, but he does not moralise. And the children internalise this example).Max Jacob, Wollt Ihr Kasper spielen?, p. 21 In 1933, the troupe had to leave the Hohnsteiner Castle because the Nazis had taken it over and turned it into a concentration camp. The troupe moved to a multi-family house, where they again lived and performed. The house became known as the Kasperhaus, and the troupe reconstructed it at the Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne (1937) (more notorious for the other showpiece from Nazi Germany by Albert Speer). They were awarded a Gold Medal. After this, the troupe began to make international tours, and to produce Kasper in different media (film, particularly short film, television, even radio). During the 1940s, the Hohnsteiner Puppenspiele entertained the troops, and functioned as the showpiece puppet theatre during the Nazi era. Many of Jacob's original troupe were killed in the war, or had left the troupe, so after the war Jacob and the remaining members ‚Äì as well as some new additions such as the composer Irmgard Wassmann - began afresh with the Hohnsteiner Theatre in Hamburg. During this post-war period, the troupe gave performances in prisoner of war camps, detention centres, and convalescent homes for former concentration camp inmates, and orphanages. Jacob retired from the puppet theatre in 1953 but remained close to the theatre until his death in 1967. In this time he attended conferences and seminars and in 1957 was selected as president of the international puppeteers association, UNIMA. He held this position until his death. Puppeteers such as Friedrich Arndt, Harald Schwarz and Erich K√ºrschner continued the legacy of Jacob and the Hohnsteiner Puppenspiele. Style Max Jacob's Hohnsteiner Kasper differed from the earlier fairground Kasper in its moral intention to instil \\"values\\" into its younger audience members, and in its self-definition as a theatre form rather than a fairground entertainment. In contrast to the fairground Kasper, which had borrowed from the British Punch and Judy stories that showed Punch throwing his crying baby out the window, beating his wife, as well as an array of authority figures, Jacob's Kasper was more childlike in character, as well as being wiser and on friendly terms with the policeman (Wachtmeister). Along with the slapstick element, Jacob's troupe removed bawdiness and smutty language. The Hohensteiner Kasper Theatre relied less on props and scenery than the earlier Kasper Theatre and instead used an assortment of curtains behind the figures. They also played in a room rather than on the traditional Spielleiste. They also introduced music to Kasper theatre, provided above all by one of the Hohnsteiner troupe's later additions, the composer Irmgard Wesemann, who joined them in 1945. The music gave a prominent place to the accordion, which would be played from behind the stage while Kasper himself mimed a mini-performance.

The world summit record referred to the highest mountain to have been successfully climbed. The terms are most commonly used in relation to the history of mountaineering in the Himalaya and Karakoram ranges, though modern evidence suggests that it was not until the 20th century that mountaineers in the Himalaya exceeded the heights which had been reached in the Andes. The altitude and summit records rose steadily during the early 20th century until 1953, when the ascent of Mount Everest made the concept obsolete. 19th century and before Llullaillaco was climbed by Incas before European exploration of the world's highest mountain ranges began European exploration of the Himalaya began in earnest during the mid-19th century, and the earliest people known to have climbed in the range were surveyors of the Great Trigonometric Survey (GTS). During the 1850s and 1860s they climbed dozens of peaks of over 6,100 m (20,000 ft) and several of over 6,400 m (21,000 ft) in order to make observations, and it was during this period that claims to have ascended the highest point yet reached by man began to be made. Most of these early claims have now been rendered invalid by the discovery of the bodies of three children at the 6,739 m (22,110 ft) summit of Llullaillaco in South America: Inca sacrifices dated to around AD 1500.Sale and Cleare, p.21 There is no direct evidence that the Incas reached higher points, but the discovery of the skeleton of a guanaco on the summit ridge of Aconcagua (6,962 m, 22,841 ft) suggests that they also climbed on that mountain, and the possibility of Pre-Columbian ascents of South America's highest peak cannot be ruled out. In the Himalaya yaks have been reported at heights of up to 6,100 m (20,000 ft) and the summer snow line can be as high as 6,500 m (21,300 ft). It is likely that local inhabitants went to such heights in search of game, and possibly higher while exploring trade routes, but they did not live there, and there is no evidence that they attempted to climb the summits of the Himalaya before the arrival of Europeans.Sale and Cleare, pp. 21-22 In August 1855, the Bavarian brothers Adolf and Robert Schlagintweit of the Magnetic Survey of India made an attempt to climb Kamet (7,756 m), in the Garhwal region of Uttarakhand, India, near the Tibetan border. Spending 10 days above they approached the mountain from the Tibetan side, climbing the northwest ridge of the subsidiary peak Abi Gamin. From their highest camp at , they and some of their guides and carriers reached an altitude of according to their barometric measurements, which would have put them higher than Llullaillaco. Frank Smythe, Kamet Conquered: The historic first ascent of a Himalayan giant, p. 15Moritz von Brescius, Friederike Kaiser, Stephanie Kleidt B√∂hlau, √úber den Himalaya: Die Expedition der Br√ºder Schlagintweit nach Indien und Zentralasien 1854 bis 1858, Verlag K√∂ln Weimar, 2015, pp. 25-26 Many early claims of world altitude records are muddied by incomplete surveying and lack of knowledge of local geography, which have led to reassessments of many of the heights which were originally claimed. In 1862 a khalasi (an Indian assistant of the GTS) climbed Shilla, a summit in Himachal Pradesh which was claimed to be over 7,000 m (23,000 ft) high. More recent surveys have, however, fixed its height at 6,111 m (20,049 ft).Sale and Cleare, p. 22 Three years later William Johnson of the GTS claimed to have climbed a 7,284 m (23,898 ft) peak during an illicit journey into China, but the mountain he climbed has since been measured at 6,710 m (22,014 ft).Sale and Cleare, p. 22  Above 7,000 m  Graham, Boss and Kaufmann may have climbed to 30 ft below 7,338 m Kabru N in 1883; if true they set an altitude record which stood for 26 years. The first pure mountaineers (as opposed to surveyors) to have climbed in the Himalaya were the English barrister William Graham, the Swiss hotelier Emil Boss and the Swiss mountain guide Ulrich Kaufmann, who together climbed extensively in the area in 1883. The previous year Graham had made the first ascent of the Dent du G√©ant, and Boss and Kaufmann had equally notably very nearly made the first ascent of Aoraki / Mount Cook in New Zealand. Among others, they claimed a near ascent of Dunagiri (reaching about 6,900 m), an ascent of Changabang (6,864 m, 22,520 ft) in July in the Garhwal Himalaya, and an ascent to 30 feet below the east summit of Kabru south of Kangchenjunga in October, but most of the ascents are disputed. It is not claimed that they lied about their ascents, rather that the poor quality of maps at the time may have led them to be unsure of which mountain they were actually on, and to make estimates of their height which owed more to wishful thinking than scientific measurements.Sale and Cleare, p. 23 Their description of Changabang is so at variance with the mountain itself that their claim was doubted almost immediately, and by 1955 was not taken seriously anymore. Reprinted 1987 by Diadem Books, The team's ascent over the east face of Kabru is less readily dismissed. Although their report of views of Mount Everest from the top appears convincing, Graham's description of the ascent was also vague, and this, coupled with the speed of their claimed ascent and his failure to report significant effects of altitude sickness, have led many to assume that here they also climbed a lower peak in the same area.Sale and Cleare, p. 23Mason, pp 94-95 Their claim was, however, supported in the following years by climbers such as Douglas Freshfield, Norman Collie, Edmund Garwood, Carl Rubenson, and Tom Longstaff, and more recently Walt Unsworth has argued that as a man who was more interested in climbing than in making observations, the vagueness of his description is to be expected, and that now Everest has been climbed in a single day without oxygen, his claims sound less outlandish than they once did. In 2009, Willy Blaser and Glyn Hughes wrote a spirited defense of the ascent in the Alpine Journal, arguing that Graham and Boss's criticism of the maps of the Garhwal Himalaya had led to bad blood.Willy Blaser and Glyn Hughes, Kabru 1883, a reassessment, The Alpine Journal 2009, p. 209 If Graham, Boss and Kaufmann did climb Kabru it was a remarkable achievement for its time, establishing an altitude record which was not broken for twenty-six years.Unsworth (1994) p. 235 Nine years later, another claim to the world altitude record was made by Martin Conway in the course of his expedition to the Karakoram in 1892. Together with Matthias Zurbriggen and Charles Granville Bruce, Conway made an attempt on Baltoro Kangri and on 25 August reached a subsidiary summit which he named Pioneer Peak. The barometer showed a height of 22,600 ft (6,900 m) which Conway optimistically rounded up to 23,000 ft (over 7,000 m). However, Pioneer Peak has since been measured at only . On 14 January 1897, Matthias Zurbriggen went on to make the first recorded ascent of Aconcagua in the Andes. Aconcagua is high and, if the claims of Boss and Graham are discounted, was still the highest point to have been reached at that time.Sale and Cleare, p. 24 The Duke of the Abruzzi and guides climbing an icefall on Chogolisa. It was several more years before the 7,000 m barrier would be broken with reasonable certainty. In July 1905 Tom George Longstaff, accompanied by the alpine guides Alexis and Henri Brocherel from Courmayeur and six local porters, made an attempt on Gurla Mandhata.T.G. Longstaff, An attempt to climb Gurla Mandhata, Chapter 8 in Western Tibet and the British borderland, Edward Arnold Publisher, London 1906. The height they reached is estimated at between 7,000 m (23,000 ft) and 7,300 m (24,000 ft),Mason, p. 115 greater than the height of Aconcagua. In 1907 Longstaff and the Brocherel brothers returned to the Himalayas and led an expedition with the aim of climbing Nanda Devi, but unable to penetrate its \\"sanctuary\\" of surrounding peaks turned their attention to Trisul, which they climbed on June 12.Sale and Cleare, p. 24 At Trisul became the highest summit to have been climbed whose height was accurately known and whose ascent was undisputed.Mason, p. 117 This altitude record, though not the summit record, was broken a few months later, on 20 October 1907, when the Norwegians Carl Wilhelm Rubenson and Ingvald Monrad Aas came within 50 m of ascending the 7338 m east summit of Kabru. It is noteworthy that Carl Rubenson afterwards believed that Graham, Boss and Kaufmann had ascended that summit 24 years before. An undisputed new altitude record was achieved in 1909 by the Duke of the Abruzzi's expedition to the Karakoram. After failing to make progress on K2 the Duke led an attempt on Chogolisa, where they reached a height of approximately 7,500 m (24,600 ft) before turning around just 150 m below the summit due to bad weather and the risk of falling through a cornice in poor visibility.Curran p. 70 The undisputed summit record, though not the altitude record, was broken by 8 meters on June 14, 1911, when the Scottish chemist, explorer, and mountaineer Alec Kellas together with the Sherpas \\"Sony\\" and \\"Tuny's brother\\" climbed the high Pauhunri on the border of Sikkim and Tibet. Until the late 20th century this mountain was thought to be only , so this record was not realized at the time.\\"Scottish climber revealed to be altitude record-breaker ‚Äì 80 years on\\" CaledonianMercury.com. Retrieved 2011-11-24. British Everest expeditions The world altitude record was not broken again until the British expeditions to Mount Everest, and would then become the exclusive preserve of climbers on the world's highest mountain. On the 1922 expedition the record was broken twice. On 20 May, George Mallory, Howard Somervell and Edward Norton reached on the mountain's North Ridge, without using supplemental oxygen. Three days later George Finch and Geoffrey Bruce, using supplemental oxygen, followed the same route and went even higher‚Äîturning around at about when Bruce's oxygen apparatus failed.Unsworth (2000), pp. 91-95 The North Face of Mount Everest, scene of the British expeditions of the 1920s and 30s In 1924 the British made another attempt on Everest, and the world altitude record was again broken. On 4 June, Edward Norton, without supplemental oxygen, reached a point on the mountain's Great Couloir high, his companion Howard Somervell having turned around a short distance before.Unsworth (2000), pp. 120-122 This was an altitude record which would not be broken, with certainty, until the 1950s, or without supplemental oxygen until 1978. Three days later George Mallory and Andrew Irvine disappeared while making their own attempt on the summit. There has been much debate over whether they reached a greater height than Norton, or even the summit, but as there is no direct proof they are not generally credited with a record. The British made several further expeditions to Mount Everest in the 1930s. Twice in 1933 climbing parties reached approximately the same point as Norton; first Lawrence Wager and Percy Wyn-Harris, and later Frank Smythe, but there was no advance on Norton's record.Unsworth (2000), pp. 158-184 Inter-war years Nanda Devi was the highest mountain to be climbed before the Second World War. While there would be no advance on the altitude record until the 1950s, the summit record was broken five times in the inter- war years. The first was by just another 6 meters, when on 15 September 1928 the German mountaineers Karl Wien and and the Austrian mountaineer and cartographer reached the summit of the Kaufman Peak in the Pamirs, a mountain up to that year thought to be the highest mountain in the Soviet Union. After the expedition, it was renamed Lenin Peak. The next advance was a by-product of the international expedition to Kanchenjunga led by G√ºnter Dyhrenfurth in 1930. The attempt on Kanchenjunga itself was abandoned after an avalanche had killed Chettan Sherpa, but members of the team stayed to climb a number of smaller peaks in the area. , who had barely escaped the avalanche, broke his own summit record twice in two weeks: on 24 May he solo-climbed Nepal Peak near Kirat Chuli, and on 3 June and he climbed Jongsong Peak, planting a Swabian and Tyrolean flag on top.Sale and Cleare, p. 24Frank Smythe, The Kangchenjunga Adventure: The 1930 Expedition to the Third Highest Mountain in the World, Vertebrate Publishing, 2013Bettina Hoerlin, Steps of Courage: My Parents' Journey from Nazi Germany to America, pp. 24-26 In 1931 the summit record was broken again with the ascent of Kamet. Frank Smythe, Eric Shipton, R.L. Holdsworth and Lewa Sherpa reached the summit on 21 June. At , Kamet was the first mountain over 7,500 m and 25,000 ft to be climbed.Sale and Cleare, pp. 24-25 The summit record was raised once more before the Second World War brought an effective halt to mountaineering in the Himalaya. Nanda Devi, at the highest mountain wholly within the British Empire, had been the object of several expeditions, and it was finally climbed on 29 August 1936 by Bill Tilman and Noel Odell.Sale and Cleare, p. 25 1950s and ascent of Everest Annapurna, the first summit over 8000 m to be reached. After the Second World War, the formerly closed and secretive kingdom of Nepal, wary of the intentions of the People's Republic of China and seeking friends in the West, began to open its borders. For the first time its peaks, including the south side of Everest, became accessible to Western mountaineers, triggering a new wave of exploration.Sale and Cleare, p. 28 There was one further improvement on the summit record before Everest was conquered. On 3 June 1950 Annapurna (8,091 m, 26,545 ft) became the first 8,000 m mountain to be climbed when the French climbers Maurice Herzog and Louis Lachenal reached its summit on the 1950 French Annapurna expedition. Both Herzog and Lachenal lost their toes to frostbite; Herzog also lost most of his fingers.Sale and Cleare, pp. 31-36 The upper slopes of Mount Everest. The Southeast Ridge followed by the expeditions of the 1950s forms the right hand skyline and the South Summit, marking the last altitude record to be set before the mountain's first ascent, is visible below and right of the main summit. The first attempt to climb Everest from the south was made by a Swiss team in 1952. The expedition's high point was reached by Raymond Lambert and the team's Nepali Indian sardar Tenzing Norgay on 26 May, when they reached a point approximately 200 m (650 ft) below the South Summit before turning around in the knowledge that they would not reach the summit in daylight. Their estimated height of 8,600 m (28,210 ft) was slightly higher than the previous altitude record set by the British on the north side of the mountain.Unsworth (2000), pp. 289-290 The Swiss made further attempts later in May, and again in autumn after the monsoon, but did not regain Lambert and Tenzing's high point. Mount Everest was climbed the following year. On 26 May, three days before the successful attempt, Tom Bourdillon and Charles Evans reached the South Summit before turning back due to malfunctioning oxygen apparatus. Their height of 8,760 m (28,750 ft) represented a new, short lived, altitude record, and can be seen as a summit record if this is taken to include minor tops as well as genuine mountains.Unsworth (2000), p. 329 Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay finally reached the 8,848 m (29,029 ft) true summit on 29 May 1953, marking the final chapter in the history of the mountaineering altitude record.Unsworth (2000), pp. 334-337 While the exact height of Everest's summit is subject to minor variation due to the level of snow cover and the gradual upthrust of the Himalaya, significant changes to the world altitude record are now impossible. Women's altitude record Fanny Bullock Workman Female mountaineers were rare in the early 20th century, and the maximum height attained by a woman lagged behind that claimed by male climbers. The first woman to climb extensively in the Karakoram was Fanny Bullock Workman, who made a number of ascents, including that of Pinnacle Peak, a subsidiary summit of Nun Kun, in 1906. Her claim on the women's altitude record was challenged by Annie Smith Peck in 1908 after she made an ascent of the north peak of Huascar√°n, which she claimed was higher than Pinnacle Peak. The ensuing controversy was bitter and public, and eventually resolved in Bullock Workman's favour when she hired a team of surveyors to measure the height of Huascar√°n. The north peak was found to be tall - some 600 m lower than Smith Peck's estimate.Jordan, pp. 6-7 In 1934 Hettie Dyhrenfurth, wife of G√ºnter Dyhrenfurth, became the first woman to exceed 7000 m when she climbed Sia Kangri (). Her summit record would stand for 40 years, though her altitude record was broken by the French climber Claude Kogan, who reached approximately on Cho Oyu in 1954.Jordan, p. 7 The following year saw the first all-female team to visit the Himalayas, made up of Monica Jackson, Evelyn McNicol and Elizabeth Stark, making the first ascent of Gyalgen Peak, .Elizabeth Stark, Jugal Himal, The Himalayan Journal 19 (1956). The height is for Gyalsten Peak on the Finn Topographic Map of Nepal 2885-16, which corresponds exactly with the description and picture in the article by Stark The first female ascent of an 8000 m peak came in 1974, when three Japanese women, Masako Uchida, Mieko Mori and Naoko Nakaseko climbed Manaslu, at . A year later Junko Tabei of Japan made the first female ascent of Mount Everest on 16 May 1975.

Previous career  Currie began his journalistic career as a teenager at The Evening Post in Wellington, where he won the national award for crime reporting. He subsequently worked on newspapers including The Press in Christchurch and The Sunday Star-Times, which were all part of the same media group, Independent Newspaper Limited (INL), ultimately owned by Australian newspaper magnate Rupert Murdoch. Currie was at The Sunday Star-Times when Murdoch sold his New Zealand newspaper holdings to John Fairfax Holdings, another Australian newspaper publishing company. Currie rose to deputy editor at the Star-Times, then New Zealand's highest-circulating paper. After Suzanne Chetwin resigned as Star-Times editor in 2003, Currie led the newspaper in an acting capacity until the appointment of Cate Brett as editor. He has won numerous journalism awards. In July 2004 he resigned from the Star-Times to work on a special project for APN News & Media, a rival media group that owned The New Zealand Herald and a range of provincial newspapers, magazines and radio stations. That special project was subsequently revealed as the Herald on Sunday, another Sunday newspaper. Currie was appointed deputy editor to Suzanne Chetwin.  Editorship  Currie took up the editorship of the Herald on Sunday on 1 February 2005, again succeeding Chetwin. On 8 August 2005 he addressed the 2005 PANPA annual conference in Cairns, Australia, on how launching a newspaper can change an entire market. He spoke shortly after Kevin Rudd, subsequently elected prime minister of Australia. Under his leadership, the Herald on Sunday has been the only major newspaper in New Zealand to consistently increase its circulation, selling 93,665 papers each week in the audit period ended June 2008. When the figures were published, Currie said: \\"In the three years since the launch of the Herald on Sunday, the newspaper has found its voice, attracting new Sunday newspaper buyers to what is the most competitive newspaper market in the country. We owe a huge debt to those who stuck with us in our early days, and to those readers who have picked us up for the first time, or more frequently, over the past 12 months. We've listened to what readers liked ‚Äì and didn't like ‚Äì and evolved accordingly.\\" On 9 May 2008 Currie accepted the Qantas Award for Newspaper of the Year for the Herald on Sunday. The judges said the award was an extraordinary achievement for a paper that had been launched only four years' earlier. In August 2008 the Nielsen Media Research National Readership Survey showed the Herald on Sunday had increased its readership by 64,000 to 390,000 ‚Äì a 19.6 per cent jump in the 12 months to 30 June 2008. Currie has gained a strong reputation as an advocate of open and transparent media, and as a critic of the cash bidding wars that can characterise popular newspaper and magazine journalism elsewhere in the New Zealand media and overseas.  Controversy  During his time as acting editor of The Sunday Star-Times, Currie was forced to defend one of his journalists charged with the theft of a videotape at the heart of drugs case involving a teacher and pupils. During a September 2003 evening one of Currie's reporters took a group of young people to dinner and drinks at the cost of the newspaper, later in the night two of the male youths went and took the video from the teacher after at least one of them performed oral sex on the teacher, a court heard. Currie was quoted at the time saying the Sunday Star-Times had acted properly. \\"The newspaper at all times was acting in good faith in a matter of extreme public interest\\", he said. \\"As a result of the newspaper's work, a teacher has been charged with supplying teenagers a class A drug. \\"We believe we have done everything right in this matter ‚Äì we handed the videotape to police before we published anything so that they could carry out their own investigation.\\" The Herald on Sunday has also earned the nickname of \\"Carcrash on Sunday\\" among some journalists and media observers for its frequent use of vehicle accidents and human tragedies as marketing tools on its front page. Later in October 2005, as editor of the Herald on Sunday, Currie discovered that one of his staff reporters, John Manukia, 38, had fabricated an interview with former south Auckland police officer Anthony Solomona. Currie dismissed Manukia and gave an upfront public apology. Further investigations revealed that Manukia had fabricated other material at the Herald on Sunday and as a reporter at another newspaper, the Fairfax-owned Sunday News. Currie wrote a candid first- person article in the Herald on Sunday of 23 October 2005, explaining what had happened and expressing his regret to readers. He drew comparisons with the actions of reporters Jayson Blair at The New York Times, and Stephen Glass at The New Republic. In 2009 Currie was sued by a former assistant editor of the Herald on Sunday for unjustified dismissal. Reporter Stephen Cook, who helped Currie launch the tabloid, was sacked in 2008 after two drug squad detectives visited the Herald on Sunday offices looking for him. Cook had reportedly been seen at an address, which was under police surveillance. On the day the case commenced Currie faced further scrutiny when The New Zealand Herald revealed examples of industrial espionage, including allegations he sent a reporter to the rival Sunday Star-Times' print site to obtain advanced copies in a bid to get stories for his own paper. The allegations were again reported in the Sunday News and Sunday Star-Times branded \\"unprecedented spying\\". Currie, and APN, won the employment case after the court found Cook's dismissal was justified because he could not adequately explain why he was at the address under surveillance.  Awards  In 2015, Currie was awarded a fellowship to Wolfson College, Cambridge, as part of the 2015 Canon Media Awards.

Using gothic horror as a platform to tell a story of fanaticism and frigid sexual mores is an intriguing, if not original, concept. It‚Äôs just a shame that it gets sandwiched inside a creative and technical mess of a film. Still if you‚Äôre into badly dubbed and low budget cinema involving sorcerers, inquisitions, comets, sexually inhibited puritans, and astronomy,\\" TV Guide awarded the film three out of five stars, calling it \\"competent and entertaining, despite the dreadful dubbing and cuts made under Murray's supervision\\". The reviewer also praised the film's expressionistic cinematography, and monster design. The Terror Trap called the film \\"hilarious fun thanks to its shameless ability to discard logic behind its pseudo sci fi plot\\" The film has developed a cult following since its cable-network TV appearance and is now considered a cult classic by younger generations.

Lewis, D. (2008). Tears of the Desert: A Memoir of Survival in Darfur Harper Collins Publishers Ltd. The autobiography tells of the life of Bashir in a village in the Darfur region of Sudan before catastrophe strikes. Synopsis Bashir grew up in a rural Zaghawa village in the Darfur region. Her father was wealthy enough to send her to a city school where she excelled as a student. Bashir went on to study medicine and became a doctor. Working in the emergency ward at the hospital in Hashma, Bashir treated patients from both sides of the war. During her time in Hashma, Bashir gained a reputation as a doctor all victims of the conflict could rely on for treatment, regardless of race. She was soon transferred by the government to Mazkhabad, a remote village in Northern Darfur. There, she treated forty-two young school girls and their teachers who were brutally gang-raped in a government supported attack on the village. For speaking out about this attack to United Nations investigators, Bashir herself was brutally tortured and raped. Bashir returned to her home village only to watch it be destroyed by government helicopters and militia. Shortly after, Bashir fled the country with the understanding that the government was still hunting her. Details When Bashir attends secondary school in the city, she comes up against traditional enmities between the black Africans of Darfur and the minority Arab elite and their group's subsequent discrimination against the black Africans ever since. She accounts for the lack of support from teachers in physical fights stemming from schoolgirl prejudices that leads to expulsion ‚Äì all of it an early lesson in helplessness. 7 September 2008 Co-author Damien Lewis stated that one of his goals was to, \\"make ‚Ä¶ you or I or anybody else in the West feel that that could be them ‚Ä¶ how would they feel if that happened to them brings it home to on the personal human family level.

Development For the first film, Richard Rickitt explains that to \\"produce the characters who inhabit the computer world, actors were dressed in costumes that were covered in black-and-white computer circuitry designs....With coloured light shining through the white areas of their costumes, the resulting characters appeared to glow as if lit from within....optical processes were used to create all of the film's computerized characters...\\" Frederick S. Clarke reported that Tron: Legacy would \\"combine live action with Computer-generated imagery (CGI),\\" adding that \\"several characters...will be completely digital...\\" Tron Kevin Flynn Kevin Flynn is a former employee of the fictional software company ENCOM and the protagonist of the first film. He is played by Jeff Bridges. At the start of the first film, he owns \\"Flynn's\\", a video arcade where he impresses his patrons with his skills at games that (unknown to them) he designed at ENCOM, but remains determined to find evidence that CEO Ed Dillinger plagiarised Flynn's work to advance his position within the company. Throughout most of the film, Flynn travels around the digital world, accompanying the eponymous character Tron; but later discovers that as a User, he commands the physical laws of the digital world which empowers him beyond the abilities of an ordinary program. Eventually, he enables Tron to destroy the Master Control Program shown to oppress the digital world, and upon return to the material world obtains the evidence necessary to expose Dillinger, and becomes ENCOM's CEO himself. =Clu= Clu (short for Codified Likeness Utility) is a hacking program created by Flynn, with his likeness, to expose Dillinger's plagiarism. In the film, he is seen operating a tank in the search to uncover the stolen data, but is captured by the Master Control Program and absorbed into it. The information gained from Clu is subsequently used against Flynn as he tries to escape the game grid on a light cycle. Alan Bradley Alan Bradley is a computer programming working partner of Kevin Flynn at ENCOM. He is portrayed by Bruce Boxleitner. At the start of the first film, he creates the Tron program that monitors communications between the MCP and the real world, but finds its progress confined. As a result, he assists Flynn in exposing Dillinger. In the film, Tron addresses Alan with the username 'Alan-One'. =Tron= Tron is a security program created by Alan, with his likeness, to monitor communications between the MCP and the real world. He is the main digital protagonist of the first film. In the film, he is captured by the MCP and forced to play on the Game Grid, but freed by Flynn and instructed by Alan to shut down the MCP. His code number is \\"JA-307020\\". Lora Baines Lora Baines is a research engineer at ENCOM, the ex-girlfriend of Kevin Flynn and then-current girlfriend of Alan Bradley. She is played by Cindy Morgan. She works as one of the assistants of Walter Gibbs in the designing of the laser that teleports Kevin Flynn into the digital world, and creates the Yori program that assists in the derezzing procedure. =Yori= Yori is an input/output program created by Baines, with her likeness, to take charge of the creation of digital simulations (such as the Solar Sailer) and assist with the de-rezzing procedure of the digitizing laser. The romantic interest of Tron and Flynn, Yori is reunited with Tron after he rescues her from the clutches of the MCP, and helps Tron and Flynn reach its core, where their combined efforts destroy the MCP and its factional programs. Walter Gibbs Walter Gibbs is the founder of ENCOM, where he continues to work at as a scientist along with Lora Baines, working on the teleporting laser. After voicing concerns about heavy restriction to the company mainframe computer in a meeting with Ed Dillinger, Dillinger responds by threatening him with being dismissed. He is portrayed by Barnard Hughes. =Dumont= Dumont is a \\"guardian\\" program created by Dr. Gibbs, with his likeness, to protect the ENCOM mainframe's I/O Tower. He even has a similar closeness with Yori that Gibbs had with her user, Lora Baines. Ed Dillinger Ed Dillinger is the Senior Executive Vice President of ENCOM and the main antagonist of the first film. He is played by David Warner. Dillinger was a worker in ENCOM before plagiarizing Kevin Flynn's original work, after which he becomes the company's senior executive. He contributes to the rise of the Master Control Program that controls the ENCOM mainframe and creates the Sark program that acts as the MCP's second-in-command. Dillinger authorizes the MCP to tighten security controls upon learning of Flynn's seeking evidence of the theft of his work, but when he starts questioning the MCP's intent to defy his plans of capturing other programs, the MCP threatens to expose Dillinger's misdeeds. He is defeated and indeed disgraced when the MCP is destroyed, yet also relieved that the MCP is no more. His son Ed Dillinger, Jr. appears in the beginning of Tron: Legacy in a minor role, portrayed by an uncredited Cillian Murphy. =Sark= Commander Sark is a command program created by Dillinger, with his likeness, to serve as chief lieutenant of the MCP and the secondary digital antagonist of the first film. He oversaw the training of new programs kidnapped and brought to the Game Grid by the MCP, and was known to enter the games himself from time to time. He is destroyed by Tron near the end of the film. In the novelization, his code number is \\"ES-1117821\\". Master Control Program The Master Control Program (MCP), voiced by David Warner and also played by Barnard Hughes, is the main digital antagonist of the first film. It is an artificial intelligence created by ENCOM founder Walter Gibbs and improved by Ed Dillinger that ruled Encom's mainframe computer. During the rule of the MCP, many programs are enslaved and forced to play games against its henchmen. To gain information and power, the MCP threatens to expose Dillinger's theft of Flynn's creations. Dillinger uses the MCP to administer the company's computer network (in effect an AI Superuser); but it, empowered by Dillinger, begins to steal data from other systems, and comes to desire control of external corporations and even governments. The MCP is ultimately destroyed by Flynn and Tron. Before its destruction, the MCP ends most of its conversations with Dillinger with the computer programming phrase \\"End of line\\". In the sequel, Tron: Legacy, the digital world contains a nightclub called the \\"End of Line Club\\". Roy Kleinberg Roy Kleinberg is one of ENCOM's first computer programmers and coworker of Alan Bradley. He is played by Dan Shor. He makes only a brief cameo at the start of the first film, where he creates the Ram program that makes connections between ENCOM and an unnamed insurance company and begins working in a cubicle next to Alan's. When Alan went to Ed Dillinger about being blocked from the system, Kleinberg asks if he could have some of his popcorn which, Alan allows. He is credited in the film as \\"Popcorn Co- Worker\\". Kleinberg also appears in the short film \\"The Next Day,\\" which was included on the Blu-ray edition of Tron Legacy, and it's also in the film where his name is officially mentioned. He is the leader of the \\"Flynn Lives\\" movement, along with Alan Bradley. =Ram= Ram is an actuarial program created by Kleinberg, with his likeness, to \\"work for a big insurance company\\" before being captured by the MCP and forced to play on the Game Grid. While involved in the games, Ram exceeds his original programming to become a proficient gamer, and expresses a fair amount of confidence in his abilities while between contests; but took pride in his work as an actuarial program, which he seemed to associate with humanitarian purposes. He is injured by a game tank after escaping the game grid with Flynn and Tron, and he dies from these injuries in the company of Flynn. Crom Crom is a timid and pudgy compound interest program, created by full branch managing savings and loan bank programmer Mr. Henderson, who was captured by the MCP and forced to play on the Game Grid. He is played by Peter Jurasik. Crom and Flynn are forced to battle each other in the ring game. Flynn gains the upper hand, but refuses to kill a defenseless Crom, twice defying Sark's command to do so. Sark then derezzes the piece of the playing field that Crom is hanging from, which sends the hapless program falling to his death. Bit The Bit is a representation of a bit (binary digit), and as such is only capable of providing yes and no (1,0) answers to any question, through which it managed to convey various emotions. The Bit appeared twice in the movie, once at the beginning of the movie as companion to Clu and later as a companion to Flynn himself, and was originally to have a more extensive role; but has only two minutes for scheduling reasons. Despite this, the co-creators of Max Headroom, in their book Creative Computer Graphics, called it \\"one of the most memorable characters in the film.\\" At the time of the film's release, the character represented an innovative use of vector graphics and morphing. Physically, the Bit was represented within the movie by a blue polyhedral shape that alternated between the compound of dodecahedron and icosahedron and the small triambic icosahedron (the first stellation of the icosahedron). When the Bit says the answer \\"yes\\", it briefly changes into a yellow octahedron and when it says \\"no\\" it changes into a red 35th stellation of an icosahedron; these resemble prismatic forms or \\"3-D versions\\" of the Latin letters 'O' and 'X', respectively. Tron 2.0, Tron: Killer App, Tron: The Ghost in the Machine The video game Tron 2.0 was a direct sequel to Tron but is now non-canon with release of Tron: Legacy and its various related titles. The comic book Tron: The Ghost in the Machine further explores the Tron 2.0 characters and storyline. Jet Bradley Jet Bradley is the son of Alan Bradley and Lora Baines Bradley and the protagonist of the game Tron 2.0. Jet is digitized while searching for his missing father. Within the digital world, he is tasked with locating the Tron Legacy Code. Jet is also the basis for the experimental program that is the central character of Tron: The Ghost in the Machine. This version of Jet is a digital backup of the original User, copied and stored within the system. Due to the complexities involved in making a copy of a human being, the program version of Jet is corrupted and split into three separate aspects. Eventually, all aspects of the program are united and given the choice to ascend from the digital world into the real world. Mercury Mercury is a female humanoid computer program. She is voiced by Rebecca Romijn. She is known within the computer world as a champion lightcycle racer but also shows some combat skills during the course of the game. She returns in Tron: The Ghost in the Machine as one of the leaders the resistance against the red version of the program Jet, who is masquerading as the MCP. Ma3a Ma3a (short for Math Assistant 3 Audio) is a female computer program. She is voiced by Cindy Morgan. Unlike most other programs in the computer world, Ma3a is shaped like a sphere. When she was originally improved from Yori by Lora Baines in March 1988, she was known as Ma1a (short for Math Assistant 1 Audio), followed by Ma2a (short for Math Assistant 2 Audio) in June 1996 and Ma3a in 2003. Ma3a carries many of Lora's personality traits and even sounds like her (Cindy Morgan also played Yori in TRON). Some ENCOM employees have come to believe that part of Lora was digitized into Ma3a's code in the midst of the 1994 digitizing accident that resulted in Lora's death. In March 2003, Alan Bradley was given the \\"Digital Pal\\" award for Ma3a. Thorne J.D. Thorne was an executive from fCon who was improperly digitized into the computer and became corrupted, spreading like a virus throughout the system. Corrupted programs that follow Thorne as \\"The Master User\\" are called Z-Lots (pronounced \\"zealots\\"). Thorne is derezzed after a battle with the Kernel. Before he dies, he passes along vital information on fCon to Jet Bradley. The Kernel The Kernel is a security program commanding the system's ICPs. He was destroyed by Jet Bradley during a battle with the corrupted user Thorne. Byte The Byte is similar to the Bit in visual design and also speaks in a modulated voice. Unlike the Bit, the Byte is able to speak in full English sentences. Data Wraiths Data Wraiths are digitizable, elite hacker users that were employed by fCon to create havoc in computer systems around the world, steal top-secret data and destroying the databases of fCon's competitors. When they derez in the computer world they are kicked out of the computer and return to their original human form, unconscious. Seth Crown, Eva Popoff, and Esmond Baza Seth Crown, Eva Popoff, and Esmond Baza are three fCon executives who attempted to transfer themselves into the computer world unaware that the correction algorithms necessary for proper transfer had been disabled. Without the algorithms, the digitization process went awry and the three executives were merged into one horrible monstrosity. After being defeated and pushed out of the digitzing stream by Jet (both for his safety and theirs, as their corrupted state would have killed them in the real world), they are stored in a hard drive so Alan can fix their code. Tron: Legacy, Tron: Betrayal, Tron: Uprising and Tron: Evolution Tron: Legacy, its comic book tie-in Tron: Betrayal, the animated television prequel Tron: Uprising and the video game tie-in Tron: Evolution are all direct sequels to Tron. Several characters appear in all four pieces of the franchise while others are specific to one component. All four parts establish a specific time line of the Tron universe. Sam Flynn Samuel \\"Sam\\" Flynn is the son of Kevin Flynn who is a controlling shareholder at ENCOM and the protagonist of Tron: Legacy, played by Garrett Hedlund and voiced in the video games by Ross Thomas. After 20 years of his father's absence, Sam is lured onto the Grid, where he reunites with his father and catalyzes the action of the second film, culminating in the destruction of Clu 2. Deciding to take responsibility of ENCOM, he names Alan the Chairman of the Board and takes Quorra to see her first sunrise. Quorra Quorra is a skilled warrior and the last remaining member of a group of 'isomorphic algorithms' destroyed by Clu 2, played by Olivia Wilde and voiced in video games by Erin Cottrell. In the second film, she is a confidante to Kevin Flynn, who saved her from Clu 2's purge of the ISOs. Anxious to experience the outside world, Quorra accompanies Sam to escape the grid and enter the real world; both her name and her story-arc appear to relate to the Greek myth of Persephone.\\" Clu 2 Clu 2 (short for Clu 2.0) is an updated version of Clu created by Kevin Flynn to oversee the development of the Grid and the main antagonist of Tron: Legacy. He is physically played by John Reardon, with Jeff Bridges lending his likeness and voice to the character. Programmed with the command of creating a \\"perfect system\\", Clu 2 grew to resent Flynn ‚Äì particularly, his fondness for the \\"imperfect\\", spontaneously-generated Isos, or \\"isomorphic algorithms\\". Clu 2 later betrayed Flynn and Tron to seize total control of the Grid, and then enacted genocide upon the Isos, and forced Flynn into hiding for twenty years. Over this period, Clu 2 kept the Grid under his own control, reprogramming his opponents as soldiers for his own army, led by a reprogrammed Tron under the name 'Rinzler'. He continued to seek Flynn for his \\"identity disc\\", whose contents would allow Clu 2 to cross into the real world; and later lured Flynn's son Sam onto the Grid. After first trying to destroy him, Clu 2 uses Sam to draw out Flynn, and obtains his identity disc. He is destroyed after a long series of struggles, at whose end Flynn 'reintegrates' Clu 2 into himself, apparently destroying them both. ISOs The ISOs (short for Isomorphic algorithms) are a race of programs that spontaneously arose on the Grid. Clu 2 saw them as an obstacle to his creation of a perfect system whilst Kevin Flynn saw them as the next stage of evolution; wherefore Clu 2 betrayed Flynn and destroyed most of the ISOs. The last remaining ISO is Quorra, saved by Flynn and sent to the real world with Sam. Castor/Zuse Castor is a flamboyant supermodel program and the owner of the End of Line club located inside the tallest tower on the Grid, played by Michael Sheen. When originally named \\"Zuse\\", he was an ally of Flynn's and the ISOs' under his former name, but he betrays Sam and Quorra to bargain with Clu 2; he wishes to control the Grid once Clu 2 leaves for the real world. However, though Clu 2 seems to agree to the bargain, he traps Castor in his club, setting off explosions that kill him and his associate Gem. Zuse is most likely named after Konrad Zuse, whose Z3 was the first automatic programmable digital computer constructed, in 1941. Rinzler/Tron Rinzler is a security program who serves as Clu 2's right-hand man, played by Anis Cheurfa, a well-known martial-arts performer cast for his abilities, stunts and acrobatic talents, with Bruce Boxleitner lending his voice and likeness for the character. Considered a master warrior, he uses two identity discs in combat and displays advanced acrobatic talent. The two-disc DVD edition of the original Tron revealed that in the late 1970s, Lisberger Studios had produced an early demo animation showing the character 'Tron' similarly armed with two \\"exploding discs\\", (see Tron Origins). Later in Tron: Legacy, it is revealed that Rinzler is a re-purposed form of the version update of Tron known as Tron 2 (short for Tron 2.0). Though it appears in Legacy that Tron was defeated in the initial strike of Clu 2's coup, Tron: Uprising reveals that he initially escaped capture, at the cost of severe injury, and served as a mentor to the program Beck in inciting insurrection against Clu 2's new regime; it has yet to be shown at what point in the time between Uprising and Legacy that Tron was captured and repurposed. As Rinzler, he has several encounters with Sam Flynn throughout Legacy, culminating in an aerial pursuit, during which he remembers his past identity and turns against Clu 2, who sends Rinzler plummeting into the Sea of Simulation. Rinzler's ultimate fate is left unknown, but as he sinks into the Sea, his red markings (indicating alliance to/control by Clu 2) fade to his original blue colors. Rinzler is named after Lucasfilm Executive Editor, J.W. Rinzler, who has authored several books, including The Making of Star Wars, The Complete Making of Indiana Jones, and Making of The Empire Strikes Back. Director Joseph Kosinski chose the name during a working session with the writers when one of Rinzler's books happened to be on the table. Jarvis Jarvis is an administration program who serves as Clu 2's chief bureaucrat, played by James Frain. While probably efficient in his function, his personality is shown to be sycophantic and cowardly. Jarvis attempts at every turn to impress Clu 2 and win approval. After Jarvis fails to prevent Sam Flynn from taking back his father's disc, Clu 2 derezzes him. Bartok Bartok is a basic program, leader of a rebel faction in TRON City, played by Conrad Coates. In TRON: Uprising, he and his friend: Hopper joined a task force form by Paige to hunt down the renegade, after witnessing the workers standing up to Pavel, he and Hopper joined in also to defend the Renegade. In TRON Legacy, he is first seen speaking to Castor demanding an audience to Zuse, when the Black Guards attack the club, he started fighting them, but was quickly derezzed. Edward Dillinger Jr. Edward Dillinger Jr. is the son of Ed Dillinger and lead programmer on the ENCOM operating system, played by an uncredited Cillian Murphy. He is seen attending an ENCOM board meeting in the beginning of Legacy. Edward Dillinger Jr. has earned a reputation for making the ENCOM operating system more secure and harder to copy than previous versions. When Sam Flynn releases the software for free, Dillinger suggests that the company take credit and claim that it was a gift to their customers to defuse the situation. Anon Anon is the main protagonist of Tron: Evolution. He is a security program owned by Kevin Flynn to try to maintain order in the grid and to investigate conspiracies. He teamed with Quorra in trying to stop Clu 2 from taking over the grid but was derezzed saving her from falling debris. Abraxas Abraxas is the main antagonist of Tron: Evolution. He is voiced by John Glover. He was formerly an ISO named Jalen before he was re-purposed by Clu 2 as a computer virus to justify the purge of the other ISOs from the Grid. Beck Beck is young vehicle maintenance program and the main protagonist of Tron: Uprising. He is voiced by Elijah Wood. Through most of the series, he leads a revolution against Clu 2 and his armies from within the digital realm of The Grid. He is trained by Tron and looks to him as a mentor throughout his time as a games warrior. Beck eventually becomes as powerful as Tron and challenges the tyranny of Tesler and his oppressive forces. Tesler General Tesler is a command program who serves as one of Clu 2's generals and the main antagonist of Tron: Uprising. He is voiced by Lance Henriksen. He is in charge of the forces occupying Argon City; Paige and Pavel report directly to him. He believes Tron is dead until Beck (taking on the mantle of Tron.) arrives, he calls him the \\"Renegade\\". Whenever Beck arrives to help the people of Argon, Tesler tries to stop him by any means. In a flashback, he recruited Paige into joining him when he claimed the ISOs derezzed her friends, in reality he order her friends executed. Tesler has no problem derezzing his own men for either failing or reporting that the Renegade is Tron. Tesler has the ability to stressed out his arms and derezzed anyone or anything with his hands, he's shown to dislike Dyson and fearing failure to Clu should the Renegade free Argon and the Grid. Dyson Dyson is Clu's highest-ranking officer, sent to spearhead the apprehension of the Renegade and one of the recurring antagonist of Tron: Uprising. He is voiced by John Glover. He started out as a friend and member of Tron's security force. While trying to stop a riot between some programs and ISOs, Dyson got half his face derezzed, believing Flynn has betrayed the grid due to siding with ISOs, he later joined Clu and participated in his coup against Tron and Kevin Flynn. He also scarred Tron's face and have him brought to Clu, however he was led to believed he was dead, since the recognizer carrying him was sent shot down. He was then sent to Argon to deal with the Renegade, Tron sent Beck to captured him, but prove to be too clever. When Tron arrived to face him, Dyson believed he was the Renegade until Tron revealed himself to him, he was shock to see him alive, try to offer him to joined him, but Tron refused. Tron was fixing to derezzed him, but Tron decided to spared him for now, so he can delivered a message to Clu. This cause him to flee Argon and reported Tron's survival to Clu. When ask who else knows, he derezzes Clu's sentry and said: \\"Nobody, only us, Clu then advises to keep it that way. Minor characters * Gem is a character in Tron: Legacy, played by Beau Garrett.

He looked at the sky and saw the \\"shadow of a gigantic spaceship\\", and a voice whispered \\"Av√¥hai\\" in his ear. He was in that farm for a college work. \\"Av√¥hai\\" comes from the words \\"Av√¥\\" (grandfather) and \\"Pai\\" (father).

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History Worsley Old Hall The present building on the site dates from the 16th or early 17th century. It was originally a timber-framed building which has been rebuilt in brick. It is thought that it originally consisted of a hall range on the south side, with wings extending to the north on the east and west sides. The house was remodelled in the 18th century with the addition of a range immediately to the north of the hall range. It was substantially extended in or around 1855 when an extension was added to the east wing. Further work was carried out in 1891; in 1905 the space between the wings was filled in with a billiard room with a table supplied by Orme and Sons. In 1906 a small wing was added on the northwest side. During the 20th century there were further internal alterations, particularly in the 1990s when it was converted into a restaurant. The hall is of particular historical importance because it was here that Francis Egerton, the 3rd Duke of Bridgewater, James Brindley and John Gilbert planned the Bridgewater Canal and supervised its building. Architecture The building is in brick, most of which is rendered. The roofs are of stone and slate. Some of the 19th-century extensions are timber- framed. Present day As of 2011 the building was a public house and restaurant in the Brewers Fayre chain. In August 2013 the building was sold has and been refurbished and re-opened in December 2013 as a food-led real ale pub operated by Brunning and Price.

Development Based on the Speed Twin, the TR5 was a trials machine designed for off-road use with a high level two into one exhaust and good handling on public roads. The name 'Trophy' came from the three 'specials' that Triumph built for the Italian International Six Day Trial in 1948, which went on to win three gold medals and the manufacturers team trophy. Racing in American Motorcyclist Association (AMA) Class C until 1969, the American export models included components from the Tiger 100 to create a motorcycle for desert competition. The original TR5 Trophy models of 1949 used the aluminum cylinder barrels and heads from a generator motor Triumph had supplied for the War Department in WW2. This was Triumph's first aluminum cylinder head/barrel, and factory employees speculated during the War that the alloy heads, with their superior cooling properties, could easily be adapted for a motorcycle. The TR5 Trophy models from 1949-50 used modified versions of these cylinder heads, nicknamed the 'square barrel'. From 1951 the engine was updated with new alloy barrels and heads with finer-pitch finning and a rounded profile, which was shared with the Tiger 100 model. The TR5 was replaced with a new range of unit construction twins in 1959. Triumph TR5T Trophy Trail built for 1973 and 1974. Also known as the Adventurer. Trophy name The Trophy name was extended to the TR6 Trophy and resurrected for the Trophy 500 (T100C) in 1971, which in turn was replaced by the Trophy Trail (TR5T) in 1973. This model enjoyed competition success gaining the British team individual gold medals and 2nd place overall in the 1973 ISDT competition held in the critical USA market. The new Triumph Motorcycles company also used the Trophy name for the Trophy 900 and Trophy 1200 models.

It is found in Uruguay, Paraguay, Brazil, and Argentina. Taxonomy The species was first described in 1842 by Carl Ludwig Koch as Mygale anthracina. In 1850, he transferred it to his subgenus Eurypelma using the name (Mygale) Eurypelma anthracina, although Eurypelma was treated as a valid genus by later authors. (As the Greek word pelma is neuter, the correct form of the species name in this combination is anthracinum, as used by Carl Friedrich Roewer in 1942, for example.) Much later, Robert Raven (1985) synonymized Eurypelma with Avicularia (though this had previously been done by Thorell 1870 it had been ignored), implicitly transferring the species to this latter genus Avicularia. A re-examination of the holotype in 2011 suggested that it actually belonged to the genus Grammostola. Description Grammostola anthracina is characterized by having an entirely brown body; females have long spermathecae with a rounded apex. The total length of a female's body is about 45 mm; the fourth (last) leg is longest at about 60 mm. The forward-facing side of the coxa of the first leg has stridulatory hairs. Urticating hairs of types III and IV are present on the upper surface of the abdomen. The form of the spermathecae, stridulatory hairs and urticating hairs are characteristic of the genus Grammostola.

She taught piano on the faculty of the Curtis Institute of Music from 1936 until her death in 2020. Early life and education Born in Cleveland, Ohio, Sokoloff was the daughter of a barber. Her mother was an amateur singer and encouraged her daughter's musical interests. She began her studies with Ruth Edwards at the Cleveland Institute of Music at the age of eight. In 1931, she enrolled at the Curtis Institute of Music, where she studied piano with David Saperton and chamber music with Louis Bailly. Career Sokoloff later studied the duo-piano repertoire with Vera Brodsky and Harold Triggs and eventually formed a duo team with her husband, pianist Vladimir Sokoloff. Vladimir was also on the piano faculty at Curtis and from 1938 to 1950 was the pianist for the Philadelphia Orchestra. One of their daughters, Laurie, was the principal piccolist of the Baltimore Symphony for 47 years. Their other daughter, Kathy, became director of development at the Settlement Music School. Eleanor joined the Curtis faculty in 1936, at first as an instructor to non-piano majors, and in 1950 became a full-fledged member of the piano faculty.

The motive for the murders has been identified as jealousy, since Sch√ºrrer had dated the children's stepfather in 2006 while he was on holiday on the Greek island of Crete where she was working at a local hostel. Biography Early life Sch√ºrrer was born in Hanover, Germany. When she was 11 years old, her father left the family; Christine and her father had very little contact after that. She went to New York as an exchange student and lived with relatives in Manhattan. During her stay in the United States she also studied in Oklahoma. After she moved back to Germany, Sch√ºrrer settled in G√∂ttingen where she studied history for the next six years before traveling to Athens, Greece. While in Athens Sch√ºrrer got a job at a hostel and also worked as a historian. After one year she moved back to her hometown in Germany to work but soon returned to Greece, this time to the island of Crete, where she met and had a romantic relationship with a Swedish man, the stepfather of her future victims. Murders and arrest Aerial map of Arboga where the murders were committed Sch√ºrrer arrived in Sweden during the summer of 2007 and settled in S√∂dermalm, in central Stockholm. She later found an apartment in Skarpn√§ck, a suburb of Stockholm. During this period Sch√ºrrer tried to commit suicide for a third time. She was admitted to S√∂dersjukhuset hospital with only minor cuts on her arms and was later released. She had previously tried to commit suicide because she felt betrayed by a Swedish man leaving her after a two-week romance in Greece. Police believe that Sch√ºrrer arrived in Arboga by train on the afternoon of March 17, 2008. She went to the victim's house and knocked on the door. When the mother, 23-year-old Emma Jangestig, answered the door, Sch√ºrrer entered the house and struck her over the head 15 times with a hammer. She then attacked the woman's two children, 3-year old Max and 1-year old Saga, causing fatal trauma to their heads. Sch√ºrrer had visited Arboga twice before on March 12 and March 14, possibly to get more information as to the mother's location. The mother's ex-boyfriend, the father of the two children, was arrested, but he was released the next day after as it was established he was not the killer. Sch√ºrrer was arrested in Germany on March 22, 2008, but was released the same day. On March 24, German police sent DNA samples from the suspect to Swedish police for testing. The mother had begun to wake up from her coma in a hospital at about the same time, and could identify Sch√ºrrer as her attacker. Swedish investigators also examined video from a surveillance camera in the Arboga railway station and a witness had identified Sch√ºrrer, proving that she had been in Arboga on the day and time of the murder. She had left Sweden and headed back to Germany on March 18. She was arrested by German police on March 30, the day after an arrest warrant had been signed. She was later transferred to Sweden for the trial. Trial and sentence On August 26, 2008 Sch√ºrrer was found guilty of the murders and the assault on the mother. She underwent a psychological evaluation to determine if she was fit to be sentenced to prison or should instead receive psychiatric treatment. She refused to cooperate with officials so it was impossible to make an accurate assessment of her psychological health. On October 14, 2008 she was sentenced to life in prison after an evaluation showed that she suffered from no mental illness as defined in Swedish law. If and when Sch√ºrrer is released from prison she will be deported from Sweden and barred from entering the country for life. Sch√ºrrer's defense attorney, Per-Ingvar Ekblad, said that he would take the case to the court of appeals. The case received extensive coverage from both Swedish and world media. =Autopsy photos= In September 2008, the Swedish media reported that the public preliminary investigation protocols concerning Sch√ºrrer's murder trial had been made available through a torrent on The Pirate Bay, a Swedish website providing magnet links. In Sweden, preliminary investigations become publicly available the moment a lawsuit is filed and can be ordered from the court by any individual. The documents included pictures from the autopsy of the two murdered children, leading their father Nicklas Jangestig to demand that the website remove the material; The Pirate Bay refused. The number of downloads increased to about 50,000 a few days later. On 11 September 2008, the website's press contact Peter Sunde participated in the debate program Debatt on the public broadcaster SVT. Sunde had agreed to participate on the condition that the father Nicklas Jangestig would not take part in the debate. Jangestig ultimately did participate in the program by telephone, which Sunde viewed as a betrayal by SVT. This resulted in The Pirate Bay suspending all of its press contacts the following day. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs our job to judge if something is ethical or unethical or what other people want to put out on the internet,‚Äù said The Pirate Bay‚Äôs spokesperson Peter Sunde to TV4. Appeal Sch√ºrrer appealed to the Svea Court of Appeal for a new trial. Her sentence was finalised on February 16 when her appeal was rejected. Sch√ºrrer was transferred to a women's prison in Vechta, Germany in March, 2012 to serve out the remainder of her sentence. Sch√ºrrer is the seventh woman in Swedish history to be sentenced to life imprisonment.

Journal of Consumer Behaviour 4 (1): 64‚Äì72. This emotion, energy, excitement, or anticipation about a product or service can be positive or negative. Buzz can be generated by intentional marketing activities by the brand owner or it can be the result of an independent event that enters public awareness through social or traditional media such as newspapers. Marketing buzz originally referred to oral communication but in the age of Web 2.0, social media such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube are now the dominant communication channels for marketing buzz. Strategies Some of the common tactics used to create buzz include building suspense around a launch or event, creating a controversy, or reaching out to bloggers and social media influencers. Social media participants in any particular virtual community can be divided into three segments: influencers, individuals, and consumers. Influencers amplify both positive and negative messages to the target audience, often because of their reputation within the community. Therefore, a successful social media campaign must find and engage with influencers that are positively inclined to the brand, providing them with product information and incentives to forward it on to the community. Individuals are members of the community who find value in absorbing the content and interacting with other members. The purpose of the marketing strategy is ultimately to turn individuals into the third group, consumers, who actually purchase the product in the real world and then develop brand loyalty that forms the basis for ongoing positive marketing buzz. The challenge for the marketer is to understand the potentially complex dynamics of the virtual community and be able to use them effectively. Development of a social media marketing strategy must also take into account interaction with traditional media including the potential both for synergies, where the two combine to greater effect, and cannibalism, where one takes market from the other, leading to no real market expansion. This can be seen in the growing connection between marketing buzz and traditional television broadcasts.Jaime J. Weinman, \\"Who's watching? Who cares? Once obsessed with viewers and ratings, the television model these days is all about buzz,\\" Maclean's 126, no. 4 (February 2013):54 Shows monitor buzz, encouraging audience participation on social media during broadcasts, and in 2013 the Nielsen ratings were expanded to include social media rankings based on Twitter buzz. But the best known example is the Super Bowl advertising phenomenon. Companies build anticipation before the game using different tactics that include releasing the ads or teasers for them on-line, soliciting user input such as Doritos‚Äô Crash the Super Bowl competition where on-line voting between consumer created ads determines which will air during the game, and purposefully generating controversy, such as the 2013 and 2014 SodaStream ads that were rejected by the network airing the game for directly naming competitors. For advertising to generate effective positive buzz, research has shown that it must engage the viewer‚Äôs emotions in a positive way.Caleb J. Seifert, et al, \\"Winning the Super \\"Buzz\\" Bowl,\\" Journal of Advertising Research 49, no. 3 (September 2009):293-303 Budweiser‚Äôs Super Bowl advertising has been the most successful at generating buzz as measured by the USA Today Super Bowl Ad Meter survey over its 26-year history, a testament to its masterful use of heartwarming stories, cute baby animals, majestic horses, and core American values to stir the positive emotions of audiences across a wide range of demographics. Using controversy to generate marketing buzz can be risky because research shows that while mild controversy stimulates more buzz than completely neutral topics, as the topic becomes more uncomfortable the amount of buzz drops significantly. The most buzz will be generated in a ‚Äúsweet spot‚Äù where the topic is interesting enough to invite comment, but not controversial enough to keep people away.Jonah Berger and Zoey Chen,‚ÄúWhen Controversy Sparks Buzz--and When It Doesn't‚Äù, Harvard Business Review 92, no. 4 (April 2014):28 There is also substantial risk of generating negative buzz when using controversy, for example Coca-Cola‚Äôs 2014 It‚Äôs Beautiful ad that aired during the Super Bowl and generated substantial backlash. Measurement Two common terms used to describe buzz are volume, which quantifies the number of interchanges related to a product or topic in a given time period, and rating or level, a more qualitative measure of the positive or negative sentiment or amount of engagement associated with the product.Xueming Luo and Jie Zhang, \\"How Do Consumer Buzz and Traffic in Social Media Marketing Predict the Value of the Firm?,\\" Journal of Management Information Systems 30, no. 2 (Fall 2013):213-238 Basic social media measures of buzz volume include visits, views, mentions, followers and subscribers; next level measures such as shares, replies, clicks, re-tweets, comments and wall posts provide a better indication of the participants' engagement levels because they require action in response to an initial communication. It is possible for firms to track the marketing buzz of their products online using buzz monitoring. Many tools are available to gather buzz data; some search the web looking for particular mentions in blogs or posts, others monitor conversations on social media channels and score them on popularity, influence, and sentiment using algorithms that assess emotion and personal engagement. Buzz monitoring can be used to assess the performance of marketing strategies as well as quickly identify negative buzz or product issues that require a response. It can also be used to identify and capitalize on current trends that will shift consumer behaviors. For example the low-carb diet was buzzing months before sales at grocery stores reflected the trend. Monitoring buzz around certain topics can be used as an anonymous equivalent of a traditional focus group in new product development. For some companies it is important to understand the buzz surrounding a product before committing to the market.Mehta, Maneesh; Doorley, Thomas; Horvath, Michael (November / December 2005). \\"Future signals: How successful growing companies stay on course\\". Ivey Business Journal: 4. Retrieved 2009-06-08 Positive vs. negative buzz Positive \\"buzz\\" is often a goal of viral marketing, public relations, and advertising on Web 2.0 media.http://journalism.uoregon.edu/~tbivins/J496/readings/WOM/defs.pdf It occurs when high levels of individual engagement on social media drive the buzz volume up for positive associations with the product or brand. It gets to the point that capturing the attention of consumers and media easily, which catch people's attention because the information is perceived as entertaining, fascinating, or even newsworthy. Examples of products with strong positive marketing buzz upon introduction are Harry Potter, Volkswagen's New Beetle, Pok√©mon, Beanie Babies, and The Blair Witch Project.Ren√©e Dye, \\"The Buzz on Buzz\\" Harvard business Review, (2001-01-29) Negative buzz can result from events that generate bad associations with the product in the mind of the public, such as a product safety recall, or from unintended consequences of ill-advised marketing strategies. If not swiftly counteracted, negative buzz can be harmful to a product‚Äôs success and the most social network savvy organizations prepare for these eventualities. Examples of negative buzz include the United Colors of Benetton's shock advertising campaign that generated numerous boycotts and lawsuits, and the 2014 General Motors recall of cars many years after a known issue with a faulty ignition switch which they admitted had caused 13 deaths. In the latter case, traditional media also contributed to the amplification of the story through reporting on the ongoing recalls and GM CEO Mary Barra's testimony before the US House of Representatives. Effectiveness Buzz works as a marketing tool because individuals in social settings are easier to trust than organizations that may be perceived to have vested interests in promoting their products and/or services. Interpersonal communication has been shown to be more effective in influencing consumers‚Äô purchasing decisions than advertising alone and the two combined have the greatest power. A 2013 paper by Xueming Luo and Jie Zhang lists numerous previous studies that have shown a positive correlation between buzz rating and/or volume and product sales or company revenue. To expand further on that research, Luo and Zhang investigated the relationship of buzz and web traffic and their effect on stock market performance for nine top publicly traded firms in the computer hardware and software industries. Comparing data on consumer buzz rating and volume from a popular electronic product review Website with the firms‚Äô stock returns over the same period, they found a strong positive correlation between online buzz and stock performance. They also found that due to increasing online content and limitations in consumer attention, competing buzz for rival products could have a negative effect on a firm‚Äôs performance. For these nine companies, buzz had a greater effect than traffic and accounted for approximately 11% of the total variation of stock returns, with 6% due to the firms‚Äô own marketing driving the stock price up and 5% due to rival firms‚Äô buzz driving it down. As consumers increasingly expect to have access to buzz about products as part of their purchasing decisions and to interact with the brand in social media, successful companies are being driven to adopt social media marketing strategies to stay competitive. To successfully plan and implement these campaigns requires the ability to predict their effectiveness and therefore the return on investment that can be expected for the dollars expended.Guy Powell, Jerry Dimos, and Steven Groves, ROI of Social Media: How to Improve the Return on Your Social Marketing Investment, (Singapore : John Wiley & Sons [Asia], 2011), p. 7-8 Marketing buzz in the digital age With the addition of new interactive and digital media technologies into the marketing industry, a significant emphasis has been put on the use of online content to generate buzz about a product, service, or company.http://www.marketing.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=5513#.U-oAvF5H3lI Companies well known for this practice are Amazon and Netflix, both of which utilize individual customer patterns and usage trends on these sites to cater the customers' future experiences on the site around the individuals. As a result, this works towards one of the main goals of buzz marketing, to provide each customer with a unique experience that motivates them to purchase a product. Many companies are also using their online presence to generate buzz by allowing users to post reviews on their sites, as well as the use of reviews posted on third party sites. This concept of online reviewing also works to generate negative buzz, and has been a topic of criticism. Online review site Yelp has been subject to criticism after allegations that business owners were paying the site to only publish the positive reviews, in an attempt to boost sales and hide negative buzz about these businesses. After 10 small businesses filed a lawsuit against Yelp in 2010, the site made the decision to remove the \\"Favourite Review\\" option, that previously allowed a business owner to choose the review they liked the most and have it showcased, as well as made content previously hidden from potential customers, visible. Additionally, the social media site Twitter has been a game changer in terms of marketing buzz in the digital age. The online microblogging site, with web traffic totalling about 350,000 tweets being sent per minute, has quickly become an important tool in business and in marketing. Companies are now creating Twitter pages as a means of personal communication with their target audience. Twitter allows businesses of any size to speak directly to their intended demographic, and allows the customer to communicate back, a feature unique to marketing technologies and methods utilized in the digital age. In addition, companies can pay to have their tweets show up on the Twitter \\"timeline\\" of users they want to reach. Many celebrities and public figures carrying a large amount of Twitter \\"followers\\" also accept payment to tweet about products. Some notable examples of buzz marketing in the digital age include the highly successful marketing campaign for the third season of the AMC series Mad Men. The TV channel created an online avatar maker that allowed fans of the show to create an online version of themselves in the 1960s style portrayed on the show. The site experienced over half a million users in the first week and has since been updated to promote consecutive seasons. The campaign gave the show some of its highest ratings seen up to that point. Another successful viral buzz marketing campaign surrounded the 2007 \\"found footage\\" motion picture Paranormal Activity. The small budget film was originally released to only select cities. A trailer was then released to the public with the ending calling individuals to go online and \\"demand\\" the movie be brought to a city near them. Once a city was demanded enough times, the film would be screened in theatres in that city. The success of this movie can be credited to this marketing campaign, which worked on the principle of \\"we always want what we don't have\\".

It is the second of six Mr. Moto novels and can also be found in the omnibus Mr. Moto's Three Aces published in 1939. The Moto novels are spy fiction and adventure novels set in the Orient, which in the 1930s was still considered mysterious and exotic. Mr. Moto is an Imperial spy for the Japanese government and often has to deal with people who accidentally get involved in his work. Plot summary An expatriate American, Tom Nelson, has been living in Beiping (modern day Beijing) for some time and believes that he understands the Oriental mind. When he meets Eleanor Joyce he thinks that she is getting involved in matters way over her head when she agrees to meet with Major Jamison Best, a British ex-Army officer who sells stolen Chinese artifacts and art treasures. After dinner with Best, Nelson tries to make sense of Best‚Äôs cryptic conversation concerning a Chinese bandit chief named Wu Lo Feng and the possibility of trouble brewing in the city. On leaving dinner, he runs into Joyce whom he tries to persuade to not get involved in any scheme Best has going. She doesn‚Äôt listen to him but later he finds her wandering around outside of Best‚Äôs house, distraught. The next day Major Best is found dead, killed by a bolt from a Chinese crossbow. Mr. Moto is investigating the murder and he tells Nelson not to get involved. Nelson doesn‚Äôt listen to him and goes to warn Joyce since she was the last to see Best alive. Nelson soon discovers that Moto has made Best‚Äôs murder seem like a suicide. When he returns home someone tries to kill Nelson with a Chinese crossbow. Moto arrives and Nelson thinks he is the murderer. Cool and calm despite having a gun pointed at him, Moto once again warns Nelson not to interfere and offers him a chance to escape Peking on the next steamer. When Moto leaves, Nelson discovers that Wu Lo Feng is there ready to kill him. After escaping, Nelson goes to Joyce‚Äôs hotel to convince her to leave. She refuses and Nelson sees that she has an ancient Chinese scroll that Best mentioned and that a curio dealer, Pu had offered to him. Nelson and Joyce take the scroll to Prince Tung, a friend of Nelson‚Äôs. Nelson discovers that Joyce is a museum buyer sent to Peking to buy a set of eight ancient scrolls. Tung is shocked to discover that someone has promised all eight scrolls to Joyce since seven of them are in his private vault. The situation becomes dire when Wu‚Äôs men arrive and kidnap Nelson, Joyce and Tung. Soon after they arrive at their prison, an abandoned temple, Mr. Moto is brought in as yet another prisoner. Moto explains the situation to them. A rival military faction in Japan believes that their country is not advancing fast enough. These militant Japanese led by Mr. Takahara have hired Wu Lo Feng to cause a military disturbance in the city. Major Best was to raise money for the campaign by selling the eight scrolls that were stolen from Prince Tung. Best double-crossed Wu by selling information to Mr. Moto, and so was killed. Wu Lo Feng arrives with Takahara to finalize their plans for the uprising. Nelson, Tung and Moto are certain to be killed but are philosophical about their plight. However, Joyce makes an unexpected move and grabs Wu‚Äôs gun. They all escape after tying up Takahara and Wu. Moto organizes the police to stop the uprising and they all retire to Nelson‚Äôs home. Tung admonishes Nelson for not killing Wu since he is sure to retaliate. When Moto arrives he admits that he liquidated both Takahara and Wu to guarantee everyone‚Äôs safety. They all profusely thank Mr. Moto.

Themes Marquand‚Äôs Moto books are all generally about a clash of cultures between Asia and the West. In this novel, however, Nelson represents both the American and the Chinese way of thinking. Written in the first person from his point of view, Nelson admires the Chinese but is constantly reminded that he will never be part of their culture. Sometimes Nelson is praised by this Chinese friend Prince Tung for displaying the proper Chinese way of acting, and sometimes he is chastised for being too illogical, too Western. However, it was Eleanor Joyce‚Äôs highly illogical action of grabbing the bandit‚Äôs gun that ultimately saves their lives. Nelson and Joyce's budding romance and the Chinese scrolls are just minor complications set against the larger backdrop of Sino-Japanese relations. Moto as a conservative member of the Japanese Government is there to see that Japan advances at a slow and reasonable rate. Takahara represents the more militant Japanese who do not mind leaving chaos in their wake. But, the ever-polite Moto wants to maintain a balance between the old and the new. In one scene Prince Tung, representing China‚Äôs past and Mr. Moto, representing its future, politely share a cup of tea. Nelson, the Western outsider, watches from a distance but doesn't participate. Americans at the time may have been uncertain about the Japanese expansion into China but Marquand gives Moto the opportunity to defend the actions of his country: > A disturbance happens, anywhere in China, and my nation is always blamed for > it. It is hard; very, very hard. Did not your own great country seize a > large part of Mexico in the past century, Mr. Nelson? And what of Britain's > colonizing efforts? The British Empire has always held out a helping hand to > distressed and backward nations. Yet if my own poor country tries in the > most altruistic way to settle even the smallest Chinese difficulty, there > are notes of protest and inflammatory passages in the press. Ultimately, however, Mr. Moto is a decent man who goes out of his way to make sure the Americans remain safe. The historian Michael Schneider observed that Mr. Moto novels show Japanese expansionism in a light that might appeal to many Americans and Mr. Moto as a ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù in the spectrum of Japanese politics. Chinese culture is shown as ancient and exotic, but Schneider concludes that it is \\"difficult to see the novels as doing anything more than buttressing prevailing racial and ethnic stereotypes.\\" Reception The novel was praised for its \\"vitality and vividness\\"Plotters in Peking: THANK YOU, MR.

He fought in the War of 1812 and was in charge of the building of the ships at Erie, Pennsylvania that Oliver Hazard Perry commanded in the Battle of Lake Erie. Early life He was born on January 5, 1776 (date from Dobbins' headstone, Erie Cemetery) in Mifflin County, Pennsylvania, near Lewistown. He traveled to Erie in 1795 with Judah Colt and a group of surveyors with the Pennsylvania Population Company. Colt's interest in expanding into lake transportation is what causes Dobbins to eventually become a merchant mariner. In 1809, Dobbins, with Rufus S. Reed, purchases the schooner Catherine, which he renamed the Salina. Dobbins was known as being a man of \\"remarkable temperament\\" who was a known prankster. A biographer described one of his pranks: \\"On one occasion, while anchored by a group of islands near the west end of Lake Erie, Barney decided to explore one of the islands and left in a small boat with his gun and dog. He promised he would be back shortly. Dobbins got tired of waiting, and hoping to frighten his friend a bit, pulled anchor and sailed around the island out of sight of the unsuspecting Barney. He naturally planned to return after his friend had several moments of panic, but a sudden storm arose and forced Dobbins away from the island. Assured that his friend was in no danger, he returned to the port of Erie. Poor Barney remained on the island for three days until the weather cleared and he was rescued.\\" War of 1812 While in port at Mackinac Island, Dobbins, along with Rufus S. Reed and William W. Reed were captured when the British raided Fort Michilimackinac on July 17, 1812. They were paroled after they took an oath that they would not \\"take up arms against the United Kingdom,\\" which Dobbins refused to take. The British ordered that he, along with the other prisoners of war, sail to Fort Malden. Instead, Dobbins met up with General William Hull at Fort Detroit, where Dobbins was again taken prisoner when General Hull surrendered Detroit to the British on August 16, 1812. When it was realized that Dobbins had broken his promise by \\"taking up arms in the defense of Detroit\\" and was in danger of being executed, British Colonel Robert Nichols, a friend of Dobbins before the war, granted him safe passage to Cleveland, Ohio. After arriving back in Erie, Dobbins traveled to Washington, D.C. and briefed the United States Secretary of the Navy Paul Hamilton on the surrenders of Fort Michilimackinac and Detroit and the strength of the British navy on Lake Erie. When asked where the best place to build ships, Dobbin \\"unhesitatingly\\" said Presque Isle because \\"no finer oak grew than was to be found there, close to the water's edge, and in the land-locked harbor the vessels, when built, could ride in security.\\" Before Dobbins left Washington, D.C., he was given the dimensions of a small gunboat and was made a sailing master in the Navy. After arriving back in Erie, Dobbins set about building a fleet as directed by Secretary Hamilton. In 1813, upon completion of the fleet, Dobbins was given command of the , a former merchant vessel. On August 17, the fleet departed Erie and headed to Sandusky, Ohio to wait for the British fleet. On August 22, Dobbins was sent with the USS Ohio back to Erie to resupply with fresh provisions. In early September, he was again sent back to Erie for resupply. Dobbins returned to Sandusky on September 13, 1813, three days after the battle. For the rest of the war, Dobbins and the USS Ohio transported supplies to Detroit for the use during the ground offensives of the war. Revenue Cutter Service In 1816, Dobbins navigated the waters of Green Bay, with Colonel John Miller, to establish a fort at the head of the bay. He resigned his naval commission in 1826. Dobbins lobbied hard for the establishment of a United States Revenue Cutter Service, forerunner to the United States Coast Guard, station at Erie. He was appointed commander of the USRC Benjamin Rush in 1829 by United States President Andrew Jackson after its former commander, Gilbert Knapp, publicly called Jackson \\"a cutthroat and a murderer.\\" In 1834, Dobbins was given command of the USRC Erie. Dobbins, being a Jackson Democrat, was removed from command and Knapp reinstated when William Henry Harrison, a Whig, was elected in 1841. Dobbins was reinstated in 1845 by President James K. Polk and was put in command of the USRC Taney in Norfolk, Virginia from 1845 to 1846. Dobbins, who was not pleased with his new command away from Lake Erie, took a leave of absence and was eventually assigned back to the USRC Erie in 1847. He was removed from command and Knapp reinstated again with the election of Zachary Taylor in 1848. The Coast Guard maintains a station at Erie to this day. Dobbins died in Erie on February 29, 1856 and was buried in the Erie Cemetery. His papers are in the collection of the Buffalo History Museum.

Early life  Kumaraguruparar was born to Shanmukha Sikhamani Kavirayar and Sivakama-Sundari Ammaiyar in Srivaikuntam, Thoothukudi district. Until age five, he was dumb. When they visited Tiruchendur temple, he was blessed with speech. He sang Kandar Kalivenba in praise on Murugan. A few years later, he wrote Pillaitamizh in praise of Madurai Meenakshi temple. Soon afterward, he enrolled at the mutt at Dharmapuram where he began to study Sivava Siddhanta. kumaraguruparar (‡Æï‡ØÅ‡ÆÆ‡Æ∞‡Æï‡ØÅ‡Æ∞‡ØÅ‡Æ™‡Æ∞‡Æ∞‡Øç) Childhood Kumaraguruparar was born in Srivaikuntam in Tirunelveli District in Tamil Nadu. His parents - Shanmuka Sikamanikkavirayar, Shivakama Sundhari Ammaiyar - did not have a child for long. They worshipped their beloved deity Lord Muruga of Tiruchchendur. By the grace of Lord Muruga, they gave birth to a boy and named him, Kumaraguruparar. Though they got the son, as a result of their devotion and prayers, the child did not speak until five years. The worried parents again took their pleading to the presence of the Lord of Tiruchchendur. Astonishingly, the child began to not just speak but started the speech by singing a composition at that young five years of age on Lord Muruga, called Kandhar Kalivenpaa. The austerities of all the previous births made him into a prodigy! Early Wanderings At a very young age Kumaraguruparar left his house in search of a guru who could kindle his spirit in the pursuit of God. In Tiruchendhur he heard a divine voice that his guru would be the one in whose presence he would be unable to speak well. In search of a guru, Kumaraguruparar came to Madurai, where the renowned Tirumalai Nayakkar was ruling. Tirumalai Nayakkar honored Kumaraguruparar in Madurai. He composed Minakshi Amman Pillaiththamizh and sang the childhood of Goddess Minakshi one stage a day. One day when he sang Varukaipparuvam Goddess Minakshi Herself came as a young girl and bestowed Her grace by presenting a pearl garland to him. Kumaraguruparar sang Madhuraik Kalambakam, Minakshi Ammai Kuram hailing the God and Goddess at Madurai. On the request of Nayakkar, he also composed a song-a book of ethics by the name Neethi Neri Vilakkam. He was venerated and treated with a lot of respect at Madurai. He went next to Tiruvarur, where he sang Tiruvarur Nanmanimalai rejoicing the grace of Lord Thyagarajar of that abode. Meeting the guru From Tiruvarur Kumaraguruparar moved to Dharumapuram, reaching where his mind was signaling about a great thing that was going to happen soon. This town hosts the renowned mutt of the Saiva Siddhantha tradition called Thirukkayilaya Paramparai Dharumapura Adhinam. The saint who was decorating the Presidency of the mutt was Masilamani Desikar. Arriving at the mutt, Kumaraguruparar paid his obeisance to the saint. Desikar asked Kumaraguruparar to explain the significance of the song from Periya Puranam - ain^thu pEraRivum kaNkaLE Kolla. This is the song that describes the state of Sundaramurthy Nayanar, as he saw the dance of Lord Shiva at Thillai. Who can tell the state of that great saint Sundarar as he saw to his ecstasy the Blissful dance of his beloved Lord! Sekkizhar has so beautifully described the union Sundarar achieved with God at that sight. Unless by utter stupidity one tries to talk about that glory beyond any words, how can it be explained at all ?! Kumaraguruparar stood stunned. His words stammered. He realized that he was in front of the guru whom he has been searching for so long. He fell at the feet of Desikar and pleaded with him to initiate him into a life of renunciation. Desikar was not just a spiritually oriented person. He also had a concern for society. When spiritually getting elevated, shouldn't one become full of love for all the lives around? Desikar had realized the state in which Hinduism was getting crushed under the Mughal Empire with its barbaric intolerance towards Hinduism. He realized the need for the spiritually high, well-skilled, and devoted caliber like Kumaraguruparar to strengthen the Shaivite wisdom in the troubled lands. So he agreed to be the guru of Kumaraguruparar on the condition that he goes on pilgrimage to Kasi(Varanasi) and returns, subsequently, he would initiate Kumaraguruparar into sannyasa. Initiation of Kumaraguruparar Kmaraguruparar pleaded to Desikar that it would take a long time for him to complete the pilgrimage to Kasi (given the lack of facilities at that point in time). So Desikar waved off Kasi for the time being and asked him instead to stay at Thillai for a period of one Mandalam (45 days). Happily Kumaraguruparar agreed to that and proceeded to Thillaich Chirambalam(present Chidambaram Nataraja Temple). On the way, divinity called him to Vaiththeeshvaran koyil (Pullirukku Velur). There he sang Muththukkumaraswami Pillaith Thamizh. Kumaraguruparar enjoyed the stay at Thillai worshipping the Dancing Lord. He composed on the God and Goddess Chidhambara Mummanik Kovai, Chidhambarach Cheyyut Kovai, Sivakami Ammai Irattai Manimalai. On his return, Desikar initiated him to the renounced life with saffron robes. Having given the initiation, Desikar stressed to him the importance of revitalizing Saivism in the northern part of the country where it was suffering from the oppression by the Muslim rulers. Now Kumaraguruparar agreed to go to Kasi. The saint on a lion It was about the year 1658 CE. Dara Shukoh(eldest son of Shah Jahan, who was killed by Aurangazeb) was the ruler of the Varanasi province of the Mughul Empire. Aurangazeb the most intolerant of the Moghul lineage was ruling at Inpdraprastham(Delhi). Dara was an exceptional one in the Mughals. He was tolerant enough to seek what the other religions had to say and encouraged discussions among the religions. He dealt with the scholars of the Hindu religion. He is said to have translated some of the Upanishads into the Persian language. For a long time before, successive Muslim invaders ruined the holy city of Kasi and demolished the abode of Lord Vishwanath. At this point, there was a critical urge to keep alive the spirituality of the suppressed Hindus. On reaching Kasi, Kumaraguruparar sung Sakala Kalavalli Malai in praise of Goddess Saraswathi, praying to her to bestow the skill of words. The blessings of Vani came as a boon when he had to convince the opponents about the glory of Shaivism. He got to know the Hindustani language by Vani's grace. Kumaraguruparar wanted to meet with the Badusha, to establish a mutt in Kasi. Though Dara was fair with other religions, Kumaraguruparar had to cross many obstacles before he met Dara. The blessed saint, who had the valiance of spirituality, rode on a lion and went majestically into the court of Dara which frightened all the obstacle creators. Dara realized the spiritual power of saint kumaraguruparar. He treated the saint with respect. Dara organized an inter-religious conference. He requested saint Kumaraguruparar to address the same. Kumaraguruparar accepted the invitation and he spoke fluently in Hindustani language explaining the greatness of the philosophy of Saiva Siddhanta. The audience was thrilled to know the glory of Shaivism. Dara bowed before the saint. Establishing Kasi Mutt and Services Dara asked him what he could do for him. What materials would the saint want, for whom only God matters? He asked the king to provide him with the land in Kasi where he would build a mutt and serve Saivism. The saint was given the option to choose a place of his choice for Dara. The saint wanted to renovate the Kedhar Eashwaraswamy Temple at the Kedharghat. The saint said that a kite(Garudan)would fly in the sky and the area it circles is the area that would be required to build the mutt. As prophesied a kite appeared in the sky and marked the area that included the Kedhar Eashwaraswamy Temple and the land nearby for building a mutt. Dara gladly gave that land for that purpose. Kumaraguruparar renovated the abode of Kedhar Eashwara which was earlier ruined by the religious intolerants. In the Kumaraswamy Mutt that he built, he guided the people in the glory of Shaivite philosophy. His inspiring teachings the paved way for the restoration of the highly adored Lord Vishwanath and Lord Panduranga temples subsequently. The devotees offered lots of valuables to the saint. He took them to his guru at Dharumapuram. But Designer refused to accept them and directed him to spend those for the spiritual development of the people of Kasi. As per that Kumaraguruparar spent the materials in spreading the message of Shaivism. He visited Dharumapuram four times to pay respect to his guru. It is said that Kumaraguruparar also gave discourses on Kamba Ramayanam and among those who got inspired by that was the famous Hindi poet Tulasidas, who wrote Ramcharitamanas. Kumaraguruparar stayed in Kasi for thirty years from 1658 to 1688 spreading the glory of Shaivism giving the vital support to Hinduism during those troubled times. He attained Samadhi at Kasi on the third day after full moon day in May 1688. His vital services for the sustenance of the Hinduism will be remembered along with his beautiful compositions by future generations. Adoption of an ascetic lifestyle Upon entering the Dharmapuram mutt, he made a detailed study of the system of Saiva Siddhanta and worked on improving his knowledge of Tamil. Convinced of his deep learning and sincerity towards leading an ascetic lifestyle, the heads of the mutt conferred upon him the title of \\"Tambiran\\". He went to Kasi as insisted by his guru. There he spread the message of Saivism. He renovated the Kedareswar temple. He established a mutt in Kasi and until death he was present in Kasi. On 27-June-2010, a commemorative postage stamp on him was released by the Indian Postal department.

Developed with private funds and operated by the Norddeutscher Lloyd Line, she was one of the first of seven U-151-class U-boats built and one of only two used as unarmed cargo submarines. Construction Bremen was built together with her sister ship in 1916 by Deutsche Ozean-Reederei, a private shipping company created for the purpose, a subsidiary company of the North German Lloyd shipping company (now Hapag-Lloyd) and Deutsche Bank. She was constructed without armaments, with a wide beam to provide space for cargo. The cargo capacity was 700 tons (much of it outside the pressure hull), relatively small compared to surface ships. Bremen was one of seven submarines designed to carry cargo between the United States and Germany in 1916, through the naval blockade of the Entente Powers. Mainly enforced by Great Britain's Royal Navy, the blockade had led to great difficulties for German companies in acquiring raw materials which could not be found in quantity within the German sphere of influence, and thus substantially hindered the German war effort. Five of the submarine freighters were converted into long-range cruiser U-boats (U-kreuzers) equipped with two deck guns, and only two were completed according to the original design: Deutschland and Bremen. Maiden voyage and disappearance Bremen departed Bremerhaven in September 1916 for Norfolk, Virginia, commanded by Kapit√§nleutnant Karl Schwartzkopf, and reportedly carrying financial credits for Simon Lake to begin building cargo submarines for Germany. She did not complete this voyage and her fate is a mystery. Several views have been put forth as to the nature of her fate. German U-boat U-53 had been assigned to join Bremen as protection against British attacks but failed to make contact. Its commander Hans Rose reported having heard a radio broadcast on 28 September 1916 stating that Bremen had been sunk. A life preserver marked \\"Bremen\\" was found in Maiden Cove at Cape Elizabeth, Maine, on September 29, 1916. The submarine had been expected to arrive on the Atlantic Seaboard for at least a week. Stamped on the canvas covering was Shutz-Marke, a small crown, and \\"V-Epping-Hoven, Willhelms-haven.\\" Although in new condition and not long in the water, the life preserver was stained with oil. One source records that a submarine believed to have been Bremen was sighted south of Iceland on a course for Baltimore and units of 10th Cruiser Squadron were dispatched to intercept it; reported ramming a heavy, submerged object. However, the official log of HMS Mantua makes no mention of this, so it appears to be a myth. Another source states that Bremen was sunk by British submarine . In March 1917, G13 was on patrol off Shetland, covering the exit by U-boats from the North Sea. There she sighted a submarine identified as Bremen, and fired two torpedoes, which both missed. Turning, G13 fired again, first with her starboard beam, and continuing her turn with her port beam torpedoes; both these also missed. Then a final shot, with her stern tube, at a range of , was rewarded with an explosion, and Bremen was believed sunk. The Admiralty, however, felt this was inconclusive, and withheld credit for the hit. also records the view that Bremen survived this hit to return to port, where she was written off, and converted into a surface vessel. Yet another source regards her as lost, probably as a result of hitting a mine. In the absence of any firm evidence, the cause of Bremen's loss remains a mystery.

The Talmud additionally refers to this degree of heat as that which would scald a baby's abdomen.(B.Shabbat 40b). The temperature that constitutes yad soledet bo is under dispute. While Rabbi Moshe Feinstein ruled that a temperature of 110 ¬∞F (43 ¬∞C) must be considered yad soledet bo as a matter of practice, he noted that definitive yad soledet bo might be as high as 160 ¬∞F (71 ¬∞C).Igrot Moshe Orach Chaim 4:74 bishul 103 In practice, the more stringent of the two should be applied. In following with the principle of sfeika d'oraita l'chumra, a doubt in a case of biblical law must be ruled upon stringently. If there is a question as to whether or not a violation of Sabbath would be transgressed by heating liquids to 120 ¬∞F, the response would be in the affirmative, because this temperature exceeds 110 ¬∞F; this would be an example of ruling stringently based on the lower temperature. As explained in greater detail further on, liquids that have already been fully cooked are no longer subject to the same restrictions as raw liquids in terms of bishul if they remain warm, and in cases of biblical laws of bishul, pre-cooked liquids should have reached a temperature of 160 ¬∞F to be properly considered as pre-cooked; this would be an example of ruling stringently based on the higher temperature. A common practice when producing kosher wine is to render it yayin mevushal (◊ô◊ô◊ü ◊û◊ë◊ï◊©◊ú, \\"cooked wine\\"); this is done in order to permit it to be handled by a non-Shabbat observer, whether Jew or gentile.Rabbi Shlomo Ganzfried Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 47:3 While this cooking process used to be accomplished by bringing the wine or grape juice to a boil, recent technological advances have allowed for flash pasteurization to substitute for this procedure. According to one kosher wine maker, all of its mevushal wine is flash pasteurized to at least 185 ¬∞F,Abarbanel Wine Company: What Kosher Wine Is, and Isn't well above the stringent 160 ¬∞F of Rabbi Feinstein. However, there are more stringent authorities than Rabbi Feinstein in this matter, with some requiring 190 ¬∞F. It is debated whether this is a subjective temperature for which different individuals may determine their own personal yad soledet bo. Rabbi Joshua Falk doubts that yad soledet bo can be anything but that which would objectively scald an infant's abdomen because the temperature at which people will instinctively withdraw their hand from a heat source is not universal. Other authorities, including the Rosh, have no qualms about equating the two temperatures. Rabbi Yaakov Chaim SoferKaf Hachayim 318:143 quotes Rabbi Yosef Chaim's work Ben Ish ChaiParshat Bo 5 as stating that one can know if something is not yad soledet bo if one can put it in one's mouth without exceeding the normal limitations of the food being too hot for one to eat or drink.

It opened on St Patrick's Day 1930. History There has been a St Patrick's Church in Grangetown since 1882, adjacent to St Patrick's School. A Memorial Hall was built in 1921. Plans were set in motion in 1928 to build a new church, on the site of allotments of two parishioners. The foundation stone was laid on St Patrick's Day 1929 and the church was opened exactly one year later.  Activities  * Parish coach trips to places around Britain take place throughout the year. * The parish make an annual pilgrimage to Lourdes. * Parish Council meetings take place every quarter. Church groups and ministries * Society of Saint Vincent de Paul meet every other week on Friday at 18:30hrs in the presbytery. * Guild of St. Stephen (Altar Servers) * Ministers of the Word * Extraordinary Ministers of Holy Communion * Children's Liturgy * Parish Council * Parish Advisory Council * Union of Catholic Mothers * Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults * Offertory group * Choir * Cathechism  Recent events  It has been proposed that the current parish hall in Bishop Street be demolished to make way for a new health centre to serve the whole of Grangetown. It has arisen, however, that this cannot take place due to a group of bats (a protected species in Britain) that live in the roof of the hall. Designs have been made for a new hall to be built next to the church, meaning a removal of the lawn. Due to the reorganisation of the archdiocese, St. Cuthbert's Parish in the Docks will become part of St. Patrick's. Also, the church became part of the Cardiff Deanery instead of the Cardiff West Deanery. (The new deanery merged both the old Cardiff East and West deaneries.) Long serving priest, Father John Fahey, died on Christmas Eve in 2008. He was succeeded by Father Bogdan Wera in 2008 - who revived the church with a growing Polish community. Father Bogdan died in September 2017. The church has now been joined by Canon Michael Patrick Evans.  School  St Patrick's R C Primary School in Lucknow Street, Grangetown has close links with the church. A school mass is celebrated once a month in the church and sometimes in school during term times. The school has around 250 pupils aged 4‚Äì11 (Reception ‚Äì Year 6) and around 15 teachers, as well as non-teaching staff including teachers aids and admin.

During the last half of the nineteenth century his work in the cause of Catholic literature and Catholic church music contributed much to the rapid advancement of the Church in Great Britain and to the many conversions that were made throughout that period. Life Burns was born near Montrose, Angus. His father was a Presbyterian minister and sent him to a college in Glasgow with the idea that he should follow the same calling. But feeling no inclination for it, he left the school in 1832 and went to London where he found employment with a publishing firm. He acquired a knowledge of the trade and then set up for himself in a modest way. He soon won success and Anglican ministers adopted him, in their literary campaign of tracts and polemic publications. He then became a \\"Puseyite\\", or High Church man. From his press were issued books of a high literary tone in the series he called The Englishman's Library and The Fireside Library. The Oxford Movement under John Henry Newman drew him within its range, and he became a Catholic convert in 1847. The Anglican publications of the old house were sold off. Burns succeeded, in a comparatively brief time, in building up a reputation as publisher of Catholic literature. To his \\"Popular Library\\" Cardinal Wiseman contributed Fabiola and Cardinal Newman, Callista. Other volumes from well- known writers, prayer books, and books of devotion made the name of the firm of Burns & Oates a household name. Burns himself also wrote constantly on church music, and edited and republished many compositions. He died from cancer in London. Family His widow, who was also a convert, survived him twenty-two years, dying a member of the Ursuline community at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, U.S.A., January, 1893. Of his five daughters, four entered the Ursuline Order and the other became a Sister of Charity. His only son was ordained a priest, serving for a long time as chaplain at Nazareth House, Hammersmith, London.

The flag depicts nine alternating horizontal bands of yellow and red emblazoned with the coat of arms of the Universitat General offset towards the hoist in the centre.  History  On 8 August 1983 the regional council of Menorca established a commission to research symbols related to the island for usage on a flag. The commission concluded that there had never been an official flag of Menorca but that that island heavily relied on symbols of the Kingdom of Aragon for identification. The earliest use of the Aragonese flag, the Senyera, was dated back to 1232. The colours were officially adopted by the island following the defeat of the Moors by Alfonso III in 1287. The Coat of Arms was chosen to reference the Universitat General, the municipal administrative body of Minorca between the 15th and 19th centuries. The coat of arms depicts a tower topped by a staff surmounted by a cross potent and a vane pointing to the right. The tower surmounts a building and is surrounded by a pentagonal wall with a gate in the front and four angle towers leaning towards the central tower. On the left and right are placed to crowned shields of Crown of Aragon; the whole design is inscribed in an octagon with curvilinear sides. The council decided that both emblems were sufficient enough and they were combined to create the flag om 14 November 1983.

Color plate of a wound patient from the MSHWR. The Medical and Surgical History of the War of the Rebellion, 1861‚Äì65 (the MSHWR) was a United States Government Printing Office publication consisting of six volumes, issued between 1870 and 1888 and \\"prepared Under the Direction of Surgeon General United States Army, Joseph K. Barnes\\". The History was divided into three parts, each consisting of a medical history volume and a surgical history volume. The works detail tens of thousands of surgical cases and diseases occurring during the American Civil War (1861‚Äì1865). Contents The MSHWR included numerous statistical summaries relating to diseases, wounds, and deaths in both the Union and Confederate armies, almost all of the material formed from the reports of U.S. Army medical directors, surgeons, doctors, and hospital staff. The accounts are a basic source for medical data on the War and also comprise an important source of information relating to individual soldiers. The names of the surgeons who submitted these case studies are almost always included, so the books can be helpful in tracking where an individual surgeon was at various times. Hundreds of etchings, wood engravings, charts, and tables, as well as many photographs and color plates (lithographs, chromolithographs, albumen photographs, heliotypes, and woodburytypes) accompany the approximately 3,000 pages of densely printed text. (Almost every reproductive process available at the time can be found somewhere within the six volumes.) Editions and reprints Publication of the MSHWR was preceded by publication of the Reports on the Extent and Nature of the Materials Available for the Preparation of a Medical and Surgical History of the Rebellion (Surgeon General's Office; War Department, J. B. Lippincott, 1865). The MSHWR was reprinted (1990‚Äì1992) as The Medical and Surgical History of the Civil War (Broadfoot Publishing Company; editor, Dr. James I. (\\"Bud\\") Robertson, Jr., Alumni Professor of History, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, Virginia).

Since the early 2000s, advocates of video games have emphasized their use as an expressive medium, arguing for their protection under the laws governing freedom of speech and also as an educational tool. Detractors argue that video games are harmful and therefore should be subject to legislative oversight and restrictions. The positive and negative characteristics and effects of video games are the subject of scientific study. Academic research has examined the links between video games and addiction, aggression, violence, social development, and a variety of stereotyping and sexual morality issues.Freedman J. \\"Media violence and its effect on aggression: assessing the scientific evidence.\\" University of Toronto Press, Toronto 2002 . Areas of controversy Violence Video games since their inception have been the subject of concern due to the depictions of violence they may contain, which have heightened as the technology behind video games improve the amount of visual detail and realism of games. Video games are often seen as a possible cause to violent actions, notably in the aftermath of the 1999 Columbine High School massacre, but academic studies have yet to identify solid evidences linking violence in video games and violent behavior. The American Psychological Association stated, in 2015, that a correlation between the use of violent video games and aggressive behavior was observed. However, it was noted that ‚Äúthe interpretations of these effects have varied dramatically, contributing to the public debate about the effects of violent video games.‚Äù In 2017, Division 46 (Society for Media Psychology and Technology) of the American Psychological Association stated that \\"Scant evidence has emerged that makes any causal or correlational connection between playing violent video games and actually committing violent activities.\\" Despite the lack of solid evidence and academic consensus, politicians and activists have sought for ways to restrict the sale of violent video games, particularly to minors, on the basis that they can lead to violent behavior. Within the United States, the issues of video game sales regulation led to both the formation of the Entertainment Software Rating Board in 1994, and the 2011 Supreme Court of the United States landmark case Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association that ruled that video games are a protected class of free speech and blocking legislation on such sales restrictions. Sexual themes Tolerance of sexual themes in video games varies between nations. Controversy over sexual themes has occurred in the US. For instance, in June 2005, an entire portion of unused code was found within the main script of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, allowing the player to simulate sexual intercourse with the main character's girlfriends. This mode, entitled Hot Coffee, could be accessed in the PC version via mod, and through Action Replay codes in the PS2 and Xbox versions. The scene was left on the disc and could be accessed by altering a few bytes of the game's code via a hex editor. This feature prompted the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) to change the rating of San Andreas on 20 July 2005 to \\"adults only\\". Furthermore, the game was withdrawn from sale in many stores. Rockstar Games posted a loss of $28.8 million in that financial quarter. This event was dubbed the Hot Coffee mod controversy. The game RapeLay, a Japanese eroge with a storyline centering on the player's character stalking and raping a mother and her two daughters, also caused controversy. Campaigns against the sale of the game resulted in its being banned in many countries. RapeLay publisher, which intended the game only to be available in Japan, withdrew it from distribution. Since 2018, Sony has now issued new regulations for PlayStation 4 games with sexual content and fan service. For the localized release of Senran Kagura Burst Re: Newal, \\"Intimacy Mode\\", a mode where the player can play with the characters' bodies was removed, but by comparison, the same mode that was featured in previous titles like Senran Kagura: Estival Versus and Senran Kagura: Peach Beach Splash was not removed. PC release of Burst Re: Newal was not changed. The PS4 release of Nekopara Vol. 1 was censored for similar reasons, resulting in the game receiving an \\"E\\" rating by the ESRB by comparison to the \\"M\\" rating for versions on Nintendo Switch and PC. Sony claimed it was their decision to ban Omega Labyrinth Z outside of Japan due to its content.\\"PlayStation blocks launch of adult anime game Omega Labyrinth Z\\" According to Idea Factory International, the localized release of Date a Live: Rio Reincarnation will feature changes to certain event scenes and removal of illustrations that show characters in suggestive positions, although the PC version won't be changed./ Content regulation and censorship Support for video game regulation has been linked to moral panic.Byrd P. \\"It's all fun and games until somebody gets hurt: the effectiveness of proposed video game regulation.\\" Houston Law Review 2007.

Anderson, and Lori Bergen reiterated these claims in a 2008 book examining sociological effects on the production of media effects research. In 2013, the Entertainment Software Association, the lobbying group for the video game industry, had enlisted over 500,000 members to the \\"Video Game Voters Network,\\" a \\"grassroots\\" lobbying group to mobilize gamers to act against public policy that may negatively impact the gaming industry. The VGV was launched in 2006 by the ESA, and uses social media sites like Facebook and Twitter to inform members of allies and opponents. In 2013, the ESA spent over US$3.9 million on lobbying, including but not limited to against VVG legislation. This included opposing a bipartisan federal bill that would direct the National Academy of Sciences to study the effects of all forms of violent media. Such bills themselves had come under criticisms from some scholars for pressuring scientists to find specific outcomes rather than studying the issues neutrally.

Some ratings of controversial games indicate they are not targeted at young children (\\"Mature\\" (M) or \\"Adults Only\\" (AO) in the US, or 15 or 18 in the UK). The packaging warns such games should not be sold to children. In the US, ESRB ratings are not legally binding, but many retailers take it upon themselves to refuse the sale of these games to minors. In the United Kingdom (UK), the BBFC ratings are legally binding. UK retailers also enforce the PEGI ratings, which are not legally binding. =US government legislation= No video game console manufacturer has allowed any game marked AO to be published in North America; however, the PC gaming service Steam has allowed AO titles such as Hatred to be published on its platform. No major retailers are willing to sell AO-rated games. However, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas was rated AO after the presence of the Hot Coffee add-on became evident. The add-on was later removed and the game rated M. In the 109th Congress and 110th Congress, the Video Games Enforcement Act was introduced to the US House of Representatives. The act required an identification check for the purchase of M and AO rated games. The bill and others like it did not succeed because of likely First Amendment violations.\\"Video games ratings enforcement act.\\" FR Web Gate US government website.Triplett W. \\"Bill targets teen gamers.\\" Variety 7 May 2008. Although no law mandates identification checking for games with adult content, a 2008 survey by the Federal Trade Commission showed that video game retailers have voluntarily increased ID verification for M- and AO-rated games, and sales of those games to underage potential buyers decreased from 83% in 2000 to 20% in 2008. A further survey in April 2011, found that video game retailers continued to enforce the ratings by allowing only 13% of underage teenage shoppers to buy M-rated video games, a statistically significant decrease from the 20% purchase rate in 2009. On 7 January 2009, Joe Baca, representative of California's 43rd District, introduced H.R. 231, the Video game health labelling act. This bill called for a label to be placed in a \\"clear and conspicuous location on the packaging\\" on all video games with an ESRB rating of T (Teen) or higher stating, \\"WARNING: Excessive exposure to violent video games and other violent media has been linked to aggressive behavior.\\"\\"H.R. 231, Video game health labelling act.\\" Congressional bills, GPO access.Baca J. \\"Video game health.\\" US government.

The bill was once again passed onto the subcommittee. On 27 June 2011, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled on Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association. Video games were protected speech under the First Amendment. The case centered on a California law that sought to restrict sales of violent video games to minors. The video game industry, led by the Entertainment Merchants Association and the Entertainment Software Association, successfully obtained an injunction on the bill, believing that the definition of violence as stated in the California law was too vague and would not treat video games as protected speech. This opinion was upheld in lower courts, and supported by the Supreme Court's decision. The majority of the justices did not consider the studies brought to their attention as convincing evidence of harm, and stated that they could not create a new class of restricted speech that was not applied to other forms of media.\\"Arnold Schwarzenegger.

However, Justice Breyer's minority decision found the evidence more convincing. Deana Pollard Sacks, Brad Bushman, and Craig A. Anderson objected to the ruling, claiming that the thirteen experts who authored the Statement on Video Game Violence on the Brown side were considerably more academically merited, and had on average authored over 28 times as many peer-reviewed journal articles about aggression/violence based on original empirical research as the signatories supporting the EMA, whereas the over 100 signatories supporting Brown had on average authored over 14 times as many. Richard Hall, Ryan Hall, and Terri Day replied: \\"It is not surprising that Anderson and Bushman found their own qualifications and the qualifications of those who agree with them to be superior to the qualifications of those who disagree with them\\", and claimed that they might have used methodology which have undercounted contributions of some scholars. On 3 April 2013, Dianne Feinstein, a Californian senator and Democrat, spoke in San Francisco to a group of 500 constituents about gun violence. She said video games have \\"a very negative role for young people, and the industry ought to take note of that\\" and that Congress might have to step in if the video game industry did not cease to glorify guns.\\"Sen. Feinstein blames NRA, gun makers for derailing assault weapons ban.\\" CBS, San Francisco 3 April 2013, Accessed 1 August 2013. =Parental controls and resources= According to the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) and the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB), parents believe that parental controls on gaming consoles are useful. Parents have resources they can use to gain more knowledge about the media that their children are consuming. Researchers of video game violence, Dr. Cheryl Olson and Dr. Lawrence Kutner, have compiled a list of advice for parents who want to better monitor their children. The Entertainment Software Rating Board provides easy access to the ratings of a large database of video games. Common Sense Media is database which shows the ratings of movies, games, TV shows, and other media. For each piece of media, it lists a suggested age rating, and scales that measure positive messages, language, violence, drug use, and consumerism. It also provides a summary of the content of the media from a fellow-parent's perspective. The ESRB's website states that \\"Our rating system was established with the help of child development and academic experts, based on an analysis of other rating systems and what kind of information is valuable to parents. We found that consumers respond best to an age-based rating system that includes information about the content of a game. As games evolved, we found that parents place equal importance on understanding the ways in which some [video] games are played, such as interacting with others online and spending money on in-game items.\\" Portrayal of religion While religion is seen as a serious topic, video games are considered entertainment. As such, the use of religion and religious motifs in video games can sometimes be controversial. For example, Hitman 2: Silent Assassin (2002) sparked controversy due to a level featuring the killing of Sikhs within a depiction of their most holy site, the Harmandir Sahib. Portrayal of gender Some scholars have expressed the concern that video games may have the effect of reinforcing sexist stereotypes.Walling A. \\"Do video games lead to violent behavior in children?\\" American Family Physician 1 April 2002 65(7) p1. Accessed 7 September 2007. In 1998, a study by Dietz, conducted at the University of Central Florida, found that of thirty-three games sampled, 41% did not feature female characters, 28% sexually objectified women, 21% depicted violence against women, and 30% did not represent the female population at all. Furthermore, characterizations of women tended to be stereotypical: highly sexualized (\\"visions of beauty with large breasts and hips\\"), dependent (\\"victim or as the proverbial Damsel in Distress\\"), opponents (\\"evil or as obstacles to the goal of the game\\"), and trivial (\\"females depicted in fairly non-significant roles\\").Dietz T. \\"An examination of violence and gender role portrayals in video games: implications for gender socialization and aggressive behavior.\\" Sex Roles 1998 38(5-6) p425‚Äì442.

Accessed 7 March 2014. In 2005, Terry Flew, academic, expressed a similar opinion: gender bias and stereotyping exists in many games. Male characters are portrayed as hard bodied, muscled men while female characters are portrayed as soft bodied, nearly naked women with large breasts, portrayed in a narrowly stereotypical manner. Females are usually constructed as visual objects in need of protection who wait for male rescue, whereas men are portrayed with more power. According to Flew, such depiction of females in games reflects underlying social ideas of male dominance and themes of masculinity. Although not all video games contain such stereotypes, Flew suggests that there are enough to make it a general trait and that \\"...different genders have different gaming.\\"Flew T. and Humphreys S. \\"Games: technology, industry, culture.\\" Oxford University Press 2005. Portrayal of sexual orientation and gender identity Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) characters have been depicted in some video games since the 1980s, with Caper in the Castro in 1989 as one of the first games focusing on LGBT themes.

The portrayal of race in some video games such as the Grand Theft Auto series, Custer's Revenge, 50 Cent: Bulletproof, and Def Jam: Fight for NY has been controversial. The 2002 game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City was criticized as promoting racist hate crime. The game takes place in 1986, in \\"Vice City\\", a fictionalized Miami.

War-themed video games such as Medal of Honor: Warfighter and Call of Duty: Black Ops II have been criticized for how they portray Arab people and predominantly Islamic countries like Pakistan. Gaming addiction, gaming disorder, and other health-related concerns Video game addiction is the excessive or compulsive use of computer and video games that interferes with daily life. Instances have been reported in which users play compulsively, isolating themselves from family and friends or from other forms of social contact, and focus almost entirely on in-game achievements rather than broader life events.\\"Computer game addiction.\\" Berkeley Parents Network.

His 'Control of Space Invaders (and other Electronic Games) Bill' was put to the Commons and only narrowly defeated. One study from Chung Ang University observed that other structures affected by the use of video games include the anterior cingulate cortex and orbitofrontal cortex. The results from this experiment suggest an increase in stimulation of these areas, resembling a pattern similar to those with substance dependence. Researchers interpreted their results of this increase in activity of the anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortices to be an indication of an early stage of video game addiction. The World Health Organization has included \\"gaming disorder\\" in the 11th edition of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, which was approved by May 2019. It was defined as \\"a pattern of persistent or recurrent gaming behaviour ('digital gaming' or 'video-gaming')\\", defined by three criteria: the lack of control of playing video games, priority given to video games over other interests, and inability to stop playing video games even after being affected by negative consequences. The addition was contested by the video game industry and several academics, believing that its inclusion was too early and that more studies were needed. Outside of mental health, medical researchers are concerned that long-term playing of video games can lead to musculoskeletal issues, vision impairment, and obesity. Gaming culture and online harassment A further issue that can occur through gaming is online harassment or bullying behaviors. With its largely young, male-dominated population, gamers may exhibit habits and behaviors sometimes seen by outside groups as toxic and misogynistic, leading to harassment of other players. A specific example of harassing behavior occurring within a game can be found in Xbox Live services. With its online chat and party system, this leaves the service open to unwanted harassment, trolling, or bullying to occur between players. To address these concerns, Microsoft made improvements with reputation levels for a player's Xbox Live account. The system is set to warn, then punish bad behavior in hopes of better regulating Xbox Live accounts. The anonymous nature of the internet may be a factor of encouraging anti-social behavior. This type of behavior expands to other parts of the internet separate from gaming, such as online forums, social media sites, etc. Lack of accountability for one's actions on the internet may encourage others to engage in harassing behavior. Without minimal threat of punishment, some may find it easier to carry out negative behavior over online gaming. The Gamergate controversy that started in 2013 drew media attention to the negative portions of the culture of the video game community, highlighting the need to take steps against online harassment. Regarding whether attitudes towards women in games and gaming culture extend as far as misogyny, opinions have been divided. For example, VentureBeat writer Rus McLaughlin sees it as a status quo \\"ingrained in video-game DNA\\", while Joe Yang (writing for the same source) regards such claims to be misleading, and sees misogyny as a problem where it does occur, but disputes that it is inherent or normative, or that the whole culture should be described that way. Alt-right and far-right associations A connection between video gaming and the alt-right has been suggested, tied to the Gamergate controversy in 2014, which contributed to a culture war at that time that continued with the election of Donald Trump as United States President. The interactivity of video games may encourage players to gain enjoyment from far-right themes, which may potentially lead them to be more open to the extreme right positions, effectively being an incubator for the far right. Based on this, some alt- and far-right groups have been discovered to be organizing efforts to reach out to other players in various competitive online games and forums, typically to the younger and male ones, to indoctrinate them into their ways of thinking. Since these game chats and forums typically go unmoderated, it has been difficult to detect and prevent such recruitment from occurring. This has further been pushed by violent events, such as the 2017 Unite the Right rally where the Discord chat application developed for video game players was found to be hosting the far- right groups that were planning the rally, or the Christchurch mosque shootings, where the suspected perpetrator asserted that video games helped him accept ethno-nationalism and violence. Video game advocates have challenged the notion that video games are inherently right-wing. They argue games may allow play towards what would be alt- or far-right actions, but they can also be played to more liberal goals as well, and it is how the player chooses to play that should be of concern. Advocates caution that there is a lack of scale in the concerns raised; not all games foster the environments that would promote alt-right ideals or recruits, and many games are apolitical, simply meant to be enjoyed. Criminal activity Other common occurrences include online casino scams, phishing, cell phone dialers, malware in illegal downloads,Massively Multiplayer Online Fraud: Why the Introduction of Real World Law in a Virtual Context is Good for EveryoneVirtual worlds and fraud: Approaching cybersecurity in massive multiplayer online games and money laundering. Others have found ways to use a built-in systems for illegal profit, notably the use of skin gambling tied to games like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive drew attention to how in-game virtual items could be used for gambling for real-world funds. Workplace concerns Just as with representation of women, LGBT, and minorities in video games themselves, these groups also can be marginalized within the video game development industry in Western markets. The industry is primarily made up of Caucasian, heterosexual males, according to 2017 industry studies, a result of the marketing of video games during the 70s and 80s. Experts have stressed the need to draw underrepresented groups into the industry to help developers gain broader insights for the stories and characters for video games, so that new games will appeal to the largest possible audiences. Video game developers are considered creative professionals and thus typically do not qualify for overtime pay. Larger studios, particularly those backed by Triple A publishers, will frequently set game completion deadlines, and require employees to complete their tasks by this deadline, often requires several weeks of overtime work. This has become known as \\"crunch time\\" within the industry. While infrequent periods of crunch time are tolerated, there have been several reported cases where developers have been forced into a crunch time mode for months at a time, even well before a game's set completion deadline. Such practices have caused developers and other groups starting in 2018 for discussing unionization within the industry and establishing reasonable limits on crunch time and other workers' rights. Anti-consumer practices Digital rights management (DRM) is a type of technology that is intended to control the use of digital content and devices after purchase. Many companies make use of DRM to prevent copyright infringement and to protect an entity's intellectual property from public access.\\"The pros, cons, and future of DRM\\".

Accessed 5 March 2013. With the advent of digital distribution and online storefronts for video games, publishers and developers sought ways to further monetize the game as to obtain further revenue after the initial sale. Larger expansion packs led way to the nature of microtransactions, small purchases, typically under for a small benefit in the game. One of the first examples of this was a piece of horse armor for The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, which proved controversial. Publishers and developers would continue to develop other monetization methods, such as freemium games that are free to play but the player benefits by spending real-life money for in-game boosts. A more recent approach is the idea of loot boxes, popularized in games like Overwatch, where the player can purchase with either in-game or real-life funds a virtual box that contains a set of in-game items, with the items being distributed by various rarity levels. Loot boxes came under intense government and media scrutiny in 2018 as it felt these mechanics were too close or were like gambling, and would violate their local laws. Some countries like Denmark and the Netherlands banned the use of loot boxes, while other countries like the United States and United Kingdom urged the video game industry to voluntarily regulate the use of loot boxes. Environmental concerns The video game industry does contribute towards environmental concerns with how large it has grown in the 2010s. Both the sourcing of electronics hardware to make consoles and personal computers, and the generation of electricity for playing games are considered part of the industry's environmental footprint. Newer game technology such as cloud gaming utilize data centers which is also generally less energy efficient compared to traditional computing, though provide performance benefits. In the United States, as of 2019, it was estimated that the total power used by video games was about 34 TWh/year or 2.4% of the total domestic energy market, and associated 24 MT/year of carbon dioxide emissions, equivalent to that of 5 million gas-engine automobiles. Major console manufactures Sony and Microsoft have both committed to improving their console hardware to be more sustainable and reducing power requirements. Publicized incidents In the United States On 22 November 1997, Noah Wilson, aged 13, died when his friend, Yancy, stabbed him in the chest with a kitchen knife. Wilson's mother, Andrea Wilson, alleged her son was stabbed to death because of an obsession with the 1995 Midway game Mortal Kombat 3; that Yancy was so obsessed with the game that he believed himself to be the character, Cyrax, who uses a finishing move which Wilson claims involves taking the opponent in a headlock and stabbing them in the chest, despite the fact that Cyrax has never used this Fatality in any game he has appeared in. The court found \\"Wilson's complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\\"Wilson v. Midway Games, Inc. 198 F.Supp.2d 167, 27 March 2002. There have also been video game-related crimes which took place at schools. On 24 March 1998, 13-year-old Mitchell Johnson and 11-year-old Andrew Golden killed four students and a teacher in the Westside Middle School massacre. Although no connection to video games was drawn by the press at the time, the case was re-examined by commentators a year later, subsequent to the events of the Columbine High School massacre, and it was determined that the two boys had often played GoldenEye 007 together and they enjoyed playing first-person shooter games.Kent S. \\"The Mainstream and All Its Perils\\" The ultimate history of video games:...

In February of 2018, after 15-year-old Ben Walmsley of Greater Manchester, England, committed suicide, his father Darren later stated that he believed the visual novel Doki Doki Literature Club! may have contributed to \\"dragging\\" his son into a dark place, due to a subplot of the game involving two characters (Sayori and Yuri) suffering from depression who independently commit suicide. Walmsley also claimed that Ben had been frequently awoken at night due to text messages he attributed to coming from the game's characters, despite no such function existing in the game. In June of 2018, the controversy was discussed by Victoria Derbyshire on BBC News, and she called the game a \\"risk to children\\" and thought it should've had a higher age rating. The game being blamed for Ben's death, as well as the BBC interview discussing the controversy, was met with criticism on social media, with some being sick of video games being blamed for instigating tragic events, while others thought the game's discussion on the BBC was not necessary. Darren Walmsley was also criticized for claiming the video game characters had literally been sending his son text messages due to it not being a feature in the game.  Positive effects of video games  Some researchers claim that video games, more than causing no harm, are beneficial to social and cognitive development and psychological well-being. Certain scholars admit that games can be addictive, and part of their research explores how games connect to the reward circuits of the human brain. But they recognize the cognitive benefits of playing video games: pattern recognition, system thinking, and patience. Cognitive skills Action video game players have better hand‚Äìeye coordination and visuo-motor skills, such as resistance to distraction, sensitivity to information in the peripheral vision and ability to count briefly presented objects, than non-players. Through the development of the PlayStation Move, Kinect and Wii, video games can help develop motor skills through full body movement.Johnson S. Everything Bad Is Good For You. Penguin Group, New York 2005 p153-156. Furthermore, video games have also been linked with increased visual and attentional skills. Studies have shown that video game players were not only able to track 2 more objects on average than non video-game players, but were also more likely to recognize targets in a cluttered area. Experiments have indicated increases in cognition and problem solving skills in professional gamers. A common viewpoint is that playing video games is an intellectually lazy activity, but research suggests it may actually strengthen children's spatial navigation, reasoning, memory and perception skills. In 1994, a study conducted by the University of California in which fifth graders played extensive hours of video games, they managed to gain better spatial skills. The children were split into two groups, with the experimental group playing Marble Madness, while the control group played Conjecture. The distinction is important because Marble Madness requires spatial skills while Conjecture does not. The results may not be generalizable, since the sample of kids is taken from a single private school, and may not necessarily be representative of the population. The children practiced their respective game for forty-five minutes per session for three sessions, all on separate days. Appropriate pre- and post-tests were also assessed for spatial ability, on the day before and after the sessions. Irrespective of gender, practicing Marble Madness significantly increased spatial ability, especially in the children who had low performance on the spatial ability pre-test. Conversely, playing Conjecture did not increase children's spatial skills. This indicates that the type of game is important to consider when changes to cognitive abilities appear to be present. It is unknown if these increases in spatial ability persist into the long-term. This could mean that any benefits to practicing may only last if practice sessions are done at least intermittently. Relief from stress Olsen suggests video games can have social benefits for children, for example, video games can provide a topic of discussion and something over which children can bond, and can help children make friends; playing video games can increase a child's self-esteem when they are struggling in one aspect of their life, but are able to do something correctly in a video game; and, children can also learn to take on leadership roles within a multi-player online game. Christopher Ferguson, a psychologist well known for his video game research, conducted a study in which results suggest that violent games reduce depression and hostile feelings in players through mood management. According to a research paper done by Radboud University, creating positive emotions help to build motivation, relationships, and cope with failure. It also helps to monitor negative emotions such as anger, frustration or anxiety and control these emotions in order to achieve a goal (Isabela Granic, Adam Lobel, and Rutger C.M.E. Engels). By learning to motivate themselves, students could push themselves to achieve goals and improve their performance academically as they would improve their performance similarly in their video games. Also, social games that rely on interactions with other people would promote healthy relationships and better communication between their fellow students, teachers and others outside of school. This could also benefit the students to work harder in class to achieve better grades and learn from their mistakes and improve rather than become frustrated. As video games are a favored pastime among many students, having a game that promotes positive emotions will help to alleviate stress in the classroom, making the environment fun and sociable. Physical rehabilitation Studies have also tried using video games to assist in physical rehabilitation. Researchers used video games to provide physical therapy, improved disease self-management, distraction from discomfort, and increased physical activity, among other things. All of the above studies showed a significant improvement among testers.Primack, Brian A., Mary V. Carroll, Megan McNamara, Mary Lou Klem, Brandy King, Michael Rich, Chun W. Chan, and Smita Nayak. \\"Role of Video Games in Improving Health-Related Outcomes.\\" American Journal of Preventive Medicine. Elsevier Inc., June 2012. Web. 3 April 4014.

Not all video games are mindless. According to John L. Sherry, assistant professor at Michigan State University, 'educators are increasingly using educational games in the classroom as a motivational tool. The right video games help children master everything from basic grammar to complex math without the drudgery of old-school flash cards.' Certain studies indicate that video games may have value in terms of academic performance, perhaps because of the skills that are developed in the process. \\"When you play ... games you're solving puzzles to move to the next level and that involves using some of the general knowledge and skills in maths, reading and science that you've been taught during the day,\\" said Alberto Posso, an associate professor at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, after analysing data from the results of standardized testing completed by over 12,000 high school students across Australia. As summarized by The Guardian, the study [published in the International Journal of Communication], \\"found that students who played online games almost every day scored 15 points above average in maths and reading tests and 17 points above average in science\\". However, the reporter also stated that \\"[the] methodology cannot prove that playing video games were the cause of the improvement\\". The Guardian also reported that a Columbia University study indicated that extensive video gaming by students in the 6 to 11 age group provided a greatly increased chance of high intellectual functioning and overall school competence. In a study done in 2017 by the International Conference Educational Technologies they explored the educational purposes of the video game Minecraft. The results that they concluded from this experiment was that it increased collaboration between groups, increased problem solving skills, improved computer skills and more.https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED579314.pdf In an interview with CNN, Edward Castronova, a professor of Telecommunications at Indiana University Bloomington said he was not surprised by the outcome of the Australian study but also discussed the issue of causal connection. \\"Though there is a link between gaming and higher math and science scores, it doesn't mean playing games caused the higher scores. It could just be that kids who are sharp are looking for a challenge, and they don't find it on social media, and maybe they do find it on board games and video games,\\" he explained. Business skills In 1997, Herz and in 2006, Wade and Beck, authors, suggested video game playing may increase entrepreneurial skills. Herz argued that many so-called negative effects of video games, such as aggression and lack of pro-social behavior, are both necessary and useful traits to have in a capitalistic society. Specifically, Herz argued that many academic researchers have an anti-capitalist bias, and thus failed to notice the benefits of such traits.Wade J. and Beck M. \\"Got game : how the gamer generation is reshaping business forever.\\" Harvard Business School Press, Boston, Ma. 2006. [Nachdr.]Herz J. \\"Joystick nation: how video games ate our quarters, won our hearts and rewired our minds.\\" Little, Brown and Company, NY 1997. Pro- social behaviour In 2010, Tobias Greitemeyer and Silvia Osswald conducted a series of 4 experiments where some people played a prosocially themed video game, and others played a neutral video game. They found that the people who played the prosocial game were more helpful compared to the people who played the neutral game when another person had a mishap and asked for help. The people who played prosocial games were also more likely to assist in further experiments as a favor to the researcher, and more likely to step in and calm down a situation where someone was being harassed. In 2012, a study approved by Iowa State University assessed whether prosocial games could promote helpful behavior in children. In this study, children aged 9‚Äì14 years old played three different types of video games. They were first assessed for aggression in order to avoid confounding. Afterwards, they completed a puzzle task with a partner and then assigned tangrams to a fictitious person in another room. The participants were told that the person in the other room, who they did not know was not actually real, had an opportunity to win a prize. The children were told they were not eligible for the gift card. The measure for helpful or hurtful behavior was based on how many easy or difficult tangrams they assigned to the fictitious person. Results indicated that playing prosocial games significantly more helpful behaviors in children than those who played violent video games. Conversely, playing violent video games had significantly more hurtful behaviors in children than the children who played prosocial games. Deviations from the expected pattern were also non-significant. The short-term effects observed after only thirty minutes of playing are substantial enough to consider the possibility that the longer amount of time a child plays a video game, the more effect it will have on their behavior. The researchers concluded that playing prosocial games affects a child's social cognition, because it changes their attitudes and affect. It is also important to note that outside the confines of a study, playing a video game may affect how a child acts, but it is not the only factor present that can affect this. A study conducted in June 2014 at the University of Buffalo concluded that violent behavior in a virtual environment could lead to players' increased sensitivity of the moral codes that they violated, due to immoral behavior in video games eliciting guilt in players. Mental health disorders Studies have shown that video games, whether they are designed to be therapeutic or not, can be used to lower anxiety levels of those who suffer from chronic anxiety issues. Furthermore, a study done on children with mental disorders showed specifically designed therapeutic games, that provide a \\"lifelike alternate reality\\", which can help treat problems such as schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, and ADHD.‚Ä¢ Concepcion, H., (2017).

Notable participants included Nina Simone, B.B. King, , Chuck Jackson, Abbey Lincoln & Max Roach, The 5th Dimension, Gladys Knight & the Pips, Stevie Wonder, Mahalia Jackson, and Moms Mabley, among many others. For the concert featuring Sly and the Family Stone on June 29, 1969, the New York City Police Department (NYPD) refused to provide security, and it was instead provided by members of the Black Panther Party. Producer Hal Tulchin filmed the full concert series, though the majority of this film remains commercially unreleased. New York's affiliate television station WNEW Metromedia Channel 5 (now FOX) broadcast hour-long specials of the footage on Saturday evenings at 10:30 PM in June‚ÄìAugust 1969. The festival was hosted and promoted by Tony Lawrence, a New York night club singer. The concerts took place in Harlem's Mount Morris Park on Sundays at 3 PM from June 29 to August 24, 1969. Sponsors included Maxwell House Coffee, and the Parks, Recreation, and Cultural Affairs Division of the City of New York (now separated into Parks and Recreation and Cultural Affairs). The series had a combined attendance reaching nearly 300,000.

Splitting partitions is an alternative to deleting the partitions and creating new ones using software such as fdisk, the advantage of which is that the data is not lost. The most common use is installing multiple operating systems on a single computer. FIPS is free software, licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL).  Limitations  FIPS only works on primary partitions that are formatted using the File Allocation Table (FAT) filesystem. Most new machines with Windows pre-installed use NTFS, leaving FIPS obsolete for its intended purpose of resizing existing Windows installations to install Linux. In addition, FIPS cannot grow partitions due to technical limitations with the design, and partitions shrunk with it have some wasted space since it does not shrink the File Allocation Table. The filesystem to be shrunk must also be defragmented before FIPS is run - since FIPS does not move data, any data near the end of the partition prevents it from being resized. Alternatives These limitations have caused it to be largely superseded by more modern tools with better filesystem support, more advanced resizing methods and more complete partitioning functionality, such as: * GNU Parted ** GParted is a GTK+-based graphical version of Parted ** QtParted is a Qt-based graphical version of Parted ** Parted Magic * PartitionMagic * fdisk * cfdisk * diskpart  See also  * gpart * TestDisk References External links *. * with still downloadable FIPS and documentation.

Forman, is a former professor of religion at the City University of New York, author of several studies on religious experience, and co-editor of the Journal of Consciousness Studies. Biography Forman is a long-term Transcendental meditation practitioner, with over 40 years of practice.http://enlightenmentaint.com/, About Robert K.C. Forman After two years of practice he had his first \\"break-through\\" during a nine-month meditation retreat: This initial experience led him to pursuing a PhD at Columbia University, and an academic career in religious studies. Academic career Forman has worked as professor of religion at City University of New York, both Hunter College and City College, and is Founding Executive Director of The Forge Institute for Spirituality and Social Change. His books include The Problems of Pure Consciousness, The Innate Capacity and \\"Enlightenment Ain't What It's Cracked Up to Be\\". As well as editing a number of books on the topic of consciousness and mysticism, Forman has worked as co-editor of the Journal of Consciousness Studies. He has also collaborated with Ken Wilber on work (Forman, Wilber & Andresen, 2000). Criticism of constructivism Forman has taken a strong stance against Katz' constructivism, and can be understood as a defender of the perennialist position on mystical experience, the view that there is indeed a core experience common to mystics of all creeds, cultures and generations. Notable representatives of this perennial philosophy school, such as William James, Evelyn Underhill, James Bissett Pratt, Mircea Eliade and Walter Terence Stace, argue that mystical experience gives a direct contact with an absolute reality, which is thereafter interpreted according to one's religious and cultural background. This position has been strongly criticised by constructivists, most strongly and influently by Steven T. Katz, starting with his 1978 publication Mysticism and Pholosophical Analysis. According to Forman, these criticisms center around three points: # Perennialists have a naive and mistaken methodology in their approach of primary texts, which are mistranslated, quoted out of context, and misinterpreted; # Perennialists assume an underlying similarity without proving this. Their assumptions are the starting point for presenting quotes which superficially sound the same, without a thorough and careful analysis of these quotes and their context; # Perennialists are hermenuetically naive. They merely \\"divine\\" the experiences on which these texts are supposedly based, without a proper philosophical or methodological argument for the move from text to the postulated experience behind it. Forman has criticised the constructivist stance, specifically criticising Katz article Language, Epistemology and Mysticism (1978). According to Forman, Katz commits the fallacy of petitio principii, that is, making a statement without providing evidence, but only providing arguments. According to Forman, Katz' argument is systematically incomplete, since it implies that any difference in religious beliefs and assumptions leads to different experiences. Yet, according to Forman, the same experience may be described in different terms, such as samadhi and sunyata. Forman further criticises Katz for his inability to take into account novel experiences, of persons who are not trained in mystical traditions, which resemble trained mystical experiences, yet are not invoked by mystical practices. According to Forman, one can have a mystical experience, and only later recognise it as similar to those acquired in mystical traditions. Pure Consciousness Event =Description of PCE= Forman defines mysticism as \\"a set of experiences or more precisely, conscious events, which are not described in terms of sensory experience or mental images.\\" Following Roland Fischer, Forman makes a distinction between ergotropic and trophotropic mystical states. Ergotropic mystical states are hallucinations, visions and auditory experiences, whereas samadhi and other wakefull states are tropotropic. Forman restricts the term \\"mysticism\\" to the tropotropic states. Forman argues that there is a phenomenon which he calls the \\"Pure Consciousness Event,\\" a \\"wakefull though contentless (nonintentional) consciousness.\\" It is the same as samadhi, and a form of Walter Stace's introvertive mysticism. In transcendental meditation, it is called transcendental consciousness; it is the fourth of seven states of consciousness, and the first of four transcendental states of consciousness, which eventually end in full enlightenment. According to James H. Austin, commenting on Forman's descriptions of his personal experiences with this sense of silence and bottomlessness, Forman also stated that although background thoughts disappeared, there was also an \\"element of promise,\\" \\"a gratuitous subconscious process of incubation.\\" Forman himself gives the example of a student who asks him a question: \\"Although he is aware that his conscious mind is \\"completely silent,\\" yet the correct answer still pops up to the surface of his mind out of the background of this \\"richly pregnant silence.\\"\\" Forman equates sahaja samadhi with Stace's extroverted mysticism, noting that Stace considered \\"introverted mysticism\\" to be a higher form of mysticism than \\"extroverted mysticism.\\" Forman disagrees, referring to Ramana Maharshi, who repeatedly stated that sahaja samadhi, effortless samadhi, was a further development than samadhi, absorption. The same stance is taken in transcendental meditation, where the highest stages of consciousness continue throughout waking activity. According to Forman, constructivism is not able to account for the PCE as being a constructed event. According to Forman, a mystical experience may be shaped or constructed in three senses: content, form, shaping-process. All three fail for the PCE: # Form: PCE's are contentless, and therefore not shaped by \\"forms\\" or \\"schemata.\\" # Content: PCE's are contentless; they can also occur in neophytes;and they occur in various mystical traditions, despite their differences in states of religious beliefs and expectations. # Shaping-process: PCE's are not a series of events which shape each other, but are a continuous event of the same experience. Forman describes the stages leading to the PCE, such as the Buddhist formless jhanas, as a series of successive stages in which cognitive schemata are \\"forgotten,\\" leading to an \\"empty\\" state of consciousness. Forman questions the doctrine of intentionality insofar as he claims that, during a Pure Consciousness Event, cognition may lack an intentional object. =Criticism= Lola Williamson interviewed TM-practitioners. In contrast to Forman's statements she notes that those transcendent experiences show variations between various TM-practitioners, and are also not contentless. Yaroslav Komarovski (2015) notes that the idea of a PCE has a very limited applicability in Tibetan Buddhism. According to Komarovski, the realization of emptiness as described in the Buddhist Madhyamaka tradition is different from the PCE. Not only the realization itself is different, but also the causes and the subsequent influence on the personality. According to Komarovski, it is brought about by specific Buddhist techniques, and results in specific Buddhist objectives, thereby illustrating the opposite of what Forman argues. According to Komarovski, to force the PCE into the spectrum of Tibetan Buddhist practices, it would be, at best, one of the minor events, and not the key mystical experience. Rather, according to Komarvski, \\"certain experiences and mental states adresses by Tibetan thinkers are treated as PCE due to an oversimplification of and confusion about the nature of those experiences.\\"  Works  The Innate Capacity In The Innate Capacity, he gives the example of a man who had the Buddhist experience of satori, although not himself a Buddhist at the time, and only later learnt about satori. Indeed, even if one did learn about an experience and later have it, in Forman's view this does not prove that the learning causes the experience; to think in this way would, in Forman's view, be to commit the logical error of post hoc ergo propter hoc. Enlightenment Ain't What It's Cracked Up to Be Enlightenment Ain't What It's Cracked Up to Be, Forman's most popular book, is his most personal book. Using his own experience as a touchstone, the volume is an exploration into the experiential nuances of and nature of spiritual enlightenment. Forman describes both the illusions that many gurus have communicated about it, and the nature of the disillusionment process. Tapping his own 40 years of experience of such a permanent shift, Forman describes the long term value of enlightenment as he came to view it: the honesty and authenticity that it serves to encourage. The book teaches however mostly through its tone of honesty and authentic seeking, offering a teaching through the quality of writing and openness.  Publications  Books by Forman *Forman, R.K.C.

The season high for attendance was against Purdue. Schedule Game summaries Michigan In week 5, Minnesota met Michigan in the annual Little Brown Jug game. The game was matched No. 1 Michigan against No. 13 Minnesota. Michigan won the game, 27-14\\\\. Despite being held to 22 rushing yards, Michigan gained 261 yards on forward passes. At the start of the second quarter, Gene Derricotte fumbled a punt on Michigan's 15-yard line, recovered the ball, ran backward to the two-yard line, and fumbled again. All-American Leo Nomellini recovered the ball and carried it into the end zone to give Minnesota a 7-0 lead. Michigan drove to the Minnesota one-yard line on the next drive, but Tom Peterson fumbled and Minnesota recovered the ball at the 16-yard line. Two drives later, Michigan finally converted on a seven-yard touchdown pass from Wally Teninga to Tom Peterson. Less than 90 seconds after Peterson's tying touchdown, Michigan took the lead when Ed McNeill blocked a Minnesota punt, and Quentin Sickels recovered the ball at the one-yard line. Peterson ran it in for his second touchdown. Minnesota drove to Michigan's one-yard line at the end of the second quarter, but the clock expired and Michigan led 13-7 at halftime. Minnesota took a 14-13 lead in the third quarter on a 69-yard drive capped by a touchdown run by Everett Faunce. On the next possession, Michigan drove 77 yards and took a 20-14 lead on a 37-yard touchdown pass to Dick Rifenburg. Rifenburg fumbled the ball at the five-yard line, but recovered his own fumble and continued into the endzone. In the fourth quarter, Wally Teninga intercepted a Bill Elliott pass on Michigan's 11-yard line and returned the ball 26 yards. Chuck Ortman connected with Leo Koceski on a jump pass that covered 62 yards (the last 50 by Koceski after the reception) to give Michigan its fourth touchdown.

A turn-off notice, cut-off notice, or shut-off notice is a warning letter sent out by the provider of a service for a residence or other building, such as utility, phone service, or cable television, that if payment is not sent by the date indicated in the notice, the service will be interrupted. Turn-off notices, which are sent after a regular bill has been sent, but may resemble a bill, are generally sent several days to weeks before the planned date, giving the customer a sufficient amount of time to make a payment that would avert the interruption. Turn-off notices are often sent to those who are economically struggling, thereby having difficulty paying their bills on time, the absent- minded who are able to afford their bills but are disorganized in making timely payments, and to those who are out of commission to pay bills due to personal unforeseen circumstances, such as illness. In some cases, the turnoff notice may be necessary to obtain government or private aid in paying the bills.The Sun - Baltimore, Md. Date: Mar 15, 2002 Start Page: 3.B Many turn- off notices encourage the customer to make a payment by some method other than the postal service to ensure that the payment is received before the cut-off date. Some methods of payment that are commonly accepted include check or credit card over the phone or online, or payment at the main office or a satellite location of the service provider, which may charge a fee for accepting the bill. Averting the turnoff It is not uncommon for a customer who receives a turnoff notice to panic or to attempt to avoid the provider while silently dealing with the matter. But the general recommendation is to contact the service provider, which may be willing to grant an extension or otherwise work with the customer to keep payments up to date.The Sun - Baltimore, Md.

Hydrogen produced in this manner is often called biohydrogen. The conversion is effected by bacteria and protozoa, which employ enzymes. Fermentative hydrogen production is one of several anaerobic conversions. Dark vs photofermentation Dark fermentation reactions do not require light energy. These are capable of constantly producing hydrogen from organic compounds throughout the day and night. Typically these reactions are coupled to the formation of carbon dioxide or formate. Important reactions that result in hydrogen production start with glucose, which is converted to acetic acid: :C6H12O6 \\\\+ 2 H2O ‚Üí 2 CH3CO2H + 2 CO2 \\\\+ 4 H2 A related reaction gives formate instead of carbon dioxide: :C6H12O6 \\\\+ 2 H2O ‚Üí 2 CH3CO2H + 2 HCO2H + 2 H2 These reactions are exergonic by 216 and 209 kcal/mol, respectively. Using synthetic biology, bacteria can be genetically altered to enhance this reaction.Synthetic biology and hydrogen Photofermentation differs from dark fermentation, because it only proceeds in the presence of light. Electrohydrogenesis is used in microbial fuel cells. Bacteria strains For example photo-fermentation with Rhodobacter sphaeroides SH2C can be employed to convert small molecular fatty acids into hydrogen.High hydrogen yield from a two-step process of dark-and photo-fermentation of sucrose Enterobacter aerogenes is an outstanding hydrogen producer. It is an anaerobic facultative and mesophilic bacterium that is able to consume different sugars and in contrast to cultivation of strict anaerobes, no special operation is required to remove all oxygen from the fermenter. E. aerogenes has a short doubling time and high hydrogen productivity and evolution rate. Furthermore, hydrogen production by this bacterium is not inhibited at high hydrogen partial pressures; however, its yield is lower compared to strict anaerobes like Clostridia. A theoretical maximum of 4 mol H2/mol glucose can be produced by strict anaerobic bacteria. Facultative anaerobic bacteria such as E. aerogenes have a theoretical maximum yield of 2 mol H2/mol glucose.
