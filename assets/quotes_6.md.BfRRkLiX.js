It has never been officially released on cassette or CD, although it appears in its entirety on The Skinny Elvis, a retrospective multi-format compilation released by Touch and Go in 1993. The album's title and many of its themes were inspired by a growing dissatisfaction with elements of the Austin, Texas punk rock scene from which the Big Boys had spawned. Background In 1980, the infamous Austin club Raul's was sold to Steve Hayden, who implemented several policies that conflicted with the band's ideology ,Maximum Rock 'n Roll No. 76 - Sept. 1989 including the banning of cover songs to avoid paying publishing fees. Hayden funded the release of Live at Raul's Club, a split LP with fellow Austin punk rock band the Dicks, hoping the Big Boys' side would receive radio airplay based on its comparatively mild lyrical content. According to guitarist Tim Kerr, Hayden repeatedly justified his management decisions by claiming conformation to an industry standard.Maximum Rock 'n Roll No. 76 - Sept. 1989 The song Complete Control explored the band's relationship with Hayden. Spit was written about another local club, whose owner refused to let them play an agreed upon second set, claiming their stage presence distracted customers from purchasing alcohol.

Jewish expulsions and pogroms punctuated the time period: from Krakow in 1494, to Warsaw in 1527 to Silesia in 1559 and 1582. 30,000 Jews were killed in the Chmielnicki Uprising. After the second partition of Poland, Frederick the Great, considering the territory a new colony and its people like the Iroquois of North America, began a Prussian colonisation campaign which sought to replace the Polish language and culture with German. During World War II Poland was the main scene of the Holocaust, the Porajmos, and the Nazi atrocities against the Polish nation. These genocides varied in how, when and where they were applied; Jews and Romani were targeted for immediate extermination and suffered the greatest casualties, while the Poles were targeted for destruction and enslavement within 15‚Äì20 years.    * Robert Gellately has called the Nazi racial policy of cultural eradication and mass extermination of people based on ethnicity a serial genocide, since in its broader formulation it targeted multiple ethnic groups who the Nazis deemed \\"sub-human\\", including Ukrainians, Belorusians, Poles and Jews. In 2017, a far-right march gathered 60,000 participants chanting phrases including \\"We want God,\\" \\"Poland for Poles,\\" and anti-semitic slogans. Poland also has a major problem with racist football hooligans. The ruling Polish Law and Justice party has been described as far-right, and in Poland today the number of racist incidents is increasing. In 2013 there were more than 800 racially motivated crimes and in 2016 it had increased to over 1600.

As a result of better living conditions, 80% of the world's Jews lived in Poland by the mid-16th century.\\"Poland ‚Äì Virtual Jewish History Tour\\" at Jewish Virtual Library via Internet Archive.\\"Polish Jews History\\", at PolishJews.org via Internet Archive. During the 15th century in the royal capital of Krak√≥w, extremist clergymen advocated violence towards the Jews, who gradually lost their positions. In 1469 Jews were expelled from their old settlement and forced to move to Spiglarska Street. In 1485 Jewish elders were forced to renounce trade in Krak√≥w, which led many Jews to leave for Kazimierz which did not fall under the restrictions due to its status as a royal town. Following the 1494 fire in Krak√≥w, a wave of anti-Jewish attacks occurred. King John I Albert forced the remaining Jews of Krak√≥w to move to Kazimierz.The Torah Ark in Renaissance Poland: A Jewish Revival of Classical Antiquity, Ilia M. Rodov, Brill, pages 2-6 Starting in 1527, Jews were no longer admitted into the city walls of Warsaw (generally speaking, temporary stays were possible in the royal palace). Only the Praga suburb was open to them. They were likewise barred from all of Silesia by Ferdinand I in 1559 and by Rudolph II in 1582. The Council of Four Lands created in 1581 was a Jewish diet presided over by community elders from each major part of Poland, another governing body was established in Lithuania in 1623. Jewish communities were usually protected by the szlachta (nobles) in exchange for their work administering the nobles' domains. As such, they were often on the front line in revolts against the lords of the land, as was the case during the Cossack revolts in 1630, 1637 and 1639. It is estimated, in particular, that 30,000 Jews perished from 1648‚Äì9 as a result of the Chmielnicki Uprising. In Congress Poland, Jews gained civic rights with the ukase (edict) of 5 June 1862, two years before serfdom was abolished and the peasantry was freed. 35 years later, in 1897, the 1.4 million Jews represented 14% of the population of the Russian- administered partition, which included Warsaw and Lodz. In the Second Polish Republic, from the 1920s the Polish government excluded Jews: from receiving government bank credits, from public sector employment (in 1931, only 599 of 87,640 public servants were Jewish‚Äîin the domains of telephony, railroads, administration and justice), and from obtaining business licenses in the government-controlled sphere of the economy. From the 1930s, limits were placed on Jewish enrollment in university education, Jewish shops, Jewish export firms, Shechita, Jewish admission to the medical and legal professions, Jews in business associations, etc. While in 1921-22 25% of students were Jews, by 1938-9 the proportion went down to 8%. The far-right National Democracy (Endeks) organized anti-Jewish boycotts. Following the death of Poland's ruler J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski in 1935, the Endeks intensified its efforts and in 1937 it declared that its \\"main aim and duty must be to remove the Jews from all spheres of social, economic, and cultural life in Poland\\", which lead to violence in a few cases (pogroms in smaller towns). In response the government organized the Camp of National Unity (OZON), which took control of the Polish parliament in 1938. The Polish parliament then drafted anti-Jewish legislation which was similar to anti-Jewish laws which existed in Germany, Hungary, and Romania. OZON advocated the mass emigration of Jews from Poland, boycotts of Jews, numerus clausus (see also Ghetto benches), and other limitations on Jewish rights. According to Timothy Snyder, in the years leading up to World War II the Polish leadership \\"wanted to be rid of most Polish Jews... [but] in simple logistical terms the idea... seemed to make no sense. How could Poland arrange a deportation of millions of Jews while the country was mobilized for war? Should the tens of thousands of Jewish officers and soldiers be pulled from the ranks of the Polish army?\\" In the mid-20th century, notable incidents of antisemitism in Poland included the Jedwabne pogrom of 1941 in the presence of German Ordnungspolizei (police officers) and Anti-Jewish violence in Poland, 1944‚Äì46, attributed to postwar lawlessness as well as an anti-communist insurrection against the new pro-Soviet government immediately after the end of World War II in Europe, and the \\"≈ªydokomuna\\" (Jewish communism) stereotype.Marek Jan Chodakiewicz, After the Holocaust Polish-Jewish Conflict in the Wake of World War II, Columbia University Press, New York 2003, . Another major event took place during the 1968 Polish political crisis. The Jewish community in Poland made up about 10% of the country's total population in 1939, but was all but eradicated during the Holocaust.; also in In the Polish census of 2011, only 7,353 people declared either their primary or secondary ethnicity as Jewish. In 2017, the University of Warsaw's Center for Research on Prejudice found an increase in antisemitic views in Poland, possibly due to growing Islamophobia and anti-migrant sentiment. Later that year, the European Jewish Congress accused the Polish government of \\"normalizing\\" the phenomenon in the country. Despite the fact that Poland's Jewish population is currently scant, antisemitism persists and fulfills various important roles in Polish society. It is an informal tenet of Polish religiosity, enables Poles to view themselves as the main victims of the Nazis, enables them to deny their historic responsibility for anti-Jewish crimes, and provides a scapegoat for problems in the post-communist transition. Unlike other European societies, contemporary Polish antisemitism is not related to attitudes towards Israel. Furthermore, political representation of those employing antisemitic rhetoric is very limited.Bilewicz, Micha≈Ç, Miko≈Çaj Winiewski, and Zuzanna Radzik. \\"Antisemitism in Poland: Psychological, Religious, and Historical Aspects.\\" Journal for the Study of Antisemitism 4 (2016): 423-440., quote: Overall, the case of Poland is an example of the endurance of antisemitism without Jews‚Äîor at least with a scant Jewish population (Lendvai, 1971). This leads to an interesting question about the psychological reasons of such long-enduring prejudice without an object. Based on the research and observation of political and social life in Poland, one could say that antisemitism plays several important functions in contemporary Polish society: it is one of the informal tenets of religiosity in current Poland; it defines a scapegoat for the problems and troubles of the post-transition period; it allows the denial of responsibility for historical crimes toward Jews; and it supports perceiving the ingroup as the main victim of the Nazi occupation. These functions clearly allow antisemitism to exist‚Äîeven without any significant Jewish presence in the country. At the same time, however, there is no link between such antisemitism and attitudes toward contemporary Israel. In this case, Polish society is far less anti-Jewish than many other European societies; in addition, the political representation of antisemitic prejudice is very limited‚Äîmost politicians who were actively using antisemitic rhetoric are currently out of political life or at the margins of mainstream political debate One contemporary motif that is claimed to be antisemitic is the Jew with a coin picture, displayed in 18% Polish homes to bring luck. Roma In June 1991 the M≈Çawa riot occurred, which was a series of violent incidents against Polska Roma that broke out after one Polish man was killed and another Polish man was permanently harmed when a Romani teenager drove into three ethnic Poles in a crosswalk, killing one, then left the scene of the accident. After the accident a rioting mob attacked wealthy Romani settlements in the Polish town of M≈Çawa. Both the M≈Çawa police chief and University of Warsaw sociology researchers said that the pogrom was primarily due to class envy (some Romani have grown wealthy in the gold and automobile trades). At the time, the mayor of the town, as well as the Romani involved and other residents, said the incident was primarily racially motivated. During the coverage of the riot, a change in ethnic stereotypes about Roma in Poland was mentioned: A Roma is no longer poor, dirty, or cheerful. They also do not beg or pretend to be lowly. Nowadays a Roma drives a high status car, lives in a fancy mansion, flaunts his wealth, brags that the local authorities and the police are on his pay and thus he is not afraid of anybody. At the same time he is, as before, a swindler, a thief, a hustler, a dodger of military service and a holder of a legal, decent job.Anna Giza- Poleszczuk, Jan Poleszczuk, Raport \\"Cyganie i Polacy w M≈Çawie - konflikt etniczny czy spo≈Çeczny?\\" (Report \\"Romani and Poles in M≈Çawa - Ethnic or Social Conflict?\\") commissioned by Centre for Public Opinion Research, Warsaw, December 1992, pp. 16- 23, Sections III and IV \\"Cyganie w PRL-u stosunki z polskƒÖ wiƒôkszo≈õciƒÖ w M≈Çawie\\" and \\"Lata osiemdziesiƒÖte i dziewiƒôƒádziesiƒÖte\\". Negative \\"metastereotypes\\" ‚Äì or the Romas' own perceptions regarding the stereotypes that members of the dominant groups hold about their own group ‚Äì were described by the Polish Roma Society in an attempt to intensify the dialogue about exclusionism.  Ukrainians  During the second half of the last millennium, Poland experienced significant periods of time where its feudal economy was dominated by serfdom. Many serfs were treated in condescending fashion by the nobility (szlachta), and had few rights. While many serfs were ethnic, Catholic Poles, many others were Orthodox Ruthenians, later self-identifying as Ukrainians. Some scholars described the attitudes of the (mostly Polish) nobility towards serfs as a form of racism. In modern Poland, where Ukrainians form a significant minority of migrant workers, they are subject to occasional racism in everyday life.Mniejszo≈õƒá ukrai≈Ñska i migranci z Ukrainy w Polsce, ZwiƒÖzek Ukrai≈Ñc√≥w w Polsce, 2019Marcin Deutschmann, Rasizm w Polsce w kontek≈ìcie problem√≥w migracyjnych.

It is often regarded as a neutral word to describe a person of black (Sub-Saharan African) ancestry, but nowadays many consider it pejorative with dictionaries reflecting this. Professor Marek ≈Åazi≈Ñski has said that \\"Murzyn\\" is now \\"archaic\\". Perceptions of black people have also been shaped by literature. Henryk Sienkiewicz‚Äôs novel In Desert and Wilderness contains the famous character Kali, who speaks broken English and has a dubious morality. In 1924 poet Julian Tuwim published Murzynek Bambo (\\"The little Murzyn Bambo\\") which became much-loved despite being heavily criticised for othering black people. Under Communism Uncle Tom‚Äôs Cabin, by Harriet Beecher Stowe, was translated quite freely and targeted at children, reinforcing various black stereotypes.[https://time.com/5874185/poland-racism-women- murzyn/ Time.com One high-profile event with regard to blacks in Poland was the death of Maxwell Itoya in 2010, a Nigerian street vendor from a mixed marriage who was selling counterfeit goods. He was shot in the upper leg by a policeman during a street brawl that followed a screening check at a market in Warsaw and died of a severed artery.Piotr Machajski (28 June 2013), Milion z≈Ç za zastrzelonego mƒô≈ºa? ≈ªona chce odszkodowania. Wyborcza.pl. The event led to a media debate regarding policing and racism. There have been other cases of violence against black people in recent years. In Strzelce Opolskie, black football players from LZS Piotr√≥wka club were attacked in a bar by fans of the opposing team Odra Opole in 2015 and two young men were arrested.TVN 24 Wroc≈Çaw (7 April 2015), Pobicie czarnosk√≥rych pi≈Çkarzy.

Ethnic Poles  Through Poles generally have formed a majority in Poland, particularly during the times of partitions of Poland (mid-18th century to 1918) most of the Polish territories were under control of other nations, and Poles, effectively minorities in nationalistic German Empire and Russian Empire, were subject to discrimination and racism. German Empire Racist publications about Poles appeared as early as the 18th century, and they were imbued with Medieval ethnic stereotypes and racist overtones in order to justify German rule over Polish territories.The Racial State: Germany 1933-1945 Michael Burleigh, Wolfgang Wippermann, page 26-27 Authors such as Georg Forster wrote about Poles that they are \\"cattle in human form\\".The Sarmatian Review, Tomy 22-25 When part of Poland was under the rule of the German Empire, the Polish population was discriminated against by racist policies. These policies gained popularity among German nationalists, some of whom were members of the V√∂lkisch movement, leading to the expulsion of Poles by Germany. This was fueled by Anti-Polish sentiment, especially during the age of partitions in the 18th century. The Kulturkampf campaign led by Otto von Bismarck resulted in legacy of anti- Polish racism; in turn Polish population experienced oppression and exploitation at hands of Germans. The racist ideas of Prussian state directed against Polish people were taken on by German social scientists, in part led by Max Weber. Nazi Germany No entrance for Poles!\\" Concentration camp badge with the letter \\"P\\" to identify people of Polish ethnicity, which Polish slave laborers and inmates were required to wear in occupied Poland during World War II During World War II Poland was occupied by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union and Polish people were harshly discriminated against in their own country. In directive No. 1306, issued by Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda on 24 October 1939, the concept of untermenschen (subhuman) is cited in reference to Polish ethnicity and culture: Most Nazis considered the Poles, like the majority of other Slavs, to be non-Aryan and non-European \\"masses from the East\\" which should be either totally annihilated along with the Jews and Gypsies, or entirely expelled from the European continent. Poles were the victims of Nazi crimes against humanity and some of the main non-Jewish victims of the Holocaust. Approximately 2.7 million ethnic Poles were murdered or killed during World War II. Nazi policy towards ethnically Polish people was eventually the genocide and destruction of the whole Polish nation, as well as cultural genocideWilliam Schabas, Genocide in international law: the crimes of crimes, Cambridge University Press, 2000, , Google Print, p.179 which involved Germanisation, as well as the suppression or murder of religious, cultural, intellectual, and political leadership. On March 15, 1940, Heinrich Himmler stated \\"All Polish specialists will be exploited in our military-industrial complex. Later, all Poles will disappear from this world. It is imperative that the great German nation considers the elimination of all Polish people as its chief task.\\" Poland's Holocaust: Ethnic Strife, Collaboration with Occupying Forces and Genocide in the Second Republic, 1918-1947 by Tadeusz Piotrowski page 23 2007 The goal of the policy was to prevent effective Polish resistance and to exploit Polish people as slave laborers and foresaw the extermination of Poles as a nation.Adolf Hitler: A Biographical Companion David Nicholls, Gill Nicholls ABC-CLIO 2000, page 201 Polish slaves in Nazi Germany were forced to wear identifying red tags with the letter P that were sewn to their clothing. Sexual relations with Germans (rassenschande or \\"racial defilement\\") were punishable by death. During the war many Polish men were executed for their relations with German women. In 1942, racial discrimination became Nazi policy with the Decree on Penal Law for Poles and Jews.Nazism, War and Genocide: Essays in Honour of Jeremy Noakes Jeremy Noakes, Neil Gregor University of Exeter Press, 2005, page 85 During post-war Trials of Nazis it was stated during Trial of Ulrich Freifelt that: \\"The methods applied by the Nazis in Poland and other occupied territories, including once more Alsace and Lorraine, were of a similar nature with the sole difference that they were more ruthless and wider in scope than in 1914-1918. In this connection the policy of \\" Germanizing \\" the populations concerned, as shown by the evidence in the trial under review, consisted partly in forcibly denationalising given classes or groups of the local population, such as Poles, Alsace-Lorrainers, Slovenes and others eligible for Germanization under the German People‚Äôs List. As a result in these cases the programme of genocide was being achieved through acts which, in themselves, constitute war crimes\\"Law Reports of the Trials of War Criminals. United Nations War Crimes Commission. Vol. XIII. London: HMSO, 1949 Trial of Ulrich Greifelt and Others, United States Military Tribunal, Nuremberg, 10 October 1947 ‚Äì 10 March 1948, Part IV Likewise, during World War II around 120,000 Polish people, mostly women and children, became the primary victims of an ethnicity-based genocide by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, which was then operating in the territory of occupied Poland. Studies and surveys= 2008 EVS survey  An analysis based on the European Values Survey (EVS), which took place in 2008, compares Poland to other European nations. Poland had very high levels of political tolerance (lack of extremist political attitudes), relatively high levels of ethnic tolerance (based on attitudes towards Muslims, immigrants, Romas, and Jews) and at the same time low levels of personal tolerance (based on attitudes towards people considered \\"deviant\\" or \\"threatening\\"). From 1998 to 2008, there was a marked increase in political and ethnic tolerance, but a decrease in personal tolerance. In 1990, due partly to the political euphoria accompanying the fall of communism, Poland was the most tolerant nation in Central Europe. However, over the course of the '90s, the level of tolerance decreased. By 1999, EVS recorded Poland as having one of the highest rates of xenophobia in Europe, while antisemitism also increased during this time. The factors behind these decreases in tolerance and the radicalization in attitudes towards other ethnic groups during this time likely included the country's economic problems associated with a costly transition from Communism (for example, high unemployment), ineffectual government and possibly an increase in immigration from outside. These attitudes began to change after 2000, possibly due to Poland's entry into the European Union, increased travel abroad and more frequent encounters with people of other races. By 2008, the EVS showed Poland as one of the least xenophobic countries in Central and Eastern Europe. The negative attitudes towards Jews have likewise returned to their lower 1990s level, although they do remain somewhat above the European average. During the same time period, ethnic tolerance and political tolerance increased in Southern Europe (Spain, Greece) and decreased in other parts of Northern Europe (Netherlands). While the Roma group was listed as most rejected, the level of exclusion was still lower than elsewhere in Europe, most likely due to the long history of Roma (see Polska Roma) and their relatively low numbers in the country.  2012 CRP survey  In a 2012 survey conducted by the Center for Research on Prejudice at the University of Warsaw, it was found that 78.5% of participants disagreed with traditional antisemitic statements (e.g. \\"Jews are responsible for the death of Jesus Christ\\"), but 52.9% agreed with secondary antisemitic statements (e.g. \\"Jews spread the stereotype of Polish anti-Semitism\\"), and 64.6% believed in a \\"Jewish conspiracy\\" (e.g. \\"Jews would like to rule the world\\"). The authors noted that \\"belief in [a] Jewish conspiracy proved to be the strongest significant predictor of discriminatory intentions towards Jews in all fields. Traditional anti-Semitism predicted social distance towards Jews, while it did not predict any of the other discriminatory intentions. Secondary anti-Semitism failed to predict any form of discriminatory intentions against Jews.\\"  2014 ADL Global 100 survey  In the ADL Global 100 survey conducted in 2013‚Äì2014, 57% of respondents said that \\"it is probably true\\" that \\"Jews have too much power in the business world\\"; 55% that \\"Jews have too much power in international financial markets\\"; 42% that \\"Jews have too much control over global affairs\\"; and 33% that \\"people hate Jews because of the way Jews behave\\".  2018 FRA survey  In the FRA 2018 Experiences and perceptions of antisemitism/Second survey on discrimination and hate crime against Jews in the EU, antisemitism in Poland was identified as a \\"fairly big\\" or \\"very big\\" problem by 85% of respondents (placing Poland at the fourth place after France, Germany and Belgium); 61% reported that antisemitism had increased \\"a lot\\" in the past five years (second place after France, and before Belgium and Germany); 74% reported that intolerance towards Muslim had increased \\"a lot\\" (second place after Hungary, and before Austria and the UK); and 89% reported an increase in expressions of antisemitism online (second place after France, and before Italy and Belgium). The most commonly heard antisemitic statements were \\"Jews have too much power in Poland\\" (70%) and \\"Jews exploit Holocaust victimhood for their own purposes\\" (67%).  Countering racism = Government action  In 2004, the government took some initiatives in order to tackle the problem of racism. It adopted the \\"National Programme to Prevent Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance 2004-2009\\" (\\"Krajowy Program Przeciwdzia≈Çania Dyskryminacji Rasowej, Ksenofobii i ZwiƒÖzanej z Nimi Nietolerancji 2004 ‚Äì 2009\\"http://wiadomosci.ngo.pl/files/rownosc.ngo.pl/public/prawo_polskie/KP_przec_dyskr_ras.pdf Krajowy Program Przeciwdzia≈Çania Dyskryminacji Rasowej, Ksenofobii i ZwiƒÖzanej z Nimi Nietolerancji 2004 ‚Äì 2009 (retrieved December 8, 2016)) and also established the Monitoring Team on Racism and Xenophobia within the Ministry of Interior and Administration.

It was developed by manga artist Hato Moa's d≈çjin circle PigeoNation Inc., and is the successor of a Flash game of the same name she created for April Fools' Day in 2011. A free demo version of Hatoful made with the FamousWriter engine was released later that year, followed by a full commercial version released on 30 October 2011 at COMITIA 98, and an English version released in February 2012. An international remake by developer Mediatonic and publisher Devolver Digital, dubbed Hatoful Boyfriend HD in Japan, was released on 4 September 2014 for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux and for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita on 21 July 2015 in North America, and on 22 July 2015 in Europe, respectively. A port for iOS was released on 25 May 2016. Hatoful Boyfriend received generally positive reception; reviewers praised the game's replay value as well as its writing and characterization, while repetitive gameplay and the accessibility of the game's Bad Boys Love mode received a more mixed response. A sequel, Hatoful Boyfriend: Holiday Star, was released on 29 December 2011, with an English version being released on Christmas Day the following year. In addition to the main games in the series, Hatoful Boyfriend has made transitions into other media: a monthly webcomic was serialized in the anthology Manga Life WIN+, several supplementary materials and official d≈çjin works have been released, and four drama CDs based on the series have been made. An episodic web series began in 2014.  Gameplay  Hatoful Boyfriend is an interactive text-based visual novel that follows a branching plot line, with the player's decisions determining which of the game's multiple endings they receive. The title is a pun on the wasei-eigo word , and the Japanese word , as the game features pigeons and other birds as major characters. The game is set in a version of Earth populated by sapient birds, and its main story follows the player character and protagonist‚Äîthe only human attending St. PigeoNation's Institute, an elite school for birds‚Äîas she finds love among her avian acquaintances. Bad Boys Love, a hidden alternate story mode, opens with the discovery of the protagonist's corpse, after which the player follows her best friend Ryouta Kawara as he investigates the circumstances of her death and unravels darker conspiracies surrounding the school. Gameplay in Hatoful Boyfriend is similar to most other visual novels for the PC, with the controls limited to the mouse and the only interactions being clicking to forward the game's narrative or to choose between multiple plot choices. The keyboard can also be used instead of the mouse, with the 'enter' key serving the same purpose as clicking. The save button can be employed at any point during the game, which also features several pages of save slots, allowing gameplay to be easily picked up from prior to a choice the player made. An arrow button in the upper right corner also allows the player to skip dialogue and interactions they have already experienced. The player assumes control of the protagonist, a teenage human girl. As the game follows a branching plot line with multiple endings, at various points during gameplay the player is allowed to make choices that determine which character's romance route the player will encounter. On weekdays, the player can also choose which classes to attend, which changes one of the protagonist's three stats depending on the activity chosen. Having certain stat values are required to obtain the good endings for each love interest and to otherwise advance along certain routes. There are thirteen (fourteen in the 2014 remake) endings in total: one ending for each of the main love interests, three extended endings for three of the love interests based on stat values, one ending for the gaiden-esque Torimi Caf√© storyline, and one ending attained if the player fails to romance any character. When routes are completed, documents are unlocked that provide insights into the game's overarching storyline. These documents can be viewed at any time in the game's archive feature, which is accessed from the title screen. After obtaining the four specific endings required to trigger it, the player is given a new prompt to either \\"fulfill the promise\\" or live \\"a normal life\\" upon starting a new game. Choosing to live a normal life will result in a normal playthrough, while choosing to fulfill the promise locks the player into the true route or scenario Bad Boys Love, or BBL (also known as Hurtful Boyfriend), which explores the full extent of the underlying plot alluded to by the documents and various points of foreshadowing in the dating simulation portion of the game. If the player chooses to fulfill the promise, aside from several dream sequences, gameplay at first appears to continue normally until the in-game date is 2 September. The player's perspective then switches from the protagonist to the protagonist's best friend, and the events of the scenario begin regardless of any other choices made by the player up to that point. If the player obtains all other possible endings prior to starting Bad Boys Love, an extended epilogue plays after the game's credits upon completion of the scenario. In a departure from the generally lighthearted romantic routes, Bad Boys Love is presented as a murder mystery psychological thriller, and is significantly longer than any other route in Hatoful Boyfriend, making up most of the game's actual length. There are several changes to gameplay and the way text is displayed during Bad Boys Love in the original version of the game: saving is disabled except at certain points in the story, the function to skip dialogue and interactions is removed, and plot-important dialogue and narrative are highlighted with colored text; usually yellow, though text of particularly critical importance is highlighted in red. In the 2014 remake however, the option to save is available at all times, the skip function is retained, and text is no longer highlighted. In both versions, the game's interface and controls change from that of a standard visual novel to similar to that of a '90s-era turn-based role-playing game during certain segments of the narrative.  Plot = Setting  Hatoful Boyfriend is set in an alternate version of Earth in which sapient birds have seemingly taken the place of humans in society for reasons that are hinted at, but not fully explained in the dating simulation portion of the game. In Bad Boys Love, it is revealed that Hatoful is set in a post-apocalyptic, dystopian future‚Äîin which a pandemic of a deadly, mutated strain of the H5N1 virus, or bird flu, nearly wipes out mankind in the year 2068. The release of a counter-virus, cultivated to destroy the virus' avian carriers in a desperate attempt to stop the spread of the disease, ends up backfiring as birds who resisted the counter-virus instead developed human-level intelligence. War soon breaks out between the newly uplifted birds and the remnants of humanity, resulting in birds emerging as the planet's new dominant lifeforms as humans continued to succumb to the disease. Following several terrorist attacks by a human insurgency, all remaining humans have been forced to live in the wilderness away from civilization in a form of apartheid-like segregation. The game's story takes place primarily at ‚Äîa bird-only high school located in the fictional Japanese town of ‚Äîlong after open warfare between humans and birds has ended. Society has adjusted to the avian conquest, though with minor bird- related cultural changes‚Äîfor example, while some holidays such as Christmas and Tanabata are celebrated much as they are in the present day, a major event in the game is Legumentine's Day, an amalgamation of the traditions of Valentine's Day and Setsubun. In a more grim case, the terms war dove and war hawk have been re-purposed as labels for two opposing political factions divided over the ongoing mutual hostility between birds and the human minority: the altruistic Dove Party, who advocate for cooperation and peace between the two groups, and the militant Hawk Party, whose goal is to exterminate humanity altogether. By the time Hatoful Boyfriends narrative begins, the Dove Party, the Hawk Party, and their respective schools of thought dominate much of the world's politics.  Characters  The primary playable character in Hatoful Boyfriend is the human protagonist, a boisterous hunter-gatherer who lives in a cave in the wilderness. Her eight potential love interests in the original version of the game, who together form the rest of the main cast, are Ryouta Kawara, a rock dove and the protagonist's sickly but hardworking childhood friend; Sakuya Le Bel Shirogane, a fantail pigeon and snobbish French aristocrat; Sakuya's older half-brother Yuuya Sakazaki, a popular and flirtatious but strangely secretive fantail pigeon; Nageki Fujishiro, a quiet, bookish mourning dove who never seems to leave the library; San Oko, an athletic, hyperactive fantail pigeon who is obsessed with pudding; Anghel Higure, an eccentric Luzon bleeding-heart who behaves as if he were in some kind of fantasy role-playing game; Kazuaki Nanaki, a kind but narcoleptic button quail and the protagonist's homeroom teacher; and Shuu Iwamine, a creepy, antisocial chukar partridge who serves as the school's doctor. Azami Koshiba, a no-nonsense Java sparrow and takoyaki saleswoman, and Tohri Nishikikouji, a golden pheasant and Iwamine‚Äòs long-forgotten work rival, became possible love interests in the 2014 remake. While most of the characters are normally represented in-game with pictures of birds, if the player toggles on the ICPSS (Intra-Cerebral Playback Synchro System) feature at the start of the game, or in Japan, each of the possible love interests is shown with a version of what they would look like as a human when first introduced. Although the ICPSS feature also lists voice credits for each of the main love interests in the original version of the game, the game itself is unvoiced; however most of the voice actors who were credited later signed on to actually voice their respective characters in the drama CDs based on the series.  Story  The events of Hatoful Boyfriend begin in the year 2188, when the protagonist, a teenage human girl invited to attend the prestigious bird-only St. PigeoNation's Institute, starts her second year of high school. After a hectic and surreal freshman year of attendance at St. PigeoNation's, the protagonist has grown accustomed to the confusion of being the only human in a school full of birds, and is looking forward to her sophomore year. The story of the dating simulation portion of the game follows the protagonist, and the inter-species love and hijinks‚Äîof both the mundane high school and quasi-anthropomorphic bird-specific varieties‚Äîthat ensue as she draws the attention of and attempts to romance one of a number of eligible birds she comes in contact with over the course of the year. = Bad Boys Love = Should the player choose to fulfill the promise, the protagonist begins her sophomore year at St. PigeoNation's largely as normal, but with one exception‚Äîshe begins to have recurring dreams of her younger self and Ryouta, and her parents lying dead in front of an unfamiliar house. A mysterious man approaches them, promising to grant any wish that they make. On 2 September, she decides to check on Ryouta, who had gone to the infirmary earlier that day; the next morning, she fails to show up for class. Kazuaki asks Ryouta to retrieve their class' box of print handouts, and upon retrieving it, blood is discovered leaking from a corner of the box. Ryouta opens the lid, and it is revealed that the box contains the protagonist's severed head. A siren sounds and there is an order to evacuate to the gymnasium, where Ryouta overhears other students mention that more pieces of a human corpse were found in the other print boxes. Doubting the headmaster's explanation of a natural disaster occurring, Sakuya and Ryouta resolve to figure out the identity of the protagonist's killer and leave the gymnasium, discovering a large metal dome surrounding the school. Upon returning to their classroom and finding the box empty, Yuuya explains that the protagonist's body had been gathered in the chemistry lab, where Shuu performs an autopsy concluding that the protagonist died of asphyxiation caused by illness or poison with the dismemberment occurring afterwards. horror are prevalent throughout the scenario. Assisted by the school janitor Mister One, and pursued by a grotesque scarecrow-like being named Labor 9 who suddenly appears on the school grounds, Ryouta and Sakuya begin investigating the dome and the murder. They visit the lab and compare alibis; Shuu, who Ryouta distrusts, asks if Ryouta has forgotten anything important, to which he replies that he hasn't. Upon investigating the headmaster's office, they discover the headmaster had likewise been poisoned to death, what they saw earlier being merely pre-recorded footage; they also find a computer and a pair of documents, one titled The Human Representative and a torn, unreadable one titled Operation Hatoful. The Human Representative reveals that if the protagonist, a symbol of humanity, were to die, the campus would be sealed off and the birds inside handed over to humans as sacrifices‚Äîsomething confirmed when the computer is used to open a small hatch in the dome and students are shot dead as they attempt to flee‚Äîwhen the dome is lifted twelve hours after her death is reported. In trying to find a way to escape before the dome rises, Ryouta and Sakuya uncover records in the library mentioning a medical center that was shut down due to a fire, and that the ghostly Nageki, who Ryouta previously encountered, died in that fire. Sakuya deduces that an unused building on campus was the medical center and after investigating, they find its basement blocked off. They also encounter Anghel, who recalls the protagonist going into the infirmary the day before, contradicting Yuuya and Shuu's shared alibi. As Ryouta searches the infirmary for clues, he finds medical records for himself, the protagonist, Nageki, and Sakuya, but is knocked out immediately after. When he regains consciousness, he discovers the protagonist's bloody student ID‚Äînow with concrete evidence, Ryouta prepares to confront the doctor and Yuuya, only to find that Sakuya had left to do so alone. Ryouta returns to the infirmary as Yuuya shields Sakuya from Shuu's attempts to kill him; the doctor tells Ryouta that he will be waiting for him in the medical center's basement before escaping with Labor 9. Yuuya apologizes, affirming that while neither he nor Shuu killed the protagonist, they were the ones who dismembered her, and asks to speak to Sakuya alone. He reveals that they are full-blooded siblings, with Shuu using knowledge of Sakuya's true heritage to blackmail Yuuya into assisting him. Yuuya seemingly dies, Shuu's scalpel having been laced with the same neurotoxin that killed the headmaster, leaving Sakuya in a state of shock. Ryouta, searching for a way into the medical center basement, seeks out Nageki, a ghost, in the library to ask him about his death. Upon discovering documents revealing that Operation Hatoful was a Hawk Party project into developing biological weapons for use against humans using the school as an experimental facility‚Äîwith a focus on a strain of H5N1 almost immediately lethal to humans dubbed the Charon virus‚ÄîNageki recalls that the fire was caused by his committing suicide by self-immolation after months of forced experimentation in order to destroy and remove any trace of the virus, which was isolated in his body, and that researchers often went in through the chemistry preparation room. Ryouta, Kazuaki, and Anghel make their way into the medical center's basement through the chemistry lab and encounter Labor 9, electrocuting it using a stun gun given to Ryouta earlier by Mister One. They confront Shuu, who imprisons Kazuaki and Anghel, leaving them to die of poison gas before leading Ryouta away. Meanwhile, San comforts Sakuya, and the two of them arrive to break Anghel and Kazuaki out of the prison. Alone with Shuu, Ryouta finally remembers what he had forgotten due to the traumatic nature of the events: he recognizes the doctor as a man who promised to grant his wish for peace between birds and humans after he and the protagonist witnessed a human terrorist incident at a bird orphanage in which the protagonist's parents, crisis negotiators, were killed, and that the protagonist died when she visited him in the infirmary. It is revealed that she died by Charon virus after coming in contact with Ryouta, as Shuu had induced the virus into Ryouta's body though grafts from Nageki's remains for the purpose of using him to exterminate humanity‚Äîsince there can be no more fighting between two factions if one is wiped out, this would grant Ryouta's wish. Shuu then remarks that Labor 9 was powered by the protagonist's now irreversibly damaged brain. A broken Ryouta submits to Shuu's offer of becoming a living weapon of mass destruction after these revelations, and a struggle ensues during which the protagonist's spirit intervenes. Ryouta then asks Shuu why he decided to grant his wish, to which it is implied that Shuu's affection towards Ryouta's deceased father, Ryuuji, was greater than Shuu himself would like to admit, and that he was motivated by Ryuuji's dying request: to do something for his son. Shuu admits defeat and offers to lead them out of the school through a safe passage, but Kazuaki pulls out a gun and shoots him as the group prepares to escape. Shuu then recalls that Nageki's only relative‚Äîhis adoptive brother‚Äîwas, like Kazuaki, a quail. The terrorist incident occurred at Kazuaki and Nageki's orphanage and left them as the only survivors; witnessing Nageki's subsequent suicide drove Kazuaki insane, leading him to fake his own death, assume a new identity, and join the school's faculty to take revenge against Shuu, the head of Operation Hatoful. Ryouta, channeling Nageki, eases Kazuaki's guilt and convinces him to move on. They reunite with the other characters and exit the school along with the other students and faculty brought there by Mister One; however Ryouta, now thoroughly infected by the Charon virus, elects to stay behind in cryonic storage until a cure is found. The scenario ends with Sakuya vowing to come back for Ryouta, and Ryouta offering to recap the day's events to the protagonist's spirit, within the remnants of Labor 9, as the door to the storage facility closes. If the extended epilogue is unlocked, it is revealed that Yuuya survived being poisoned long enough to receive an antidote, and the game's closing lines imply that with Shuu's cooperation, a cure for the Charon virus has been developed.  Development  Hatoful Boyfriend is the first game developed by manga artist and writer Hato Moa‚Äîauthor of the series Vairocana and a former Dengeki Comic Grand Prix honoree‚Äîunder her d≈çjin circle PigeoNation Inc. As she had no experience with game development prior to Hatoful, Hato initially wanted to start with a visual novel, as she believed it was an easier game type for amateur developers to make; the format also allowed visuals to easily accompany her stories, something that she, as a manga artist, was accustomed to and viewed as being necessary in her work. She first came up with the concept for Hatoful as a 2011 April Fools' Day joke: despite her lack of familiarity with the genre, she initially intended to create a parody of otome game stereotypes. Birds in particular were used as a theme due to Hato's fondness for pigeons; however, this was also partially due to Hato's prioritization of writing over illustrating, as the use of bird photographs instead of hand-drawn sprites allowed her more freedom to focus on the script. The first incarnation of the game was created over the course of half a day and posted as a browser game made with Adobe Flash; but due to strong word of mouth from social media it was taken down after immense traffic caused the web server it was hosted on to crash on two separate occasions. Following the unexpected popularity of the Flash game, development began on a longer visual novel using the FamousWriter game engine. Most of the technical aspects of development‚Äîgame direction, scripting, and programming‚Äîwere handled by Hato alone, with fellow artist Damurushi assisting with some minor aspects of the script and art direction. Despite this, most of the roughly seven-month period Hato spent developing Hatoful from a one-off April Fools' gag to the finished product was dedicated to the construction of the narrative. Hato's approach towards the game's writing was \\"to create something that seems ridiculous and crazy at first glance, but that once you look into the world, you would fall into the depth\\"; however, resolving the darker elements of the plot, particularly the Bad Boys Love scenario, with facts established in the quickly conceived and largely comedic pilot proved to be difficult for her, with inconsistencies in the overall timeline becoming a major concern. During the writing process, Hato admitted that she was critical of the scenarios she had written and constantly doubted whether the final product \\"turned out well\\", later remarking in a postscript written for the game's official guidebook: Kobe Animal Kingdom, a source of birds photographed for sprites used in Hatoful Boyfriend Most of the background images and photography used for the characters' sprites in the original games and associated media are taken from royalty-free sources or fan submissions, though in some cases pictures of birds and backgrounds used are Hato's own artwork or photography‚Äîthe character San Oko is depicted by and based on her real life pet bird Okosan, and several of the sprites featured in Hatoful Boyfriend were derived from pictures she had taken of birds kept at the Kobe Animal Kingdom or the Torimi Caf√©, also located in Kobe. All of the music tracks and sound effects used in Hatoful are also similarly taken from royalty-free sources.  Naming and allusions  The Birds. The title of the game is a multi-layered pun; the wasei-eigo word means \\"heartful\\", however it is also phonetically identical to the Japanese pronunciation of the English word \\"hurtful\\". This is referenced in an alternate name for the Bad Boys Love route, Hurtful Boyfriend, as well as in the subtitle for the full release of the original game, Hatoful Boyfriend: Hurtful Complete Edition. Additionally, the official English transliteration of the title also incorporates the Japanese word , which means \\"pigeon\\" or \\"dove,\\" and is also one of the names of the game's creator, Hato Moa. Similarly, the names of several characters are puns on the Japanese names of their respective species of bird: for example, Ryouta Kawara is a rock dove, or ; Nageki Fujishiro is a mourning dove, or ; Shuu Iwamine is a chukar partridge, or ; and Kazuaki Nanaki is a button quail, or ‚Äîthe character being present in his last name, . Several locations and personalities featured in the game directly correspond to real life venues and people‚Äîfor example, blogger Brian Pigeon is mentioned as one of the Hatoful world's most influential writers. Likewise, some aspects of Hatofuls narrative reference real world events, media, or people: the deadly H5N1 pandemic forming the basis of the game's post-apocalyptic setting was inspired by historical outbreaks of disease, most prominently the 1918 flu pandemic; depictions of Hitchcock's Winter, the in-universe war between humans and birds, bear several similarities to Alfred Hitchcock's film The Birds; and Operation Carneades‚Äîthe codename given to the human countermeasure against H5N1 that instead granted intelligence to birds in the Hatoful universe‚Äîwas named after Greek philosopher Carneades and one of his thought experiments, the Plank of Carneades.  Release history  Hatoful Boyfriend first release in its current visual novel format was a freeware demo released as a downloadable application on 31 July 2011. The demo version contains basic routes for seven of the love interests, and also functions as a benchmark for players to assess if the full game will run on their computer before purchasing it. The first commercial variant of the game, Hatoful Boyfriend: Plus, introducing Anghel as a love interest, was released on 14 August 2011. Plus, a precursor of the full game used as a debugging site for new content and additional scenes intended for the final release, was discontinued on 28 October 2011 when it was patched with the finalized full version. The completed full game itself, Hatoful Boyfriend: Hurtful Complete Edition, was released at COMITIA 98 on 30 October 2011, and includes all content in previous versions of the game as well as the Torimi Caf√© and Bad Boys Love scenarios. In Japan, Plus and Hurtful Complete Edition were initially available only as physical CD-ROMs; a downloadable version of the full game in Japanese was eventually released three years later on 13 April 2014, where the Hurtful Complete Edition was renamed to simply Full version. Due to limitations of the FamousWriter game engine, the demo, Plus, and Hurtful Complete Edition versions of Hatoful Boyfriend are only supported on computers running Windows XP or OS X 10.1-10.5, but are playable‚Äîthough unsupported‚Äîon computers running Windows Vista, Windows 7, or OS X 10.6 with Rosetta. = 2014 remake = Plans to remake the original game in high-definition first began to form when Ed Fear, a writer and creative producer at game developer Mediatonic, contacted Hato Moa about the possibility of translating any projects she was involved in to English. According to the remake's creative director Jeff Tanton, the decision was made to remake the game following several e-mail conversations between Fear and Hato, with Fear's positive experience with the Japanese version of the game and the incompatibility of FamousWriter-made games with newer operating systems‚Äîwhich had rendered the original game effectively unplayable on newer PCs‚Äîbeing major factors in the decision. An international remake of Hatoful developed by Mediatonic and published by Devolver Digital made using the Unity game engine‚Äîallowing the game to be fully compatible with computers that run Windows Vista, Windows 7 or OS X 10.6, and playable for the first time on those that run Linux or OS X 10.7 or newer‚Äîwas first revealed to be in development on 6 June 2014, with a formal announcement coming shortly afterwards at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014. The remake, known as Hatoful Boyfriend HD in Japan, was originally slated for release via Steam on 21 August 2014; however release was later postponed to 4 September 2014 to allow for final adjustments to the Japanese version. The remake includes a new route for Azami, full screen capability, and redrawn backgrounds. A collector's edition of the remake titled Hatoful Boyfriend Summer of Dove Collector's Edition was released for pre-order along with the normal edition, and bundles together the remake, the original Hatoful Boyfriend: Hurtful Complete Edition, a digital version of the game's soundtrack, a new comic illustrated by Hato, exclusive wallpapers of Okosan, and a St. PigeoNation's Class of 2014 yearbook. The remake was also included in the Humble Bundle pack for Valentine's Day 2015, which exclusively featured dating sim games, along with a Hatoful Boyfriend pillowcase for the highest price point option. A port of the remake for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita was released on 21 July 2015. And one to for iOS on 25 May 2016.  English localization  On 22 November 2011, freelance translator Nazerine released a fan translation patch of the free demo version of the game. The initial project involved Nazerine translating, writing, and revising the game text, while another person hacked the game so that the translated text displayed properly on the game screen. This English patch launched the first wave of western interest in the game, with several video game publications reporting on it due to the game's unusual concept. The success of this translation attracted the attention of Hato Moa herself, who then offered Nazerine the opportunity to translate the full game‚Äîand later its sequel, Holiday Star‚Äîfor an official English release. The translation process of the full game was also a solo effort by Nazerine; however, Hato removed the need for hacking by directly supervising the translation, adjusting images in the game for English sentences. As the demo's English patch was made before Nazerine had access to the full version of the game, several lines of dialogue were translated differently to reflect context revealed in Bad Boys Love; for example, third-person pronouns from Kazuaki Nanaki's route implying that he had a female lover in the fan translation were replaced with gender-neutral ones in the official translation. Few dramatic changes were made, though several jokes were added in Nazerine's translations of the game that were not present in the original Japanese text. The official English version of the game was released for download on 15 February 2012. The 2014 remake has also been confirmed to have used Nazerine's translation.  Adaptations = Books and publications  Several official d≈çjin works and supplemental materials illustrated by Hato Moa and Damurushi have been released alongside the games. An official guidebook with extra information regarding the game's setting and characters was released at 29 December 2011 at Comiket 81. The second edition of the guidebook, re-branded as a \\"fanbook\\" (), and Absolute ZERO, an anthology about the fantasy universe perceived by Anghel Higure, were both released on 11 August 2012 at Comiket 82; an English version of Absolute ZERO was later released for Amazon Kindle on 27 August 2014. , featuring an alternate universe retelling of events discussed in Holiday Star, was released in Japanese at COMIC CITY SPARK 7 on 7 October 2012, and on 23 December 2013 for Kindle in English. , an anthology featuring the Hawk Party researchers, was released in Japanese at Comiket 84 on 12 August 2013, and on 29 May 2014 for Kindle in English. , a side story featuring the Kobe Animal Kingdom and written as part of a fundraising event for the venue, was released on 1 February 2014. , a collection of haiku poems written from the perspective of the original Kazuaki Nanaki, was released on 15 August 2014 at Comiket 86.  Webcomic  A webcomic based on the series, written and illustrated by Hato Moa, was serialized in publisher Takeshobo's webcomic anthology Manga Life WIN+ from 8 June 2012 until the anthology's discontinuation, containing sixteen chapters. Each chapter is composed of several four-panel comic strips, followed by a short story in which the characters are depicted in their human forms. The first twelve chapters have since been collected in one tank≈çbon volume (), which was released on 10 August 2013. The volume also contains a feature where the series' characters answered questions sent in by fans. A subsequent d≈çjin anthology containing chapters thirteen to sixteen plus a bonus ten-page comic, , was released on 30 December 2013 at Comiket 85 in Japanese, and on Kindle in English.  Drama CDs  Four drama CDs by Frontier Works based on the series have been released. The first CD, titled had a preliminary release on 29 December 2011 at Comiket 81, and was released for general distribution on 25 January 2012. The second CD, titled Primal Feather, was released on 25 April 2012, followed by a third CD, titled Summer Vacation, on 10 August 2012 at Comiket 82, which had a general release on 12 September 2012. A fourth CD with a Legumentine's Day theme, titled , was released on 14 February 2013.  Web radio  An internet radio show for the series titled was broadcast from 24 December 2011 to 25 January 2012 on the Animate TV website, with the voice cast from the drama CDs reprising their respective roles. The show was hosted by Shintar≈ç Asanuma, who played Ryouta Kawara in the drama CDs, and Hirofumi Nojima, who played Kazuaki Nanaki. Each episode consisted of four segments: , a normal talk corner, , in which various questions regarding life as birds were answered, , in which lines from the game were read, and , a question and answer corner where the voice actors answered any questions from viewers in- character.  Web series  A trailer for the web series was released in Japanese on 20 October 2013, with an English-language translation of the trailer being released on 23 May 2014. The first episode, titled , was released on 19 May 2014. The series is released in visual novel format on the Adobe AIR platform, and takes place in a different universe than the game series.  Plush production line  On 3 November 2015, Erick Scarecrow of Esc-Toy Ltd. launched an official Kickstarter campaign, together with Hato Moa and Devolver Digital, with a set goal of $25,000 to create a production line of three characters from the Hatoful Boyfriend universe, namely, Shuu, Ryouta and Okosan. During the campaign, all stretch goals were reached, the last ending at $75,000, adding seven more characters to the production line. The campaign ended on 6 December 2015, with a total of $145,015 pledged by 2,514 backers. Another official campaign was launched a year later featuring a second series of characters manufactured as limited edition plush. The $50,000 goal was met by 459 backers whom altogether pledged a total of $54,455 by the campaigns end on 6 December 2016.  Reception  As a d≈çjin soft title, Hatoful Boyfriend was created on a limited budget and had even more limited promotion; however, due to strong word of mouth on Twitter and other social media Hatoful has enjoyed a degree of commercial success, especially considering its minimal production costs‚Äîwith Mado no Mori reporting that the game was a \\"popular title\\" whose physical CD-ROM copies \\"consistently sold out at d≈çjin markets and wherever it became available for purchase\\", and 4Gamer.net noting that the game disk was difficult to purchase due to overwhelming demand. Outside Japan, where it is only available by download, the English release of the game is d≈çjin soft distributor DLsite English's best-selling title with 7,000 separate purchases as of 2014. Hatoful Boyfriend has received generally favorable reception, with reviewers focusing on the surprising depth of the game's writing and storyline. In a weekly game spotlight, Kouichi Kirishima from Mado no Mori recommends the game to \\"not just pigeon-lovers, but anyone who enjoys visual novels\\", remarking that the game is \\"at times surprisingly serious and emotionally involved\\". On the other side of the Pacific, Julian Murdoch comments in a Gamers With Jobs analysis of the game that the scenarios featured in Hatoful are \\"elaborate and multifaceted\\", and that Hato Moa herself \\"isn‚Äôt just a storyteller, she‚Äôs actually a good storyteller\\". Hatoful Boyfriend was also named the best PC game of 2012 by GameCola; Paul Franzen explains the game's inclusion among higher budget and more technically sophisticated titles as being due to the strength of its storytelling and pathos, stating that \\"Hatoful Boyfriend isn't just a weird game about heathen human-animal relationships [...] there‚Äôs an actual, serious, emotional game here, too\\". In an article discussing the E3 announcement of the 2014 remake, Carly Smith for The Escapist remarks that Hatoful Boyfriend is \\"absolutely hilarious\\", but recommends that players \\"start the game for a laugh, but stick with it for a ride you wouldn't have expected by looking at the cover\\". Reviewers also praised the game's varied scenarios and replayability. Dora from Jay Is Games praised the game, saying that \\"with a huge amount of replay value, creativity to burn, and some of the most shocking plot lines you could ever hope to encounter, Hatoful Boyfriend is a fascinating and surprising text adventure well worth checking out\\", though she also observes that \\"the delayed payoff and the abruptness of some of the endings combined with the oddball concept may not appeal to every fan of the visual novel genre\\". Alexa Ray Corriea's Polygon review of the remake gave it an 8 out of 10, concluding that the \\"witty dialogue and absolutely bonkers scenarios are genuinely fun to discover, and the handful of different storylines make repeated playthroughs worthwhile\\". Some critics however expressed concerns over the presence of some repetitive aspects of gameplay‚Äînoted as being especially apparent when attempting multiple playthroughs‚Äîas well as the accessibility of the game's Bad Boys Love scenario to casual players: in his review of the remake for PC Gamer, Julian Murdoch states that \\"I suspect few will have the patience to ride the fast forward button and suss out the romantic proclivities of each cast member to get to the extended ending‚Äîreally a second half‚Äîof the game\\". Much attention was drawn to Hatoful Boyfriends surreal concept in both its native Japan as well as overseas. Mentions of the game's \\"bird romance\\" spread through Japanese social media, leading several news agencies and publications to report on Hatoful and the \\"newness\\" of its premise. As translations began to make the game accessible to an English speaking audience, western media reacted similarly: Alec Meer for Rock, Paper, Shotgun commented on Hatofuls premise, citing it as being \\"reason enough to play it\\"; also for Rock, Paper, Shotgun, Craig Pearson stated that the game \\"could only be better if it was a secret game from Valve and BioWare\\". One of the main spurs to the game's popularity was a playthrough recorded by Angie Gallant on the Quarter to Three forums. In a retrospect, Jeffrey Matulef for Eurogamer remarks that Hatoful Boyfriends \\"outlandish premise caught on and the English speaking world demanded it not be left out of this surreal creation\\", while Robert Fenner of RPGFan compared it favorably to Hiroki Azuma's writings on database consumption, praising the game as a \\"fierce deconstruction as well as a tender celebration of dating sims\\". Several Japanese commentators have also noted the game's overseas success, especially following the E3 announcement of the remake by British developer Mediatonic and American publisher Devolver Digital.  Sequel  A sequel titled , was released in Japan on 29 December 2011, with an official English patch being released a year later on Christmas Day. The game is an episodic followup set around the holiday season and takes place in a separate universe from the first game, in which the events of Bad Boys Love do not occur. The sequel, developed largely alongside the first game, makes reference to and explores several unresolved plot elements brought up in the first game's Bad Boys Love scenario that could not be fully addressed in its main narrative. Unlike the first game, Holiday Star is a mostly linear visual novel rather than an otome game, with more standalone scenarios and fewer branching plotlines. On 4 June 2015, it was announced that Mediatonic, the developer responsible for the 2014 remake of the original game, was also developing a remake of Holiday Star, again to be published by Devolver Digital. The remake of the sequel is slated for release in Winter 2015. On 8 December 2015, it was announced that the remake of Hatoful Boyfriend: Holiday Star would be released on 15 December 2015 for Microsoft Windows, OS X and Linux, and on 22 December 2015 for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita. In 2018, Hato Moa made a blog post announcing the development of a third Hatoful game, titled Hatoful Boyfriend: MIRROR. This game would be set in an alternate universe where most of the main characters are alive, and where the events of the preceding two games did not occur. As of August, 2019, the game was still in development.

Family and childhood Olivier was born in Wilton, of Huguenot stock, her father being Canon of Wilton, and her mother the daughter of a bishop. She was one of ten children.Entry for OLIVIER, Edith, in Stringer, Jenny: Oxford Companion to Twentieth Century Literature, p 510 After receiving schooling at home, Olivier went up to St Hugh's College, Oxford, in 1895, but completed only four terms before leaving because of asthma. She was related to the actor Laurence Olivier through her paternal grandfather, Henry Stephen Olivier, who, through one of his other sons, was the actor's great grandfather. Political and social activity Until his death in 1919 her life was dominated by her father, who was both autocratic and conservative. She was an adherent of the Anglican Church and served on the Women's Diocesan Council. Olivier also undertook activities in the Conservative Party, and Women's Institute. In 1916, at the behest of the Wiltshire county agricultural committee, Olivier helped form the Women's Land Army in Wiltshire, for which she was rewarded in 1920 with an MBE. When she was elected to Wilton Town Council in 1934, she became the first woman to serve on the council, and was later mayor from 1938 to 1941. As mayoress it was her responsibility to house the children and mothers of babies evacuated from London. Southern Command was based at Wilton and every bedroom in her house was occupied by a lodger. She describes this in Night Thoughts of a Country Landlady, humorously illustrated by her close friend, the artist Rex Whistler. Her public service during the Second World War included the presidency of the local St John Ambulance Brigade.  Wilton and Wiltshire  Olivier outside Daye House, painted by Rex Whistler. Born at Wilton Rectory, Edith grew up playing in and worshipping the neighbouring house and gardens of Wilton House. George Lord Pembroke and his wife Gety were childless and encouraged the young Olivier children to spend time with them and to play with their nephews and nieces. When Edith's widower father, Canon Dacres Olivier, retired before the First World War, she and her sister Mildred moved with him to No.20 in Salisbury's Cathedral Close. Her father died the year the war ended, and after a short spell renting at Fitz House, Teffont Magna, the two 40-year-old Olivier sisters moved into the old dairy house (Daye House) on the Wilton estate in 1920. This was at the request of childhood friend Reginald, Lord Pembroke, who had inherited Wilton from his uncle in 1913. Wilton and Wiltshire were her lifelong passions. > ‚ÄúOf all the neighbours on whom I grew to rely more and more, Edith Olivier > was perhaps always the most cherished. So many of the young writers, > painters and poets came to her with problems about their work and their > lives and they knew that after she had listened intently to their > outpourings, her advice would be unprejudiced, wise and Christian.‚Äù ‚Äì Cecil > Beaton In her nightly journal - missed only three times: when her brother Harold was killed fighting in 1914, her sister Mildred died from breast cancer in 1923, and her closest friend Rex Whistler was killed jumping from his tank in 1944 - Edith recorded a way of life and a generation that vanished with the outbreak of the Second World War. She describes the 'Bright Young Things' on the Earl of Pembroke's estate at Wilton and at nearby Ashcombe, Cecil Beaton's house, first discovered by Edith. She writes of her close friendships with neighbours Stephen Tennant and his mother, Pamela, wife of Sir Edward Grey; the poet Sir Henry Newbolt; and painters Henry Lamb and Augustus John. Her book on her beloved Wiltshire in the County Books series was published posthumously by her niece Miss Rosemary Olivier who continued to live at Daye House at the request of the Pembrokes, and became Mayor of Wilton also.  Writing and artistic circle  Rex Whistler's 1939 portrait of Olivier It was after Mildred died in 1923 that she started to engage a broader social circle. It was then that she formed a profound friendship with Rex Whistler and acted as a frequent hostess to an elite, artistic, and social set which included Cecil Beaton, Siegfried Sassoon, William Walton, and Osbert Sitwell. She describes them vividly in her journals: Cecil Beaton: ‚Äòa marble face and voice‚Äô John Betjeman: ‚Äòcleaner than I expected‚Ä¶ loves Georgian churches‚Äô Lady Diana Cooper: ‚ÄòI have never seen anyone else really look what I think Helen of Troy must have looked‚Äô Siegfried Sassoon: ‚Äòsuch fun to tell things to. Laughs so utterly‚Äô Edith Sitwell: ‚Äòbitter against the world in general, and very comprehending towards individuals when she knows about them‚Äô Stephen Tennant: ‚Äòdazzling in his inspired wit and vision‚Äô William Walton: ‚Äòa very domestic man, ready to help in all household emergencies‚Äô Rex Whistler: ‚Äòa reincarnation of Breughel‚Äô Her first novel, The Love Child, was published in 1927, and was followed by further novels, biographies including one of Alexander Cruden, and the autobiographical Without Knowing Mr Walkley. Things Past Explaining In her autobiography Without Knowing Mr Walkley (Walkley was the theatre critic of The Times, and Edith had dreamed of becoming an actress not a writer), she has a chapter called Things Past Explaining. As she says, \\"Inexplicable things do happen to me, although I do not call myself 'psychic' as people say\\".  Mystery Tennis Racket  One midsummer's night at the Daye House she woke to hear something thud onto the floor by her bed. It was an old-fashioned tennis racket. She never solved the mystery of its arrival. The windows and door to her room were closed. There was no-one in the house. ‚ÄòIf it was an apport left by a passing spirit, I can only say that the sense of humour of those in another world is very different from ours.‚Ä≤  Lost City of Lyonesse  Twice, whilst visiting Land's End, she saw a fortified city some miles out in the Atlantic. ‚ÄòIt was a jumble of towers, domes, spires and battlements.‚Äô On the first occasion she thought it must be the Scilly Isles but a passing coastguardsman corrected her and dismissed her as an ‚Äòimbecile.‚Äô She saw the city again when ‚Äòthe atmospheric conditions were completely different.‚Äô That day her driving companion Miss Macpherson also saw it and identified it as the lost city of Lyonesse which she had heard about and always hoped to see. Miss Macpherson felt herself lucky enough to see the city again some years later, but her sister who was with her saw nothing.  Avebury's Beckhampton Avenue  In October 1916, whilst working for the Women's Land Army, Edith stopped at Avebury to watch a fair in the rain. Many years later she discovered that the last fair had been held there sixty-six years earlier. This prompted her to explore exactly where she had seen the primitive swing boats, coconut shys, and shooting range. She learned that the avenue down which she believed she had driven (from the direction of Beckhampton) had disappeared long before the year 1800. However, when the excavator Alexander Keiller began searching for this avenue she did not have the courage to tell him where to start digging.  Misses Moberly and Jourdain  Edith was a published author when she was asked to write the preface to the 1931 fourth edition of the popular An Adventure by Charlotte Anne Moberly (principal of St Hugh's College, Oxford from its foundation in 1886 until 1915) and her successor Eleanor Jourdain. In it the Oxford academics detail with considerable rigour how on a visit to Versailles in 1901 they believed they had found themselves walking in the Trianon of 1789 and seen Marie-Antoinette. Their account was initially published in 1911 under the pseudonyms Miss Morison and Miss Lamont, in a vain attempt to protect their reputations. Jourdain died in 1924 whilst principal, her demise possibly brought on by the criticism she and Moberly received for daring to involve Oxford University in something so unscientific. For the 1931 edition, and to support Moberly, Edith invited the scientist J.W. Dunne to introduce the account with a note concerning his interest in Serialism (and its fourth dimension) and how this might explain what Moberly and Jourdain had seen. And perhaps what occasionally happened to her.  The Bishop's Birds  Edith was familiar with the legend that two white birds would be seen flying over Salisbury Cathedral upon the death of a Bishop of Salisbury. Moberly's father had been Bishop of Salisbury and she had seen two such birds an hour after his death in 1885. She told Edith this when she first arrived at St Hugh's College, having won a scholarship organized by the current Bishop of Salisbury. Edith's friends would have been familiar with these stories of the unexplained and suitably infected by her enthusiasm. David Herbert, second son of Reginald, Earl of Pembroke, recalling her funeral, wrote: ‚ÄòAs they lowered her coffin into the grave, with swish of wings a pigeon flew up into the sky.

It is located at . The NASA Mars Science Laboratory mission landed the Curiosity rover on Aeolis Palus in August 2012. Curiosity spent two (Earth) years exploring the plain as it drove towards Aeolis Mons. The rover left the plain in September 2014 when it reached the mountain's foothills. Spacecraft exploration On August 5, 2012, at 10:32 p.m. PDT/mission time (August 6, 2012 at 5:32 UTC), mission control at JPL received a signal from the NASA Curiosity rover that it had successfully landed in \\"Yellowknife\\" Quad 51 of Aeolis Palus. The rover's mission is to explore the surface area of Gale Crater focusing first near its landing site on Aeolis Palus and then venturing into the nearby foothills of Aeolis Mons (unofficially, \\"Mount Sharp\\") to investigate its geological features and strata. On September 26, 2013, NASA scientists reported the Mars Curiosity rover detected \\"abundant, easily accessible\\" water (1.5 to 3 weight percent) in soil samples at the Rocknest region of Aeolis Palus in Gale Crater. In addition, NASA reported the rover found two principal soil types: a fine-grained mafic type and a locally derived, coarse-grained felsic type. The mafic type, similar to other martian soils and martian dust, was associated with hydration of the amorphous phases of the soil. Also, perchlorates, the presence of which may make detection of life-related organic molecules difficult, were found at the Curiosity rover landing site (and earlier at the more polar site of the Phoenix lander) suggesting a \\"global distribution of these salts\\". NASA also reported that Jake M rock, a rock encountered by Curiosity on the way to Glenelg, was a mugearite and very similar to terrestrial mugearite rocks. On December 9, 2013, NASA reported that, based on evidence from Curiosity studying Aeolis Palus, Gale Crater contained an ancient freshwater lake which could have been a hospitable environment for microbial life. On December 16, 2014, NASA reported detecting, based on measurements by the Curiosity rover, an unusual increase, then decrease, in the amounts of methane in the atmosphere of the planet Mars; in addition, organic chemicals were detected in powder drilled from a rock by the Curiosity rover. Also, based on deuterium to hydrogen ratio studies, much of the water at Gale Crater on Mars was found to have been lost during ancient times, before the lakebed in the crater was formed; afterwards, large amounts of water continued to be lost.  Bradbury Landing \\"Bradbury Landing\\" is a named location on Aeolis Palus. It is where the Curiosity rover landed. The coordinates of the landing site are: . The landing site location was named for science fiction author Ray Bradbury. NASA announced the name on Bradbury's 92nd birthday, August 22, in honor of the author who died a few months earlier on June 5, 2012. Michael Meyer, NASA program scientist for Curiosity, said \\"This was not a difficult choice for the science team. Many of us and millions of other readers were inspired in our lives by stories Ray Bradbury wrote to dream of the possibility of life on Mars.\\" Bradbury wrote a collection of stories called The Martian Chronicles in the 1940s.

The sepulchre was built for Tin Hinan, the Tuareg ancient Queen of the Hoggar (Ahaggar). History=Origin The tomb's entrance, located in the Bardo National Museum. Tin Hinan is the name given by the Tuareg to a 3rd- or 4th-century woman of prestige whose skeleton was found in a pre-Islamic tomb in the Ahaggar Mountains. Tin Hinan is sometimes referred to as \\"Queen of the Hoggar\\", and by the Tuareg as Tamenokalt which also means \\"queen\\". The name literally means \\"woman of the tents\\", but is sometime translated as \\"Queen of the camp\\" (with the \\"camp\\" possibly referring to the group of tombs which surround hers)Camps, Gabriel. L'√¢ge du Tombeau de Tin Hinan, anc√™tre des Touareg du Hoggar, \\"Zephyrus\\" 25 (1974), pp. 497‚Äì516. or more metaphorically as \\"Mother of us all\\". The French explorer Henri Lhote argued that the Tin Hinan sepulcher is different from the surrounding tombs in southern Algeria, and is more typical of the architecture used by the Roman legionaries to create their fortifications in desert areas. He believed that the tomb was therefore likely built on top of an earlier Roman castrum, which was originally erected around 19 BC, when consul Lucius Cornelius Balbus conquered the Garamantian territories and sent a small expeditionary force to reach the Niger river. However, this hypothesis is rejected by most scholars today. Excavation The tomb was opened by Byron Khun de Prorok with support from the French army in 1925, and other archaeologists made a more thorough investigation in 1933. It was found to contain the skeleton of a woman on a wooden litter, lying on her back with her head facing east. She was accompanied by heavy gold and silver jewellery, some of it adorned with pearls. On her right forearm she wore 7 silver bracelets, and on her left, 7 gold bracelets. Another silver bracelet and a gold ring were placed with the body. Remains of a complex piecework necklace of gold and pearls (real and artificial) were also present. Furthermore, a number of funerary objects were also found. These included a \\"Venus\\" statue in Aurignacian style (similar to the Venus of Hohle Fels), a glass goblet (lost during World War II), and gold foil which bore the imprint of a Roman coin of emperor Constantine I issued between 308 and 324 AD. A fourth century date is consistent with radiocarbon dating of the wooden bed, as well as with the style of pottery and other tomb furniture. The monument itself is constructed in an architectural style that was widespread in the Berber Sahara during classical times. In the 1960s, the anthropologist E. Leblanc examined the skeleton within the Tin Hinan tomb. He observed that the remains were tall and lithe, with a narrow pelvis, broad shoulders and slender legs. Overall, the skeleton closely resembled those found in the pharaonic monuments of ancient Egypt. The body found in the tomb is now in the Bardo Museum in Algiers.  In popular culture  The Tomb of Tin Hinan is mentioned in the video game Amnesia: The Dark Descent. According to documents found scattered throughout the game, the tomb supposedly contained two mythical orbs, which are important to the game's story. NotesBibliography * Beltrami, Vanni.

It is a selective-fire weapon for short-range street and brush fighting. It remains reasonably accurate up to 100 m using sighted semi-automatic fire. For close range combat, 2- or 3-shot bursts are recommended. Overview The Parinco mod. 3R submachine gun is blowback-operated firing from an open bolt. Design and influence The Mod. 3R is a simple blowback design and was made out of stamped sheet metal and a plastic grip frame. It uses the standard 9√ó19mm NATO round out of a 32-shot box single-column magazine. Army doctrine recommends to shortload the magazine to 28 rounds to prevent failures. A loading tool is used to assist loading the magazine. The gun was designed with a 280 mm long barrel which featured a compensator and cooling fins. Empty casings are ejected out of the ejection port on the right, which has a hinged dust cover. This cover opens automatically when cocking the gun. The bolt handle is on the left side and is non-reciprocating. The stock is heavy steel wire and it telescopes along the receiver; one end is slotted for swabs and the other is threaded for a cleaning brush. The sights are fixed and set for a range of 50 m. The pistol grip contains a grip safety which must be held before the weapon can be cocked or fired. There are three selector positions: safe, semi-automatic and full automatic fire. When set to full-auto; it is still possible to squeeze off single rounds with good trigger control. Influence by some popular World War II-era designs is apparent. The barrel compensator and cooling rings are reminiscent of the Thompson submachine gun, the stock looks like the M3 submachine gun but modified to handle recoil, the bolt design is nearly identical to the Sten.

It is a type of quasi-entropy defined for the Husimi Q representation of the phase-space quasiprobability distribution. See for a comprehensive review of basic properties of classical, quantum and Wehrl entropies, and their implications in statistical mechanics.  Definitions  The Husimi function is a \\"classical phase-space\\" function of position and momentum , and in one dimension is defined for any quantum-mechanical density matrix by :Q_\\\\rho(x,p)=\\\\int \\\\phi(x,p  y)^* \\\\rho (y, y')\\\\phi (x,py')dy dy', where is a \\"(Glauber) coherent state\\", given by :\\\\phi(x,py)=\\\\pi^{-1/4}\\\\exp(-y-x^2/2)+i\\\\, px). (It can be understood as the Weierstrass transform of the Wigner quasi-probability distribution.) The Wehrl entropy is then defined as : S_W(\\\\rho) = -\\\\int Q_\\\\rho(x,p) \\\\log Q_\\\\rho(x,p) \\\\, dx \\\\, dp ~. The definition can be easily generalized to any finite dimension.  Properties  Such a definition of the entropy relies on the fact that the Husimi Q representation remains non-negative definite, unlike other representations of quantum quasiprobability distributions in phase space. The Wehrl entropy has several important properties: # It is always positive, S_W(\\\\rho)\\\\geq 0, like the full quantum von Neumann entropy, but unlike the classical differential entropy which can be negative at low temperature. In fact, the minimum value of the Wehrl entropy is 1, i.e. S_W(\\\\rho)\\\\geq 1, as discussed below in the section \\"Werhl's conjecture\\". # The entropy for the tensor product of two systems is always greater than the entropy of one system. In other words, for a state \\\\rho on a Hilbert space \\\\mathcal{H}=\\\\mathcal{H}_1\\\\otimes\\\\mathcal{H}_2, we have S_W(\\\\rho_1)\\\\leq S_W(\\\\rho), where \\\\rho_1=\\\\mathrm{Tr}_2\\\\, \\\\rho. Note that the quantum von Neumann entropy, S(\\\\rho), does not have this property, as can be clearly seen for a pure maximally entangled state. # The Wehrl entropy is strictly lower bounded by a von Neumann entropy, S_W(\\\\rho) > S(\\\\rho). There is no known upper or lower bound (other than zero) for the difference S_W(\\\\rho)-S(\\\\rho). # The Wehrl entropy is not invariant under all unitary transformations, unlike the von Neumann entropy. In other words, S_W(U^* \\\\rho \\\\,U) eq S_W(\\\\rho) for a general unitary . It is, however, invariant under certain unitary transformations.  Wehrl's conjecture  In his original paper Wehrl posted a conjecture that the smallest possible value of Wehrl entropy is 1, S_W(\\\\rho)\\\\geq 1, and it occurs if and only if the density matrix \\\\rho is a pure state projector onto any coherent state, i.e. for all choices of x_0, p_0, :\\\\rho_0(y, y')=\\\\phi(x_0,p_0y)^*\\\\phi(x_0,p_0y'). Soon after the conjecture was posted, E. H. Lieb proved that the minimum of the Wehrl entropy is 1, and it occurs when the state is a projector onto any coherent state. In 1991 E. Carlen proved the uniqueness of the minimizer, i.e. the minimum of the Wehrl entropy occurs only when the state is a projector onto any coherent state. The analog of the Wehrl conjecture for systems with a classical phase space isomorphic to the sphere (rather than the plane) is the Lieb conjecture.  Discussion  However, it is not the fully quantum von Neumann entropy in the Husimi representation in phase space, : all the requisite star-products ‚òÖ in that entropy have been dropped here. In the Husimi representation, the star products read : \\\\star \\\\equiv \\\\exp\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{2} ({\\\\stackrel{\\\\leftarrow}{\\\\partial}}_x -i {\\\\stackrel{\\\\leftarrow}{\\\\partial}}_p) ({\\\\stackrel{\\\\rightarrow}{\\\\partial}}_x + i{\\\\stackrel{\\\\rightarrow}{\\\\partial}}_p ) \\\\right)~, and are isomorphicC. Zachos, D. Fairlie, and T. Curtright, ‚ÄúQuantum Mechanics in Phase Space‚Äù (World Scientific, Singapore, 2005) . to the Moyal products of the Wigner‚ÄìWeyl representation. The Wehrl entropy, then, may be thought of as a type of heuristic semiclassical approximation to the full quantum von Neumann entropy, since it retains some dependence (through Q) but not all of it. Like all entropies, it reflects some measure of non-localization, as the Gauss transform involved in generating and the sacrifice of the star operators have effectively discarded information. In general, as indicated, for the same state, the Wehrl entropy exceeds the von Neumann entropy (which vanishes for pure states).  Wehrl entropy for Bloch coherent states  Wehrl entropy can be defined for other kinds of coherent states. For example, it can be defined for Bloch coherent states, that is, for angular momentum representations of the group SU(2) for quantum spin systems.  Bloch coherent states  Consider a space \\\\mathbb{C}^{2J+1} with J=\\\\frac{1}{2}, 1, \\\\frac{3}{2}, \\\\dots . We consider a single quantum spin of fixed angular momentum , and shall denote by \\\\mathbf{S}=(S_x, S_y, S_z) the usual angular momentum operators that satisfy the following commutation relations: [S_x, S_y]=i \\\\,S_z and cyclic permutations. Define S_\\\\pm=S_x\\\\pm i\\\\, S_y, then [S_z, S_\\\\pm]=\\\\pm S_\\\\pm and [S_+, S_-]=S_z. The eigenstates of S_z are :S_zs\\\\rangle=ss\\\\rangle, s=-J,\\\\dots, J. For s=J the state J\\\\rangle\\\\in \\\\mathbb{C}^{2J+1} satisfies: S_zJ\\\\rangle=JJ\\\\rangle, and S_+J\\\\rangle=0, S_-J\\\\rangle=J-1\\\\rangle. Denote the unit sphere in three dimensions by :\\\\Xi_2=\\\\\\\\{\\\\Omega=(\\\\theta, \\\\phi)\\\\  \\\\ 0\\\\leq \\\\theta \\\\leq \\\\pi,\\\\ 0\\\\leq \\\\phi\\\\leq 2\\\\pi\\\\\\\\}, and by L^2(\\\\Xi) the space of square integrable function on with the measure :d\\\\Omega=\\\\frac{2J+1}{4\\\\pi}\\\\sin\\\\theta\\\\, d\\\\theta\\\\, d\\\\phi. The Bloch coherent state is defined by :\\\\Omega\\\\rangle\\\\equiv \\\\exp\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\theta e^{i\\\\phi}S_--\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\theta e^{-i\\\\phi}S_+\\\\right\\\\\\\\}J\\\\rangle. Taking into account the above properties of the state J\\\\rangle, the Bloch coherent state can also be expressed as :\\\\Omega\\\\rangle=(1+z^2)^{-J}e^{z S_-}J\\\\rangle=(1+z^2)^{-J}\\\\sum_{M=-J}^J z^{J-M}\\\\binom{2J}{J+M}^{1/2}M\\\\rangle, where ~~z=e^{i\\\\phi}\\\\tan \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}, and :M\\\\rangle=\\\\binom{2J}{J+M}^{-1/2}\\\\frac{1}{(J-M)!}\\\\, S_-^{J-M}J\\\\rangle is a normalised eigenstate of S_z satisfying S_zM\\\\rangle=MM\\\\rangle. The Bloch coherent state is an eigenstate of the rotated angular momentum operator S_z with a maximum eigenvalue. In other words, for a rotation operator :R_{\\\\theta,\\\\phi}=\\\\exp\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\theta e^{i\\\\phi} S_--\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\theta e^{-i\\\\phi} S_+ \\\\right\\\\\\\\}, the Bloch coherent state \\\\Omega\\\\rangle satisfies :R_{\\\\theta, \\\\phi} S_z R^{-1}_{\\\\theta, \\\\phi} \\\\ \\\\Omega\\\\rangle=J\\\\,\\\\Omega\\\\rangle.  Wehrl entropy for Bloch coherent states  Given a density matrix , define the semi-classical density distribution :\\\\rho^{cl}(\\\\Omega)=\\\\langle \\\\Omega \\\\rho \\\\Omega \\\\rangle. The Wehrl entropy of \\\\rho for Bloch coherent states is defined as a classical entropy of the density distribution \\\\rho^{cl}, :S_W^B(\\\\rho)=S^{cl}(\\\\rho^{cl})=-\\\\int \\\\rho^{cl}(\\\\Omega)\\\\ \\\\ln \\\\rho^{cl}(\\\\Omega)\\\\ d\\\\Omega, where S^{cl} is a classical differential entropy.  Wehrl's conjecture for Bloch coherent states  The analogue of the Wehrl's conjecture for Bloch coherent states was proposed in in 1978. It suggests the minimum value of the Werhl entropy for Bloch coherent states, :S_W^B(\\\\rho)\\\\geq \\\\frac{2J}{2J+1}, and states that the minimum is reached if and only if the state is a pure Bloch coherent state. In 2012 E. H. Lieb and J. P. Solovej proved a substantial part of this conjecture, confirming the minimum value of the Wehrl entropy for Bloch coherent states, and the fact that it is reached for any pure Bloch coherent state. The problem of the uniqueness of the minimizer remains unresolved.  Generalized Wehrl's conjecture  In E. H. Lieb and J. P. Solovej proved Wehrl's conjecture for Bloch coherent states by generalizing it in the following manner.  Generalized Wehrl's conjecture  For any concave function f: [0,1]\\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R} (e.g. f(x)=-x\\\\log x as in the definition of the Wehrl entropy), and any density matrix , we have :\\\\int f(Q_\\\\rho(x,p))dx\\\\, dp \\\\geq \\\\int f(Q_{\\\\rho_0}(x,p))dx\\\\, dp, where 0 is a pure coherent state defined in the section \\"Wehrl conjecture\\".  Generalized Wehrl's conjecture for Bloch coherent states  Generalized Wehrl's conjecture for Glauber coherent states was proved as a consequence of the similar statement for Bloch coherent states. For any concave function f: [0,1]\\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R}, and any density matrix we have :\\\\int f(\\\\langle \\\\Omega\\\\rho\\\\Omega\\\\rangle)d\\\\Omega \\\\geq \\\\int f(\\\\langle \\\\Omega\\\\Omega_0\\\\rangle^2)d\\\\Omega, where \\\\Omega_0\\\\in\\\\Xi_2 is any point on a sphere. The uniqueness of the minimizers for either statement remains an open problem.

It first appeared in book form in the short-story collection And Four to Go, published by the Viking Press in 1958. Plot summary \\"The Labor Union Murder\\" appeared in Look magazine (July 9, 1957) with photo- illustrations by Arthur Rothstein A restaurant workers' union is having a Fourth of July picnic in a remote meadow on Long Island. Time has been set aside during the afternoon for a few speeches from prominent figures in the restaurant business, and also one from Nero Wolfe. Wolfe has been the trustee for Rusterman's Restaurant since the death of his old friend Marko Vukcic, and because the restaurant is so highly regarded the union wants Wolfe to speak. As an added inducement, the union has also promised to stop trying to get Fritz, Wolfe's personal chef, to join. Wolfe and Archie arrive at the meadow and work their way through a tent to a raised platform from which the speakers will address the thousands of union members. One of the organizers, Phil Holt, has eaten some bad snails and is lying in misery on a cot in the tent. He has been seen by a doctor but is too weak to participate in the festivities. He is shivering and Wolfe tells Archie to tie the tent flap closed, to help stop the draft blowing through. One by one, as the scheduled speakers address the throng, those on the speakers' platform go back into the tent to see to Holt. Eventually Wolfe goes to check on Holt and shortly calls to Archie to join him. Holt is dead, lying on the cot, covered by a blanket that conceals the knife in his back. It is Wolfe's habit, when he is away from home and confronted by a murder, to tell Archie to take him back to the brownstone immediately, before the police arrive. It is Archie's habit to refuse and he does so now, pointing out that they would simply be hauled back to Long Island. Wolfe concedes the point and returns to the platform to deliver his speech. Archie has noticed that the tent flap is no longer tied shut. He glances out the back of the tent and sees a woman sitting in a car parked by the tent. Archie gets her name, Anna Banau, and asks her if she has seen anyone enter the tent since the speeches started. Mrs. Banau says that she has not. Archie is impressed by her calm certainty, and concludes that no one entered the tent from the back. Someone must have gone in from the platform, stabbed Holt, and then opened the rear flap to make it appear as though the killer came from that direction, not from the platform. The body is soon discovered and the police are called. It's clear that the local District Attorney would love to hold Wolfe and Archie as material witnesses, but he can't find a legitimate reason, so Wolfe returns home after all. The next day, though, Mr. Banau comes calling. He knows of his wife's discussion with Archie on the prior afternoon, and cannot understand why the papers report that the police are proceeding on the assumption that the murderer entered the tent from the rear. His wife saw no one enter the tent from that side, and that is what she told Archie ‚Äì surely Archie passed that along to the police. When Wolfe tells Banau that Mrs. Banau's information was not passed along, Banau becomes upset and leaves the brownstone, stating that he must tell the police. Wolfe sees that he and Archie will be arrested and must make their getaway. They head for Saul Panzer's apartment, where they have arranged to meet with the others who were on the speakers' platform. Wolfe as yet has no idea who the murderer is, nor the motive for the crime. But when the principal suspects arrive at Saul's, Wolfe finds it important that he and Archie share autobiographical sketches with them. Then he bluffs the murderer into identifying himself.

Stout subsequently rewrote and expanded the story as \\"Frame-Up for Murder\\", serialized in three issues of The Saturday Evening Post (June 21‚ÄìJuly 5, 1958). It is the only time Stout rewrote and expanded a story for a magazine. \\"Frame-Up for Murder\\" was collected for the first time in book form in the Bantam Books short-story collection, Death Times Three (1985). Plot summary Nero Wolfe returned to The Saturday Evening Post on June 21, 1958, with \\"Frame-Up for Murder\\", Rex Stout's expanded rewrite of \\"Murder Is No Joke\\" Alec Gallant was a member of the French Resistance during World War II and at that time married another member, Bianca. After the war, he learned that his wife and her two brothers had been traitors to the Resistance. He murdered both men, but Bianca escaped him. Gallant came to the United States in 1945 and rejoined his sister Flora, who had immigrated from France several years earlier. Gallant became a highly regarded couturier (as Wolfe later terms him, \\"an illustrious dressmaker\\") with a studio employing several staff, including Flora. A successful Broadway actress, Sarah Yare, is a valued customer, one who is well liked by all of Gallant's employees. Into this happy mix comes Bianca. She has changed her surname to Voss and insinuated herself into Gallant's operation, making decisions about company strategy, apparently with Gallant's approval. Gallant has kept information about his past with Bianca to himself, hiding it not only from the staff but also from his sister, Flora. Everyone at Alec Gallant Incorporated is mystified that Gallant is putting up with Bianca's odd and counterproductive decisions, particularly because she seems to have no formal title or position at the company. Fearing for her brother's career, Flora calls at Nero Wolfe's office and asks him to investigate the situation. She has only $100 to pay Wolfe's fee, but she says that her brother would be grateful to be rid of Miss Voss, and he is a generous man. Wolfe points out, though, that it's not Mr. Gallant who would be hiring him. Flora suggests that they phone Bianca, and invite her to Wolfe's office where he can ask questions of her, and then, \\"We shall see.\\" In reporting this exchange, Archie Goodwin claims that it is Flora's choice of phrasing, instead of an informal \\"We'll see\\" or \\"We will see,\\" that moves Wolfe to acquiesce. Flora uses Archie's phone to call Miss Voss, and gives Archie the handset as Wolfe picks up his own phone. After identifying himself to Miss Voss, Wolfe becomes the target of a string of insults hurled by Miss Voss ‚Äì \\"You are scum, I know, in your stinking sewer.\\" ‚Äì and then both Wolfe and Archie hear a thud, a groan, a crash, and a dead phone line. Archie calls Gallant's offices back, and asks for Miss Voss. Archie and Wolfe learn that Miss Voss has just been found dead in her office. When they inform Flora, she seems stunned, and hurries from the office. Later, discussing the situation with Inspector Cramer, Wolfe agrees it's very neat that Wolfe and Archie were on the phone with Miss Voss just as she was being assaulted, and thus can fix the time of the attack within a minute or two. That makes it difficult, because everyone at Gallant's studio has a strong alibi for that time. The next day, Archie is summoned to the District Attorney's office to go over his statement once again. When he returns to the brownstone, he is astonished to see that Wolfe has exerted himself to the point of getting the phone book from Archie's desk and taking it to his own. Wolfe has no explanation of the phone book for Archie, but he does have instructions.

To create the actual product, the creators worked with drink development company Pro-Liquitech International. As part of bringing the product to market, Rhythm was entered into a number of competitions. The first version of Rhythm business plan won a University of Louisville internal business plan competition, which qualified it to regional, national and eventually the international Moot Corp Global Business Plan Competition where Rhythm finished 11th out of 35 entries.  Distribution and marketing  Until 2013, Rhythm was distributed for sale in the United States, Germany and the United Kingdom. As part of its marketing strategy, Rhythm was featured in a number of music videos by well-known artists, including Lil Jon and DJ Khaled. In 2009, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration began its investigation into the safety of caffeinated alcoholic beverages, and in late 2010, the first two states, Michigan and Washington, issued a ban on caffeinated alcoholic beverages.

The film is based on the 1846 novella The Double by Fyodor Dostoyevsky. It is about a man driven to breakdown when he is usurped by a doppelg√§nger. The film was produced by Alcove Entertainment, with Michael Caine, Graeme Cox (Attercop), Tessa Ross (Film4) and Nigel Williams as executive producers. Plot Downtrodden Simon James (Jesse Eisenberg) has worked at his office for seven years, but he is ignored by his boss and colleagues. From his apartment he spies on a beautiful co-worker he admires, Hannah (Mia Wasikowska), who lives in the apartment opposite him. He sees her throwing away art and secretly retrieves and admires it. One night, Simon sees a man jump to his death from the floor above Hannah's apartment. He talks to detectives, who explain that if the man had jumped a few feet to the right, he would have been badly hurt but would have survived. Simon's boss (Wallace Shawn) announces the arrival of a new employee, James Simon (also played by Eisenberg), who looks identical to Simon, which causes Simon to faint upon first glance. Assertive and charming, James is Simon's polar opposite. Much to Simon's annoyance, James not only gets respect from their co-workers but no one seems to notice that they are identical in appearance. James, on the other hand, does notice this and sees Simon's pain. Out of pity, he decides to buddy-up with Simon and give him advice about how to seduce Hannah. Hannah then asks James on a date through Simon. On the date, Simon pretends to be James, with the real James giving him instructions via earpiece. When Simon becomes nervous, the two swap places and James kisses Hannah, angering Simon. James asks Simon to take an aptitude test in his place and seduces their boss's surly, rebellious daughter, Melanie (Yasmin Paige), whom Simon was reluctantly hired to tutor. Simon gets his revenge on James by revealing to Hannah that James is cheating on her with Melanie. Furious, James blackmails Simon for his apartment keys using explicit photos he took of himself with Melanie, knowing their boss will believe it is Simon in the photos. At work, Simon accuses James of being an imposter and is fired after going on a maniacal tirade. As he is about to kill himself, he sees Hannah lying unconscious in her apartment. He calls an ambulance and accompanies her to the hospital, where it is revealed that she not only overdosed but also miscarried (she had become pregnant after a sexual encounter with James). Simon then takes Hannah back home, relieved that she has survived. Still upset, however, Hannah states that she wanted to die and she suggests that Simon kill himself. She goes through Simon's jacket pockets and discovers earrings he had bought for her and her salvaged art. Simon learns his mother has died and finds James at her funeral. Simon punches him and discovers that they share injuries; as James's nose bleeds, so does Simon's. He finds Hannah and tells her he wants to be noticed. He goes to his apartment and handcuffs the sleeping James to his bed, then goes to the ledge above Hannah's apartment, steps to the right, and jumps. He is badly hurt. Hannah runs to him and an ambulance arrives. Lacking medical attention, the handcuffed James appears to be on the brink of death as he lies motionless on the apartment floor. Inside the ambulance, The Colonel (James Fox) and Hannah watch over Simon. The Colonel tells Simon that he is \\"special\\", to which the latter responds with a half-smile, \\"I'd like to think I'm pretty unique\\".

Principal photography began on 20 May 2012 in London. Soundtrack The score by Andrew Hewitt features a recurring progression of heavy chords played by strings. The chord progression comes from the song \\"Der Doppelg√§nger\\" by Franz Schubert. Release The Double premiered at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival on 7 September 2013. On 15 October 2013 it was announced that Magnolia Pictures had acquired the US rights to the film for a 2014 release. Box office The film opened in two cinemas in the United States and grossed $14,646. It ended up grossing $145,511 in North America and $1,306,588 internationally for a total of $1,452,099. Critical reception The film received positive reviews from critics and has a \\"Certified Fresh\\" rating of 83% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 131 reviews, with an average rating of 6.9/10. The consensus states \\"Hauntingly bleak and thrillingly ambitious, The Double offers Jesse Eisenberg a pair of compelling roles while reaffirming writer- director Richard Ayoade's remarkable talent.\\" The film also has a score of 68 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 31 critics, indicating \\"Generally favorable reviews\\". Jon Espino from TheYoungFolks.com gave the film 9 out of 10 stars, stating: > Writer/Director Richard Ayoade had really outdone himself. The way he re- > imagined and modernized Fyodor Dostoevsky's novella The Double, is a pure > artistic vision. The dark tones are only enhanced by the light notes of > humor throughout the film. Ayoade's avant garde, experimental style and > minimalist set design sound like an odd couple, but they actually work great > together. He also goes on to praise Eisenberg's performance, saying: > In his best work since The Social Network, Eisenberg portrays the polarized > personalities of Simon and James with such ease. The story basically rests > on his shoulders as we follow him on his descent into madness. In between > the fast-paced dialogue and front-lit shots there is also a very complex > story that leaves the ending open to interpretation.

Massacre When World War II began, the Jews of Pavoloch lived in fear of the Nazi death squads, that had killed so many of their brethren in German-occupied countries. They had heard of the terrible things that the Nazis did to Jews, when they encountered them. On September 5, 1941, during Operation Barbarossa, their fears were justified, when an Einsatzgruppen squad drove into the shtetl. The Nazis had orders from SS- Brigadef√ºhrer Otto Rasch, to exterminate any Jews they found, and the Nazis obeyed the order to the letter. They rounded up all of the 1,500 Jews, and took them to the Jewish cemetery, located outside of Pavoloch. The Nazis forced all of the Jews to dig a mass grave, and made them kneel next to the grave. The Nazis shot all 1,500 of them, and the bodies fell into the mass grave. The Einsatzgruppen, seeing that their work was done, quickly filled the pit to exterminate any evidence of the slaughter, and drove away. Memorial After World War II ended, a memorial was erected in the cemetery, commemorating those that were brutally killed by the Einsatzgruppen. Also, the old synagogue, that survived the short-lived Nazi occupation, is now a museum. It houses the records of those that were murdered and contains exhibits on village history.

Nadir's pedigree World's richest race & Championship year Racing under trainer Moody Jolley,Miami News - February 4, 1976 Nadir made eight starts at age two and won five times including an October 26, 1957 victory in the world's richest horse race, the Garden State Stakes at Garden State Park for which he earned a purse of $155,047.Miami News - November 19, 1957 A few days later, Claiborne Farm owner Bull Hancock turned down an offer of $1 million for the colt from Travis Kerr.Deseret News - November 5, 1957 Nadir was voted American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt by the Daily Racing Form. The rival Thoroughbred Racing Association and Turf & Sports Digest polls were topped by Jewel's Reward. Racing at ages 3 & 4 Nadir went into 1958 as one of the early favorites for the Kentucky Derby. Based at Florida's Hialeah Park Race Track, he had a win at seven furlongs early in the year, but in the mile and an eighth Flamingo Stakes he ran fourth to Tim Tam, finishing more than seven lengths behind the winner. In April, he ran second in the Blue Grass Heights Purse at Keeneland won by Tim Tam in track record time.Milwaukee Sentinel - April 19, 1958 In his next start, the Derby Trial at Churchill Downs, Nadir was again beaten by winner Tim Tam, this time finishing fourth. Withdrawn from the Kentucky Derby and the remainder of the Triple Crown races, for a short time Nadir competed at shorter distances. On June 14, the colt won his first stakes race of 1958, taking the six-furlong Select Handicap at Monmouth Park in Oceanport, New Jersey by a nose.Miami News - June 15, 1958 In August, he captured the mile and one-eighth American Derby at Chicago's Arlington Park, a win that was the last major victory of his career.Montreal Gazette - August 18, 1958 Nadir ended 1958 with five wins in all and purse money totaling $204,312. As a four-year-old in 1959, he made eight starts, winning once. His best result in top-level races was a second in the prestigious Widener Handicap.Ocala Star-Banner - February 23, 1959 Nadir was retired to stand at stud at his owner's Claiborne Farm. For the eight years he served stallion duty in the United States, he met with modest success. The best of his offspring to race was the multiple stakes winning gelding R. Thomas. Beginning in 1968, Nadir stood for breeders in Japan, where he also had limited success. He died there in 1978.Nadir's progeny Nadir backwards In 1960, Nadir's trainer, Moody Jolley, purchased a yearling colt from Claiborne Farm that he named Ridan, which is Nadir spelled backwards.

Described by his contemporaries and by historians as \\"ingenious\\" and \\"restless,\\" many of his projects proved too ambitious to be realised and few attained real success.Hosack, Appendix, Note Q, 281Koeppel, 37 In certain quarters he was described contemptuously as a \\"visionary projector,\\" yet he was also credited with being the first to conceive a waterway to the West that would ultimately be achieved by the Erie Canal.Hosack, 281 Education and early career Colles was born in Ireland in 1739. From an early age he excelled in mathematics and mechanics. After the death of his father, Colles was raised by his uncle William Colles, himself a mathematician and engineer, and later tutored by the geographer and traveller Richard Pococke. It was Pococke who helped Colles get his start, securing for him a post as paymaster on the River Nore. Colles later worked on various inland navigation and architectural projects in Limerick, for a time under the Italian architect Davis Ducart. In 1767 Colles did surveys of Limerick which were later collected and published as a map. In 1764 he married Anne Keough of Dublin.Ristow, 4‚Äì6 After the death of his uncle William, Colles emigrated to America, landing in Philadelphia in 1771. There he advertised his services as an engineer and architect, but when no position materialised, Colles turned to public lecturing on science and engineering. His syllabus included, among other topics, lectures and demonstrations on hydraulics, mechanics, hydrostatics, pneumatics, and geography. Eager to do real engineering, Colles designed and built a steam engine for a local distillery, which he funded from his own pocket. The engine failed after a few trials, due not to its design but to the meager expense Colles was able to allot to its construction. Thinking that a favourable word from the scientific establishment might help him garner funds for a more powerful engine, Colles sought a review from David Rittenhouse and the American Philosophical Society. They noted the engine's shortcomings but praised its engineer: \\"We are of the opinion that the undertaker is well acquainted with the principles of this particular branch of Mechanics and very capable of carrying it into execution & therefore worthy of Public encouragement.\\" But no such encouragement came from the society. The society knew Colles and had allowed him access to its facilities for his lectures, but this may have worked against him. He was not invited to become a member as some distrusted him as a \\"showman,\\" a slight that deeply disappointed him. In 1774, Colles left Philadelphia for New York, and there he began his career in earnest, conceiving and designing the projects which would ultimately become his biography.Ristow, 11‚Äì12Koeppel, 39Bathe, 119 Projects In New York City, Colles proposed the construction of a water distribution system, consisting of a series of wells, a pump driven by a steam engine to extract the water, a reservoir to store the water, and the piping necessary to distribute it throughout the city. The Common Council of the city thought the project too ambitious but nevertheless granted him funding. By 1775 Colles had begun organising his project, and within months had completed the well, the pump, and the reservoir, but at the British invasion of the city in 1776, work on the project ceased.Popper, 180 While in New York, Colles was a frequent visitor to the shop of Anthony Lamb, a maker of scientific and engineering instruments. He also befriended Lamb's son, John Lamb, a Son of Liberty, who would go on to a prominent career in the Continental Army. Colles's sympathies during this period were with the Americans and perhaps owing to this and to his friendship with John Lamb, he thought it prudent to extract his family from the now British-controlled city.Ristow, 18 His water system was left incomplete and eventually it was destroyed by the British.Koeppel, 49 During the Revolution, Colles was more or less on the run, first to New Jersey, and thence to Kingston NY, and possibly to Albany. During that time he served as an artillery instructor in the Continental Army under General Henry Knox at the Pluckemin Academy.Seidel, 38 He remained in that position until Baron von Steuben was invited to take charge. It is not clear why Colles went to Kingston but he remained there until the British burned it in 1777. Possibly during his itinerancy, Colles sought work in upstate New York as an engineer on barricades and forts. It is also not clear what motivated his constant movements, whether to stay clear of the British or to seek a living doing surveys and engineering.Ristow, 41 As the war drew to a close, Colles petitioned in a letter to General Washington in 1783 to remove obstacles along a short stretch of the Ohio River, which would open the entire river to navigation from Fort Pitt to the Mississippi, a project Washington thought laudable, but next to impossible to achieve. Owing to the \\"present juvenile state of the Country‚Ä¶and the want of resources,\\" Washington concluded, \\"it appears to me that this is too early a day for accomplishing such great undertakings.\\" He further admonished Colles to attempt \\"works of more immediate public utility.\\"Ristow,24 In the 1780s, Colles surveyed the waterways of upstate New York and in 1785 presented to the New York State legislature a plan to improve the waterways of the Mohawk Valley in New York. In his pamphlet entitled the Proposal for the Speedy Settlement of the Waste and Unappropriated Lands on the Western Frontiers of the State of New York, Colles proposed that a series of canals and locks be constructed along the Mohawk River and Wood Creek that once completed, would connect the Hudson River and Lake Ontario, effectively uniting by water passage the Atlantic Ocean to the interior of North America. His plan called for the granting of land tracts along the route to canal workers and settlers, the land grants and the waterway improvements together guaranteeing, as his title suggested, the \\"speedy settlement\\" of the frontier.Colles, Speedy Settlement, 4 He presented the plan to the New York State legislature, which allowed for the idea so long as it was privately funded, but when Colles could not raise sufficient capital, he abandoned the project.Popper, 181 In 1789, Colles published A Survey of Roads of the United States, a set of strip maps, three to a page, of major routes between New England and Virginia. The Survey was the first comprehensive road atlas published in the United States, detailing roads and major landmarks‚Äîlakes, rivers, crossings, farms, taverns‚Äîthat a traveller would pass and might seek out on his travels between cities and across the barely settled frontier. Many of these maps were based on the surveys he conducted in upstate New York during the war years, while others, particularly in the south, were based on the surveys of two military surveyors, Simeon DeWitt and Robert Erskine. For his own surveys, Colles used a perambulator of his own design and construction. Colles proposed selling the atlas by means of subscription to travellers‚Äîreally a way of raising capital to complete the project‚Äîand he made it convenient by allowing subscribers to purchase only those strips of the map that were needed for whatever route the traveller was interested in. Despite these conveniences and the practicality of the Survey, subscriptions were too few to enable Colles to continue.Ristow, 42‚Äì50 Visionary As Colles grew older and his prospects diminished, his projects nevertheless grew increasingly bold and more elaborate. Though the Survey was a financial failure, its technical merits emboldened Colles to propose another atlas to be called the Geographical Ledger and Systematized Atlas (1794), which was the Survey extended to the rest of the world. The Ledger would consist of individual sheets, each one to show approximately two degrees of latitude by four degrees of longitude, at a scale of ten miles to the inch. It would also be indexed and, like the Survey, would contain references of major landmarks. The Survey in fact was to be incorporated into the Ledger. Its title was suggested by its search mechanism, that through the use of the index and references, \\"the situation of places can be found as speedily as a merchant can find any particular account in his ledger.\\"Colles, Geographical Ledger, Introduction But again, little came of this scheme; only the introduction and a few plates survive.Ristow, 79 Perhaps Colles's most ambitious project was the Timber Canal, a set of canals to be built entirely of timber and elevated above ground rather than dug into it. It would solve at least two problems: the difficulty of digging into the ground (\\"enormous roots of the trees make digging expensive\\"), and what to do with the \\"immense forests...[and] timber in abundance now constantly burning and rotting away.\\"Colles, Proposal for a Design, 6 As was his practice, Colles put his ideas into a pamphlet, the Proposal for a Design for the Promotion of the Interests of the United States (1808). Like his other pamphlets, the Proposal was a work of the imagination, describing in meticulous detail how the canals should be designed and built, how their construction would be funded by private companies, and what benefits would accrue to the settlers whom he expected would \\"flock towards the canals.\\"Colles, Proposal for a Design, 12 Colles planned a single route across New Jersey to start, extending from the Navesink River west to Bordentown on the Delaware River. Of all his projects, the Timber Canal was the most revolutionary, and perhaps for this reason the least likely to be achieved. Nothing ever came of it.Ristow, 21‚Äì35Popper, 186 Later years During the War of 1812 Colles established and supervised an optical telegraph system to keep New York City protected from British Attacks. It was perhaps the second telegraph system established in the United States, and the first in New York City. He was commissioned a Captain in the New York Militia. Colles spent his last years in New York City, where he proposed one last scheme: a semaphore telegraph system to be strung along the Atlantic seaboard from Passamaquoddy Bay (Maine) to New Orleans. He did manage to erect a small system between Sandy Hook, New Jersey and New York City, which was used for a time to send word to the city of incoming ships.O'Reilly, 4 Earlier in his career, in 1784, Colles had constructed a solar microscope and offered public displays of insects and other minute phenomena as seen on a microscopic level. In 1815, he collected and published his observations in a pamphlet entitled the An Account of the Astonishing Beauties and Operations of Nature. But his career was at an end. In 1816, his friend and sometime benefactor, John Pintard, offered him a post as custodian of the old almshouse building which was to house various New York scientific and arts institutions. Colles was in this position only a few months before he died in 1816. He was buried at St. Paul's, in New York City, in an unmarked grave.Ristow, 89‚Äì90 Legacy What is known of Colles comes mostly through reminiscences of friends and rivals, through scattered tributes to his ideas over the years; and not least through his many pamphlets, which were always detailed, sometimes plaintive, occasionally poetic and prophetic. He figures as a technology pioneer in America, someone who was there at the beginning of several historical tides in American engineering history‚Äîof canal building, of cartography, and of water systems‚Äîthough his lack of success relegated him to historical obscurity. His lack of success has been attributed to Colles's being \\"one of those gifted men whose misfortune consists in being ahead of their times,\\"O'Reilly, 10 and to the difficulties of being so ambitious in so young and unestablished a country: \\"[Colles] was urban in an agrarian age, and an inventor, geographer, and engineer before there were many.\\"Popper, 178‚Äì190 Colles himself attributed failure to bad luck. In a rueful self-assessment he made to his friend and earliest biographer, John Wakefield Francis, Colles allowed that \\"Had I been brought up a hatter, people would have come into the world without heads.\\"Francis,183 NotesReferences *Bathe, Greville.

College career Roach was born in St. Louis, Missouri, and spent his first two college years at Indiana University playing for the Hoosiers in 18 of their 22 games, scoring 1 goal and logging an assist, playing alongside future New England teammates Kevin Alston and Alec Purdie. He was redshirted his sophomore year before transferring to Saint Louis University in 2009. He scored 14 goals and 7 assists in 68 starts for the Billikens, being named to the Atlantic 10 second-team All-Conference and being recognized as the Most Outstanding Player of the Atlantic 10 Conference Championship as a sophomore in 2009. Roach broke his leg playing in a club league the summer of 2010, and later had a run-in with a sprinkler head beyond the touchline during a training match for Saint Louis, which injured his knee. Roach spent most of the Billikens' 2010 campaign on the sideline with these injuries, playing only six games for Saint Louis. Roach again suffered an injury in his senior season, missing six games. Despite this setback, he led all Billikens players with four assists. Despite setbacks in his final two collegiate years, he became known as a leader for Saint Louis. Citing his experience and ability to work with younger players, Billikens coach Mike McGinty said of Roach \\"He has intangible leadership and personality qualities that this team needs...he can, at some level, be a coach on field\\". Professional career=New England Revolution The New England Revolution drafted Roach 60th overall in the 2012 MLS Supplemental Draft.

In both cases the directional growth is considered to be due to asymmetrical distribution of auxin, a plant growth hormone. Although the model has been criticized and continues to be refined, it has largely stood the test of time. Basic model The model was independently proposed by the Russian scientist Nikolai Cholodny of the University of Kiev in 1927 and by Frits Warmolt Went of the California Institute of Technology in 1928, both based on work they had done in 1926. The basic elements of the theory are that auxin is the sole hormone that controls growth in gravitropism and phototropism; the rate of growth depends on the concentration of auxin; and both gravity and unidirectional light affect the movement of auxin. The original theory predicts that since the growth factor would move from the lighted side to the shady side, growth would slow on the lighted side and speed up on the shady side, so the stem will begin to bend toward the light source. Went's 1926 experiment appeared to demonstrate that auxin moved towards the shady side of the tip of the coleoptile, the pointed protective sheath covering the emerging shoot. Cholodny and Went proposed that auxin is synthesized in the coleoptile tip, which senses light and sends the auxin down the shady side of the coleoptile, causing asymmetric growth with the shoot bending towards the light source. Later experiments by Dolk in 1930 showed that auxin moved from a source along a horizontal coleoptile section, concentrating along the bottom of the section and thus causing the shoot to bend upward. The Cholodny‚ÄìWent model for the phototropic movement of shoots was later extended to gravitropism of roots, where auxin was thought to inhibit rather than stimulate growth and to accumulate in the lower side of a root section, causing the root to bend downward. Criticism The theory was widely accepted when first proposed, but began to receive serious criticism in the mid-1980s. Arguments against the model have included views that growth regulators other than auxin may be involved, and that there is no difference in the concentration of auxin on the light and shady sides, or not enough difference to explain the difference in growth rates. A 1987 paper reported results indicating that geotropic curvature of both roots and shoots could be explained by local migration of auxin from one side to another rather than by movement along the whole length of the organ. Other studies showed that sometimes tropic response do not depend on the coleoptile tip, and the development of the shoots' bend may be greater than the auxin gradient of that shoot. Critics have also had problems with the reliability of Went's small sample sizes and use of agar blocks instead of actual auxin concentration measurements. Support Evidence that supports Cholodny‚ÄìWent over competing theories was reported by Iino and Briggs in 1984, showing that there was decreased growth on the lighted side of a corn coleoptile and increased growth of the shaded side. Experiments on Arabidopsis thaliana in 1993 following a similar methodology gave similar results, and these have been backed up by direct measurements of auxin distribution. Other theories predict slower growth on both sides, but particularly on the lighted side (Blaauw/Paal 1918/1919), or faster growth on the shaded side but no change in growth on the lighted side (Boysen Jensen 1928). Experiments with tomato seedlings in 1989 by Harrison and Pickard led to the conclusion that the mechanism was also valid for dicotyledons. In 1990‚Äì1991 Moritoshi Iino in Tokyo made measurements of IAA (auxin) in maize coleoptiles in response to both light and gravity. He confirmed that auxin was redistributed to the shady or lower side, and that bending occurred progressively as the auxin moved down the coleoptile. A 1993 report gave evidence that growth rates were changing on both the light and shady sides, as predicted. Experiments in the late 1990s with radiolabelled IAA (auxin, indole-3-acetic acid) supported the view that auxin synthesized in the tip of the coleoptile was being transported to the bottom side of the coleoptile, causing it to curve upward. A study of Arabidopsis reported in 2000 showed that basipetal (from the tip) transport of auxin controlled gravitropic responses in the roots of these plants. One of the main arguments against the Cholodny-Went hypothesis was removed when it was reported in 2003 that even when there was an exogenous source of auxin an endogenous gradient could develop. However, there are indications that the model is not complete. The auxin gradient may not be relevant to early phases of graviresponse in roots, and it seems that the gravitropic response of shoots only involves local movement of auxin. Further research into phototropism and gravitropism is now investigating the roles of other plant hormones in the growth process and on the gravitropic and phototropic properties of plants using modern time- lapse photography. Although it is clear that, at least with roots, auxin plays a major role in gravitropism it seems that other hormones acting with auxin are also involved. Cytokinin may be an inhibitor of root cap growth that controls early gravitropism in roots. Ethylene seems to be important in gravitropism in shoots, perhaps affecting sensitivity to auxin or its rate of transport.

The property is owned by the District of Columbia Housing Authority, and its 352-units are divided into family and senior housing. It was constructed between 1965 and 1968. In November 1967, the first families moved in. History Potomac Gardens was designed by the Metcalf and Associates architectural firm, and was built from 1965 and 1968 by Edward M. Crough, Inc. It contained the innovative Potomac Gardens Multi-Service Center, bringing community services into the new public housing project. The Friendship House on Capitol Hill ran the Center with the help of site-coordinator S. Preston- Jones and with additional funding from the Junior League. The chief medical officer in the clinic was Dr. John A. Algee. One of the first managers of Potomac Gardens was Majurial Crawley. During the 1980s, Constance Love was the manager. In 1971, the Greater Washington Board of Trade, the regional business association, gave its Award for Excellence in Architecture to the architectural firm, Metcalf and Associates, and the builder, Edward M. Crough, Inc., of Potomac Gardens. The Edward M. Crough Center for Architectural Studies at Catholic University is named after Potomac Gardens' builder. In 1974, Potomac Gardens was featured in the American Institute of Architects' A Guide to the Architecture of Washington, DC: Twenty Walking and Motoring Tours of Washington and the Vicinity. Potomac Gardens was part of the guide's Southeast Washington tour. Many of the earliest residents had escaped the harsh life of agricultural work, especially cotton picking, in the South. As part of the City Lights Program funded by the DC Humanities Council, senior residents worked with curators and public historians to create a traveling museum exhibition and a documentary about their historical experiences. Many musicians and bands have emerged from Potomac Gardens, including The East Coast Connection with its single \\"Summer in the Parks\\" and, more recently, SouljaGanG Bilal. Potomac Gardens also figures in numerous novels, such as James Patterson's Cross (2006) and George Pelecanos' The Cut (2011). Former White House aide Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North, USMC, performed some of his court-ordered 1,200 hours of community service there before his Iran-Contra conviction was overturned. In April 1989, Jesse Jackson along with Mayor Marion Barry visited Potomac Gardens, where they played a one-on-one basketball game. Jackson was considering running for District Mayor, if Barry chose not to run. In 1991, after meeting privately with supporters from around the country at the Omni Shoreham Hotel, Jackson returned to Potomac Gardens by Metro and delivered his formal withdrawal from the Presidential race. Also in April 1989, Geraldo Rivera featured Potomac Gardens during a segment for his TV talk show, called ‚ÄúBloodied Streets and Broken Dreams.‚Äù As part of the show, Geraldo referred to that block as the most dangerous in America.http://wamu.org/programs/metro_connection/15/01/16/what_does_the_future_hold_for_capitol_hills_potomac_gardens Community life In 1995, Little Lights Urban Ministries was founded by Steven Park, serving children in Potomac Gardens and the surrounding area. In Faith Forward, Steven and Mary Park discuss their religious conversions and the importance of Potomac Gardens' residents to their religious work. Potomac Garden resident, Khaulysha, was profiled in a June 2014 article on the success of the Little Lights program.http://www.thescribblepadblog.com/2014/06/little- lights-urban-ministries-in-dc.html In 2013, Liane Scott brought Grassroots DC to Potomac Gardens to provide training in journalism and media production to residents, who then go on to produce information to educate policy makers and the public about issues and causes vital to the under-served communities of the District of Columbia Metropolitan Area. The Senior Resident Council was established in 1979 \\"to foster and improve relationships within the development and with the surrounding community.\\" The Senior Resident Council organizes activities for seniors and provides assistance during emergencies. In the early 1990s, it worked with the group City Lights, and with funding from the DC Humanities Council and National Endowment for the Humanities, to make a video about the lives of seniors in Potomac Gardens. In connection to this project, some of the seniors testified before Congress in support of NEH funding. Controversy and crime In 1983, Martha Queen, the ANC representative for the area and herself a resident of Potomac Gardens for more than a decade said: ‚ÄúI like it here,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI like the people. I don't like the problems. But the people are good people.‚Äù But ‚ÄúThere's a lot of trespassers here.‚Äù Deteriorating conditions in some parts of the complex, Ms. Queen said, gave the impression that the project had been \\"abandoned\\" by the city and was ripe for invasion by outsiders. In 1991, Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly had fences installed around and within the property to halt trespassers, but this action was controversial. Some residents did not want the fences. \\"It‚Äôs disrespectful. We aren‚Äôt animals. We don‚Äôt need to be caged,\\" one resident told The Washington Post. It took 45 police officers to quell a violent negative reaction. Mayor Kelly was vindicated, at least in the short term: Drug arrests declined dramatically after the fence went up, though crimes did continue. But much of the drug activity just shifted to other areas, and assaults and robberies remained high‚Äîto the point in 1995 that Marion Barry‚Äôs administration hired the Nation of Islam on an emergency contract to restore order. Jesse Jackson used Potomac Gardens as a backdrop for a press conference to announce he would not run for president in 1992, calling it ‚Äúthe urban crisis personified, the epitome of national neglect.‚Äù In June 2010, fifteen individuals were arrested, according to a joint press release issued in conjunction with the U.S. Attorney's office, the MPDC, the FBI and the U.S. Park Police, who all worked together on the arrests as part of a long-term task force combating gangs, drugs and violence. The bust yielded heroin, cocaine, guns, scales and other drug trafficking paraphernalia and was described as significant by the MPD1 Commander David Kamperin.http://www.thehillishome.com/2010/06/potomac-gardens-drug-bust- yields-15-arrests/ In November 2011, a series of violent attacks in the area surrounding the project drew widespread media attention and a response from DC Police Chief Cathy Lanier.

History This trade magazine appeared for the first time on 5 December 1891 in Charleville in the Ardennes department in northeastern France with the title l'Usine, subtitled \\"Organe de l'industrie des Ardennes et du Nord-Est\\" (\\"Organ of Industry of the Ardennes and the North-East\\"). It was published with the encouragement of a regional trade association, the Syndicat des industriels m√©tallurgiques ardennais. And an editorial was specific: \\"L'Usine hopes to become the organ for everyone who has at heart the prosperity of the industries of the Ardennes and their expansion.\\" It was a newspaper conceived entrepreneurs for entrepreneurs. It was an information tool to help them act and make decisions, and a communications tool and source of advertising for managers. At that time, the Ardennes and the northeast of France were considered a favoured area for industrial development. In 1905, it was bought by Camille Didier, who had become its publisher in 1901 at the age of 26 and who had opened an office in Paris. Camille Didier sought to turn l'Usine into a nationally distributed magazine. In 1914, the magazine had 3,000 subscribers. In response to the invasion of France by Germany during World War I, the newspaper moved its office to Paris and remained there. In 1935, the magazine printed 35,000 copies of each issues and its office was at 15 de la rue Bleue. At the outbreak of World War II, the magazine called on its readers to support the war effort. After Paris was occupied by German forces, the magazine continued to publish but limited itself to factual information such as commodity prices. At the time of the Liberation of Paris, its publisher (still Camille Didier) was accused of having collaborated with the enemy by continuing to publish during the German occupation. He was supported by his cousin Jeanne Carlot, a resistance figure in the Ardennes who had published an underground resistance newspaper named l'Ardenne. After an interruption of 11 months, the magazine resumed publication in 1945 with a new name, l'Usine nouvelle.

Early life and education Although Rains was born in a small town in Missouri, he moved to California with his family at a young age. After graduating from Bakersfield High School in 1959, he entered the University of California, Berkeley. Rains received a B.A. in political science, a Bachelor of Law degree, and a Doctorate of Jurisprudence from the University of California, Berkeley. Upon graduation he moved to Ventura, California, where he began his professional life as a prosecutor in the Ventura County District Attorney's Office. Rains' activity at age 29 in civic affairs in Ventura led to him receiving the \\"Distinguished Service Award\\" as the community's \\"Outstanding Citizen\\".Series V: Press Releases, Omer L.

He served on the University of California Alumni Council and later as a trustee of the Robert Maynard Hutchins/ Encyclopedia Britannic Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions. Political career/ legislative highlights At age 32, Rains was elected to serve the first of three terms in the California Senate representing the Central Coast Area of California (principally the Counties of Santa Barbara and Ventura). Although a fiscal conservative, Rains was progressive on social issues. When Ronald Reagan was Governor of California, Rains and Reagan developed a close working relationship and friendship that continued during Reagan's later years as President. One of several items that drew the two together was Rains' ardent demand for fiscal responsibility. In that regard, he took legislative action to cure regulatory abuse and authored the first \\"zero-based\\" budgeting and \\"Sunset\\" bills in state history. The populist/progressive side of him was earmarked by landmark legislation in the areas of political reform, alternative energy, conservation, protection of children & seniors, and promotion of women's rights. In the Senate while serving as a gubernatorial appointee to the State Geothermal Resources Task Force and the SolarCal Council, Rains sponsored legislation encouraging the development and use of alternative energy sources, such as solar, geothermal, biomass conversion, cogeneration, wind, and developing ocean technologies. He also authored legislation to purchase beach property for public use, authored Container Deposit legislation (the \\"Bottle Bill\\"), secured passage of an historic measure to protect the California deserts by preventing the \\"piracy\\" of California's native plants, enacted legislation to prevent strip-mining in the National and State Forests, and was instrumental in establishing both Redwood National Park and Channel Islands National Park. The state thereafter named a famous bike trail after Rains for his work in connecting various state beach parks along the coast of California. Rains served as chairperson of the Joint Legislative Committee on Legal Equality. His comprehensive package of 68 bills allowed the cause of women's rights to advance in California. As a result of his efforts California became the first state in the nation to conform its laws to the \\"Equal Rights Amendment.\\" The President of the National Women's Political Caucus stated that \\"Senator Omer Rains has done more to advance the cause of women's rights and equality under the law than any legislator in California history.\\" [3][4] Official Senate resolution regarding the legislative career of Senator Rains Available at http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/California_State_Resolution_Relative_to_Commending_Senator_Omer_L._Rains CA Resolution Commending SOR Legal and business career As an international attorney, financier and investment advisor Rains has maintained offices in Geneva, Switzerland; Sacramento, California; Lake Tahoe; and New York City.

Written by Oliver Drake and Betty Burbridge, the film is about a cowboy who rides to the rescue when badguys kidnap a beautiful woman. Plot At a St. Louis opera house in 1860, a singer in blackface named Jerry Barton, known as \\"King of the Minstrels\\", comes backstage and asks his sweetheart, Lettie Morgan (Ann Rutherford), to elope. Lettie's Aunt Hortense, fearing that Barton is a fortune hunter, tells Lettie she is not the heiress she thought she was and that she has been living off her aunt's charity. With no fortune to hunt, Barton informs Lettie that an artist cannot be burdened with the responsibility of a wife. Outside the opera house, Lettie meets a chorus girl named Honey (Barbara Pepper), who is preparing to leave with her theatrical troupe in a caravan heading West. When the troupe's producer mistakes Lettie for the star, she joins the group as \\"Mary Varden\\". The troupe's wagon train is escorted by Captain Tex Autry (Gene Autry) of the U.S. Cavalry and his singing plainsmen. The troupe misses the wagon train, however, and must travel alone. On their way to San Francisco, the caravan is ambushed by a gang of thieves. Tex and his men arrive on the scene and following a gunfight, the gang is chased off. After Tex saves Lettie from a runaway wagon, he comments on the foolishness of risking his men's lives for a bunch of \\"crazy showgirls\\". Angered by his insolence, Lettie decides to walk rather than ride with Tex. Eventually she gets tired and asks Tex if she can ride with him. The troupe arrives safely at Fort Henry, which is run by Colonel Seward (Frank LaRue). An Indian named Young Deer warns Tex that Chief White Eagle is preparing to attack the army. When horses are stolen from the fort by a renegade named Buck LaCrosse (Warner Richmond), Tex saves the horses. Utah Joe (Allan Sears), who is in league with Chief White Eagle, falsely accuses Tex of complicity with the Indians, and Tex is soon arrested for treason. Aunt Hortense arrives with Judge Forsythe Lane (Niles Welch), who hopes to marry Lettie and use her money to run for president. Aunt Hortense encourages her to marry Lane. Lettie appeals to Lane on Tex's behalf, hinting that she will marry him if he will save Tex. As the wagon train prepares to leave, Lettie sadly says goodbye to Tex, and Lane promises to join Lettie after the trial. However, Lane double-crosses Lettie and helps to secure Tex's conviction. Following his conviction and death sentence, Tex escapes with the help of his friends. Suspicious that Utah Joe has promised to supply Chief White Eagle with ammunition, Tex orders his friend Frog (Smiley Burnette) to join the wagon train to spy on Utah Joe. While the caravan camps, Frog tells Lettie that Lane encouraged Tex's conviction. Honey, who has fallen in love with Frog, tells Lettie that Lane was probably jealous of Lettie's feelings for Tex, but Lettie denies loving the soldier. When Utah Joe announces plans to take a new route through Kern Valley, Frog warns that the valley is filled with renegades and unfriendly Indians. Later that night Tex arrives and overhears Utah Joe direct Chief White Eagle to the wagons stocked with gunpowder. Tex pulls his gun on them, and a fight ensues, during which LaCrosse arrives on the scene. As Frog and Tex try to fight off the renegades, the soldiers ride up. Chief White Eagle is shot during the scuffle, but Utah Joe escapes. LaCrosse is arrested and, under the threat of a firing squad, confesses that Utah Joe instigated the horse stealing at the fort, while he let loose the clever black stallion who opened the corral gate. LaCrosse also warns the caravan that Utah Joe is leading them into an ambush. As the caravan prepares to leave, Utah Joe, now dressed as an Indian, sends a smoke signal, and the Indians approach. Frog is grazed by a bullet and inadvertently becomes attached to the underside of the runaway powder wagon. Tex manages to save him, and igniting the wagon, sends it into a throng of Indians. The Indians retreat once the plainsmen arrive, and as the wagon train departs, Tex and Lettie kiss, with Honey nursing Frog behind the embracing couple. Cast * Gene Autry as Capt.

It probably dates from the twelfth century. It was owned by Thomas de Moulton in the early thirteenth century and it was during this period of unrest when the fortifications were most likely constructed.Roffe, David; \\"Moulton: King's Hall\\"; Roffe.co.uk. Retrieved 13 June 2012 It remained under occupation by the Moulton family until at least 1313. Due to the lack of any formal excavation and the paucity of sources, much remains unclear about the site. It is unknown whether it was a true castle or merely a fortified manor house, why it was so isolated and so far from the village, and why and when it fell into disuse. It was in need of repair in 1461 and mostly gone by 1531. There are no ruins visible today, and the site consists of nothing more than a large D-shaped moat and earthwork, barely perceptible from nearby roads. The only investigations into the site took place during World War II when the Home Guard discovered thirteenth-century pottery while digging a bunker, and a later fieldwalking expedition from a local school. It has been reported that some of the stone from the castle was used to build part of the church porch at nearby Holbeach.

Throughout the 1990s, it was commonly referred to as the ‚ÄúHome Alone house‚Äù in reference to the similar looking neocolonial residence featured in the eponymous film that had become a pop culture phenomenon. The house was built in 1914 by Lucia Stone in honor of her deceased husband, Edgar Stone, for $34,500 (equivalent to $880,000 in 2018). It was restored by Dr. John and Rebecca Marriott from 1994-1999 and submitted to the National Register of Historic Places by John and Kathy Pritchard on August 16, 2001. It was admitted on March 21, 2003 for the historical impact its various owners and their families have had on Sioux City; particularly Arthur Sanford, an entrepreneur who was named ‚ÄúSioux City‚Äôs Greatest Builder‚Äù in 1954 that had ‚Äúexercised more influence on Sioux City‚Äôs landscape than any other individual‚Äù. He is associated with the development, financing, and or management of approximately $400,000,000 (2018 inflation-adjusted) in real estate over the course of his career. Six of his properties are also listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Along with his wife, Stella, Arthur was also a prominent philanthropist who donated approximately $5,000,000 (2018 inflation-adjusted) to various causes throughout their lives with the ‚Äúaim and ambition to do everything to make opportunities for the younger men and women of Sioux City‚Äù.

Architecture and design  Constructed in 1914 by Swedish immigrant Andrew Ostling,Building Permit. 18 July 1914 the Sanford House is predominately an example of neocolonial architecture from the Colonial Revival movement with Prairie influence. The architect is unknown, but potentially Joseph E. Wing. Officially two stories (the first floor 2,170 sq. ft and second floor 1,908 sq. ft), it also features a 2,138 sq. ft finished basement, and a 600 sq. ft semi-finished third floor attic for a total size of 6,816 square feet. It has 4 bedrooms, 5 bathrooms, 2 fireplaces, and a sunroom that was added in the 1980s. The north wing of the house is a dedicated servants' quarters which includes a bedroom and bathroom on the second floor, kitchen on the first floor, and a scullery with built-in mangle, serving panty, and coal bunker in the basement. In the Marriott era, the coal bunker was converted to an office. Connecting the servant floors is a dumbwaiter and private stairwell. Every room is also connected to the servants' quarters via bell pull system. In the Sanford era, a mural by Elsa (n√©e Krome) Nourse, an apprentice of Carl Gustaf Nelson, was added to the foyer and grand staircase.

Wright, married Edgar Heathcote Stone. Edgar attended Lake Forest Academy and graduated from Yale University with honors in 1878. His classmate and lifelong friend was William Howard Taft. View of front upon completion in 1915 from northeast corner Edgar‚Äôs father, Thomas Jefferson Stone, was among the first settlers of Sioux City in 1856 and helped survey, acquire, and finance much of its early land development. In 1871, Thomas co- founded the First National Bank of Sioux City with Asahel W. Hubbard and served as its president. Among his many civic contributions are the creation of the Sergeant Floyd Monument and eponymous Stone State Park. Upon his death in 1904, Thomas bequeathed Edgar and Lucia approximately one-third of his $400,000 estate (equivalent to $10,000,000 in 2018). Edgar, who had been suffering from a rheumatic disorder for years, unexpectedly died in 1911 leaving Lucia a widow without children. In his honor, Lucia donated 800 acres of Thomas‚Äô estate for the creation on Stone State Park, the land to the Sisters of St. Benedict for which MercyOne Siouxland Medical Center now stands, and the development of a mansion atop of the city‚Äôs summit. On July 15, 1914, she purchased two lots on the corner on Twentieth and Summit streets from W. L. Frost for $4,500. Construction by builder Andrew Oustling was finished in 1915 totaling $30,000 for a total development cost of $34,500 (equivalent to $880,000 in 2018). Lucia sold the Stone House to surgeon Dr. J. E. Moore in 1920 and married prominent attorney Thomas G. Henderson in 1921. She unexpectedly died in 1922 and Thomas jumped to his death off the Davidson Building in 1925, which Arthur Sanford helped develop.  Sanford Era  Arthur and Stella Sanford acquired the Sanford House in 1936 from lumber baron George and Mary Avery. Arthur was born in Minneapolis to Austrian-Jewish immigrants James and Edith Sanford and was immersed in business from birth at his father‚Äôs mercantile store. He dropped-out of the University of Minnesota and Wharton School of Finance and Commerce. He interned at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co and served in World War I as a sergeant major in a logistics casual company in Paris. Kennedy and the Sanfords outside the Sanford House north wing, 1960 On July 3, 1920, he married Stella Wolff, daughter of air conditioning pioneer Alfred Rudolph Wolff, who had just graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The same year he established Arthur Stanford & Co to sell mortgage bonds, which he later expanded to development and management of real estate. When the Sioux Apartment Hotel fell into receivership, Arthur and Stella permanently relocated to Sioux City to salvage the venture. Over the next 60 years, Arthur was associated with the development, financing, and or management of approximately $400,000,000 (2018 inflation-adjusted) in real estate in Iowa, Illinois, Nebraska, California, Texas, and New York. Six of those properties are now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 1954, Arthur was named ‚ÄúSioux City‚Äôs Greatest Builder‚Äù who had ‚Äúexercised more influence on Sioux City‚Äôs landscape than any other individual‚Äù. In Sioux City, he is associated with the Orpheum Electric Building, Warrior Hotel, Masonic Temple, Davidson Building, Insurance Exchange Building, Frances Building, Shaare Zion Synagogue, Sioux Apartment Hotel, Bellevue Apartment, Argonaut Apartment, Castle-Stellart Apartment, Metz Apartment, Nyol Apartment, 5 theaters, two-subdivisions, and the bus terminal. In Des Moines, he is associated with The Commodore, Des Moines Building, Bolton Apartments, Windsor Terrace Apartments, Fleming Building and 3660 Grand Ave. Also, The Inn Hotel at Lake Okoboji, Hotel Tallcorn in Marshalltown, Chieftain Hotel in Council Bluffs and Sherman House Hotel and The Ambassador East in Chicago. A serial entrepreneur, Arthur was also involved in many other ventures. In 1928, he co-founded Mid-Continent Airlines with Arthur Hanford, Jr. It was acquired by Braniff International Airways in 1952. In 1929, he gained 60% control of the hog cholera vaccine market by consolidating five of the largest serum producers into Allied Laboratories, which was acquired by Dow Chemical. In 1941, he co-founded the Sioux Soya Mills Company with Francis Lytle. It was the first soybean processing plant in Iowa and was acquired by Cargill in 1947. In 1947, Arthur and Stella established the Stellart Charitable Foundation with the ‚Äúaim and ambition to do everything to make opportunities for the younger men and women of Sioux City‚Äù. They donated approximately $5,000,000 (2018 inflation-adjusted) to various causes over the ensuing years, including the $150,000 (equivalent to $1,700,000 in 2018) for redevelopment of the Booker T. Washington Center, which was renamed the Sanford Community Center. Approximately $25,000 (equivalent to $205,000 in 2018) for renovations of the Mary Treglia Community Center. Another $77,000 (equivalent to $586,000 in 2018) for the Sanford Organ in Eppley Auditorium of Morningside College in 1967, and $150,000 (equivalent to $946,000 in 2018) for the Stella Sanford Day Care Center in 1971. Starting in 1940, Arthur was also very involved in politics and served as the Iowa delegate in six Democratic national conventions. In 1950 he served as a United States delegate to the International Labor Organization conference in Geneva. In 1952 and 1956 he was the Iowa finance chairman for presidential candidate Adlai Stevenson II. In 1959 he served as chairman of Governor Loveless‚Äô United Nations committee. While serving as the Iowa finance chairman during the 1960 United States presidential campaign, Arthur hosted presidential candidate John F. Kennedy at the Sanford House. In 1966, he served as chairman of the reception committee for Senator Robert Kennedy at the Orpheum Theater he built. He also served on many commissions, committees, and campaign teams. Following Arthur and Stella‚Äôs deaths in 1981, the Sanford House was sold to neurosurgeon Dr. Alexander and June Kleider.  Marriott Era  Dr. John and Rebecca Marriott = A third-generation Sioux native, Dr. John Thomas Marriott II and his wife, Rebecca (n√©e Beelman) Marriott, acquired the Sanford House on June 20, 1994 from neurologist Dr. Leonel and Yolanda Herrera. Following a decorated combat deployment to Panama for the War on Drugs and a radiology residency in Ohio, John returned to Sioux City to join the Sioux City Radiological Group. The counterculture movement kicked off by President Kennedy‚Äôs administration, whom the Sanford's ironically helped elect, caused neocolonial style to not only become unpopular, but loathed. The Sanford House was not immune and the ‚Äúold world‚Äù elegance of hardwood floors and crystal chandeliers gave-way to 1960s decor. Aside of the sunroom added by the Herra‚Äôs in the 1980s, the house remained untouched until the Marriott‚Äôs acquisition in 1994. Over the next 5 years, Rebecca and general contractor Gary Bender, restored every room, fixture, and decor to its neocolonial roots. The entire basement was refinished and the coal bunker was converted to an office. The house was commonly referred to as \\"Marriott Manor\\" by the contractors. In July 1998, their son, Thomas Montgomery Marriott, establish his first startup, Penny Computer Company, in the Sanford House basement. Fulfilling his great- grandfather‚Äôs original dream, John and Rebecca sold the Sanford House to technologist John and Kathy Pritchard on August 16, 1999 and moved to The Antebellum in Grogan's Point of The Woodlands, Texas; leaving 147 years and 6 generations of roots behind. = Dr. Charles Montgomery Marriott = John‚Äôs father, Dr. Charles Montgomery Marriott, was a radiologist and multi-decorated World War II hero who co-founded the Sioux City Radiological Group in 1956. Overcoming the loss of both hands from a stielhandgranate while saving his platoon during the Rhineland Offensive, he practiced diagnostic and nuclear interventional radiology in Sioux City for 27 years. He also served on the board of directors, as chief of staff, and as department head of radiation therapy at St. Vincent's Hospital (now MercyOne Siouxland Medical Center). He was a Fellow of the American College of Radiology and Diplomat of the American Board of Radiology. Most of his career was focused on awareness and treatment of cancer. As chapter president of the American Cancer Society, he was instrumental in bringing and practicing advanced cancer treatment to Sioux City, including external beam radiotherapy from cobalt and linear acceleration, and the first CAT Scanner in Iowa (tenth in the United States). He regularly spoke at schools for anti-smoking campaigns. In 1964, he co- developed the 14 acre, 8 building Medical Plaza Professional Center on Hamilton Boulevard. During his retirement, Charles helped establish and was president of the Sioux City Convention Center. He was bestowed the Sertoma International \\"Service to Mankind\\" award in 1992. Charles grew up on 15 Gilman Terrace, two blocks from the Sanford House, and was George Avery‚Äôs paperboy for the Sioux City Tribune. His wife and two daughters survived the Flight 982 crash at the Sioux Gateway Airport in 1968. = Secretary William Henry Marriott = Charles‚Äô father, William Henry Marriott, Esq. was a prominent grain trade executive with the Terminal Grain Corporation (now Tegra Corporation) who served as the Secretary of the Sioux City Grain Exchange. He was instrumental in opening commercial barge navigation of the Missouri River and establishing the Missouri River Basin Project, including the Gavins Point Dam. He came to Sioux City from Wakefield, a frontier settlement his father helped pioneer. William was immersed in business and the grain trade from birth at his father‚Äôs store, Marriott Mercantile, which initially specialized in quality \\"Seeds that grow!\\" thirty-five years before the Grain Standards Act of 1916. He attended Brown‚Äôs Business College at 17 years of age while working for the Great Northern Railway. Suffering from poor health following a botched appendicitis surgery in 1915, William wore an abdominal binder for the rest of his life and unexpectedly died in 1951. = Judge John Thomas Marriott I = William‚Äôs father, Judge John Thomas Marriott I, was among the first settlers of Wakefield, Nebraska in July 1881. The son of English immigrants William and Sarah (n√©e Pacey) Marriott, John became motherless and an only child at one year old when Sarah suffered maternal death. Described as a ‚Äúhustler‚Äù who can ‚Äúraise anything from peanuts to presidents‚Äù, he was determined to make Wakefield rival Sioux City, whose population was around 7,500 at the time. He built and operated the first store, Marriott Mercantile, for 42 years. Initially specializing in ‚ÄúSeeds that grow!‚Äù, he expanded to groceries, lands loans and insurance, conveyance, collections, brokerage and notary services. The store also operated a millinery led by his wife Mary Louise (n√©e Rice) Marriott, the sister of James Montgomery Rice, aunt of Montgomery Case, and great-granddaughter of William Montgomery. At peak, John controlled approximately 20% of Wakefield's commercial real estate and a cattle farm on the outskirt. He adopted the new slogan \\"Marriott Means Business\\". In 1906, John helped bring Wakefield into the electric age. On the Board of Education, he helped introduce formal academics to Wakefield and as a Justice of the peace, helped create laws for the horseless carriage. As of 2018, the Presbyterian Church he built on 3rd Street continues to assemble its congregation every Sunday. Their daughter, Caroline Montgomery Marriott, was killed by the Spanish Flu epidemic in 1918. Distraught, John suffered a severe stroke in February 1921 and remained in a coma for fourteen weeks. When he regained consciousness, he could no longer speak and his health continued to fail until his death in September 1923. Marriott Mercantile now operates as an online corporate store for Marriott Corporation operated by his great-great- grandson Thomas Montgomery Marriott.

Distribution and description  While usually not a common species, Diospyros abyssinica is widespread in Africa, ranging from Guinea to Eritrea, southwards to the area covered by the Flora Zambesiaca, and Angola. The species is a large tree with a relatively sparse and shortly branched crown. Like other Diospyros, it is an evergreen species. The leaves are alternating, oblong-elliptic, and glossy dark green. Their margin is entire and often wavy. The young leaves are distinctly red. Flowers are small, growing axillary, and are found to be solitary or in few-flowered clusters. They have a creamy-white to yellow colour. The fruit is fleshy, spherical, and held in a lobed cup. It is a yellowish-green colour, turning blue-black when ripe.  Uses  The fruit are consumed by birds and various mammals, and are an important part of the diet of primates and fruitbats. Records of human consumption is lacking, but the sweet mesocarp under the tough epicarp might likely also be consumed by the local population, as in other African Diospyros species. Besides the varied use of its hard and moderately heavy wood, which is lacking the dark colour and high durability of other Diospyros species, D. abyssinica is said to have medical properties.Plant Resources of Tropical Africa (PROTA): Diospyros abyssinica (Hiern) F.White Few studies of the traditional use of D. abyssinica have however been done. The tree is considered to be a traditional medicine by the Malian people of Sikasso region, and is used for treatments of various diseases. The Dio√Øla cercle uses the decoction of leaves against malaria, and wound healing, while the roots are used against dysentery. The extraction of the root bark is attractive to scavengers and some 15 lipoxygenase inhibitors have been found. The attraction is caused by phenolic smell of bergenin and flavanol that the plant releases. It also releases betulinic acid and lupeol from the stem bark. All of those compounds are used as anti-inflammatory, and are protecting plants from protozoan parasites. The plants are also effective against blood platelet aggregation and murine tumors.

Coachbuilding operations utilised a variety of chassis, including Rolls-Royce and the then Cricklewood-based Bentley Motors, and at least one Bugatti Type 30. and a type 40 (chassis # 40470). However, due to the resultant volume of orders many of the projects were subcontracted to other coachworks, in particular Abbey Coachworks of Merton. Post-WW2, having acted as a shadow factory during hostilities, the company continued as a car dealership. Today the 1937 art-deco inspired building with clock tower has been demolished, and the former site has been redeveloped and is presently used by a Peugeot cars dealership. Jappic Designed by H.M.

A three-speed gearbox used a chain-drive to the rear axle, with only the rear live axle equipped with brakes, with all four wheels using 650x65 motorcycle tyres. Weighing in at only and costing just ¬£150 to buy, the car was aimed at competing in the holiday-handicap races. After Walters broke the Class J flying mile record in the car at a speed of , it was subsequently advertised being able to lap Brooklands at over . Jarvis had planned to commercially produce the small racing car, but as the venture never took off commercially, they tried to re-market the vehicle again in 1926 with a larger 495cc JAP engine. But again the venture failed, and so in late 1926 they sold the sole prototype vehicle to noted WW1 ambulance driver and then racing driver Mrs Gwenda Stewart. Under copyright agreement with JAP/Walters/Jarvis, she had to change the name to Hawkes-Stewart, and then retro-fitted the vehicle with an original 344cc engine. It never raced again, and was destroyed by a fire at the Autodrome de Linas-Montlh√©ry in 1932. Racing cars Sir Malcolm Campbell at the wheel of the original bodied Napier-Campbell Blue Bird at Pendine Sands, Wales in January 1927 Jarvis built a reputation for building a number of successful, aerodynamic design concept bodies, for a number of well-known 1920s racing drivers. At the start of the 1924 season Woolf Barnato swapped his racing Wolseley Racing Moth for an eight-litre Hispano-Suiza H6C, which he commissioned Jarvis to build a suitable racing body for. Barnato then established an eight-litre class racing record for the car. In late 1924 he obtained a prototype Bentley 3 Litre chassis, which was subsequently fitted with a boat-tail body by Jarvis for a cost of ¬£400. Partnered in 1925 by John Duff, Barnato used the car to win several major Brooklands races, and set a new 3 Litre 24-hour record averaging in 1925.https://www.classicdriver.com/en/article/classic-life/woolf-babe-barnato- gentleman-driver Barnato continued to race the Jarvis-bodied Bentley into 1926, in which he obtained a first and a second at the Easter 1926 BARC races, but then unexpectedly sold it to J.

However, having modified his land speed record car Babs over the winter, Parry-Thomas was killed in Babs at Pendine Sands, Wales on 3 March 1927. His estate sold the car, and it then next competed in the 1928 season equipped with a Parry Thomas frontal cowling, driven by Dudley Froy. The noted racing driver and later World land speed record holder Sir Malcolm Campbell had both his own garage at the Brooklands racing circuit, as well as a motor dealership, Bluebird Garage on Chelsea's fashionable King's Road. After he took on the new franchise of selling American-built Chrysler Corporation vehicles from 1925, he commissioned his regular racing mechanic Leo Villa to take a Chrysler Model 70 chassis (actually a re-badged Maxwell automobile design), and build him a new racing car under the guises of a marketing exercise. Villa reworked the chassis and engine, and then commissioned Jarvis to build a suitable aerodynamic body. Driven by Campbell, the original Chrysler Bluebird won the Short Handicap at Brooklands on 12 September 1925, at an average speed of . In the same year, having realised that his Sunbeam car would then quickly restrict his world record speed attempts above , Campbell commissioned C. Amherst Villiers at the Robin Hood Engineering Works in Putney Vale to build the first of his Bluebird record breaking cars. Taking two years to construct under the supervision of Villa, the Napier-Campbell Blue Bird was designed by Villiers to reach . The 1927 original version contained a Napier Lion aero engine within a custom-design chassis, encased in an aerodynamic body co-designed and then built by Jarvis. In its later second and third guises, Villers improved the aerodynamic efficiency of the Jarvis body work within a wind tunnel. In the 1930s, Jarvis were a main sponsor of the EX-type Magic Midget's record breaking cars.

Mescalero Apache Tribe, 462 U.S. 324 (1983), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that the application of New Mexico's laws to on-reservation hunting and fishing by nonmembers of the Tribe is preempted by the operation of federal law.New Mexico v. Mescalero Apache Tribe, . Background The Mescalero Apache Tribe is a Native American (Indian) tribe with a reservation in south central New Mexico in the Rocky Mountains, generally south of Ruidoso and west of Tularosa. The current reservation was established by a series of Executive Orders, with the most recent dating from 1883. The tribe is governed by the Indian Reorganization Act,Indian Reorganization Act, , et seq which provided for self-government of the tribe and reservation, subject to approval by the Secretary of the Interior. The tribe's major source of income, lumber, was in decline and the tribe started looking at other sources of income. These included a casino resort complex, Inn of the Mountain Gods, a ski resort, Ski Apache, and development of fish and game resources. All of these programs provided revenue for the tribal government to provide services to tribal members. In the hunting and fishing areas, the tribe entered into a sustained collaborative effort with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. This included creating eight lakes, stocking the lakes with fish, and the federal government operating a hatchery on the reservation. The state was not involved in these efforts. The federal government also provided a herd of 142 elk, which the tribe's game management program has increased to 1,200. New Mexico was not involved in these efforts, nor of the other game on the reservation. The tribe and the federal government jointly conduct a fish and game management program. Every year the tribe adopts hunting and fishing ordinances based on the recommendations of the federal government. These ordinances are then approved by the Interior Secretary. The state of New Mexico also has hunting and fishing regulations. The two sets of regulations are often in conflict as regards to the hunting seasons, bag limits, and the fact that the tribe does not require a state license to hunt tribal lands, regardless of whether the individual is an Indian or non-Indian. In 1977, the New Mexico Department of Game and Fish began to enforce state game laws by arresting non-Indian hunters for illegal possession of game that was taken from the reservation in accordance with tribal laws, but that were not in compliance with state law. Lower courts The tribe then filed suit against the State of New Mexico in the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico to prevent New Mexico from enforcing state hunting and fishing regulations on the reservation. The District Court granted declaratory relief and granted the tribe an injunction preventing the state from enforcing its regulations. The state then appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, which affirmed the decision of the District Court. The state appealed to the Supreme Court, which vacated the decision of the Tenth Circuit and remanded the case for reconsideration in view of the Supreme Court's decision in Montana v. United States, . On remand, the Tenth Circuit again affirmed the decision of the District Court, which was a victory for the tribe. The state again appealed to the Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the appeal by granting certiorari. Opinion of the Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, author of the majority opinion Justice Marshall delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court. Marshall first distinguished the case before the court from the facts and decision in Montana v. United States, noting that non-tribal lands were interspersed with tribal lands in the Montana case and that the ruling in that case turned on whether the Crow Tribe could regulate hunting that was within reservation boundaries but not on tribal land. He then discussed the concept of tribal sovereignty and its history from Worcester v. Georgia, to more modern decisions. Marshall noted that although there are some cases where a state may regulate non-Indians on a reservation, it may only do so if it is not preempted by federal law. Marshall noted that New Mexico conceded that the tribe had the authority to regulate hunting and fishing for both tribal and non-tribal members on reservation land, but claimed concurrent jurisdiction over the non-tribal members. Marshall observed that Public Law 280 specifically granted tribes the authority to regulate on-reservation hunting and fishing, and made it a federal crime to enter a reservation to hunt or fish without the consent of the tribe. Marshall rejected the state's claim of concurrent jurisdiction, noting that the state could \\"effectively nullify\\" tribal authority. Based in large part on the BIA involvement with the tribe in establishing regulations, Marshall held that federal law preempted state law and affirmed the decision of the Tenth Circuit Court.

Fishing starts in mid- to late-March, when hordes of white perch move upriver from deep holes downstream where they wintered.

Generations of Marylanders and Virginians have converged on the Potomac around Fletcher's each spring to dip-net herring and shad, extract the roe and salt-cure the flesh, though the practice has declined in the last 25 years. Finally, the river in late April and into May teems with spawning striped bass, locally known as rockfish, which attract another wave of anglers keen to catch a trophy up to 50 pounds\\", said Joe Fletcher in 20044.

Plot PART ONE After being falsely accused of a crime he never committed, Pastor David Robinson is shipped off to a penal colony to serve out an eight-year sentence. His wife Lara and their four children (seventeen-year-old Ernst, fifteen-year- old Fritz, ten-year-old Sarah, and nine-year-old Jacob) are allowed to accompany him. After several days at sea, a raging storm strikes the ship and the captain is killed by a fallen mast while trying to restore order to his terrified crew. Under the orders of the ruthless second-in-command Thomas Blunt and his fellow officers Pickles and Roberts, most of the crew members are forced to abandon ship, while the Robinson family are trapped below deck. During the confusion, Jacob gets separated from his family and is carried out to sea on a lifeboat carrying Blunt, Pickles, and several other members of the crew. The ship strikes against some rocks and gets stuck fast, leaving David, Lara, and their remaining three children (Ernst, Fritz, and Sarah) stranded on board. The next day, the Robinson family gets off the ship and swims to a nearby island, where they are forced to rely on coconuts for food and rainwater to quench their thirst. Fritz and Ernst are sent to scour the coves on the shores for any sign of the launches, but they are unable to spot them and discover that they are too far away from any available land in sight. While returning to the beach to regroup with their parents and sister, the two boys are chased by a wild boar and Ernst ends up dislocating his shoulder. Upon learning from his sons that they failed to find the launches and discovered that they are stranded on a desert island, David informs his family that they must work together to survive. David, Fritz, and Ernst return to the ship the following day and begin salvaging as much as they can find on board, including a few muskets, several barrels of gunpowder and shot, a chest of tools, rope, clothes, books, and other valuable supplies. They also find two crates of chickens as a reliable source of meat and eggs, and they also rescue two dogs that they found trapped in the captain‚Äôs cabin. After bringing their supplies and animals back to shore, the Robinson family learn how to survive on their own. They discover and harvest various fruits and vegetables, build a tent for shelter, and even capture a young buffalo to tame and train to help them with pulling heavy timber for their shelter. One morning, Sarah spots an English frigate in the distance and informs her family of her discovery. David and Ernst suggest that they bring some more supplies from the wrecked ship in case they fail to signal the English ship, but Lara and Fritz inform them that they must destroy the ship to attract the attention of the ship‚Äôs crew if they ever have the chance of being rescued. Begrudgingly, David swims over to the wreckage and blows up the ship in the hope of signaling the English frigate, but the desperate attempt fails and the explosion destroys the remaining supplies that the Robinsons could have salvaged in order to survive. Limited to the few supplies and tools they managed to salvage from the ship, the Robinson family proceed to build a new home up in the trees. One day, Sarah meets and befriends a local native named Namatiti, but is dragged away by her father and scolded for putting herself in mortal danger. Angry at their father for passing poor judgment on Namatiti and being selfish for his own reasons, Fritz and Sarah reject their father and Fritz goes with the native in his boat. Fritz and Namatiti travel to the opposite side of the island, catch an abundant supply of fish, and also uncover a small supply of gold coins from the wreckage of a ship that sunk to the bottom of the shallows. They return to the Robinson family‚Äôs camp a few days later, only to learn from David and Ernst that Lara had been bitten by a snake while protecting her daughter from the deadly serpent. Sarah informs her father and brothers that it was black with yellow stripes, which Ernst identifies as a venomous banded krait, or Bungarus fasciatus. Desperate to save his wife from dying of snakebite, David sends his sons and Namatiti into the rainforest to bring back some medicinal herbs and roots. Using the herbs and roots they collected, Namatiti tends to Lara‚Äôs snakebite and successfully heals her. Lara slowly recovers from the snakebite and the entire Robinson family expresses their gratitude for Namatiti, who pledges his friendship to them in return. The family then goes for a swim in a lagoon that they found during their exploration of the island. Meanwhile, Jacob Robinson, along with Blunt, Pickles, and the few survivors of the convict ship are picked up by a Malay trading ship and nursed back to health. Over the next several days, Blunt takes Jacob under his wing and the boy begins to look upon the ruthless Blunt as a father figure. However, Jacob witnessed Blunt silently murder the Malaysian captain and throw him overboard and is nervous about what he saw. With Pickles and Roberts to back him up, Blunt takes command of the ship‚Äôs crew and even proclaims that they will raid English ships that they encounter at sea. From that moment onward, Blunt, Jacob, Pickles, Roberts, and the Malaysian crew members become pirates and dangerous enemies to the British Empire. PART TWO Seven years have passed and Blunt and his pirate crew have successfully made war with the English navy. Jacob, now sixteen years old, has become a loyal follower of Blunt and a cunning member of the pirate crew. During one of their night raids on an English frigate, Jacob's pirates successfully kidnap twenty-year-old Emily Montrose, the beautiful daughter of a sea-captain. Captain Montrose swears that he will hang Blunt and his men if they ever harm his daughter before promising Emily that he will rescue her. Emily spends several days in captivity on board Blunt‚Äôs ship, but only sees Captain Blunt and Pickles in person several times. During a brawl between Jacob and Pickles which distracts the captain and the rest of the crew, Emily escapes from the ship and swims to a nearby island which, unbeknownst to her, is the home of the stranded Robinson family. Meanwhile, the Robinson family has successfully established an island paradise for themselves which also become a self-sustaining farm and plantation. They have managed to build a small number of houses up in the trees, a water wheel that supplies them with water for drinking, cooking, and washing, and a collection of post fences that help pen up their animals and fence in their gardens and orchards. In addition to their buffalo, dogs, and chickens, the Robinsons have also added goats, honeybees, and a pet monkey to their menagerie of animals. They have successfully planted numerous crops which give them fruits and vegetables to last them all year round. David and Lara‚Äôs three children have also grown up into young, respectful, and hard- working adults, with Ernst now twenty-four, Fritz twenty-two, and Sarah eighteen years old. One day, David sends Fritz and Ernst to the opposite side of the island to bring some more kale and lettuce to replenish their dwindling supply of edible greens. The two brothers discover a pirate ship near the cove and hide out of sight as they watch a rowboat carrying six armed pirates rowing back to the ship. Shortly afterwards, they find and rescue Emily Montrose, who has successfully escaped and hidden from the pirates on the island. They take her back to their home and introduce her to their parents and Sarah, who bring her into their tree house and slowly nurse her back to health. Ernst and Fritz then proceed to tell their parents and sister about the pirates and how Emily's father has been chasing them for months. Fearing that the pirates will arrive at their island first before Captain Montrose does, David informs his family that they must make preparations to fight the pirates when they arrive. They rebuild the signal fire they had put up on the highest point of the island years prior, and set up a line of defenses around the hilltop should the pirates chase them up there. They make several rockets out of some of the spare gunpowder they had salvaged from the convict ship years earlier, and keep their guns loaded to defend themselves. Over the next few weeks, Emily soon becomes a love interest with Fritz and Ernst. She is soon accepted into the family and is loved and respected by everyone. She soon meets Namatiti when he arrives at the island to visit the Robinsons, and though nervous about him at first, Emily soon realizes that the native is a loyal, respectful friend of the family who has taken such good care of her. One afternoon, Fritz and Emily go for a swim in the lagoon together. Fritz then hesitantly swims up to Emily and kisses her. He then kisses her again, but Emily pushes him away and tells him that she's getting out of the water. Fritz tries to reconcile with Emily for his behavior, but she rejects him, getting out of the water and walking away. Rejected and heartbroken, a depressed Fritz shuns himself away from the rest of the family and no longer goes near or speaks to Emily, even though he watches her from a good distance away as she talks and laughs with the rest of the family. Over the next few days, Fritz's behavior is soon noticed by Lara, who goes to him one afternoon and asks him what is wrong. He tells his mother that he hates the island and wishes to leave it, even though Lara points out that she thought he was the happiest to live on the island. She points out to Fritz that Emily was looking for him down at the cove earlier that day, hoping that he would like to go swimming with her again, but Fritz declines and angrily states that Emily has Ernst to swim with. Lara soon learns about what had happened the last time Fritz and Emily were together and begs her son to give Emily time to adjust and to be patient with her, but Fritz doesn't believe her and tells her that she doesn't understand how he feels at the moment. After a little more kindly advice which cheers him up a little, Fritz apologizes for his past behavior and Lara forgives him. Meanwhile, Namatiti returns to his native village, only to discover that Thomas Blunt and his pirate crew have arrived in search of treasure. They capture Namatiti and hold him hostage, threatening to massacre his tribe and burn the village if he doesn‚Äôt take them to the treasure at once. He takes the pirates to the shipwreck where he and Fritz had uncovered the small supply of gold coins seven years earlier, but the pirates find no treasure. The next morning, Namatiti breaks free of his bonds and escaped from his captors. Enraged at having lost their hostage, Blunt and his crew sail down to the island where the Robinsons were dwelling, but unbeknownst to them, Namatiti follows them to the island. The pirates soon arrive at the Robinson family‚Äôs home, where they tie up the dogs and proceed onto where they encounter the Robinson family preparing to enjoy an afternoon meal. Blunt is surprised when he discovers that Pastor Robinson and his family had survived all those past seven years, just as much as the Robinson family are when they recognize Blunt, Pickles, and Roberts have survived the fury of the storm. David and Lara are both shocked and devastated when they meet their long-lost son Jacob alive and standing before them as a young man, but also as a ruthless member of Blunt‚Äôs pirate crew. Roberts finds Emily and drags her out to reveal her to Blunt, but a furious Fritz orders Roberts to leave her alone and punches him when he goads him. Blunt calmly informs the Robinson family that he and his men are not savages and wish for food and drink, which Lara reluctantly agrees that they shall have. For the next two days, Blunt and his pirate crew remain in the Robinsons‚Äô home and order them around as if they were their servants. Lara and David give Blunt and his men the gold that Fritz and Namatiti had found in the shipwreck years prior, hoping that they would leave now that they had gotten their money, but Blunt and his men refuse to leave just yet. Lara and David watch helplessly as Jacob stays with the pirates under Captain Blunt‚Äôs watchful eye, knowing full well that Blunt gives Jacob little choice between remaining true to his family or the pirates. One morning, David discovers an English warship far off in the distance and quietly informs Lara, Fritz, Ernst, Sarah, and Emily of his discovery. They quietly slip away into the jungle and make their way up the hill to where they had set up their defenses and the signal fire. The pirates soon learn of the approaching English warship and also discover that the Robinsons were making their way up to the hilltop, so they pursue the Robinsons in the hopes of taking them hostage and preventing them from lighting the signal fire. Armed with their muskets and makeshift rockets, as well as rolling logs and barrels down the hillside, the Robinsons struggle to repel Blunt‚Äôs pirate crew as they ascend the hillside. A battle ensues between the Robinsons and the pirates, in which several of Blunt‚Äôs men are killed or wounded. During the battle, Jacob tries to stop the pirates from attempting to kill his family, but he is stunned by one of the exploding rockets fired by Sarah and is dragged away to safety by Blunt. Fritz manages to light the signal fire with a makeshift stick of dynamite, which draws the attention of the crew on board the English warship who start firing their cannons at the pirates on the hill. Blunt orders for his men to fall back to the boats, in which he, Pickles, Roberts, Jacob, and three other pirates retreat down the hill to the beaches. The surviving pirates reach the boats and attempt to board them in their desperation to escape, but Blunt refuses to leave without the gold he had left behind at the Robinsons' treehouse. Jacob also refuses to leave the island without the captain, so he jumps off the rowboat and goes after him while Roberts, Pickles, and the few remaining pirates escape back to their ship for safety. Blunt retrieves the gold coins he finds and prepares to burn down the Robinsons' home, but David, Fritz, and Jacob arrive in time to stop him just as he sets one of the houses on fire. In the struggle that follows, Blunt shoots and wounds Fritz, Jacob is pushed off the bridge by Blunt, and David and Blunt struggle desperately in an attempt to overpower one or the other. Lara and Emily tend to a wounded Fritz, while Ernst and Sarah struggle to put out the fire that Blunt had started before it can spread to the rest of their home. Just as Blunt overpowers David and draws his sword to finish him off, Namatiti hurls a spear at the pirate captain and mortally wounds him as his spear pierces him in the stomach. As Blunt lay dying, David tries to convince him to grip his hand and submit to the will of God in order to save himself. Blunt refuses, stating that he should have listened to Jacob and left with his crew instead of staying behind for the gold, as well as the fact that he is more fortunate to die than to fall into the hands of the British authorities. Blunt dies in David's arms, and Jacob mourns the loss of a man who had watched over him for seven years before he and his mother Lara embrace at long last. With Captain Thomas Blunt dead and the pirates killed or driven off, Emily is reunited with her father and tells him everything that had happened. Captain Montrose informs David Robinson that even though the English authorities back in England see him as a felon, Captain Montrose sees him as the man who has saved his daughter from a living death. He informs David that his seven years on the island would be sentence and promises him that he will do what he can to argue his case before the authorities and grant him his freedom. Lara is greatly relieved that her youngest son Jacob has been returned to her family and that her husband would soon regain his freedom at last. Sarah comforts Namatiti as he cleans his bloodstained dagger in the ocean's water and thanks him for helping them in their fight against Blunt and his pirate crew. Fritz goes off later that afternoon to find Emily and speak to her again, only to discover her and Ernst talking about returning to England together. The next day, as Fritz is in the middle of mending the fishing nets, Emily goes to him to speak to him again, but he admits to see her with Ernst the day before. Emily asks him what he sees with his heart and not his eyes, to which he replies that he sees Safety Cove which gave him and his family water, fish, and life. He also admits his feelings to Emily, to which Emily forgives Fritz for his past behavior and also admits to Fritz that she had fallen in love with him since she first saw him. Jacob also gives to Sarah her doll Isabelle, which he had kept for the past seven years so that he would never forget his family, and the two of them embrace happily. Captain Montrose, David, and Lara gather their children together and announce to them what they had been discussing earlier that morning. It was agreed that Lara and David would spend the rest of their days on the island, while some of Captain Montrose's men will remain behind on the island to help them set up a trading post. Lara admitted that though she had high hopes of leaving the island, she realizes that she was happiest the most to stay on the island with her husband. David also informed his four children that they have a chance to accompany Captain Montrose back to England and explore different parts of the world, as well as meet other people, study, and settle down to marry and have families of their own. Ernst decides to accompany Captain Montrose back to England to study at a university, while Fritz volunteers to stay on the island and help his parents and Captain Montrose' men set up their new trading post. David states that Fritz is always stubborn and disobedient, but Emily promises David and his wife that she will make sure that Friz learns obedience. She and Fritz kiss, indicating that they have decided to stay on the island and get married much to the delight of Captain Montrose and the other Robinsons. David calls for a toast, to which he, Lara, Jacob, Sarah, Fritz, Ernst, Emily, and Captain Montrose propose to each others' families. Namatiti, who loads up his boat with supplies given to him by the Robinsons, looks back one last time and smiles with satisfaction at the happiness and content of the Robinsons and Montroses before he climbs into his boat and rows away back to his village.

Luckily, Stranded crafts a much deeper story that should please both adults and older kids. Strong acting and well-fleshed characters make this lengthy Hallmark miniseries a worthwhile disc. If you give it a chance, this engaging tale of survival may surprise you\\". Film Critic's Christopher Null gave four and a half stars (out of five) saying, \\"Hallmark has imbued Stranded with the appearance of big budget effects and an authenticity much like Cast Away, and though the Robinsons always had it easy compared to Hanks and Mr. Crusoe (thanks to the ship full of supplies which ran aground on the island with them), their adventure is thankfully, finally, made worth watching\\".

He went undrafted in the 2012 NFL Draft, and was signed by the Chicago Bears after the draft. He played college at Troy. He was also a member of the Cleveland Browns. Early life Brown was born on November 30, 1988 in Chicago, Illinois, to Paulina Harness and Ellis Jackson. Brown has three siblings: Ellis Ray Magee, Joseph Harness, and Elaine Brown. He attended Amite County High School in Liberty, Mississippi, where he was teammates with Gabe Jackson. Brown started playing football in eighth grade, and said that football saved his life in 2004, when he opted to workout instead of visiting family, where a cousin of his and a friend were involved in an altercation that later led to them being sentenced to death. At Amite County, Brown was a two-way lineman. As a freshman, he was named Amite County's Rookie of the Year. He also won 2005 Mississippi state weightlifting championship in 2005. In his sophomore year, he earned Defensive Player of the Year after recording 103 tackles and 14 sacks on the season. After he had a class 2A high 108 pancake blocks in his junior year, he was an All-State selection, and repeated in his senior year. Regarded as a two-star recruit by Rivals.com, Brown was not ranked among the top offensive lineman prospects of his class.Rivals.com Profile He initially drew interest from Mississippi and Louisiana State, but that began to fade when his academic struggles became clear. On National Signing Day 2008, Brown chose to attend Southern Mississippi, over offers from Alcorn State, Arkansas State, and Jackson State, but never managed to meet the qualification standards. Instead, he had to opt for the junior college route. College career Before enrolling at Troy University, Brown played at Southwest Mississippi Community College, and was eventually named to the second-team All-Mississippi Junior College team in his sophomore year. In his three seasons at Troy, Brown excelled, with 66 pancakes in 13 games in 2009. However, he also led the team with 9 penalties, as well as allowing 3.5 sacks. His best performance that year was in a victory over Florida Atlantic when he recorded a season-high 13 pancakes. Before the 2011 season, Brown was placed on the Outland Trophy watchlist, making him only one of just 10 players on the watch list from non-automatic qualifying programs in the FBS, as well as being the only player from the Sun Belt Conference included on the list. He was later invited to the 2012 Senior Bowl. He majored in Criminal Justice. Professional career Brown was projected as a mid-round pick, being named the 54th best player in the draft by Mel Kiper and the 93rd best by Pro Football Weekly. Despite his athleticism, Brown wasn't drafted in the 2012 NFL Draft, and was named by Scouts and NFL analyst Gil Brandt as the second-best undrafted free agent. Analysts believed that Brown's use of marijuana was a factor of him being undrafted, along with concerns about his speed and strength. Brown was ultimately signed by the Chicago Bears along with 10 others. During rookie minicamps, Brown stood out and impressed Bears head coach Lovie Smith. Smith commented on Brown, stating \\"He has stood out in the drills. You notice him. He's slim, athletic, good size, smile on his face and he was a pretty good player in college. However (he went undrafted), we're just glad he's in our camp.\\" He was released on August 31. He was eventually assigned to the practice squad. On November 21, Brown was elevated to the active roster after Chilo Rachal left the team. The Bears waived Brown on August 26, 2014.Chicago Bears on Twitter: #Bears have reached NFL's 75-man roster limit by waiving T/G James Brown and CB Isaiah Frey.

The initiative was formally launched in 1998 by then-Communist Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin, and its name refers to the need to ‚Äústress study, stress politics, stress righteousness‚Äù (jiang xuexi, jiang zhengzhi, jiang zhengqi). The campaign was intended to strengthen discipline within the Communist Party and consolidate support for Jiang Zemin.Jia Hepeng, ‚ÄòThe Three Represents Campaign: Reform the Party of Indoctrinate the Capitalists?‚Äô , The Cato Journal (2004). During the campaign, which spanned from late 1998 to 2000, senior staff within the government, military, party offices, universities, and state and private enterprises were required to spend several weeks engaging in political study and self-criticism sessions with the goal of improving unity and enhancing loyalty to the Communist Party.Erik Eckholm, Likely to Be a Best Seller in China: It's No Mystery, New York Times, 1 June 2000. According to a retired official cited in the New York Times, Jiang also hoped to use the campaign to \\"identify loyal, promising officials for future leadership positions.\\" The initiative was only the second major party rectification campaigns launched since the death of Mao Zedong (the previous campaign having begun in 1983).Joseph Fewsmith, ‚ÄúCCP Launches Campaign to Maintain the Advanced Nature of Party Members‚Äù, China Leadership Monitor, No. 13. Background China‚Äôs embrace of a market economy and the dismantling of the Marxist‚ÄìLeninist system in the 1980s and 1990s precipitated a deterioration in ideological unity and purpose within the Communist Party. Moreover, the party was facing a variety of internal and external challenges, including but not limited to growing crime and corruption, income disparities, weakening central government control, and calls for political liberalization. In order to address these challenges, the Communist Party leadership under Jiang Zemin sought to adapt and redefine the official ideology to meet changing circumstances, while stressing the continued importance of loyalty to party. Andrew Nathan and Bruce Gilley write that the campaign served another purpose: if Jiang Zemin wished to have a lasting impact on the Communist Party itself, ‚Äúhe had to come forward with a new conception of its mandate and its basis for action.‚Äù To that end, Jiang enunciated a number of new approaches and slogans in the early and mid-1990s.Andrew Nathan and Bruce Gilley, ‚ÄúChina's New Rulers: The Secret Files,‚Äù (New York, NY: New York Review Books, 2003), pp 190 - 192. The earliest proposals for the Three Stresses campaign emerged in 1995, when Jiang began proposed an ideological rectification campaign urging party leaders to ‚Äústress politics.‚Äù The idea initially met with opposition within the party; Qiao Shi and Li Ruihuan, in particular, viewed the proposal as a means of self-aggrandizement. In 1998, following the forced retirement of Qiao Shi, Jiang proceeded to roll out the three stresses campaign, which leadership hoped would stave off atrophy and decay within the party. The campaign In October 1998, Jiang Zemin, with assistance from then-executive secretary of the Secretariat Hu Jintao and chief of staff Zeng Qinghong announced plans for the Three Stresses campaign to the Politburo. In December of the same year, Hu Jintao publicly launched the campaign with an appearance on television, in which he urged party members to write self-criticisms and participate in work meetings to discuss their methods of carrying out their work. Party members were also encouraged to go to the countryside to promote the campaign. During its initial phase, the Three Stresses campaign was carried out within the army, government agencies and Communist Party offices. Thereafter, senior staff within publishing houses, universities, research organizations, and state-owned enterprises were also enjoined to participate in political study sessions.Erik Eckholm, Repeat After Him: The Party Isn't Over, New York Times, 2 May 1999. In addition to studying the writings of Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin, senior staff within workplaces were required to write critiques of both their own political failings, and criticisms of their superiors and workplaces. Although the campaign employed techniques of ideological study and self-criticism reminiscent of the Mao era, the sessions were described as comparatively tame. Writing for the Far Eastern Economic Review, Susan Lawrence described the impact of the Three Stresses campaign on the country's corporate sector. The account told of how, in the summer of 1999, senior staff at a major bank were required to participate in dozens of group meetings \\"in which they have criticized their own and each other's political failings,\\" draft self-criticism papers, in addition to conducting nearly 100 individual political sessions. The objective of the campaign was described as improving the unity of senior staff and ensuring their loyalty to the Communist Party and Jiang Zemin.Susan V. Lawrence, China: Stressful Summer, Far Eastern Economic Review, 19 August 1999. Reception Views on the Three Stresses campaign within the Communist Party leadership were deeply divided, and several senior officials viewed the campaign as an attempt by Jiang Zemin to enhance his own prestige. Li Ruihuan and Qiao Shi continued to oppose the campaign, with the latter describing it as an attempt to erect a personality cult around Jiang. Politburo member Tian Jiyun called the campaign a \\"joke\\", and expressed doubt that it could have the intended effect of enhancing discipline within the party. The criticisms led Jiang to 'clarify' during a March 2000 Politburo meeting that he had no intention using the Three Stresses to enhance his personal authority, and that it was intended purely to \\"rectify the Party's work style and purify the ranks of the Party's leading cadres.\\" Premier Zhu Rongji and National People's Congress Chairman Li Peng were reportedly ambivalent towards the initiative. However, a number of rising young leaders within the Communist Party embraced the initiative as a means of gaining favor with Jiang. Among them were Hu Jintao, Wen Jiabao, Li Changchun, Bo Xilai, and Jia Qinglin.

The village is one of the few in Maine's inland areas to be settled in the second half of the 18th century, and has a significant concentration of 18th-century residences. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Description and history The town of New Gloucester is located in northern Cumberland County, northwest of the coastal communities of Freeport and Brunswick. It was chartered in 1735, and first settled in 1742. When King George's War broke out in 1744, it was abandoned because of Native American attacks, and was not resettled until 1753. Its first wood frame house, built in 1761 by Isaac Parsons, still stands in the village center. The town was incorporated in 1794, and has always been a predominantly rural agricultural community. The town center is a rural, dispersed village, centered at the junction Maine State Route 231 with Gloucester Hill Road and Cobbs Bridge Road. SR 231 roughly follows the first major route to the coast, joining the village to Yarmouth in 1756. Stretched along these roads are a significant number of wood frame houses, many of them built before 1810 and exhibiting Georgian or Federal styling. Also included are a 1782 tavern, the town's first cemetery, and the site of a blockhouse (now marked by a reduced-size replica) built following the town's resettlement in 1753. Public buildings in the district are generally of later construction, including the 1838 Greek Revival Congregational Church (built on the site of the town's first church), and its town hall, library, and first high school, all built around the turn of the 20th century.

It is a means whereby humankind secures wildlife in a favourable condition for contemplation, education or research, in perpetuity. It is an important topic in cultural ecology, where conservation management counterbalances the unchecked exploitative management of natural resources. Conservation management systems are vital for turning sustainable development strategies into successful operations. In New Zealand the Department of Conservation develops conservation management strategies in conjunction with the community as a means of prioritising conservation issues. Conservation management has historically adopted ideals deriving from 3 discursive approaches: the classic approach, populist approach, and neoliberal approach. All three approaches have differing ideas about the nexus of conservation and development and their potential interactions. * The Classic Approach understands local people to be a threat to environmental conservation and therefore people occupying landed intended for conservation have historically and presently been evicted from their land. * The Populist Approach understands that conservation requires the participation and the empowerment of local people in order to reach both social and environmental aims. * The Neoliberal Approach sees the need for value to be placed on biodiversity in order for conservation to be incorporated in the economic systems and be successful as a tool of economic development.Brown, K. (2002). Innovations for Conservation and Development. The Geographical Journal,168(1), 6-17. Retrieved from https://www.jstor.org/stable/3451218 National Parks are heavily managed conservation areas. The approach adopted by a conservation authority will influence the management of a Park and dictate how the park authorities view the role of the park and the relationship visitors may have with it. An example of a park adopting a populist approach is the Rouge National Urban Park located in Canada‚Äôs largest city Toronto. Though controlled by the Government of Canada through Parks Canada, the Rouge National Urban Park encourages the community to access the park to learn, play and live. The complexity of the Park being in a large metropolitan city has meant that Parks Canada has incorporated the surrounding communities into the planning, implementation, and management of the park.

The band released their debut album on May 8, 2012. History=Formation and debut album (2011‚Äì2012) Royal Southern Brotherhood came together in New Orleans, Louisiana during 2011. Reuben Williams, manager to both Neville and Zito, had the idea for the band. The two had collaborated on \\"Pearl River\\", the title track for Zito's 2009 album, and it went on to win the Blues Music Award ‚ÄúSong of the Year‚Äù. Zito suggested Devon Allman, who was skeptical of the supergroup idea at first. According to Allman when his manager broached the subject he replied \\"Dude are you crazy? Thats like putting five quarterbacks in a room and saying 'go play football'. What the Hell are you talking about?\\" However, Allman thought it over and decided he liked the concept. Allman and Zito were old acquaintances, having been friendly musical rivals in the St. Louis, Missouri music scene and had worked together managing a Guitar Center store in 1999. According to Allman, ‚Äúwe went from talking about the idea, to me and Cyril writing a tune over email, to being in rehearsals, all in two months.‚Äù With the union of the three noted front men, the group next added bassist Wooton and drummer Scott to form the rhythm section. One unique aspect of the band is the wide difference in ages. At 37, Allman is the youngest while 63-year-old Cyril Neville is the eldest. Said Allman of the group:\\"It's like it was meant to be. We're not really reinventing the wheel here. We're just making sure it keeps rolling. I think certain fans out there really have an affinity for music based in soul and blues and rock, classic rock, so you really get that with this band.\\" The group made its stage debut in September 2011 at the Rock ‚Äôn‚Äô Bowl in New Orleans. In December 2011, the band recorded songs for their debut album over five days at Dockside Studio, a 12-acre estate on the banks of Vermilion Bayou, in Maurice, Louisiana. In the spring of 2012, they gathered to rehearse for their tour, at Don Odell‚Äôs Legends Studio in Palmer, Massachusetts. While in Palmer, they also taped a segment for the \\"Legends\\" TV program distributed through public-access cable stations. As of September, 2012 the band had made extensive tour stops across the United States and in fourteen foreign countries. Reception The band's self-titled first album was released on May 8, 2012. It debuted at number five on the Billboard Blues chart, and number thirty on the Heatseekers album chart, which includes all music genres. In reviewing the album for The Boston Globe, critic Scott McLennan said: \\"Royal Southern Brotherhood is neither brilliant turn nor crazy risk for the five musicians involved - it‚Äôs both\\" and the band '\\"is creating music that is simultaneously progressive and traditional - rock, blues, and funk flow freely - yet sounds distinct from their individual repertoires, so all involved are taking a chance.\\" The Blues Rock Review gave the album an eight out of ten, stating the band ...crowns a new age of southern rock, forming quite the super group of blues‚Äêinfused artists.. and the band come straight out of the gate and hit the ground running with their debut. If one thing is certain, these guys know how to create inspirational music, offering a full package of talented musicians who come together effortlessly as if it were only a matter of time. In 2013, Royal Southern Brotherhood was nominated for a Blues Music Award in the 'Rock Blues Album' category. In 2014, they won for a Blues Music Award in the 'DVD of the Year' category for Songs From The Road. In October that year, Mike Zito left the band and Nashville guitarist Bart Walker joined. In April 2014 Allman played his final show with Royal Southern Brotherhood at the Wanee Festival in Live Oak, FL. Tyrone Vaughan (son of Jimmie Vaughan and nephew of Stevie Ray Vaughan) joined the band to create the new guitar line up. In January 2015, Royal Southern Brotherhood recorded the band's fourth release, Don't Look Back: The Muscle Shoals Sessions, at Fame Studio in Muscle Shoals, Alabama. On December 2, 2015, Cyril Neville was presented along with Dr. John the 'Louie Award' for their dedication to preserving and promoting the cultural legacy of Louis Armstrong at the Museum's annual gala which included a Royal Southern Brotherhood performance. For his part, Neville says, It is an extreme privilege to be honored by the Louis Armstrong House Museum and to honor Satchmo myself at the Gala. I've read that Jazz Music is the only true art form America has contributed to the world, which means Louis Armstrong is the Roux of the musical Gumbo that America is still serving to the world.

Qi was a major power during the Spring and Autumn period of ancient China. His personal name was L√º Chujiu (ÂëÇÊùµËáº), ancestral name Jiang (Âßú), and Duke Jing was his posthumous title. After the years of unrest as two powerful ministers, Cui Zhu and Qing Feng, sought to control the state of Qi, Duke Jing appointed Yan Ying as his prime minister, and Qi entered a period of relative peace and prosperity. Accession to the throne Duke Jing was born to a concubine of Duke Ling of Qi. His mother was a daughter of Shusun Xuanbo, head of one of the Three Huan clans that dominated the control of power in the neighbouring State of Lu. When his father died in 554 BC, his older half-brother Duke Zhuang succeeded Duke Ling and killed Crown Prince Ya with the support of the powerful minister Cui Zhu (Â¥îÊùº). However, Duke Zhuang had an adulterous relationship with Cui's wife, and was killed by Cui in 548 BC. The day after killing Duke Zhuang, Cui Zhu installed Duke Jing on the throne. Cui and Qing Feng (ÊÖ∂Â∞Å), another powerful nobleman, were Duke Jing's co-prime ministers and controlled the state. The Cui‚ÄìQing Unrest In 546 BC, the second year of Duke Jing's reign, the sons of Cui Zhu's two wives fought each other for the right to succeed their father as leader of the clan. The two sons of Cui's deceased first wife killed the son of Cui's second wife, Tang Jiang, from her previous marriage. Cui sought help from Qing Feng, who took the opportunity to kill Cui's sons and exterminate the Cui clan. Cui Zhu and his wife both committed suicide. As a result, Qing Feng gained full control of Qi. Qing Feng's power did not last long. Just a year later, Qing Feng had a dispute with his son Qing She. Taking advantage of the discord within the Qing clan, four other aristocratic clans of Qi: Tian, Bao, Gao, and Luan, jointly attacked the Qing clan. Qing Feng fled to the State of Lu, which soon expelled him for fear of offending Qi, and Qing settled in the State of Wu. After the Cui‚ÄìQing unrest, Duke Jing appointed Yan Ying as his prime minister, and the State of Qi entered a period of relative peace and prosperity. Yan Ying died in 500 BC, the 48th year of Duke Jing's reign, and is remembered as one of the greatest statesmen and diplomats of the Spring and Autumn period. Succession Duke Jing's main wife was Yan Ji, a princess of the State of Yan, whose son was the crown prince of Qi. Duke Jing also had a favoured concubine named Yu Si,The Shiji incorrectly gives her name as Rui Ji and Rui Zi. who was from the minor state of Chunyu. The crown prince, however, died just before Duke Jing in the summer of 490 BC. Although Duke Jing had at least five other adult sons, he decided to make Prince Tu, his youngest son by Yu Si, the new crown prince. Because Prince Tu was a young boy and his mother was of a lowly status, Duke Jing ordered the ministers Guo Xia of the Guo clan and Gao Zhang of the Gao clan to support Prince Tu and exile the other princes to the remote city of Lai. Duke Jing died soon afterward in the autumn of 490 BC. Guo and Gao installed Prince Tu on the throne, and the other princes escaped to the nearby states of Wey and Lu. However, the next year, the Tian and Bao clans led by Tian Qi and Bao Mu revolted and defeated the Gao and Guo clans. Tian Qi brought back Prince Yangsheng from Lu and installed him on the throne, to be known as Duke Dao of Qi. Duke Dao soon killed his younger half-brother Prince Tu, who is posthumously known as An Ruzi. Tomb Sacrificial horses discovered in the tomb of Duke Jing of Qi The tomb of Duke Jing of Qi () has been discovered in the village of Yatou (Â¥ñÂ§¥) in Linzi District of Zibo, Shandong Province, north-east of the site of the ancient Qi capital Linzi. In 1964, archaeologists made a striking discovery of a large site of sacrificial horses buried on the northern side of the tomb. 145 horse skeletons were found. The pit for the sacrificial horses is long, wrapping around the tomb on three sides. In 1982, archaeologists excavated a further of the pit and unearthed 106 more horse skeletons. The tomb has not been completely excavated, but archaeologists estimate that more than 600 horses were buried in total, making it by far the largest horse sacrifice site discovered in China. The horses were between the ages of five and seven when they died. It is believed that they were killed by strikes on the head after being fed alcohol and falling unconscious. Also found in the tomb are 30 sacrificial dogs, two pigs, and six other domesticated animals. The tomb is now protected as a National Historical and Cultural Site and a museum has been built on the site. Since 2008 it has been included in the tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites as part of the ancient Qi capital and mausoleum complex.

It has waxy and opposite juvenile leaves, globular buds which are often prominently beaked, and large, round fruits on stalks that are longer than the fruits. It produces cream-coloured flowers in April and May that provide an important source of nectar for wildlife when little else is flowering. It grows on heavy clay soils that are waterlogged in winter and subject to salt-laden coastal winds. Status and conservation Land clearing since European settlement has made this subspecies endangered in Victoria, and it is listed as threatened under the Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988.

Pazhassi Raja aimed to preserve the independence and unity of his kingdom while the British were determined to annex and dismember it. His own desire for independence and sense of betrayal by English on their earlier promise to respect his country‚Äôs independence combined with constant exhortations of his two patriot noblemen, Kaitheri Ambu and Kannavath Sankaran, led to outbreak of Cotiote War. It is the longest war waged by English East India Company during their wars of conquests in India ‚Äì much longer than Anglo-Mysore Wars, Anglo-Maratha Wars, Anglo-Sikh Wars and Polygar Wars. It was one of the bloodiest and hardest wars waged by English in India ‚Äì English regiments that operated suffered losses as high as eighty percent in 10 years of warfare. Cotiote army waged guerrilla warfare, chiefly centred in mountain forests of Aralam and Wynad, and larger zone of conflict extended from Mysore to the Arabian Sea, from Coorg to Coimbatore. Warfare peaked in early 1797, 1800 to 1801, and 1803 to 1804 and due to constant reverses, Bombay regiments were withdrawn and instead Madras regiments were deployed with an increase in number of troops - from 8,000 in 1803 to 14,000 in early 1804. Cotiote War is the only war in which famed General Arthur Wellesley, Duke of Wellington failed ‚Äì Wellesley himself admitted that Cotiote War cannot be won as long as Raja was alive and his prediction came true.

Cotiote army manpower is not exactly known - estimates vary between 2,000 and 6,000.

Colour dispersion angles exaggerated for visualisation. The history of spectroscopy began in the 17th century. New designs in optics, specifically prisms, enabled systematic observations of the solar spectrum. Isaac Newton first applied the word spectrum to describe the rainbow of colors that combine to form white light. During the early 1800s, Joseph von Fraunhofer conducted experiments with dispersive spectrometers that enabled spectroscopy to become a more precise and quantitative scientific technique. Since then, spectroscopy has played and continues to play a significant role in chemistry, physics and astronomy. Fraunhofer observed and measured dark lines in the Sun's spectrum (they bear now his name although several of them were observed earlier by Wollaston). Origins and experimental development The Romans were already familiar with the ability of a prism to generate a rainbow of colors.See: Newton is traditionally regarded as the founder of spectroscopy, but he was not the first man of science who studied and reported on the solar spectrum. The works of Athanasius Kircher (1646), Jan Marek Marci (1648), Robert Boyle (1664), and Francesco Maria Grimaldi (1665), predate Newton's optics experiments (1666‚Äì1672). Newton published his experiments and theoretical explanations of dispersion of light in his 'Opticks'. His experiments demonstrated that white light could be split up into component colors by means of a prism and that these components could be recombined to generate white light. He demonstrated that the prism is not imparting or creating the colors but rather separating constituent parts of the white light. Newton's corpuscular theory of light was gradually succeeded by the wave theory. It was not until the 19th century that the quantitative measurement of dispersed light was recognized and standardized. As with many subsequent spectroscopy experiments, Newton's sources of white light included flames and stars, including our own sun. Subsequent studies of the nature of light include those of Hooke, Huygens, Young. Subsequent experiments with prisms provided the first indications that spectra were associated uniquely with chemical constituents. Scientists observed the emission of distinct patterns of colour when salts were added to alcohol flames.Brand, p. 58 ; see pp. 33‚Äì36.  Early 19th Century (1800 - 1829)  In 1802, William Hyde Wollaston built a spectrometer, improving on Newton's model, that included a lens to focus the Sun‚Äôs spectrum on a screen. Upon use, Wollaston realized that the colors were not spread uniformly, but instead had missing patches of colors, which appeared as dark bands in the sun's spectrum. At the time, Wollaston believed these lines to be natural boundaries between the colors,(Wollaston, 1802), p. 378. but this hypothesis was later ruled out in 1815 by Fraunhofer's work.OpenStax Astronomy, \\"Spectroscopy in Astronomy\\". OpenStax CNX. Sep 29, 2016 http://cnx.org/contents/1f92a120-370a-4547-b14e-a3df3ce6f083@3 Solar spectrum with Fraunhofer lines as it appears visually. Joseph von Fraunhofer made a significant experimental leap forward by replacing a prism with a diffraction grating as the source of wavelength dispersion. Fraunhofer built off the theories of light interference developed by Thomas Young, Fran√ßois Arago and Augustin-Jean Fresnel. He conducted his own experiments to demonstrate the effect of passing light through a single rectangular slit, two slits, and so forth, eventually developing a means of closely spacing thousands of slits to form a diffraction grating. The interference achieved by a diffraction grating both improves the spectral resolution over a prism and allows for the dispersed wavelengths to be quantified. Fraunhofer's establishment of a quantified wavelength scale paved the way for matching spectra observed in multiple laboratories, from multiple sources (flames and the sun) and with different instruments. Fraunhofer made and published systematic observations of the solar spectrum, and the dark bands he observed and specified the wavelengths of are still known as Fraunhofer lines.Brand, pp. 37-42 Throughout the early 1800s, a number of scientists pushed the techniques and understanding of spectroscopy forward. In the 1820s both John Herschel and William H. F. Talbot made systematic observations of salts using flame spectroscopy.Brand, p. 59  Mid 19th Century (1830 - 1869)  In 1835, Charles Wheatstone reported that different metals could be easily distinguished by the different bright lines in the emission spectra of their sparks, thereby introducing an alternative mechanism to flame spectroscopy. In 1849, J. B. L. Foucault experimentally demonstrated that absorption and emission lines appearing at the same wavelength are both due to the same material, with the difference between the two originating from the temperature of the light source.Brand, pp. 60-62See: In 1853, the Swedish physicist Anders Jonas √Öngstr√∂m presented observations and theories about gas spectra in his work Optiska Unders√∂kningar (Optical investigations) to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.See: * Note: Although √Öngstr√∂m submitted his paper to the Swedish Royal Academy of Science on 16 February 1853, it was published in the volume for Academy's proceedings of 1852. √Öngstr√∂m postulated that an incandescent gas emits luminous rays of the same wavelength as those it can absorb. √Öngstr√∂m was unaware of Foucalt's experimental results. At the same time George Stokes and William Thomson (Kelvin) were discussing similar postulates. √Öngstr√∂m also measured the emission spectrum from hydrogen later labeled the Balmer lines.(√Öngstr√∂m, 1852), p. 352 ; (√Öngstr√∂m, 1855b), p. 337. In 1854 and 1855, David Alter published observations on the spectra of metals and gases, including an independent observation of the Balmer lines of hydrogen.See: Alter's observations of hydrogen's optical spectrum appear on p. 213. Spectroscope of Kirchhoff and Bunsen The systematic attribution of spectra to chemical elements began in the 1860s with the work of German physicist Bunsen and Kirchhoff found that Fraunhofer lines correspond to emission spectral lines observed in laboratory light sources, and so they laid way for spectrochemical analysis in laboratory and astrophysics. Bunsen and Kirchhoff applied the optical techniques of Fraunhofer, Bunsen's improved flame source and a highly systematic experimental procedure to a detailed examination of the spectra of chemical compounds. They established the linkage between chemical elements and their unique spectral patterns. In the process, they established the technique of analytical spectroscopy. In 1860, they published their findings on the spectra of eight elements and identified these elements' presence in several natural compounds.See: See also Plate II following p. 168. They demonstrated that spectroscopy could be used for trace chemical analysis and several of the chemical elements they discovered were previously unknown. Kirchhoff and Bunsen also definitively established the link between absorption and emission lines, including attributing solar absorption lines to particular elements based on their corresponding spectra.Brand, pp. 63-64 Kirchhoff went on to contribute fundamental research on the nature of spectral absorption and emission, including what is now known as Kirchhoff's Law of Thermal Radiation. Kirchhoff's applications of this law to spectroscopy are captured in three laws of spectroscopy: #An incandescent solid, liquid or gas under high pressure emits a continuous spectrum. #A hot gas under low pressure emits a \\"bright-line\\" or emission-line spectrum. #A continuous spectrum source viewed through a cool, low-density gas produces an absorption-line spectrum. In the 1860s the husband-and-wife team of William and Margaret Huggins used spectroscopy to determine that the stars were composed of the same elements as found on earth. They also used the non- relativistic Doppler shift (redshift) equation on the spectrum of the star Sirius in 1868 to determine its axial speed. See pp. 548‚Äì550. They were the first to take a spectrum of a planetary nebula when the Cat's Eye Nebula (NGC 6543) was analyzed. See p. 438, \\"No. 4373\\". Using spectral techniques, they were able to distinguish nebulae from galaxies. August Beer observed a relationship between light absorption and concentration and created the color comparator which was later replaced by a more accurate device called the spectrophotometer.  Late 19th Century (1870 - 1899)  In the 19th century new developments such as the discovery of photography, Rowland's invention of the concave diffraction grating, and Schumann'sSchumann's papers are listed in T. Lyman, The Spectroscopy of the Extreme Ultraviolet (Longmans, Green and Company, London, 1928), 2nd ed. works on discovery of vacuum ultraviolet (fluorite for prisms and lenses, low-gelatin photographic plates and absorption of UV in air below 185 nm) made advance to shorter wavelengths very fast. At the same time Dewar observed series in alkali spectra, Hartley found constant wave-number differences, Balmer discovered a relation connecting wavelengths in the visible hydrogen spectrum, and finally Rydberg derived a formula for wave-numbers of spectral series. Johann Balmer discovered in 1885 that the four visible lines of hydrogen were part of a series that could be expressed in terms of integers. This was followed a few years later by the Rydberg formula, which described additional series of lines.See: English summary: Meanwhile, the substantial summary of past experiments performed by Maxwell (1873), resulted in his equations of electromagnetic waves. In 1895, the German physicist Wilhelm Conrad R√∂ntgen discovered and extensively studied X-rays, which were later used in X-ray spectroscopy. One year later, in 1896, French physicist Antoine Henri Becquerel discovered radioactivity, and Dutch physicist Pieter Zeeman observed spectral lines being split by a magnetic field.See:  Early 20th century (1900-1950)  The first decade of the 20th century brought the basics of quantum theory (Plank, Einstein) and interpretation of spectral series of hydrogen by Lyman in VUV and by Paschen in infrared. Ritz formulated the combination principle. In 1913 Bohr formulated his quantum mechanical model of atom. This stimulated empirical term analysis (see references in, page 83). Bohr published a theory of the hydrogen-like atoms that could explain the observed wavelengths of spectral lines due to electrons transitioning from different energy states. In 1937 \\"E. Lehrer created the first fully-automated spectrometer\\" to help more accurately measure spectral lines. With the development of more advanced instruments such as photo-detectors scientists were then able to more accurately measure specific wavelength absorption of substances. Development of quantum mechanics Between 1920 and 1930 fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics were developed by Pauli, Heisenberg, Schr√∂dinger, and Dirac. Understanding of the spin and exclusion principle allowed conceiving how electron shells of atoms are filled with the increasing atomic number. Multiply ionized atoms This branch of spectroscopy deals with radiation related to atoms that are stripped of several electrons (multiply ionized atoms (MIA), multiply charged ions, highly charged ions). These are observed in very hot plasmas (laboratory or astrophysical) or in accelerator experiments (beam-foil, electron beam ion trap (EBIT)). The lowest exited electron shells of such ions decay into stable ground states producing photons in VUV, EUV and soft X-ray spectral regions (so-called resonance transitions). Structure studies Further progress in studies of atomic structure was in tight connection with the advance to shorter wavelength in EUV region. Millikan, Sawyer, Bowen used electric discharges in vacuum to observe some emission spectral lines down to 13 nm they prescribed to stripped atoms. In 1927 Osgood and Hoag reported on grazing incidence concave grating spectrographs and photographed lines down to 4.4 nm (KŒ± of carbon). Dauvillier used a fatty acid crystal of large crystal grating space to extend soft x-ray spectra up to 12.1 nm, and the gap was closed. In the same period Manne Siegbahn constructed a very sophisticated grazing incidence spectrograph that enabled Ericson and Edl√©n to obtain spectra of vacuum spark with high quality and to reliably identify lines of multiply ionized atoms up to O VI, with five stripped electrons. Grotrian developed his graphic presentation of energy structure of the atoms. Russel and Saunders proposed their coupling scheme for the spin-orbit interaction and their generally recognized notation for spectral terms. Accuracy Theoretical quantum-mechanical calculations become rather accurate to describe the energy structure of some simple electronic configurations. The results of theoretical developments were summarized by Condon and Shortley in 1935. Edl√©n thoroughly analyzed spectra of MIA for many chemical elements and derived regularities in energy structures of MIA for many isoelectronic sequences (ions with the same number of electrons, but different nuclear charges). Spectra of rather high ionization stages (e.g. Cu XIX) were observed. The most exciting event was in 1942, when Edl√©n proved the identification of some solar coronal lines on the basis of his precise analyses of spectra of MIA. This implied that the solar corona has a temperature of a million degrees, and strongly advanced understanding of solar and stellar physics. After the WW II experiments on balloons and rockets were started to observe the VUV radiation of the Sun. (See X-ray astronomy). More intense research continued since 1960 including spectrometers on satellites. In the same period the laboratory spectroscopy of MIA becomes relevant as a diagnostic tool for hot plasmas of thermonuclear devices (see Nuclear fusion) which begun with building Stellarator in 1951 by Spitzer, and continued with tokamaks, z-pinches and the laser produced plasmas. Progress in ion accelerators stimulated beam-foil spectroscopy as a means to measure lifetimes of exited states of MIA. Many various data on highly exited energy levels, autoionization and inner-core ionization states were obtained. Electron beam ion trap Simultaneously theoretical and computational approaches provided data necessary for identification of new spectra and interpretation of observed line intensities. New laboratory and theoretical data become very useful for spectral observation in space. It was a real upheaval of works on MIA in USA, England, France, Italy, Israel, Sweden, Russia and other countries A new page in the spectroscopy of MIA may be dated as 1986 with development of EBIT (Levine and Marrs, LLNL) due to a favorable composition of modern high technologies such as cryogenics, ultra- high vacuum, superconducting magnets, powerful electron beams and semiconductor detectors. Very quickly EBIT sources were created in many countries (see NIST summary for many details as well as reviews). A wide field of spectroscopic research with EBIT is enabled including achievement of highest grades of ionization (U92+), wavelength measurement, hyperfine structure of energy levels, quantum electrodynamic studies, ionization cross- sections (CS) measurements, electron-impact excitation CS, X-ray polarization, relative line intensities, dielectronic recombination CS, magnetic octupole decay, lifetimes of forbidden transitions, charge-exchange recombination, etc. Infrared and Raman spectroscopy Many early scientists who studied the IR spectra of compounds had to develop and build their own instruments to be able to record their measurements making it very difficult to get accurate measurements. During World War II, the U.S. government contracted different companies to develop a method for the polymerization of butadiene to create rubber, but this could only be done through analysis of Ca hydrocarbon isomers. These contracted companies started developing optical instruments and eventually created the first infrared spectrometers. With the development of these commercial spectrometers Infrared Spectroscopy became a more popular method to determine the \\"fingerprint\\" for any molecule. Raman spectroscopy was first observed in 1928 by Sir Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman in liquid substances and also by \\"Grigory Landsberg and Leonid Mandelstam in crystals\\". Raman spectroscopy is based on the observation of the raman effect which is defined as \\"The intensity of the scattered light is dependent on the amount of the polarization potential change\\". The raman spectrum records light intensity vs. light frequency (wavenumber) and the wavenumber shift is characteristic to each individual compound. Laser spectroscopy Laser spectroscopy is a spectroscopic technique that uses lasers to be able determine the emitted frequencies of matter. The laser was invented because spectroscopists took the concept of its predecessor, the maser, and applied it to the visible and infrared ranges of light. The maser was invented by Charles Townes and other spectroscopists to stimulate matter to determine the radiative frequencies that specific atoms and molecules emitted. While working on the maser, Townes realized that more accurate detections were possible as the frequency of the microwave emitted increased. This led to an idea a few years later to use the visible and eventually the infrared ranges of light for spectroscopy that became a reality with the help of Arthur Schawlow. Since then, lasers have gone on to significantly advance experimental spectroscopy. The laser light allowed for much higher precision experiments specifically in the uses of studying collisional effects of light as well as being able to accurately detect specific wavelengths and frequencies of light, allowing for the invention of devices such as laser atomic clocks. Lasers also made spectroscopy that used time methods more accurate by using speeds or decay times of photons at specific wavelengths and frequencies to keep time. Laser spectroscopic techniques have been used for many different applications. One example is using laser spectroscopy to detect compounds in materials. One specific method is called Laser-induced Fluorescence Spectroscopy, and uses spectroscopic methods to be able to detect what materials are in a solid, liquid, or gas, in situ. This allows for direct testing of materials, instead of having to take the material to a lab to figure out what the solid, liquid, or gas is made of.

The General Fund makes up 3/4th of the entire budget; it allocates monies to state operations and payments to localities. The annual budget is proposed by the California State Legislature and approved by the Governor of California, who enjoys the prerogative of line-item veto.  California's tax system  California levies a 9.3 percent maximum variable rate income tax, with six tax brackets, collecting about $40 billion per year (representing approximately 51% of General Fund revenue and 40% of tax revenue overall in FY2007). California has a state sales tax of 8.25%, which can total up to 10.75% with local sales tax included. All real property is taxable annually, the tax based on the property's fair market value at the time of purchase or completion of new construction. Property tax increases are capped at 2% per year (see Proposition 13). One notable side effect of California's tax structure is that a substantial portion of the state's income comes from a small proportion of wealthy citizens. For example, it is estimated that in 2004 the richest 3% of state taxpayers (those with tax returns showing over $200,000 in yearly income) paid approximately 60% of state income taxes.  Surplus  California is predicted to have a budget surplus of several billion dollars for 2019. This is helped by the state's record low unemployment rate of 4.0% for 2019.  California public spending =2008-2010 State spending increased from $56 billion in 1998 to $131 billion in 2008, and the state was facing a budget deficit of $40 billion in 2008. California faced a $26.3 billion budget deficit for the 2009‚Äì2010 budget year. While the legislative bodies appeared to address the problem in 2008 with the three- month delayed passage of a budget they in fact only postponed the deficit to 2009 and due to the late 2008 decline in the economy and the credit crisis the problem became urgent in November 2008. California faced another budget gap for 2010, with $72 billion in debt. California faced a massive and still- growing debt.\\"State of California Debt Clock\\" In June 2009 Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said \\"Our wallet is empty, our bank is closed and our credit is dried up.\\" He called for massive budget cuts of $24 billion, about of the state's budget. State debt and budget deficit 2012 brought somewhat of an improvement to state finances, though the state still faced a $16 billion budget deficit for the year. To help alleviate this, Governor Jerry Brown introduced proposals to bring measures to voters, in order to pass tax increases. If these are not passed, more severe cuts are expected. California's unemployment rate also fell from a high above 12.4% to below 11% in 2012. In 2017 a miscalculation of the costs for the state's Medi-Cal program of $1.9 billion in 2016 led Governor Jerry Brown to project the state of California will face a $1.6 billion budget deficit. As of January 2017, California and Kansas were the only two western states with an AA- bond credit rating, however other states have similar or even lower ratings. Public borrowing California uses two kinds of tax anticipation notes: Revenue Anticipation Notes (RANS), which are issued and paid back within a fiscal year, and Revenue Anticipation Warrants (RAWS), which are issued on a fiscal year and paid back the following fiscal year. RANS are commonly used due to the delay between expenditure and tax collection while RAWS are only used in times of crisis.

He is most well known for his debut album Sirens. Greenwood is also known for his previous work with psychedelic rock band The See See and country rock band The Loose Salute. He has toured in Mojave 3 and Starsailor. Greenwood was born in Morley, Leeds, England and grew up in Headingley. Career=Biography Pete Greenwood started his career playing guitar in pubs in South London, honing his craft surrounded by fellow troubadours of the early 2000s Folk scene. Pete attended Goldsmiths, University of London for a degree in music where encouraged by his professor Pete Astor, he wrote his first two songs there ‚Äì \\"Any Given Day\\" and \\"Bats Over Barstow\\". With a reputation as one of the city's hottest Guitarists, Mojave 3 invited him on tour and he came back to a record deal with Heavenly Recordings. The album '‚ÄôSirens\\" resulted, earning him four stars and Debut of the Month August 2008 in Uncut Magazine. \\"Sirens\\" also made UNCUT's Top 50 list for 2008 year. Greenwood later joined The See See ‚Äì a London-based psychedelic pop supergroup ‚Äì who were handpicked to support The Raconteurs and The Brian Jonestown massacre. Dividing his time between solo and band projects, Pete toured USA, Canada, Japan, Europe, UK. Pete later also joined Starsailor on their European tour as a featured musician. In amongst the touring and recording for compilations (MOJO \\"White Album Recovered\\", Rough Trade \\"Psych Folk\\") Pete recorded his follow up album Beauceron. However, delays ensued resulting in a return to his native Leeds and a change of record label. \\"The 88\\" (taken from the album Beauceron) is often referenced as a firm fan live favourite, originally released as a limited edition split 7\\" single with Doves on Rough Trade Records in 2009 (re- released as a standalone 7\\" in 2013). Noel Gallagher cited Pete Greenwood's track \\"The 88\\" in his Perfect Playlists for Q Magazine in 2013, voting the track his \\"Song of the Year\\" stating he wished he'd written it. Greenwood returned to the live music scene in 2015 with the first official single, \\"Me And Molly\\", released on 18 September 2015, taken from the album, Beauceron, which was released on 16 October 2015.

History of the museum  Ancient House, where museum is situated, is a monument of history and architecture of the late 18th ‚Äì early 19th century. Built in the style of the ancient Russian classicism, it served as chancery and premises of the main commanders of the Black Sea Fleet during 1794‚Äì1900. In due time such admirals as M. S. Mordvinov, I. De Traverse, A. S. Greig, M. P. Lazarev, G. I. Butakov, M. A. Arcas lived and worked here.  Exhibitions  The museum exhibition is located in twelve rooms and numbers nearly 3,000 exhibits. Exhibits in the first hall depict items of antiquity and from the time of the Kievan Rus, and describe the beginning of navigation through the Dnipro and Southern Bug rivers, the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. There are pictures of ancient Greek ships, illustrations of a deserved painter V. Bahtov to the \\"Histories\\" of Herodotus, archeological finds of antique Olbia, fragments of stony anchors. Exhibits which are devoted to the fleet history of Zaporizhian Cossacks and their heroic combat for access to the Black Sea are of great interest. The pearl of the museum is the diorama \\"Building the ships on the Mykolaiv Admiralty in the first quarter of the 19th century\\" by V. Semernev. In the hall of the Crimean War (1853‚Äì1856) the authentic relics of the past are located: the naval flag of St. Andrew, ship cannons, awards and documents of seamen and veterans of war. The bust of sailor Ignat Shevchenko (sculptor G. Kovalchuk), who performed a heroic deed during the defense of Sevastopol, also attracts the attention of visitors. The Crimean War was a milestone in the transition from sailing ships to steam ships. Museum exhibits include the model of the first tubular vessel in the Black Sea, the \\"Novgorod\\", launched by the Nikolaev Admiralty in 1873 as well as a portrait of the author's draft of the ship, the famous engineer and shipbuilder A. O. Popov. And on the court, under the expanse of the sky, are the guns from the Black Sea Fleet, covered with glory of combat feats. The best tradition continued in the post-war works of the masters of the ship's business and sailors of the Black Sea. The hall exhibits items of ship's equipment, fragments of shells of ships, maritime communications devices and collection of ship tableware. The exhibit section \\"modern civilian fleet ‚Äì the end of the 1940‚Äì1990s.\\" tells about the activities of Europe's largest Black Sea Shipyard, one of the oldest companies in the south of Ukraine -Shipyard named after 61 Communards, and the youngest in the Nikolayev shipyard \\"Okean\\".

Much criticism surrounded the British and American media's coverage of the incident after the Daily Mail and other sites claimed, without evidence, that many Chinese news sources considered the two victims to have been irresponsibly showing off their wealth. It also sparked safety concerns around the campus in South Los Angeles, an area notorious for its history of crime-ridden neighborhoods. The two suspects, Javier Bolden and Bryan Barnes, aged 19 and 20 at the time of the shooting, were arrested in connection with the murders. In 2014, Barnes was found guilty of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. In October of the same year, Bolden was also found guilty, and in November was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. Details On April 11, 2012, at 1:00 a.m., students Ming Qu and Ying Wu were shot to death after sitting in their parked 2003 BMW on the 2700 block of Raymond Avenue, located one mile northwest from the University of Southern California campus. After noticing two men with guns approaching them in the car, Qu managed to get out of the car and run to a nearby home where he pounded on the door but was shot several times in the head. Wu was killed by a single shot to the chest while she was sitting in the front passenger's seat. At the time of the shooting, it was raining heavily, creating challenging conditions at the crime scene. Qu and Wu were both taken to California Hospital Medical Center in downtown Los Angeles, where they were both pronounced dead on arrival. The two 23-year-old students were both from China and were studying electrical engineering. Investigators believe that the motive behind the shooting may have been sparked during a carjacking or robbery. Arrests Police traced a cell phone taken by the perpetrators from the scene of the shooting. On May 18, 2012, that led to the arrest of Bryan Barnes, 20 years old, who was living near USC's campus in the South Los Angeles area. A second suspect, 19-year-old Javier Bolden, a resident of Palmdale, was detained that day. They were both charged with two counts of murder. Bolden and Barnes were also charged with attempted murder in an unrelated shooting in December 2011 at a party in South Los Angeles, which left a woman seriously wounded and a man paralyzed. Officials also suspect Barnes of firing multiple rounds at a party on February 12, wounding a 20-year-old man. The two are eligible for the death penalty according to prosecutors. Aftermath=Legal proceedings Bryan Barnes pled guilty to two counts of murder on February 25, 2014, and was immediately sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole. Barnes also admitted two so- called special circumstances that could have made him eligible for the death penalty. Co-defendant Javier Bolden was convicted in October 2014 and sentenced to life without parole. Response About one thousand people gathered at a memorial in mourning for the two victims at the Shrine Auditorium the following week of the shooting. Los Angeles Chinese Consul General Qiu Shaofang made the following statement: \\"The ministry of foreign affairs, ministry of education and the Consulate General of the People‚Äôs Republic of China in Los Angeles acted immediately after the tragedy happened and have committed [to] join efforts in tackling problems arising from the incident.\\" Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa made a response to the attack sending his condolences. Criticism The US and UK media was heavily criticized for giving scant coverage of the murders themselves in favor of focusing attention on a subset of private Chinese netizens posting online comments who were generally unsympathetic about the incident and criticized the victims for unnecessarily showing off what they believed were luxurious items of theirs. Such comments were not associated with any official news channels in China. Immediately after the shooting was reported, an anonymous article at the Daily Mail claimed further that Chinese news sites were not sympathetic to the murders, but did not provide any examples to back up such assertions. In any case, friends of the two victims stated that \\"'Ying and Ming lived a simple life during their nearly two-year study at USC. In order to keep their living expenses down, they both shared rooms with other classmates.\\" The area surrounding University of Southern California's campus is an urban, low income community that has a historically high crime rate. The parents of the two students filed a lawsuit against the school for misrepresenting security on campus. The lawsuit was dismissed by Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Michael Johnson in February 2013. Johnson found no connection between the killings and the University's self-reported efforts to protect students, stating that \\"Causation is an insurmountable issue for the plaintiffs.\\" CBS Los Angeles \\"Wrongful Death Lawsuit Against USC Dismissed,\\" February 15, 2013 http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2013/02/15/wrongful-death- lawsuit-against-usc-dismissed/abc 7 Eyewitness News, Los Angeles \\"Judge Sides with USC in Wrongful Death Lawsuit Over Fatally Shot Students,\\" November 13, 2012 http://abc7.com/archive/8884335/ References Murder in Los Angeles Deaths by firearm in California 2012 murders in the United States 2012 in California People murdered in Los Angeles Crimes in Los Angeles Murdered students Chinese people murdered abroad Anti-Chinese sentiment in the United States ","title":"Murders of Ming Qu and Ying Wu"},{"id":"35980860","text":"Rumoshtik (, also Romanized as R≈´moshtƒ´k and R≈´mashtƒ´k; also known as R≈´moshnƒ´tak and Rumashti) is a village in Paskuh Rural District, Sedeh District, Qaen County, South Khorasan Province, Iran.

Context  Aegidius, who had proclaimed the secession of the northern part of Gaul in 461 after the assassination of Emperor Majorian by Ricimer, a magister militum of Germanic origin who wanted greater control over the Western Empire. Ricimer installed what he hoped would be a more easily controllable emperor, Flavius Libius Severus Serpentius, a move that backfired as he was not recognized by a few of the provinces or by the eastern half of the empire. The battle Aegidius, having been stripped of his title by Ricimer, threatened to attack the Italian Peninsula with his considerable army. The Visigoths, sensing an opportunity to extend the frontier of their northern kingdom past the Loire River which was the contemporary boundary of their empire, and having been encouraged by Ricimer to attack the Alans, then allied to the Romans, to deflect their attention away from Italy, mobilized their army for an attack. The two armies met at Orl√©ans in 463. The conflict ended in a costly defeat and rout of the Visigothic army and the death of their commander, Federico, the brother of Theodoric II.  Aftermath  This defeat halted for some time the ambitions of the Visigoths with respect to this northern region of Gaul. This was fortunate for Aegidius and the Roman rump state as they were also being constantly harassed by the Saxons under Odoacer. This Visigoth timidity ended with the Roman provocation at Battle of D√©ols where a Romano-British invasion army under Riothamus was defeated by the Visigoths from 470-71.  In Historical Literature  The existence of this battle is referred to in various texts throughout the ages: * Hydatius: Adversus Aegidium comitem utriusque militiae, virum, ut fama commendat, Deo bonis operibus complacentem, in Armoricana provincia Fretiricus frater Theuderici regis insurgens, cum his cum quibus fuerat, superatus occiditur. (Chronicle, 218). Of note, Hydatius places this battle in the year 461, missing from his account any data for the years ranging from 462 to 464. * The Chronica Gallica of 511: In the fifth year of the reign of Leo I the Thracian [which took place around 461-462] Fredericus frater Theuderici regis pugnans cum Francis occiditur iuxta Ligerim. * Marius Aventicensis: [During the councilship of Basil and Vibiano of 463] His consulibus pugna facta est inter Aegidium et Gothos inter Ligerum et Ligericinum iuxta Aurelianis ibique interfectus est Fredericus rex Gothorum. * Also, Gregory of Tours (II, 18) refers to the fighting in which the king of the Salian Franks, Childeric I had participated in during those years. Most modern historians have come to the conclusion that Aegidius had Frankish troops in his service and that Childeric was either a Roman ally or client during this time. That being stated, there is no concrete proof to affirm that there Childeric had been present, nor of the alliance between the two groups.

In the novel, Kyle Craig has come back for one final scare to finally kill Alex Cross, but Alex has a special day ahead of him, one that concerns Bree and his relationship. The novel was released in hardcover, paperback, and audio book on November 15, 2010. It was preceded by I, Alex Cross and was followed by Kill Alex Cross. The book sees Alex marrying Bree after proposing to her in the previous book; the book also sees the final appearance of Kyle Craig, who dies by shooting an oxygen tank, killing him and two cops before he can be sent to prison again by Alex. Plot Psychotic former FBI agent and serial killer Kyle Craig, who escaped from ADX Florence Supermax Prison in Double Cross, awaits FBI agent Max Siegel. After questioning him, he reveals he plans to get plastic surgery and thus become Max Siegel by gaining his physical features; he then kills Siegel. Meanwhile, back in Washington, D.C., psychologist and Metro police detective Alex Cross has proposed to his girlfriend, Brianna 'Bree' Stone, and the two are currently planning their wedding. However, Alex is called in to a sniper case. At the crime scene, two infamous people (known to be political) are murdered. Alex instantly recognizes it as a sniper when all others are oblivious to this at first ‚Äì that is, until agent Max Siegel/Kyle Craig comes and meets Cross, who is instantly annoyed by ‚Äì and dislikes ‚Äì Siegel. Craig wants Alex dead for sending him to prison years earlier. Meanwhile, Alex's best and closest friend, John Sampson, asks for Alex's assistance in a series of murders with numbers on the victims' faces. Mitch and Denny, the murderers in the sniper case, strike again. Unknown to Mitch, they work for a rich man, who will pay Denny and Mitch. The two alternate between living in a suburban and a homeless shelter. After two other sniper murders, Alex figures out the killers use a white suburban and starts a search on it. Kyle Craig/Max Siegel has sex with a hooker and kills her; he later murders a woman from the FBI that Alex knew from the DCAK case (in Double Cross) and deposits her body with random murders, falsely implying he is the number-serial-killer. Denny and Mitch later steal a computer from two teenagers, and write a message via email to the Washington newspaper. The newspaper company soon learns of and reads it, but the cops come to investigate. Cross questions the chief in staff, reads the e-mail, and later learns of the murderers' names from the woman/head in staff. Meanwhile, Mitch and Denny visit Mitch's ex-wife, who does not let see their child/daughter see their father. Mitch gives her a thousand dollars to make up for child care. They then go visit Mitch's mother; her husband (Mitch's father) died two years ago, at which time Mitch left. The two eat dinner at Mitch's mother's house and flee. However, before leaving, Denny kills Mitch's mother, unbeknownst to Mitch. Meanwhile, coming back to see the chief in staff at her office at the newspaper building, she reveals that Denny and Mitch live at a few shelters. Max Siegel, Sampson, and Alex go and look for the two at numerous shelters, and find a suspicious man who flees after they question him. Alex finds a knife in the man's jacket and tells Sampson to chase after him. Sampson follows him, but loses him. Meanwhile, at a computer base system Alex finds out the man's name is Sajiwa, that he has a criminal record, that he used to teach math and other things like the numbers on the victim's faces. When looking for him later, Alex and Sampson learn that Sajiwa has been killed by Kyle. Denny and Mitch dump the Suburban in water, because earlier they had been seemingly 'suspicious' to police officers at a border and escape in another vehicle. Later, they commit their final sniper murder, from afar at a museum, on a political famous person who messed up. The mess-up caused his company to shut down and caused thousands of people to be out of work. When leaving, Denny kills Mitch, citing it as \\"just business\\". The next day, Alex is at the scene and tries to figure out where the sniper shot. He goes to the museum, and finds Mitch's body. Denny corners Alex, and forces Alex to throw away his Glock. Before Denny can kill Alex, Siegel shoots and kills Denny, who earlier killed his former (sniper-hit-list) employer. Alex and Siegel finally become actual friends, with Alex thanking Siegel. Bree and Alex finally get married, spend the night alone together, and make love. However, the next day Siegel comes for a visit, unbeknownst to Alex, who receives a phone call from Kyle Craig. Craig ‚Äì without saying it ‚Äì implies that he is Max Siegel. Alex and Bree soon figure it out, and upon trying to stop Craig, Alex chases Kyle and they start fighting. Alex overpowers him, and shoots him in both legs. Paramedics and two cops come. While Craig is being taken away, he grabs a cop's gun and shoots his oxygen tank in the paramedics' vehicle, killing the paramedics, himself, and the two cops. Alex is sort of glad that Kyle is dead, deciding he may write a novel based on his and Craig's adventures in friendship into enemies, and Craig's final stand (which ultimately led to his death). Alex and Bree then go on and continue their honeymoon, finally at peace. Notes: * For their first part of their honeymoon, Bree and Alex go to stay at a hotel seen in the James Bond film Casino Royale; this is probably because Alex likes the British character James Bond. * Kyle Craig is believed to be completely psychotic, and near the end of the novel, when they are taking him to a gurney in a paramedics' vehicle, he possibly decides to kill himself. Plot summary This book has two intertwined plots. The primary one involves a series of sniper murders of high-profile persons. Detective Alex Cross and Bree Stone are planning their wedding, but must put their wedding plans on hold to investigate the few clues of the first set of murders and then try to find the perpetrators as more murders are committed. The second plot involves Kyle Craig, a former FBI agent turned into a psychopathic killer (The Mastermind: see previous novels Roses are Red and Violets are Blue). The readers at the novel's start are shown how Craig kills a person, so he can, through plastic surgery, assume his identity and move undetected to Cross. Since Cross helped put Craig into Federal Prison, Craig wants to kill Cross. Craig had escaped from Florence Supermax prison in a previous Cross novel, Double Cross. Meanwhile, the FBI is involved with the sniper case and agent Max Siegel has been assigned to the case. Cross and Siegel do not mix well. Siegel makes amends with Cross, even saving Cross's life. However, Siegel has some very shocking surprises for Alex Cross and Bree Stone.Amazon.com website, https://www.amazon.com/Cross-Fire-Alex-James- Patterson/dp/031603617X; Goodreads website, http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7856305-cross-fire .

The single did not chart in Britain. Recorded during sessions for Robin's Reign it was only included on the German LP and CD version as the last track. Produced by Gibb with his new manager Vic Lewis. Kenny Clayton conducts the orchestra for this song. It reached #5 in Germany and #8 in Austria. The song only features a guitar and orchestra. Gibb sings an Italian language of \\"One Million Years\\", the name was changed to \\"Un Million de Ani\\", but that version was not released. The song's mixed version was released on I've Gotta Get a Message to You (1974). A promotional video was shown on French television in 1969. Background It was recorded around September 1969 with \\"The Worst Girl in This Town\\", \\"Most of My Life\\", \\"Down Came The Sun\\" and \\"Hudson's Fallen Wind\\" (later renamed as \\"Farmer Ferdinand Hudson\\"). The song's structure has a slow acoustic guitar rhythm playing to a mellow drum pattern. The lyric is intriguing but lacks both the orchestral grandeur and brevity of \\"Saved by the Bell\\". Gibb was still making separate mono mixes, so the mono mix, or electronically channeled versions of it, appeared on a few collections until 1974 when a true stereo mix was made for Gotta Get a Message to You. That mix has a different or partially different lead vocal, most easily distinguished in the second verse with I shall stand in mono but I will stand in stereo. Gibb also recorded an alternate vocal track for the song in Italian. Gibb's vocals on \\"One Million Years\\" is high especially on the chorus: I will wait for you yeah, Your eyes will shine like dew Yeah, I close my eyes and you're now here And I'll wait for you. The line i close my eyes was the same title on the Bee Gees' 1967 song which was included on Bee Gees' 1st. Yeah appeared in the chorus two times.

The town was settled, while a district of Massachusetts, in 1636 and incorporated in 1849, 29 years after its admittance to the Union. Its population was 8,349 in the 2010 census. As of 2018's estimation of 8,518, this is about 0.6% of Maine's total population. Five islands (most notably Cousins Island and Littlejohn Island) are part of the town. Yarmouth is part of the Portland-South Portland-Biddeford Metropolitan Statistical Area. The town's proximity to the Atlantic Ocean, and its location on the banks of the Royal River, which empties into Casco Bay less than a mile away, means it is a prime location as a harbor. Ships were built in the harbor mainly between 1818 and the 1870s, at which point demand declined dramatically. Meanwhile, the Royal River's four waterfalls within Yarmouth, whose Main Street sits about 90 feet above sea level, resulted in the foundation of almost sixty mills between 1674 and 1931. The annual Yarmouth Clam Festival attracts around 120,000 people (around fourteen times its population) over the course of the three-day weekend. Today, Yarmouth is a popular dining destination, with (as of June 2020) thirteen sit-down restaurants. This equates to an average of just under one restaurant per square mile of land area. The town is accessed via two exits (15 and 17) on each side of Interstate 295. U.S. Route 1 also passes through the town to the west of I-295. While State Route 115 (the eastern terminus of which occurs at Yarmouth's Marina Road and Lafayette Street intersection) is the town's Main Street, it extends as West Main Street into North Yarmouth and as East Main Street from Lower Falls to Granite Street, two miles away, as part of Route 88. Yarmouth has been designated a Tree City USA community every year since . Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which (58%) is land and (42%) is water. Yarmouth is nearly square in form and is bisected by the Royal River (formerly Yarmouth River). The town is bounded by Freeport to the north (with the Cousins River separating them), North Yarmouth to the northeast, Cumberland to the west and Casco Bay to the south. Also included as part of the town are Cousins Island, Lanes Island, Great and Little Moshier Islands, and Littlejohn Island. Waterfalls The Royal River appealed to settlers because its four waterfalls and 45-foot rise within a mile of navigable water each provided potential waterpower sites. In October 1674, the first sawmill, of Englishman Henry Sayward and Colonel Bartholomew Gedney, was built on the eastern (Main Street) side of the First Falls, by present-day Lafayette Street.The First Falls - Yarmouth's town website (It was abandoned two years later, however, due to conflicts with the Native Americans.) Sayward, who had arrived from England in 1637, had previously built a saw mill in York, Maine, but it burned in 1669, and he lost about $3,500. The Sayward Family, Charles Augustus Sayward - Google Books The Second Falls are just above the Sparhawk Mill, on Bridge Street;Second Falls - Yarmouth's town website the Third Falls are within the bounds of Royal River Park;Third Falls - Yarmouth's town website and the Fourth Falls, near the intersection of East Elm Street and Melissa Drive.Fourth Falls - Yarmouth's town website Since 1674, 57 mills (grain, lumber, pulp and cotton) and several factories (paper production, shoe- and brick-making and, in 1908, Yarmouth Electric Company)Architectural Survey Yarmouth, ME (Phase One, September, 2018 - Yarmouth's town website) have stood on the banks of the river. =The First Falls= Lower Falls and the building which is now 1 Main Street, viewed from what is now Grist Mill Park The same view in 2017 The Native Americans called the First Falls (or Lower Falls) Pumgustuk, which means head of tide. (The town's early firefighters were called Pumgustuk Fire Company. Their eponymous pumper was purchased in 1856 and retired in 1928.)\\"Pumgustuk Fire Company, Yarmouth, ca. 1900\\" - Maine Memory Network In addition to the 1674 sawmill (which became Walter Gendall's Casco Mill in 1681),Ancient North Yarmouth and Yarmouth, Maine 1636-1936: A History, William Hutchison Rowe (1937) this was the site of the first grist mill ‚Äî Lower Grist Mills ‚Äî built in 1813 and whose foundations support the overlook of today's Grist Mill Park. The mill, which was in business for 36 years, ground wheat and corn into flour using power generated by the water turbines set in the fast-flowing river below. Between 1870 and 1885, it was the site of Ansel Loring's second mill, named Yarmouth Flour Mill. His first mill, up at the Fourth Falls, burned down in 1870. In 1720, a young Massachusetts native, Gilbert Winslow, erected a saw mill on Atwell's Creek (which became known colloquially as Folly Creek, due to this venture, which was expected to fail). The creek was \\"a considerable watercourse then\\"; now, though, it is nothing more than a tidal inlet. Winslow married another Massachusetts native, namely Patience Seabury, a daughter of Samuel Seabury, Jr. The first mill to go up on the western (Lafayette Street) side of the river was Samuel Seabury and Jacob Mitchell's grist mill in 1729. The first bridge carrying East Main Street was erected, above the falls, in 1748. It was rebuilt in 1800 \\"below the dam.\\" By 1874, it was flanked by a grist mill, saw mill, a store and a carpenter's shop that took care of the needs of ships built in the harbor on the other side of the bridge. In 1911, Yarmouth Manufacturing Company's electric power plant was built on the site of James Craig's 18th-century sawmill. Later businesses on this side included a fishing, hunting and camping equipment store and Industrial Wood Products. In the present-day building, at 1 Main Street, are F.M. Beck, C.A. White & Associates and Maine Environmental Laboratory. The building was moved here in 1898 from Pleasant Street. =The Second Falls= Sparhawk Mill, formerly a cotton mill, looking north-east. It is now home to several small businesses. The original structure was built in the 1840s but was rebuilt after a fire. The house opposite the mill stands on the site of the mill run by the Hawes and Cox trio. On the hill stands the former home of George G. Loring A variety of mills have used power from the Second Falls. A cotton rag paper mill, run by Massachusetts natives William Hawes and father-and-son due Henry and George Cox, operated on the falls (western) side of the bridge and the eastern side of the river from 1816 until 1821, at which point it was purchased by William Reed Stockbridge and Calvin Stockbridge, brothers who successfully operated it for twenty years as W. R. & C. Stockbridge paper company.Yarmouth Revisited, Amy Aldredge In 1836 it was incorporated as Yarmouth Paper Manufacturing Company, but when advancements in machinery and processes arrived, competition became too difficult and the mill closed. On its site, Philip Kimball later operated a mahogany mill. The first mill of note to stand where the current Sparhawk Mill looms large was North Yarmouth Manufacturing Company. It was founded in 1847 by Eleazer Burbank. The mill produced cotton yarn and cloth. Built in 1840, the brick-made mill replaced a wooden mill dating to 1817. In 1855, the top half of the mill was rebuilt after a fire, but also to accommodate the Royal River Manufacturing Company, which was incorporated in 1857. It was one of the leading industries in Yarmouth, spinning coarse and fine yarn and seamless grain bags, of which it produced up to 1,000 per day. The mill was under the management of brothers Francis Orville Libby and Hosea J. Libby until Barnabas Freeman took over in 1869. Two years later, Freeman joined forces with Lorenzo L. Shaw to start up a cotton mill. After Freeman retired in 1888, Shaw ran the mill on his own until his death in 1907, during which time the mill's tower was completed. An iron bridge was in place around 1900, replacing an earlier 1846 structure. Boarding houses, which still exist today at 107 and 109 Bridge Street, were built on the crest of the northern Bridge Street hill, providing accommodation for weavers, seamstresses and bobbin boys. In 1953, Yale Cordage,Yale Cordage - About Us owned by Oliver Sherman Yale, occupied it. They remained tenants for the next 39 years, until 1992, when the decision was made to divide the mill's interior up into multiple business for extra revenue. The mill got its current name in the early 1950s, when Old Sparhawk Mills Company moved into the building from South Portland. The building is now owned by Sparhawk Group. While their headquarters are in the mill, they have regional offices in Faneuil Hall, Boston, and in New York City. The mill's electric turbines still function, having been revitalized in 1986. =The Third Falls= Forest Paper Company (left) and Camp Hammond (right), viewed from the top of the Meeting House on Hillside Street, looking east over Main Street's intersection with Elm Street Forest Paper Company, looking northwest to Elm Street Remnants of mill foundations at the falls The Third (or Baker) Falls were, by far, the most industrious of the four. The first buildings ‚Äî Jeremiah Baker's grist mill, a carding mill and a nail mill ‚Äî went up in 1805 between Bridge Street and East Elm Street on the eastern side of the river. On the western (or town) side of the river was a scythe and axe factory owned by Joseph C. Batchelder. Benjamin Gooch's fulling mill followed in 1830, but it later moved to the Fourth Falls. The Yarmouth Paper Company, which produced paper pulp, was built in 1864. The main access road to it was an extended version of today's Mill Street, off Main Street. The original building burned in 1870. Two years later, a soda pulp mill ‚Äî named C.D. Brown Paper Company ‚Äî was built, to which Samuel Dennis Warren\\"Sappi North America formally dropping the S.D. Warren Co. name\\" - Portland Press Herald, September 5, 2018 and George Warren Hammond bought the rights in 1874 and renamed it the Forest Paper Company. Beginning with a single wooden building, the facility expanded to ten buildings covering as many acres, including a span over the river to Factory Island. Two bridges to it were also constructed. In 1909, it was the largest such mill in the world, employing 275 people. The mill used of poplar each year, which meant mounds of logs were constantly in view beside Mill Street. Six railroad spurs extended from the tracks running behind Main Street to the Forest Paper Company, traversing today's Royal River Park. Rail cars delivered logs, coal, soda and chlorine to the mill and carried pulp away. The mill closed in 1923, when import restrictions on pulp were lifted and Swedish pulp became a cheaper option. The mill burned in 1931, leaving charred remains on the site until the development of the Royal River Park in the early 1980s. In 1971, the Marine Corps Reserve tore down the old factory, before a Navy demolition team used fourteen cases of dynamite to raze the remains. Most of the remaining debris was crushed and used as fill for the park but several remnants of the building are still visible today. =The Fourth Falls= Also known as Upper Falls or Gooch's Falls. An iron refinery, the Forest Forge, occupied a spot nearby as early as 1753. After its demise, a large double sawmill was built on the dam by a company composed of Gooches, Pratts, Sargents, Cutters and Bakers, which was a prosperous establishment for many years. \\"That's what I was aiming for,\\" Maren Madsen Christensen wrote in her memoir, From Jutland‚Äôs Brown Heather to the Land Across the Sea. Christensen died in 1965, aged about 93. She is buried in Yarmouth's Riverside Cemetery alongside her husband, Christian, and two of their four children ‚Äî son Einar and daughter Gloria. (Einar served in the United States Army; Gloria in the U.S. Navy.) Another, daughter Marie, is buried in Walnut Hill Cemetery in North Yarmouth alongside her husband, Ernest Hayes Allen. Another daughter, Thora, married Sidney Maurice Hamilton. They are at rest in Evergreen Cemetery in Portland.

Hall (Arcadia, 2002), p.101 Here at the northern end of the Royal River Park once stood Charles H. Weston's machine shop and foundry, which, from 1876 to 1892, manufactured equipment for cotton and woolen mills, turbine water wheels, steam engines and a wide variety of machinery for customers all over the world. (In 1887, Weston was one of the incorporators of Pumgustuk Water Company. This became Yarmouth Water Company in 1895, and Yarmouth Water District in 1923.)\\"Water Works History\\"\\"A Brief History of Public Water in Yarmouth, Maine\\" - Yarmouth Water District The stone wall inside the History Center is original to the Water District building. A water tower with a tank capacity of a quarter of a million gallons was erected off West Elm Street. Its functionality was replaced in 1964 with a million-gallon standpipe. Later, a large building housed, in turn, a tannery, three shoe-manufacturing companies and a poultry-processing plant. These business took advantage of the Fourth Falls' water supply directly behind the building to provide power. Joseph Hodsdon arrived in Yarmouth in 1880 and took over the Farris tannery. Hodsdon Brothers & Company, which operated between 1880 and 1901, made ladies' and misses' boots and shoes. The Sportocasin Company occupied it between 1923 and 1927. Fifty employees made shoes with completely twistable soles to follow a golfer's foot in any direction. The company was later bought by the Morrison and Bennett Shoe Company and reorganized as the Abbott Company. That company manufactured the ski shoes used on Commander Richard E. Byrd's first Antarctic expedition. Glick Brothers Poultry Processing Plant began in 1940 and ran for 25 years. In 1952, it was the largest employer in Yarmouth, having sixty people on its payroll.

History  Yarmouth was settled in 1636, although Native Americans had already been living in the area, calling it Westcustogo. Englishman William Royall (for whom the Royal River is named), emigrated to Salem, Massachusetts, in 1629. After serving seven years in the Massachusetts Bay Colony Company, he was provided with a land grant in Yarmouth. He purchased a farm there in 1636, becoming one of the first European settlers of the town. Another Englishman, George Felt, who had emigrated to Charlestown, Massachusetts, eleven years earlier, purchased 300 acres of land at Broad Cove from John Phillips, a Welshman, in 1643. In the late 17th century, conflicts of King Philip's War (fought between Indian inhabitants of New England and its colonists and their Indian allies) caused settlers to abandon their homes and move south. This unrest continued periodically until around 1756. Around 1715, the third, and the earliest permanent, settlement in Yarmouth began.\\"Project Report Reconnaissance-Level Architectural Survey of Yarmouth, ME MHPC Project ID# YPI2018 Phase One ‚Äì 2018\\" - Town of Yarmouth website In 1722, a \\"Committee for the Resettlement of North Yarmouth\\" was formed in Boston, Massachusetts. By 1764, 1,098 individuals lived in 154 houses. By 1810, the population was 3,295. During a time of peace, settlement began to relocate along the coast and inland. The town's Main Street gradually became divided into the Upper Village (also known as the Corner) and Lower Falls, the split roughly located around the present-day U.S. Route 1 overpass (Brickyard Hollow, as it was known). Among the new proprietors at the time were descendants of the Plymouth Pilgrims. The town was incorporated on 1849.

It was established to address the need for a reliable route between New York and Boston initially, and later between Boston and northern locations. There are six of these stones within Cumberland County,\\"Mile Markers Along the Old King's Highway\\" - New England History Walks, May 29, 2013 two of which are in Yarmouth: one on Route 88, just south of Ravine Drive on the western side of the road, and one \\"1.1 miles\\" away, outside 148 Pleasant Street. The local section of King's Highway was (heading north) today's Middle Road in Cumberland, then a right onto Tuttle Road, left onto Foreside Road (where a short section of road preserves the name of the original route), then a left onto Pleasant Street, before continuing its way north to Machias. In 1813, down at the First Falls, \\"the old road which clambered laboriously over the crest of the hill was replaced by a new street along the head of the wharves below the hill\\". This is today's Lafayette Street hill, which drops about fifty feet from its crest to its base.

Exit 15 became a four-ramp intersection in July 2013, when a northbound on-ramp was added.\\"New Yarmouth off-ramp features tighter curve, needs ‚Äòextra grippy‚Äô surface\\" - Bangor Daily News, September 18, 2013 Exit 17 remains a two-ramp intersection.

The two railroads passing through the town are Guilford Rail System's Kennebec & Portland (replaced Maine Central Railroad in 1849) and the St. Lawrence and Atlantic Railroad (replaced Grand Trunk Railway in 1848). A train wreck occurred on the morning of February 15, 1912, near Dunn's Corner (the North Road and Route 9 intersection). A westbound freight train was backing its 25 cars into a siding when a Portland-bound freight train ignored orders to slow down. The collision \\"drove both engines thirty feet into the air\\" and ignited tons of wheat and wooden boxcars. There were three fatalities and several injuries. Despite this, Yarmouth was the last stretch of the Grand Trunk to receive automatic block signals in 1924. The Brunswick Branch of the Maine Central Railroad received a new lease of life in November 2012, when a northern extension of the Downeaster line was opened, carrying passengers five times a day (four on weekends) to and from Brunswick's Maine Street Station. The trains pass under two roads and over three crossings on their way through Yarmouth. They are (from south to north) West Main Street (overpass, just after Royal Junction), Sligo Road (road crossing), East Elm Street (road crossing, just after Yarmouth Junction), North Road (road crossing) and Granite Street (overpass). Trolley cars of the Portland and Yarmouth Electric Railway Company used to run, every fifteen minutes, from Portland, through Falmouth Foreside, up and down Pleasant Street and onto Main Street between 1898 and 1933,Electric railroad route map, ca. 1933 - Maine Memory Network when the advent of the automobile made rail travel a less convenient option. Underwood Spring Park in Falmouth Foreside, with its open-air theater, casino and gazebo, was a popular gathering spot serviced by the trolley cars. The theater only existed for eight years, burning down in 1907.\\"Derailed Trolleys, Yarmouth, ca. 1925\\" - Maine Memory Network In 1906, a bridge was built over the Royal River, connecting the Brunswick and Portland trolleys at the Grand Trunk depot in town. The tracks ran down what is today's walkers' path to the Rowe School. The pedestrian bridge in the Royal River Park is built on old abutments for a trolley line which ran between Yarmouth and Freeport between 1906 and 1933. Bus The only bus route that services the town is Greater Portland Metro‚Äôs BREEZ. It has eleven southbound services to Portland and twelve northbound services to Brunswick on weekdays and an abbreviated Saturday schedule. There is no service on Sundays. On weekdays, the first southbound service arrives in Yarmouth at around 6.20 AM and the last one at around 8.45 PM. The first northbound service arrives at around 6.45 AM and the last one at around 9.50 PM. On weekends, the first of six southbound services arrives at around 9.45 AM and the last one at around 8.55 PM. The first of seven northbound services arrives at around 8.30 AM and the last one at around 10.00 PM. There are three bus stop locations: the park and ride lot at the southbound exit 15 ramp of I-295, on Main Street in front of Yarmouth Town Hall, and on either side of Route 1 at Hannaford.

It is named after 15-year-old Yarmouth High School sophomore Elizabeth Ann \\"Beth\\" Condon, who was killed by drunk driver Martha Burke on August 28, 1993, as she walked along Route 1 with her boyfriend, James Young, having just been to a video store in Yarmouth Marketplace. Burke's car swerved into the breakdown lane, and while Young managed to avoid the car, Condon was hit and thrown 65 feet over the guardrail and down an embankment. Burke pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was sentenced to twelve years, with eight years suspended. The first section of the pathway was begun in 1997 and cost $100,000. 80% of this was funded by the Maine Department of Transportation. This original part runs north from Lane's Crossing parallel to Route 1 and ends at the parking lot of the town hall. It is at this juncture, where Condon died, that a butterfly garden was built in her honor. It was rededicated on August 2, 2014, a few weeks before the 21st anniversary of her death.\\"Condon garden to be rededicated in Yarmouth\\" - The Forecaster, July 30, 2014 In 1998, an extension was added to the pathway that took it onto Cleaves Street, School Street and into the Royal River Park, where it intersects with a recreational path. A pedestrian bridge carries it over the Royal River en route to Forest Falls Drive. In 2006, a third phase added a section that took it up to the Hannaford plaza and, after an almost 500-yard gap, a ramp connecting Route 1 up the hill to East Main Street. Talk of bridging this gap, part of which goes beneath the East Main Street bridge, began in 2011, with a planned start date of 2013.\\"Yarmouth may finish pathway\\" - Portland Press Herald, August 15, 2011 It would bring the total length of the pathway to 1.7 miles; however, the traffic cones that were set out along the route on July 22, 2013, remained in place until September 2014, despite a statement that the original plan to monitor traffic flow was to take \\"several weeks\\". The two-lane southbound side of the road was permanently reduced to one at the same time.\\"Pathway with a purpose in Yarmouth: Improvements continue 20 years after Beth Condon's death\\" - The Forecaster, August 7, 2013 The project was completed the following month. In 2000, the pathway was integrated as part of the East Coast Greenway, a project to create a nearly 3,000-mile (4,800-km) urban path linking the major cities of the Atlantic coast, from Calais, Maine, to Key West, Florida, for non- motorized human transportation. In 2023, allegedly, the pathway will be extended about 2,400 feet (732 m) to the traffic signals at exit 17 of I-295, where it will cross Route 1.\\"BETH CONDON MEMORIAL PARKWAY EXTENSION\\" - Town of Yarmouth Churches First Baptist Church There are eight churches in Yarmouth. Four of these are located on Main Street. They are (from east to west): *First Universalist, 97 Main Street (built 1860).

Hall (Arcadia, 2002), p.28 The North Yarmouth and Freeport Baptist Meeting House, on Hillside Street Elsewhere, the North Yarmouth and Freeport Baptist Meeting House (known locally as the Meetinghouse on the Hill) on Hillside Street was built in 1796. It has been twice altered: by Samuel Melcher in 1825 and by Anthony Raymond twelve years later. It ceased being used as a church in 1889, when its congregation moved to the structure now on Main Street. The 1805 bell was transferred to the new home. The meeting house was unused for less than a year. It was purchased for $1,000 and converted into the town's first library and antiquarian society and known as Yarmouth Memorial Hall. It was donated to the town in 1910 and used for town meetings until 1946, at which point they were moved to the Log Cabin on Main Street. During World War II, the belfry was used an airplane-spotting outlook post in the Civil Defense System. Twelve townsfolk per day manned the tower in two-hour shifts. In 1946, the Village Improvement Society (founded in 1911) agreed to maintain the interior of the meeting house. In 2001, the town and the society restored the building, from its granite foundation to the barrel-vaulted ceiling. A non-denominational church service is held here during the town's Clam Festival.\\"Steeplejacks nail high spire act\\" - Portland Press Herald, September 22, 2011 The building is owned by the Yarmouth Village Improvement Society.

It is known as the Old Baptist Cemetery. Two cemeteries are located near the former site of the \\"Old Ledge\\" Meeting House on Gilman Road: a small, half-acre 1731 Pioneer burial ground (also known as the Indian Fighters cemetery), which was the first public burial place in Old North Yarmouth, and the 2.5-acre 1770 Ledge cemetery (some headstones bear dates earlier than 1770, for many bodies were removed from the older cemetery). The family of Captain Nicholas Drinkwater, Jr. is buried in the latter location, in a communal plot also containing his wife, Margaret, his son, Joshua, and Joshua's wife and Boston native, Harriet. Their daughter, Elizabeth, is interred in Riverside Cemetery with her daughter, Alfreda, and husband, Alfred, who died just before their daughter was born. Two other cemeteries in town ‚Äî Riverside and Holy Cross ‚Äî are located adjacent to each other, at the eastern end of Smith Street. It is in the 1869-founded Riverside Cemetery that several prominent early business owners and other townspeople are buried, including Leon Gorman. Holy Cross, a Catholic-denomination cemetery, is affiliated with Falmouth's Parish of the Holy Eucharist.HOLY CROSS CEMETERY The Jacob Mitchell garrison was located at the rear of Holy Cross.\\"Mitchell Garrison\\" - History of Yarmouth ME The dirt path that looks like it leads to the water is actually the original stage road. Mitchell's family lived in the house between around 1729 and 1799. It then became the home of the Whitcombs, whose name is preserved on a street name off Princes Point Road. It was demolished about 1900 and the farm land was purchased in 1916 to become Holy Cross cemetery. Davis Cemetery is located on the section of Granite Street to the south of East Main Street and Old County Road, an area known as Sodom historically. John Davis (d. 1798) is the oldest known burial in the cemetery. Cousins Island Cemetery is located at the corner of Cousins Street and Hillcrest Avenue on the island. There are around eighteen unmarked graves of early settlers here. There is also a small cemetery, known as Hill Cemetery, within the confines of the adjacent Tinker Preserve. Media An early town newspaper was the Eastern Gazette, which was first printed by E.G. Crabtree in July 1886. His office was in the second story of the Vining store. Financial support was not forthcoming, however, and its life was short. The town later had its own page, the Yarmouth Gazette, in the \\"lost but not forgotten institution\\", the Six Town Times,\\"National Newspaper Directory and Gazetteer\\" - Google Books which was published weekly from 1892 until 1916.\\"Looking For Volunteers\\" - Freeport Historical Society Yarmouth news is now reported regularly in a number of different newspapers, including the Portland Press Herald, The Notes, and The Forecaster (Northern Edition).

There are five Takhts, which are five gurudwaras that have a very special significance for the Sikh community. The first and the most important was established by Guru Hargobind in 1609, 'Akal Takht' (the Throne of the Timeless God) and is just opposite the gate of Harmandir Sahib ‚Äì The Golden Temple, Amritsar. While the Harmandir Sahib, or Golden Temple, represents Sikh spiritual guidance, the Akal Takht symbolizes the dispensing of justice and temporal activity. It is the highest seat of temporal authority of the Khalsa and the seat of the Sikh religion's earthly authority. There, the Guru held his court and decided matters of military strategy and political policy. Later on, the Sikh Nation (Sarbat Khalsa) took decisions here on matters of peace and war and settled disputes between the various Sikh groups. The Sarangi singers sung the ballads of the Sikh Gurus and warriors at the place and robes of honour (saropas) were awarded to persons who rendered distinguished services of the community of men in general. In December 2010, the Deccan Odyssey train, taken on charter from Government of Maharashtra, started with the aim to have a journey across four Sikh takhts, with a flight by devout and sightseers to the fifth takht (Takht Sri Patna Sahib). A special train named Panj Takht Special train for the pilgrimage of five Sikh takhts, was flagged off on 16 February 2014. Akal Takht Sahib Akal Takht. Akal Takhat Sahib means Eternal Throne. It is also part of the Golden Temple complex in Amritsar. Its foundation was laid by Guru Hargobind Ji, the sixth Sikh Guru. The Akal Takhat is situated opposite to Harmandir Sahib and is connected by a passage. The building of the Akal Takht opposite the Golden Temple has a special meaning. While the Golden Temple stands for spiritual guidance the Akal Takhat symbolizes the dispensing of justice and temporal activity. In earlier days all Sikh warriors sought blessings here before going to battle fields. During the 18th century while Sikhs were fighting a guerrilla war in the forests they used to gather at the Akal Takht on special occasions such as Vaisakhi. Here the community used to have general meetings and approve resolutions. The Akal Takht is the oldest of the Five Takhats. Takht Sri Keshgarh Sahib Takht Sri Keshgarh Sahib Takht Sri Keshgarh Sahib is situated at Anandpur Sahib. It is the birthplace of the Khalsa, which was founded here by Guru Gobind Singh in 1699. Some of the weapons of Guru Gobind Singh are displayed here.  Takht Sri Damdama Sahib  Takht Sri Damdama Sahib (Talwandi Sabo) is situated in the village of Talwandi Sabo near Bathinda.

Takht Sri Patna Sahib is situated in Patna city which is also the capital of Bihar state. Guru Gobind Singh Ji was born here in 1666 and He spent his early childhood here before moving to Anandpur Sahib.

Nanded is one of the historical places in Marathwada region of Maharashtra State. It is situated on the north bank of Godavari River, in the southeastern part of Maharashtra, bordering Telangana. It is famous for Sikh Gurudwaras and is a town of great antiquity. In 1708, Guru Gobind Singh (the tenth spiritual leader of the Sikhs) came to Nanded, His permanent abode. It was He who preached amongst the Sikhs that there need not be any Human Guru for them after Him and they should take Guru Granth Sahib as their living Guru and there will be no difference between Him and the Guru Granth Sahib. A monument has been constructed at the place where Guru Gobind Singh left his body to merge with the omnipresent, known as the Angitha Sahib (funeral pyre). The Takht has been constructed around the Angitha Sahib, and is collectively known as Thakt Sachkand Sri Hazoor Sri Abchal Nagar Sahib.

It was first published in the collection Poems, in Two Volumes in 1807, appearing as the nineteenth poem in a section entitled 'Miscellaneous sonnets'. The sonnet describes an evening walk on the beach with his nine-year-old daughter Caroline Vallon. Wordsworth reflects that if his young daughter is seemingly unaffected by the majesty of the scene it is because, being young, she is naturally at one with nature.  History  Until that Friday 21 May 1802, Wordsworth had shunned the sonnet form, but his sister Dorothy's recital of Milton's sonnets had \\"fired him\\" and he went on to write some 415 in all.Gill (1989) pp. 209, 390 \\"It is a beauteous evening\\" is the only \\"personal\\" sonnet he wrote at this time; others written in 1802 were political in nature and \\"Dedicated to Liberty\\" in the 1807 collection. The simile \\"quiet as a nun / Breathless with adoration\\" is often cited as an example of how a poet achieves effects. On the one hand \\"breathless\\" reinforces the placid evening scene Wordsworth is describing; on the other hand it suggests tremulous excitement, preparing the reader for the ensuing image of the eternal motion of the sea. Cleanth Brooks provided an influential analysis of the sonnet in terms of these tensions in The Well Wrought Urn: Studies in the Structure of Poetry (see also Paradox (literature)).Brooks (1956) pp. 4, 9 The reference to Abraham's bosom (cf. ) has also attracted critical attention as that is normally associated with Heaven (or at least Purgatory) in the Christian tradition, inviting comparison with the Lucy poems.Page (1994) p. 65 However, a natural reading is that Wordsworth was simply stressing the closeness of the Child to the divine: Stephen Gill references Wordsworth's ode: \\"Intimations of Immortality\\".Stephen Gill (1984) p. 709n The 'natural piety' of children was a subject that preoccupied Wordsworth at the time and was developed by him in \\"Intimations\\", the first four stanzas of which he had completed earlier in the year but had put aside because he could not decide the origin of the presumed natural affinity with the divine in children, nor why we lose it when we emerge from childhood.Dorothy's Grasmere Journal records that Wordsworth wrote the first part of \\"Intimations\\" on the morning of 27 March 1802, a day after writing Caroline's mother, Annette Vallon, the previous morning. By 1804 he believed he had found the answer in the Platonic doctrine of the pre-existence of souls and was able to complete his ode. The fifth line in the sonnet, \\"The gentleness of heaven broods o'er the Sea\\", references the creation myth of Genesis 1:2 (compare Milton's Paradise Lost 7:235, a poem Wordsworth knew virtually by heart), and a similar use of \\"broods\\" eventually appeared in \\"Intimations\\" in stanza VIII The reference to the everlasting motion of the sea in the sonnet recalls the argument for immortality in Plato's dialogue Phaedrus (which also treats erotic love). Directly across the water, these images (and the direct imperative \\"Listen!\\") were to be later echoed by Matthew Arnold, an early admirer (with reservations) of \\"Intimations\\", in his poem \\"Dover Beach\\", but in a more subdued and melancholy vein, lamenting the loss of faith, and in what amounts to free verse rather than the tightly disciplined sonnet form that so attracted Wordsworth.  Caroline Wordsworth  Caroline, born December 1792 (baptised 15 December),Legouis (1922) p. 25 was Wordsworth's daughter by Annette Vallon (1766‚Äì1841), daughter of a surgeon at Blois, with whom Wordsworth had evidently entered into a relationship while visiting France during the Revolution in 1792. The subsequent war with England had put aside any hopes of marriage and it was only during the brief Peace of Amiens in 1802 that Wordsworth was able to visit and to see his daughter for the first time, though he and Annette had exchanged letters in the interim. By this time he was engaged to marry his childhood friend, Mary Hutchinson, a marriage made possible only by the settlement of a debt owed the Wordsworth family. The affair was known to Dorothy and his immediate family and friends, including Coleridge and (eventually) Southey, but kept secret from the public and only published in 1916 as a result of George McLean Harper's researches.Harper (1916) pp. 141‚Äì2The relevant passage in Harper is as follows but that is in substance all he has to say about the affair. In the early 1920s, two early letters from Annette that had been impounded during the Napoleonic wars were discovered in the departmental archives of Loir-et- Cher.Davies (1980) p.55 Other than a later 1834 letter, these are the only letters from Annette that survive (while letters from Wordsworth and Dorothy are lost).Woof ed. The Grasmere Journals (2002) p. 205 The earlier two letters reveal a spirited and charming young lady much in love with Wordsworth, well able to fend for herself.Davies (1980) pp. 55-7 In hindsight it seems that the story of the doomed illicit love affair between Vaudracour and Julia that appears in The Prelude, also published as a separate longer poem in 1820, is an oblique autobiographical reference to Wordsworth's affair.Gill (1989) p. 340 Neither is there any real record left to us of the Calais meeting. Dorothy provides an entry in her journals, but it was plainly entered later and there is no day by day account of the month-long visit, which must nevertheless have been a success given its length.Gill (1989) p. 207 Caroline herself is mentioned only fleetingly.In her journals, Dorothy generally only records letters between Wordsworth and Annette with no other details. Just once does she make a more intimate comment when she characterises a letter from Annette as being from 'poor Annette' (on 22 March 1802) and on that same day she and Wordsworth resolved to visit Annette. On the evidence of the sonnet, it is plain that Wordsworth felt genuine affection for his daughter, as indeed did Mary who was anxious that Wordsworth should do more for Caroline should their circumstances improve. Her wish was granted at Caroline's marriage in 1816, when Wordsworth settled ¬£30 annually on Caroline, a generous allowance (¬£1,360 purchasing power in year 2000 pounds sterling) that continued until 1835, when it was replaced by a capital settlement of ¬£400.Gill (1989) pp. 208, 299 Wordsworth, together with Dorothy and Mary and their friend Crabb Robinson, saw Annette and Caroline just once more on a visit to Paris in 1820.Davies (1980) p. 272 By then Caroline had two young daughters. The younger of these left no children, but the elder, Louise Marie Doroth√©e Baudouin (third name after Dorothy), married the painter Th√©ophile Vauchelet, bearing two daughters from whom the present day French descendants of Wordsworth stem.Legouis (1922) p. 113Davies (1980) p. 341 Caroline died in 1862. There is a portrait of Annette by Vauchelet in the museum at Versailles.  \\"The Evening star & the glory of the sky\\"  Dorothy's journal entry gives scanty details of their Calais visit (though it does offer ample evidence of her remarkable descriptive power) and brings us back to abruptly to Dover following the second of just two references to Caroline:  \\"The Crescent-moon, the Star of Love\\"  Stellarium Dorothy's journal entry references the evening star sinking down in the west across the channel over Dover Castle, as does another of Wordsworth's Calais sonnets, \\"Fair Star of Evening, Splendour of the West\\". In fact on the day they arrived, Venus was in close conjunction with a three- day crescent moon, while Jupiter and Saturn, themselves in a relatively infrequent great conjunction (they occur roughly every 20 years) less than a fortnight before, were close by to the East. It must have been a beautiful sight and Dorothy, a knowledgeable observer of the night sky, must have been aware of it, possibly prevented from recording it earlier in her journal by the poor weather they had experienced journeying down from the North. Some forty years later, six weeks as it happened after the death of Annette Vallon on 10 January the preceding month,Legouis (1922) p. 111 Wordsworth composed these lines which were published in 1842:de Selincourt, Darbishire (1947) p. 14  Sources Notes Bibliography  * Brooks, Cleanth.

Unveiled in December 2011, it is the tallest public art piece in Qatar and the tallest Serra has ever conceived.Qatar Looks to Balance Its Arts Scene in The New York Times, 06 January 2012 It is also his first sculpture to be showcased in the Middle East. Constructed from seven steel plates arranged in a heptagonal shape, the work celebrates the scientific and spiritual significance of the number seven in Islamic culture.richard serra: 7 sculpture at the museum of islamic art, doha It rests on a man-made plaza extending 250 feet (76 metres) into Doha harbour. Background Richard Serra was commissioned by the Qatar Museums Authority to create the 7 sculpture based on the personal recommendation of I.M.Pei ‚Äì the architect who built the adjacent Museum of Islamic Art.\\"7\\" Up: Richard Serra Unveils New Sculpture in Doha in the Artinfo, 20 December 2011 According to Pei, he wanted an artist that would complement the museum and, ‚Äúconnect the aesthetic content of the museum to the possibility of building a public space for the people. The project took around three years between the first contact between Serra and Sheikha Al-Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani (Chair of the Qatar Museums Authority) and the actual unveiling in December 2011, and around one year in the construction phase.The magnificent '7' adds an edge to Doha's gloss in The Independent, 28 December 2011 Design The original concept for the sculpture was an eight- sided, 66-foot (20 meters) tall model. This was amended later following discussions with Sheikha Al Mayassa, who was not convinced with the model. Finally, the revised plan involved seven plates of German-made Cor-ten steel assembled in a heptagonal shape and stretching 80 feet (24.6 meters) in the air. The design was heavily influenced by the minarets found throughout the Muslim world.Qatar‚Äôs culture queen in the Economist, 31 March 2012 A distinctive architectural feature of mosques, these tall spires date back to the seventh century. It is particularly the Ghazni minaret in Afghanistan that was the key inspiration for Serra. Richard Serra also found inspiration in the Quran‚Äôs repeated use of the number seven and the fact that Persian mathematician and astronomer Abu Sahl al-Quhi was the first person to build a seven-sided heptagonal shape. These three elements would ultimately define and focus the project. Measuring ten feet wide at the base and narrowing to nine feet at the top, the tower‚Äôs walls are placed so as to include three triangular openings, allowing interplay between the work and the viewer, and between the space of the outside world and the space of the work of art.America's Master Creates His Masterpiece: Richard Serra's \\"7\\" in Forbes, 21 December 2011 The sculpture‚Äôs steel slabs are made from Shanxi Black Granite and are designed to be naturally bronzed by the elements. Over an eight-year period the colour is expected to change from orange to a uniform dark shade via a process of oxidation. Each of the seven steel plates are eight feet wide (2.4 metres) and four inches thick.MIA Park opens to public on Jan 6 in the Gulf Times, 04 January 2012 Visitors are able to walk inside the structure and look up at the sky above. Construction and location Taking more than one million man-hours to construct, the sculpture stands on a small plaza 250 feet (76 metres) from the shoreline. When Serra first arrived in Doha to find a site to build a sculpture, he found a barren parkland along the city‚Äôs corniche, as well as rocks, earth, and rubble from the building of the I.M. Pei-designed Museum of Islamic Art and its adjacent parkland. From these left-over materials, Serra and the Pei team built a crescent-shaped extension onto the water. This pier took over three years to build, with the help of the Pei team and architect Hiroshi Okamoto. During its construction, the pier needed extensive engineering and underwater reinforcements, positioned by a team of deep-sea divers, for stabilization. This the first time that a sculptor has designed the physical location of their site-specific sculpture, as the sculpture‚Äôs site was formerly only water. According to Serra, the sculpture was designed to complement its surroundings. ‚ÄúIt is my hope that the sculpture will provide both a public place and a private space for people to gather and experience the narrow, vertical, open column in relation to themselves, the Museum of Islamic Art, the city of Doha, the surrounding sea, and then sky as seen through the opening at the top of the sculpture.‚Äù.Artist Richard Serra's Sculpture to Anchor Qatar Museum Authority's MIA Park in the ArtDaily Unveiling The unveiling of 7 was attended by Sheikh bin Khalifa Al-Thani, Sheikha Al-Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, other royals of the House of Thani, and more than 700 guests.

THCA is found in variable quantities in fresh, undried cannabis, but is progressively decarboxylated to THC with drying, and especially under intense heating such as when cannabis is smoked or cooked into cannabis edibles. THCA is often the majority constituent in cannabis resin concentrates, such as hashish and hash oil, when prepared from high-THC cannabis fresh plant material, frequently comprising between 50% and 90% by weight.  Uses  THCA is rarely directly used, but its presence is commonly analyzed when cannabis or hemp-based products are screened for THC; some countries require that it be measured in such screens. THCA in its isolated form is available for purchase in select medical and recreational cannabis dispensaries in the United States in the form of a white crystalline powder. It can be smoked or vaporized in typical smoking devices, such as a bong or dab rig (device used for vaporizing hash oil). These methods convert the THCA to THC and so are used for their psychoactive benefits. THCA is also sometimes encapsulated and taken as a supplement for a variety of illnesses, although there are currently no established medical applications.  Pharmacological effects  Conversion of THCA to THC in vivo appears to be very limited, giving it only very slight efficacy as a prodrug for THC. In receptor binding assays it is promiscuous; there are papers showing it being an inhibitor of PC-PLC, COX-1, COX-2, TRPM8, TRPV1, FAAH, NAAA, MGL, and DGLŒ±, and an inhibitor of anandamide transport, as well as an agonist of TRPA1 and TRPV2. Many THCA reagents used in biochemistry experiments are contaminated with THC due to THCA's instability. A study found THCA and unheated Cannabis sativa extracts exert immuno-modulating effect, not mediated by the cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptor coupled pathways like THC. THCA were able to inhibit the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) levels in U937 macrophages and peripheral blood macrophages, an inhibition that persisted over a longer period of time, whereas after prolonged exposure time THC and heated extract tend to induce the TNF-alpha level. THCA and THC show distinct effects on phosphatidylcholine specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC) activity, as THCA and unheated extracts inhibit the PC-PLC activity in a dose-dependent manner, but THC only induced PC-PLC activity at high concentrations, suggest THCA and THC exert their immuno-modulating effects via different metabolic pathways. The anti-inflammatory activity of C. sativa extracts was studied on three lines of epithelial cells and on colon tissue in a model of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), where C. sativa flowers were extracted with ethanol, found the anti- inflammatory activity of Cannabis extracts derives from THCA present in fraction 7 (F7) of the extract. However, all fractions of C. sativa at a certain combination of concentrations show a significant increased cytotoxic activity and suppress COX-2 and MMP9 gene expression in both cell culture and colon tissue, suggest the anti-inflammatory activity of Cannabis extracts on colon epithelial cells derives from a fraction of the extract that contains THCA, and is mediated, at least partially, via GPR55 receptor. The cytotoxic activity of the C. sativa extract was increased by combining all fractions at a certain combination of concentrations and was partially affected by CB2 receptor antagonist that increased cell proliferation, why it is suggested that in a nonpsychoactive treatment for IBD, THCA should be used rather than CBD. THCA binds to and activates PPARŒ≥ with higher potency than its decarboxylated products. THCA show a similar metabolism as THC in humans, producing 11-OH-THCA and 11-nor-9-carboxy-THCA. Although the decarboxylation of THCA to THC was assumed to be complete, which means that no THCA should be detectable in urine and blood serum of cannabis consumers, it is found in the urine and blood serum samples collected from police controls of drivers, suspected for driving under the influence of drugs (DUID). THCA was detected in the urine and blood serum samples of several cannabis consumers in concentrations of up to 10.8 ng/ml in urine and 14.8 ng/ml in serum. The concentration of THCA was below the THC concentration in most serum samples, resulting in molar ratios of THCA/THC of approximately 5.0‚Äì18.6%. Where a short elapsed time between the last intake and blood sampling was assumed, the molar ratio was 18.6% in the serum. Chemistry It has two isomers, THCA-A, in which the carboxylic acid group is in the 1 position, between the hydroxy group and the carbon chain, and THCA-B, in which the carboxylic acid group is in the 3 position, following the carbon chain. In the past THCA was thought to be formed in plants by cyclization of cannabidiolic acid but due to studies in the late 1990s it became apparent that its precursor is cannabigerolic acid, which goes through oxidocyclization through the actions of the enzyme THCA- synthase. It is unstable, and slowly decarboxylates into THC during storage, and the THC itself slowly degrades to CBN, found with potential immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory activities. When heated or burned, as when cannabis is smoked or included in baked goods, the decarboxylation is rapid but not complete; THCA is detectable in people who smoke or otherwise consume cannabis. Legal status THCA is not scheduled by the United Nations' Convention on Psychotropic Substances.Convention on Psychotropic Substances, 1971 United States THCA is not scheduled at the federal level in the United States,¬ß1308.11 Schedule I. but it is possible that THCA could legally be considered an analog of THC and sales or possession could potentially be prosecuted under the Federal Analogue Act.Erowid Analog Law Vault : Federal Controlled Substance Analogue Act Summary In practice, because THCA spontaneously decarboxylates to form THC, no real sample of purified THCA will be completely free of THC. Thus, any laboratory analysis of THCA using any technique involving significant heat will generate THC in the handling and analytical process.

The population was 1,168 at the 2010 census. Rangeley is the center of the Rangeley Lakes Region, a resort area. The town includes the villages of Oquossoc, Haines Landing and South Rangeley. History It is named after an Englishman, Squire James Rangeley, who inherited a tract bought from Massachusetts in 1796 by his father. He arrived in 1825 to establish an estate based on the English system of landlord and tenants, also giving extensive land to settlers. He built a sawmill, a gristmill, a two-story mansion, and a ten-mile (16 km) road to connect his property with the rest of the world. Rangeley resided here for 15 years, then sold the property and moved to Portland. Farms produced hay, wheat, oats, barley and potatoes, with cattle grazing the hills. Logging became a principal industry, with booms of logs towed by steamboat across the Rangeley lakes, then guided down rivers in log drives. On March 29, 1855, the town of Rangeley was set off and incorporated from a portion of Rangeley Plantation. By 1870, the population was 313. In 1886, it had twenty dwellings, two hotels, two stores and a post office. Industries included a carriage shop, two blacksmith shops, a boat builder's shop, a sawmill and a shoe shop. The Phillips and Rangeley Railroad, a narrow gauge common carrier, opened in 1891, becoming part of the Sandy River and Rangeley Lakes Railroad in 1908. Timber and other goods were shipped to markets, and tourists arrived from Boston; Hartford; New York City; and Philadelphia. Consequently, the region developed in the 1900s into a seasonal resort area with camps, cabins, summer homes, inns and hotels. The cool mountain climate and abundance of sport fishing made this a highly desirable and exclusive resort destination. Some inhabitants became fishing guides, and among the anglers was President Herbert Hoover. The big hotels would decline, however, with the end of the railroad and invention of the automobile and proliferation of roads leading to vacationers building personal camps. In 1958, The Rangeley Lake House was razed. But smaller motels and camp rentals have taken their place, and Rangeley remains a popular resort.Rangeley Lakes History File:Main Street, Rangeley, ME.jpgMain Street c. 1915 File:Public Library, Rangeley, ME.jpgPublic Library c. 1912 File:Boardwalk to Rangeley Lake House, Rangeley, ME.jpgThe boardwalk c. 1920 Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Climate This climatic region has large seasonal temperature differences, with warm (and often humid) summers and cold (sometimes severely cold) winters. According to the K√∂ppen Climate Classification system, Rangeley has a humid continental climate, abbreviated \\"Dfb\\" on climate maps.Climate Summary for Rangeley, Maine Similar to the rest of New England, snowfall is high in Rangeley, but due to the cold mean temperatures in winter, it remains on the ground for several months. Summer temperatures are moderated by the elevation and are thus cooler than other nearby towns.

The charter of the church was recognized by law (Law 4149/1961) by the Greek state in 1961, some 50 years after the island's incorporation into Greece. In 1962, the Ecumenical Patriarchate elevated the island's bishoprics to metropolises, and in 1967, the Metropolitan of Crete was promoted to Archbishop. The patriarchate nominates the island's presiding bishop from a list of three Cretan bishops prepared by the Greek Ministry of National Education and Religious Affairs, but the church's affairs, including the nomination of the other bishops, are otherwise handled by the Holy Provincial Synod of Crete. The link with the Patriarchate ensures less opposition to ecumenism than generally expressed in the mainland Church of Greece.

The tour consisted of a first-class game against an invitational Pakistani Cricket board XI, followed by two Test matches and three One Day International games. The hosts and tourists shared honours in the Test series, drawing 1‚Äì1, though Pakistan won with only a narrow 44-run margin in the first Test, and lost the second by an innings and ten runs. New Zealand's Stephen Fleming enjoyed a successful series with the bat, scoring 182 runs at 60.66 in the Test series and 172 runs at 86.00 in the ODI matches, though the rest of the New Zealand batting line-up were said by the New Zealand press to have let the side down with the bat during the Test matches. Nathan Astle, questioned over his place during the tour, redeemed himself with a half century in the final ODI match to alleviate heavy media pressure. Three Pakistan batsmen ‚Äì Mohammad Wasim, Saeed Anwar and Ijaz Ahmed ‚Äì all hit Test centuries. Ahmed also topped the Pakistan ODI batting averages. Mushtaq Ahmed was the most prolific wicket taker in the Test matches, with 18 wickets. Fleming and Anwar were both named Player of the Series in the Test and the ODI matches for their performances. The start of the series was overshadowed by political upheaval with the removal of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and rumours of violent unrest in Pakistan. Danny Morrison, New Zealand's \\"premier strike bowler\\" also pulled out with an injury. Background Danny Morrison, the lead strike bowler for New Zealand at the time, prompted concerns for the team's chances when he pulled out of the tour with a groin injury. Seen in this photo at the Women's Cricket World Cup, Sydney, March 2009. New Zealand faced several problems on the eve of their 1996‚Äì97 tour of Pakistan. Initially, over questions of safety, the New Zealand Cricket Board considered cancelling the tour in light of the removal of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and the resulting political fallout. Majid Khan, the then-chief executive of the Pakistan Cricket Board sent assurances to his opposite number in New Zealand, Christopher Doig, that the country was safe to tour. The New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs also conducted an investigation and believed the tour was safe. New Zealand had previous called off tours of Sri Lanka in 1986‚Äì87, and in 1991‚Äì92 five players returned home early, all due to bombings and security concerns. The touring side warmed up with an engagement against the Pakistan Cricket Board XI over 17, 18 and 19 November at the Quaid-e-Azam Stadium, in Sahiwal. A drawn match, New Zealand were dismissed for 171 largely due to Mohammad Zahid's 6/54, with Bryan Young top scoring with 47 but with six of New Zealand's top eight batsman being dismissed for single figures. The PCB XI managed 193 in response, with wickets shared between Morrison and Simon Doull. New Zealand fared better with 211/7 declared in their second innings, built largely around Young's 73, and the PCB XI reached 41 without loss by the close. The touring side's batting, bar the efforts of Young who was struggling with a painful tooth infection, was criticised by the media as \\"in strife\\" during the match due to their collapse of five wickets in eight overs. Some controversy developed over Lahore newspapers publishing speculations that Doull had tampered with the ball. Earle Cooper, managing the touring side, responded with \\"New Zealand cricketers are not cheats.\\" Of greater concern was Danny Morrison, considered a \\"premier\\" strike bowler for new Zealand. He managed only eight overs during the warm-up match before having to retire. Given the strength of the Pakistan pace attack, Justin Vaughan was considered for opening the batting alongside Young following their respective performances in the warm-up match. Craig Spearman's form also came into question after a poor performance against the PCB XI and given his recent dropping from the domestic one day championship in New Zealand. Spearman was later not included in the squad announced for the first Test, while Young and Vaughan were set to open the innings together. Pakistan, meanwhile, announced the exclusion of experienced batsman Aamir Sohail, and hinted at giving a debut to Zahoor Elahi, then playing well in domestic cricket. They waited, however, until the morning of the Test before confirming. Tour match=First-class: Pakistan Cricket Board XI v New Zealand=Test series=1st Test At the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore, New Zealand and Pakistan met for the first Test on 21 November. Batting first, the touring side were routed for 155 thanks two eight wickets shared equally between Waqar Younis and Mushtaq Ahmed, considered premier bowlers of swing and spin respectively. The media believed there was little in the pitch to explain the sudden loss of wickets, crediting the swing bowling ability of bowlers from both sides. Only wicket-keeper Adam Parore managed to hit runs, top-scoring with 37 batting at number three as a specialist batsman. Pakistan, however, struggled also, making 191 around a knock of 59 from their keeper Moin Khan and contending with a five-wicket haul for Doull. Elahi did make his debut, scoring 22. The batting became easier for New Zealand in their second innings, reaching 311 thanks to 92 from Fleming and 93 from all-rounder Chris Cairns, though Ahmed took six more wickets to give him ten for the match, the second ten-wicket haul of his career. The touring side, setting Pakistan 276 runs to win, managed to restrict them to 231 all out ‚Äì despite Mohammad Wasim's scoring a century on debut ‚Äì and took victory by 44 runs. The victory was only the second Test win for New Zealand on Pakistan soil. Doull was praised for his bowling efforts, as were the batting efforts of Fleming and Cairns. 2nd Test One down in the series, Pakistan faced New Zealand at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium on 28 November needing victory to square the series. Batting first once more, New Zealand were again undone by Ahmed's 6/86, failing to 249 all out with 67 from Fleming and a career-best 55 from captain and wicket- keeper Lee Germon as the main contributions. Pakistan took control of the game with their second innings thanks to centuries from Anwar and Ijaz Ahmed, and 78 from Saleem Malik. Anwar and Ahmen's partnership was endangering the Pakistan record for the second-wicket before it was broken by Cairns, who took five wickets but for a costly 137 runs as Pakistan reached 430. New Zealand now on the back foot were again routed for 168 thanks to 7/66 from Player of the Match Mohammad Zahid, on his debut. Only Young, with 61, managed to put up resistance. Described as an \\"emphatic victory\\" by the Daily Telegraph, Pakistan's win by an innings and 13 runs secured the series as a draw. Zahid, the debutant, received much of the praise. ODI series=1st ODI Wasim Akram, who passed 2,000 ODI runs during the 1st One Day International game. He would score 3,717 runs in total alongside the 502 ODI wickets of his career. The Test series drawn, attention turned to the three-match ODI series. The two teams met at the Jinnah Stadium, Gujranwala, on 4 December, where Pakistan took victory by 11 runs. Batting first in a reduced 46-over game, the start being delayed due to bright sunlight impeding the batsman, they reached 228/8 by the end of their innings thanks in the most part to 73 from 78 balls from Malik. This was part of a 91-run stand with Wasim Akram, who passed 2,000 ODI runs. New Zealand, however, floundered at 217 all out following Saqlain Mushtaq's five-wicket haul defeating the efforts of Young, with 58, Fleming and Cairns with 36 each, and a last-minute 20 from 18 balls from Chris Harris. Waqar Younis was noted by the media for his \\"unplayable\\" deliveries during his 2/48. 2nd ODI The second ODI took place on 6 December at the Jinnah Stadium in Sialkot. Batting first, Pakistan reached 240 for the loss of only two batsmen thanks to Anwar's 91, Zahoor Elahi's 86 and Ijaz Ahmed's 59, before a collapse sparked by Chris Harris's 5/42 reduced them to 277/9. Fleming led the response with 88 from 95 balls, however despite a 37 from Parore they were unable to overhaul the home side's total, falling all out to 231 with wickets shared between Akram, Younuis, Mushtaq and Shahid Afridi. Anwar's batting prowess earned him the Player of the Match award. 3rd ODI The third and final game took place on 8 December at the National Stadium, Karachi. Batting first, having already won the series, Pakistan ended their innings on 234/4 composed of a 51 from Zahoor Elahi, 73 from Ijaz Ahmed and captain Wasim Akram's explosive and \\"magnificent\\" 66 from 39 balls. New Zealand, undaunted, began a solid chase and reached the target with seven wickets still in hand thanks to 32 from Young, 60 from Astle (the player of the match), 47 from Parore, 48 from Fleming and 25 from Cairns. Astle, under pressure due to poor form during the series, was praised by the media for his half century, 60 from 66 balls.

The protesters' demands varied, and included constitutional reform, political reform, and socio-economic justice. No permits were sought by protesters, as is required by Bahraini law. The earliest demonstration was recorded at 05:30 in the mainly-Shia village of Nuwaidrat, where 300 people are said to have participated. The marchers were demanding the release of those detained during earlier protests. Police dispersed this rally, resulting in some injuries, and the hospitalization of one demonstrator. Police continued to disperse rallies throughout the day with tear gas, rubber bullets, and shotguns, resulting in additional injuries, and the hospitalization of three more demonstrators. One major demonstration took place in the Shi'a island of Sitra, where several thousand men, women, and children took to the streets. According to witnesses interviewed by Physicians for Human Rights, hundreds of fully armed riot police arrived on the scene and immediately began firing tear gas and sound grenades into the crowds to cause panic. They then fired rubber bullets into the unarmed crowd, aiming at people in the front line who had sat down on the street in protest. In the evening of 14 February, Ali Mushaima died from police shotgun wounds to his back at close range. The government says that Ali was part of a group of 500 protesters that attacked 6 policemen with rocks and metal rods. The government claims that the police exhausted their supply of tear gas and rubber bullets in a failed attempt to disperse the crowd, and resorted to the use of shotguns. Witnesses say that there were no demonstrations at the time Ali was shot. They say Ali was seen walking with a group of officers who were pointing their guns at him. As Ali walked away, he was shot in the back by one of the officers. Later, several hundred demonstrators congregated in the car park of the hospital where Ali was taken. The Ministry of Interior expressed its regret at the incident and announced that his death would be investigated. =15‚Äì16 February = Thousands of mourners participated in Ali Mushaima's funeral. During the funeral, Fadhel Al-Matrook was shot by police in the back at close range, and he died within the hour from his shotgun wounds. The government says that Fadhel was part of a group of 400 mourners that attacked 7 policemen with rocks and metal rods. The government claims that the police exhausted their supply of tear gas and rubber bullets in a failed attempt to disperse the crowd, and resorted to the use of shotguns. Witnesses say that police shot Fadhel in the back as he bent over to help a mourner who collapsed when police fired tear gas at Ali's funeral. Protesters, angered by this second death, marched to Pearl Roundabout around 15:00, and began to set up tents. The number of demonstrators swelled to up to ten thousand by nightfall. Police did not attempt to disperse demonstrators at the roundabout, as Bahrain's King, Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, had ordered that people be permitted to occupy the Pearl Roundabout to express their sadness. Mohammed Albuflasa, a former officer in the Bahrain Defence Force, disappeared after he gave an evening speech at the roundabout calling for national unity between Sunnis and Shia, and expressing support of the protests. The speech was noteworthy because Mohammed is a religiously conservative Sunni Muslim, whereas most of the protesters were Shia or secular Sunnis. The government first acknowledged on 4 March that he was in their custody. In reaction to the two deaths, Bahrain's main trade union federation, the General Federation of Bahrain Trade Unions, called for a general strike beginning on 17 February, and Al Wefaq, the party with the largest number of seats in Bahrain's parliament, announced it would suspend its participation in Parliament. In an evening address on state television to mark the occasion of Mawlid, King Hamad offered condolences for the two deaths, and announced the establishment of a committee to investigate the events of the past two days. Throughout the day, 25 people were said to have been injured, and hospital records at Bahrain's main public hospital show seven admissions related to the protests. On 16 February, thousands of protesters continued to occupy Pearl Roundabout. Witnesses described the mood at the roundabout as \\"festive,\\" with protesters distributing tea, coffee, and food while discussing the situation in Bahrain. Various political figures gave speeches at the roundabout. Elsewhere in Bahrain, a funeral procession was held for Fadhel Al-Matrook, and a vehicular procession comprising around 100 cars was held by supporters of King Hamad. Police did not interfere with these events. Two individuals were admitted to Bahrain's main public hospital for injuries related to ongoing protests on 16 February. The scheduled GP2 Asia Series race at the Bahrain International Circuit was cancelled, after a practice had to be called off due to the redeployment of the circuit's medical staff to hospitals in the capital.

Two hundred and thirty one individuals were said to have been injured during the raid, and seventy individuals were reported missing. Three individuals were killed by police using shotguns. Of these three, two were shot in the back at close range, and one was shot in the thigh at close range. The government claims that the lethal shots were fired at protesters who attacked police officers with swords, daggers, and other weapons. The Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry, set up by the King to report on the events of February and March, did not see any evidence to support the government's claim that protesters were armed. The raid resulted in the destruction of the encampment. In the aftermath of the raid, security forces declared the protest camp to be illegal, and placed barbed wire around the roundabout.Staff (17 February 2011). \\"Riot Police Storm Bahrain Camp; 4 Reported Dead ‚Äì Dozens of Anti-Government Protestors Injured as Authorities Shift Tactics, Raid Encampment ‚Äì 'They Attacked Our Tents, Beating Us with Batons' Says One Protestor While Another Adds 'There Were Women and Children with Us'\\" .

This phase saw the first anniversary protest of the Bahraini uprising, the largest demonstrations in the history, and the escalation of violent clashes between youths and security forces. Timeline=January 20121 January= At the Sitra funeral of a 15-year-old boy named Sayed Hashim Saeed allegedly killed by security forces the day before, thousands marched to decry the royal government of King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa. They were met by riot police, who fired tear gas, rubber bullets, and stun grenades at the demonstrators, some of whom hurled Molotov cocktails back at police. Meanwhile, Bahrain's new chief of police said that the Community Police force, established in 2005, would recruit 500 new officers \\"from all sections of Bahrain society.\\" Bahrain's Community Police officers only patrol the areas they are recruited from, and do not carry weapons, although they have arrest powers. The government touts the new recruitment drive as progress towards addressing a recommendation by the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry to urgently establish and vigorously implement \\"a programme for the integration into the security forces of personnel from all the communities in Bahrain.\\" =6 January= Bruising on Nabeel Rajab's face after the alleged police beating On 6 January, while leading a peaceful nighttime protest in the Fareeq el-Makharqa district of Manama, prominent human rights defender Nabeel Rajab was hospitalized and briefly detained after allegedly being beaten by riot police. Hundreds of people participated in the protest, calling for the release of political detainees and the downfall of the King. Another participant, Zainab Alkhawaja, was pepper-sprayed by police, and a member of the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights was injured by a stun grenade in his leg. In an interview with Al Jazeera English, Rajab said he and other protesters entered nearby houses to escape police who ran towards the crowd. Rajab said that around half an hour later, he left the house and was attacked by Jordanian, Syrian, and Pakistani policemen as he walked toward his car. He claims that they continued beating him even after he identified himself: \\"They said, 'Are you Nabeel Rajab?' I said 'Yes', then they beat me more.\\" Rajab said that a Bahraini officer approached and stopped the beating. The officer then escorted Rajab to an ambulance. According to a report by the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights, activists were prohibited from visiting Rajab in the hospital, and police pushed Rajab's son and took his phone when he tried to take a picture of Rajab. Security forces also allegedly fired tear gas to disperse a gathering in solidarity with Rajab outside of Rajab's home. Rajab's lawyer said that Rajab suffered \\"serious facial injuries\\" after being \\"brutally\\" beaten by police all over his body, especially his back and face. The Bahrain Centre for Human Rights said that Rajab had difficulty walking and was in a wheelchair. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Interior's official Twitter account reported that police found Rajab \\"lying on the ground.\\" Some Twitter users began using the hashtag #mostal8y, a transliteration of the Arabic word for \\"lying down,\\" to poke fun at the Ministry's explanation. Later, the Ministry published a video with no audio showing Rajab after the alleged beating. The Ministry released the results of a full investigation into the incident on 8 February 2012. The investigation concluded that Rajab's injuries comprised two superficial bruises: one on his right cheek and one on his left thigh. The investigation found no evidence to suggest how these injuries were sustained, but concluded that the injuries were inconsistent with \\"a severe beating by a group of officers for three or four minutes.\\" The investigation recommended disciplinary action for an officer who voluntarily came forward and admitted to pepper-spraying Zainab Alkhawaja with insufficient justification. Along with the results of the investigation, the Ministry released hospital images of Rajab, and a longer video of the protest, with audio. The video shows Nabeel Rajab after the alleged beating, and also shows an officer pepper- spraying Zainab Alkhawaja. Opposition political parties including Al Wefaq and the National Democratic Action Society, as well as human rights organizations, condemned the alleged attack. US officials also expressed their concern, and urged the government to conduct an investigation. =8 January= Richard Sollom, Deputy Director of Physicians for Human Rights, was denied entrance into Bahrain.

He said that, ‚Äúour loyal people have demonstrated that their will, despite all events, is devoted to continuing the reform project... Today we will continue this march with anyone who has genuine patriotic desire for further progress.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis won‚Äôt impact the situation, rather it could make things worse, reaffirming the idea that genuine reform is impossible for this regime,‚Äù said Matar Matar, a member of al-Wefaq, the main opposition group. Opposition groups say announcements of apparently conciliatory gestures coincide with harsh treatment of protesters, who continue to confront security forces in clashes largely confined to Shia villages. ‚ÄúThe contradiction between promises and attacks on the ground in Bahrain is too much, and the international community is silent about this,‚Äù said Mr Matar. =21 January= On 21 January Bahraini police fired tear gas to break up a march by thousands of Shi'ites mourning a man whom activists said was killed in custody but officials said had drowned.

Judges at the High Criminal Appeals Court acquitted 11 men previously jailed in connection with the Bahraini uprising due to a lack of evidence. A twelfth man, who holds a Canadian passport, was not among those cleared since he failed to appear in court for the verdict. It is understood he was previously released from custody due to health problems and was being treated in hospital. =25 January= In a statement, February 14 Youth Coalition condemned \\"international community silence and double-standard approach over the countless crimes and violations which have been committed by the regime in Bahrain and the invading Saudi Arabia forces under disguise of GCC Peninsula Shield.\\" They said. \\"This silence has been interpreted by the regime in Bahrain as an approval to use brutal methods to crush the peaceful revolution and crackdown on political activists. Our people have had enough and it is time for us to assert to our right for self-defense and give up on a community that has proven it acts only when its selfish interests are threatened. Therefore, we hold the international community fully responsible for any dangerous escalation that might happen in the future\\". Opposition activist claimed that 3 people died this day.

The game features alien creatures that spawn at various levels of the game for the sole purpose of killing the character controlled by the player. Gameplay Alien Zombie Megadeath is an arcade-style shooter, where each stage has a certain number of horizontal platforms where the player's character can run and jump around. The general concept of the game is navigating those platforms while dodging the enemies. The main weapon is the blaster, used to kill enemies. Once they are defeated, each of them will drop small gems. Picking them up, along with larger gems that appear on the screen, increases a point multiplier which increases the high score. Progression in the game is connected to earning medals that are awarded for specific, progressively more difficult challenges within each stage. There are two types of stages: Alpha and Adventure. In Alpha stages, there is no set amount of time or enemies to spawn, putting the emphasis on survival. That isn't the case during Adventure stages, where enemies need to be baited for collecting their crystals upon death.

Myth  Olifat was the grandson of the god Anulap, the son of the god Lugeilan and the mortal woman Tarisso. Tarisso was the daughter of the octopus goddess Hit. When Lugeleng's wife Hamulul attempted to prevent his union with Tarisso, Hit danced so lewdly that the woman fainted and had to be carried back to the sky, thus permitting Olifat's conception. Olifat was born from his mother's head. Immediately after his birth, he ran away, cleaning the blood from himself on the trunks of palm trees and biting off his own umbilical cord, refusing to be touched by human hands. Anulap warned Olifat's mother never to let him drink from a coconut with a small hole, for fear that the young god would discover his father's identity. However, Olifat found such a coconut and, tipping his head back to drain the milk, saw his father in the heavens. Olifat was jealous of his siblings, believing them to be more attractive than him. Seeing two of his nephews playing with a shark, Olifat out of spite gave the shark sharp teeth with which to bite the boys' hands. His sister Lugoapup identified her brother as the culprit, with the result that the gods decided to recall Olifat to Heaven, given that he was causing too much trouble on Earth. Travelling to Heaven to visit his father, Olifat caused chaos for the gods, overturning their pans, keeping them awake and seducing their daughters. Aware of their animosity, Olifat faked his own death by climbing into the foundations of a house the gods were building. When the other gods thrust a post into the hole he was in, Olifat hid in a specially dug alcove and threw up handfuls of chewed leaves and red mud. The gods, convinced that they had seen Olifat's viscera spurting out, assumed that he was dead and filled in the hole. However, Olifat used the mid-rib of a palm leaf to burrow up through the wooden post and into the rafters of the building, where he banged a coconut shell and pretended to be an evil spirit. The other gods were afraid, but Anulap saw through his offspring's trick and ordered him down. Many attempts were made to slay Olifat, but he escaped through trickery each time. For example, when the gods tried to drown him in a fishing basket, Olifat escaped to a nearby canoe in disguise, and then conned the other gods out of their catch of fish to boot. When they attempted to burn him, Olifat used a roll of coconut matting to protect himself from the flames and escape. The other gods then attempted to kill Olifat by sending him to take food to the thunder, but handing over the meal and enraging the thunder with his impudence, Olifat hid himself in a reed and escaped unscathed. He was then sent to take food to the Fela, a predatory fish. The fish caught Olifat on a hook, and finally killed him. Olifat's father, however, found his son and resurrected him; he then beat the Fela with a club, and broke the fish's jaw. Olifat is blamed for numerous problems in Micronesian life, including sour wine, bad eggs and termite infestations. He is also said to be responsible for the shark's teeth, the stingray's tail and the spines of the scorpionfish. He is, however, credited with the Promethean feat of bringing humanity the secret of fire, having employed a bird to bring an ember down from the sun. He is also the mythological originator of tattooing.

The submarine sank after a collision off the coast of China in 1931. It was widely assumed to be still present in the Bohai Sea, 20 miles off the city of Weihai in China's Shandong Province until American author and scuba diver Steven Schwankert discovered that she had been salvaged by a Chinese salvage team in 1972. Schwankert's work and the history of the submarine and its crew is the subject of The Poseidon Project. The film was directed by British brothers Arthur Jones and Luther Jones. Synopsis The film is about Beijing-based author and scuba instructor Steven Schwankert's search for the British submarine HMS Poseidon. Schwankert was looking for interesting wrecks to dive in northern China when he found Poseidon on a list of unexplored dive sites. He spent the next six years working on the project, bringing together research in China and the UK to piece together the history of the submarine. Poseidon collided with a cargo ship off the coast of China on 9 June 1931. Thirty-one of the submarine's crew managed to scramble into the water before the submarine sank to the seabed 130 ft (40 m) below. But 25 were trapped inside. The submarine hit the headlines within hours because five men managed to escape from the submarine using the new Davis Submerged Escape Apparatus. They were the first people to escape from a downed submarine using proto-scuba devices. The film charts Schwankert's efforts to examine the escape and the accident in unprecedented depth. It also follows him as he uncovers the secret salvaging of the submarine in 1972 by one of China's new salvage teams. The story is also told in Schwankert's book Poseidon: China's Secret Salvage of Britain's Lost Submarine. Production Arthur Jones and Luther Jones shot the first scenes of The Poseidon Project in Weihai, China in early 2009. Several return trips to Weihai ensued as Steven Schwankert came closer to discovering the fate of HMS Poseidon, and the location of the British cemetery that was originally located off the coast on Liugong Island. In China, other filming took place in Beijing and Shanghai. Further scenes were shot in the UK, specifically at Gosport's Royal Navy Submarine Museum, at the Dock Museum in Barrow-in- Furness, at the National Archives in Kew, London, and in and around south London, where the grave of Poseidon escapee Patrick Willis was assumed to be located. Postproduction took place during 2012 and early 2013. The Poseidon Project premiered at the Hoboken International Film Festival on 3 June 2013.

The National Centre of Disaster Management (NCDM), constituted under an Act of Parliament in 1995; was re-designated to give the present name of National Institute of Disaster Management (NIDM) by the Disaster Management Act 2005 passed by President of India on 9 January 2006, History The International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction, proposed with the purpose of ensuring the implementation of the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction prompted the Indian Institute of Public Administration (IIPA) under the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperation, the nodal ministry for disaster management in India to establish a national centre for management and planning the control of such natural disasters in 1995. The Center was later upgraded as the National Institute of Disaster management (NIDM) on 16th October 2003, with the transfer of the subject of disaster management to the Ministry of Home Affairs. The Institute was inaugurated by Home Minister of India on August 11, 2004. Origin and responsibilities The United Nations designated the 1990s as the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction (IDNDR). In 1995, the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperation, nominally responsible for disaster management in India, created the National Centre for Disaster Management. When responsibility for disaster management was transferred to the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Centre became the National Institute of Disaster Management. The Institute was officially inaugurated by the Union Home Minister on 11 August 2004. The National Disaster Management Act of 2005 granted the Institute statutory organisation status. The Act holds the Institute responsible for \\"planning and promoting training and research in the area of disaster management, documentation and development of national level information base relating to disaster management policies, prevention mechanisms and mitigation measures\\". The NIDM has been mandated by the Govt. of India (NDMA ‚Äì as per DM Act 2005, guidelines for NIDM) to be a deemed University and institute of excellence on higher learning and capacity building. UGC has worked out with NIDM and developed a model curriculum for strengthening disaster management in higher education and research. Most Central Universities have envisaged Centre for Disaster Management under their School of Environmental Studies. A core group is being formed with UGC-NIDM to promote the subject at Academic Staff Colleges as well. Training The NIDM works under government's directives to train and conduct periodic checks to regulate effective earthquake and disaster control policies throughout the country with support from semi-government, private firms and NGOs. It also conducts mock drill, crises communication and a hazard hunt exercise among their staffers every two to three months. Recently, Delhi witnessed one of biggest mega mock drills conducted in India, simulating an earthquake of magnitude 7.2 on Richter Scale. The main purpose was to check the alertness and preparedness of various agencies, commuters in the event of a disaster of such magnitude.

LGBT life in Liverpool, England is made up of persons who are either lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender/transsexual. Research commissioned by the North West Regional Development Agency approximated that there were around 94,000 LGBT persons living in the city's metropolitan area by mid-2009  equivalent to the GLB population of San Francisco, making it the single largest minority group on Merseyside. Out of 100 cities around the world, Liverpool was voted number 51 most LGBT friendly in 2017. The poll was taken by the gay community in major hubs around the world. As the location of Britain's first and only official gay quarter, the only LGBT combined arts organisation in the North of England, the UK's most gay friendly university and one of Europe's largest free LGBT Pride festivals, life in modern Liverpool allows many more liberties for gays and lesbians than it ever did. However, up until quite recently the city was often thought of as a 'lesser gay-friendly' destination and compared negatively in comparison to other metropolitan areas of similar size and stature. Liverpool's idiosyncratic culture, economy, and religious culture have long been discussed in the context of homosexuality and often cited as possible explanations for perceived lack of progress, nevertheless, the recent resurgence since its time as European Capital of Culture has inspired a national and international debate and has led to a major new perspective of local gay and lesbian life. History of Liverpool's gay community The history of gay Liverpool is one full of contrasts and contradictions from larger than life characters, legendary gay clubs and relative tolerance, to the anonymous and underground subculture of cottaging, repression and outright persecution. As a commercial city and major port, the history is long and manifold, and can be traced back to Liverpool's height as second city of the British Empire during Queen Victoria's reign. Jack the Ripper suspect Francis Tumblety who had a homosexual relationship in Liverpool 1850s‚Äì1930s Recent research unearthed by Dr Jeff Evans highlights the extent to which gay men were arrested and persecuted in the court papers of Liverpool between 1850 and the 1970s. It was during this period it is known that Jack the Ripper suspect Francis Tumblety had a homosexual affair with well-known author Hall Caine whilst spending time in the city. Tumblety is said to have engaged in 'unusual sexual activities' and became known for his 'mania for the company of young men and grown-up youths', and for despising women. In 1888, he was arrested on charges of gross indecency and indecent assault with force and arms against four men in Liverpool, euphemisms for homosexual activities. It would have been later in the same year he was arrested on suspicion of the infamous Whitechapel murders. During the 1870s, Constantine P. Cavafy lived in Liverpool with his family. Widely considered the most distinguished Greek poet of the twentieth century, his homosexual orientation informed much of his work which included sexually explicit erotic poetry. 1895 saw a high-profile case involving three homosexual men in Liverpool which culminated in the hanging of William Miller, a 27-year-old sailor, at Watson Prison. Miller had been lodging with Edward Moyse, a wealthy local bookshop proprietor, and his young apprentice John Needham, who were both homosexuals. Over time Miller had become violently jealous of the pair and proceeded to batter Moyse to death with a fire poker as well as attempting to take Needham's life. Miller had also turned his attentions on finding Moyse's money. After surviving the attack, Needham was able to raise the alarm, inform the police and positively identify Miller, who was later tried and hanged for murder. In his interview with Our Story Liverpool, a local LGBT history project, the late artist Yankel Feather recounts his experiences of cottaging in public toilets off Princes Road in the 1930s. Due to the lack of openly gay clubs and bars at this time, many gay men visited lavatories as a means of meeting others in secret for both sex and company. Yankel explains how life was still very difficult and how men would make the most of whatever pleasures they could get in life. During the second World War, he goes onto describe how a 'gay identity' had not yet developed and how the word 'queer' was still being used to describe 'difference'. 1940s‚Äì1960s A number of contributing factors at the advent of World War II meant Liverpool had earned itself a reputation as 'gay centre of The North'. Liverpool's strategic importance as the great port of the British Empire brought with it a constant flow of passenger liners and merchant ships and a regular influx of gay stewards, sailors, soldiers and airmen choosing to spend time and money in the city. The general sense that death could very easily be around the corner and consequential 'live for the moment' ethos led to semi-secret pockets of acceptance and development of a vibrant underground subculture of homosexual bars and cottages. Gays and lesbians found refuge in the pubs around Queen Square close to the city's music clubs and theatres in what had evolved into an unofficial gay village, partly down to its embracement and dramatic fondness of the 'theatrical crowd' and already association with 'disreputable activity' since the early 19th century. Gay frequented bars included the Stork Hotel, Magic Clock, Royal Court bar, Old Royal and the Basnett Bar. Numerous other places such as the Black Cat & Bear's Paw existed further out from the main strip. The neighbourhood provided asylum well into the 1960s, but people who patronised the bars tended to be confined to those who were aware of the criminality and comfortable enough being out. Sex between men was still a criminal offence and being gay was highly disapproved of socially. Local radio DJ Pete Price recalled how the gay clientele were still forced to exercise caution when frequenting the area as despite being relatively tolerated by local police, considerable adversity would still be felt. As a consequence, the semi-covert community had adopted its own slang terms and language. The Magic Clock was characterised as 'home away from home' for a lot of gay men, a 'little old fashioned traditional pub with stained glass windows, beaten copper bar top and big brass bar pumps' full of 'Quentin Crisp types', 'camp little queens' in suits and glamorous eyelashes. The barmaid known as 'Babs' was known to be a gay tolerant motherly figure and the straight clientele were very aware of the type of place it was, very often the only place gay people could mix with others who were like them. Regulars recall how pubs in those days closed at 10pm at night and when the alcohol had finished many would continue onwards to house parties. Map of old Liverpool gay haunts from 1950‚Äì1980 based in Liverpool City Centre Cluster of pubs around Queen Square shows centre of Liverpool's original gay quarter Cinemas also provided an alternative place where gay men could meet. The Liverpool News Theatre on Clayton Square and Tatler News Theatre on Church Street were known in gay circles as a meeting place for sex. Closer to the bars, the Playhouse Theatre also had a strong gay element and the gay community would often mix with members of the cast. The cottaging culture was still very much prominent, with several public toilets identified as hotspots for homosexual activity. Public conveniences dotted around Liverpool City Centre had earned themselves nicknames, the 'Wheel of Fortune' and the 'Garden of Allah' amongst some of the titles. Married men would visit regularly after work, recommend busy areas to other men and found themselves dodging undercover police officers who set out to entrap those participating in sexual acts, many were caught and arrested. In the early fifties, the Army and Navy store on Byrom Street employed a lot of men who had served time in prison for these crimes. With their reputations damaged, many had been unable to find work elsewhere. Few places for lesbians existed by the early sixties and they were to a larger extent less obvious in public. Lesbians and gay men had their own separate networks and often did not socialise together with women preferring to meet up in houses. Shortly after the Wolfenden report of 1957 and the beginnings of the Gay liberation movement, articles about homosexuality began to appear in the Liverpool University Guild Gazette. The language and tone was still largely negative with terminology such as 'queer', 'sodomite', 'perversion' and 'illness' still in use in reference to homosexuality. 1970s‚Äì1990s The 60s saw the Campaign for Homosexual Equality formed and by the early 70s the Liverpool branch had formed their own gay society at Liverpool University. The society championed gay rights, organised events, meetings, and published pieces in the university's newspaper to challenge stereotypes and myths about gay people. At national conferences and protests, the society helped to influence the national student debate surrounding sexuality. By 1975, most of the bars that had provided a safe haven for so long around Queen Square had been demolished to make way for the new St. John's Shopping Centre, Roe Street Gyratory and bus station. The Bar Royal on Wood Street had become the 'place to be'. Jody's, legendary 1980's/90's gay club based on Stanley Street, LiverpoolGuests there were heavily vetted on arrival by its owner Sadie and the main door was bolted as people entered. The bar become a hive of activity where students mixed with dockers and glamorous transvestites and transsexuals mixed harmoniously with lesbians and gay men. By the close of the decade, the various groups had separated as heterosexual 'New Romantics' had begun to take over. After a brief close, re-opening and boycott due to rampant misogyny, the bar finally closed when Sadie died in the late 1980s. Interviewees from Our Story Liverpool recall memories of the vibrant 1980's gay scene which included Jody's, The Curzon, Lisbon, Paco's, Reflections, Scarlett's and Sadie's, most of which were based on or around Stanley Street tracing the embryonic stages of the present day gay quarter. Scarlett's and Reflections both served as a meeting place for members of Friend Merseyside, a Liverpool-based LGBT support group which operated a weekly coffee bar, befriending, counselling and switchboard service in the city centre. In spite of the modest freedoms afforded by the bars, interviews reveal how homosexuality was still seen as taboo in mainstream society and how copies of the Gay Times were still being stocked in brown paper bags at the News From Nowhere bookstore, even by the late 1980s. The hysteria over the AIDS epidemic had reached fever pitch whilst anxieties surrounding the infamous Section 28, which prohibited local authorities from intentionally 'promoting homosexuality', were at their height. Indeed, the fear of prosecution under Section 28 had a direct impact on the city, when in 1988, Liverpool City Council chose to cancel a grant to a gay play being performed at the Everyman Theatre. Following widespread opposition to the Act, a co-ordinated 'Liverpool Against the Clause' campaign organised protests in nearby Manchester, whilst debates were had on the extent to which one was liable to be prosecuted for working in schools. In an effort to stimulate debate and in a show of solidarity, Tate Liverpool opened David Hockney's exhibition illustrating C.P. Cavafy's explicitly homosexual poems in 1993. In the 1990s, a series of Gay Prides were held in Liverpool City Centre (see Liverpool Pride). 2000s‚Äìpresent Mersey Marauders FC facing Liverpool City Councillors for the Armistead Cup at Liverpool Pride 2011 In the 2000s, Liverpool's gay community had become increasingly visible and there was a concerted push to take it further, however, comparisons were still being drawn with the greater gay profile of its closest neighbour Manchester, which along with its successful gay village and Mardi Gras, had for a long time claimed to be 'Gay Capital of the North'. Liverpool was often accused of lagging behind and not providing adequate provisions for its diverse communities. It had been a decade since the city had held a Pride of its own while a debate on establishing an official gay district around Stanley Street had begun to gather momentum. 2004 saw the launch of Homotopia and the first Liverpool Lesbian and Gay Film Festival (Outsiders) which together boasted an ambitious programme of LGBT culture across the city. Homotopia's Festival Director, Gary Everett, said \\"The City is experiencing one of the most exciting chapters in its history, and I hope that this event will unleash the creative energies.\\" Mersey Marauders, Liverpool's own gay football team was launched later in 2005, whilst city leaders continued debating the Liverpool gay village. The pro side hoped to boost the local economy whilst those with reservations pointed to the fact that a gay district was already growing organically and warned about further ghettoising the community. Prior to the introduction of legalised same sex relationships, Liverpool was one of the first local authorities to grant commitment ceremonies for gay couples at its municipal Register office. Despite not granting legal rights at the time, in 2005, the city became the first ever UK local authority to include a gay couple on the front cover of its civil ceremony promotional material. A report in 2006 into the experience of LGBTQ+ people living, working, studying and socialising in Liverpool found that of the 210 that took part in the survey 59% had experienced homophobic crime within the Liverpool area. This was significantly higher than in London which reported a hate incidence rate of 47%.A decade after gay teen Michael Causer's murder, is hate crime rising?. BBC Three. Published 10 August 2018.

Retrieved 13 August 2018. European Capital of Culture In 2008, Liverpool held the yearlong title as European Capital of Culture and with the cultural credentials of the city under the spotlight, the LGBT community had begun to question its place in the overall context. Liverpool had successfully celebrated Homotopia and Outsiders for several years, but questions were still being raised as to how 'gay friendly' the area was and why the city was still the largest in Britain to not hold a Pride. The complexities associated with Liverpool were under scrutiny and reasons as to why the city had not moved forward were explored. Theories included that the city was 'old fashioned, shackled by nostalgia, rough, macho, and submerged by Roman Catholicism'. Candlelit Vigil for James Parkes on Stanley Street, October 2009 Later that year, Liverpool's LGBT Network was established and brought together local individuals and organisations. The venture intended the gay community to be more visible, inclusive and gain a greater role in local decisions. Its key campaigns were to develop Liverpool Pride as well as tackling homophobia in the region. Michael Causer and James Parkes attacks In the same year Liverpool celebrated Capital of Culture, the homophobic murder of 18-year-old Michael Causer brought national attention to the city. Shocked and outraged by the acquittal of Gavin Alker, who was said to have played a critical role in the murder, the LGBT community organised a protest outside Liverpool Crown Court. Headed by the Causer family, protestors reacted angrily amid the backdrop of placards, remembrance photos, and rainbow flags. The following year in 2009, the community was again plunged into exasperation after gay trainee police officer James Parkes was left fighting for his life after an attack by 20 teenage youths in the heart of the gay quarter. A candlelit vigil attended by 2500 people was held on Stanley Street with James' boyfriend, local community leaders, and Louise Ellman MP as speakers. The wider implications of these high-profile attacks have since been felt, not least through helping to galvanise the community by bringing together various disparate groups and organisations, but also causing a shift in attitude at municipal authority level. Merseyside Police have since been voted amongst the top 3 most gay friendly police forces in the UK by Stonewall, and in 2012 the city gained international recognition by becoming the world's first to mark IDAHO with a programme of free events. Moreover, the city now marks IDAHO every year by flying the rainbow flag from prominent buildings in the city centre. A growing gay community Aunty Marlene wins \\"Drag Queen of the year\\" at Liverpool Seen Awards, 2011 The last couple of years have seen enormous strides in raising the profile of Liverpool's LGBT community. The second official Liverpool Pride in 2011 was attended by over 40,000 people and firmly established it as one of Europe's largest free Gay Pride festivals, generating over ¬£2.6 million for the local economy. Moreover, Liverpool City Council made the decision to officially recognise the Stanley Street district as Liverpool's official gay quarter and signposted the area with street signs emblazoned with the rainbow flag, making it the first UK city to mark a gay quarter in this way. The City Council hopes to make the area an international tourist attraction and is planning extensive regeneration and investment over the next few years. The city was the location for a pivotal moment in the history of the gay rights movement as the Liberal Democrats became the first mainstream British political party to publicly support same sex marriage, and officially endorsed the motion at their 2010 annual conference held in Liverpool. An exhibition called Hello, sailor! is now on permanent display at the Merseyside Maritime Museum in Liverpool's Albert Dock. The exhibition, in conjunction with Homotopia and National Museums Liverpool, looks at the experience of gay seafarers on passenger and merchant Ships from the 1950s ‚Äì 1980s. Through video, photos and personal stories, visitors are able to gain an insight into the hidden history of gay life at sea. The exhibition is one of the few examples where this history has ever been celebrated in a major British museum. The first ever award ceremony to celebrate the achievements of Liverpool's LGBT community took place on 13 October 2011, organised by Seen Magazine - the city's home grown lesbian and gay publication. Amongst the winners was the Michael Causer Foundation, voted as Best LGBT Charity of the Year. Liverpool also competes against other UK cities in the annual Mr Gay UK beauty competition, with the representative from the city participating in the national final. The winner of Mr Gay Europe 2007, Jackson Netto, was a student at Liverpool University, however, he represented Germany and not the UK.Indian Spice Indian Lifestyle Website Global impact of Homotopia Liverpool is the host city of Homotopia: The only lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans combined arts organisation in the North of England. Homotopia is a month-long festival of gay culture including theatre, film, photography and art, as well as delivering a national and international programme of social justice and education initiatives all year round. In the 2008 festival, attendance figures reached 12,000,\\"Gay culture festival hailed a great success\\", Event Industry News, 5 December 2008 and by 2011 its web-based TV service reached 200,000 people a year. Homotopia has been attended by numerous high-profile figures from international gay society, including Peter Tatchell, Holly Johnson, Armistead Maupin, and Amy Lame. Homotopia also represents the gay community with its own float in Liverpool's annual Lord Mayor's Parade, along with other communities in the city. 2017 and 2018 hate crime levels In 2018 homophobic and transphobic hate crime was at record levels in Merseyside. The levels had been found to have increased dramatically since Michael Causer's death in 2008. Of the figures retrieved by the BBC, more than half of the 442 reported victims in 2017 were under-35, and more than 50 were under 18. There have been a number of theories and factors that have been suggested and possibly contributed to the rise. One of which is improvements in reporting. It was suggested that LGBTQ+ people generally feel more comfortable reporting hate crimes and that police are taking them more seriously. However the number of offenders being brought to justice had not been found to have increased in line with the number of hate crimes recorded. It was reported that only one in five homophobic hate crimes are now solved. \\"Merseyside police told BBC Three there has been a 38% rise in trans hate crime since last year, with most victims aged between 26‚Äì35\\". In December 2018, it was reported that according to data from Freedom of Information responses received from 38 police forces across England, Scotland and Wales, Merseyside has the highest rate of recorded homophobic hate crimes.How LGBTQ+ hate crime is committed by young people against young people. BBC News. Published 21 December 2018. Retrieved 21 December 2018. Liverpool Transgender community Liverpool Trans Pride March 2019 The British government does not officially estimate the transgender population of the UK. Huge disparities exist between defining the community and how the data is collected at national level. A Home Office report has suggested the number of transgender people nationwide is in the low thousands, although this has been contested. Therefore, it is difficult to definitively measure the community on a local level. However, the Gender Identity Research and Education Society (GIRES) advocates that as much as 1% of the population might be experiencing some degree of gender variance at any given time. This would appear to be consistent with the latest NHS guidance. In the case of Liverpool City Region this reservoir of individuals could be anywhere upwards of 15,000 people (or 1% of the current city region population of 1.5 million). However, the GIRES analysis concludes that a significantly small percentage of this reservoir may only undergo gender reassignment at a later stage. An even smaller portion will have already sought medical care for gender dysphoria whilst an even smaller number will have undergone transition already. Therefore, it can be deduced that the number of people in the Liverpool City Region who have sought medical care for gender variance at some point in the past currently numbers in the hundreds - a tiny fraction of the overall gender variant population. It is predicted that this number will continue to increase in time as greater numbers from the trans community eventually present themselves to medical professionals for treatment. Advances in social, medical and legislative provisions for transgender people will likely facilitate this rise. Liverpool is home to a large number of organisations that support the needs of the transgender community. Many of the organisations provide advocacy, advice or guidance in accessing medical treatment on the NHS or campaign for and champion trans rights. Groups in the Liverpool area include In-Trust Merseyside, LIV.FAST Network, Liverpool Action for Trans Health, Sefton Embrace, Spirit Level, The Action Youth, Trans Health Merseyside and TransWirral. Liverpool Trans Pride March 2019 The Navajo Merseyside & Cheshire LGBT Charter Mark is sponsored by local transgender groups and acknowledges organisations that meet certain standards of good practice towards the LGBT community. More than 60 organisations have achieved the Charter mark standards throughout the Liverpool area to date. In 2019, Liverpool held its very first Trans Pride on International Transgender Day of Visibility (TdoV). A Trans Pride march, a number of awareness, education and celebratory events were held in the city. Whilst this was the first Trans Pride, Liverpool has a long history of celebrating the transgender community and flies the transgender Pride flag every year from public buildings on TdoV. In September 2018, Liverpool City Council approved a motion in support of trans people which stated that the council believes \\"TRANS WOMEN ARE WOMEN\\" and that \\"there is no place in our city for hatred and bigotry.\\" The motion came in response to concurrent anti-trans campaigns that had taken place in Liverpool whilst the British government was proposing to simplify the process of legally changing genders. The city vowed to remove anti-trans stickers seen around Liverpool, the Town Hall and other public buildings would be lit up in the trans colours of blue, white and pink and local planning officers would \\"actively encourage\\" developers and businesses to include gender-neutral toilets in public buildings. Liverpool LGBT facts, feats and firsts Over time, the city of Liverpool has achieved an impressive catalogue of LGBT feats and firsts. On no less than twenty occasions Liverpool has been at the epicentre of the UK gay rights movement.

The battle ended with in victory for the city's defenders. The battle The troops of Ahmad Ibn Muawiya surrounded the city of Zamora in July of 901, quickly assaulting the renowned walls of the city. The battle lasted four days, finally resulting in victory for the city's Christian defenders. The Arab chronicles of the time recounting the battle describe the amount of dead and injured as so great that it is referred to as the Jornada del Foso de Zamora, \\"Zamora's trench [moat] Day\\" or \\"Day of the trench [moat] of Zamora\\" (Not to be confused with the Battle of Alhandic 939, which bears the same nickname).Felipe Ma√≠llo, (1990), Zamora y los zamoranos en las fuentes ar√°bigas medievales, Salamanca , recogido por Fernando Luis Corral, Zamora.

A portion of the wall south of the city's main cathedral lies next to a street called Calle Balborraz (named for an old gate exiting the city called the Puerta de Balborraz).

Sykora had two older sisters: Rose M. Sykora, born in 1911, shortly after her parents' marriage, and Clara Phyllis Sykora. He studied geography at the University of Cambridge, where he organized the Cambridge University Band Society. He then studied business and economics at the London School of Economics. During World War II, he served as an intelligence officer in the Far East. After the war he taught in London at the London School of Economics and the College for Distributive Trades. Influenced by guitarist Django Reinhardt, he led his own band in the 1950s, appearing with other bandleaders such as Ted Heath. During this time he appeared on the Melody Maker reader's poll for best British jazz guitarist for five consecutive years and won it twice. He had a short first marriage to Margery Mileham whom he had married in 1947. He married his second wife, cabaret singer Helen B. Grant, in 1957 in Westminster. The couple moved to Suffolk, where their three children were born: one daughter, Alison (born 1961), and two sons, Ian Dougal (born 1963) and Duncan (born 1960). During this time he worked on radio for the BBC. He hosted the popular BBC programme Guitar Club. For BBC Radio 2, he created and presented the programme series Be My Guest, interviewing Count Basie, Bing Crosby, Bob Hope, Andr√©s Segovia, Isaac Stern and Gloria Swanson, among others. In January 1962 he was a guest on Desert Island Discs. In the 1970s, Sykora and his family moved to Scotland, where the couple ran the Colintraive hotel in Colintraive on the Kyles of Bute. After five years he sold the hotel as Helen who had a drinking problem had struggled with such ready access to alcohol. The Sykoras then moved to Blairmore in Argyll, and he continued to produce music programmes for BBC Radio Scotland and for Radio Clyde. Sykora died in Blairmore on 7 March 2006. In 2012, Linda Chirrey and Marc Mason created a documentary film about his life and career, The Man with the Jazz Guitar.

It is a component of architecture and building engineering and is sometimes viewed as a distinct discipline or sub- category. New materials and technologies generated new design challenges and construction methods throughout the evolution of building, especially since the advent of industrialisation in the 19th century. Architectural technology is related to the different elements of a building and their interactions; it is closely aligned with advances in building science. Architectural technology can be summarised as the \\"technical design and expertise used in the application and integration of construction technologies in the building design process.\\" BSc (Architectural Technology) Level 8 - Dublin Institute of Technology or as \\"The ability to analyse, synthesise and evaluate building design factors in order to produce efficient and effective technical design solutions which satisfy performance, production and procurement criteria.\\"Architectural Technology BSc (Hons), School of the Built and Natural Environment, Ellison Building, Newcastle City Campus  History  Many specialists and professionals consider Vitruvius' theories as the foundations of architectural technology. Vitruvius' attempt to classify building types, styles, materials and construction methods\\"The Ten Books on Architecture\\", Translated by Morris Hicky Morgan, Ph.D., LL.D., Cambridge, Harvard University Press, London: Humphrey Milford, Oxford University Press, 1914 influenced the creation of many disciplines such as civil engineering, structural engineering, architectural technology and other practices which, now and since the 19th century, form a conceptual framework for architectural design. According to Stephen Emmitt, \\"The relationship between building technology and design can be traced back to the Enlightenment and the industrial revolution, a period when advances in technology and science were seen as the way forward, and times of solid faith in progress... As technologies multiply in number and complexity the building profession started to fragment\\".Extract from: \\"Architectural Technology: Research and Practice\\", by Stephen Emmitt, published in May 2013 in the UK by Wiley-Blackwell, Until the twentieth century, the materials used for building were limited to brick, stone, timber and steel to form structures, slate and tiles for roof coverings, lead and sometimes copper for waterproofing details and decorative roofing effects. The Romans used concrete, but it was virtually unknown as a building material until the invention of reinforced concrete in 1849.The History of Concrete and Cement. Inventors.about.com (2012-04-09). Retrieved on 2013-02-19. Modern construction is much more complex, with walls, floors and roofs all built up from many elements to include structure, insulation and waterproofing often as separate layers or elements.  Architectural technology in practice  Architectural technology is a discipline that spans architecture, building science and engineering. It is informed by both practical constraints, and building regulations, as well as standards relating to safety, environmental performance, fire resistance, etc. It is practiced by architects, architectural technologists, structural engineers, architectural/building engineers and others who develop the design/concept into a buildable reality. Specialist manufacturers who develop products used to construct buildings, are also involved in the discipline. In practice, architectural technology is developed, understood and integrated into a building by producing architectural drawings and schedules. Computer technology is now used on all but the simplest building types. During the twentieth century, the use of computer aided design (CAD) became mainstream, allowing for highly accurate drawings that can be shared electronically, so that for example the architectural plans can be used as the basis for designing electrical and air handling services.What is a Chartered Architectural Technologist ? As the design develops, that information can be shared with the whole design team. That process is currently taken to a logical conclusion with the widespread use of Building Information Modeling (BIM), which uses a three dimensional model of the building, created with input from all the disciplines to build up an integrated design.

He died following service in France during World War I. Biography Fisher was born on 13 January 1872 in Onslow Square, Kensington, Middlesex, England, the sixth of the eleven children of Herbert William Fisher (1826‚Äì1903) and his wife Mary Louisa (n√©e Jackson) (1841‚Äì1916). His siblings included: H. A. L. Fisher, historian and Minister of Education; Admiral Sir William Wordsworth Fisher, Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet; Florence Henrietta, Lady Darwin, playwright and wife of Sir Francis Darwin (son of Charles Darwin); and Adeline Vaughan Williams, wife of English composer Ralph Vaughan Williams. He was educated at Haileybury and trained as an architect in the office of Basil Champneys in London. His distinctive architectural style showed a \\"singular talent for making his houses appear to grow out of the ground as natural parts of the surrounding scenery.\\" Much of his work was domestic, but he also designed more than twenty schools in Berkshire, including Wescott School and Alwyn County Infants' School, Maidenhead (demolished in 1997) He also designed Wych Cross Place, the residence of his father-in-law Douglas Freshfield, during the early 1900s. His more prominent works include the Maitland Building (1910‚Äì1911) and Hall (1912‚Äì1913) at Somerville College, Oxford, described as \\"unassertive but admirable\\", and the Anglican Church of the Holy Trinity in Rome (now demolished). War service and death At the outbreak of World War I he was too old for active service, but he spent the summer of 1915 working as an orderly in the H√¥pital Temporaire d'Arc-en-Barrois. The hospital had been set up in December 1914 as a temporary evacuation hospital for the French Army, and Fisher helped with X-ray work. He went on to complete his training for the Royal Field Artillery and was accepted for active service from 5 June 1917, serving in the fighting in the Ypres Salient and the Battle of Cambrai. He served as Second Lieutenant in the 36th Division (Ulster or Irish Division), but suffered appendicitis on 17 January 1918 and was invalided home.

Desimone, R., & Duncan, J. (1995). Neural Mechanism of Selective Visual Attention. Annual Review of Neuroscience, 18, 193-222. This theory suggests that the process of visual processing can be biased by other mental processes such as bottom-up and top-down systems which prioritize certain features of an object or whole items for attention and further processing. Biased competition theory is, simply stated, the competition of objects for processing. This competition can be biased, often toward the object that is currently attended in the visual field, or alternatively toward the object most relevant to behavior. History Research into the subject of attentional mechanisms in regard to visual perception was undertaken as an attempt to better understand the functional principles and potential constraints surrounding visual perception Rolls, E. T. (2008). Memory, attention and decision-making: A unified computational neuro-science approach; Oxford University Press, Oxford. Visual search tasks are commonly used by experimenters to aid the exploration of visual perception. The classical view of visual attention suggests that there are two basic principles: the pre-attentive stage and the attentive stage.Rolls, E. T. (2008). Memory, attention and decision-making: A unified computational neuro-science approach; Oxford University Press, Oxford. In the pre-attentive stage, an individual has an unlimited capacity for perception which is capable of processing information from the entire visual field concurrently. During the attentive stage, the processing of visual information corresponding to local spatial areas takes place.Rolls, E. T. (2008). Memory, attention and decision-making: A unified computational neuro-science approach; Oxford University Press, Oxford. This classical view of visual attention suggests that there is no competition within the visual field. Within this theory an individual is assumed to be capable of processing all information provided concurrently. Until recently it was still thought that individuals had a pre-attentive stage. This is no longer the case, research has now suggested that the pre-attentive stage is now limited in its capacity.Rolls, E. T. (2008). Memory, attention and decision-making: A unified computational neuro-science approach; Oxford University Press, Oxford. The attentive stage of being able to process important information has now transformed into what is known as selectivity. The classical view of attention has built the ground work for the recent emergence of two new principles to benefit the understanding of visual attention. The first of these relates to the limited capacity of information processing. This suggests that at any given time, only a small amount of information can actually be retained and used to control behaviour. The principle of selectivity incorporates the notion that a person has the ability to filter out unwanted information. Koch and Ullman Koch C, & Ullman S (1985) Shifts in selective visual attention: towards the underlying neural circuitry. Human Neurobiology 4:219-227. proposed that attentive selection could be implemented by competitive \\"winner-takes-all\\" networks. Robert Desimone and John Duncan Desimone, R., & Duncan, J. (1995). Neural Mechanism of Selective Visual Attention. Annual Review of Neuroscience, 18, 193-222. expanded on this idea. They proposed that at some point between the visual input of objects and the response to objects in the visual field there is some competition occurring; competition for representation, analysis, and behavior. This suggests that attention to stimuli makes more demands on processing capacity than unattended stimuli.Desimone, R., & Duncan, J. (1995). Neural Mechanism of Selective Visual Attention. Annual Review of Neuroscience, 18, 193-222. This idea of competition led researchers to develop a new theory of attention, which they termed the ‚Äúbiased competition theory\\".Desimone, R., & Duncan, J. (1995). Neural Mechanism of Selective Visual Attention. Annual Review of Neuroscience, 18, 193-222. The theory attempts to provide an explanation of the processes leading visual attention and their effects on the brain's neural systems.Rolls, E. T. (2008). Memory, attention and decision- making: A unified computational neuro-science approach; Oxford University Press, Oxford. Function Biased competition serves to prioritize task relevant information to make visual search more efficient.Desimone, R., & Duncan, J. (1995). Neural Mechanism of Selective Visual Attention. Annual Review of Neuroscience, 18, 193-222. A large amount of visual information is taken in at any given moment and there is a limited capacity available for processing. The visual system therefore needs a way to select relevant information and ignore irrelevant stimuli. A visual search usually has a target (e.g. a coffee cup), which is being searched for (task relevant) in the visual environment, and task irrelevant information is ignored. The biasing from neural mechanisms guides the search to logical spatial locations (e.g. the table) and items that have similar semantic or visual features to the item that is being searched for. It has been suggested that more than 30 cortical areas in the visual system are used for the processing of visual stimuli, and that there is competition from objects in the visual field that takes place in multiple areas of this extensive network.Desimone R, Ungerleider LG. (1989). Neural mechanisms of visual processing in monkeys. In Handbook of Neuropsychology, Vol. 2, ed. F Boller, J Grafman, pp. 267-99. New York: Elsevier. The Biased Competition Model Desimone suggested that the Biased Competition Model comprised five main tenets:4\\\\. Desimone, R. (1998). Visual attention mediated by biased competition in extrastriate visual cortex. ‚Äò‚ÄôPhil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B, 353‚Äô‚Äô, 1245-1255. # Objects presented simultaneously in the visual field compete for cell responses in the visual cortex. When two stimuli are presented at the same time they will activate their neuronal representations. The responses will be determined by these two stimuli interacting in a competitive manner. # Two stimuli that activate cells in the same area of the cortex will provide the strongest competitive interactions. # Competitive interactions have the ability to be biased in preference of one stimulus due to many different neural mechanisms. This is called feedback bias. These may include Top-down feedback (for example, one stimulus may hold more situational relevance) or Bottom-up influences (for example, one stimulus is more novel than another). # Feedback biasing is not purely the result of spatial location. Biasing during processing can be due to a stimuli possessing specific, relevant feature. Such features may include color, texture, and shape. # A main source of Top-down biasing derives from the structures in the brain involved with working memory, more specifically, from the prefrontal cortex. Neural Mechanisms There are two major neural pathways that process the information in the visual field; the ventral stream and the dorsal stream. The two pathways run in parallel and are both working simultaneously. The ventral stream is important for object recognition and often referred to as the ‚Äúwhat‚Äù system of the brain; it projects to the inferior temporal cortex.Ungerleider, L. G., & Haxby, J. V. (1994). ‚ÄòWhat‚Äô and ‚Äòwhere‚Äô in the human brain. Current Opinion in Neurobiology, 4, 157-165. The dorsal stream is important for spatial perception and performance and is referred to as the ‚Äúwhere‚Äù system Ungerleider, L. G., & Haxby, J. V. (1994). ‚ÄòWhat‚Äô and ‚Äòwhere‚Äô in the human brain. Current Opinion in Neurobiology, 4, 157-165. which projects to the posterior parietal cortex.Desimone, R., & Duncan, J. (1995). Neural Mechanism of Selective Visual Attention. Annual Review of Neuroscience, 18, 193-222. According to the biased competition theory, an individual's visual system has limited capacity to process information about multiple objects at any given time. For example, if an individual was presented with two stimuli (objects) and was asked to identify attributes of each object at the same time, the individual's performance would be worse in comparison to if the objects were presented separately. This suggests multiple objects presented simultaneously in the visual field will compete for neural representation due to limited processing resources. Single cell recording studies conducted by Kastner and Ungerleider examined the neural mechanisms behind the biased competition theory.Kastner, S., L, G., Ungerleider. (2001). The neural basis of biased competition in human visual cortex. Neuropsychologia. 39, 1263-1276. In their experiment the size of the receptive field's (RF) of neurons within the visual cortex were examined. A single visual stimulus was presented alone in a neuron's RF, followed with another stimulus presented simultaneously within the same RF.Kastner, S., L, G., Ungerleider. (2001). The neural basis of biased competition in human visual cortex. Neuropsychologia. 39, 1263-1276. The single ‚Äòeffective‚Äô stimuli produced a low firing rate, whereas the two stimuli presented together produced a high firing rate. The response to the paired stimuli was reduced. This suggests that when two stimuli are presented together within a neuron's RF, the stimuli are processed in a mutually suppressive manner, rather than being processed independently.Kastner, S., L, G., Ungerleider. (2001). The neural basis of biased competition in human visual cortex. Neuropsychologia. 39, 1263-1276. This suppression process, according to Kastner and Ungerleider, occurs when two stimuli are presented together because they compete for neural representation, due to limited cognitive processing capacity.Kastner, S., L, G., Ungerleider. (2001). The neural basis of biased competition in human visual cortex. Neuropsychologia. 39, 1263-1276. The RF experiment suggests that as the number of objects increase, the information available for each object will decrease due to increased neural workload (suppression), and decreased cognitive capacity.Kastner, S., L, G., Ungerleider. (2001). The neural basis of biased competition in human visual cortex. Neuropsychologia. 39, 1263-1276. In order for an object in the visual field or RF be efficiently processed, there needs to be a way to bias these neurological resources towards the object. Attention prioritizes task relevant objects, biasing this process. For example, this bias can be towards an object which is currently attended to in the visual field or RF, or towards the object that is most relevant to one's behavior. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has shown that biased competition theory can explain the observed attention effects at a neuronal level. Attention effects bias the internal weight (strengthens connections) of task relevant features toward the attended object. This was shown by Reddy, Kanwisher, and van Rullen who found an increase in oxygenated blood to a specific neuron following a locational cue.Reddy, L., Kanwisher, N.G, & VanRullen, R. (2009). Attention and biased competition in multiple voxel object representations. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 106, 50, 21447-21452. Further neurological support comes from neurophysiological studies which have shown that attention results from Top-down biasing, which in turn influences neuronal spiking.Deco, G., & Rolls, E.T. (2005). Neurodynamics of biased competition and cooperation for attention: A model with Spiking Neurons. Journal of Neurophysiology, 94, 295-313. In sum, external inputs affect the Top-down guidance of attention, which bias specific neurons in the brain. Empirical Evidence for Biased Competition Theory Since the development of Biased Competition Theory much research has been undertaken to validate the theory's ideas.Beck, D.M., & Kastner, S. (2009). Top-down and Bottom-up mechanisms in biasing competition in the human brain. ‚Äò‚ÄôVision Research, 49‚Äô‚Äô, 1154-1165. Research has formulated predictions based on the theoretical model to be tested in experimental settings. Top-down and Bottom-up biases have been tested in order to ascertain the legitimacy of their influence on visual perception and competition as described by Biased Competition Theory. These experiments provide evidence for the idea of feedback biasing as described in Desimone's five central tenets.Desimone, R., & Duncan, J. (1995). Neural Mechanism of Selective Visual Attention. Annual Review of Neuroscience, 18, 193-222. Evidence of Bottom-up Process Bottom-up processes are characterized by an absence of higher level direction in sensory processing. It primarily relies on sensory information and incoming sensory information is the starting point for all Bottom-up processing. Bottom-up refers to when a feature stands out in a visual search. This is commonly called the ‚Äúpop-out‚Äù effect.Gleitman, H., & Jonides, J. (1978). The effect of set on categorization in visual search. Perception & Psychophysics, 24(4), 361-368. Salient features like bright colors, movement and big objects make the object ‚Äúpop-out‚Äù of the visual search. ‚ÄúPop-out‚Äù features can often attract attention without conscious processing. Objects that stand out are often given priority (bias) in processing. Bottom-up processing is data driven, and according to this stimuli are perceived on the basis of the data which is being experienced through the senses.https://web.archive.org/web/20190911071717/http://www.psychologyconcepts.com/bottom- up-and-top-down-processing/ Evidence suggests that simultaneously presented stimuli do in fact compete in order to be represented in the visual cortex, with stimuli mutually suppressing each other to gain this representation.Beck, D.M., & Kastner, S. (2009). Top-down and bottom-up mechanisms in biasing competition in the human brain. ‚Äò‚ÄôVision Research, 49‚Äô‚Äô, 1154-1165. This was examined by Reynolds and colleagues, who looked at the size of neurons‚Äô receptive field's within the visual cortex. It was found that the presentation of a single stimulus resulted in a low firing rate while two stimuli presented together resulted in a higher firing rate.Reynolds, J. H., Chelazzi, L., & Desimone, R. (1999). Competitive mechanisms subserve attention in macaque areas V2 and V4. Journal of Neuroscience, 19, 1736‚Äì1753. Reynolds and colleagues also found that when comparing the neural response of an individually presented visual stimulus to responses gathered from simultaneously presented stimuli, the responses of the concurrent presented stimuli were less than the sum of the responses gathered when each stimuli was presented alone.Reynolds, J. H., Chelazzi, L., & Desimone, R. (1999). Competitive mechanisms subserve attention in macaque areas V2 and V4. Journal of Neuroscience, 19, 1736‚Äì1753. This suggests that two stimuli presented together increase neural work load required for attention. This increased neural load creates suppressive processes and causes the stimuli to compete for neural representation in the brain. Proulx and Egeth predicted that brighter objects would bias attention in favor of that object. Another prediction is that larger objects would bias the attention in favor of that object.Proulx, M.J., & Egeth, H.E. (2008). Biased competition and visual search: the role of luminance and size contrast. Psychological Research, 72, 106-113. The experiment was a computer-based visual search task, where participants searched for a target among distractions. The results of the study suggested that when irrelevant stimuli were large or bright, attention was biased towards the irrelevant objects, prioritizing them for cognitive processing.Proulx, M.J., & Egeth, H.E. (2008). Biased competition and visual search: the role of luminance and size contrast. Psychological Research, 72, 106-113. This research shows the effects of Bottom-up (stimulus-driven) processing on biased competition theory. Evidence of Top-down Processes A Top-down process is characterized by a high level of direction of sensory processing by more cognition; Top-down processing is based on pre-existing knowledge when interpreting sensory information.http://www.psychologyconcepts.com/bottom-up-and-top-down- processing/. Top-down guidance of attention refers to when the properties of an object (i.e. color, shape) are activated and held in working memory to facilitate the visual search for that object.Hollingworth, A., & Luck, S.J. (2009). The role of visual working memory (VWM) in the control of gaze during visual search. Attention, Perception, & psycho physics, 71, 4, 936-949. This controls visual search by guiding attention only to objects that could be the target and avoiding attention on irrelevant objects. Top-down processes are not a complete representation of the object but are coarse, which is why objects similar in color, shape or meaning are often attended to in the process of discriminating irrelevant objects. There is evidence that observers have Top-down control over the locations that will benefit from biased competition in spatial selection visual tasks. Evidence supports that observers can make voluntary decision about which locations are selectedJonides, J. (1980). Towards a model of the mind‚Äôs eye‚Äôs movement. Canadian Journal of Psychology, 34, 103‚Äì112. or features that capture the attention in a stimulus-driven manner.Gazzaley, A., & Nobre, A.C. (2012). Top- down Modulation: Bridging selective attention and working memory. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 16, 2, 129-135. Neurophysiology studies have showed that the neural mechanisms in Top-down processing are also seen in attention and working memory, suggesting Top-down processes play an important role in those functions as well.Hollingworth, A., & Luck, S.J. (2009). The role of visual working memory (VWM) in the control of gaze during visual search. Attention, Perception, & psycho physics, 71, 4, 936-949. Additionally, Top-down processes can modulate Bottom-up processes by suppressing the ‚Äúpop-out‚Äù features of Bottom-up processing from distracting from the visual search. fMRI studies have investigated the Top-down and Bottom-up processes involved in biased competition theory.Beck, D.M., & Kastner, S. (2009). Top-down and Bottom-up mechanisms in biasing competition in the human brain. ‚Äò‚ÄôVision Research, 49‚Äô‚Äô, 1154-1165. Results of fMRI suggest that both Bottom-up and Top-down processes work in parallel to bias competition.Beck, D.M., & Kastner, S. (2009). Top- down and bottom-up mechanisms in biasing competition in the human brain. ‚Äò‚ÄôVision Research, 49‚Äô‚Äô, 1154-1165. Multiple studies have shown that stimuli in the visual field suppress each other when presented together, but not when each stimulus is presented alone. Kastner and colleagues also found that directing attention to the specific location of a stimulus reduces the suppressive effect. Increased activity in the visual cortex was also observed; this was the result of Top-down biasing due to the favoring of the attended location.O‚ÄôCraven, K. M., Downing, P., & Kanwisher, N. (1999). fMRI evidence for objects as the units of attentional selection. Nature, 401, 584‚Äì587. Further Evidence Another supposition of Biased Competition Theory, that competition is integrated across multiple systems in the brain (for example, the visual system as well as working memory), is least studied.Beck, D.M., & Kastner, S. (2009). Top-down and bottom-up mechanisms in biasing competition in the human brain. ‚Äò‚ÄôVision Research, 49‚Äô‚Äô, 1154-1165. However, empirical evidence has been undertaken to confirm the authenticity of this claim. Studies have shown this integration of differing brain systems by undertaking neuroimaging research. Activation in the middle temporal area, as well as the fusiform face area was seen when subjects were asked to attend to a moving face.Kastner, S., Pinsk, M., De Weerd, P., Desimone, R., & Ungerleider, L. (1999). Increased activity in human visual cortex during directed attention in the absence of visual stimulation. Neuron. 22, 751-761. The middle temporal area is involved in the perception of motion, while the fusiform face area is involved in facial recognition, showing the integrated systems of the brain in Biased Competition Theory. Ferrera and Lisberger Ferrera V.P., & Lisberger S.G. (1995) Attention and target selection for smooth pursuit eye movements. Journal of Neuroscience 15(11);7472-7484. provided evidence for competitive interactions in the selection of targets for smooth pursuit eye movements.

The book, was a directory, the first of its kind, full of ideas, information and contacts for those wanting to explore alternatives for creating better communities and a better society. Four directories were published on community, education, housing and women. In 1977, Michael organized his first fundraising training and started publishing practical information on fundraising, marketing, management and legal issues for charities. In 1984, looking for a more sustainable source of income, Michael created the first ‚ÄúGuide to Company Giving‚Äù and then asked Luke FitzHerbert to create a ‚ÄúGuide to the Major Trusts‚Äù. This was how the Directory of Social Change started, adopting the principles of social enterprise in structuring how it operated and was funded. In 1988, Luke FitzHerbert became co-director with Michael Norton and together they established DSC‚Äôs Liverpool office. In 1992, DSC organized the first Charityfair.

One of its first appearances then was in an early Tudor period jest book, Merry Tales and Quick Answers (c.1530), under the title \\"Of the olde woman that had sore eyes\\".See in Google Books p.85 The joke involves a woman who asks a surgeon (in this case) to cure her from approaching blindness on the understanding that he would not be paid until she was cured. The surgeon applied salves but stole from the house anything moveable during the course of his visits. Once the cure was completed, the woman refused him payment on the grounds that now her sight was worse than ever, since she could not see any of her household effects. The story was rendered into Latin by the Papal scholar Gabriele Faerno and appeared in his collection of a hundred fables (1563) under the title \\"Mulier et medicus\\".Fabulae Centum, fable 67 His reason for preserving so slight a work was to amuse the children for whose education the book was destined. The moral he draws from it is that through evil-doing one loses the reward of any good one has done.

Stone is a right-arm fast bowler and right-handed batsman. He was born in Norwich, Norfolk and was educated at Thorpe St Andrew School in the city. He made his international debut for England in October 2018. Domestic career Stone made his debut in county cricket for his native Norfolk County Cricket Club against Bedfordshire in the 2011 Minor Counties Championship. Having been a part of the Northamptonshire Cricket Academy since 2009, and played Second XI cricket for the county since 2010, Stone made his first team debut for Northamptonshire in a Twenty20 match against Durham in the Friends Provident t20. He was dismissed in the match for a first-ball duck by Paul Collingwood, the third victim of Collingwood's hat- trick. In 2012, Stone made his List A debut for the county against Warwickshire in the Clydesdale Bank 40, and his first-class debut against Yorkshire in the County Championship. Stone would regularly play for Northants through the 2012 season and consequently signed a new 2-year deal with the county in July 2012. Earlier in the season he appeared for Norfolk in two MCCA Knockout Trophy matches against Shropshire and Wiltshire. Early in the 2016 season he suffered a serious knee injury, while celebrating the wicket of Moeen Ali, which caused him to miss the rest of the season. Nonetheless, in July he signed a three-year contract to play for Warwickshire. International career Stone, alongside fellow Northants youngster Ben Duckett, was called up to the England Under-19 squad for their tour to South Africa in 2013 on the back of his performances for Northants in the second half of the 2012 season. In September 2018, he was named in England's Test and One Day International (ODI) squads for the series against Sri Lanka. He made his ODI debut for England against Sri Lanka on 10 October 2018, though the game was washed out after 15 overs before he had a chance to bat or bowl. In December 2018, Stone was named in England's Test squad for the series against the West Indies. However, ahead of the first Test, he was ruled out of the tour with a back injury. His county side, Warwickshire, later confirmed he had a stress fracture in his lower back, which would take six to twelve weeks to heal. In July 2019, Stone was named in England's Test squad, for their one-off match against Ireland at Lord's. He made his Test debut for England, against Ireland, at Lord's on 24 July 2019. On 29 May 2020, Stone was named in a 55-man group of players to begin training ahead of international fixtures starting in England following the COVID-19 pandemic. On 17 June 2020, Stone was included in England's 30-man squad to start training behind closed doors for the Test series against the West Indies. On 4 July 2020, Stone was named as one of the nine reserve players for the first Test match of the series.

Samuel Dunn's map is large and includes much detail, and is challenging to fully describe it in small photographs or text.  Map details  The primary map is surrounded on all sides by detailed scientific calculations and descriptions as well as Northern and Southern Hemisphere star charts, a map of the Moon, a latitude and longitude analemma chart, a map of the Solar System, a mercator projection of the Earth, an analemma projection, a seasonal chart, a universal scale chart, and numerous smaller diagrams depicting planets and mathematical systems.

This map follows shortly after the explorations of captain James Cook in the Arctic and Pacific Northwest, so the general outline of the continent is known. However, when this map was made, few inland expeditions had extended westward beyond the Mississippi. This map notes two separate speculative courses for the apocryphal river of the west, a northern route extending from lake Winnipeg and a southern route passing south of Winnipeg through Pike's lake. The River of the West was hopeful dream of French and English explorers who were searching for a water passage through North America to the Pacific. In concept, should such a route be found, it would have become an important trade artery allowing the British and French, whose colonies dominated the eastern parts of North America, to compete with the Spanish for control of the lucrative Asia-Pacific trade. These earlier speculative cartographers didn't realize that the bulk of the Rocky Mountains stood between them and their plans.

It is also a potent Œ∫-opioid agonist, unlike the corresponding N-methyl and N-phenethyl derivatives which are reasonably Œº-selective agonists. Synthesis Fusion of an alicyclic ring onto the piperidine so as to form a perhydroisoquinoline is apparently consistent with analgesic activity. Ciprefadol synthesis: D. M. Zimmerman and VI. S. Marshall, Eli Lilly; (1977). Synthesis of this agent, ciprefadol (12), starts with the Michael addition of the anion from cyclohexanone (1) onto acrylonitrile. Saponification of the nitrile (2) to the corresponding acid (3) followed by Curtius rearrangement leads to isocyanate (5). Acid hydrolysis of the isocyanate leads directly to the indoline (6), no doubt by way of internal Schiff base formation from the intermediate amine. Methylation by means of trimethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate affords ternary iminium salt 7. Treatment of that reactive carbonyl-like functionality with diazomethane gives the so- called azonia salt 8 (note the analogy to the hypothetical oxirane involved in ring expansion of ketones with diazomethane). Exposure of the aziridinium intermediate to base leads to ring opening and consequent formation of the octahydroisoquinoline (9). Reduction of the enamine (catalytic or borohydride) affords the perhydroisoquinoline 10. This compound is then subjected to one of the N-demethylation sequences and the resulting secondary amine alkylated with cyclopropylmethyl bromide; O-Demethylation of the phenol ether completes the preparation of ciprefadol (12).

Then a professor at Yale University, Boswell was a specialist on homosexuality in Christian Europe, having previously authored three books on the subject. It proved to be his final publication, released in the same year as his death. Boswell's primary argument is that throughout much of Medieval Christian Europe, unions between figures of the same sex and gender were socially accepted. Outlining the problems with accurately translating Ancient Greek and Latin terms regarding love, relationships, and unions into English, he discusses the wider context of marriage and unions in the Classical world and early Christian Europe. The book attracted widespread academic and popular attention on publication. Reviews in academic, peer- reviewed journals were mixed, with some scholars arguing that Boswell's translation of key terms was incorrect. The book was also widely reviewed in the mainstream media and the Christian media, with some conservative reviewers claiming that it was written to support the \\"gay agenda\\". Summary In the Introduction, Boswell highlights the subjectivity of marital unions, which differ between societies in their function and purpose. He explains his use of \\"same-sex unions\\" over \\"gay marriage\\", outlining the epistemological problems of the latter in a historical context. Noting that same-sex unions have been ethnographically and historically recorded in Africa, Asia and the Americas, he remarks that there is no reason why they should not have been found in Europe. He acknowledges that the book focuses on male same-sex unions, explaining that the historical evidence from Pre-Modern Europe predominantly discusses men, the socially dominant gender of the time. The Greek same-sex couple Harmodius and Aristogeiton were responsible for killing Hipparchus, becoming symbols of Athenian democracy. Chapter one, \\"The Vocabulary of Love and Marriage\\", highlights the problems in translating words describing both emotions and unions from Ancient Greek and Latin into Modern English, and explains that \\"marriage\\" carries with it many associations for contemporary westerners that would have been alien to pre-Modern Europe. The second chapter, \\"Heterosexual Matrimony in the Greco-Roman World\\", explains the multiple forms of mixed-sex union found in Classical Europe. Wealthy men could enter into one or more different types of erotic, sexual or romantic relationships with women; they could use those who were slaves or servants who were under their domination for sexual gratification, hire a prostitute, hire a concubine, or marry a woman (either monogamously, or in many cases, polygamously). In chapter three, \\"Same-Sex Unions in the Greco-Roman World\\", Boswell argues that between circa 400 BCE and 400 CE, male same-sex relationships were treated much the same as mixed-sex relationships, albeit being \\"more fluid and less legalistic\\". He cites historical examples such as those of Harmodius and Aristogeiton, and Hadrian and Antinous, as well as literary examples such as Nisus and Euryalus in Virgil's Aeneid, and characters in Petronius' Satyricon and Xenophon of Ephesus' Ephesian Tale. He dismisses the counter-argument that these men were friends rather than lovers, and argues that the Latin term for \\"brother\\" was a euphemism for \\"lover\\". Moving on to the evidence for consecrated same-sex unions in Classical Europe, he discusses Nero's union with Sporus, Martial's description of a male-male \\"marriage\\" in the early 2nd century, and a female-female union in Lucian's Dialogues of the Courtesans. Boswell argues that these same-sex unions were not \\"imitative\\" of mixed-sex marriage, but perhaps represented an attempt by same-sex couples to \\"participate in\\" the wider culture. He subsequently deals with the introduction of legal prohibitions against such same-sex unions in the late Empire. Chapter four, \\"Views of the New Religion\\", looks at the influence of early Christianity on relationships. Noting that the faith encouraged asceticism and celibacy, he discusses the devalued role of marriage in Christian society, and the increased popularity of asexual marriage. He moves on to look at the evidence for same-sex \\"paired saints\\" in early Christianity, such as Nearchos and Polyeuct, Ruth and Naomi, and Serge and Bacchus, arguing that these couples were perhaps romantically involved. The fifth chapter, \\"The Development of Nuptial Offices\\" opens by explaining that the early Christian Church was uninterested in marriage ceremonies, which were largely left secular; he notes that the Western Church only declared marriage a sacrament and developed canonical laws to regulate ceremonies at the Fourth Lateran Council of 1215. He then discusses Barberini 336, a circa 8th century Greek liturgical manuscript containing four ceremonies for sacramental union, one of which is between two men. Discussing this and similar recorded ceremonies, Boswell questions what they represent, if they reflect homosexuality, and ponders if these are \\"marriage\\" ceremonies, in doing so rejecting the idea that they represent ceremonies of adoption or \\"spiritual fraternity\\". The sixth chapter, \\"Comparisons of Same-Sex and Heterosexual Ceremonies of Union\\" looks at these ceremonies, and their varying similarities and differences. Chapter seven, \\"The History of Same-Sex Unions in Medieval Europe\\", looks at further evidence for such ceremonies in the Byzantine Empire, including stories such as those of Nicholas and Basil, and then examines the Christian prohibitions that were later introduced to put a stop to them. Academic reception Speculum, the journal of the Medieval Academy of America, published a review by the historian Joan Cadden of Kenyon College, in which she described the book as a monument to Boswell's \\"prodigious accomplishments\\", providing an opportunity to celebrate his life and mourn his death. Although largely positive of it, she thought that Boswell's choice of the term \\"same-sex union\\" was unsuccessful, because in its usage it became a \\"transparent euphemism\\" for \\"homosexual marriage\\", the very term that Boswell sought to avoid. She also thought he was unwilling to deal with the views of theorists of social construction, as evidenced by his description of the North American berdache as \\"homosexuals.\\" Ultimately she thought that the book greatly added to the continuing debate on the issue. The sociologist Lutz Kaelber of Indiana University, Bloomington reviewed Boswell's text for the Contemporary Sociology journal. He considered it a \\"dazzling study\\" and thought that Boswell had overcome \\"some very formidable obstacles\\" in assembling his information. He noted that Boswell's main argument relies on his controversial translation of Greek terms which have already been criticised in the scholarly community. Speculating that Boswell's arguments will spark debate for decades to come, Kaelber suggested that even if his ideas were rejected by future scholarship, the book would still be very important for showing how \\"social arrangements and processes can shape and sometimes bend normative perceptions of the boundaries between friendship, affection, and love.\\" Concluding his review, he praised the book as \\"an admirable, challenging, seminal work\\" although lamented that it did not make use of sociology. Classicist and critic Daniel Mendelsohn, himself openly gay, published a scathing and detailed review of Boswell's book in the scholarly journal Arion. According to Mendelsohn, judged as a work of philology Same-Sex Unions in Pre-Modern Europe is a \\"bad book\\", and \\"its arguments are weak, its methods unsound, its conclusions highly questionable\\". Mendelsohn argued that Boswell failed to establish his two basic contentions: that adelphopoiesis (literally \\"creation of brothers\\") was a ceremony akin to marriage rather than a celebration of a ritualized friendship, probably intended for the reconciliation of heads of households, as argued by previous scholars who had considered the matter (such as Giovanni Tamassia and Paul Koschaker), and that homosexual lovers were commonly characterized in the Classical and early Medieval worlds as \\"brothers\\". Moreover, Mendelsohn impugned Boswell's decision to pitch his work at a general audience incapable of critically evaluating the philological and documentary evidence adduced, arguing that the work as a whole rested on \\"a rhetorical strategy whose disingenuousness verges on fraud.\\" The sexologists Timothy Perper and Martha Cornog reviewed Same-Sex Unions for the Journal of Sex Research, noting that Boswell was clearly aware of the social repercussions of his work for contemporary lesbian and gay people. They believed that its direct effect on U.S. political and social thought would be its greatest influence, far beyond that which it had within Medieval scholarship. Although stating that they were not convinced by all of Boswell's arguments, and were unqualified to judge many others, they thought that the book constituted a \\"major work of historiography\\" by bringing many neglected primary sources to a wider audience. In the International Gay and Lesbian Review, Elisabeth J. Davenport positively reviewed Boswell's book, remarking that it \\"appears to leave no imaginable ground upon which his accusers can challenge him.\\" Noting that the book had been criticised before it had even been published by those opposed to its findings, she states her belief that while the case he presents is not infallible, the evidence \\"leans in his favour.\\" Praising his use of footnotes, she considered it meticulously researched, and ultimately notes that it \\"adds both liveliness and dignity to the debate\\" regarding same-sex unions in pre-Modern Europe, as such providing a \\"fitting memorial\\" for Boswell.Davenport 2006. The historian Robin Darling Young disputed Boswell's thesis as well. Brent Shaw has also criticized Boswell's methodology and conclusions. \\"Boswell's tendency to misconstrue evidence extends beyond simple matters of definition, however,to the very social institutions that are central to his analysis.\\" In Shaw's view, Boswell's analysis compares unfavorably to that of Gabriel Herman who studied \\"ritualized kinship\\" in the 1987 Ritualized Friendship and the Greek City. \\"The kinds of words used to express the new relationship of \\"brothers\\" (words that are also found in Boswell's ecclesiastical rituals) were employed precisely because the men often entered into these relationships not out of love, but out of fear and suspicion. Hence the effusive emphasis on safety and trust.\\" Wider reception By July 1994, the book had gone through four printings and sold 31,000 copies, something far in excess of most works on Medieval history. Mainstream media reviews General media reviewing the book in 1994‚Äì95 included New Yorker, The Economist, People Weekly, The Spectator, Los Angeles Times, Boston Globe, Chicago Tribune, Times Literary Supplement, Washington Post, The New Republic, New Statesman & Society, New York Times, and Newsweek. Christian media reviews The book was also widely reviewed within Christian media in the United States. Judge John T. Noonan of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reviewed the book for The Catholic Historical Review alongside John W. Baldwin's The Language of Sex: Five Voices from Northern France around 1200. Briefly dismissing Boswell's work as unsuccessful at placing his interpretations within the \\"customs, language, and theology\\" of the time, he urges the reader to read Brent D. Shaw's review in The New Republic. Writing in The Christian Century magazine, the Candler School of Theology's historian of theology Philip Lyndon Reynolds expressed \\"profound problems\\" with Boswell's positions, which he claims rest largely on \\"ambiguity and equivocation\\" and \\"conceptual slipperiness\\". He is particularly critical of Boswell's use of \\"same-sex unions\\" as a translation of terms like adelphopoiesis, believing that this was an \\"ill-chosen and dangerously slippery term\\" because it has been widely interpreted in the media as an innuendo for \\"gay marriage\\" and therefore lacks neutrality. He also rejects Boswell's argument that the same-sex ceremonies were found in Western Christianity as well as Eastern Christianity, stating that the \\"heterogeneous bits of evidence\\" assembled to argue for this position were insufficient. Traditio, the publication of the Jesuit Fordham University in New York, produced a special issues dedicated to responding to Boswell's claims. On her Christian apologetics website, the U.S. Roman Catholic journalist Marian Therese Horvat pejoratively accused Boswell of being a historical revisionist, claiming that his book was \\"obviously shaped by his personal lifestyle and convictions\\", having been written to \\"further the gay rights agenda\\". Maintaining that all of the Church blessings between two men described in the book were ceremonies of \\"spiritual brotherhood\\" and not of \\"same-sex unions\\", she highlighted the law codes that prohibited same-sex sexual activity during this period, information she claims Boswell ignored. Labelling Same-Sex Unions as \\"bad history\\", she attacked it as a threat to \\"the very soul of Christian Civilization.\\" Subsequent scholarship In 2003, The Friend by scholar Alan Bray was published. Continuing Boswell's line of research, it served as a defence of his thesis, confirming that: \\"For a very long period, formal amatory unions, conjugal, elective and indissoluble, between two members of the same sex were made in Europe, publicly recognised and consecrated in churches through Christian ritual.\\"  See also  *Adelphopoiesis *Homosexuality in ancient Rome References=CitationsBibliography   * 1990s LGBT literature 1994 non-fiction books American non-fiction books Books about same-sex marriage Books by John Boswell English-language books LGBT literature in the United States Books about LGBT history Villard (imprint) books ","title":"Same-Sex Unions in Pre-Modern Europe"},{"id":"35982210","text":"Frank Keem Malcolm (April 3, 1893 - 1973) was a farmer and political figure in Saskatchewan.

The History and Antiquities of Bicester, Richard and Arthur Taylor, London, 1816 The Pope promised Edward I one tenth of the annual profits of every ecclesiastical benefice for the endeavour. A further tax, entitled Nova Taxatio, was levied in 1318 by virtue of a royal mandate directed to the Bishop of Carlisle. The Nova Taxatio was conducted largely to pay for the war with Scotland. The database is reportedly \\"complete or virtually complete for the dioceses of Canterbury, Rochester, London, Lincoln, Norwich, Chichester, Exeter, Hereford, Salisbury, Bath and Wells, Winchester, Worcester, Ely, St Davids, Llandaff, St Asaph and Bangor.\\" Robinson has demonstrated many inaccuracies and omissions in the Taxatio and that it must be exercised with caution as a source. Nonetheless, it remains an important source document for the medieval period. Payment dispute Pope Nicholas IV, who initiated the Taxatio This taxation is a most important record, because all the taxes of the Church, as well to the kings of England as to the pope, were afterwards regulated by it until the survey made by Henry VIII; and because the statutes of colleges which were founded before the Reformation are also interpreted by this criterion, according to which their benefices, under a certain value, are exempted from the restriction in the statute 21 Henry VIII concerning pluralities. In 1295, Edward, notwithstanding the Pope's grant, and numerous exactions from the clergy in the meantime, being still in great need of money to carry on his wars, summoned deputies from the inferior clergy for the first time to vote him supplies from their own body. In the preceding year he had, by threats and violence, exacted a tax of half the revenues of the clergy; but now he thought it prudent to obtain their consent to his demands in a more regular manner. The clergy, however, would not obey the king's writ of summons, lest they should appear to acknowledge the temporal power; and in order to overcome this objection, the king issued his writ to the archbishop, who, as their spiritual superior, summoned the clergy to meet in convocation. This was the commencement of the constitutional practice of the clergy meeting in Convocation at the same time as the Lay Parliament, and voting subsidies by its own voluntary act for the service of the state. It was not viewed without alarm by the Pope and the high Church dignitaries ; and in order to put a stop to all such exactions of princes from the clergy, Pope Boniface VIII issued a bull in 1296, which forbade churchmen of every degree to pay any tribute, subsidy, or gift to laymen, without authority from the See of Rome ; and declared that if they should pay, or princes exact, or any one assist in levying such unauthorised taxes, all such persons respectively would incur the sentence of excommunication. In the same year, however, Edward I demanded of the clergy a fifth of their moveables, which they resisted, on the ground that they could not disobey the Pope; but the king was not inclined to desist, and in order to force the acquiescence of the clergy, he put them out of the pale of the laws. Orders were issued to the judges to hear no cause brought before them by the clergy, but to decide all causes in which they were sued by others. The clergy could not long resist these oppressions; and although unwilling to disobey the Papal Bull, they evaded it by voluntarily depositing a sum equivalent to the amount demanded of them in some church, whence it was taken by the king's officers. In this expedient the whole ecclesiastical body acquiesced, and thus yielded up their spiritual privileges, under coercion by the temporal power. Publication An edition of the Taxatio was published by the Record Commission in 1802 as Taxatio Ecclesiastica Angliae et Walliae Auctoritate, edited by Thomas Astle, Samuel Ayscough and John Caley.

Oliver was raised in rural New South Wales. She trained at Sydney's Alexander Mackie College of Advanced Education and London's Chelsea School of Art. She had early success, winning a New South Wales Travelling Art Scholarship in 1981 and the Moet & Chandon Australian Art Fellowship in 1984. Oliver settled in Sydney, where she practised and taught until her death in 2006. Oliver's sculptures are admired for their tactile nature, aesthetics, and technical skills demonstrated in their production. In her later career, most of her pieces were both public and private commissions. Her major works include Vine, a 16.5-metre-high sculpture in the Sydney Hilton, Magnolia and Palm, in the Sydney Botanical Gardens, and Big Feathers in Brisbane's Queen Street Mall. Recognition of her work included selection as a finalist in the inaugural Helen Lempriere National Sculpture Award in 2000, inclusion in the National Gallery of Australia's 2002 National Sculpture Prize exhibition, and being shortlisted for the 2006 Clemenger Contemporary Art Award. Her works are held in major Australian collections, including the National Gallery of Australia, the National Gallery of Victoria and the Art Gallery of New South Wales. Early life The Chelsea School of Art, where Oliver completed her Masters Oliver was born Bronwyn Gooda on 22 February 1959, in Gum Flat, west of Inverell, in New South Wales. Her parents were Milton, a farmer turned greenkeeper, and Wendy, who worked in a pharmacy. Her creativity was nurtured from a young age. Aged just eight, Oliver attended weekend art classes in Inverell run by Ian Howard, who went on to become dean of the college in Sydney where she would later study. As she was dux of her school, her parents expected her to go on to university. However, Oliver wished to pursue a creative career. When she told her parents of her plans, her mother replied, \\"Darling, your father and I are very pleased you're going to art school, but if you'd been a son, I think we'd be a little disappointed.\\" A rift subsequently developed between her and her family that resulted in her having no contact with them for 25 years. After leaving school, Oliver studied and worked in Sydney. She had intended to enrol in painting classes, but a computer error placed her in the sculpture course: she later said \\"I knew straight away I was in the right place\\". She graduated from the Alexander Mackie College of Advanced Education in 1980. Winning a New South Wales Travelling Art Scholarship in 1983, she then completed a master's degree at Chelsea School of Art in 1984. Her work was influenced by Richard Deacon, Antony Gormley and Martin Puryear under whom she studied while in England. Upon returning from the United Kingdom, she immediately met with further success, when in 1984 she won a Moet & Chandon Australian Art Fellowship. In 1988 she was granted a period as artist-in-residence in the city of Brest on the coast of Brittany, where she studied Celtic metalworking techniques. Personal life In her early twenties, Bronwyn Gooda married Leslie Oliver, taking his surname and later retaining it \\"despite a distressing divorce\\". The artist lived in the inner-western Sydney suburb of Haberfield, where she also had her studio. For 19 years up until her death, she taught art to primary school-age children at Sydney's Cranbrook School in Bellevue Hill. She was a friend of Roslyn Oxley, at whose eponymous gallery Oliver exhibited her works. Her long-term de facto partner was wine writer Huon Hooke. Works and exhibitions Palm (1999), Royal Botanic Garden, Sydney Biographer Hannah Fink estimated that Oliver produced 290 works over a career of 22 years. Of these, public art works are Oliver's best known sculptures. These include Eyrie, created for Adelaide's Hyatt Hotel in 1993, and Magnolia and Palm, commissioned in 1999 by the Sydney Botanical Gardens, as part of the Sydney Sculpture Walk. That same year, Big Feathers was commissioned for the Queen Street Mall in Brisbane. It comprises two large feather-shaped forms suspended above the pedestrian precinct, representing \\"Queen Street's history of parades as well as the mall's connection between earth and sky\\". In 2000, Oliver's piece Entwine was a finalist in the inaugural Helen Lempriere National Sculpture Award, while in the following year, Oliver won the University of New South Wales inaugural sculpture commission competition, with her three-metre- high Globe. Other success followed, when Trace was selected for the National Gallery of Australia's 2002 National Sculpture Prize exhibition. In August 2002 she was one of five artists shortlisted by the Australian Government for a project to produce a public artwork celebrating the centenary of women's suffrage in Australia. By the 2000s most of Oliver's output constituted commissioned pieces, whether public or private. The most substantial of these is Vine, a 16.5 metre high sculpture installed as part of the $400 million refurbishment of the Sydney Hilton. Taking twelve months to create and requiring a budget of up to half million dollars, the work was completed in 2005. The sculpture was fabricated from 380 kilograms of aluminium, and assembled by a team of eight Croatian welders. By 2006, Oliver had held 18 solo exhibitions of her work, half of them at Roslyn Oxley9 Gallery, which represented her throughout her career as a sculptor. Only one of those solo exhibitions was held outside Australia: a 1992 exhibition at Auckland City Gallery. However, Oliver was represented in numerous international group shows, including five during the period 1983 to 1984, around the time she completed her master's degree in London. Four of the group shows at that time were in the United Kingdom; the fifth was at the Museum of Traditional Industries in Kyoto. Subsequent international group shows included 'Five Australian Artists' at Brest's Centre Culturale in 1988, the year she undertook an artist's residency in that city. Later group shows of which Oliver was part included 'Prospect '93' at the Frankfurter Kunstverein, 'Systems End: Contemporary Art in Australia', which exhibited in several east Asian galleries in 1996, and the Beijing International Biennale in 2003. Technique Oliver's Big Feathers (1999) in Queen Street Mall, Brisbane A sculptor for her entire artistic career, Oliver used paper, cane or fibreglass for her early works. However, she found \\"fibreglass hazardous and paper too impermanent\\", and for most of her career she worked in metal. The metals used for her creations varied: the monumental Vine was fabricated in aluminium, as was the Brisbane sculpture Big Feathers; however most, such as Palm and the 2002 sculpture Lock, were crafted in copper. All 25 works included in the 1995 publication, Bronwyn Oliver: mnemonic chords, were made in copper, though a handful also utilised other materials such as bronze, lead or, in one case, fibreglass. Oliver was always preoccupied with \\"what materials will do\\". Fink observed that \\"[f]rom the beginning, Oliver has been interested in things that are made from the inside out, and her works often give cryptic evidence of their manufacture\\". That evidence of manufacture was not confined to the works themselves: friends and art critics observed the injuries and marks she carried as a result of working with such unforgiving material. Ideas were often first sketched by Oliver, before she moved to construction in three dimensions. When preparing commissions, she would draw on the ideas of clients or the nature of the site. For large works she created maquettes (or models), sometimes in plasticine, on other occasions using copper wire or, in the case of her 2002 sculpture Globe, wood and metal. Oliver would produce the more delicate works herself. Many were created by crafting and joining wire to create abstract forms. These were built around moulds, twisting the metal into place with pliers, before severing it with wirecutters. Joins were soldered or brazed (though in some pieces, the wire was woven). In Web (2002), copper pieces were sewn together using wire. Her partner Huon Hooke described her at work in the studio: > She is sitting cross-legged on the floor, on a piece of foam rubber. Her > work is on a low bench constructed of timber covered with fireproof > bricks...The tiny jeweller's blowtorch is in her right hand, the big bottles > of oxygen and acetylene standing behind her. In her left is the brazing rod > and she's making one of the thousands of joints that make up a new > sculpture, the fire licking at the fireproof cement covering the polystyrene > mould as well as curling around the tiny piece of cooper wire which is being > joined. Major pieces were created at Crawfords Casting foundry in Enfield in Sydney's inner western suburbs. Although the foundry would fabricate the elements of the sculptures, Oliver would still undertake the initial stages, training foundry staff and supervising their activity. Some of the pieces assembled to create the sculptures were made using copper rod, while others were formed using the lost-wax casting technique. Individual pieces would take up to two months to complete.  Themes and critical reception  Hilton Hotelalt=A sixteen-metre-high sculpture made out of many aluminium wires, brazed together in a structure suggesting the form of a giant, curling vine alt=A three- metre-diameter globe-shaped bronze sculpture fabricated out of brazed copper alloy wire Oliver was not one to intellectualise her creativity: she preferred to talk about the process of creating her artworks rather than their meanings. Asked about how she approached her art, she stated: While Oliver was reluctant to discuss meaning in her works, critics have identified recurring themes. Hannah Fink, like art critic John McDonald, noted that there is a pattern to the shapes and structures in Oliver's work. Fink described this as \\"a consistent vocabulary of elemental forms ‚Äì the spiral, meander, loop and sphere ‚Äì in a repertoire of signature archetypes\\". McDonald said that Nature is \\"omnipresent\\" and referred to them as organisms or their remains. Despite their organic appearance, Oliver's own view was that her work was not grounded in nature's structures. Nevertheless, critics have identified the lifelike qualities of early pieces that resembled shells, claws or tails, or noted the apparent similarities to biological forms. McDonald commented that \\"For Oliver to deny nature is akin to Balthus saying there is nothing erotic about his paintings or Rothko claiming his works aren't abstract.\\" Both major reviews of Oliver's work published in her lifetime (Fenner's 1995 essay and Fink's 2002 journal article) draw attention to dualism and contradiction in the sculptures: Fenner describes them as \\"delicate and ephemeral, [yet] structurally robust and durable\\"; Fink sees them as \\"ethereal but solid, fluid yet rigid, open but closed\\". Oliver's sculptures are admired for their tactile nature, their aesthetics, and the technical skills demonstrated in their production. Particular works have been singled out for praise. A writer reviewing Vine in the Sydney Hilton admired how it \\"curls like a fairy tale beanstalk up towards the ceiling as though empowered by the sunlight streaming in from a large open space adjacent\\". Journalist Catherine Keenan's 2005 description of how the towering sculpture demonstrated both aesthetic and production values are typical of comments about Oliver's work: The Sydney Morning Herald's art writer, John McDonald, said of her work \\"It often seems to me she's only got one tune, but it's a pretty good tune\\". He later elaborated: Despite this consistency in her output and the coherent themes of her oeuvre, variety was also present. Critic Bruce James considered her 2002 exhibition, and in particular one small work titled Crackled, to demonstrate a broader artistic range: \\"Crackled is ... formally surprising, evidence that Oliver is not content to rely on a winning recipe of convolution for her concepts. Whole new areas of physical and artistic exploration lay open before her\\". Hannah Fink, reflecting on Oliver's last sculptures, wrote: In 2000, Oliver was included by Australian Art Collector in its list of Australia's 50 \\"most collectable artists\\". In 2005, her work was identified by auction dealers as amongst those of greatest interest in the secondary art market. Death and legacy Oliver was sometimes characterised as reclusive in both the artistic and social worlds. Her teacher and long-time associate Professor Ian Howard described her as having \\"an underlying and at times painful distrust of the relationships that are part of our everyday lives\\". Close friend and gallerist, Roslyn Oxley, observed that she was \\"very private. She stopped people entering her world a lot of the time.\\" Oliver's sister, Helen, had described her as a \\"powerful and fragile person\\" while biographer Fink observed \\"[a] deeply asocial person, [who] nonetheless maintained longstanding friendships with a small coterie of people whom she trusted\\". The final period of Oliver's personal life was the subject of contradictory accounts. Oxley said that Oliver in 2006 experienced the end of a 20-year-long relationship, and obituarist Joyce Morgan, who spoke to Huon Hooke after Oliver's death, described Hooke as Oliver's \\"former\\" partner. though others writing shortly after her death did not indicate that the relationship with Hooke had ended, including an obituary by Howard, one written by art critic John McDonald, and tributes by her two biographers, Felicity Fenner and Hannah Fink. Some years later, author Katrina Strickland interviewed people close to Oliver, and reported they had noticed a gradual deterioration in her personality over a period of years; she became \\"reclusive, obsessive, anxious\\" as well as \\"difficult and impatient, and completely obsessed with her diet.\\" Under the circumstances, Hooke had felt he \\"just wanted to be somewhere else\\" and left the relationship in late May 2006. At that point, Strickland recounted, \\"Oliver fell to pieces\\". Her friend Roslyn Oxley subsequently concluded that, at some point, Oliver made plans to take her own life. Journalist Sunanda Creagh interviewed Oxley, as the gallerist prepared the last exhibition of her friend's work: Oliver committed suicide on 10 July 2006. McDonald recounts that, some weeks after her death, Hooke indicated in an interview that Oliver was \\"a very troubled person\\", but none of the sources offered anything definitive about why she took her own life; McDonald himself concluded \\"we will never know\\". In 2013, it was reported that analysis of a sample of Oliver's hair contained a very high level of copper, nearly 8 times normal. The debilitating effects of high copper levels, which are associated with some mental illnesses, may have been exacerbated by an imbalance created by low zinc levels in her diet, which was devoid of red meat. Just before her death, Oliver had been shortlisted for the 2006 Clemenger Contemporary Art Award. In the year following, Oliver was amongst 60 artists profiled in Sonia Payes' book Untitled: Portraits of Australian Artists, while in 2008 her final works were included in the Adelaide Biennale of Australian Art. The secondary art market, meanwhile, was returning six-figure sums for her works at auction; in 2007 a record for Oliver's work was set when Skein (2004) went under the hammer for $192,000. By 2010, Sydney Biennale chairman Luca Belgiorno-Nettis was reported to have paid $300,000 for one of Oliver's sculptures, titled Tracery. In 2011, Sydney's College of Fine Arts announced that its new sculpture studio would be named after Oliver. In late 2017 Hannah Fink's book Bronwyn Oliver: Strange Things was launched by Kip Williams at Carthona. Works by Oliver are held in most major Australian art collections, including the National Gallery of Australia, the Art Gallery of New South Wales, the National Gallery of Victoria, Queensland Art Gallery, the Art Gallery of South Australia, the Auckland Art Gallery, the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery, Wollongong City Gallery, Orange Regional Gallery, and the Australian government's collection Artbank. The first \\"comprehensive survey of 50 key works, from the mid-1980s to the final solo exhibition in 2006\\" was held in Tarrawarra Museum of Art in Healesville, Victoria from 19 November 2016 to 5 February 2017.

Operational for barely over a year between May 1966 and September 1967,Demery, Leroy W. Monorails in Japan, p.25. Carquinez Associates, 2005. various attempts to restart or rebuild the line continued for 35 years, until it was finally decommissioned in 2002. History Toshiba Monorail advertisement celebrating the opening of the monorail, 1966 Opened in August 1964, Yokohama Dreamland was Japan's first large-scale, modern amusement park and an instant hit. Due to its inconvenient location far from the nearest station, plans were soon drawn up to connect it to Ofuna Station by monorail, and a mere two years later, in May 1966, the Yokohama Dreamland Monorail was opened to the public, offering an 8-minute ride from Ofuna station to the park. Despite a steep fare (at the time) of ¬•170, the line was initially a hit, and with significant population growth in the area, plans were soon made to add an intermediate infill station and extend the line to Mutsuai Station on the Odakyu Enoshima Line. However, cracks soon started appearing in the monorail beam. The developers had been unable to buy the necessary land along the original route, forcing the route of the monorail to be changed, resulting in steep grades of as much as 100‚Ä∞ (10%). The monorail vehicles were altered to cope with the high grades, increasing their weight, but the strength of the beam was not increased to match. It soon became clear that the beam was simply not strong enough to withstand these additional stresses safely, and in September 1967, the service was suspended after operating for only one year and four months. Operator Dream Transport and constructor Toshiba promptly started debating who was responsible for the whole debacle, with mediation dragging on for 14 years until a settlement was finally reached in 1981. However, the settlement did not lead to repairs, much less restarting operations, and eventually the unmaintained infrastructure started to fall apart, with the vehicles decommissioned in 1987, the electrical transmission lines in 1991 and Ofuna's monorail station in 1992. Meanwhile, Yokohama Dreamland was purchased in 1988 by Japanese retail group Daiei, who decided to rebuild the line as a HSST maglev train. Planning started in earnest in 1995, with the line to be up and running by 1999. However, protests by local residents worried about electromagnetic radiation, as well as the high costs associated with the new technology, led to this plan being scuppered in 2001. Daiei proposed a conventional small monorail instead, but the continuing fallout of the bursting of the Japanese asset bubble and Daiei's subsequent economic difficulties meant that they did not have the capital necessary to build this. Yokohama Dreamland was closed on February 17, 2002, and on August 21 of the same year, with no financial support forthcoming from the City of Yokohama, Daiei announced that they intended to abandon the line once and for all. Parked Dreamland monorail (1984) Most of the remnants of the line were demolished by early 2005. Dreamland Station is now a parking lot, while the site of the Ofuna station has been turned into an apartment block. Some segments of the track itself still remain. Impact Many of the lessons learned were applied to the Shonan Monorail, opened in 1970, which connects Ofuna to Shonan-Enoshima Station and is still operational.

She won the Award de la Mode (1997), the Whirlpool Award for best female designer (1998), Fashion Designer of the Year at British Glamour's Women of the Year Awards (2012). She was named Contemporary Designer of the Year at the Elle Style Awards in 2014. Her collaboration with H&M; in 2013 was so successful that company's website crashed under the demand and the collection was sold out within 45 minutes. Celebrities wearing Marant's designs include Alexa Chung, Katie Holmes, Victoria Beckham, Kate Moss, Sienna Miller, Kate Bosworth and Rachel Weisz.  Life  Isabel Marant was born on 12 April 1967 in Boulogne-Billancourt to a French father and German mother. Her parents divorced when Marant was six and she lived with her father who had remarried. In childhood, Marant didn't want to be a designer, dreaming of becoming a veterinarian when she grew up. She was raised in the chic Parisian suburb Neuilly-sur-Seine, refusing to wear dresses and carrying alternative outfits to school in plastic bags. At the age of 14 Marant had a haircut like Patti Smith's and wore customised menswear. In 1982, she asked her father to buy her a sewing machine and she started making clothes out of discarded clothing and fabric, and very soon, her friends asked her to design clothing for them. At 15 Marant was crazy about Vivienne Westwood and she did babysitting to be able to buy something at Westwood's Paris shop. Between 16 and 18 Marant went out with Christophe Lemaire, the creative director at Herm√®s and the designer of his own line. Together they designed clothing under the brand All√©e Simple and dropped it off to a Le Depot shop in Paris that paid when clothes were sold. The clothing sold well enough to make her reconsider her plans to study economics. From 1985 to 1987, Marant studied fashion at Studio Ber√ßot, a Paris fashion college. Marant is married to a designer J√©r√¥me Dreyfuss. Their son, Tal, was born in 2003. The family lives in Belleville, a suburb of Paris. They spend most of their weekends in a countryside cabin with no electricity and no hot water in Fontainebleau, 50 km away from Paris. Career= Early career  In 1987, after her studies, Marant worked with Parisian designer Michel Klein. Later she also collaborated with Bridget Yorke working on two collections and assisted art director Marc Ascoli on different projects for Chlo√©, Martine Sitbon, and Yohji Yamamoto. However, working in other houses was a frustrating experience for her, and soon Marant decided to go it alone. In 1989, she launched her own jewellery label, and in 1990 with her mother, she launched a knitwear label \\"Twen\\". Brand's logo  Isabel Marant  In 1994, she launched her eponymous brand ‚Äì Isabel Marant. The following year, in 1995, she showed her first collection at Paris Fashion Week with her friends as models. In 1997 Marant won the Award de la Mode, and in 1998 ‚Äì the Whirlpool Award for best female designer. Since the establishment of her label, her sales have increased 30% each year. In 1998, she opened the first shop on Rue Charonne, in eastern Paris. The same year she started collaborating with French mail catalogue brand La Redoute creating guest collections for it, and launched a new line in Japan called I*M. In 1999 Marant debuted a diffusion line, √âtoile by Isabel Marant, at the Paris ready-to-wear shows, and the next year introduced the first full √âtoile collection. Etoile was intended to be more affordable and casual than the signature brand. The second shop was opened in Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s in 1999, followed by the third in the Marais in 2007, and the fourth in the 16th arrondissement in 2012. In 2004, Marant launched a childrenswear line and a pop-up boutique in Paris' Printemps department store. She also collaborated with Anthropologie on a collection in 2006. The same year, in 2006, she opened a boutique in Hong Kong, and in 2010 opened her first United States boutique in New York. Marant's managing director reported wholesale revenues reached 66 million Euros for 2011, which was up 44% on 2010. In 2012, Marant was awarded Fashion Designer of the Year at British Glamour's Women of the Year Awards. In 2013 Isabel Marant collaborated on a design collection for high street chain H&M.; The line sold out in 45 minutes online and caused the retailer's website to crash. In her collaboration with H&M;, Marant said, \\"The nice thing with H&M; is they don't want to try to do a cheap version of your own collection‚Ä¶ They really respect the DNA of designers.\\" The clothing was described as a \\"combination of androgynous chic and bohemian nonchalance.\\" In 2014, Isabel Marant was named Contemporary Designer of the Year at the Elle Style Awards in 2014. As of the 2019 the company has 13 shops worldwide in cities such as Paris, Rome, New York, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Seoul, Los Angeles, Beijing, Madrid, Beirut and London and has retailers in more than 35 countries.  Style  When Marant studied fashion at Studio Ber√ßot, the director said ‚ÄúYou shouldn't want others to wear things that you won't wear yourself‚Äù, and this phrase became her motto. Marant collections are based around several simple pieces such as tight and straight trousers; soft and unstructured shirts and blouses; as well as tailored jackets and coats. Her apparel is often embellished with prints, fringes, embroidery, studs or lace. Marant's typical outfit allows the wearer to be between boho and rock chic with a loose blouse and a pair of cropped leather trousers. The collections never change radically which makes it easy to combine pieces from different seasons. Marant designed hidden heel high-top sneakers that lengthen legs and make feet look tiny remaining comfortable at the same time. They became the brand's most pervasive trend with a million copies sold.  Controversies  In 2008 Marant won a claim against French fashion chain Naf Naf that was ordered to pay her 75,000 Euros damages for copying a puff-sleeved dress from her autumn-winter 2006 collection. In 2015 the indigenous Mixe community of Santa Mar√≠a Tlahuitoltepec, in Oaxaca, Mexico, denounced Marant for the plagiarism of the collectively owned traditional design embroidered in their Mixe blouses. A Twitter storm followed under the hashtag #miBlusadeTlahui, which pointed out the uncanny similarity of some of Marant's recent designs to those of indigenous designers from Tlahuitoltepec, who have been designing and making their original hand-sewn shirts for over 600 years in the style of the Mixe indigenous people. Marant's uncredited appropriation of the designs, virtually stitch-for-stitch, aroused the anger of the Mixe people for whom the handmade manufacture of the shirts, and their sale, is an important economic and cultural factor. The plagiarism issue continued to dog Marant, being taken up by the UK Guardian newspaper in June 2015 by journalist Naomi Larsson, who reported that yet another design company named Antik Batik had claimed copyright on the disputed garment, and quoted Marant's office as admitting the design was from Tlahuitoltepec as a defence against the claim. The Mixe people had received no communication of this acknowledgement, according to the report. In 2016 the community again demanded an apology from Marant and Antik Batik at a press conference in Mexico City.

Petrus Petri (also Pedro P√©rez) ( 1220 ‚Äì 1291) was a thirteenth-century Spanish master architect. For centuries it was held with complete certainty that he was the first master architect of the Cathedral of Toledo, based on the only existing testimony regarding the authorship, a legend inscribed in vulgar Latin still visible on a tombstone in the churchG√≥mez Moreno, Elena (1947). Mil Joyas del Arte Espa√±ol, tomo I: Antig√ºedad y Edad Media. Barcelona: Instituto Gallach. Towards the middle of the 20th century, the bishop of Ciudad Real thoroughly investigated this claim and brought to light a series of documents which demonstrated the existence of a first master prior to Petrus Petri called Master Mart√≠n, married to Mar√≠a G√≥mez and certainly of French origin, who had been summoned by Xim√©nez de Rada. One of the documents is dated to 1227 and names \\"a master Mart√≠n of the work of Saint Mary of Toledo\\". Another document lists income collected by the cathedral in 1234 and records again the name of \\"Master Mart√≠n of the work\\", of whom it is also written that he was a tenant of a house associated with the cathedral. In later writings there appear the names of Mart√≠n (stonemason) and Juan Mart√≠n (master of stonemasons), who are believed to be relatives of each other. No new documents have appeared, so at present this master Mart√≠n is accredited as the first architect. To this argument it must be added that the date of the beginning of construction does not correlate with the age of Petrus Petri who during those years must have been too young to be an architect. The Cathedral seen from the Church of San Ildefonso Studies released after this discovery indicate that the master Mart√≠n would be the designer of the chapels of the ambulatory and upon his departure by death or by absence the supervision of the work was taken up by master Petrus who finished the ambulatories and constructed the triforia in Toledan style. Towards the end of the 20th century, the sanctuary and two sections of the naves of the south side were completed. It is known that Petrus Petri also worked on the Old Cathedral of Salamanca, discussed in the Archives of the Cathedral of that city, where he also worked with Flor√≠n de Pituenga, Casandro Romano, Alvar Garc√≠a, Pedro de la Obra, Juan el Pedrero, Sancho Pedro and Juan Franco.
