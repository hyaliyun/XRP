Liquid-based cytology is a method of preparing samples for examination in cytopathology. The sample is collected, normally by a small brush, in the same way as for a conventional smear test, but rather than the smear being transferred directly to a microscope slide, the sample is deposited into a small bottle of preservative liquid. At the laboratory, the liquid is treated to remove other elements such as mucus before a layer of cells is placed on a slide. The technique improves specimen adequacy and HSIL detection. The United Kingdom screening programmes changed their cervical screening method from the Pap test to liquid-based cytology in 2008.Liquid Based Cytology (LBC), NHS cervical screening programme (accessed 28/07/2014) History For many years, efforts have been made to develop methods that would enhance the sensitivity and specificity of the Papanicolaou smear (also called Pap smear). Emphasis has been placed on creating automated screening machines whose success depends on a representative sampling of cells on standardized slides containing a monolayer of well-stained, well-preserved cells. From this research and development, liquid-based gynecologic specimen collection has evolved. Its proponents argue that liquid-based preparations outperform conventional smears because of improved fixation, decreased obscuring factors, and standardization of cell transfer. Proponents point out that, in direct smears, the cells are not transferred in a representative fashion and that up to 90% of the material scraped from the cervix may be discarded with the sampling device. With liquid-based collection, the sampling will be representative and operator- dependent variation will not occur since processing is controlled by the laboratory. SurePath (by BD) and ThinPrep (by Hologic) are two such systems currently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for cervicovaginal testing. With both methods, the sample is collected in the conventional manner with one of the brush instruments but, instead of being spread onto a glass slide, it is transferred to a vial of transport medium. Multiple studies have shown that both systems improve specimen adequacy and HSIL detection. Methods In the SurePath method, the sample is vortexed, strained, layered onto a density gradient, and centrifuged. Instruments required are a computer-controlled robotic pipette and a centrifuge. The cells form a circle 12.5 mm in diameter. The ThinPrep method requires an instrument and special polycarbonate filters. After the instrument immerses the filter into the vial, the filter is rotated to homogenize the sample. Cells are collected on the surface of the filter when a vacuum is applied. The filter is then pressed against a slide to transfer the cells into a 20 mm diameter circle. Both methods result in a well-preserved approximate monolayer of cells with a background devoid of blood and mucus. However, the current high cost of these patented commercial systems, requiring cytotechnologists and pathologists to interpret the ThinPrep slides, has led to the development and evaluation of less costly alternatives. One such method referred to as SpinThin, developed by Khalbuss et al. (2000), uses a modified electric toothbrush to release the cells into suspension from the collecting device. The cells are spun directly onto a 10 √ó 20 mm area of a glass slide using a Cytospin II cytocentrifuge with megafunnel. Results correlated well with conventional smears and follow-up histology. Another method described by Johnson et al. (2000) places the cervical collection device into 15 ml of CytoRich Red (TriPath Imaging), a proprietary formula of buffering agents, emulsifiers, formaldehyde, and alcohol. After arrival in the laboratory, cell suspensions are vortexed, poured through tulle and centrifuged. Following centrifugation, the supernatant is discarded and the sediment is vortexed. A drop of sediment is placed into an 8 ml Hettich cytocentrifuge chamber prefilled with 2 ml of CytoRich Yellow (TriPath Imaging), a proprietary Saccomanno-like fixative that prevents dehydration and collapse of 3-dimensional structures when slides are air-dried, and then spun onto adhesive-coated slides. Advantages include batch processing and reusability of its funnel assembly, which decreases the bulk of disposable plastic that can significantly impact the environment as well as add to the cost of individual tests.

It is situated on the right bank of the Seerhein, opposite the city centre. It was named after the Petershausen Abbey.  History  Map of Constance and Peterhausen, 1807 There was a Roman settlement at this point, which was abandoned in the third century. Later. the area came into the possession of the Reichenau Abbey. A new settlement emerged after bishop Gebhard of Constance founded the imperial abbey of Petershausen. The settlement consisted of a double village: the upper village to the east of the monastery, known as the (\\"Star Quarter\\"), after the local inn (\\"to the stars\\"), and a lower village, in which the servants of the monastery lived, southwest of the monastery, along the road to Reichenau. The villages developed relatively independently, but came increasingly under the influence of the city of Constance and became a suburb of Constance around the year 1600. The development of Petershausen still remained quiet at first. The suburb lost an important engine for development when the monastery was secularized in 1802 and the monastic building subsequently began to decay. The remaining usable building of the monastery were used as a military hospital and expanded in 1850 to barracks. In 1863 Baden State Railway connected Constance to its network with a terminal station at Petershausen. This led to an upswing of Constance and Petershausen in particular. Growth of Constance to the south was limited by the Swiss border, so the increase in population primarily occurred around the former monastery at Petershausen. Promenades and new residential areas were built east of the Star Quarter, along the shore of Lake Constance, and in the north, along the road to Wollmatingen. In 1912, an elementary school was founded in Petershausen, today's Theodor-Heuss- Realschule. A new church was planned in 1913, but was delayed by World War I and the subsequent inflation and was only dedicated 17 years later. The Star Quarter was torn down in 1936 to make room for the expansion of the Old Rhine Bridge. The entire neighbourhood was demolished to make room for a multi-lane road and a railway underpass in the direction of Staad. Only the name of the traffic junction (\\"star place\\") is a reminder of the former quarter.

A head bailiff is mistaken for a wealthy banker, and the Regent and his creditors pay him extravagant courtesy. Helen loves her music teacher, Augustin, and detests Nicola, though Anna fancies him. Thanks to the curiosity of Nicola's sister Clementine, it is discovered in an old book in the archive of a monastery that Helen and Anna were switched at birth by their nurse.

Manning was picked up from Manchester Street and presumably taken to a property in Avonside and brutally killed by stabbing, strangling and assault with a metal pole. Her body was then dumped in the nearby Avon River and found the next morning by a kayaker. In March 2012, Mauha Huatahi Fawcett,http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/9996631/Life-in-jail-for- Mellory-Manning-murder a 24-year-old, unemployed man was arrested and charged with the murder and abduction of Manning. Previously, the case's severity and longevity had led police to fear of a repeat killer, and a reward on information was issued. Following the arrest police acknowledged there were more people involved than the man in custody and the investigation would be ongoing. Victim Manning had a difficult upbringing that saw her father run out on her family and a difficult step father. At the age of 14 Manning went into foster care after playing up, and began to take drugs. She subsequently had been working as a prostitute since 15. In 1999, she was sentenced to 18 months jail for stabbing a shop assistant with a blood-filled syringe during a robbery. Manning spent several stints behind bars and had a sister, Jasmine, who ran in similar circles. Manning lost contact with Jasmine in 2008 when she entered witness protection and in July, Jasmine killed herself. Manning decided to give up on prostitution and drugs, as she feared she would die young like her sister. Clean from drugs, Manning went to a polytechnic and studied art. She and her partner decided to start a family and have children. However, Manning's poverty and unemployment made her unable to afford Christmas presents for her family, and she decided to return to prostitution for \\"just one night\\". In mid 2008 the Mongrel Mob gang began to overrun central Christchurch sex workers by demanding 20 dollar tax from each job as they \\"owned the street\\". Because of this, Manning fell into bad relationships with the gang due to either not paying the forced taxes on street workers or for drug debts. Being back on the streets also caused Manning to relapse and in the days or hours before her death, she took methadone, morphine, diazepam, possibly temazepam, and THC, the active ingredient in cannabis. Homicide On 18 December 2008 Manning was walking down Blenheim Road and was picked up by a client at 9:17 pm. She was dropped off at her usual corner of Manchester and Peterborough Streets in Christchurch's central city. She was picked up again at 9:30 from this area and dropped back there. Manning then had another client which lasted until 10:20 pm. She was then picked up at 10:35 or 10:40, by Mauha Huatahi Fawcett, a 21-year-old unemployed man, who went by the gang name \\"Muck Dog\\" and was known to the street workers of Manchester Street. Fawcett had not yet received entry into the Mongrel Mob gang and had been ordered to take part in the killing of Manning for her debts to receive his patch. Fawcett coerced Manning into the car by showing her a threatening text from another gang member. Manning sent a text message at 10:43 before being driven to Galbraith Avenue in Avonside. The drive would have taken around 10 minutes. As part of earning his patch, Fawcett was ordered to stab Manning but backed out, before loud music was turned on and she was strangled, stabbed, raped and beaten with a metal pole, whilst gang members \\"barked like dogs\\" and gave Nazi salutes. Manning died from her injuries and Fawcett dropped her body at the nearby Avon river. Investigation Manning's body was discovered the next morning by a kayaker. Her watch had stopped at 11 o'clock, due to water damage. Police suggested they may have found items of interest in the river. The investigation was conducted by 30 officers, however it was constantly interrupted due to bad weather and rain. Police confirmed that more than one weapon was behind Manning's death. The police interviewed more than 900 people and learned of a dark Ford Falcon that may have been involved. They also obtained Manning's client list, receiving a list of 40 people they were eager to speak to. The police took DNA evidence from a carpark where Manning was known to take her clients. There were numerous people of interest, namely men who lived in Christchurch and regularly used prostitutes. The police dismissed the theory that the murder had been a robbery gone wrong as her handbag with all her belongings was still over her shoulder when she was discovered. After security footage was examined at the time of Manning's disappearance, it was declared that police were looking for an Indian man who may have been a client of Manning's and a driver of a blue 4 wheel drive. After talking to another prostitute about the murder, police interviewed a man and vital information was recorded. Seeds were found on the cardigan Manning was wearing, suggesting numerous places at which the murder could have taken place. In October 2009 a man who had lived with Manning was approached by police to identify a voice that he recognised as highup in the \\"criminal underworld\\". Other persons of interest included a man in a singlet with brown curly hair, two men standing by a 4WD and the driver of a white saloon vehicle all located within metres of the location Manning's body was found on the night of her death. In December 2010 it was announced that the location where Manning was murdered had been identified due to the seeds found on her body; it was close to where the body had been dumped in a property on Galbraith Avenue in Avonside. A warehouse at the site was a Mongrel Mob hangout at the time and they were known to work prostitutes; however it was not ruled out that the property could have been accessed by others as well. In September 2011 it was announced police had discovered semen on Manning's body that was not matched to any of her partners that night. Despite the fact she was possibly sexually assaulted, the police did not rule out the possibility Manning had an unknown sexual partner or client. It was announced they were focusing the investigation on gang members as a result of the discovery of her death site. =Arrest= On 29 March 2012, police arrested and charged 24-year-old, unemployed, Mauha Huatahi Fawcett with the murder and kidnap of Manning. The man was not associated with the semen sample found at the scene but was living in Christchurch at the time and was definitely associated with the crime scene. The man was a suspect early in the investigation but police went on to state; \\"From evidence gathered it is clear that a number of people have been involved in either the kidnapping or murder of Ms Manning. The inquiry is continuing to identify all persons who were responsible for her death, or were accessories after the fact, so that they can be brought to justice.\\" The family of Manning was pleased, with her brother stating; \\"It's great news. I definitely wasn't expecting it. I thought it might take a bit longer. It's been well over three years (of waiting).\\" Trial Fawcett's trial began in the High Court in February 2014 and was expected to last 6 weeks. Fawcett carried out his own defense and claimed police had coerced him into making a confession. In March 2014, a jury of 6 men and 6 women found Fawcett guilty of murdering Manning. In May, Fawcett was sentenced life imprisonment with possibility of parole after 20 years. Police acknowledged that Fawcett's sentencing was not the end of the investigation as other gang members were involved in Manning's death. A person of interest labelled \\"Male B\\" has not yet been identified but is likely connected to Fawcett and the murder. =Appeal and retrial= On 7 August 2017, the Court of Appeal set aside Fawcett's conviction and ordered a retrial. The reasons for the appeal were not publicly disclosed to preserve the right to a fair trial. Aftermath Due to the high profile of the case, several other murder cases were instantly linked. However no links have been subsequently established. These included the murder of Vanessa Pickering (who knew Manning personally) and the murder of Tisha Lowry.

Thabit has been living in Libya where any form of dissent was banned by law in Muammar Gaddafi's regime and could have resulted in his being arrested and imprisoned, the primary reason for his using an epithet to preserve his anonymity. Ibn Thabit's music is considered to have given a voice to Libyans who wish to express themselves politically and non-violently despite being disenfranchised. Dissenting cultural figures have been arrested and tortured in a number of countries during the Arab Spring. Ibn Thabit considers himself to be an ordinary Libyan who is \\"speaking the thoughts of many Libyan youth\\". He claims that he is inspired by the people, telling a journalist from the Danish newspaper Information that he was more affected by conversations with fellow Libyans than by anything else. Not much is known about him other than that he is young, male and Libyan. He is thought to be from Tarhunah. Ibn Thabit was one of the early critics of Gaddafi in 2011, the nascent movement building up to a full-fledged civil war, part of the Arab Spring. Popular music of kind produced by Ibn Thabit represents the cultural face of the 2011 Libyan civil war. One of his works praises the city of Benghazi. Ibn Thabit has his own website with support from people abroad on which many of his own songs and others produced in collaboration are freely available for download. On his website, Ibn Thabit claims that to have been \\"attacking Gaddafi\\" with music since 2008, when he posted his first song, \\"Moammar - the coward\\", on the internet. Lyrics of a song \\"Al-Soo'al\\" released by Ibn Thabit on YouTube on 27 January 2011, weeks before the riots began in Libya are indicative of the rebel sentiment. Ibn Thabit's music is featured in a compilation of Arabic Spring resistance rap songs by Khala labelled Khala's Mixtape Volume 1. Ibn Thabit has also podcast about reconciliation, an important though controversial subject on the Free Libya Podcast. Ibn Thabit uses the internet and social media such as Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, webcasting, podcasting and other means to spread his music and message.

He joined the army in the Iberian Peninsula early in 1809, and remained with it until the summer of 1812, when he was sent to England for recovery from the effects of a very severe wound received while leading on one of the columns to the assault of Badajoz in April 1812. He returned to the army in October of the following year at his own request, and remained with it to the close of the war. During his service in Peninsular War he was constantly before the enemy. First, in Abrantes and skirmishes near it, while the French were in front of the lines of Lisbon; secondly, at both the sieges of Badajoz in 1811, at the cavalry affair of El Boden, and in the trenches before Ciudad Rodrigo; and thirdly, at the siege of Badajoz in 1812, when he led on the Portuguese column of the 4th division to the assault of the breach of the curtain, and was severely wounded. He was shortly after sent to England for the restoration of his health. Prior to the siege he was occupied in improving the navigation of the Upper Douro to facilitate the transfer of supplies for the operations in Badajoz. On rejoining the army as a captain in 1813 he was employed in the examination of the fords of the Nive, held by the enemy's posts prior to the successful passage of that river. During the following campaign he was attached to the 2nd division, and was present at the battle of St. Pierre, near Bayonne, at the attack on the heights of Garres St.-Palais at Tarbes, and at the battles of Orthez and Toulouse.

As an artist, Bartlett‚Äôs iconic style has been featured in publications, solo and collaborative public artworks, and moving object performances including panoramic ‚Äúcrankie shows‚Äù and large-scale papier-mache puppetry. Stuntology is Bartlett‚Äôs signature art and performance genre of humorous parlor tricks and messy exploration of fun with everyday objects. Decades of collection and documentation are represented in four illustrated volumes of Stuntology cartoons, as well as his long-running one- man show. As a musician, Bartlett has had longtime prominence as a performer and composer in the national contra dance music circuit. Early life Bartlett is the youngest of four children born to Richmond Jay Bartlett and Martha Harry Bartlett. He attended Shelburne Village School and the Shelburne Middle School in Shelburne, Vermont. He received the Daughters of the American Revolution Good Citizenship Award in 8th grade. At Champlain Valley Union High School in Hinesburg, Vermont, he was voted class clown and was known for his banjo playing, drawing and tennis skills. After graduating in three and a half years, Bartlett attended the University of Vermont and studied geography (1984). Musical career Bartlett performed with The Green Mountain Volunteers on the banjo and as an Appalachian clogger in 1984. He played contra dances around Vermont and New England starting in 1985, supplementing his income by making apple cider for the Chittenden Cider Mill from 1985 to 1988. After moving to Boston he became ensconced in the urban contra dance scene. During this time he played mandolin and tenor banjo with three highly influential touring bands: Uncle Gizmo, Wild Asparagus, and the Clayfoot Strutters, and assisted in reshaping the face of modern contra dance music. Bartlett met his future wife, Abby Ladin, in 1992 and moved to Bloomington, Indiana, to be with her. Ladin's percussive dance group, Rhythm In Shoes (RIS), absorbed Bartlett and he toured with RIS for the next 10 years. Bartlett resumed playing the national contra dance circuit in 1997 after forming the Reckless Ramblers (with Larry Unger, Nat Hewitt, Ginny Snowe, and later Mark Hellenberg) and also being an original member of the Sevens (with Mark Roberts, Sarah Blair, Stuart Kenney, and Mark Hellenberg). In 2005, Bartlett began playing with Notorious (Eden MacAdam-Somer, Larry Unger, and Mark Hellenberg) and continues to play with them to this day. Since 2014, Bartlett has also been a member of the 5-piece Stringrays, with Rodney Miller, Max Newman, Mark Hellenberg, and Stuart Kenney. In addition to being a contra dance musician, Bartlett has maintained a dual identity as an old-time musician. He helped found the Monks shortly thereafter (with Frank Hall, Claudio Buchwald, and Abby Ladin.) The Monks released two critically acclaimed recordings, distributed widely by County Records: Let Us Play (1998), and Ragged But Righteous (2002). In 1999, Bartlett began playing with Illinois native fiddler Garry Harrison, and he was an integral member of the group that made the now legendary recording of original old-time music, Red Prairie Dawn (2000). Though a proud practitioner and teacher of various traditional music styles, Bartlett has made his own recording career as a musical iconoclast, choosing to blend musical styles rather than adhere to any notion of genre purity. This started with Sam and Sue Belting You with Reels (1993, re- released in 2006) with Bartlett playing swing guitar with traditional Irish fiddler, Sue Sternberg. Bartlett traveled to southwest Louisiana in 1996 and teamed up with Dirk Powell to make Swamp Ceili, the first radical mixing of Irish and Cajun and Zydeco music. Swamp Ceili featured the slide guitarist Sonny Landreth. In 2004, Bartlett followed Swamp Ceili with a recording of all original music, Evil Diane. This was the first contra dance repertoire CD to be reviewed on NPR‚Äôs All Things Considered. In 2016, Bartlett released a sequel to Evil Diane, Dance-a-rama. Cartoonist and community artist Concurrent with a long and active music performing career, Bartlett has maintained another identity as a documentarian and drawer of tricks and stunts. The Journal of Stuntology was Bartlett's self-published zine from 1992 to 2006. A selection of cartoons from the zine was edited into the book Stuntology (2002) and followed in 2007 by The Big Book of Stuntology. Workman publishing bought the rights to these two books in 2007 and put out The Best of Stuntology (2008). Bartlett has also self-published 51 Impossible Stunts Anyone Can Do. Bartlett has been a featured character/performer on the Indiana PBS show, The Friday Zone, since 2012. The steady rotation of 45 different segments of his stunts has made him recognizable to children throughout the state. As an offshoot of illustrating a series of books, Bartlett has been hired by the city of Bloomington, Indiana, to do public artwork, notably featuring traffic boxes and two murals. The mural for the Building and Trades Park measures 240 feet long and celebrates the trades that built the city of Bloomington. Bartlett has designed a street mural for Bloomington Open Streets, and received Indiana State Arts in the Parks Grants a collaborative moving panorama. Bartlett has been hired by communities across the country to do local, participatory art projects. His specialty has been to make participatory ‚ÄúCranky Shows,‚Äù hand-cranked, moving panorama drawings that tell stories that happened in a certain locale. He has been a touring artist in Alaska and an artist in residence with the Juneau Arts and Humanities Council. He received a grant from the State of Indiana to write a moving panorama history of its oldest State Park, McCormick's Creek State Park. He was hired by the Lotus World Music Festival to make giant paper mache parade masks and a participatory cranky show about the life of Lotus Dickey. Personal life He lives with his wife, Abby Ladin, and three kids in Bloomington, Indiana.

During the Napoleonic Wars he saw active service in Walcheren, Sicily, and at Waterloo, before commanding regiments and divisions in the Crimean War and in India. Early life and family England was the son of Lieutenant General Richard England of Lifford, County Clare, a veteran of the War of American Independence, colonel of the 5th Regiment, lieutenant-governor of Plymouth, and one of the first colonists of Western Upper Canada, by Anne, daughter of James O'Brien of Ennistyen, a cadet of the family of the Marquess of Thomond. He was born at Fort Detroit, then part of Upper Canada, in 1793, and after being educated at Winchester College and the Royal Military College, Great Marlow,Charles Edward Buckland, Dictionary of Indian Biography (1906), p. 139 entered the army as an ensign in the 14th Regiment on 25 February 1808. Career England was promoted to lieutenant on 1 June 1809, and served in that year in the expedition to the Walcheren and in the attack on Flushing. He was employed in the adjutant-general's department in Sicily in 1810 and 1811, and served in the defence of Tarifa as a volunteer on his way to take up his appointment. He was promoted captain into the 60th Regiment on 11 July 1811, and exchanged into the 12th on 1 January 1812. In that year he went on leave to Canada to join his father, after whose death he returned to England, married Anna Maria, sister of Sir J. C. Anderson, in 1814, and in 1815 joined his regiment at Paris after the Battle of Waterloo. He remained in France until the withdrawal of the army of occupation in 1818, and after serving as aide-de-camp to Major General Sir Colquhoun Grant, commanding at Dublin from 1821 to 1823, he was promoted major into the 75th Regiment of Foot on 4 September 1823, and on 29 October 1825 took command of the regiment with the rank of lieutenant colonel, in the place of the Duke of Cleveland. He kept this commanded for many years and led the regiment to the Cape in 1833. On the outbreak of the Kaffir War in 1836, Lieutenant General Sir Galbraith Cole, who was then in command at the Cape, chose Colonel England to command the eastern frontier with the temporary rank of brigadier general, and he served throughout the campaigns of 1836 and 1837 in this rank. For his services he received a medal, and on 28 June 1838 was promoted full colonel. In 1839 England was transferred to the command of the 41st (Welch) Regiment of Foot and appointed to command the Belgaum district of the Bombay Presidency with the rank of brigadier general. Immediately on his arrival he lost his wife. From this place he was summoned in 1841 to take command of the Bombay Army division despatched to the relief of Colonel Palmer at Ghuznee and General William Nott at Kandahar. He failed to reach Ghuznee in time, but, after one repulse, forced his way through the Pish√≠n valley, and reached Kandahar in time to join Nott, and as second in command to that general assisted in the defeat of Akbar Khan on the Khojak Heights. He remained at Kandahar till the close of 1842, when it was decided to abandon that place, and he was then placed in command of the force which retired through the Bolan Pass into Sind, while Nott marched with seven thousand picked troops on Ghuznee and Cabul. It cannot be said that England had greatly distinguished himself during these operations. Nott complained greatly of him, and though he did what he was appointed to do, and had relieved Kandahar, his operations were not considered as successful as they might have been, and he had suffered reverses, which were very like defeats, from the Bal√∫ch√≠s both during his advance and his retreat. Nevertheless, he was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 27 September 1843, and then threw up his command, returned home, and settled at Bath. England remained unemployed until 1849, when he received the command of the Curragh brigade, and he was promoted major general on 11 November 1851. In 1854 the censure passed on his behaviour in Afghanistan seemed to be forgotten, and he was placed in command of the 3rd Division in the Crimean expedition. At the battle of the Alma his division was not so severely engaged as the guards or the light division; but at Inkerman England was one of the generals first upon the scene of action, and though he was never in actual command there, his promptitude in sending up his troops at the critical moment to the assistance of the hard-pressed battalions on the Inkerman Tusk greatly contributed to the success of the day. It was during the trying winter of 1854‚Äì55 that England chiefly distinguished himself. He suffered the greatest privations with his troops, but yet he never applied to come home and was the last of the original general officers who had accompanied the army to the Crimea to leave it. Before he did return, he directed the attack on the Redan on 18 June 1855, and it was not his fault that the result of that day's hard fighting was not a great success. In August 1855 he was, however, obliged to obey the doctor's orders and return to England. For his services he was promoted lieutenant general, and appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath, a grand officer of the Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour, and a knight of the first class of the Order of the Medjidie. England never again saw active service. He was made colonel of the 50th (Queen's Own) Regiment in 1854 and transferred as colonel to the 41st Regiment of Foot on 20 April 1861. he was promoted full general on 6 July 1863, and placed on the retired list in 1877.

In 1813, seventy-five students subscribed to give the great silver cup with cover to Abernethy which is now used as a loving-cup at the annual dinner of the teachers of the medical school of St. Bartholomew's, and Eyre was chosen to present the piece of plate. In 1814 he became a member of the College of Surgeons, and began practice in Hereford, where he attained some local celebrity; in 1830 Eyre was elected mayor (or in 1929), and was knighted in that year on the accession of William IV. George Drinkwater, mayor of Liverpool, was the only other mayor knighted, and a remark of Abernethy to a patient on these honours preserves the correct pronunciation of Eyre's name. \\"Go away,\\" said Abernethy, \\"and have always in your thoughts the names of the mayors who have just been knighted, Eyre and Drinkwater, and you will soon recover your wind, and your shape too, I promise you.\\" Soon after his being knighted, Eyre decided to become a physician.

Or they might do the opposite, agreeing that clients handle their lawsuits up until the trial phase, at which point the attorney takes over. Evolution  The phrase ‚Äúunbundled legal services‚Äù has been attributed to UCLA law professor Forrest S. Mosten.Forrest S. Mosten In 2000, ‚ÄúWoody‚Äù Mosten wrote ‚ÄúUnbundling Legal Services: A Guide to Delivering Legal Services a la Carte,‚Äù which was published by the American Bar Association.Unbundling Legal Services  A Guide to Delivering Legal Services a la Carte  Forrest S. Mosten Mosten, a California attorney, specializes in family law and divorce mediation. Throughout his career he has emphasized the importance of access to justice, which likely contributed to his involvement in promoting unbundled legal services. Mosten has received the Lifetime Achievement Award for Innovations in Legal Access from the ABA Section of Delivery of Legal Services, and the Lawyer as Problem Solver Award from the ABA Section on Dispute Resolution.Mediation Expert  High Conflict Mediations  Beverly Hills Mediator  Forrest S. Mosten In 2017, Mosten's \\"Unbundled Legal Services: A Family Lawyer's Guide\\" (co-written with Elizabeth Potter Scully), reflecting years of changes and development in the unbundling field, was also published by the American Bar Association. He was also recently a guest on the Unbundled Attorney Mastermind Podcast discussing the history and future of unbundled legal services. Divorce is an area of law that can lend itself to unbundling particularly well, and the development of unbundled legal services has grown largely out of the family law field. Another California family law attorney, M. Sue Talia, helped popularize unbundled legal services.Faculty Profile - M. Sue Talia Building upon Mosten‚Äôs work, Talia wrote several publications designed to help clients get the most out of unbundling. Largely because of the advocacy by Mosten and Talia, among others, for the adoption of unbundled legal services by mainstream lawyers, which also emphasized new ethical guidelines for unbundling while maintaining the established rules, the California State Bar formally recognized unbundled legal services as a legitimate and important practice. Other states soon followed California‚Äôs lead in officially permitting unbundled legal services. With its growing acceptance in the legal profession, unbundled legal services began to evolve into other areas of law. Unbundled attorneys also began combining this new representation technique with emerging technologies such as teleconferencing and cloud computing. One of the early adopters of e-lawyering has been North Carolina lawyer Stephanie Kimbro, who implemented a ‚Äúvirtual law office‚Äù in 2006 when she focused her practice on estate planning and business law. Kimbro has since expanded her practice but continues to deliver her services solely by virtual office. She received an ABA Award for Excellence in eLawyering in 2009. One of the last areas of unbundled legal services to be embraced by state bar associations has been legal ghostwriting. Legal ghostwriting usually entails an attorney drafting a legal document ‚Äì such as a summons and complaint, an answer or an appellate brief ‚Äì on behalf of a client. The client maintains responsibility for the other aspects of the lawsuit, such as filing, corresponding with the court and opposing counsel and generally prosecuting their case. Under this agreement, the attorney ghostwriter is not the attorney of record. Instead, the client appears in the action pro se, meaning they represent themselves. The unbundled attorney might in this case inform the court of their assistance drafting the document. In 2007 the ABA relaxed its professional ethical rules to expressly permit unbundled legal services and legal ghostwriting in Rule 1.2(c).PDF In April 2010, the New York County Law Association echoed the ABA opinion by formally giving its blessing to the practice of legal ghostwriting as consistent with the state bar‚Äôs ethical rules. The NYCLA Ethics Committee on Professional Ethics in its Opinion 742 stated that ‚Äú‚Ä¶it is now ethically permissible for an attorney, with the informed consent of his or her client, to play a limited role and prepare pleadings and other submissions for a pro se litigant without disclosing the lawyer‚Äôs participation to the tribunal and adverse counsel. Disclosure of the fact that a pleading or submission was prepared by counsel need only be made ‚Äòwhere necessary.‚Äù Certain jurisdictions have called for the implementation of clinics in law schools to teach unbundling legal services to students in a practical setting, and to encourage future lawyers to use the practice. Criticisms Opponents of unbundled legal services often cite ethical concerns about the professional responsibility of a lawyer for his or her client. For one, an attorney owes the court a \\"duty of candor\\" in his or her dealings with the court. By working on a lawsuit on behalf of a client but failing to appear, some courts have held this duty is violated.Duran v. Carris, 238 F.3d 1268, 1271-73 (10th Cir. 2001) Moreover, full-service attorneys handle all aspects of a case and can be liable for legal malpractice should they be negligent in their representation of clients. Critics claim that, should an attorney limit the scope of his or her representation of a client, they might escape a malpractice claim despite having committed malpractice.Ellis v. Maine, 448 F.2d 1325 (1st Cir. 1971) Some fear that a lack of communication between lawyer and client can lead to confusion about who is responsible for what, and that important issues of a client's case can fall through the cracks. State bar associations and courts have split on the ethics of unbundling when it comes to legal ghostwriting. Some jurisdictions have ruled that ghostwriting by attorneys is prohibited, claiming that failing to disclose their assistance to a self-represented client would be misleading to the court and their adversary in the lawsuits. Others oppose legal ghostwriting because they believe it would allow an attorney to evade responsibility for a frivolous lawsuit filed by their client. Certain critics have argued that legal ghostwriting actually gives the self-represented litigant an unfair advantage over his or her adversary, even when that adversary has an attorney. The reason for this is that judges have had a history of giving pro se litigants more leeway in the courtroom to make up for their lack of experience. For example, a person appearing pro se might be allowed to fix a procedural error but had a lawyer had made the same mistake, their error would have led to some adverse consequence.Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520 (1972)ABA Model Code of Judicial Conduct, Rule 2.2, Comment [4] (adopted February 2007) (‚ÄúIt is not a violation of this Rule [requiring impartiality and fairness] for a judge to make reasonable accommodations to ensure pro se litigants the opportunity to have their matters fairly heard.‚Äù) When a self-represented litigant uses an attorney as a ghostwriter, critics argue he or she should not be entitled to any special treatment. However, proponents of legal ghostwriting point out that while judges might grant certain flexibility to pro se clients on procedural matters, no judge would rule in favor of a party simply because they lacked an attorney. To avoid the potential for this unfair advantage, some jurisdictions, like New York, require an attorney to disclose in papers submitted to the court that they were prepared by an attorney, but attorneys are not required to disclose their name or firm. Many jurisdictions look at the intent of the attorney for his legal ghostwriting. Where an attorney used the ghostwriting technique to avoid disclosing that he was not admitted in the state where the case was filed, it may be ruled unethical.Warner v. Reiter, 2010 WL 3987434 (N.D. Cal.) However the American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct have been amended to allow for legal ghostwriting where the attorney merely intends to offer unbundled legal services to a client. Another ethical concern concerning unbundled legal services is that it leads to the commoditization of law. Rather than treating the law as a profession, critics believe unbundling might lead to a factory-like approach, where cases are treated with a \\"one-size- fits-all\\" approach. However, Richard Susskind in his 2008 book \\"The End of Lawyers: Rethinking the Nature of Legal Services,\\" argues that, as technology progresses, lawyers might have no choice but to move toward commoditization. With the emergence of do-it-yourself companies that sell blank legal documents like LegalZoom, lawyers must compete with new low-cost options. Further driving down attorney fees has been outsourcing, where attorneys educated in American law but not necessarily licensed in any state provide services to law firms at reduced rates.

Mr. Eyre relocated Lingard and his students to Pontop Hall. In October 1794, the school moved to Crook Hall, where Eyre became president of the new college. The Rev. John Daniel, president of Douay College, arrived at Crook Hall in the following year, and by virtue of his office assumed the charge of the students. Though he was willing to resign this post in favour of Mr. Daniel, president of Douai, this suggested arrangement came to nothing and Mr. Eyre remained president. A few days afterwards, Daniel resigned. The institution flourished under Eyre's management. In 1803 an estate called Ushaw was bought by Bishop William Gibson, and here, early in 1804, the new college was begun, and in July, 1808, Mr. Eyre began to remove his community thither.

Donohue III Curriculum Vitae He received his BA from Hamilton College in 1974, his JD from Harvard in 1977, and his Ph.D. in economics from Yale in 1986.John J. Donohue III , Stanford University Profile. In 1982, during his first year in graduate school at Yale, Donohue unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination for the Connecticut State Senate in the 14th District (Milford, Orange, West Haven). He was a law professor at Stanford University from 1995 to 2004, then was a Professor of Law at Yale Law School from 2004 to 2010. Donohue rejoined the Stanford Law School faculty in 2010. Donohue was president of the American Law and Economics Association for 2012Past Presidents of the American Law and Economics Association and was co-editor of the American Law and Economics Review from May 2006 through August 2012. =Research and writings= Donohue is well known for using empirical analysis to determine the impact of law and public policy in a wide range of areas. Donohue teamed with the Nobel Prize Winning Economist James Heckman to author a major study evaluating the contribution of federal antidiscrimination efforts in improving the economic status of blacks in the 1960s.John Donohue III and James Heckman (1993), \\"Continuous Versus Episodic Change: The Impact of Civil Rights Policy on the Economic Status of Blacks\\", Journal of Economic Literature 29: 1603. He also coauthored an article with Peter Siegelman that explored ways to reduce crime that were less socially costly than further increases in incarceration.John J. Donohue III and Peter Siegelman (1998), \\"Allocating Resources Among Prisons and Social Programs in the Battle Against Crime\\", Journal of Legal Studies 27: 1-43. He and University of Chicago economist Steven Levitt wrote a series of articles examining the extent to which the legalization of abortion in the 1970s‚Äîwhich substantially reduced the number of unwanted births‚Äîled to reductions in crime in the 1990s.John J. Donohue III and Steven D. Levitt (2004), \\"Further Evidence that Legalized Abortion Lowered Crime\\", Journal of Human Resources 39: 29-49 (Winter 2004). According to Foote & Goetz (2008), their 2001 paper contained major mistakes in how they estimated their results and that once these errors were corrected there was no longer any relationship between abortion and crime.\\"Oops-onomics,\\" The Economist (Dec 1st 2005) http://www.economist.com/node/5246700/print?story_id=5246700. Donohue & Levitt responded to Foote & Goetz's critique in the same issue of the Quarterly Journal of Economics in which it appeared. They stated, \\"Correcting our mistake does not alter the sign or statistical significance of our estimates, although it does reduce their magnitude.\\" They also presented additional evidence they claimed supported a negative effect of legalized abortion on crime. This work was popularized by the book Freakonomics. He has also written a number of articles, many with Yale Law Professor Ian Ayres, exploring the impact on crime of laws allowing citizens to carry concealed handguns.Ayres, Ian and John J.

Compound subjects cause many difficulties in the proper usage of grammatical agreement between the subject and other entities (verbs, pronouns, etc.). In reality, these issues are not specific to compound subjects as such, coming up equally as well with compound noun phrases of all sorts, but the problems are most acute with compound subjects because of the large number of types of agreement occurring with such subjects. As shown in the examples, for English compound subjects joined by and, the agreement rules are generally unambiguous, but sometimes tricky. For example, the compound subject you and I is treated equivalently to we, taking appropriate pronominal agreement (\\"our car\\", not \\"your car\\", \\"their car\\", etc.). In languages with more extensive subject-verb agreement (e.g. Spanish or Arabic), the verb agreement is clearly revealed as also being first-person plural. Compound subjects joined by ‚Äúand‚Äù generally take a plural verb. However, there are exceptions. When compound subjects are thought of as a single unit, a singular verb is used e.g. ‚ÄúPeanut butter and jelly is available in the cafeteria.‚Äù For the subjects joined by or, however, the rules are often ill-defined, especially when two elements that differ in grammatical gender or grammatical number are coordinate. (The tendency, in such cases, is to rewrite the sentences to avoid the conjunction: e.g. \\"Sylvia and I each have our own car, and one of us is planning to sell their car\\". Note that this still has a compound subject using and as the conjunction, and uses \\"semi-informal\\" \\"generic their\\" to get around the \\"his or her\\" problem. This could be avoided with a further rewrite: \\"Either Sylvia will sell her car, or I will sell mine.\\" General concerns Additional concerns appear in compound subjects in languages other than English. In many European languages, for example, a standard problem occurs with mixed-gender compound subjects. This problem does not appear in English, because they is genderless. But e.g. French has masculine ils vs. feminine elles; Spanish similarly has masculine ellos vs. feminine ellas. In addition, Arabic has gender as well as person and number agreement on its verbs, and more specifically in its literary language and in the more conservative spoken varieties, there is gender agreement with third- person plural subjects. In addition, some languages allow subjects to follow verbs: either optionally for stylistic reasons, as in German, Latin or occasionally in English (\\"Now are entering John, Jim, and their wives\\"); as the normal state of affairs, as in Classical Arabic and Irish, where subjects precede the verb only for stylistic reasons; or even as a mandatory requirement, in languages with V-S-O or V-O-S word order and a strongly fixed word order. These languages often use different strategies for handling subjects after vs. before the verb: for example, tending to prefer an \\"agree with the closest phrase\\" strategy with a following subject, for pragmatic reasons, even when an \\"agree with the whole\\" strategy is used in other circumstances. Multiple strategies have been used to handle both compound subjects in general and category disagreement between/among the coordinate members of the subject. Languages often differ in which strategies they use. Among the strategies are: *General agreement: Consider the total set of entities involved, work out their properties, and assign a pronoun accordingly. (E.g. if the set of entities includes two women referred to in the third person, and the language has grammatical dual, as in Arabic, then the group's properties would be \\"dual number, female, third person\\", with corresponding pronoun humatƒÅ.) *Closest agreement: Simply agree with the constituent noun phrase that is closest to the verb, and ignore the rest. This generally applies only to subject-verb agreement; pronominal agreement is by its nature long-distance, and so the concept of \\"closest\\" makes less sense in this case. *If using \\"general agreement\\" and there is a disagreement among properties (e.g. some male, some female), either: Choose one (the traditional rule for most languages has been to treat mixed groups as male; some modern rules, on the other hand, call for randomly choosing one sex or the other, alternating choosing male and female in successive similar circumstances, or even for simply choosing the female gender in all cases). Use a construction (e.g. \\"he or she\\", \\"his or her\\", \\"our(s)\\") that captures both or all values of the disagreeing property. Often this is considered awkward and to be avoided. Additional concerns in English An additional concern in English is that there are special rules for pronouns in compound subjects. Although English has morphological case distinctions in pronouns (e.g. I vs. me), grammatical case is not a living characteristic of the spoken language, and hence the case-based terms subjective case (e.g. for I) vs. objective case (e.g. for me) are misleading. In general, in the spoken language, me is the default form, but I for an argument of a verb when occurring directly before a finite verb. On the other hand, in compound subjects in informal speech, me occurs in this position, e.g. Johnny and me are coming tomorrow (possibly because of the lack of direct agreement between me and are). Children are often taught in school as a matter of politeness that they should always order oneself after any others in a compound subject and use I, saying Johnny and I instead of me and Johnny and in a compound object use Johnny and me instead of me and Johnny. Although intended specifically for compound subjects, when adopted by speakers it typically is generalized to compound objects, leading to alternations such as between me and you vs. between you and I.

The Act was used as the vehicle for changes to transport organisational arrangements and transport regulation activities pursued by Victorian governments over that period. The Transport Act received the royal assent on 23 June 1983 and commenced on 1 July of that year.See endnotes, Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983. The Act remained as Victoria's principal transport statute until mid-2010 when that position was taken by a new statute, the Transport Integration Act 2010. It was renamed as the Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983, a title which it retains to this day.  Initial purpose  = Organisational reforms = The Transport Act was initially passed by the Victorian Parliament as a major reform measure particularly in relation to institutional arrangements in the transport portfolio. The Act abolished a range of long established transport agencies including the Victorian Railways, the Melbourne and Metropolitan Tramways Board and the Country Roads Board.Transport Act, Part II. In their place a range of new organisations including the State Transport Authority, the Metropolitan Transit Authority, the Road Construction Authority and the Road Traffic Authority were established.Transport Act 1983, Part II. The Transport Act also established the Ministry of Transport as the prime coordinating agency for transport in Victoria. = Transport regulation = The Transport Act also consolidated much of the suite of Victorian land transport statutes containing regulatory controls. The Act initially contained a suite of provisions affecting trains and trams, buses, taxis and hire cars and tow trucks. Few of these provisions remain today in the Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act. The main schemes which remain relate to taxi and hire car regulation, the only substantial area of Victorian transport regulation not to be contained in a discrete statute, and provisions relating to compliance and enforcement in safety areas and affecting public transport ticketing and conduct.  Later developments  The major organisational changes brought about by the Transport Act were themselves the subject of major changes in the period after 1983. = 1989 organisational consolidation = In 1989, the Victorian Parliament passed a new statute, the Transport (Amendment) Act, which made major adjustments to the initial organisational changes made by the Transport Act in 1983. The new Act merged the State Transport Authority and the Metropolitan Transit Authority to establish a new organisation, the Public Transport Corporation, to manage train, tram and bus operations in metropolitan and regional areas of Victoria. The Transport (Amendment) Act also merged the Road Construction Authority and the Road Traffic Authority to create the Roads Corporation or VicRoads to manage the State's road network and its vehicle licensing and registration systems. The mergers took effect on 1 July 1989. = Other organisational changes = Other major organisational changes occurred after 1989 including the establishment of the office of the Director of Public Transport and the abolition of the Public Transport Corporation as well as the creation of discrete and special purpose organisations such as VicTrack and V/Line. = Regulatory developments = Many of the regulatory consolidations effected by the Transport Act have been reversed since the Act was initially passed. In many cases, the Victorian Parliament has acted to pass new principal statutes for subject matters previously regulated by the Transport Act, for example: * Public Transport Competition Act 1995 (since renamed the Bus Services Act 1995) * Rail Corporations Act 1996 * Rail Safety Act 2006 * Accident Towing Services Act 2007 * Bus Safety Act 2009, and * Tourist and Heritage Railways Act 2010.  The Transport Integration Act 2010  The Victorian Parliament passed a major new transport statute, the Transport Integration Act, in early 2010 and it commenced on 1 July of that year. The new Act took over from the Transport Act as Victoria's main transport statute and, at the same time, it stretched beyond land transport settings to cover ports and marine activities.Transport Integration Act 2010 - see Parts 3, 5 and 6. = Transfer of organisations = All Victorian transport organisations created by statute have been transferred to the Transport Integration Act including the land transport agencies previously established and empowered by the Transport Act. = Change of name of Transport Act = The Transport Integration Act changed the name of the Transport Act 1983 to the Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983.Transport Integration Act, section 199(1).

Kenya's other transport corridor is the Mombasa - Uganda transport corridor that passes through Nairobi and much of the Northern Rift. Some basic LAPSSET infrastructure has been built (a police station and harbor office in Lamu and lengthening of the Lamu airport runway). The construction of LAPSSET's main components (ports, pipelines, roads, railways) is currently ongoing with construction of the first berth at Lamu Port completed in October, 2019 (situation as per October 2019).See: , businessdailyafrica.com, Tuesday, August 6, 2019 11:23. Although the project is not formally stalled, its short to medium term success looks increasingly unlikely. Insecurity and political instability in Kenya are mostly to blame for this, as are more commercially viable alternative pipeline options through Tanzania or Ethiopia. The low oil prices since 2015 also affect LAPSSET's commercial prospects.See: East Africa‚Äôs pipeline politics in 2016, Global Risk Insights, 15 January 2016. Background The project will involve the following components: * A port at Manda Bay, Lamu * Standard gauge () railway line to Juba and Addis Ababa, the South Sudanese and Ethiopian capitals respectively. * Road network * Oil pipelines (South Sudan and Ethiopia) * Oil refinery at Bargoni * Three airports * Three resort cities (Lamu, Isiolo and Lake Turkana shores) The project was initially conceived in 1975 but never took off due to various reasons. The project was later revived and included in Kenya Vision 2030. In 2009, the cost of LAPSSET was estimated as $16 billion. Recent estimates arrived after studies now put the cost of the project at between US$22 billion and US$23 billion. On 1 April 2013, Kenya's government announced the setting up of a government agency, the LAPSSET Corridor Development Authority to manage the project on behalf of the Kenyan government. The cost of the project was also put at KSh. 2.5 trillion ($29.24 billion). The timeline of the project is not clear, including when it started and when it should be finished. Some projects like the Isiolo-Merille projects began in 2007. At the peak of the project, between 2013 and 2018, it is expected that the Kenyan government will be spending about 6% of the country's Gross Domestic Product or 16% of its annual budget on the project. The project is in turn expected to contribute an additional 3% increase in Kenya's GDP by 2020. The aim of the project is to cut over-dependence on Kenya's main port of Mombasa as well as open up Kenya's largely under-developed northern frontier, through creation of a second transport corridor. Key towns in the project are Lamu and Isiolo in Kenya, Juba in South Sudan and Addis Ababa in Ethiopia. Institutionalisation of the project The LAPSSET Corridor Project is the first single integrative infrastructure Project the Government has initiated and prepared under Vision 2030 Strategy Framework without external assistance. The project endeavors to deliver a Just and Prosperous middle income Kenya by the year 2030. Kenya is spearheading the development of Lamu Port-South Sudan-Ethiopia-Transport (LAPSSET) Corridor Project to strengthen the country's position as a gateway and a transport and logistics hub to the East African sub-region and the Great Lakes region to facilitate trade, promote regional economic integration and interconnectivity between African countries. The project is managed by the LAPSSET Corridor Development Authority (LCDA), which is domiciled under the Presidency. =Mandate of LAPSSET Corridor Development Authority= In March 2013, the LAPSSET Corridor Development Authority (LCDA) was established through the Presidential Order Kenya Gazette Supplement No. 51, Legal Notice No. 58, The LAPSSET Corridor Development Authority Order 2013 to plan, coordinate and manage the implementation of the Lamu Port-South Sudan-Ethiopia Transport Corridor Project. The Authority is domiciled in The Presidency in accordance with the Constitution of Kenya 2010. The LCDA is headed by Mr. Silvester Kasuku, MBS, CMILT, Director General/ Chief Executive Officer and Amb, Dr. Francis Muthaura, EGH, Chairman of the Board of the Authority. The functions of the Authority are as follows: *i. Plan, coordinate and sequence LAPSSET Corridor projects in collaboration with implementing ministries and agencies; *ii. Coordinate implementation of LAPSSET Corridor projects across implementing ministries and agencies; *iii. Provide leadership, direction and guidance in operations and implementation of the LAPSSET Corridor; *iv. Ensure implementation of all decisions and resolutions of the government; *v. Mobilize funds to project components using a variety of resources including budgetary resources from government, donor loans, infrastructure bonds and private finance; *vi. In collaboration with National and County government department, build the capacity of LAPSSET Corridor towns to manage urban growth resulting from LAPSSET Corridor investments; *vii. Promote the competitiveness and use of the LAPSSET Corridor for the transport of goods and people; and *viii. Provide a forum for all stakeholders of the LAPSSET Corridor. The LAPSSET Corridor Development Authority is the policy, implementation, operational coordination and technical oversight organ for the LAPSSET Corridor Project. The LAPSSET Corridor Development Authority has the inter-ministerial coordination committees composed of relevant ministries. LAPSSET Corridor Projects The Corporation is mandated to manage the development of the following infrastructure project components which are key Transport, Energy and Communication investments; *1.Lamu Port at Manda Bay (32 Berths including Associated Infrastructure) *2.Standard Gauge Railway Line from Lamu ‚Äì Isiolo - South Sudan (Juba) ‚Äì Ethiopia (Addis Ababa) *3. Highways from Lamu ‚Äì Isiolo - South Sudan (Juba) ‚Äì Ethiopia (Addis Ababa) *4.Crude Oil Pipeline from Lamu ‚Äì Isiolo ‚Äì Nakodok/Nadapal (South Sudan), and Product Oil Pipeline from Isiolo ‚Äì Moyale ‚Äì Addis Ababa (Ethiopia) *5. International Airports at Lamu, Isiolo, and Turkana (Lokichogio); *6.Resort Cities at Lamu, Isiolo and Lake Turkana *7.Merchant Oil Refinery at Isiolo. *8. Services related infrastructure Project Components namely; a. Malindi ‚Äì Garsen Road b. High Grand Falls Multipurpose Dam *i. Water Supply *ii. Power Supply; and c. Fibre Optic Cable / Communication d. Other generated and attracted investments in commercial and manufacturing sectors along the LAPSSET Corridor. In addition to this the project is also spearheading the development of associated infrastructure sub projects in particular the High Grand Falls that is envisaged to produce 500MW of power and provide water to Lamu city, Lamu Port and metropolis and irrigation of mega farms planned for the Tana Delta among other areas within the Corridor. The High Grand falls will be used to create a manmade Lake at its dam with a view to controlling perennial flooding within the lower Tana Basin. More importantly the LAPSSET Corridor infrastructure is being developed as a critical enabler meant to spur growth of other sectors of the economy within the Corridor. Of great significance is the rich agricultural value chain spanning over ten different economic crops whose implementation has begun with the establishment of mega irrigation schemes. Already both local and international agricultural investors are keen on taking investment opportunities in this area and respective County Governments within the corridor have started receiving enquiries from some of the interested investors. The LAPSSET Program therefore presents an investment opportunity that may be considered by the private sector investors including Pension, Insurance and saving Funds among other investors. =Economic Viability of LAPSSET Program= Project studies that were completed in 2011 on the LAPSSET Corridor project components showed great economic viability with most of the project components registering High Economic Internal Rates of Return of between 17% and 23.4% compared to acceptable industry minimum standard of 10% for infrastructure projects as shown in Table 1 below.

Note 2: Cargoes are generated by the Corridor itself. Higher figures than the above table can be realized. From the statistics provided, it is therefore evident that if the government structured the projects into bankable bundles, it would attract private sector investors to participate and invest in the projects. =Cost of LAPSSET Program= The seven key infrastructure project components of the LAPSSET Corridor Program require substantial amounts of resources with a budget estimate of US$24.5 billion, equivalent to KES 2 trillion at current exchange rates in construction costs. It is estimated that Lamu Port with its 22 berths alone will cost approximately US$3.1 billion, the Railway US$7.1 billion while the crude oil pipeline will cost a further estimate of US$3 billion for Lamu to Lokichar trunk line alone. Indeed, the figures indicated above are of no mean task and cannot be left to the Government‚Äôs limited resources alone. The Government has prioritised the participation of private sector in the development of LAPSSET Corridor infrastructure through infrastructure bonds and equity participation among other money market instruments. There is already significant private sector interest being registered towards the implementation of these project components hence the need has arisen for the government to structure and package bankable projects that are investor ready for uptake by private sector. Status of implementation of LAPSSET corridor projects The government undertook ground breaking for the LAPSSET Corridor Program at Lamu Port site on 2 March 2012, after which it commenced construction activities of various infrastructural facilities and services aimed at progressing implementation of LAPSSET Corridor Project. The ongoing construction works for various project activities are summarized below. =Lamu Port= LAPSSET Corridor Project is on course and so far construction activities for various facities at Lamu Port site are ongoing with progress for Lamu Port Building and Port Police and security facilities having achieved a completion rate of 95%. *i) Port Building: 95% complete. *ii) Police Station: 95% complete. *iii) Design review ongoing for the first three berths, with construction to begin in July 2014 *iv) The physical development plan and survey for the Port area has been completed. The Government has so far allocated KES 4.2 billion in preparation for the commencement of construction works for the first three berths. The government is also in the process of mobilising more resources from its own revenue resources as well as from private sector investors through equity and debt including bonds while mobilisation of more funds through equity and debt participation by investor for the construction of the first three berths and its associated infrastructure. These three berths are being constructed by China Communications Construction Company at a cost of nearly $480 million, and will reportedly be opened by 2020. =LAPSSET Highway Component= The LAPSSET highway component has been categorized in sections as indicated below: *Lamu ‚Äì Garissa (D568) - 250 km *Garissa ‚Äì Isiolo (C81,D586,B9) - 423 km *Isiolo ‚Äì Moyale (A2) - 505 km *Isiolo‚ÄìNadapal - 721 km Isiolo ‚Äì Marsabit ‚Äì Moyale, A2 It is important to note that significant progress has been made on the ongoing construction of LAPSSET Highway component, particularly the 505 km Isiolo-Moyale A2 Road costing approximately KES 46 billion and being funded jointly by the African Development Bank, European Union and the Government of Kenya. Indeed, Kenyans and Ethiopians will soon be able to enjoy improved transport and logistics services and transact business between Addis Ababa, Lamu and Nairobi. Isiolo ‚Äì Merille (136 km) The Isiolo ‚Äì Merille River Road, constitutes the first section of the 505 km road from Isiolo to Moyale which is part of the road linking Tunduma in Southern Tanzania with Addis Ababa in Ethiopia. The project construction works are complete. This project was funded by the African Development Bank at a cost of KES 6,318,130,428.27. Merille River ‚Äì Marsabit (121 km) This road constitutes the second section of the 505 km road from Isiolo to Moyale and Addis Ababa in Ethiopia. The road begins at Merille River and runs in a northerly direction and terminates at Marsabit. The construction works for this section has progressed at 10% having commenced in January 2013 and is scheduled for completion by January 2016 and is being funded by the European Union. The project will cost a total sum of KES 13.73 billion. Marsabit ‚Äì Turbi (123 km) The road begins in Marsabit at the junction with the road C82 and runs in a northerly direction and terminates in Turbi constituting the third section of the 505 km road from Isiolo to Moyale and Addis Ababa in Ethiopia. The construction works for this section has progressed to 47.4% having commenced in April 2011 and is being funded by the African Development Bank and is expected to be completed by March 2014. The project will cost a total sum of KES 13 billion. Turbi ‚Äì Moyale (125 km) Construction works have progressed to 11.5% completion having commenced in October 2012 for a period of 36 months. This section is being funded by the African Development Bank and is expected to be completed in December 2015. In addition to the above the Government of Kenya and the Government of South Sudan, working together with the World Bank recently completed feasibility studies and detailed engineering designs for the Lokichar - Nadapal ‚Äì Torit - Juba Road whose construction works will begin soon once finances are mobilised. This road project does present an opportunity for private sector participation. Furthermore, the Government of Kenya is currently considering mechanisms for participation by private sector investors to deliver the Lokichar - Isiolo - Garissa - Lamu Road and Lamu - Garsen Road through Engineering, Procurement, Finance and Construct (EPC). Delivery of the road provides immediate road connection between Lamu Port and Juba and Addis Ababa. *i. Lamu ‚Äì Garissa (D568) 250 km), Garissa ‚Äì Isiolo (C81,D586,B9) (423 km) and Isiolo - Ginyang for EPC mode *ii.

Kitale ‚Äì Lodwar ‚Äì Nadapal Road (623 km): Designs are 95% complete. *iv. Garsen ‚Äì Lamu Road (115 km): Design reviews complete. Awaiting mobilization of resources for construction. =Crude Oil Pipeline= Continued discovery of oil resources with the region has emboldened plans by regional Governments that are connected by the LAPSSET Corridor to build a crude oil pipeline between Lamu Port and Kenya‚Äôs oil fields in Turkana Basin and Uganda‚Äôs oil fields at Lake Albert‚Äôs Basin and South Sudan oil fields. The Government of Kenya is soon putting up an Expression of Interest to competitively select the appropriate investors for the development of the crude oil pipeline. =Electric Power Supply= In addition to the above the Government has prioritised the provision of appropriate infrastructural service aimed at supporting the massive investments planned for the LAPSSET Corridor. The Government has just completed the electric power connection for the Lamu Port of 220 kV transmission line from Rabai through Malindi and Garsen to Lamu. Construction of electric power transmission line has commenced to deliver electric power connection to key LAPSSET Corridor areas such as Garissa, Isiolo and Turkana. Already construction of 132 kV transmission line from Seven Folks/Kindaruma to Garissa is ongoing; construction of 132 kV transmission line from Mount Kenya region to Isiolo is ongoing. Plans for the construction of 400 kV transmission line from Lake Turkana to Suswa are at an advanced stage while plans are ongoing for the construction of 220 kV line from Garsen to Garissa. * Rabai ‚Äì Lamu 220 kV Transmission Line completed * Garsen 220 kV Transmission Line to commence soon * Lake Turkana ‚Äì Suswa 400 kV Transmission Line to commence * Lamu ‚Äì Garissa ‚Äì Isiolo ‚Äì Lokichar 220 kV Transmission Line planned * Kindaruma ‚Äì Garissa 132 kV Transmission line to complete construction by Dec 2014 * Masinga ‚Äì Isiolo 132 kV Transmission line to complete construction by Dec 2014 * Kamburu ‚Äì Isiolo 220 kV Transmission Line to complete Construction by Dec 2014 =Airports= The government has embarked on improving facilities at the three airports to provide for air travel services in the interim to enhance accessibility to the corridor. Improvement works on Lokichogio Airport were completed in the recent past and is already operational with scheduled flights landing at the airport. Provision of airport facilities will strengthen buildup of air transport and logistics services along the corridor in readiness for the construction of the three international airports at the three locations in the future. Kenya Civil Aviation Authority has already made plans to establish air transport safety, security and surveillance facilities and services to strengthen air transport and logistics in northern Kenya. Manda Lamu Airport The government recently completed lengthening of Lamu Manda Island Airport runway from 1.1 km to 2.3 km. Improvement works are already complete for the airport terminal building. Preparations are at an advanced stage towards the construction of a parallel taxiway and aircraft apron area to improve capacity of the airport. These improvements will enhance the capacity of Manda Lamu Airport that already has a strong scheduled flights clientele. Isiolo Airport The Government has completed construction works on the 1.2 km Isiolo Airport runway. Construction works are currently ongoing for Airport Terminal Building which is scheduled for completion by end of 2014. Kenya Airports Authority has made plans to operationalise the airport once facilities are in place by mid 2014. =Provision of Social Infrastructure, Services and Security= In addition to the ongoing physical works in to planned projects along the LAPSSET Corridor, the Government has commenced a comprehensive plan for the provision of social infrastructure and services so as to give LAPSSET Project a deserving human face. Panning for these social infrastructure and services will ensure that schools, health centres, towns, water and sanitation services, security services and other social amenities are provided at an optimal level to make LAPSSET Corridor areas secure, desirable, liveable and working environment and a place to nurture Kenya‚Äôs future generations. Recent developments in the LAPSSET corridor project area Since conclusion of the LAPSSET study, oil discoveries have been made in the Turkana area in Kenya with current recoverable crude oil reserves estimated at 600 Million Barrels. With these developments, the original plan and design for the crude oil pipeline has to be reviewed to accommodate these new discoveries. The Pipeline will now evacuate crude oil from Lokichar Oil fields in Kenya, Lake Albert Oil fields in Uganda and oil fields in South Sudan. As such considerations are being made to commence construction of crude oil pipeline from Lokichar to Lamu Port to evacuate Kenyan oil as more preparations are made to complete negotiations on the construction of joining crude oil pipelines from Uganda and South Sudan oil fields. In this event, the Lokichar to Lamu crude oil pipelines will be the trunk crude pipeline to accommodate crude oil from Uganda and South Sudan. Crude oil terminal tank farms will therefore be built at Lokichar and Lamu to manage the logistics of pumping crude oil through the pipeline as well as into the loading into ships for export. As a result, the governments of South Sudan and Kenya are preparing for the admission of the Uganda Crude Oil Pipeline component into the LAPSSET Corridor Crude Oil Pipeline Project. As a way forward, the tripartite Heads of State Infrastructure Summit held in Uganda on 20 February 2014, agreed to allow Kenya to proceed with the Expression of interest for the development of the crude oil pipeline between Lamu and Lokichar oil fields to evacuate Kenyan oil as well as prepare for the construction of connecting lines from South Sudan‚Äôs and Ugandan Oil fields. In order to support the development of the crude oil pipeline, the Government has identified the need to simultaneously construct the Lamu-Lokichar Road alongside the pipeline. As an early delivery strategy, the Ministries of Energy and Petroleum as well as Transport and Infrastructure have adopted an integrated approach for the development of the crude oil pipeline and the road from Lamu-Lokichar.  Participating countries  Participating countries include:  Funding The Development Bank of South Africa will fund construction of LAPSSET to KES 126 billion (US$1.5 billion). Lamu Port and Manda Bay Lamu Port is expected to consist of 32 berths when complete, will cost US $3.5 billion and be 1,000 acres in size. The port will be a deep water port at 18 metres depth. From bids requested by the Kenyan Government, the first phase of the port will include 3 deep water berths with a capability of handling ships with a deadweight capacity of up to 100,000 tonnes. The port will be built at Manda Bay and is expected to be operational starting December 2012. A consortium of companies led by China Communications Construction Company(CCCC) was reported to have won the bid for construction of the first three berths at Lamu port. The cost of the project is valued at KES 41 billion (US$484 million). CCCC is associated with China Road and Bridge Corporation(CRBC) which has historically secured many road construction and other tenders in Kenya. Standard gauge railway line to Juba A railway line will run from Lamu to Juba, a distance of , and will be capable of handling trains with speeds of up to per hour for passenger trains, and perhaps per hour for freight trains. This will be at an estimated cost of $7.1 billion and is to be completed by 2015. By 2030, the railway line is expected to handle 30 daily trains to Juba and 52 to Addis Ababa. Road network LAPSSET road projects will run from Lamu to Isiolo and onwards to Juba and Addis Ababa through Moyale. This will be a two-lane highway and will cost $1.4 billion. The road from Lamu will pass through Hola and Bura to Garissa. From Garissa, the main branch will run to Isiolo while a second branch will run off to Mwingi and Matuu for exploitation of coal in the Kitui Basin. Isiolo will be linked to Nairobi through one route, to Nakodok, near Lokichogio via another and to Moyale via the third route. Southern Sudan will be in charge of constructing a route from Nakodok to Juba while Ethiopia will construct a road from Moyale to Addis Abbaba =Isiolo ‚Äì Moyale Road= Construction and upgrading of the Isiolo ‚Äì Merille road which is part of LAPSSET commenced in 2007 and the road was finished in 2011. The road was upgraded into a two-lane tarmac road. Construction of the Marsabit ‚Äì Turbi road, also part of LAPSSET, commenced 29 August 2011, with an expected delivery date of 4 April 2014. =Moyale ‚Äì Addis Ababa road= Construction of the 193 km Ageremariam-Yabelo- Mega already began. Oil pipeline The Oil Pipeline is expected to cost $4 billion. The crude oil pipeline will run from Lamu to South Sudan and Addis Ababa. Construction was originally expected to begin by end of 2013 once feasibility studies contracted to German company ILF were complete. South Sudan is optimistic of transporting its first oil via the pipeline in 2014 if construction begins immediately after completion of feasibility studies. Oil refinery A proposed oil refinery in Lamu will cost $2.5 billion and is expected to refine 120,000 barrels of oil a day. Three resort cities Proposed resort cities at Lamu, Isiolo and Lokichogio on the shores of Lake Turkana will cost $1.2 billion. =Isiolo Resort City= The Isiolo resort city is to be established under a public private partnership at a cost of KES 18.9 billion. In 2012, the Isiolo County Council was asked to set 6,500 acres of land aside for establishment of the resort city. The site is located at Kipsing Gap, 20 kilometres west of Isiolo town. The site was identified by Japanese Port Consultants after a nine-month feasibility study. The consultants also developed a conceptual design for the resort city with more than 10 preliminary models of the city. The plans include rules on land usage and guidance on private sector and local community involvement. The plans also cater for growth and development of the city for the next 20 to 30 years. Under Kenya's new constitution, it will be mandatory for the government to get consent from the locals before commencing with the project. Residents will be compensated for the acquisition. The local council will then acquire the land title and make money from leasing out the land and charging rates. The city will be situated between Katim hill and Oldonyo Degishu hill. Neighbouring game parks and national reserves include Lewa Wildlife Conservancy in the south, Buffalo Springs and Shaba National Reserve to the North, Samburu Game Reserve and Ewaso Ng'iro River to the West. The area also boasts a wide variety of plants and animals, including the big five, leading to it also being known as the Jewel in the crown. Kipsing Gap was picked in preference of Kulamawe and Archers Post due to security, accessibility, cultural diversity, natural diversity, wildlife, water availability, electricity, sewer system among other factors. In January 2012, 32 councillors led by chairman Adan Ali and Town Clerk Morris Ogolla and legislators, professionals, women group leaders were briefed by government officials on the importance of the resort city. Attractions will include three star to six star hotels, a local art and craft museum, theatres, conference centres and cultural events. LAPSSET Development Authority President Mwai Kibaki, through a special gazette notice, announced the formation of the authority on 1 April 2013 with the task of managing the project on behalf of Kenya's government. The authority shall be headquartered in Nairobi and have offices in Lamu, Isiolo, Lokichogio, Marsabit and Moyale. A director general will head the 11 member board that will include five state officials, private sector representatives and a chairman appointed by the president. The authority will push for public private partnerships to help in implementation of the project. Additional infrastructure This includes proposed power generation facilities, water systems and communication facilities. This component of LAPSSET is expected to cost $2.5 billion. Criticism The LAPSSET corridor project has come under criticism for its social and environmental impacts.

It was a development of the of armoured cruisers, and was the sole representative of its type. It served during the First World War being eventually sunk as a target in 1937. Description Jules Michelet was laid down in June 1904 as a modified version of the Leon Gambetta class of armoured cruisers. It was slightly longer and heavier than the previous class, and while it had a similar machinery layout, with 28 boilers supplying vertical triple expansion steam engines which drove three propeller shafts, the engines delivered more power, allowing the ship to reach a design speed of . The ship was fitted with four funnels. The main armament was four guns in twin turrets, one each fore and aft, while secondary armament was twelve guns, eight of which were in single turrets and the remaining four in casemates. Although Jules Michelet had four fewer 164 mm guns than the Leon Gambetta class, with single turrets instead of twin turrets, both the main and secondary guns were more powerful models than those carried in the earlier ships. A tertiary anti-torpedo-boat battery of twenty four guns was mounted in casements, while the ship's armament was completed by two submerged 450 mm (18 in) torpedo tubes.

These ships, along with a flotilla of twelve destroyers, was to steam to Philippeville no 4 August, but the German cruisers had bombarded the port the previous day. This attack, coupled with reports that suggested the Germans would try to break out of the Mediterranean into the Atlantic, prompted the French high command to send Jules Michelet and the First Light Division further west, to Algiers.Corbett & Newbolt, pp. 61-62 After the German ships escaped to Constantinople, rather than attack the French troop transports from North Africa as had been expected, Edgar Quinet joined the rest of the French fleet in its blockade of the Adriatic Sea, based out of Navarino.Gardiner & Gray, p. 193 The fleet, commanded by Admiral Augustin Bou√© de Lapeyr√®re, had assembled by the night of 15 August; the following morning, it conducted a sweep into the Adriatic and encountered the Austro-Hungarian cruiser .

In 1086 Waithe contained 30.7 households, four villagers and one freemen, 0.3 ploughlands and of meadow. In 1066 lordship of the manor was held by Siward Barn, this transferred to Odo of Bayeux in 1086, with Ivo Taillebois as Tenant-in-chief to William I. The village is the site of a deserted medieval village, indicated by earthworks, trackways and ditch enclosures, and 13th- to 18th-century pottery finds.

In a legal cause c√©l√®bre which became known as the Case of the Dean of St Asaph, he was tried and convicted on a charge of seditious libel in August 1784, but was discharged by the Court of King's Bench a few months later without being punished. Early and private life Shipley was born at Midgham in Berkshire, the only son of Jonathan Shipley. His father was a clergyman who served as Dean of Winchester from 1760 to 1769, as Bishop of Landaff briefly in 1769, and then as Bishop of St Asaph from 1769 to 1789. His uncle, William Shipley, was a founder of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce (which later became the Royal Society of Arts). His mother, Anna-Maria Mordaunt, was a niece of the Earl of Peterborough. He was educated at Westminster School until 1760 and then Winchester College, and he studied at Christ Church, Oxford, where his father had been a canon. He followed his father's vocation to become a priest in the Church of England. He was quickly appointed to several lucrative church offices. His father appointed him as vicar of Ysceifiog in March 1770, and then vicar of Wrexham in 1771 and rector of Llangwn in 1772 (later exchanged for Corwen, and then Llanarmon-yn-I√¢l). He became chancellor of the diocese of St Asaph in 1773, and Dean of St Asaph on 27 May 1774. He retained both of these offices until his death in 1826. Trial for seditious libel Shipley was famously tried for seditious libel in 1784, after he read an anonymous pamphlet at a public meeting in January 1783. The pamphlet, The Principles of Government, in a Dialogue between a Scholar and a Peasant, advocated political reforms. Shipley arranged for a few copies, with his own amendments, to be printed in Wrexham. Shipley's political opponent, the High Sheriff of Flintshire, Thomas FitzMaurice (brother of the former Prime Minister William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne) complained to the public authorities. After they declined to prosecute Shipley, FitzMaurice sought a private prosecution. Meanwhile, William Jones‚ÄîShipley's brother-in-law since he married Shipley's eldest sister Anna-Maria in April 1783‚Äîhad confessed that he was the author of the pamphlet; he was not prosecuted but instead confirmed as a new judge of the Supreme Court of Bengal in Calcutta. Shipley was indicted at the Wrexham great sessions in April 1783 for publishing a seditious libel, and the trial was scheduled to be heard at the Denbighshire grand sessions in Wrexham that September, with judge Lloyd Kenyon presiding. The Society for Constitutional Information retained the barrister Thomas Erskine to act as Shipley's defence counsel. The trial was postponed, and finally heard by a jury at the Shrewsbury Assizes in August 1784, with Mr Justice Francis Buller presiding. Buller followed a submission of the prosecution‚Äîwhich accorded with general legal practice at the time‚Äîand directed that the jury was merely to reach a finding on whether the words were in fact published and on the meaning of the words (the innuendoes) as laid; but ruled that whether the words constituted a libel or not was a question of law for the court (i.e. the judge) to decide. However, the jury gave a verdict which stated that Shipley was guilty of publishing only, not of libel. Buller intervened to ask them to deliver a verdict on whether the pamphlet was libellous, but they refused, insisting that Shipley was guilty of \\"publishing only\\". Nevertheless, Buller held that the charges were made out, and convicted Shipley. Erskine brought an appeal to the Court of King's Bench in November 1784, arguing for a new trial on the grounds that the jury had been misdirected by Buller. The Lord Chief Justice, Lord Mansfield, turned down the request, but ruled that no part of the publication was criminal, and Shipley was discharged, to great public celebration in London and in north Wales. The case was instrumental in advancing the cause to return the decision of whether a publication is a libel to the jury, rather than being decided by the judge, finally enacted in Charles James Fox's Libel Act 1792 (32 Geo. III c. 60). Later life Although Shipley was discharged, his notoriety ended his chances of emulating his father by becoming a bishop, and he remained Dean of St Asaph until his death over 40 years later. He busied himself in arranging for repairs and alterations to the structure of St Asaph Cathedral. During his term in office, the chapter house was demolished in 1779, the choir was rebuilt, and a new episcopal throne, pulpit and reredos were installed. Many of these alterations were funded by the St Asaph Cathedral Act 1814. Shipley died at his home, Bodrhyddan Hall, near St Asaph, and was buried at Rhuddlan. Family life Shipley married Penelope Yonge in April 1777. His wife was the daughter and co-heiress of Ellis Yonge, and her maternal great-grandfather was Sir John Conway, 2nd Baronet. The Conway family owned Rhuddlan Castle and a sugar plantation on St Kitts. The marriage made the Shipley family of the wealthiest in north Wales. They had five sons and three daughters before his wife had died in childbirth in November 1789. His eldest son, William Shipley (1778‚Äì1820), was Whig MP for Flint Boroughs from 1807 to 1812 and for St Mawes from 1812 to 1813, but was killed in a shooting accident before his father's death. His grandson, also William, adopted the name Conway after the Dean's death. His second and third sons, Mordaunt and Robert-John, died young. His fourth son, Conway Shipley (1782‚Äì1808), joined the Royal Navy, and served in the battle of the Glorious First of June in 1794, later commanded the corvette HMS Hippomenes when it captured the French privateer Egyptienne, and was killed in action commanding the frigate HMS Nymphe in the blockade of the River Tagus in 1808. His fifth son became a clergyman and was the only one to survive his father. His eldest daughter, Penelope, married Dr Pelham Warren, a physician and later FRS; the second, Anna Maria, married Colonel Charles Dashwood; and the third, Amelia, married the Revd Reginald Heber, later Bishop of Calcutta.

On 1 November 1944, a small scale air raid occurred.Carter. The Army Air Forces in World War II: Combat Chronology, 1941‚Äì1945 This was followed on 23 November by a midnight fly-over by a lone camera-equipped B-29 Superfortress on a reconnaissance mission. However, a major air raid did not occur until the morning of 7 August 1945. During this attack, 135 B-29 Superfortress bombers of the USAAF 20th Air Force, 58th 73rd, 313th, and 314th Bombardment Wings launched from Guam, Saipan and Tinian. They were joined by 48 P-51 Mustang escort fighters deployed from Iwo Jima. Arriving over the target area at 10:13 AM, twelve B-29s bombed the Toyokawa Naval Arsenal, while the remaining bombers concentrated on Toyokawa's civilian population center, and the P-51s strafed targets of opportunity. A total of 3,256 500-lb bombs (813 tons) was dropped on the city from an altitude of 15,000‚Äì17,000 feet.Bradley. No Strategic Targets Left. Civilian casualty estimates range from 2,544 to 2,677 people killed. Victims included 452 schoolchildren and teenaged girls, some of whom had been conscripted and many of whom had volunteered to work at the Naval Arsenal. Japanese anti-aircraft fire damaged 21 B-29s during the raid, one of which crashed into the ocean near Iwo Jima. There were no American fatalities. Another B-29 lost course and dropped its bombs on the rural village of Futamata (now part of Hamamatsu, Shizuoka).

It was declared Bien de Inter√©s Cultural (a national monument) in 1977. It was designed by the architect, Ventura Rodr√≠guez, in 1772. Location The Palace of Altamira was a building of great magnitude, and which occupied an entire block, up to the Calle de San Bernardo (or Calle Ancha de San Bernardo as it was then called to distinguish it from the Calle Angosta de San Bernardo, know called Calle de la Aduana). This area was the axis around which the aristocratic residences of that time were grouped, until the next century when it was replaced by the Castellana. In addition to the aforementioned San Bernardo and Flor Alta, the palace had fa√ßades towards the Libreros and Marques de Leganes streets. Construction  Construction did not begin until 1788, but at the celebrations of the coronation of Charles IV in September of the following year a representation of what the building would be like once work was completed was shown to him. On seeing the magnificence of what was presented he feared it could overshadow his own palace, also located at not too great a distance. This made him start to hinder its progress, with the result that, finally, from the original project only one of the bays was built, with a total area of 1344 square meters. Other versions say that these changes were simply of a financial nature. The project included a monumental staircase, two courtyards, one with garden beds of French style, and a large oval floor chapel, all of which failed to materialize. Remodelling In 1887 the architect Mariano Belmas directed works that were undertaken to aesthetically standardize the building, especially an important part of the fa√ßade which had been left unfinished. the interior was already compartmentalized to accommodate office use by the twentieth century until they were later closed, remaining that way for over a decade, severely deteriorated. Finally, after acomplex rehabilitation, directed by Gabriel Allende Gil de Viedma, it has been housing, since October 2005, the seat of the Istituto Europeo di Design. Proprietor A famous owner of this palace was Vicente Osorio de Moscoso y Ponce de Leon. He was Grande of Spain, Duke of Sessa and Montemar, Marquis of Astorga, Leganes, Ayamonte and San Rom√°n, Count of Cabra and Altamira, Viscount of Iznajar, among others. He kept his large collection of paintings in the palace, one of the first in Spain. Moscoso y Ponce de Leon's will, made on August 7, 1861, reflects the works of art that he owned. He left several paintings by Goya (now in the Royal Palace of Madrid), Federico Madrazo and several others to Queen Elizabeth II, cousin of the wife of his eldest son, Jose Maria Osorio Moscoso y Carvajal, the Infanta Luisa Teresa de Borb√≥n y Borb√≥n Dos Sicilias (daughter of Infante Francisco de Paula de Borb√≥n).

Facts Livingstone had bought a Daimler Dart from Roskilly, who ran a classic car stable. The car required some further work which Roskilly agreed to undertake. The work was done by Friday, and the car was left in the garage over the long weekend. Over the weekend the car was stolen. Mr Livingstone sued Mr Roskilly for the value of the car. The two questions before the District Court were, first, whether Mr Roskilly had taken all reasonable care to prevent the loss of the car and, secondly, whether he was exempt from liability by reason of the notice that was displayed in the garage workshop. The District Court Judge held that the lock on the garage door was inadequate, particularly as the key to the car was left in its ignition. Mr Roskilly was therefore held to have acted negligently. The sole question on appeal was whether the notice that was displayed in the workshop excluded Mr Roskilly's liability in negligence for the bailment of the car. The sign read: \\"ALL VEHICLES STORED and DRIVEN at OWNERS RISK All Care Taken: NO RESPONSIBILITY.\\" Thomas J held there was no exemption. The sign was to be interpreted such that \\"All Care\\" meant that the car would be fully secured at the garage. Only after being secured would the \\"No Responsibility\\" clause be triggered, covering Roskilly from any damage arising. As the car was not secure, and negligently so, the responsibility clause was not triggered. Therefore, Mr Roskilly was not exempted from liability in negligence.

Hazelton made his debut in county cricket for Buckinghamshire in the 1912 Minor Counties Championship against Berkshire. He played for Buckinghamshire right up to the 1914 season, which was curtailed due to the start of World War I. Following the conclusion of the war, Hazelton appeared in a first-class match for Essex against the Australian Imperial Forces in 1919, though this only appearance for Essex came with no success with either bat or ball. Following this match, Hazelton continued to play Minor counties cricket for Buckinghamshire, he would wait four more years after his lone appearance for Essex for his next first-class appearance, which eventually came in 1924 for the Minor Counties against HDG Leveson-Gower's XI at The Saffrons in Eastbourne. His next first-class match came for the East of England against the touring New Zealanders in 1927, a match in which he took his maiden first-class five wicket haul, with figures of 5/68 in the New Zealanders first-innings. His next first-class appearance came the following season for the Minor Counties against the touring West Indians, with Hazelton taking career best figures of 6/45 in the West Indians first-innings, this after he took 4 wickets in their first-innings, which gave him his only ten wicket haul in a match. Further first-class appearances came for the Gentleman in 1928, the North, the Minor Counties against the touring South Africans in 1929, and the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1930 against Yorkshire.

He also published some poetry and collections of songs. He was Count of Stolberg-Wernigerode from 1771 until his death.  Life  Henry Ernest was the eldest surviving son of Count Christian Ernest of Stolberg- Wernigerode. His mother, Countess Sophie Charlotte of Leiningen-Westerburg, was heavily influenced by Pietism and raised her son in this spirit. Henry Ernest studied at the universities in Halle and G√∂ttingen and, already in 1739, he received a prebend at the cathedral chapter at Halberstadt; this appointment was confirmed by King Frederick II of Prussia. Also in 1739, he was awarded the Order of the Dannebrog by King Christian VI of Denmark. His father involved him in the ruling of the county from a young age and after 1742 he consistently attended meetings of the Chamber of Wernigerode. He was involved, for example, in the development of the peat industry on Mount Brocken, in 1743 establishing a peat works on the Brocken named Heinrichsh√∂he. During his father's lifetime he enlarged the hymnology department of the count's library, and collected and composed himself almost 400 hymns. He also supported the popular poet Anna Louisa Karsch. In 1763 he had Johann Georg Ziesenis make him a painting showing King Frederick II of Prussia down to the knee. After his father's death on 25 October 1771, the 55-year-old Henry Ernest took up the government in the county of Wernigerode, where he promoted the most pietistic form of religious life.  Marriage and issue  Henry Ernest was married on 11 December 1738 in Sorau to Marie Elizabeth, daughter of Count Erdmann II of Promnitz.

He is best known for his biography of General Andranik Ozanyan. Biography He was born in 1922 in Kessab. After graduating from the Armenian Evangelical School, he studied at Aleppo College. Then, in the summer of 1949, Chalabian moved to Beirut and took a position in the physiology department of the American University of Beirut (AUB). In 1977, Chalabian and his family immigrated to the Detroit, USA, where Chalabian worked as public relations director at the AGBU Alex Manoogian School.Antranig Chalabian In 1984 he published his first historical book General Andranik and the Armenian Revolutionary Movement. In 1989 at the History Department of the Yerevan State University he was awarded a doctorate in history. The book was later translated into English, Turkish, Greek and Spanish. The book became an instant best seller (75,000 copies sold only in Armenia). Academician Mkrtich G. Nersisyan called the book a \\"valuable historical work resulted by many years of persistent research\\".M. Nersisyan, Patmutyan Keghdzararnere (articles), Yerevan, \\"Gitutyun\\", 1998, p. 216 Chalabian is also the author of Revolutionary Figures (1991), Armenia After Coming of Islam and Dro books. Chalabian received numerous accolades and recognition. The mayor of Southfield designated in 2005 a day as Dr. Antranig Chalabian Day in recognition of his goodwill ambassadorship of the city through his readers worldwide. He was an invited contributor to Military History Magazine, and regularly contributed articles to the Armenian publications like Spurk, Nayiri, Chanasser, Armenian Mirror-Spectator and Andranikological Review papers. Before writing and publishing his books, Chalabian collaborated with Dr. Stanley Kerr after discovering Kerr's personal notes in the attic of the Physiology Department. Kerr had moved to New Jersey after retiring in 1965 from his distinguished career as the Chairman of the Biochemistry Department of the American University of Beirut. However, he had left his notes behind assuming that the notes were long lost through the years. Kerr had kept his notes and taken hitherto unpublished pictures while serving in Near East Relief. In 1919, Kerr was transferred to Marash, in central Anatolia, where he headed the American relief operations. The outcome of their collaborative work was the publication of Kerr's The Lions of Marash in 1973. While collaborating with Kerr, Henry Wilfrid Glockler, a one-time controller at AUB and a neighbor of the Kerrs in Princenton, entrusted Chalabian his personal memoirs. Chalabian edited the memoirs and had it published in Beirut in 1969 by Sevan publishing house. The book is titled Interned in Turkey.

Biographical sketches of the graduates of Yale college with annals of the college history, Franklin Bowditch Dexter, Holt, 1896 Biography Beebe was born in Danbury, Connecticut in 1717, the son of one of the town founders. He studied theology at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. Beebe married Ruth Curtiss, the daughter of Ephraim and Elizabeth (Stiles) Curtiss, in 1749 and they raised five daughters and two sons; the youngest son, David Lewis Beebe, graduated from Yale College in 1785 and followed in his father's profession. Besides his pastoral duties, Mr. Beebe also managed a large farm, was part owner of the local grist and sawmills and he owned slaves. One slave in particular was Peg, the wife of free slave Nero Hawley. Since Beebe owned Peg, he owned all of her children too, who were subsequently emancipated by their father after Beebe's death. Beebe died in office on September 8, 1785, in his 68th year. His wife Ruth died on July 29, 1818 at the age of 94. Beebe's gravestone at the Unity Burial Ground reads: Ministry In the fall of 1746, the Fairfield East Association of Ministers contacted the Church at the Unity Parish in Trumbull and advised them that Reverend Beebe was ready to become the minister at their parish. Beebe was ordained and installed at Unity Parish in May 1747. Beebe had his work cut out for him though, as the church had become scattered in 1744 by the conversion to Episcopacy by the last pastor, Reverend Richardson Miner. Under Beebe's leadership, 167 parishioners were added to the Unity Church rolls. Reverend Beebe's ministry in Trumbull lasted for 38 years until he died in office on September 8, 1785, in his 68th year.

His eldest son James, was a Captain in the Continental Army and wintered with George Washington at the Valley Forge winter encampment. Beebe was a staunch supporter of the Revolution. One night he organized a public meeting at his house to talk about the Revolution. While he was addressing the people, gunfire was heard and fires were seen in the distance as if the British were coming. Beebe suspected this was a trick. So, he sent a small party by a back road to check it out and to cut off the retreat of this scouting party. They captured the culprits, who turned out to be young men from the town who had burned some cornstalks and were playing a joke on the people at the meeting to test their patriotism.History of Stratford, Connecticut 1639‚Äì1939, Wm.

In 1703 he removed to Carmarthen to become pastor of the presbyterian congregation, and received in his house students for the Christian ministry. He has been regarded as the founder of the Welsh Academy, from the fact that the education of divinity students first assumed under him a collegiate form.

He is supposed to have retired in 1718, and he died in 1720.

The ESHPh publicly hosts symposia, publishes journals, and distributes the \\"International Letter\\" to its members. The ESHPh is actively chronicling the historiography of the history of photography in Europe. History The founding of the Europ√§ischen Gesellschaft f√ºr die Geschichte der Photographie (ESHPh) [European Society for the History of Photography] took place at the first general meeting on 19 November 1978 in Leverkusen, Germany. The decision to form a society of this nature had been taken one year earlier in Antwerp, Belgium. A group of museum curators and photographic historians from six European countries - notably Laurent Roosens (of the Sterckshof Museum, Antwerp), Margaret Harker (the UK's Royal Photographic Society) and Rolf Krauss (German Society for Photography) - came together to establish a new society dealing with the history of photography in a European context. Since 2001, the presidential headquarters are to be found in Vienna. From 1978 until 1989, those headquarters were in Antwerp; thereafter, until 2001, in Croydon, UK. It is currently based in Vienna, although the website is hosted by the Donau University Krems, Austria. The aims of the ESHPh The ESHPh was founded with the primary aim of researching the historical development of photography from its origins up to the present and integrating it within a European context within the social political matrix of photography's inherent interdisciplinary nature. Photographers, general historians and historians of photography, philosophers, sociologists, ethnologists, academics, curators and private collectors as well as many important European institutions and some from further afield all belong to the ESHPh. Alongside its research activities, the ESHPh takes part in a worldwide exchange of information. It supports both the recognition of the history of photography as an academic discipline and the establishment of chairs in the discipline at European universities. From 1981 until 2004, the society has held symposia in various locations in Europe, as evidenced by diverse publications. For its 30th anniversary in 2008, the ESHPh celebrated an internationally attended photography congress at the Austrian Academy of Sciences, in Vienna, from 6‚Äì8 November 2008. This anniversary event was accompanied by an English language commemorative publication and took place as the theoretical focus of the European Month of Photography 2008 in Vienna. The ESHPh as a society was entered in the Austrian Register of Societies on 3 March 2004. However, the seat of society is connected to the presidency. The first general meeting, at which the board was elected, took place on 8 June in the WestLicht Gallery in Vienna. The new Executive Committee of the ESHPh was elected at the Society's annual general assembly that was held in Vienna on 4 November 2010, at the invitation of the Department for Pictures at the Austrian National Library.

It served to formulise the direction of the ESHPh and give an overview of the \\"picture\\" from trans-disciplinarian perspectives. =Photohistorica= Photohistorica: Serial Literature Index of the European Society for the History of Photography consisted of a bibliographical listing, with abstracts, of articles that had appeared in serial publications of the relevant years of publication. The first issue in May 1978 was a bibliographic listing only, but thereafter most bibliographic entries were accompanied by a short abstract. Apart from that pioneering issue of May 1978, each issue was double-numbered (such as 02/03) and except for 1979 and 1981 two double-numbered issues appeared annually (i.e. covering 1992 the two issues were numbers 50/51 and 52/53 containing abstract No.s 6656-6963 and 8964-7229). Karel van Deuren (the editor throughout the 1980s), Dr. Laurent Roosens (inaugural President of ESHPh), and Luc Salu (librarian of the Museum voor Fotographie, Antwerp) were the first compilers of the bibliography and abstracts. The production of those twenty‚Äìseven double-numbered issues of Photohistorica of 1978-1992 made possible in Belgium by annual grants provided until 1993 by Agfa‚ÄìGevaert. From the remaining funds provided by Agfa-Gevaert, a detailed Cumulative Index was sent out to members of ESHPh in mid‚Äì1994. For some years, the office of the ESHPh (under the society's President Prof. Margaret Harker Farrand) was based in England, and 1993-94 witnessed two years of financial insecurity for the Society, with an income apparently limited solely to the subscriptions of its members. Yet the production of a bibliography of articles on the history of photography from current serials had been of undoubted value and a justified function of the ESHPh. After a lapse of two years, a new volunteer - R. Derek Wood (historian of early photography) - from its members in England was found to compile and edit a renewed bibliography. Thus with Agfa-Gevaert (Belgium) making a grant to ESHPh in February 1995 to cover printing costs, another two double-numbered issues (No. 54/55 and 56/57) of a renewed Photohistorica covering the years 1993 and 1994 could be published. However, with a low membership inevitable for a specialist subject area unable to provide a strong financial base, both publications (Photohistorica and PhotoResearcher) of ESHPh could not continue in the late 1990s - except that is for ESHPh member Audrey Linkman of Manchester compiling and editing a final Photohistorica (issue 58). It provided 296 abstracts of articles on the history of photography, published in serials, mainly, but not exclusively, during the half-year January to June 1997. Unlike all the earlier issues (of a square 20x20cm format), issue 58 was printed in A4 format and a new categorisation of subjects was introduced. This account of Photohistorica is derived mainly from R. Derek Wood's preface and postscript to the issues for 1993-1994.

Plot Radha (Manjula) is a medical student and daughter of a wealthy man, Raghupati Rao (Nagabhushanam). While on a trip to Simla, she meets and falls in love with Gopi (Sobhan Babu); they get intimate with each other. Gopi asks Raghupati Rao for his daughter's hand, but he refuses, on the ground that the hard-up Gopi is not worthy of her. Gopi leaves Radha a note, explaining that her father refused the alliance and that he is heading to meet his mother, who is very sick. Raghupati Rao gets hold of the letter before Radha. He changes the letter with a fake one that says Gopi is going away because Raghupati Rao has refused to provide any monetary compensation. Years later, Gopi and Radha are fated to meet again. This time, Gopi is accompanied by a handicapped boy, Babu (Master Tito), while Radha is about to get engaged to Dr. Ramesh (Jaggayya). It is revealed that Babu is Gopi and Radha's son. Gopi has come to Dr. Ramesh for Babu's treatment. Radha was pregnant when her father sent Gopi away. She gave birth to a baby, but her father told her that it was stillborn. Gopi took his son and promised Raghupati Rao that he would never tell Radha about the child. Dr. Ramesh treats Babu as Radha tries to hide her past from Dr. Ramesh. Radha learns the truth about Babu's birth and confronts her father, who confesses and asks her forgiveness while Babu is united with his parents.

They are classified on the same rank (historically called \\"Class\\") and lying between chondrites and achondrites. They are called primitive because they are achondrites that have retained much of their original chondritic properties. Very characteristic are relic chondrules and chemical compositions close to the composition of chondrites. These observations are explained as melt residues, partial melting, or extensive recrystallization. History The concept of primitive achondrites was first summarized in 1983. In 2006 a classification was published that assigned 7 groups to the primitive achondrites, but the classification remains controversial. The authors define primitive achondrites as meteorites \\"that exceeded their solidus temperature on the parent body\\" and thus would partially melt. Meteorites that have been fully melted are included if they did not reach isotopic equilibrium on their parent body. Description There are many indicators why some achondrites are deemed primitive. Some contain relic chondrules (e.g. Acapulcoite, Lodranite) and some have oxygen isotope ratios that are similar to chondrites. There are similarities in trace element concentrations between primitive achondrites and chondrites. A textural indicator can be observed in petrographic thin sections. If an achondrite is primitive it formed through recrystallization and will have many 120¬∞ grain boundaries. Normal achondrites form by crystallizing from a magma and will show magmatic textures. Lodranites are for example seen as residues of partial melting, while acapulcoites are seen as partial melts, but both were produced by partial melting. Ureileites and brachinites remain uncertain and could either be explained as residues or cumulates.

Erin Jean Maria Spanevello (April 27, 1987 ‚Äì May 28, 2008) was a Canadian fashion model active in the late 2000s before dying from a drug overdose at the age of 21. Born of Austrian and Italian descent in British Columbia in 1987, Erin dabbled in a variety of disciplines before modeling became her career. Outside of modeling, as a young woman she enjoyed spending time with close friends and had a number of interests including swimming, competitive gymnastics, ballet and jazz dancing. Erin began modeling part-time in her teens, which allowed her to satiate her desire to travel, visiting places such as Austria, Italy, Germany and Brazil. Since she was still quite young, her modeling trips were frequently chaperoned by her parents. However, just like any other teenager, Erin kept in close contact with her circle of friends through the Internet, no matter where in the world she happened to be. Her friends (amongst of whom include her boyfriend at the time of her death, Henry, and her best friend, Ren√©e) have shared that Erin was genuinely a kind, caring, loving and compassionate individual, who was happy and always willing to give others the shirt off her back. It is said that Erin had a heart of gold and an almost angelic-like spirit of generosity, matched with a smile that would light up any room. Her friends have emotionally remarked about her stunning natural beauty, and vibrant attractive personality. Erin was eventually signed with four modeling agencies including Paris' NEXT Model Management and New York's IMG Models, becoming successful Canadian fashion model. She modeled in advertisements for AlekWek 1933, West Edmonton Mall, Cuche and FloSport, and walked for several brands including Sports Club LA. Erin had decided to pursue a career in graphic design and marketing, according to her mother and father, Catherine and Artur Spanevello. She also continued working part-time as a model, which allowed her to continue to travel, which is one of the perks Erin adored most about her fashion modeling career. In Vancouver on May 28, 2008, at 6:30 a.m., Spanevello fell into an irreversible coma after a presumed drug overdose in which Erin was said to have been taking ecstasy and GHB, then died from cardiac and respiratory failure induced by a lethal dose of the synthetic drugs. She was only 21 years old. Erin Spanevello's funeral service to celebrate her life was held at St. David's United Church, 1525 Taylor Way, West Vancouver, BC on Thursday, June 5, 2008 at 1:00 pm. Private cremation followed pursuant to the wishes of the family. To honour Erin's spirit, it was asked in advance that anyone planning to attend the funeral service please wear white. The Spanevello family also requested that in lieu of flowers to consider donating to the Orfund Foundation instead. After her death, in November 2009, her story was featured as the main subject in an anti-drug campaign by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. As part of its campaign, the RCMP has printed posters featuring Spanevello's smiling face juxtaposed against the slogan: \\"the agony of ecstasy ... the end of a life.\\" There was also a feature on the RCMP website as part of the anti-drug campaign \\"Erin's Story,\\" that was written by her heartbroken mother, Catherine. Catherine Spanevello also urged other parents to educate themselves about addiction, overdose, and especially about the popular drugs that are available to our children nowadays. It also included further information about the chemicals in MDMA (Ecstasy), the dangers of ecstasy, and practical tips for parents.

Biography Norayr Musheghian was born on 2 November 1935 in Yerevan to Armenian parents, survivors of Armenian Genocide from Mush and Sebastia who arrived in Yerevan as orphan children. The first sport Musheghian took up was gymnastics, but due to injury he was forced to abandon it. He began wrestling in 1952 under the coaching of Artashes Nazaryan. Initially, he could not choose between freestyle and Greco-Roman wrestling, but ultimately chose to specialize in freestyle wrestling. He graduated from the Armenian State Institute of Physical Culture in 1957. By the end of the 1950s, Musheghian was one of the top featherweight wrestlers not only in the Soviet Union, but also in the world. In 1958 and 1959 he won the USSR Championships, became a bronze medalist at the 1957 World Wrestling Championships, and won the gold medal at the 1958 Wrestling World Cup. Musheghian was the first Armenian freestyle wrestler to win a World Championship medal and win the World Cup. At the USSR Second Spartakiad in 1959, he came in first place. However, in spite of these successes the USSR national team coaching staff did not select him to partake at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, after which Musheghian retired from wrestling. He received the Deserved master of sports of the USSR title in 1966. He was the founder of the Freestyle wrestling school of Yerevan in 1966. From 1971 to 1977 he worked in Afghanistan and Madagascar, after which he returned to coaching in Yerevan and participated in the organization of several tournaments in wrestling. Musheghian was also known in Armenia as an active public figure and founder of the \\"Zoravar Andranik\\" All-Armenian Union in 1986. He died on 23 December 2011, aged 76, in his home city of Yerevan.

Evans, son of John Evans and Janet Butterfield, was born in London 25 May 1767, and educated at Harrow School. On attaining his sixteenth year he was articled to a Warrington solicitor, in whose office he relieved the tedium of business hours by courting the muses. He was admitted an attorney in February 1789, and began to practise at Leigh, Lancashire. Soon afterwards he entered his name as a student of Gray's Inn, and in February 1794 was called to the bar, when he joined the northern circuit, took up his residence in Liverpool, and practised there for several years as a special pleader and conveyancer. On the first appointment of a stipendiary magistrate for Manchester, in 1813, Evans was offered and accepted the office. Two years later he was appointed vice- chancellor of the County Palatine of Lancaster. He held these offices concurrently until 1818, and discharged their duties with dignity and impartiality. Later career In 1817 he was unsuccessful in an application for a vacant judgeship, but two years later the recordership of Bombay, worth 7,000l. a year, was conferred on him, and at the same time he received the honour of knighthood. On the voyage out, Evans occupied himself on the composition of A Treatise upon the Civil Law, and he originated a weekly literary publication for the amusement of his fellow-voyagers. He began his duties in India with great promise of success, but in little more than fifteen months after his arrival he fell a victim to a complaint of some standing, no doubt aggravated by the climate, dying on 5 Dec. 1821, in his fifty-fifth year. He was married in 1790 to Hannah, daughter of Peter Seaman of Warrington. She survived him till 1832. There is an engraved portrait of Evans by Edward Scriven, executed shortly before his going out to Bombay.

It is a basal centrosaurine which lived during the Late Cretaceous Period (late Campanian, about 76.0-75.5 Ma). Fossils have been found in southern Utah, United States. Nasutoceratops was a large, ground-dwelling, quadrupedal herbivore with a short snout and unique rounded horns above its eyes that have been likened to those of modern cattle. Extending almost to the tip of its snout, these horns are the longest of all the members of the centrosaurine subfamily. The presence of pneumatic elements in the nasal bones of Nasutoceratops are a unique trait and are unknown in any other ceratopsid. Nasutoceratops, Diabloceratops, and Machairoceratops are the only three centrosaurine dinosaurs from the American southwest. Discovery and naming Known material of the skull in multiple views Nasutoceratops is known from the holotype UMNH VP 16800, a partially associated nearly complete skull, a coronoid process, a syncervical, three partial anterior dorsal vertebrae, a shoulder girdle, an associated left forelimb, parts of the right forelimb and skin impressions. Two specimens were referred: UMNH VP 19466, a disarticulated adult skull consisting of an incomplete premaxilla, maxilla and nasal, and UMNH VP 19469, an isolated squamosal of a subadult. The holotype was discovered and collected in 2006 during the Kaiparowits Basin Project, initiated by the University of Utah in 2000. It was recovered from channel sandstone from the middle unit of the upper Kaiparowits Formation within the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, in sediment that dates to the late Campanian stage of the Cretaceous period, approximately 75 million years ago.M.

Indiana University Press, Bloomington 478-494 It was first named and described in a thesis by its discoverer Eric Karl Lund in 2010 as Nasutuceratops titusi, remaining at first an invalid nomen ex dissertatione. Scott D. Sampson, Lund, Mark A. Loewen, Andrew A. Farke and Katherine E. Clayton validly named it in 2013, emending the generic name to Nasutoceratops. The type species is Nasutoceratops titusi. The generic name comes from nasutus in Latin meaning \\"large-nosed\\", and ceratops, \\"horned-face\\" in Greek. The specific name honors Alan L. Titus for recovering fossils of Nasutoceratops from the GSENM. Description Skeletal diagram showing known remains in white The holotype skull is approximately in length. Its body length has been estimated at , its weight at .Paul, G.S., 2016, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs 2nd edition, Princeton University Press p. 287 Nasutoceratops has several unique derived traits or autapomorphies. The part of the snout around the nostril is strongly developed, representing about three quarters of the skull length in front of the eye sockets. The rear of each nasal bone is hollowed out by a large internal cavity. The contact surface between the maxilla and the praemaxilla is exceptionally large. The maxilla also has a large internal flange contacting the praemaxilla via two horizontal facets. The brow horns at their bases are pointed forwards and outwards, then curve inwards, and ultimately twist their points upwards. full text Life restoration Nasutoceratops also shows a unique combination of traits that are in themselves not unique. The horn on the nose is low and narrow, with an elongated base. The squamosal has a high ridge on its upper surface, running from the direction of the eye socket towards the squamosal rim. The skull frill is more or less circular with its widest point at the middle edge. The osteoderms on the frill edge, the epiparietals and episquamosals, do not have the form of spikes but are shaped like simple low crescents. The rear frill edge is not notched but instead has an epiparietal on the midline. The snout of Nasutoceratops was short and high; its nasal bones exhibit internal cavities that the authors consider to represent pneumatic excavations, invading the bone from the nasal cavity. This is noteworthy because pneumatic nasals are unknown in any other ceratopsid, which supports that this feature represents a unique derived trait of this genus. Nasutoceratops had as many as 29 tooth positions in the maxilla, each occupied by several stacked teeth. The skull roof between the eye sockets is vaulted and is markedly higher than the snout region. The curved horizontally projecting brow horn arrangement was likened to that of modern cattle by paleontologist David Hone. The brow horns span approximately 40% of the total length of the skull, almost reaching the level of the snout tip, and with a bone core length of up to 457 millimetres are the longest known of any centrosaurine, both in absolute and relative terms. Skull diagram The epijugal (cheek horn) has a length of , also the largest known among centrosaurines. The skull frill is moderately long, and pierced by a large kidney-shaped parietal fenestra at each side. Apart from the midline epiparietal, there are seven epiparietals at each side, and about four to five episquamosals. In the forelimb, the ulna is exceptionally robust with a large olecranon process. Of the three patches with skin impressions found near the left shoulder, one shows a pattern of large, eight to eleven millimetres wide, hexagonal scales surrounded by smaller triangular scales. Classification Nasutoceratops was assigned to the Centrosaurinae in 2013, in a relatively basal position. A phylogenetic analysis performed by Sampson et al. (2013) found Nasutoceratops to be the sister taxon of Avaceratops. According to this study, the existence of Nasutoceratops would support the hypothesis of faunal separation between the north and south of Laramidia. Its clade would differ from the northern centrosaurines in the retention of long brow horns and a short nose horn, combined with developing, convergent with the Chasmosaurinae, low epiparietals. In 2016, this clade was named Nasutoceratopsini; it contains Nasutoceratops as well as ANSP 15800 (the holotype of Avaceratops), MOR 692 (previously treated as an adult specimen of Avaceratops), the newly-described CMN 8804 from the Oldman Formation, and another undescribed ceratopsian found in Malta, Montana. The cladogram presented below follows a phylogenetic analysis of the Centrosaurinae by Chiba et al. (2017), which included a systematic re-evaluation of Medusaceratops lokii: Ceratopsid skull casts positioned in a phylogenetic tree; Nasutoceratops is located middle left (06). Holotype skull during preparation Paleoecology Nasutoceratops (back center) with co-existing ceratopsids, deinonychosaurians and Stegoceras The only known specimen of Nasutoceratops was recovered at the Kaiparowits Formation, in southern Utah. Argon-argon radiometric dating indicates that the Kaiparowits Formation was deposited between 76.1 and 74.0 million years ago, during the Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous period.Roberts EM, Deino AL, Chan MA (2005) 40Ar/39Ar age of the Kaiparowits Formation, southern Utah, and correlation of contemporaneous Campanian strata and vertebrate faunas along the margin of the Western Interior Basin.

Miscellaneous Publication 02-4, UtahGeological Survey, 66 pp. During the Late Cretaceous period, the site of the Kaiparowits Formation was located near the western shore of the Western Interior Seaway, a large inland sea that split North America into two landmasses, Laramidia to the west and Appalachia to the east. The plateau where dinosaurs lived was an ancient floodplain dominated by large channels and abundant wetland peat swamps, ponds and lakes, and was bordered by highlands. The climate was wet and humid, and supported an abundant and diverse range of organisms.Titus, Alan L. and Mark A. Loewen (editors). At the Top of the Grand Staircase: The Late Cretaceous of Southern Utah. 2013. Indiana University Press. Hardbound: 634 pp. This formation contains one of the best and most continuous records of Late Cretaceous terrestrial life in the world. Nasutoceratops shared its paleoenvironment with theropods such as dromaeosaurids, the troodontid Talos sampsoni, ornithomimids like Ornithomimus velox, tyrannosaurids like Teratophoneus, armored ankylosaurids, the duckbilled hadrosaurs Parasaurolophus cyrtocristatus and Gryposaurus monumentensis, the ceratopsians Utahceratops gettyi and Kosmoceratops richardsoni and the oviraptorosaurian Hagryphus giganteus. Paleofauna present in the Kaiparowits Formation included chondrichthyans (sharks and rays), frogs, salamanders, turtles, lizards and crocodilians. A variety of early mammals were present including multituberculates, marsupials, and insectivorans.

An edited version of \\"Catalan\\" was released as a single, with \\"Animal Farm\\" as the B-side, but both it and the album itself failed to chart. The track \\"Gangsters\\" was used as the theme music for the BBC TV series of the same name. Having written the theme in 1974 for a one-off programme ‚ÄúGangsters‚Äù, in 1976 Dave Greenslade wrote lyrics for the tune. This version was recorded by Chris Farlowe and was used for the last series in 1978. The track was included, as a bonus track, on the CD re-issue of Dave Greenslade's solo Cactus Choir album. Cover art Andrew McCulloch, who was at the time reading a science fiction novel with cover art by Patrick Woodroffe, suggested that he be brought on to do the art for Time and Tide. Background and recording Time and Tide saw the revival of the Dave Greenslade-Dave Lawson songwriting partnership which had been dormant during Spyglass Guest. With few exceptions, Dave Greenslade wrote the music first and Dave Lawson then added lyrics. The song \\"Catalan\\" was named in honor of a fondly remembered concert Greenslade had in the Catalonia region of Spain. The bulk of the album was recorded in Studio Three of Morgan Studios, already famed as the place where Yes recorded Tales from Topographic Oceans, while the vocals for \\"Time\\" were recorded at Sawmills Studios. Sawmills Studios was used for this track because Dave Greenslade was an enthusiast of local choir The Treverva Male Voice Choir and wanted to record with them. Recording took place from 3 to 23 February 1975, with mixing beginning on 28 February. The album was produced by the band with engineers Gregg Jackman and Jeremy Ensor, both of whom had also worked on Spyglass Guest, though Jackman was not credited as a producer on Spyglass Guest.

He is best known for winning the 2004 King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. Background Doyen is a tall, rangy bay horse with a large white star, bred at the Kildangan Stud in Ireland by his owner Sheikh Mohammed and raised at the Dalham Hall Stud at Newmarket. He was sired by Sadler's Wells out of the mare Moon Cactus, making him a full brother to the Oaks winner Moonshell. Racing career =2002: two-year-old season= Doyen was originally sent into training with Andr√© Fabre in France. He was not a precocious colt and did not appear on a racecourse until the autumn of 2002, when he ran fifth in a minor event for unraced horses at Maisons-Laffitte. =2003: three-year-old season= At three, Doyen proved himself to be a top-class middle-distance performer in a campaign which saw him moved up in grade with each race. After capturing a minor race at Saint- Cloud, he won the Listed Coupe des Trois Ans at Lyon-Parilly \\"easily\\" by two lengths. Moved up to Group Race standard for the first time in June 2004, he outpaced his opponents to record a four length win in the Prix du Lys at Longchamp. On Doyen's next start he ran in the Prix Niel at Longchamp in September. As usual the race attracted a top-class field, including the Prix du Jockey-Club winner, Dalakhani and The Derby winner, Kris Kin. Doyen raced in last place in the early stages, before moving into contention in the straight. He was the horse to seriously challenge Dalakhani, finishing a length and a half behind the Aga Khan's colt, with Kris Kin well beaten in third. On his final start of the year he was made 11-2 third favourite for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. He raced prominently, before being moved wide to make a challenge in the straight, but although he stayed on well he was unable to reach the lead, and finished fourth to Dalakhani. =2004: four-year-old season= In the winter of 2003/4 Doyen was transferred from France to the Sheikh's Godolphin stable. On his debut for Saeed bin Suroor he ran second to Warrsan in the Coronation Cup at Epsom. He was then sent to Royal Ascot for the Hardwicke Stakes, where he produced his best performance to date, taking the lead in the straight and pulling clear to win by six lengths in a course record time of 2:26.53. Frankie Dettori, riding the colt for the fifth time was enthusiastic- \\"What a performance ‚Äì he just took my breath away,\\". So impressive was Doyen's victory that he was made clear favourite for the following month's King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes over the same course and distance, and he was even blamed for the absence of top-class three-year-olds in the race. On the day, he fully justified his reputation, winning by an easy three lengths in a style described The Independent's correspondent as \\" simply magnificent\\". Dettori praised the colt saying, \\"I have never had a horse travel like he did today...he was absolutely devastating\\". The King George win could have been the first of many Group One successes, and Sheikh Mohammed missed seeing his colt Rule of Law win the St Leger in order to watch Doyen run in the Irish Champion Stakes. He started odds-on favourite but ran poorly, failing to produce his usual acceleration and finishing seventh. The Champion Stakes saw a similar disappointment, with Doyen again starting favourite but finishing well beaten behind Haafhd. Three more unplaced efforts in 2005 saw him retired to stud. Assessment In the 2004 World Thoroughbred Racehorse Rankings Doyen was awarded a figure of 127, making him the third best racehorse in the world, the highest-rated European and the highest-rated turf performer. Stud career Doyen was retired to stand at his owner's Dalham Hall Stud at Newmarket. In 2009 he was transferred to Gest√ºt Auenquelle in Germany. To date the best of his progeny have been Lady's Purse (Prix de Royaumont) and Sneek A Peek (Premio Federico Tesio). He has since been transferred to Sunnyhill Stud, County Kildare, Ireland.

Background  With the death of Balthasar Oomkens von Esens in 1540, the Attena line of East Frisian chieftains ruling Harlingerland died out and the Harlingerland fell to the Counts of Rietberg, who were related to the Attenas. From 1540, Harlingerland was ruled by Count John II of Rietberg, the son of Balthasar's sister. After his death, the Harlingerland went to his second daughter, Walburgis. She married in 1581 Count Enno III of East Frisia. They had two daughters, who, by the Treaty of Berum, waived their right to inherit Harlingerland, in favour of Enno's son Rudolf Christian, from his first marriage.  Contents  Sabine Catharine and her sister Agnes sold the Lordships of Esens, Stedesdorf and Wittmund and thus the entire Harlingerland, to their father, for . The payment was later increased to . Sabina Catherine, the elder sister, would inherit the county of Rietberg.

Aftermath  In 1622 Ernst von Mansfeld stole the , packed in barrels, which Enno III had prepared as payment for Agnes and her husband Prince Gundakar of Liechtenstein. So the payment could not be made then. In 1663, demands for payment were renewed.

He had a 60-year career in the tennis business, first as an amateur and professional tennis player, including a period as the number one ranked player in Great Britain and a member of the British Davis Cup team, then as an entrepreneur and one of the pioneers of the professional game.  Playing career  Davies was born in Swansea, Wales. He took up tennis at the age of 11, and was discovered by Fred Perry and Dan Maskell. He played on the British Davis Cup team with Bobby Wilson, Billy Knight and Roger Becker. In 1952 Davies went to Australia for the first of three winter visits to work with Harry Hopman, the Australian Davis Cup Coach, and Australian players like Lew Hoad, Ken Rosewall, Roy Emerson, Fred Stolle. It was there that Davies developed his game. From 1958 to 1960 Davies was ranked number 1 in Great Britain. He played on the Davis Cup team for Great Britain from 1956 to 1960 and had a 15/8 match record. In 1960 he reached the final of the Men's Doubles at Wimbledon with Bobby Wilson; the last time a British male reached the final of Wimbledon's Men's Singles or Men's Doubles until 2012. After that doubles final, in 1960, he was invited to turn professional with Jack Kramer for a two-year guarantee of ¬£4,500-a-year. He joined a select group of players considered to be the best in the world such as Pancho Gonzales, Tony Trabert, Lew Hoad, Ken Rosewall and Pancho Segura. Since international tennis at this time was an amateur sport, Davies' professional status put him at odds with the ruling tennis body, the International Tennis Federation (ITF), and his membership of the All-England Club at Wimbledon was cancelled, and he became ineligible to ever play Davis Cup or any of the Grand Slams again. As well as playing he was elected to the board of the first Players' Association that was formed by this select group of approximately 12‚Äì15 players and found himself leading the charge to promote professional tennis and to fight for open tennis. Soon Davies found himself doubling up as the tour's spokesman and selling the upcoming events and taking the first steps towards a flourishing career in the promotion of tennis as a business. This first Players Association (IPTPA) was the forerunner of what is now the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), of which Davies was to become executive director in 1982. In 1961 Davies published two books: one a teaching book, and the other a biography called Tennis Rebel (Stanley Paul, London). Davies retired in 1967, one year before Wimbledon finally allowed professionals to play. However, he did come out of retirement to play in the first Open at Wimbledon. He had missed 28 Grand Slam events during the ban.

Davies, D.Hardwick, J. Connors) In 1967 Lamar Hunt co-founded World Championship Tennis (WCT) with his nephew, Al G. Hill Jr. and, in 1968, they hired Davies as the executive director with the task of building WCT into a major force. They had eight contracted players and promoted them as The Handsome Eight: Dennis Ralston, Butch Buchholz, Pierre Barthes, John Newcombe, Tony Roche, Nikki Pilic, Roger Taylor and Cliff Drysdale. WCT guaranteed each a certain amount of money for a certain number of weeks of play each year. After a couple of years WCT bought the contracts of the other professional players at the time, including Rod Laver, Ken Rosewall, Roy Emerson, Andr√©s Gimeno and signed former amateurs Arthur Ashe and Stan Smith to professional contracts. In 1970 Davies put together the plans for the first million-dollar tour: twenty tournaments throughout the world, played in twenty cities, 32 players under contract, each receiving $50,000. The eight with the best record would qualify for the WCT finals in Dallas. Davies ran the Dallas-based WCT as executive director for thirteen years. During his time with WCT Davies was responsible for the following innovations and rule changes in the game: * first professional circuit to incorporate the tie-breaker * first to insist on coloured clothing on the players * introduction of a coloured tennis ball (first orange, then yellow) in 1972 * Davies created the 30 seconds between points and the 90 seconds between games * first to place chairs on the court for the players during change-overs * first to have a player representative and a trainer travel with the players to each tournament * overrule by the umpire and experimented with electronic line calling in 1972 * first to complete a television deal with a major network (NBC) for its World Championship of Tennis Series, culminating in the Dallas finals * first to syndicate tournaments in the US * first to sign a contract (with ESPN) before the network ever came on the air =ATP= In 1981 Davies left WCT after 13 years and joined his lifelong friend Butch Buchholz as Marketing Director of the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP). One year later, when Buchholz left the ATP, Davies took over as executive director. The ATP was almost bankrupt at the time, and when Davies left after three years they had over $1 million in assets. He helped consolidate the players' pension plan and created more jobs for players with bigger draws and more tournaments and bigger prize money. = MITPC = Davies also served on the Men's Pro Council and was chairman of this committee which administered the Men's Professional Circuit, before the ATP. =ITF= In 1987 Davies joined the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and later moved back to London as general manager and Marketing Director. He was made a full member of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club at Wimbledon in 1990 ‚Äì 30 years after they had withdrawn his membership. During these years Davies almost tripled the Sponsorship and International Television revenue for the ITF, and created the Grand Slam Committee which now oversees the four Grand Slam events =Grand Slam Cup= Davies also created the Grand Slam Cup which was first played in Munich Germany in 1990. This event was for the 16 players who had the best record in the four Grand Slam events. The prize money was $6 million, with $2 million going to the winner of the event. Still the highest prize money per player ever. In 1994 Davies negotiated the largest tennis Television contract which was between German TV, the German Tennis Federation and the ITF for a five-year deal for $200 million. Retirement and death Davies retired in 1995 and moved back to the United States.

It was shortlisted for the Booker Prize. It is set on a South African farm during apartheid. Plot summary Martin, the narrator, a rich South African businessman, recalls the events of a weekend which settled the future of his family farm: he wants to sell it although he has promised his father on his death-bed that he will never do so, and although his brother wants to take it over. So he visits the farm for a weekend to tell his mother she will be \\"evicted\\". For the trip, he calls off a meeting with his lover Bea, who leaves him for that because she wanted to tell him that she is pregnant. It is a long drive to the farm and he does not often go there. He takes his son Louis along to get closer to him. Louis, an army veteran who served in Angola during Operation Savannah, is traumatized and silent since his return to civilian life. The imagined good talk between them makes matters worse, though - the father begins by asking his son casually about his \\"trip to Angola\\", and when Louis finally opens up and talks about the atrocities of the war, they end up arguing about politics. The farm is extremely drought-stricken, and Martin's mother has invited a water diviner to look for an underground stream. Martin thinks this is ridiculous. When he then visits the family graveyard for one last time, loses his glasses, so that from then on the egocentric man is in every sense of the word \\"blind\\" to the events happening around him. At night, a black worker murders his wife and is taken to prison, leaving a baby and older children behind. This is regarded by the whites as \\"typical\\" tribal behavior and helps Martin to underline his opinion that his mother should not run the farm on her own because it is too dangerous - although the real reason is that he will get a good price for the farm. The visit of a few neighbours, who are also farmers, shows that most people in the area are selling their land, which is regarded by those who stay on their family farms as treason. When Martin ‚Äì still almost blind without his glasses ‚Äì gets lost in the jungle on a short walk, almost not making it back to the farm where he was born and raised; he does not belong here. Father and son drive home. The farm will be sold and Martin's mother will live with their family although she and Martin's wife do not get along. Louis gets an ultimatum to find a job, after which he disappears and never comes back.

Because its component tree species produce abundant nectar and pollen throughout the year, it is important for the conservation of many species of birds and other animals. History Because box‚Äìironbark forest lies mainly within the Goldfields region of Victoria, during the main years of the gold rush (1851-1870) it underwent intensive digging and clearing in the goldfields, accompanied by extensive timber cutting for infrastructure and firewood in surrounding areas. After the gold rush subsided the forests were still heavily cut for firewood and cleared for pasture. Description The extent of Box- Ironbark Forest in 2001 (source: Environment Conservation Council) Box‚Äìironbark forest is found on rocky, often auriferous (gold-bearing), soils, in flat and undulating landscapes at altitudes of 150‚Äì600 m above sea level, and with an average annual rainfall of 500‚Äì800 mm. About 40% of the area formerly supporting the ecosystem in Victoria is public land with less than 20% protected in conservation reserves. About 55% has been permanently cleared for agriculture, mining and urban development. Remaining forest has been fragmented. =Vegetation= Box‚Äìironbark forest is characterised by a canopy of box, ironbark and gum-barked eucalypts, growing to 25 m in height, over a sparse understorey of wattles, small-leaved and prostrate shrubs, herbs and grasses. The main trees are white box, red box, red ironbark, mugga ironbark, yellow gum and red stringybark. In some areas they may grow with, or be replaced by, yellow box, long-leaf box or silver bundy. The mix of plants in the groundcover includes the largest concentrations of orchids of any Victorian ecosystem. Small herbs and shrubs most abundant in, or largely restricted to, box‚Äìironbark forests include Cheiranthera cyanaea, Philotheca verrucosa, Xerochrysum viscosum, Pultenaea largiflorens, Acacia williamsonii and Stuartina muelleri. =Animals= Because the trees of the box‚Äìironbark forest are such prolific flowerers and nectar producers, they are a major source of nectar and pollen for honeyeaters, lorikeets and many kinds of invertebrates. Flowering of the different species of eucalypts takes place at different times of year so there is always a nectar or pollen source available for migratory, nomadic and resident birds. Consequently, there are both more species, and greater numbers of individuals, of honeyeaters and lorikeets than in any other ecosystem. Nectar and pollen feeding birds such as the black- chinned, regent, fuscous and brown-headed honeyeaters, Swift parrots and musk lorikeets are all more abundant in box‚Äìironbark forests than elsewhere. The ecosystem supports the largest numbers of eastern grey kangaroos in Victoria and is a stronghold for brush-tailed phascogales, yellow-footed antechinuses and squirrel gliders.

In Westminster Hall at the Chapel of St Mary Undercroft (the Crypt Chapel), Cole was notified by a visitor about a smoking black bag on the lower steps leading up from the Chapel into Westminster Hall. Upon examination, he realized it contained dynamite and a lighted fuse. He rushed up the steps with it into Westminster Hall, intending to deposit the device in New Palace Yard. But before he could reach the door, a hot substance from the bag scalded his hand, causing him to drop it, and as he did so it exploded. He and a colleague, P.C. Cox, were thrown into the large crater torn into the floor of the Hall. Seconds later, another device exploded in the empty chamber of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, causing extensive damage, and a third at the Tower of London. All the bombings were committed by the terrorist group known as the Fenians, the precursors to the Irish Republican Army, nationalists battling British rule in Ireland. Unconscious and badly injured, Cole and his colleague were taken to hospital, where they were visited by the Home Secretary, Sir William Harcourt. Cole's actions had saved the lives of bystanders. Harcourt recognised Cole's gallantry in \\"knowing full well the terrible risk he incurred\\", and sought the Queen's approval for him to receive the Albert Medal.

During her senior year she worked at The New York Times as an intern reporter for 10 months, gaining experience in journalism and her first taste of sexism within the news field: while applying for positions at the Times, she was not hired as a \\"copy girl\\" by a male employee because it would \\"cause a revolution in the newsroom\\". Upon graduation, she worked as a reporter, copy editor and bureau chief at the Newark Evening News from 1961‚Äì1964. She then went on to serve as a reporter, copy editor and assistant women's editor at Newsday, also serving as a feature writer for the publication's weekend magazine until 1969. Feminism > Until that time I had always felt like a weirdo, the only person who felt > out of step with the world around her. I knew we needed a women's movement. > This is what I had been waiting for. ‚Äì Dolores Alexander, 2007. In 1966, while working at Newsday, Alexander came across a press release announcing the creation of a new women's rights organization: the National Organization for Women (NOW). She interviewed Betty Friedan and with her media experience, she became chair of the Monitor Subcommittee of the National Task Force on Image of Women in Mass Media. In 1969 she became the first Executive Director of NOW. She established the headquarters in New York City, and served as an editor of NOW's national newsletter, NOW Acts. She offered to pay the $5 dues for women who could not afford to become members, and fronted a campaign to boost membership nationwide. In May 1970, she resigned as director to protest NOW's allegedly homophobic practices and policies. Even in her later years, she continued to be disgruntled by the negativity that the words \\"lesbian\\" and \\"feminist\\" had within the early organization, believing the terms were being used like weapons' to undercut NOW members\\". Alexander continued to lecture about women's rights and worked with the New Feminist Talent Collective, which was formed by Jacqueline Ceballos to provide the services of speakers about the women's movement. She co-founded and organized Women Against Pornography and worked with the New York Radical Feminists. Alexander served as board member for the National Association for Repeal of Abortion Laws, an advisory board member for the New York NOW chapter and was a member of the New York Newspaper Women's Club. Alexander was a notable figure in numerous events in the women's movement. She helped end the practice of gender-segregated want ads in The New York Times, was witness to the lesbian purge of the National Organization for Women, participated in 1977's National Women's Conference in Houston, and the UN's Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995. =Mother Courage= Mother Courage manager Joyce Vinson, co-founders Jill Ward and Dolores Alexander, and co-manager Rosemary Gaffney, celebrate the restaurant's 3rd anniversary On May 1972, Alexander and Jill Ward opened Mother Courage, the first feminist restaurant in the United States in Greenwich Village, New York.Mother Courage Press Kit, 1975. Box 15, Dolores Alexander Papers. Sophia Smith Collection, Smith College. Retrieved March 6, 2020. Located on 342 West 11th Street, the restaurant was named after the heroic female protagonist, Mother Courage, from Bertolt Brecht's eponymous drama. Since the two women had no prior restaurant experience, they borrowed money from several feminist friends and colleagues to renovate an old luncheonette called Benny's Soda Luncheonette and Delicatessen. With the help of many friends and Ward's father, Alexander and Ward completely remodeled the location and turned it into an entirely new restaurant. Every night for the first couple of weeks of Mother Courage's opening, Ward and Alexander explained their restaurant was at near capacity for dinner. They explained in their press release that, \\"...Mother Courage had become the hangout and gathering place of feminists around the city. Women felt comfortable coming in for dinner alone, certain they would run into at least one other person they knew and could dine with.\\" This comfort was due to the fact that while the restaurant was technically co-ed, women took priority. After Mother Courage was granted their beer and wine license in 1973, Joyce Vinson (one of the later managers of the restaurant), explained that as a feminist, she would only give the first sip of wine to women even if accompanied by male guests. Checks were also placed within equal distance of diners in order to not make any assumptions about who was going to pay for the meal. Diners, however, weren't the only people to experience this feminist set of ethics. Mother Courage made sure to pay each worker the same salary and had each position rotate amongst staff so that, \\"every woman [had] an appreciation of the problems of every other woman.\\" On May 19, 1975, Mother Courage celebrated its third birthday by hosting a champagne buffet with a cake in the shape of the venus symbol.Third Birthday Party Photo, May 19, 1975. Box 15, Dolores Alexander Papers. Sophia Smith Collection, Smith College. Retrieved March 6, 2020. Over 100 guests were invited (many of whom are famous feminists), including Gloria Steinem, Audre Lorde, Kate Millett, and more. Even though Mother Courage was only open until 1977, it inspired many other feminist restaurants to open up around the country.Mary Dorman's (Ward and Alexander's lawyer) Letter of Sale, June 1977.

So Gong Shi means the Emperor's purchasing. was a policy in ancient China during the period of Emperor Dezong () and Emperor Shunzong () of the Tang dynasty in which the emperor would send eunuchs to civilian markets to purchase goods by force at very low prices. This system was abolished by Reformists led by Wang Shuwen () under the rule of Emperor Shunzong.  History  Researches published by City University of Hong Kong and Fudan University show that the earliest record of Gong Shi can be traced back to 707, according to two biographic sketches of Emperor Zhongzong (). At first, the Gong Shi was merely certain kind of imperial entertainment, until the period of the Emperor Xuanzong (), when the entertainment tended to become a commercial practice adopted to serve the need of the palace. Before the Zhenyuan () period of the reign of Emperor Dezong, if the palace required supplies, then the officials responsible for procurement would settle the bill immediately after a purchase. Originally these officials were called The Envoy of Imperial purchasing (), but later they were renamed the Envoy of Emperor's purchasing (). At that time, the purchase and management of charcoal, which was the main fuel for the imperial household, was part of the daily operations of the whole palace in the Tang dynasty. Various officials were appointed to act as The Envoy of Charcoal Purchasing (). At first, the eunuchs were simply The Envoys of Emperor's purchasing, whose responsibility did not include buying charcoal, but this changed as the eunuchs' power increased during a period which saw power struggles among the officials of court, and the role of The Envoy of Charcoal Purchasing slowly merged with their existing duties. Charcoal was only one commodity among many that were plundered by the government using the Gong Shi practice. Because of this, the imperial family started sending eunuchs to make purchases towards the end of the Zhenyuan period and the practice of purchasing goods at low prices began to develop, and even the official documents needed to permit and justify such purchases gradually vanished. Although the Expostulatory Officials () often suggested that Emperor Dezong should abolish Gong Shi, he did not do so.  Implementation  The implementation of Gong Shi basically involved shops operated by eunuchs within the palace. Taking advantage of imperial power to bully the citizens, these eunuchs would often send men to markets located at both the east and west part of the city, or the main road which was the only way people could pass to arrive at their destination, to enforce the deals. The traders received extremely poor payments and were subsequently ordered to transport their merchandise to the palace. At the time, there could hundreds of people buying goods at low prices by force at various markets in the capital city Chang'an () - often a few hundred Qian () were used to purchase goods worth thousands, or, in some cases, there might be no payment at all. The civilian traders dared not resist or even ask where these officials were from, even though there were often doubts as to the identities of the purchasers. The Chronicle of Shunzong period () written by Han Yu () recorded such an incident: while a peasant was going to the town carrying firewood he wanted to sell in the market, he met a eunuch claiming the firewood had already been bought by the emperor (through the Gong Shi system) and simply paying him a few chi of juan (), a type of silk product. The eunuch then ordered the peasant to transport the firewood to the imperial palace using his donkey and even asked for an Entrance tip (). All these demands upset the peasant; he gave the juan back and begged for mercy, but the eunuch insisted that he transport the firewood. In the end, the peasant assaulted the eunuch out of frustration and was arrested by a patrolling officer. Hearing of this event, Emperor Dezong dismissed the eunuch responsible by sending out an imperial decree and presented ten pieces of juan to the peasant. Although historical documents recording such events in detail can hardly be found today, scholastic researches generally used the terms rob (), seize (), pillage () or take by force () in Chinese to describe the eunuchs' misdeeds negatively.  Abolition  Shortly after his accession, Emperor Shunzong began to reappoint the Reformists, the leader of whom was Wang Shuwen. The Reformists implemented a series of policies, including the abolition of Gong Shi and the Scoundrels in the Five Workshops (:zh:‰∫îÂùäÂ∞èÂÖí, ), which acted as tools to oppress the civilian population.  Criticism  Sinologist Chen Yinke said \\"Gong Shi was the worst policy in the late Emperor Dezong period\\" in his book the Draft of Album Verses of Yuanbai (). Han Yu wrote in the Chronicle of Shunzong period: \\"although called Gong Shi, it was actually a robbery.\\" Modern Chinese scholar Zhang Lifan said in an essay: \\"during his early years, Emperor Dezong knew it was wiser to be thrifty. But when grew older, he became more and more avaricious and wasteful. At the same time, the extent of civilians' sufferings from Gong Shi largely increased.\\"  Literature  In the poem the Old Charcoal Seller (), the famous ancient Chinese poet Bai Juyi () satirized the phenomenon of officials buying goods by force at low prices by Gong Shi, with a note below the title of the poem: \\"so suffering from the Gong Shi\\" (). = Related works = *Bai Juyi, the Old Charcoal Seller *Han Yu, the Chronicle of Shunzong period  See also  *The Scoundrels in the Five Workshops (:zh:‰∫îÂùäÂ∞èÂÖí), an offensive word once used to describe workers in the five imperial workshops.

Twelve threatened species live within the reef: 10 fish species, the green turtle, and the spinner dolphin. All of this marine life has traditionally supported the native population, and currently some 70,000 people depend on the reef. After seeing fish populations decline in recent decades, local leaders created a series of marine protected areas in 2005 where fishing is prohibited. Traditional customs used to manage the reef for hundreds of years permit leaders to set aside portions of the qoliqoli, or traditional fishing ground. Where the ban has been enforced, fish populations are rebounding and spilling over into areas where fishing is permitted.

In many German-speaking territories, for example the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg, the duty of municipalities to provide this service was imposed by law in the first half of the 19th century.

It began to be built in 1936 on the initiative of Octavio Moura Andrade, who intended to bring help to build a hotel, and subsequently tourists to what would later become the Grande Hotel in the city of √Åguas de S√£o Pedro. On 28 July 1940, the first great flight to S√£o Pedro, organized by Octavio Moura Andrade to pay homage to his brother Antonio Joaquim de Moura Andrade, had occurred. Seventy-eight aircraft from flying clubs of the state of S√£o Paulo, and Brazilian Army aircraft from the Campo de Marte Airport and Santos Naval Air Base attended the celebration. The second great flight to S√£o Pedro have been held in the airfield from 19 to 21 April 1947, with the intention of gathering aviators from Brazil to create the Uni√£o Brasileira de Aviadores Civis (Brazilian Union of Civil Aviators).

Auer. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Sound Recording (Charles L. Lootens). Plot The former naval lieutenant Chris Waring is awakened by the police late time and delivered to Admiral Curtiss, his former commander. The admiral asks Waring for his support in an undercover operation. The op is about the shipowner Arnold Debrock, who sold ships to the United States but later got manipulated by enemy powers in a mysterious way. Since Curtiss knows that Chris is successful with women, he asks him to flirt with Debrocks's wife Valerie Avancen. Chris initially refuses to participate, but he changes his opinion in a short while after seeing Valerie boarding a ship to Havana and takes up the pursuit of the beautiful woman. He actually succeeds in flirting viciously with Valerie and to get her to go with him to his cabin. There, however, they both meet, for Chris's great surprise, Joan Millard, the Admiral Curtiss's secretary. Asked by Valerie, Joan introduces herself as Chris's wife, and Valerie also reveals her identity and says that she left her husband. Joan tells speechless Chris that Curtiss has sent her to support him. The couple has to begin with their investigations against its will. Some time later, the ship finds a man in the sea, Capt. Jonathan Hunt. He tells Chris that he worked at the Debrock shipping company and that his crew mutinied against him after he refused to comply with Debrock's order to moor +in a foreign port. He was then deprived of his position. Capt. Brigham, however, believes that Hunt has fallen victim to the sea. After the ship reaches Havana, Chris and Joan try to get more information from Valerie. Brigham is attacked by Debrock, who is angry that Hunt, as everyone believes, has been sent to certain death. However, Hunt holds back allegations since measures have been taken to prevent him from talking about the incident. Shortly thereafter, Debrock tries to convince Valerie that he will soon leave the business to retreat to private life together with her. Valerie, however, tells her husband that she does not love him anymore. These words affect him very much, and he tries to shoot Chris but misses. Meanwhile, Chris learns that Carlos Castillo-Martinez, whom he regarded as a craftsman, actually belongs to the Cuban military secret service and is also involved in the investigation against Debrock. Chris, Joan, Carlos, and Hunt attend a farewell dinner. Debrock sees Hunt and feels deeply insecure as he thinks that Hunt may expose him and prevent further orders to deploy his ships in enemy ports. Carlos arrests all those involved in Debrock's affair, while Chris compels Debrock to order his ships to go to American ports. When trying to get to Chris' weapon, Debrock falls out of the window during the fight between the two. After the case is solved, Chris and Joan want to marry as soon as possible. Cast * J.

Four years later he negotiated an agreement with Mathis which led to the creation of the Matford joint project in 1934 in order to enable Ford to grow its French business at a time of increased protectionism and at an acceptable cost. When the Matford partnership fell apart it was Dollfus who created Ford‚Äôs new plant at Poissy which was ready to produce cars in 1940 and which allowed the company an impressive annual production capacity (that would never be reached while Ford owned the plant) of 100,000 cars. Like many industrialists Dollfus was arrested in September 1944, suspected of collaboration in the fevered period of retribution that directly followed the Liberation, and he was transferred to Drancy (where he met Sacha Guitry). However he was quickly released and in 1945 received from the Americans an award reserved for companies that had contributed to the allied victory. After 1945 he continued to lead Ford in France, obtaining from the Americans a ready developed new model that became the future Ford Vedette.

Life  Silver was born in Bradford, Yorkshire, England in 1949, of German Jewish descent. He was a pupil at Bradford Grammar School where he at first did not shine academically but enjoyed working on the school's magazine. His interest in David Hockney's talent as an artist began to blossom and, after they met at Silver's father's burger bar, Hockney agreed to design a cover for the school magazine. Silver then went on to study Art History and Textiles at Leeds University. As a young man Silver exhibited entrepreneurial skills and spent his school lunch breaks at the local auction rooms buying and selling furniture. By 1979 he had 13 menswear shops across the country as well as a clothing factory, Noble Crest, and a shop called Art and Furniture in Manchester. In 1979 he sold his Jonathan Silver chain to the John Michael Group, and sold or closed most of his other businesses, and went into partnership with his friend and supplier Sir Ernest Hall.  Dean Clough In 1983 Hall and Silver bought Dean Clough, a huge former carpet factory in Halifax, West Yorkshire, and began to regenerate it. They contributed equal shares; but the two men had very different business styles, and Hall bought Silver out the next year. According to Hall, Silver's main contribution at Dean Clough was opening and running a very successful bar called Crossley's, but Silver felt that he had contributed very much more than this. Although they did not continue to work together, Hall and Silver remained close friends. Prior to buying Dean Clough Hall and Silver bought C&J; Hursts in Huddersfield. Salt's Mill Having left Dean Clough, and with the proceeds in his pocket, Silver travelled the world with his wife, Maggie, and two young daughters. Once they returned to England, Silver, looking for a new challenge, bought Salts Mill in 1987. The mill was in a dilapidated state but Silver could see the building's potential, and transformed it into retail and commercial units and an art gallery. Salts Mill, Saltaire One of the first events that took place in Salt's Mill after Silver bought it was some performances by IOU Theatre during the first Bradford Festival. Silver was running the bar during this event, and had the idea then of creating a gallery devoted to David Hockney. He went on to create the 1853 gallery, participating himself in the building work. There have been many theatrical and musical performances since, in various parts of the mill, with Northern Broadsides in particular making Salt's Mill one of their touring venues. The mill has also housed a number of shops, run by Salt's and by independent operators; and several businesses, most notably Pace plc. The work done by Jonathan Silver in bringing Salts Mill back to life must have played a large part in Saltaire village becoming a UNESCO World Heritage Site in December 2001.

The boy learnt to read, write, and cipher as he best could, applying himself particularly to the study of arithmetic, from which he proceeded to the investigation of mathematical theorems. After the day's toil in the workshop he would hoist himself by a rope into the loft over his father's cottage, in order to pursue his studies uninterruptedly. Having worked through Euclid he set up as a schoolmaster at the age of thirty, and acquired considerable reputation as a teacher of mathematics. He married early. His wife, like his parents, discouraged the pursuit of learning as an unprofitable thing. Turning his attention to botany, Fletcher studied the properties rather than the classification of plants; increased his income by the sale of herbal decoctions, and was known to his neighbours as 'Doctor Fletcher.'

Early life Kaveh born on 22 May 1961 in Mashhad. His father was a religious businessman in Mashhad during the Shah's regime. His father was connected with Ali Khamenei and Abdolkarim Hasheminejad. He emphasised the importance of bringing up his son religiously and would take him to pray in the mosque and participate in religious gatherings. Alongside studying in high school, he started studying religious sciences in Mashhad Hawza. =1979 revolution= With the rise of anti-regime activities, Kaveh, who was an active religious youth, would attend the speeches of Ali Khamenei in the Imam Hassan Mojtaba and Javad ul-A'imeh mosques which were central places for anti- regime activities. He tried a lot to change the minds of his classmates and show them the oppression committed by the Shah's regime. He actively distributed Ruhollah Khomeini's flyers and participated in all anti-regime protests. After revolution of 1979 After Islamic revolution, Kaveh was one of the first people to join the IRGC from Mashhad. He underwent training for six months. After this, he was dispatched to Tehran as one of Ruhollah Khomeini's personal guards. =Iran‚ÄìIraq War= Kaveh was 19 when Iran‚ÄìIraq War was started. He was dispatched to the southern war zones, but due to a lack of military training, he was sent back to Mashhad and underwent intensive training. It was difficult for him not to attend the war, so he decided to go to the Kurdistan Province to quell the anti-revolutionary spirit in the province. Soon, due to his competence and courage, he was appointed as the operation commander of the IRGC in Saqqez. =155th Shohada Special Forces Brigade= When the 155th Shohada Special Forces Brigade was established, Kaveh was appointed as its operation commander. In a short time, he managed to liberate many different regions that were previously occupied by the anti- revolutionary forces.

R. Robertson, Necrology of G. Wyszecki, AIC Newsletter No. 3, Aug. 1986, 18‚Äì20 G√ºnter Wyszecki Education Wyszecki was born in Tilsit, East Prussia, Germany (today Sovetsk, Russia). He attended the Technische Universit√§t Berlin where he was awarded a Dr.-Ing. degree, with a dissertation on normal and anomalous trichromacy.G. Wyszecki, Valenzmetrische Untersuchung des Zusammenhanges zwischen normaler und anomaler Trichromasie, Farbe 2 (1953) 39-45 In 1953 he was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship and for a year joined Deane B. Judd at the Colorimetry and Photometry section of the U. S. National Bureau of Standards in Washington DC. Career In 1955 Wyszecki joined the National Research Council of Canada in Ottawa where he became the leader of its Optics Section in 1960 and Assistant Director of the Division of Physics in 1982, and where he remained until his untimely death from leukemia. Wyszecki is best known for his scientific contributions to and leadership in the International Commission on Illumination (CIE). He was chairman of its Colorimetry Committee from 1963 to 1975, vice president of the organization from 1979 to 1983 and its president from 1983 until his death. During this period the CIE made many important recommendations in colorimetry, remaining valid today, such as 1 nm tables of the color-matching functions of the two CIE standard observers and the standard illuminants A and D65, addition of integrating-sphere reflectance factor measurement as a recommended measuring geometry, the 1964 (U*V*W*) and the 1976 CIELAB and CIELUV uniform color space and color difference formulas, and others. Metamerism: Wyszecki introduced the important concept of ‚Äòmetameric blacks,‚Äô psychophysical definitions of blacks with tristimulus values 0, 0, 0 that within limits can be added to a spectral reflectance to form the various possible metamers (with an identical set of tristimulus values) under a given light.G. Wyszecki, Evaluation of metameric colors, Journal of the Optical Society of America 48 (1958) 451‚Äì454 With W.S. Stiles he also developed mathematical methods to calculate by various methodologies the number of possible metamers for given chromaticities, peaking at the achromatic colors.W.S. Stiles and G. Wyszecki, Counting metameric object colors, Journal of the Optical Society of America 52 (1962) 313‚Äì319 Wyszecki seven-field colorimeter: In 1965 Wyszecki developed the seven-field colorimeter with which an observer can view with both eyes one or more of seven hexagonal fields, each with separately controllable RGB sources achieved with filtered light, mixed in an integrating sphere. Color matching and color- difference matching: The MacAdam color-matching error ellipses of 1942 (1 observer) were extended in 1957 for 12 observers by Brown and in 1971 by Wyszecki and Fielder.G. Wyszecki and G.H. Fielder, New color-matching ellipses, Journal of the Optical Society of America 61 (1971) 1135‚Äì1152 The latter two investigations demonstrated the considerable variability by observer. The seven-field colorimeter was also used for a novel color- difference matching experiment in which three fields were displayed and the observer had to adjust the third field so that its brightness matched the brightness of preselected colors with equal luminance in two fields and its chromaticity resulted in identical perceived differences between the colors in the triangular arrangement.G. Wyszecki and G.H. Fielder, Color-difference matches, Journal of the Optical Society of America 61 (1971) 1501‚Äì1513 Heterochromatic brightness matching: Wyszecki and co-workers also added important experimental data to the luminance of equally bright stimuli. Many chromatic stimuli, when compared to achromatic ones of the same psychophysical brightness or lightness appear to be lighter or brighter, to be \\"glowing,\\" an effect known as the Helmholtz‚ÄìKohlrausch effect.G. Wyszecki, Correlate for brightness in terms of CIE chromaticity coordinates and luminous reflectance, Journal of the Optical Society of America 57 (1967) 254‚Äì257 Publications Wyszecki authored or co-authored 86 scientific papers and 3 books. The first book, Farbsysteme was published in Germany in 1960,G. Wyszecki, Farbsysteme, G√∂ttingen: Musterschmidt Verlag, 1960 describing color order systems. He co- authored together with D. B.

Shortly, Fred (Roland on the ropes for Amstrad), by others authors, this time under the company Made in Spain, was another success, and the owners of Made in Spain decided to create Zigurat, a mother company that would at first be dedicated to distribution, turning Made in Spain into a producing company for Zigurat, which also would at first distribute titles from independent companies. Years later, Made in Spain and Zigurat would completely merge into a single producer and distributor company. Meanwhile, Dinamic Software made their first steps when they launched for ZX Spectrum Yenght, a text adventure. And in the field of distribution, Erbe Software, the main Spanish software distributor for more than a decade, started their activity. In their first years, Erbe tried also to produce their own titles, but in this activity they didn't last for long. = Peak (1985‚Äì1989) = In 1985, with the birth of magazines Microman√≠a and Microhobby, videogames gained massive popularity, and the rest of the top companies of the Era, Opera Soft in 1986 and Topo Soft in 1987 started their activity, the first one with Livingstone, I presume, and the second one with Spirits, after their authors programmed for Erbe Software Las tres luces de Glaurung (Conquestador). The just born Zigurat had their biggest success on Sir Fred and El misterio del Nilo, unofficial version of the movie The Jewel of the Nile, which caused problems internationally because one of the characters of the game was too similar to Michael Douglas, and the authors were forced to change the graphic design of this character in the international versions. Dinamic had their first huge successes in the Johny Jones trilogy, comprising Saimazoom, Babaliba, and mainly Abu Simbel Profanation. After this, they would start another trilogy, the Moves trilogy, comprising Army Moves, Navy Moves, and much later Arctic Moves. And little by little, publishing titles starring famous sportsmen became popular. Dinamic were the first, with Basket Master starring Fernando Mart√≠n, and they were followed by other companies, with titles starring √Ångel Nieto, Carlos Sainz, Poli D√≠az, Emilio Butrague√±o and others. Meanwhile, Opera Soft published Goody, Sol Negro, Cosa Nostra, and above all, La Abad√≠a del Crimen, based on Umberto Eco's The Name of the Rose, considered one of the best titles of all the Golden Era of Spanish Software and one of the best titles ever released on ZX Spectrum. On the other hand, Topo Soft, the last of the big ones, quickly arrived on top with titles like Mad Mix Game and its continuation, and Survivor among others. Meanwhile, Dinamic published a text adventure version of Don Quijote, and after that, a section of Dinamic dedicated only to text adventures became independent, and they named themselves Aventuras AD, publishing titles like El Jabato among others. = Decline (1989‚Äì1992) = At the end of the 1980s, there arrived new 16 bit machines, Commodore Amiga, Atari ST, and little by little, IBM PC, followed by consoles like SNES and Sega Mega Drive. Although the Spanish companies did some tiny efforts to evolve, they never really switched to 16 bits and concentrated on the declining 8-bit market which, almost extinct in Europe, still had strength in Spain, mainly thanks to the rule Erbe Software, main distributor in the country, imposing a sales price of 875 pesetas (5,26 euros) for all their titles, trying to put an end to piracy. But at this moment, Spanish companies started having serious financial problems, and one by one they launched their last titles. Topo Soft funders left the company in 1989 to establish Animagic, whose main title was Mortadelo y Filemon II (Clever and Smart II). Born in bad times, they did not last for long. On the other hand, Topo Soft launched Lorna, Journey to the Center of the Earth, and above all, Gremlins 2, is the first time a Spanish video game company managed to get an exclusive license for all Europe from a Hollywood movie. In 1991, aware of the importance of 16 bit, they tried to switch, with the project of creating a desktop environment for MS-DOS, but the project did not succeed, and Topo closed on bankruptcy in 1992. Meanwhile, Opera Soft, after publishing Gonzalezzz, Mot and Angel Nieto Pole 500, starts decaying like the rest of the companies. In their last months, they launched titles like La Colmena and one dedicated to Barcelona 92, to disappear shortly after. Some of their components, like Gonzalo Su√°rez Girard (Gonzo Su√°rez), would later move to Pyro Studios launching titles like Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines among others. Aventuras AD, paradoxically, had their most successful period during this time of decline, launching the most of their titles during this time, mainly the Ci-U-Than Legends trilogy, composed of La Diosa de Cozumel, Los Templos Sagrados and Chich√©n Itz√°, being pioneers in Spain creating a predecessor of graphic adventures with La Aventura Espacial, a text adventure controlled by menus. Nevertheless, the sales did not last for long, and Aventuras AD disappeared in 1992. Zigurat and Dinamic were the only companies which survived from the Golden Era of Spanish Software, although they had to transform and abandon their previous activity. Zigurat, after an 8-bit market collapsed, started developing coin up arcade games, lasting for many years. Dinamic Software, on the other hand, after publishing After the War, Narco Police and Risky Woods, closed on bankruptcy and was refounded as Dinamic Multimedia in 1993, having in PC F√∫tbol as their biggest success during the 1990s. However, the dot-com bubble finished Dinamic Multimedia in 2001, but before this, the original founders of the company, who had left it in 1999, had already founded FX Interactive, which is still active nowadays. 2010s resurgence The 1990s and 2000s have been described as \\"lost decades\\" for the Spanish video game industry. However, Alberto Flores de Rio wrote in the Encyclopedia of Video Games that the 2010s may be a resurgence for Spanish-based game development. Akaoni Studio and MercurySteam started off the decade with financially successful games. Alejando Alcolea of Hobby Consolas called 2015 the possible start for a \\"second golden age of Spanish software\\".

Thiagraj Soobramoney was terminally ill, suffering from ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease, and of limited means. His kidneys had failed in 1996, and his condition had been diagnosed as irreversible. To survive even for a while, he required renal dialysis. After exhausting his funds on private providers, he sought the treatment free from the dialysis program of the Addington Hospital, a state-funded institution in Durban, which rejected him on the grounds that his condition did not fulfill the requirements for eligibility: that he be curable within a short period of time, and that, as for his kidney failure, he be eligible for a kidney transplant.This latter condition he was unable to meet because of his heart condition. (Addington, like many other South African hospitals, had a severe shortage of resources.) Soobramoney brought an application to the Durban High Court for an order that Addington give him the necessary treatment, citing section 27(3) Constitution of South Africa which gives everyone the right not to be \\"refused emergency medical treatment,\\" and section 11 Constitution of South Africa insisting also on his constitutionally-protected right to life. The High Court dismissed his application, and he appealed to the Constitutional Court, which found Addington's standards to be reasonable and in his case fairly applied, and unanimously dismissed his appeal on the grounds that his non-treatment did not constitute a violation of his rights. While the court confirmed the state's constitutional duty to provide care, it found that, were Soobramoney to be given the full benefit of this, everyone else in his position would have to benefit as well; and that the state's limited resources could not accommodate such a burden. Biweekly renal dialysis, needed by Soobramoney to stay alive, would cost some R60,000 a year. To expand the programme to everyone who needed it would have a severe impact on the health budget, and would impinge on the state's other obligations. The court held, therefore, that the right to emergency medical treatment had only limited meaning: One who suffers a sudden catastrophe, which calls for immediate medical attention, should not be denied the available emergency services, and should not be turned away from a hospital equipped to administer the necessary treatment. The court ruled that Soobramoney's situation, an \\"ongoing state of affairs,\\" was not as such an \\"emergency.\\" His case fell instead under sections 27(1) and (2) of the Constitution, which deal with the allocation of non-emergency medical treatment, and which are qualified by the availability of resources. Because Addington's resources were limited, its policy was to admit only those patients who could be cured quickly, and those with chronic renal failure who are eligible for a kidney transplant. The court ruled that it could not interfere with the good-faith decisions of political organs and medical authorities as to the allocation of budgets and priorities. Nor could the right be taken to mean that the treatment of terminal illnesses had to be prioritised over other forms of medical care such as preventative health care. The court held further that the right to emergency medical treatment was independent of and not therefore inferable from the right to life, as section 27 of the Constitution deals specifically with health rights. These were to be interpreted in the context of the availability of health services generally, with the implication that there was room to challenge executive policies if they were unreasonable or applied unfairly. Concerns arose after this ruling that the court had frustrated the prospects of the poor and the socially-disadvantaged. The South-African Constitutional Court acknowledged that it was a ‚Äòhard and unpalatable fact‚Äô that Mr. Soobramoney could have get the treatment if he would have been wealthy. Its 2001 decision in Government v Grootboom, however, held the state to a much more rigorous standard for \\"reasonableness,\\" requiring that it give consideration to the needs of the most disadvantaged in the fulfilment of its constitutional obligations. The Grootboom case concerned the right to social housing. The Grootboom reasonableness test was applied by the South-African Constitutional Court in the Minister of Health v Treatment Action Campaign case (2002). The claimant argued that the Ministry of Health infringed section 27(3) Constitution of South Africa by failing to distribute the free medicine Nevirapine that could prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS from pregnant women to their fetuses and babies. The Court agreed explaining that the reasonableness test guaranteed that those people with financial issues would not be excluded from emergency health care when their life is in danger. Thiagraj Soobramoney died shortly after the court returned its decision.  Other countries  The South-African Constitutional Court referred to a 1996 case of the Indian Supreme Court on access to emergency health care in the Soobramoney case.Soobramoney v Minister of Health, KwaZulu-Natal [1997] ZACC 17, 1998 (1) SA 765 (CC), 1997 (12) BCLR 1696 (CC) (27 November 1997), Constitutional Court (South Africa) para. 18 referring to Paschim Banga Khet Mazdoor Samity and others v.

He made 9 further appearances for Buckinghamshire in that season, the last of which came against Hertfordshire. Returning to Australia, Parkinson made his first-class debut for South Australia against New South Wales in the 1981/82 Sheffield Shield.

These figures, one of four five wicket hauls he took, came against Western Australia in the 1982/83 Sheffield Shield. A lower order batsman, Parkinson scored 376 runs at a batting average of 12.12, with a single fifty score of 62, which came against Tasmania in the 1985/86 Sheffield Shield. In the same season that he made his first-class debut, he also made his List A debut for South Australia against Victoria in the 1981/82 McDonald's Cup. Seen as a player better suited to the longer format of the game, he made just 9 further List A appearances for South Australia, the last of which came against Central Districts during South Australia's tour of New Zealand in 1986/87. He struggled with the ball in the shorter format of the game, taking just 5 wickets at an expensive average of 56.80, with best figures of 2/43.

Key areas regulated by the statute currently include taxi and hire car services and compliance and enforcement, particularly in areas like safety and public transport ticketing and conduct. The Act was once the leading transport statute in Victoria but this is no longer the case as that position has been taken by the Transport Integration Act. Nonetheless, the Transport (Compliance and Integration) Act remains a key transport statute in Victoria particularly in a support capacity to the Transport Integration Act and to safety scheme and other statutes.See the following articles for expanded commentary on this point - Transport Legislation Review, Transport Integration Act, Transport Act 1983, Rail Safety Act and Bus Safety Act. The articles contain a host of Parliamentary statements about the respective positions of these statutes including the Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act  Short history  The Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act was initially enacted as the Transport Act 1983 which until June 2010 was the principal land transport statute in Victoria. The Transport Act initially established the main land transport organisations in Victoria following major institutional reform in the Victorian transport portfolio in the early 1980s. The Transport Act also contained the key land transport regulatory schemes. However, the development and enactment of the Transport Integration Act 2010 eventually led to that statute becoming the principal transport statute in Victoria, relegating the Transport Act to a secondary role. In effect, the major reform activity of the then Victorian Government's Transport Legislation Review led to substantial changes in the directions and style of Victoria's transport policy and legislation. The Transport Integration Act developed by the Review effectively removed the organisational establishment parts from the Transport Act as Victoria's transport agencies were re-established and reformed with cleaner and newer charters under the Integration Act. In addition, the Transport Act was progressively stripped of many of its substantive transport regulation schemes over many years from the mid-1990s to around 2010 due to the development and enactment of a range of stand alone transport regulation statutes,For example, the Rail Safety Act 2006, the Accident Towing Services Act 2007 and the Bus Safety Act 2009. many of them under the auspices of the Transport Legislation Review. These two factors combined and the fact that the Transport Act had, unlike the Transport Integration Act, never applied to ports and marine activities and effectively stripped the Transport Act of its pre-eminence.  Position in transport legislation hierarchy  Today, the Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act largely operates as a support statute in the hierarchy of Victorian transport statutes. It forms part of the transport policy and legislation framework in Victoria headed by the Transport Integration Act.Transport Integration Act 2010 - see paragraph (p) in the definition of \\"transport legislation\\" in section 3. As a result, the application of the Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act is subject to the overarching transport system vision, transport system objectives and decision making principles in the Transport Integration Act.  Act content  The content of the Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act consists of the following - = Part 1 - Preliminary = This Part contains some formal provisions covering title, commencement and definitions. It also confirms that the Act is transport legislation for the purposes of the Transport Integration Act.Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983, Part 2, sections 1, 2 and 2A. = Part 2 - Administration = The Act no longer contains provisions which establish transport agencies. Part 2 of the Act, on the other hand, contains a number of provisions which empower or relate to agencies established under the Transport Integration Act. For example, the Part contains powers able to be exercised by the Director of Public Transport such as powers relating to use and modification of infrastructure.Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983, Part 2, sections 9C to 9J. In addition, the Part contains a number of important financial provisions such as the establishment and operation of the Public Transport Fund.Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983, Part 2, section 11. = Part 3 - Powers of the Corporation = Part 3 of the Act contains few provisions.

He is also the first author in Indian publishing history to have all 6 of his fiction books simultaneously in the top 10 of the HT-Nielsen Bookscan national bestseller list for 4 weeks in a row.  Early life and education  Amish Tripathi was born in Mumbai and grew up near Rourkela, Odisha. He is an alumnus of Cathedral & John Connon School; St. Xavier's College, Mumbai; and Indian Institute of Management Calcutta.  Career  = As banker = He worked for 14 years in the financial services industry, in organizations such as Standard Chartered, Development Bank of Singapore, and IDBI Federal Life Insurance before turning to become an author. = As author = The Immortals of Meluha, Tripathi's first novel and the first in the Shiva Trilogy, was published in February 2010. The second book in the series, The Secret of the Nagas, was released on 12 August 2011, and the third and final installment, titled The Oath of the Vayuputras, was released on 27 February 2013. The Scion of Ikshvaku was released on 22 June 2015. It is the first book in the Ram Chandra Series. It follows the story of Ram and is a prequel to the Shiva Trilogy.

It opened at #1 on the national bestseller lists and became the highest-selling book of 2017. Raavan: The Enemy of Aryavarta, the third book in The Ram Chandra series, was released on July 1, 2019. Legend of Suheldev: The King Who Saved India, his first historical fiction book and the first book in Indic Chronicles was released on 20 June 2020. Tripathi released his first non-fiction book, Immortal India, in August 2017. It is a collection of his writings, such as articles published in various newspapers, speeches he wrote, debates he took part in, and select interviews at public forums. In 2019, Tripathi was appointed by the Government of India as the Director of The Nehru Centre, London, as a diplomatic role. = As film producer = In September 2020, he announced that He is turning into a producer as his latest novel, Legend of Suheldev: The King Who Saved India, is going to be made into a feature film. Tripathi will produce the film under his banner Immortal Studios along with Wakaoo Films and Casa Media.  Translations  Tripathi's novels have been translated into many languages, including Tamil, Hindi, Telugu, Bengali, Gujarati, Assamese, Malayalam, Marathi, Kannada, Estonian, Spanish, Portuguese, Indonesian, Polish, Czech, French, and Odia. Tripathi supports the translations, saying: > I genuinely believe that five years from today, we will have a situation > when other languages will account for higher sales of books than in English. > That is the big change happening in publishing where readers are taking > pride in their own culture. Another comparative example would be television, > where regional language channels garner more TRPs.  Influence  All of Tripathi's books (released and planned) are on religious topics. Being an atheist in his youth, Amish returned to faith while writing his first book. His grandfather was a Sanskrit scholar and a Pandit in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh. Tripathi says that he gathered most of his knowledge of Hindu theology and religion from his grandfather and his religious parents. He believes that \\"religiosity and liberalism go hand-in-hand in India\\". Sandipan Deb, former Executive Editor of Outlook and Editor of Financial Express, writes of the philosophical depth of Amish's books: \\"Through all Amish‚Äôs books flows a current of liberal progressive ideology: about gender, about caste, about discrimination of any kind. And what I believe separates him from the horde of Indian writers who have jumped on to the mythology bandwagon after Shiva‚Äôs (Shiva Trilogy's) success, is his historical research.\\"  Awards and recognition  * Listed among Top-50 Most Powerful People by India Today (2019) * Honorary Doctorate by Jharkhand Rai University for outstanding contribution to Art & Literature (2019) * Hello Hall of Fame Awards for Literary Excellence (2019) * Jashn-e-youngistan Award (2018) * Ustad Bismillah Khan Award (2018) for contribution to Indian culture * Kalinga International Literary Award (2018) * Distinguished Alumnus Award (2017) from IIM - Calcutta *Forbes Celebrity 100 List (2017) * Raymond Crossword Popular Fiction Award for his book Scion of Ikshvaku in (2016)  Bibliography  = Shiva Trilogy = * The Immortals of Meluha (2010) * The Secret of the Nagas (2011) * The Oath of the Vayuputras (2013) = Ram Chandra Series = * Scion of Ikshvaku (2015) * Sita: Warrior of Mithila (2017) * Raavan: Enemy of Aryavarta (2019) * A book will come to finish the series.

The term was first introduced by Richard E. Young and Robert F. Harman in 1988.

Tufts is known as outing the Daughters of the Revolution for having a blacklist about individuals and organizations, in 1928. This controversy led Tufts to be banned from the organization and to become an advocate for women's, labor, and social rights. Early life Helen Matilda Tufts was born in Newark, New Jersey in 1874. Her father was a Unitarian minister and her mother was a suffragist. In 1875, the family moved to Massachusetts, where Helen would graduate from Cotting High School in Lexington in 1892. After graduation, she worked as a proofreader and typesetter at Riverside Press. She then moved on to be a secretary at Houghton Mifflin in Boston. In April 1895 she met Helena Born, a writer, anarchist, and labor organizer. Born became a major influence on Tufts' lifestyle and activities; Tufts became vegetarian, acquired an interest in the writing of Walt Whitman, and became active in dress reform, anarchism, communism, and socialism. Daughters of the American Revolution In 1915 Tufts would join the Anne Adams Tufts chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR). In 1927 she discovered that the DAR maintained lists of \\"doubtful speakers.\\" These lists included the organizations such as the National Federation of Women's Clubs, the American Peace Society, and individuals like Jane Addams, William Allen White and Mary Wooley. After investigating, she made the lists public in February 1928. In March 1928 she wrote a pamphlet called \\"Our Threatened Heritage\\" to protest the blacklists. Fifteen DAR members, called the Committee on Protest and headed by Bailie, signed the pamphlet and helped to distribute it throughout the United States. Both members and officers of three greater Boston area chapters were involved in the group. At the annual DAR Congress in Washington, D.C., Tufts was accused of \\"disturbing the harmony\\" of the DAR organization and harming its reputation, after the pamphlet distributions and her persistence pushing for an explanation about the blacklists. One year later she failed to appeal for reinstatement in DAR. Later life After Tufts struggles with DAR and the blacklisting controversy, she continued to be active in the early women's movement and social movements. She formed a letter writing campaign to legalize birth control and in 1935, Tufts organized a campaign against legislation requiring Massachusetts teachers to take an oath affirming the United States and state constitutions. In 1947, Tufts and Bailie moved to Nantucket. The couple would move again in 1954 due to Tufts deteriorating eyesight and Bailie's Alzheimer-like symptoms, moving to Yellow Springs, Ohio to live with their daughter and her husband, Water Jolly. In 1956 Tufts book, Darling Daughter, a satire about the DAR blacklists and the red scare, was published.  Personal life  Through Born, Tufts met William Bailie, originally from Belfast, who lived in and owned a vegetarian restaurant co-op. Born and Bailie were romantically involved. In January 1901 Born was diagnosed with uterine cancer and died later that month. Bailie and Tufts lived together starting in the fall of 1901, and in October 1908 the two married. Bailie started a basket weaving business, which he ran until his retirement in 1946. The couple would have two children: daughter Helena Isabel, born in 1914, and son Terrill (nicknamed Sonny), born in 1916. The latter would die of spinal meningitis at age 3.  Death  In May 1957 William Bailie would die in a nursing home. Tufts moved to Miami, Florida in 1958 and later to Ft. Lauderdale. She would die in 1962.  In popular culture  Sheila Rowbotham's Rebel Crossings: New Women, Free Lovers, and Radicals in Britain and the United States is an account of the activist life of Tufts, along with William Bailie (her husband), Helena Born, Miriam Daniell, Gertrude Dix, and Robert Nicol.

History The barracks were built by the Royal Engineers' Office between 1880 and 1886. In 1873 a system of recruiting areas based on counties had been instituted under the Cardwell Reforms and the barracks were intended to become the depot for the 71st (Highland) Regiment of Foot and the 78th (Highlanders) Regiment of Foot. Following the Childers Reforms, the barracks became depot of the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders in 1881. During the First World War, the barracks was used to process many thousands of volunteer recruits. Returning wounded and demobilising soldiers also passed through the barracks towards the end of the war and on its conclusion. Conscientious objectors were, for a time, held here, as was the crew of a captured German submarine. The barracks remained in use as the base of the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders until September 1960 when the regiment moved to Fort George, shortly before the amalgamation of Seaforths and Camerons. Architecture Built in the Baronial style, it consists of 4 2-storey blocks enclosing 3 sides of the parade ground. The north-west and west blocks each have, at their centre, twin conical-roofed drum towers linked by a balcony above the round-arched entrance.

Print Media in Uganda There are number of newspapers in Uganda today. The New Vision is Uganda's leading English daily newspaper. It is a state owned newspaper and has the largest nationwide circulation. The Daily Monitor is independent English language newspaper and second in circulation to The New Vision. The two papers dominate the print section of media in Uganda. Over the last decade, as Uganda's political opposition has gained strength, the Monitor newspaper has aligned itself more with the agenda of the opposition to counter the perceived government agenda fronted by the New Vision. This competition many times leads to entirely different aspects getting coverage in the five largest news publications in the country. For example, during the recent 2011 Walk To Work protests in the country, various government sources accused The Daily Monitor alongside other independent newspapers of having an anti government agenda and favoring the opposition and demonstrators.Walk To Work: \\"Journalists Slap A Ban On Government Activities Over Attacks\\",Uganda Radio Network, May 13, 2011, accessed August 13, 2011 Besides these two newspapers, there are also other papers, such as Eihwa ‚Äì a privately-owned newspaper published in the Runyankore/Runyakitara and Bukedde newspaper, which is a state owned daily published in the Luganda language. There is also a daily called Red Pepper that started out as a weekly tabloid but is now one of the leading daily newspapers. Other papers include The Weekly Observer, The Independent, The Razor among others. Tabloids abound, with sensationalism and soft erotica a common theme among tabloids like Onion and Entasi. Besides newspapers, there are a number of online news websites. Key among these are PML Daily, and Education News Uganda, ChimpReports, Vanguard News Uganda, Globe News, among others. There are also a number of magazines that come out every month including Bride & Groom, which is printed by the state owned The New Vision; African Woman are also other popular magazine. Elyte magazine and Newslex Super Magazine is one of the new entertainment oriented magazines in the country today. Television Uganda is now driving towards migrating from analog to digital TV broadcasting. The Uganda Communication Commission has launched a country-wide campaign to ensure that users switch to the standard. To access digital TV, users need to have digital-ready TV sets or purchase digital TV decoders. The Commission has licensed up to five firms to sell free-to-air decoders in the country.http://www.monitor.co.ug/Business/Technology/Uganda-approves-five- firms-to-deal-in-free-to-air-decoders/-/688612/2204138/-/rpe3jez/-/index.html Uganda approves five firms to deal in free-to-air decoders Users also have the option of subscribing to Digital Pay TV service providers such as DSTV, GoTV, Zuku, SimbaTV and Startimes to access both paid-for and Free-to-air channels.http://www.dignited.com/10440/uganda-digital-tv-migration-beginners- guide-switching-analog-digital-tv/ Uganda Digital TV Migration: A beginner‚Äôs guide to switching from Analog to Digital TV Radio :See also: List of radio stations in Africa: Uganda Like in television, radio was dominated by the state owned Radio Uganda up until the early 1990s when the first independent radio stations got licenses to operate. Sanyu fm and Capital fm are among the first and oldest radio stations in Uganda. Gradually other stations have joined the media industry and as of November 2013 there are well over 100 different radio stations on FM alone. Some other popular stations include CBS, Simba, Super, Record FM and Dembe. Programming on radio is dominated by music, with most stations following a Top 40 format. Talk shows and comedy are also popular. Radio is now embracing new kind of media and integrating with other communication channels. For instance Radio stations in Uganda integrate mobile technology in their programming to increase on audience engagement.http://www.dignited.com/152/how-the-mobile-phone-changed- the-way-we-listen-to-radio-in-africa/ How the Mobile Phone changed the way we listen to Radio in Africa Listeners can call in to a talk show and contribute their own opinions about what's been talked about.

Internet The internet as a media platform in Uganda is still quite new. Internet penetration levels are still very low when compared to other African countries. The recent Indian Ocean fiber optic cable project brought a lot of optimism and lead to an increased interest in the internet as a media platform.Business News: \\"EASSy cable to be online by 2010\\" ,The New Vision, October 9, 2008, accessed August 13, 2011 It also led to investment with a number of local telecommunication companies investing into broadband and gprs subscription services. This has led to a surge in levels of internet penetration with almost anyone able to connect to the internet using simple USB dongles or even via mobile phones. The recent Facebook deal with MTN Uganda made Facebook by far the most popular website in the country and a place where most young and working class individuals spend a lot of time. The hope is that these new opportunities will spur more individual investments in the internet sector. A number of the local newspapers operate newspapers online. These newspapers, particularly those of Monitor, New Vision and Newslex Point, are among the most popular Ugandan websites.

The site sits on federal land, and access by the public is restricted. The kilns represent the only remaining brickyard in Washington, D.C., and one of the few extant examples of the rounded \\"beehive\\" kiln style. The structures are constructed of red common brick, lined with heat-resistant firebrick and capped with arched, brick roofs. The complex also contained eight exhaust stacks. There is a small gauge rail system, with a standard rail siding. A factory building and drying shed, which contains 38 drying tunnels, are also still visible on the site.  History  Rectangular brick kilns were originally built on the site going back to at least 1909. It wasn't until 1927‚Äì1931 that nine of the now-iconic, circular beehive kilns were constructed. Three additional kilns were built at a later date. A number of companies operated at the site, including the Hudson Brick and Supply Company and the United Clay Products Company. Locally, the West Brothers Brick Company also manufactured bricks using beehive kilns, but that operation was closed in 1942 for the construction of the Pentagon. The complex permanently closed in 1972, and was transferred to the United States Department of Agriculture in 1976.

The author wrote the book in Afrikaans and in English. It is set in South Africa at the time of the first democratic elections. Plot summary Kristien, the narrator, is a white academic who goes back to South Africa to visit her grandmother after an attack by black youths on the old lady which leaves her tied to bed. Before she dies, she wishes to tell Kristien the story of their Afrikaner family, a task which grandmother and granddaughter find very important. Memories of Kristien's past in London show that her life has been aimless until now; she has been passive towards things that happen to her, simply fulfilling the need to be away from South Africa and her parents (who had, during their lifetime, supported apartheid). Giving up her self- imposed exile is, at first, a resignation to Kristien, but gradually she learns that the country of her birth is changing towards the better. The first democratic elections are close, and through meetings with black and white people and the stories her grandmother tells her about their family's origins, which show almost only the female side of events and go back to a black foremother, Kristien learns to see South Africa as her home country. In the night before the elections, Kristien's sister kills her children, her violent, racist husband and herself to escape a life she can no longer bear to live. In the same night, the grandmother dies from the aftermath of the attack. Nevertheless, Kristien is optimistic about her future in South Africa.

Lousson was frequently on the road in the 1950s and 1960s and never recorded commercially except for an unreleased 1960s studio recording from Paris with violinist Vivian Villerstein. A private and rather shy individual, Lousson performed in bars in Paris through the 1960s, most frequently accompanied by fellow guitarist Jean-Marie Pallen, and appeared several times at the Django Reinhardt memorial festivals Samois-sur- Seine. According to author Michael Dregni, Lousson spent a number of years travelling in Italy, then returned to France in the early 1990s. Private recordings exist from a 1966 performance in Paris. He is seen at the start and end of the 1959 French film Les Pittuiti's performing \\"Les Deux Guitares\\" with Eug√®ne V√©es,This film is available via the INA website and the musical scene appears in the online preview supplied and also appears briefly in a 1978 Sten Bramsen documentary Django made for Danish television. Lousson's guitar style has been described as following the \\"most modern\\" of Django's styles as well as being influenced by Wes Montgomery and Jim Hall. At Samois in 1978 he is pictured using a Gibson ES-175 hollow bodied jazz guitar belonging to Django's brother Joseph. Francis-Alfred Moerman, who accompanied Sarane Ferret for many years, played with Lousson for several years in the 1960s and said, \\"Playing with Lousson was an extraordinary experience; he really had his father's genius in his fingers... he really was unlucky‚Äîhis talent was awesome, but he played in the 1960s, which were the worst years for jazz players, so he was never successful and left no [official] recordings.\\"Quoted in the film Les Compagnons de Route (film tribute to Francis-Alfred Moerman, part 1). Published by the Friends of Francis-Alfred Moerman, 2011 Feeling unappreciated by critics and not accepted by French authorities as the legal heir of Django, Lousson retired from playing in 1980. He reportedly had either ten or sixteen children.L.M. Oliver, 2008. Mini-documentary: Lousson Reinhardt He struggled financially and frequently lacked a guitar after giving it to a doctor as payment for treating one of his children. Five of his children were sons; Dregni states that one of them, Paul \\"Navire\\" Baumgartner, was the father of Dallas Baumgartner, a contemporary gypsy jazz guitarist. Dallas was raised by his great-aunt Kali, Lousson's half-sister, referred to as \\"Madame Rose\\" in Dregni's 2008 account, and retains private recordings of Lousson, a number of which have been published by him via YouTube. After living the nomadic life of his people, Lousson died in 1992 and was buried at Samois near Django Reinhardt and Joseph Reinhardt. The names of two of Lousson's children, Ch√¥ti and Gagoug, were commemorated musically when Django's widow, Naguine, conferred them on two previously unpublished compositions of Django as subsequently recorded by Matelo Ferret in 1960.

Life The eldest son of Joseph Phillimore, vicar of Orton-on-the-Hill, Leicestershire, by Mary, daughter of John Machin of Kensington, was born on 14 September 1775. He was educated at Westminster School and Christ Church, Oxford, where he matriculated on 30 May 1793, graduated B.A. in 1797, B.C.L. in 1800, and proceeded D.C.L. in 1804. Admitted a member of the College of Advocates on 21 November 1804, he practised with success in the ecclesiastical and Admiralty courts, and in 1806‚Äì7 was commissioner for the disposal of Prussian and Danish ships seized by way of reprisals for the violation of the neutrality of Hanover by the Prussian government, and the submission of Denmark to France. In 1809 he succeeded French Laurence as regius professor of civil law at Oxford, chancellor of the diocese of Oxford, and judge of the court of admiralty of the Cinque ports. On 17 March 1817 he was returned to parliament in the Grenville interest for the borough of St Mawes, Cornwall, vacant by the death of his friend Francis Horner; he continued to represent it until the dissolution of 2 June 1826. He was then (9 June) returned for Yarmouth, Isle of Wight, but did not seek re-election on the dissolution of 24 July 1830. Phillimore was one of the original members of a short-lived third party formed in 1818. During his brief parliamentary career he distinguished himself by his advocacy of Catholic emancipation and his expositions of international law. He was placed on the board of control for India upon its reconstitution on 8 February 1822, and held office until the fall of Lord Goderich's administration in January 1828. On 23 January 1833 he was named principal commissioner for the final adjudication of the French claims under the treaties of 1815 and 1818. He also presided over the registration commission appointed on 13 September 1836, and drafted the report. Phillimore was appointed king's advocate in the court of admiralty on 25 October 1834, and chancellor of the diocese of Worcester and commissary of the deanery of St Paul's Cathedral in the same year; chancellor of the diocese of Bristol in 1842, and judge of the consistory court of Gloucester in 1846. He received the honorary degree of LL.D. from the university of Cambridge in 1834, was elected Fellow of the Royal Society on 13 February 1840, and a trustee of the Busby charity on 23 May the same year. He retained the chair of civil law at Oxford until his death, which took place at his residence, Shiplake House, near Reading, on 24 January 1855. Works Phillimore gained in 1798 the university English essay prize by a dissertation on 'Chivalry,' printed in the 'Oxford English Prize Essays,' Oxford, 1836, vol. ii.

The length of the canal is . The canal was constructed in 1928. The canal is located close to the settlement of Pinega in Pinezhsky District, Arkhangelsk Oblast, Russia. The Pinega flows in the north-western direction, and close to the settlement of Pinega sharply turns south-west. Formerly, the Kuloy and the Pinega were one waterway flowing to the Mezen Bay of the White Sea; then the Pinega turned to the Northern Dvina. During a certain period, there was a bifurcation between the Kuloy and the Pinega, when the discharge of the Pinega partially was flowing to the Northern Dvina and partially it was flowing to the Kuloy. Currently, the bifurcation does not exist, and the Pinega is fully discharged into the Northern Dvina. As a trace of the former bifurcation, there is a depression between the Pinega and the Kuloy. The canal has been built in this depression. On the Kuloy side, the canal separates the Sotka River (upstream canal) and the Kuloy (downstream). The project of the canal construction between the Kuloy and the Mezen was first discussed in 1840. The idea behind was that the timber in the Sotka, the Kuloy, and other rivers in the Kuloy basin could be only rafted into the Mezen Bay, located remotely, or transported by land. It would be more convenient to channel the timber into the Pinega and downstream to the Northern Dvina. In 1844, the Arkhangelsk State Good Chamber decided that the project is unprofitable. In 1925, new research has been performed, cause by the growth of timber cutting in the Kuloy River basin. The construction of the canal took two years, from 1926 to 1928. There was one lock on the canal long. The minimum width of the canal is . The canal is currently in use, though it is pretty much neglected, the lock is broken, and the canal is too shallow for large boats. In summer, it sometimes almost dries out.

The second narrow-gauge railway in Natal was constructed from Esperanza at Umzinto on the South Coast via Ixopo to Donnybrook. The residents of Alexandra County and the Ixopo Division had been pressing for a railway for years. These counties were only tapped by the Railways at their extreme edges. The eastern edge of Alexandra County was served by the South Coast line, which had reached Umzinto in 1900, while the extreme western border of the Ixopo Division was served by the Underberg and Kokstad lines which had reached Donnybrook in 1905. Between these two lines for a distance of with the upper end of the district at above sea level, means of communication were very difficult. Since the cost of a Cape gauge line across this terrain was considered prohibitive, the farmers accepted the narrow-gauge railway which was offered. Umzinto-Donnybrook railway The line was officially opened to traffic on 3 June 1908 by his excellency the Governor of Natal, Sir Matthew Nathan. It was long from Esperanza where it met the South Coast line at Umzinto, to Donnybrook where it met the Underberg branch. A branchline from Ixopo to Madonela was added and completed on 2 February 1914.Statement Showing, in Chronological Order, the Date of Opening and the Mileage of Each Section of Railway, Statement No. 19, p. 187, ref. no. 200954-13 Manufacturer D.A. Hendrie Commonly known as the Hawthorn Leslie Side Tanks, the second batch of narrow-gauge locomotives of the Natal Government Railways (NGR) were built to the design of NGR Locomotive Superintendent D.A. Hendrie, based on his earlier design of the Hunslet Side Tank 4-6-2T locomotives of 1906. An order for six of these locomotives was placed with Hawthorn Leslie and Company. The locomotives were similar in appearance to the earlier Hunslet Side Tank, but with larger water tanks and more ornate boiler-mounted sandboxes. They also had round-top fireboxes, outside plate frames and used Walschaerts valve gear. Service =Natal Government Railways= The Hawthorn Leslie Side Tanks were acquired specifically to work the Donnybrook-Esperanza railway. When they were delivered in 1907 in anticipation of the opening of the Donnybrook line the following year, they became part of the Class N on the NGR and were numbered in the range from 4 to 9. =South African Railways= When the Union of South Africa was established on 31 May 1910, the three Colonial government railways (Cape Government Railways, NGR and Central South African Railways) were united under a single administration to control and administer the railways, ports and harbours of the Union. Although the South African Railways and Harbours came into existence in 1910, the actual classification and renumbering of all the rolling stock of the three constituent railways were only implemented with effect from 1 January 1912.The South African Railways ‚Äì Historical Survey. Editor George Hart, Publisher Bill Hart, Sponsored by Dorbyl Ltd., Published c. 1978, p. 25. In 1912, the NGR narrow-gauge locomotives were included in the SAR's narrow-gauge numbering scheme, but were not classified or renumbered and merely had an \\"NG\\" prefix, for narrow gauge, added to their existing engine numbers.South African Railways and Harbours Narrow Gauge Locomotive Diagram Book, 2'0\\" Gauge, S.A.R. Mechanical Dept. Drawing Office, Pretoria, 28 November 1932 Class NG3 locomotive at work in German South West Africa, c. 1917 In 1915, shortly after the outbreak of the First World War, the German South West Africa colony was occupied by the Union Defence Forces. Since a large part of the territory's railway infrastructure was destroyed or damaged by retreating German forces, an urgent need arose for locomotives for use on the narrow-gauge lines in that territory. In 1917, three of these locomotives, numbers NG4, NG6 and NG9, were transferred to the Defence Department for service in South West Africa. Numbers NG4 and NG9, and possibly all three locomotives, returned to South Africa after the war.Espitalier, T.J.; Day, W.A.J. (1947). The Locomotive in South Africa ‚Äì A Brief History of Railway Development. Chapter VII ‚Äì South African Railways (Continued). South African Railways and Harbours Magazine, December 1947. p. 1033. A system of grouping narrow-gauge locomotives into classes was only adopted by the SAR in the late 1920s. At that point, the four remaining Hawthorn Leslie Side Tanks, numbers NG4, NG5, NG8 and NG9, were designated on the SAR. In SAR service in South Africa, the Class NG3 remained mainly confined to the Natal narrow-gauge branches. One exception was no. NG5, which was transferred to the Avontuur branch in the Eastern Cape in 1939 to replace Class NG9 no. NG45, which was in turn transferred to the Upington-Kakamas branch to join her two sister engines, numbers NG44 and NG46. In Port Elizabeth, no. NG5 was employed on yard duties in and around Humewood Road, where it eventually became the last survivor of the Class NG3. It remained in service until it was sold out of service in 1946.Soul of A Railway ‚Äì System 3: Cape Midland, based in Port Elizabeth ‚Äì Part 1: The Port Elizabeth Narrow Gauge ‚Äì Caption 22 (Accessed on 10 December 2016) References 2560 2560 4-6-2 locomotives 2‚Ä≤C1‚Ä≤ n2t locomotives Hawthorn Leslie and Company locomotives 2 ft gauge locomotives Railway locomotives introduced in 1907 1907 in South Africa Scrapped locomotives ","title":"South African Class NG3 4-6-2T"},{"id":"32735138","text":"Richard Fleming (c. 1385‚Äì1431) was an English clergyman and Bishop of London.

Based on earlier songs, Delta bluesman Tommy McClennan recorded \\"Bottle It Up and Go\\" in 1939. The song has been interpreted and recorded by numerous artists, sometimes using alternate titles, such as \\"Step It Up and Go\\", \\"Shake It Up and Go\\", etc. Memphis Jug Band and Sonny Boy Williamson versions In 1932, the earliest version of \\"Bottle It Up and Go\\", a hokum blues with jug band accompaniment, was recorded by the Memphis Jug Band, a loose musical collective led by Will Shade and Charlie Burse. Although it has been said to be based on a \\"traditional piece known in the South\\", it was very much a modern concoction, for the lyrics refer directly to women driving automobiles, a theme that was continued in later versions by almost all other artists. A second version of the song was recorded and released by the Memphis Jug Band in 1934.Okeh Records 8959Papa Charlie McCoy reportedly recorded a \\"Bottle It Up\\" February 3, 1932 (Vocalion Records 1726), but it is not available. In 1937, John Lee \\"Sonny Boy\\" Williamson recorded the song as \\"Got the Bottle Up and Go\\" (or \\"Got Bottle Up & Gone\\").Bluebird Records 7012 It was performed as an early Chicago blues with Williamson on vocal and harmonica, accompanied by Big Joe Williams and Robert Lee McCoy (later known as Robert Nighthawk) on guitars. These early versions of \\"Bottle Up and Go\\" include the refrain \\"High-powered mama, daddy's (or papa's) got your water on\\", a line that had first appeared in 1930 as the title of the unrelated Memphis Jug Band song \\"Papa's Got Your Bath Water On\\", written and sung by Hattie Hart. Tommy McClennan song In 1939, Tommy McClennan recorded \\"Bottle It Up and Go\\" during his first recording session for Bluebird Records. His song includes \\"a catchy guitar lick, a stomping danceable groove and a neat structure which divided the twelve-bar [blues] stanza into verse and chorus: socking home a different coupler each time\\". It is a solo piece with McClennan on vocal and guitar and borrows lyrics from earlier songs. McClennan used verses similar to those found in \\"Hesitation Blues\\": \\"Now nickel is a nickel, a dime is a dime\\" and \\"The Duck's Yas-Yas-Yas\\": \\"Now my mama killed a chicken, she thought it was a duck, she put 'im on the table with 'is legs sticking up\\". He also used verses similar to those in Julius Daniels' 1927 song \\"Can't Put the Bridle On That Mule This Morning\\":Victor Records 21359-A \\"Now the nigger and the white man playin' seven-up, nigger beat the white man [but he's] scared to pick it [the winnings] up\\". These verses have been traced back to 19th-century work songs, which were noted in an 1870s newspaper article. McClennan, who had recently arrived in Chicago from the Delta, was cautioned by Big Bill Broonzy about using racially loaded lyrics in northern cities. According to Broonzy, McClennan stubbornly refused to compromise, resulting in a hasty exit out a window during one performance with McClennan's smashed guitar around his neck. \\"McClennan, for his part, reflected pensively that they had indeed been forced to 'bottle it up and go'\\". Bluebird released the song as the B-side of \\"Whiskey Headed Woman\\" in 1939. When McClennan re-recorded the song as \\"Shake It Up and Go\\" in 1942, he used different lyrics. Lead Belly versions Lead Belly performed this song in several variations, and he recorded it four times from 1940 to 1944. His versions, especially one with spoken interjections, were based on the Tommy McClennan recording, but in two recordings he added his own topical political commentary. He presented the song in both a fast and a slow tempo, but the guitar accompaniment was similar, no matter what the pace. In one recording, Lead Belly provided a spoken introduction in which he commented approvingly of the improved status of women as a result of their employment during World War Two: \\"a woman, when she's high-powered, she can drive her car, she can do most anything\\".Another version, titled \\"Uncle Sam Says (Bottle Up and Go)\\" referred to the military draft. In a third recording session, the folklorist Alan Lomax asked Lead Belly if he had written \\"Bottle Up and Go\\", and Lead Belly said he had not, but added that he had \\"fixed it up\\", that is, he had arranged it. John Lee Hooker versions John Lee Hooker performed several adaptations of \\"Bottle Up and Go\\" throughout his career and recorded several versions of the song, usually varying the lyrics. Biographer Charles Shaar Murray identified the song as \\"one of the templates on which a significant slice of Hooker's early repertoire is based\\". Hooker first recorded a solo performance as \\"Bundle Up and Go\\" in 1959 for The Country Blues of John Lee Hooker album. Around the same time, he recorded another version as \\"You Gotta Shake It Up and Go\\", which had a group arrangement.Galaxy Records 716 Hooker's later versions are usually titled \\"Bottle Up and Go\\" and are included on the albums John Lee Hooker on Campus (1963), It Serves You Right to Suffer (1966), Hooker 'n Heat (with Canned Heat, 1971), and Boom Boom (1992). Other versions Most versions of \\"Bottle Up and Go\\" recorded after Tommy McClennan's single use a combination of his verses and new lyrics. Recordings in the 1940s (often with a variation on the title) include those by Blind Boy Fuller (as \\"Step It Up and Go\\") (1940), and Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee (1942). Murray suggests that Chuck Berry's \\"Too Much Monkey Business\\" (1956) is adapted from McClennan's song. B.B. King recorded a version with Ike Turner on piano that was released on RPM Records as \\"Shake It Up and Go\\" (1952)\\", although King confuses himself by saying 'bottle up and go' half the time\\". He later re-recorded it for the Blues on the Bayou album (1998). References 1932 songs Blues songs Sonny Boy Williamson I songs 1952 singles 1959 singles John Lee Hooker songs B.B.

Background Robert Flemming, born in the diocese of York, was likely an illegitimate son of Robert Flemming, esquire, of Wath, near Ripon (d.1459). His aunt, Cecily Fleming, married, in 1407, Robert Waterton, 'Henry IV's esquire and right-hand man'. His uncle, Richard Fleming (d.1431), was Bishop of Lincoln and the founder of Lincoln College, Oxford. He was probably connected with the earlier days of the college, the foundation of which was left by his uncle in an incomplete and unfinished state. At any rate, he displayed afterwards his care for this society by some valuable presents. Probably also he had an early connection with the church at Lincoln, inasmuch as twenty years after his uncle's death, under the episcopate of Bishop Lumley, he was chosen to be dean (1451). Lincoln Cathedral was then in a most disturbed state from the long and bitter struggle which had been carried on between the late dean, John Mackworth, and the bishop, William Alnwick. Doubtless the disputes between the episcopal and decanal powers still continued, and this may have induced Flemming to leave his cathedral and become a resident in Italy. Here also he had far greater facilities for cultivating his literary tastes. Flemming is said by Leland and Pits to have distinguished himself at Oxford, and to have gained a reputation for his elegant Latin scholarship. Life in Italy His journey to Italy is attributed to his eager desire for instruction. He visited, according to the same writers, all the more celebrated universities, and formed friendships with their most learned scholars. At Ferrara he became the pupil of Baptista Guarino, professor of Greek and Latin, and attended his lectures for a considerable period. He then went to Rome, where he remained several years intent upon study. Here he formed a friendship with Platina, the author of the ‚ÄòLives of the Popes,‚Äô and librarian of the Vatican, and other learned men, and became known to the reigning pontiff, Sixtus IV, a pope whose sole recommendation was his love of letters. Pope Sixtus appointed Flemming to the office of prothonotary, and he thus became employed in the complicated affairs of the Roman see. In summer, during the hot season, it was his custom to retreat to Tivoli, and here he composed his poems, written in heroic metre and dedicated to the pope. Legacy These poems were entitled: 1. ‚ÄòLucubrationes Tiburtin√¶.‚Äô 2. ‚ÄòEpistol√¶ ad diversos.‚Äô 3. ‚ÄòCarmina diversi generis.‚Äô In addition to these Flemming is said to have compiled a dictionary of the Greek and Latin tongues, but whether this was written during his sojourn in Italy or after his return to England does not appear. Other works (unspecified) are attributed to him. Flemming, on his return from Italy, bestowed some valuable manuscripts, curiously illuminated, and, according to Wood, ‚Äòlimned on their margins with gold,‚Äô on Lincoln College, which are probably still to be found among the manuscript collections of that college. He also gave the college copies of his own works, and a table for the high altar in the college chapel. He had probably returned to England before 1467, in which year he was installed into the prebend of Leighton Manor in Lincoln Cathedral. This he exchanged in 1478 for that of Leighton Buzzard. There does not appear to be any special record of his work as dean of Lincoln. Both his predecessor and his successor were remarkable for their turbulence. But the great number of dispensations from Pope Sixtus found to be existing in Lincoln Cathedral at the visitation in 1501 may have been due to Flemming's influence with that pope. He died in 1483.

Ngor Women in Senegal have a traditional social status as shaped by local custom and religion. According to 2005 survey, the female genital mutilation prevalence rate stands at 28% of all women in Senegal aged between 15 and 49.Female Genital Mutilation in Senegal Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development, Germany (September 2011) History The traditional division of labour in Senegal saw women responsible for household tasks such as cooking, cleaning, and childcare. They were also responsible for a large share of agricultural work, including weeding and harvesting, for such common crops as rice. Women of the nobility used to be influential in political scenes. This is partly because matrilineage was the means for a prince to become king (particularly in the Wolof kingdoms). Such lingeer as Yacine Boubou, Ndate Yalla and her sister Njembeut Mbodji are hailed as inspirations for contemporary Senegalese women. In recent decades, economic change and urbanization has led to many young men migrating to the cities, such as Dakar. Rural women have become increasingly involved in managing village forestry resources and operating millet and rice mills. The government's rural development agency aims to organize village women and involve them more actively in the development process. Women play a prominent role in village health committees and prenatal and postnatal programs. In urban areas, despite women's second-class status within Islam, cultural change has led to women entering the labour market as office and retail clerks, domestic workers and unskilled workers in textile mills and tuna-canning factories. Non-government organizations are also active in promoting women's economic opportunities. Micro-financing loans for women's businesses have improved the economic situation of many. Senegal ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly, as well as the additional protocol. Senegal is also a signatory of the African Charter of Human and People's Rights, which was adopted during the 2003 African Union Summit. However, Senegalese feminists have been critical of the government's lack of action in enforcing the protocols, conventions and other texts that have been signed as a means of protecting women's rights.  Women's rights  Women in Senegal face a number of disparities in their social status. Women have high rates of illiteracy. They make up less than 10% of the formal labour force. Female genital mutilation is a persistent practise in some rural areas, despite being outlawed by the constitution of 2001. Women's legal rights are similar via polygyny marriages, and Islamic law involving property ownership. = Female genital mutilation = Female genital mutilation is present in Senegal.\\"FGC Prevalence Rates Diagram\\", African Women's Health Center, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, accessed 7 September 2011. According to 2005 survey, the FGM prevalence rate is 28% of all women aged between 15 and 49. There are significant differences in regional prevalence.

The current structure is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History In the 17th century this was the manor house for the Preston family, and probably incorporated the guest house of Furness Abbey. By the 19th century the Prestons had left the house, and it remained empty until it was purchased by the Furness Railway in 1847. The Lancaster architects Sharpe and Paley converted it into a hotel to accommodate visitors to the abbey. This contained 36 bedrooms and \\"only\\" three bathrooms. The public rooms included an entrance hall and a reading and sitting room, both with stained glass windows, a billiard room, and a ballroom. It was extended in 1866‚Äì69, probably by E. G. Paley, to link it to the newly built Furness Abbey railway station. In 1953‚Äì54 the building was demolished, other than part of the north wing. Architecture and assessment The building, as it currently exists, is constructed in red sandstone with slate roofs. It is in two and three storeys. It \\"represents a fragment of a substantial hotel that served the Furness Railway\\".

Although she served for nine years, her most active period was in her first year when she served in the Crimean War. Black Sea and Sea of Azov During the summer of 1855, Grinder carried out raids on Russian food and ammunition stores to prevent supplies reaching the Russian troops in the Crimea. Grinder and nine other gunboats (Beagle, Boxer, Cracker, Curlew, Fancy, Jasper, Vesuvius, Swallow and Wrangler ) were employed destroying fisheries and corn stores, as well as ammunition stores, around the Sea of Azov. Their raids forced the Russian land forces to maintain a state of constant readiness lest there be a landing. The British naval squadron, including Grinder, was active on 23 September 1855 at the entrance to the Sea of Azov in destroying communications between Temryuk and Taman, an area of shallow seas, swamps and bridges. For some of this summer period, Grinder, under the command of Lieutenant Francis Trevor Hamilton, served as a tender to the first rate , flagship of Rear Admiral Sir Edmund Lyons, Bart GCB. From July 1855 she was commanded by Lieutenant Burgoyne. Grinder played her small part in the actions against the fort at the head of Dnieper Bay as part in a joint force of British and French warships, including the steam frigate Valourous, Gladiator and Clinker, on 18 October 1855. Further activities of the squadron, including Grinder, consisted of destroying vast quantities of provisions and fuel near the town of Yeisk in the Sea of Azov on 3 November 1855, just as the weather was changing to make naval activities there impossible. The attacks were on such a broad front that even the presence of 1500 cossacks in the area did not inconvenience the landing parties. Fate Grinder was decommissioned in 1864, and broken up at Portsmouth.

Fletcher was descended from the highland clan of Fletcher, his ancestors, according to tradition, being the first who ‚Äòhad raised smoke or boiled water on the braes of Glenorchy.‚Äô He was the eldest son of Angus Fletcher, a younger brother of Archibald Fletcher of Bennice and Dunans, Argyleshire, by his second wife, Grace m'Naghton, and was born at Pooble in Glen Lyon, in 1746. After attending the grammar school of Kenmore in Breadalbane he entered the high school of Perth in his thirteenth year. He served an apprenticeship to a writer to the signet in Edinburgh, and became confidential clerk to Lord-advocate Sir James Montgomery, who introduced him to Mr. Wilson of Howglen, with whom he became partner. In his earlier years he devoted much of his spare time to study, rising at four in the morning to read Greek, attending a debating society, and enrolling himself in some of the university classes, including that of moral philosophy, where he had as one of his fellow-students Dugald Stewart, with whom he became intimately acquainted. In 1778 he was chosen, on account of his knowledge of Gaelic, to negotiate with the M'Cra highlanders, who refused to embark at Leith for service in America. When about this time the Faculty of Advocates brought forward a resolution that no one above the age of twenty- seven should be admitted a member of their body, Fletcher wrote a pamphlet against the proposal, which was so successful that the resolution was withdrawn. The pamphlet gained him the friendship of Henry Erskine. He also distinguished himself by an ‚ÄòEssay on Church Patronage,‚Äô in which he supported the popular side. In 1784, when burgh reform was first agitated in Scotland, he became secretary of the society then formed in Edinburgh, and drew up the principal heads of a reform bill to be submitted to parliament. He was deservedly called ‚Äòfather of burgh reform,‚Äô both on account of his initiation of the agitation and the skill and energy with which he directed it. In 1787 he was sent as delegate to London by the Scottish burghs to promote this object, when he gained the friendship of Fox and other leaders. It was not till 1790 that he was called to the Scottish bar. The following year he married Miss Eliza Dawson, a lady of literary tastes. At first his success at the bar was hindered by his advanced political opinions, but he gradually acquired a considerable practice. He was a supporter of the American war of independence, a prominent abolitionist, and so strong a sympathiser with the French Revolution that he attended every anniversary of the fall of the Bastille from 14 July 1789. He acted without fee as counsel for the political reformer Joseph Gerrald and ‚Äòother friends of the people‚Äô charged with sedition in 1793, and in 1796 was one of the minority of thirty-eight who opposed the deposition of Henry Erskine, dean of the faculty. In 1816 he retired from the bar on account of declining health, and took up his residence at Parkhill, Stirlingshire. Still taking a special interest in questions affecting the burghs of Scotland, he published in 1825 ‚ÄòAn Examination of the Grounds on which the Convention of Royal Burghs claimed the right of altering and amending the Setts or Constitution of the Individual Burghs.‚Äô He died at Auchindinny House, near Edinburgh, 20 December 1828. He is described by Lord Brougham as ‚Äòone of the most upright men that ever adorned the profession, and a man of such stern and resolute firmness in public principle as is very rarely found united with the amiable character which endeared him to private society.‚Äô References 1746 births 1828 deaths People from Perthshire Archibald Members of the Faculty of Advocates British reformers ","title":"Archibald Fletcher (reformer)"},{"id":"32735514","text":"Cowboy Henk is a Belgian absurd humor/surreal humour gag-a-day comic strip series, drawn by Herr Seele and written by Kamagurka. It was originally published in the newspaper De Morgen, but later taken over by the magazine HUMO in which it is still published today and for whom Henk is now their mascot. The series was in continuous syndication from 1981 until 2011. After the brief interruption it was continued again in the spring of 2013. History In 1981 Kamagurka published a one-album-only long comic story named : Mijnheerke Plagiaat (\\"Mister Plagiarism\\"), in the Belgian newspaper Vooruit (later De Morgen). At the end of the story the comics character Mr. Plagiaat decided to think up a comic character of his own, whom he named Cowboy Henk, contrary to Zorro.Kamagurka & Herr Seele, \\"Mijnheerke Plagiaat\\", Loempia, 1981. On September 24, 1981 the first Cowboy Henk gag appeared in print. Kamagurka wrote the jokes and dialogues while his friend, Herr Seele, drew the stories. Originally Cowboy Henk appeared in black-and-white as a gag- a-day comic of only four to six panels per episode. Sometimes he had adventures spread over more pages too. De Morgen received many angry letters from readers who complained about the style of comedy. In Flanders Cowboy Henk was published exclusively in the magazine HUMO from 1982 until 2011, usually as a single page gag-a-day page. He also appeared on many magazine covers, thus becoming one of HUMO 's official mascots. In October 2011, after nearly 30 years of continuous publication, the series was no longer published in HUMO and disappeared without fanfare. According to the redaction the series hardly got any reactions from readers anymore, even when publication was ceased. From that moment on until 2012 Seele drew the short-lived black-and-white comic strip Dikke Billie Walter (\\"Fat Billie Walter\\"), with Kamagurka as script writer. On April 10, 2013, the Flemish radio station Studio Brussel interviewed Seele and he announced Henk's comeback in HUMO. The character indeed reappeared. First as a gag cartoon, spread over an entire page and making topical comedy, later as a parody comic strip series of Belgian history until finally back in its old form as a comic strip. The series has been translated in French (as Cowboy Maurice), Spanish and English in magazines such as L'Echo des Savanes and RAW. In The Netherlands the comics are published in Vrij Nederland. Character Cowboy Henk is a muscular adult male with a characteristically brawny chin and a long yellow quiff which, according to the jubilee story De Bananenkuif (2001) is made from bananas.Seele, Herr, \\"De Bananenkuif\\", De Stripuitgeverij, 2001. Usually Henk wears a white T-shirt with short sleeves, blue pants and black shoes with round noses. In his first gags Henk was a real cowboy, which explains his name.Kamagurka and Herr Seele, \\"Mijnheerke Plagiaat\\", Loempia, 1981. Henk is a flat character and completely unpredictable. He often behaves in a bizarre way, but the world around him is also very surreal. He often reacts calmly to all the madness around him, but can get aggressive and even violent at times. Sometimes Henk behaves like a na√Øve child still living at his mother's place and going to school. In other gags he behaves more like an adult by going to work or experiencing with sex and drugs. Since Henk has had sex with both men and women in his cartoons we can conclude he is bisexual. He has no stable profession, despite the fact that some successive gags depict him as a journalist, hairdresser or a painter. Henk is also the only recurring character. Other side characters only appear in a few gags, then disappear again. Style Much like Kamagurka's other comics and cartoons Cowboy Henk is an absurd humor comic strip series, aimed at adults. Herr Seele told in interviews that Zippy the Pinhead by Bill Griffith was a major inspiration. Some Cowboy Henk gags have an almost child friendly atmosphere while others are full of shocking dirty jokes, toilet humour and/or black comedy. Because of the simple, na√Øve drawing style the series have been read by many children in HUMO over the years. This led to several angry letters by parents who complained about the child unfriendly vulgarities in the comic strip. In other media Herr Seele dressed as Cowboy Henk In Kamagurka and Seele's comedy TV series Lava and Johnnywood sometimes short animated cartoons featuring Henk were seen, with Seele voicing his character. He also performed Cowboy Henk (with a yellow quiff tied to his bald head) while Kamagurka told Henk's surreal adventures to the audience. In their radio show Studio Kafka they also made audio plays about Henk. Award The series won the 2014 Prix du Patrimoine at the Angouleme International Comics Festival. In popular culture * Cartoonist Gal once drew a series of cartoons for the magazine Panorama/De Post (nowadays P-Magazine) which showed the news events of the years 1955‚Äì1984. For the year 1956 he drew a cartoon in which Elvis Presley dances amidst of all kinds of politicians and media phenomena of that year.

Gross.Schweizer, Paul A: Wings Like Eagles, The Story of Soaring in the United States, page 62. Smithsonian Institution Press, 1988. Design and development Gross was a graduate of Akaflieg Darmstadt and the Sky Ghost was his third glider design after the Baker-McMillan Cadet and the Akron Condor. Gross's Sky Ghost was innovative for its era, in that it had tandem seating with dual controls. In the 1930s most glider flight training was accomplished by having a student fly short hops under supervision of an instructor on the ground. The aircraft fuselage is made from welded steel tubing, with all surfaces covered in doped aircraft fabric covering. Its span wing is mounted above the rear seat and supported by parallel lift struts. The tail is cable-braced. The cockpit is open, without a windshield. The landing gear is a conventional arrangement for fixed wing powered aircraft, rather than the more common central monowheel used on gliders. A wooden skid is also mounted on the fuselage center line. In addition to the main landing gear the aircraft has a tail skid and wing tip skids in the form of tubular loops. The aircraft's name was derived from its appearance in flight, which was described as \\"eerie\\", due to its matte black finish. Operational history On at least one occasion the Sky Ghost was bungee launched from Harris Hill, New York. The first multi-place glider flight of over two hours ever flown in the USA was completed by Gross in the Sky Ghost. It was also the first multi-place glider entered in the US Nationals, when it competed in 1932.

National Gallery, London. 51 cm x 40.3 cm. Portrait of D√ºrer's Father at 70 (or The Painter's Father) is a 1497 oil on lime painting attributed to the German painter and printmaker Albrecht D√ºrer, now in the National Gallery, London. Along with the 1490 Albrecht D√ºrer the Elder with a Rosary, it is the second of two portraits of the artist's Hungarian father Albrecht D√ºrer the Elder (1427‚Äì1502). The sitter's similarity to the earlier portrait, as well to a 1486 silverpoint drawing believed to be a self-portrait by his father, leave no doubt as to his identity.Bailey, 58There are no surviving sources referring to D√ºrer's portraits of his father from the artist's lifetime, however the connection was well made by the end of the 1500s. The London panel is thought to be one of a number of copies of a lost original.Susan Foister It is in poor condition, having suffered paint loss in the background and in areas of the cloak. It was cleaned in 1955, revealing especial quality in the description of the face, leading some to believe that it is a D√ºrer original. However this claim is not made by the National Gallery who display it as \\"attributed to Albrecht D√ºrer\\".Wieseman, Marjorie. \\"'The Painter's Father', 1497\\". National Gallery, London, 30 June 2010. Retrieved 7 August 2011. Although a master goldsmith and well traveled, Albrecht the elder lived in poverty all his life. With his much younger wife Barbara Holper, he fathered 17 children, of which only two reached adulthood. He died in 1502, five years after this portrait was completed. He was supportive of his son's precocious talent and recognised it from an early age, sending him to apprenticeship with Michael Wolgemut, one of the highest regarded painters in Nuremberg at the time. From his travels Albrecht senior came into contact with the second generation of Netherlandish Renaissance painters, and through them passed on a key influence on his son's artistic development. D√ºrer painted two portraits of his father, one from April 1490‚Äîthe month before he left on his travels as a journeyman painter‚Äîand Portrait at 70 just after his return home to Nuremberg. Following his father's death the artist wrote an affecting eulogy in which he said that in his life the older man \\"underwent manifold afflictions, trials and adversities. But he won just praise from all who knew him\\".Sturge Moore, 36 Albrecht D√ºrer the Elder Following his father's death five years after this portrait was painted, D√ºrer wrote that Albrecht the elder \\"passed his life in great toil and stern hard labour, having nothing for his support save what he earned with his hand for himself, his wife and his children, so that he had little enough. He underwent manifold afflictions, trials and adversities. But he won just praise from all who knew him for he lived an honourable Christian life, was a man patient of spirit, mild and peaceable to all and very thankful to God. For himself he had little need of company and worldly pleasures; he was also of few words, and was a God-fearing man.\\" Detail He was born Albrecht Ajt√≥si in 1427 in Ajt√≥s, near the village of Gyula in the Kingdom of Hungary.Sturge Moore, 35 In 1455 had moved to Nuremberg and changed his name to D√ºrer to adapt to the local Nuremberg dialect. He took up an apprenticeship as a goldsmith under the tutelage of Hieronymus Holfer. In 1467, the year his apprenticeship ended, he married Barbara, Holfer's 15-year-old daughter. The couple had 18 children, only two of whom survived into adulthood.Brion, 16 D√ºrer's Father's Self-portrait, 1486. Silverpoint drawing attributed to Albrecht the elder. Albertina Museum, Vienna. Albrecht traveled a great deal, and came into contact with the Netherlandish painters while in Flanders. While there he was exposed to the work of both Jan van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden, and developed a strong appreciation for them which he passed on to his son, whose art displays a large debt to these painters.Brion, 17Von Fircks, Julian. \\"Albrecht D√ºrer the Elder with a Rosary\\". In: Van Eych to Durer. Borchert, Till-Holger (ed). London: Thames & Hudson, 2011. 419. From his father, D√ºrer learned to appreciate the fine, almost forensic, attention to realistic detail favoured by the northern painters, as well as their use of brilliant colour. These lessons were key to the young artist's development, and set him apart from his fellow German artists whose work can often feel crude and heavy-handed by comparison. Albrecht apprenticed his son to Michael Wolgemut,D√ºrer later described Wolgemut as his 'second father'. Brion, 39 a painter also aware of the northern artists, when he was 14. Already the young artist was showing such potential that his father believed he should be trained by the best local master available.Brion, 21 Description Albrecht D√ºrer the Elder with a Rosary, April 1490. Oil on oak Panel, 47.5 cm x 39.5 cm. Uffizi, Florence. Albrecht the elder is shown, aged 70, in half view against a flat reddish background. He is wearing a black Hungarian hat and long brown robe with a black undergarment. He has an intelligent piercing gaze, although it may be interpreted as hostile glance towards the viewer. The toll of age wears heavily on the old man's gaunt features. His fleshy cheeks are heavily folded, his lips thin and his hair wispy and in disarray.Brion 20 His skin is heavily wrinkled, and his eyes are narrow and give a weary appearance. By comparison to the 1490 Albrecht D√ºrer the Elder with a Rosary, his hands, though visible, are inactive, possibly due to arthritis. Compared to his mild and pious expression in the 1490 portrait, Albrecht now seems impatient, while in the words of Marcel Brion the \\"stunned look in his eyes seems already to foresee his own death...[the] almost haggard intensity of [his] questioning gaze [is] directed upon those about him as if they could solve the urgent problems to which his own set lips had no answer.\\" Albrecht retains some of the handsomeness of his youth; he has strong bone structure with the high cheek-bones characteristic of the Slav and Magyar blood in Hungarian appearance. He has almost exotic eyes, which approach his temples in an almost eastern way. Provenance and attribution There is strong evidence that the portrait was originally hung alongside D√ºrer's 1498 Self-portrait. Both are of the same dimensions and show the subject at half length. In 1650 the city of Nuremberg gave the pair of portraits to Thomas Howard, Earl of Arundel as a present to King Charles I of England, at a time when D√ºrer was regarded as the city's proudest son.Wieseman, Marjorie E. \\"'The Painter's Father', 1497\\". National Gallery, London, 30 June 2010. Retrieved 13 August 2011. Both were later sold by Cromwell. Albrecht the Elder's portrait was eventually acquired by the National Gallery in 1904, where is bears the Inventory number NG1938. The self-portrait was bought by the Museo del Prado in Madrid. When the National Gallery bought the painting, they had little information about its attribution or provenance. A piece of a paper label was found on the reverse which was believed to have dated from the 17th century, and was similar to another found on the back of D√ºrer's 1498 self-portrait. In addition they noted the sitter's resemblance to the 1490 portrait and 1486 assumed self-portrait, and found a 1639 inventory record which described a portrait of his father as wearing a black hat and wearing \\"a dark yellow gown wherein his hands are hidden in the wide sleeves painted upon a reddish ground all crack‚Äôt\\". These discoveries lead to the belief that it was the D√ºrer painting recorded in Charles I possession.

The three members of the band Beak (Geoff Barrow, Billy Fuller and Matt Williams) produced the album. Background Before she began her singing career, Anika was a political journalist who spent her time between Berlin and Bristol, England. She met producer Geoff Barrow (of Portishead), who was looking for a female vocalist to work with his band Beak. Anika joined the band in the studio and recorded nine songs in 12 days with no overdubs. Critical reception The album received generally favorable reviews. It earned a collective score of 65 out of 100 from Metacritic. Heather Phares from AllMusic stated, \\"Though the album is mostly covers, Anika imprints her identity on every track.

W. Coburn School of Law was the law school of Oral Roberts University. The school was named after donor Orin Wesley Coburn, the founder of Coburn Optical Industries and the father of future US politician Tom Coburn. The school opened in 1979. Its founding dean was Charles Kothe, a Tulsa, Oklahoma labor attorney. Other professors included Anita Hill, John Eidsmoe, Gary Lane, Herb Titus, and Rutherford Institute founder John W. Whitehead. In 1986, the school closed, with its 190,000 volume law library, as well as 5 professors and 23 students, moving to CBN University (now Regent University). Since the new CBN law school would not initially be accredited (and in fact did not receive provisional accreditation until 1989), students graduating in spring 1987 were allowed to state they graduated from Coburn, in order to be listed as graduating from an accredited school. U.S. Representative Michele Bachmann began attending Coburn the first year it opened, and graduated as part of its last class. Accreditation controversy In May 1981, the American Bar Association (ABA), which provides accreditation for US law schools, denied Coburn's initial application for provisional accreditation. Oral Roberts University's requirement that students must take an oath of religious faith was considered to be contrary to ABA's Standard 211, which states: The school sued the ABA, claiming that the denial was a violation of their First Amendment rights. A judge enjoined the ABA from denying provisional accreditation, ruling that the ABA's role in accreditation is equivalent to a \\"state action,\\" and that Standard 211 denied a private institution's right to freedom of religion without any restrictions by the state. After a \\"spirited debate,\\" the ABA's House of Delegates in August 1981 voted 147 to 127 to amend Standard 211 to add a clause including the phrase: Coburn was then granted provisional accreditation.

Left: the Eggetal The Egge, also called the Preu√üisch Oldendorfer Berg is a roughly seven-kilometre-long secondary ridge of the Wiehen Hills and gives its name to the Eggetal valley in the districts of Osnabr√ºck and Minden-L√ºbbecke in North Germany. The state border between North Rhine-Westphalia and Lower Saxony divides the ridge at a pass called the Durchbruch (\\"breakthrough\\") over which the road from Preu√üisch Oldendorf runs into the Eggetal and to Bruchm√ºhlen, about two-thirds of the Egge belonging to Westphalia. In addition to describing the entire ridge, in many maps the Egge is also shown as referring to a summit with a height of north of Eininghausen and eat of the Geisberg ; this usage is rare however. The section of the main crest of the Wiehen Hills between Neue M√ºhle and Horst H√∂he is referred in maps as Die Egge (\\"The Egge\\"). The ridge runs parallel to the main crest of the Wiehen at a distance of around two to three kilometres from it and between the villages of Lintorf in the borough of Bad Essen and Bad Holzhausen in the borough of Preu√üisch Oldendorf. The highest hill on the ridge is the 211-metre-high Schwarzer Brink in the west of the Egge. At the same time there is a parcel of arable land north of B√ºscherheide that, at 218 metres, is somewhat higher. The best-known hill on the Egge is the Limberg with its castle ruins of the same name that is situated in the far east of the ridge and is a popular tourist destination. Before it to the west is the Balkenkamp, a large, cleared upland over which runs a road link from the landwehr to the B 65 federal road to B√∂rninghausen. The steep northern slopes of the Eggen are predominantly forested; the woods cover an area of around 1,300 hectares. Whilst in the north the forest boundary extends as low as in places, the southern slopes with their more suitable gentler slopes enable their cultivation up to an average of around 150 metres and, in places, 200 metres. The Wiehen Tower near the state border is a well known observation tower. The eastern part of the Egge belongs to the Limberg und Offelter Berg Nature Reserve. The summits of the Egge have, like almost all the hills in the Wiehen, an elongated crest, which are also called Eggen like the peak of Gipfel Egge () north of Eininghausen. These Eggen are separated from one another only by hill passes called D√∂ren. The clearly defined crests may have derived their names for the formerly common description of Eggem meaning \\"selvage\\", the edge of a strip of linen. The pass above the town of Preu√üisch Oldendorf for the aforementioned north-south link, the Kreisstra√üe 79, is an artificial D√∂re, cut 9 metres deep into the rock.A photograph of the construction workers shows the deep cutting into the hard rock forming the Egge; the photograph was taken soon after the cutting was made all the way through on 1 June 1926.

In 2010, Coulton announced that he was about to start recording his first album in four years. Artificial Heart is a collaboration between Coulton and John Flansburgh, who encouraged Coulton to step outside the independent realm of his previous work and try many new things for the album, including recording with a full band in a professional studio. Thus, Artificial Heart is the first Coulton album to be produced by someone other than Coulton himself, the first to be recorded in a studio (owned by Flansburgh's collaborator Patrick Dillett), and the first to be written for (and recorded by) a full band. Artificial Heart is also the first Coulton album to feature guest lead vocals and a duet. Artificial Heart has become Coulton's first album to chart, placing #1 on Billboard's Heatseekers Albums, #26 on Billboard's Rock Albums, #16 on Billboard's Alternative Albums, and #125 on the Billboard 200.

Historical evidence suggests that it was probably the ancient and important Maya city known as Chetumal. Early history Evidence excavated at Santa Rita exhibits a long history of inhabitance. The discovery of a burial site containing very early pottery has dated the formation of the city between 2000 and 1200 BCE. Its importance peaked during the Postclassic era, and continued to be occupied even after the arrived of the Spanish. Because of its location, the city at Santa Rita once controlled nearby trade routes between the coast and the mouths of two major rivers, the R√≠o Hondo and R√≠o Nuevo. These rivers served as major arteries of trade to centres in the interior such as Lamanai and those in El Pet√©n. Because of this, it became the dominant settlement in the Chetumal region during the early Classic period. After a short decline during the Late Classic period, Santa Rita once again rose to prominence. Following the decline of Classic sites to the north, Chactemal (also known as Chetumal in some sources) became the capital of one of the 19 Mayan states later recorded by the invading Spanish. Chetumal formed part of the confederation of states under the Cocom dynasty of Mayap√°n. It remained under this alliance until 1441, when Mayap√°n supremacy was overthrown by an uprising. =Preclassic Period= The earliest indication of inhabitants at Santa Rita Corozal is dated to the Preclassic Period (1200-900 BCE). They lived upon a high bluff in the southwest area that overlooks Corozal Bay. Four burials were discovered with ceramics and shell jewelry dating from the Preclassic period. This early preclassic period had a small estimated population of 150. According to archaeological evidence, the middle preclassic period did not have an increase in population. The population appears to have grown in the Late Preclassic period. Twelve locations were identified as Late Preclassic sites. Thirty-four burials were found in these twelve locations. Included in the burials was Sierra Red pottery, which is found all over the Mayan Lowlands. The population was thought to be in the region of 1,000 people. The Protoclassic period, which is the temporal period between the Late Preclassic and Early Classic periods, is estimated by archaeologists to have increased in population again. Four burials have been dated to this time period.Chase, Diane Z. and Chase, Arlen F. (2004) \\"Santa Rita Corozal: Twenty Year Later\\" in Research Reports in Belizean Archaeology. 1: 243-255. =Classic Period= The Early Classic period had 1,500 residents who lived in a village that was much different than the earlier periods. Monuments were constructed and trades item were found, indicating that trade was increasing. Thirteen burials found from this time period indicate that an extensive social hierarchy was in place. Three of those thirteen burials were found in Structure 7, they had extravagant items not find in the other burials. Structure 7 is the tallest building at Santa Rita Corozal. One of these burials, which is dated to 450 A.D. contained what is thought to be a powerful ruler of Santa Rita Corozal. He was interred with items associated with the burial offerings of higher-ranked citizens. It is important to note that at this Early Classic time period, a distinct social structure had developed. The wealth found at the burials is thought to be due to trade along the rivers that border Santa Rita Corozal-the New River and the Rio Hondo. The Late Classic period is found throughout the site. It is estimated that by 750 A.D. nearly 2,500 residents were living at the site. Artifacts found throughout the site indicate that a large portion of the population had access to most items. The social hierarchy of the early Classic period had vanished. =Postclassic period= The excavations that lead to the discovery of Preclassic and Classic materials and burials were originally looking for information on Postclassic material. Thomas Gann's discovery of Postclassic murals, and excavations at Santa Rita Corozal would eventually lead researchers to Santa Rita Corozal in search of the Postclassic Maya. In 1979, a research project was developed to bring better understanding of the Postclassical Maya. It sought to identify the archaeological history of Santa Rita Corozal, to understand the origins and ending of the Postclassical period, and to comprehend the ritual, social and politics of the Late Postclassic period. At the time of its origin the Postclassic Maya were seen as a declining society that had abandoned its rituals, cities and were a shadow of their former splendor. Santa Rita Corozal did not decline into obscurity, quite the opposite occurred. Large buildings were not erected, but low lying buildings were constructed. By the Late Postclassic period Santa Rita Corozal had its highest number of inhabitants. The population at 1300-1539 CE was estimated to be at 6,900 residents. Excavations were undertaken in 1985, in the south central area of Santa Rita Corozal. Nine buildings were found that were constructed in the Postclassic period. Most of them were built over earlier buildings. The artifacts found in two structures, Structures 183 and 213, both contained figure artifacts. Structure 213 contained 25 figures that were placed in the ground prior to its construction. Nine of the figures were put into a ceramic urn with the remaining sixteen figurines surrounding it. Structure 183 contained 28 figurines that were placed into a ceramic urn in front of an altar.Chase, Diane Z. Chase, Arlen F. (1986) \\"Offerings to the Gods: Maya Archaeology at Santa Rita Corozal\\", University of Central Florida, Orlando. Drawing of one of the Santa Rita murals by Thomas Gann (1900) Excavation The modern town of Corozal was founded in 1848 by refugees from the Caste War in neighbouring Yucat√°n, and expanded steadily making it the major ethnicity in the country at the time. The ruins of Santa Rita became a target for building resources; the mounds of the site made convenient road fill and the stones were used for structure foundations. Because of this, the exact borders of the ancient Mayan city may never be known. In the early 1900s, amateur archaeologist Thomas Gann visited the site and discovered a Mixtec-influenced mural; these do not survive, but copies made by Gann do. No substantial research followed this until the Corozal Postclassic Project, led by Arlen Chase and Diane Zaino Chase, carried out a series of excavations between 1979 and 1985. Little structural evidence remains from the Postclassic era. The only existing structure at the ruins dates from the Classic era. The centre of this building has been described as a ceremonial chamber, with a complex series of interconnected passages leading to other rooms, including two burial chambers. One contained the remains an elderly woman surrounded with jewellery and pottery; the other was that of a warlord, evident from the artefacts found buried with him ‚Äî a ceremonial flint representing leadership and a stingray spine most used in blood-letting rituals. Both burials date from around 500 CE. According to a Belize government guide at the site in December 2016, Thomas Gann was there primarily looking for gold. He used explosives to blow the top off of the pyramid, leaving the stunted version visible today. Artifacts found dating from the Postclassic era reveal that religious rituals like blood-letting, which were very important during the Classic era, continued to play an important role. The presence of items of Aztec origin, also dating from the Postclassic period, attest to the continuing trade importance of Santa Rita several hundred years after the decline of the major ceremonial centres of the interior.

Azad rose to power between 1752 and 1757, and controlled part of the Azerbaijan region up to Urmia city, northwestern and northern Persia, and parts of southwestern Turkmenistan and eastern Kurdistan. Azad was a contemporary of Ahmad Shah Durrani, the founder of the Durrani Empire. Early life career Azad was born in Andar town in the east of Ghazni, Afghanistan, into the Andar clan of the Ghilji Pashtun confederacy. He joined Nader Shah's army around 1738 and took part in his campaigns in India and Iran. At the time of Nader's murder, he was second-in-command to Amir Aslan Khan Qerglu Afshar, the governor of Azerbaijan. Rise to power Azad played a prominent role in the power struggle that followed the death of Nader. He quickly defected Aslan Khan to Nader's nephew and would-be successor, Ebrahim Mirza, and earned for himself the title of khan. In 1749, Ebrahim was himself defeated by Nader's grandson, Shahrukh Shah, Azad Khan attached himself and his Afghan cavalry to Mƒ´r Sayyed Mo·∏•ammad, the superintendent of the shrine at Mashhad, following whose orders he withdrew to the western marches of Iran. He continued to be involved in the unrest in Iran and, through a series of alliance with local Kurd and Turkish chieftains and a policy of compromise with the Georgian ruler Erekle II, Azad rose to control all the territory between Ardabil and Urmia by 1752. Mohur of Azad Shah Afghan Downfall Azad, defeated in the battle of Kirkhbulakh, failed to gain the lands north of the Aras due to the Georgian power, but succeeded, in 1753, to annex the central Zagros provinces. He was going to unite his forces with the Bakhtiari leader Ali-Mardan Khan, advancing from Baghdad against the de facto regent of western Iran, Karim Khan of the Zand clan, but the union was prevented by Karim victory over Ali-Mardan Khan. Azad Khan had to retreat, but inflicted a heavy defeat upon the pursuing Zand army and then took Karim's home fortress of Pari, near Malayer. In 1754, Azad, allied with the Afshar chief Fath-Ali Khan, attacked Karim at Qomesa and occupied Shiraz, driving him to Kazerun. The Zands eventually defeated Fath-Ali Khan and took Shiraz on 29 November 1754, marking the reversal of Azad's fortunes. By June 1757, he had lost Isfahan, Tabriz, and Urmia to the resurgent Qajars of Mazandaran under Mohammad Hasan Khan. Azad fled to Baghdad and, following a failed attempt at comeback, took refuge at the court of Erekle II in Tbilisi, Georgia, in 1760. In 1762, he surrendered himself to victorious Karim Khan, by that time the master of all of northern Iran, and ended his days as Karim's honored pensioner in Shiraz. Azad died in 1781 and, in accordance with his will, was interred in his native lands, in Kabul, many hundreds of miles to the east.

It is the site of the Union Pacific Railroad's (UP) Hinkle Locomotive Service and Repair Facility, part of the Hinkle Freight Classification Yard. History The former Hinkle Amtrak station, September 1982 Hinkle was a railway junction where a cutoff to Boardman rejoined the main line of the Oregon Railway & Navigation Company that ran from Umatilla to Huntington. When the cutoff was built in 1915, a station was needed at the junction with the main line, and Joseph T. Hinkle, a prominent local attorney, newspaper editor and politician, sold the railroad a small amount of land for that purpose. The station was named in his honor. According to the compilers of Oregon Geographic Names, the community of Hinkle \\"languished in obscurity for a third of a century\\", until 1951, when the completion of the McNary Dam flooded the former route of the UP's line. When the tracks were relocated, UP built a major yard at the junction, expanding it beginning in 1976. From 1977 until 1997, Hinkle was a passenger stop on Amtrak's Pioneer route; the station code was HIK. Hinkle was previously a stop on the UP's City of Portland route, with connections to Chicago.

The Italianate style house was completed in 1860 for Charles and Caroline Richards. It is a contributing property to the De Tonti Square Historic District, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 7, 1972. The four Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) chapters in Mobile jointly operate and maintain the house. It is noted by architectural historians as one of Mobile's best preserved and elaborate examples of mid-19th century domestic architecture. History The house was built in 1860 for Charles G. Richards, a steamboat captain, and his wife, Caroline Elizabeth Steele. It remained in their family until 1946, when it was purchased by the Ideal Cement Company. That company renovated it for office use in 1947. It was turned over to the city of Mobile in 1973, which then leased it to the Daughters of the American Revolution for operation as a museum. Architecture The exterior of the two-story brick house is Italianate in style. The rectangular main block is offset at the rear with semi-octagonal bays. It features an elaborate cast iron veranda, with allegorical figures representing the four seasons, across the three bays of the main front elevation. The deck of the veranda is marble and granite. Bracketed cornices and paneled soffits at the roof line are topped by a shallow hipped roof. The interior is divided on a side-hall plan. Notable ornamental features are a curved staircase, marble mantels, the original bronze chandeliers, and floor-length windows overlooking the veranda.

He settled in Boston and Portsmouth before settling Newport, but later returned to Portsmouth. His descendants include Commodores Oliver Hazard Perry and Matthew C. Perry and three colonial Rhode Island deputy governors.  Life  Thomas Hazard was a founding settler of Newport, Rhode Island, who, upon arriving from England, first settled in Boston, and then came to Portsmouth before settling in Newport. Moriarity suggested that he had come from Dorsetshire, England, but Anderson concluded there is insufficient evidence for this assertion. He was a ship carpenter, and was in Boston in the Massachusetts Bay Colony as early as 1635, and admitted to the church there on 22 May 1636. He was made a freeman of Boston in 1636, but by 1638 he was admitted as an inhabitant of Portsmouth on Aquidneck Island, where many followers of Anne Hutchinson had settled. On 28 April 1639, he and eight others signed a compact, and soon established the town of Newport at the southern end of Aquidneck Island. Once there, he was named as one of four assigned to proportion the land, and to collect four pence for each acre laid out. In September he was made a freeman of Newport, and the following March was a member of the general court of elections. On 20 June 1644 he sold to Henry Bull certain parcels of land that had been granted to him by the freemen of Newport. In 1655 Hazard was once again in Portsmouth, where his name appears on a list of freemen, and where, in 1658, he deeded land to Stephen Wilcox, who married his daughter Hannah. The same year he was chosen to sit on the colony's petit jury, but was fined five shillings for not serving. Hazard wrote a will on 30 November 1669, naming his son and his three married daughters. His circumstances later changed, and on 13 November 1676 he wrote another will with much different provisions (see Family, below). He was still alive on 6 August 1677 when he further modified his estate plans. Austin has him paying a tax in 1680, but Anderson does not find this to be valid.  Family  Hazard first married a woman named Martha, about whom little is known. Based on the probable birth dates of his children, his wife and at least two children likely sailed with him from England to New England. Hazard had a friendly relationship with Thomas Sheriff of Portsmouth, and when the latter died, Hazard married, as his second wife, Sheriff's widow, also named Martha. In his first will in 1669, Hazard made his son executor, and named all three daughters, but in his later will, his son and daughters were disinherited, with all of his estate going to his \\"beloved yoakfellow Martha Hassard now living.\\" Following Hazard's death, his widow then married Lewis Hues, who abandoned her within a few weeks, apparently \\"taking away great part of her estate, that was hers in her former husband's time.\\" Of Hazard's four known children, Robert married Mary Brownell; Elizabeth married George Lawton; Hannah married Stephen Wilcox; and Martha married first Ichabod Potter, and later married Benjamin Mowry. Hazard's great grandson, George Hazard was the deputy governor of the Rhode Island colony from 1734 to 1738, and his great grandson Robert Hazard was the deputy governor from 1750 to 1751. Colonial deputy governor Jonathan Nichols, Jr., and the first Chief Justice of the Rhode Island Supreme Court, Gideon Cornell were descendants, as were the brothers, Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry and Commodore Matthew C. Perry. Most early writers on the family suggest that Hazard was the same person as a Thomas Hazard living in Newtown on Long Island, but Anderson presents strong evidence that the two are different men. See also * List of early settlers of Rhode Island * Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations References a. Austin cites an unknown source from 1674 in which Hazard calls himself aged 64. However, Anderson points out that his son, Robert, had to have been born by 1628, making a 1610 birth year improbable for the elder Hazard, and likely that his birth was several years earlier. = Bibliography =  External links 1610 births Year of death unknown Kingdom of England emigrants to the Thirteen Colonies People from Portsmouth, Rhode Island People from Newport, Rhode Island People of colonial Rhode Island ","title":"Thomas Hazard"},{"id":"32736346","text":"Safford Cape (28 June 1906 - 26 March 1973) was an American conductor, composer and musicologist.

She first received acclaim in the 1970s as a muralist. In her long career as a studio artist her artistic practice as centered on works-on-paper, principally pastels, which frequently incorporate indigenist imagery and the social- political tension of gender roles. Hern√°ndez has lived both in Chicago, Illinois and Los Angeles. In 1974, she became the fifth member, and only woman, in Los Four, the influential and celebrated East Los Angeles Chicano artist collective, along with Carlos Almaraz, Frank E. Romero, Robert de la Rocha, and Gilbert Luj√°n. As early as 1970, Hern√°ndez was involved in the initial efforts of Chicano artists in East Los Angeles to organize. Of this experience, Hern√°ndez later said that \\"Often I was literally the only female at meetings who was not a girlfriend or wife, but an active artist participant.\\"  Early life and education  1981 ‚Äì Judithe Hern√°ndez painting at the \\"Murals of Aztlan exhibition, CAFAM, Los Angeles, CA In 1965, Hern√°ndez became the first student to win the \\"Future Masters Scholarship\\" (awarded at LACMA and funded by the Sears & Roebuck Foundation and the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce) which enabled her to attend Otis Art Institute (now called Otis College of Art and Design) in Los Angeles. In 1972, after earning a B.F.A. at Otis, she began graduate studies there. When Carlos Almaraz enrolled in the graduate program that year, it marked the beginning of a long friendship and professional association as members of Los Four. Inspired by recent events such as the 1968 East LA student walkouts, she, along with Almaraz, became involved in the Chicano civil-rights movement and worked on such projects as the Chicano Moratorium Against the War. During her time at Otis, Hern√°ndez studied drawing with the renowned African-American artist Charles White who became a mentor and important influence on her development as an artist. In the late 1940s, White, had traveled to Mexico to print with Taller de Grafica Popular in Mexico City and became an admirer of indigenous and Latin American art. Hern√°ndez attributes much of her success to the teachers and professors who recognized her ability and encouraged her to pursue her career as an artist. In 1971, while working as the illustrator of the Aztl√°n Journal, published by the UCLA Chicano Studies Research Center, Hern√°ndez illustrated the first volume of poetry by the celebrated Mexican-American poet Alurista, Floricanto en Aztl√°n. In 2013, the 40th anniversary edition of Floricanto received three prizes at the International Latino Book awards.  Career  After earning M.F.A.'s at Otis College, she and Almaraz collaborated with El Teatro Campesino, worked on behalf of the United Farm Workers, and as members of the Concilio de Arte Popular (CAP), they worked to create an organization that united Chicano artists across the state of California. Chicano artist organizations such as the Royal Chicano Air Force of Sacramento; Galeria de la Raza, in San Francisco, and the artists of Chicano Park in San Diego were among those who participated in CAP in the 1970s. In 1981, she and seven other Chicano muralists painted murals inside the Craft and Folk Art Museum in Los Angeles for an exhibition entitled The Murals of Aztl√°n. The artists were criticized in Artweek by reviewer Shifra Goldman for \\"shedding ‚Ä¶ their cultural identity and political militance\\" in order to \\"enter the mainstream as competitive professionals.\\" Hern√°ndez responded \\"why should changes in my work and socio-political attitudes be construed as compromising my commitment ‚Ä¶ while in another artist the same would be construed as personal and professional growth?\\" The international significance of her work came in 1989 with the first exhibition of Chicano art in Europe, Les D√©mon des Anges. Hern√°ndez was one of sixteen artists (one of three women) whose work was part of this ground-breaking exhibition. In the early 1980s Hern√°ndez relocated to Chicago and lived there for more than 25 years before returning to Los Angeles in 2010. Her final exhibition in Chicago was a major solo exhibition of new work at the National Museum of Mexican Art. La Vida Sobre Papel, opened in January 2011 and included several new series of work, one of which was the noted serial murders of women in Ciudad Ju√°rez. According to the Chicago Weekly, \\"The only thing as conspicuous as the artist's skill is her message: being human is hard, a woman harder, and life as a Latina occasionally downright grisly.\\" Hernandez says she will continue working on the series until the 800-2000 deaths are acknowledged by the Mexican government. In 2011, Hern√°ndez was among a select group of artists whose contributions to the art of Los Angeles were honored in multiple exhibitions which were part of the sweeping arts initiative known as Pacific Standard Time: Art in L.A., 1945‚Äì1980 (PST), funded by the Getty Foundation. In 2012 Hern√°ndez was the recipient of two major awards; the prestigious C.O.L.A. Fellowship (City of Los Angeles Individual Artist Fellowship) for 2013, as well as the coveted commission to create public art for the Terminus Station of Metro EXPO LINE at Colorado & 4th Street in Santa Monica by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority of Los Angeles. The Expo Line Downtown Santa Monica station opened on May 20, 2016. \\"The station at the edge of the continent\\" features 24 mosaic glass panels designed by Hern√°ndez positioned over its two-passenger platforms. Collectively, the panels are known at \\"L.A. Sonata\\" and depict the passage of the day and the seasons using a montage of cultural icons representing the cultural and ethnic diversity of Los Angeles. It is expected to be one of the most traveled light-rail lines in the U.S. In 2013, Hern√°ndez was one of 72 artists chosen for the first major exhibition of contemporary American artists of Latino descent at the Smithsonian American Art Museum from works in their permanent collection. \\"Our America: The Latino Presence in American Art\\" opened in October 2013. After closing in January 2014, the exhibition traveled to several other museums throughout the United States, including the Crocker Museum in California, the Utah Museum of Fine Arts in Salt Lake City, and the Hunter Museum of Art in Tennessee. In 2017, Hern√°ndez will again have work in multiple exhibitions of the Getty Foundation sponsored Pacific Standard Time LA/LA which explores the influence of Latin American art on the art of Los Angeles. Her work \\"The Purification\\" was selected as a featured promotional image for PST LA/LA. Over her 50-year career, she has established a significant record of exhibition and acquisition of her work by major public and private collections; which include the Museum of Modern Art, Smithsonian American Art Museum, the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Art, the National Museum of Mexican Art, the Museum of Latin American Art, the Crocker Art Museum, the Gerald Buck Collection, and the Bank of America. She has been the recipient of the prestigious University of Chicago Artist-in-Residence at the Center for the Study of Race, Politics, & Culture, the C.O.L.A. Fellowship, and the Comisi√≥n Femenil Mexicana Nacional Award for Achievement in the Fine Arts. In 2018, the importance of her status as an American artist was confirmed when the Pulitzer Prize winning Chief Art Critic of the Los Angeles, Christopher Knight, reviewed her solo exhibition at MOLAA and wrote \\"...Hern√°ndez‚Äôs art is churned by her marvelous color sense, which unmoors any illustrative limits of the genre.\\" https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-et-cm-judithe-hernandez- molaa-20180918-story.html In 2018, Hern√°ndez was honored by the National Museum of Mexican Art in Chicago with the Sor Juana Legacy Award for \\"outstanding lifetime contributions to arts\\" and in August she will become the first American-born Latina to open a solo exhibition at the Museum of Latin American Art. Also in 2018, her work \\"La Virgen del la Oscuridad\\" will become the featured image of the newly redesigned permanent exhibition \\"Becoming Los Angeles\\" of the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County which re-opens in May. In 2019, her newest mural commission marks the return of her artistic presence to the historic district of downtown Los Angeles when her seven-story mural \\"La Nueva Reina de Los Angeles\\" is installed on the northwest residential tower of La Plaza Village at Broadway and the Hollywood Freeway.

The Institute conducts research into rare congenital metabolic illnesses such as Fabry's disease and Gaucher's disease. It enjoys worldwide recognition as a diagnostic and treatment center for rare illnesses. Its stated area of research is neuroregeneration, the regrowth or repair of nervous tissues and cells. The Institute is named for Albrecht Kossel, noted German biochemist, 1910 Nobel laureate in Physiology or Medicine, and graduate of the university. Sifap In 2007, the Institute initiated Sifap, a Pan-European study dedicated to investigating the correlation of juvenile stroke and a genetic disorder known as Fabry's disease. The Institute will engage in professional cooperation with international partners in the fields of economics, science and research. The expected results are an improved understanding into the nature of juvenile stroke, and improvement in its therapeutic treatment. Education and research The Institute works in close cooperation with national and international universities in the context of scientific cooperatives. The institute participates in LEUKONET, the German Leukodystrophy network, which is run by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research.

She was the final barge to leave that surviving main boatyard on the river. She did so in 1966 and is on the National Register of Historic Ships under registration number 2080, outside of the National Historic Fleet. History Perseverance IV was built in 1934 by G J V Edwards and Sons at Dapdune Wharf, Guildford ‚Äì the tenth of eleven Wey barges made by the company. The barge was built for the then owners of the Wey Navigation, William Stevens & Sons, and carried bulk wheat between the London Docklands and Coxes Lock Mill, Addlestone. After more than thirty years working the route, she was rebuilt at Dapdune Wharf from 1964 to 1966. She then went back into service, before being sold to another owner who used her as a cable-laying barge on the Regents Canal, where she ended her working life in 1982. In 1982, she came under the ownership of the Museum of London, and was rebuilt further times: in 1986/87 and 1998. She is one of only three remaining Wey barges in the world, and is the only floating example - the Reliance is permanently damaged and in a drydock at Dapdune Wharf, whereas Speedwell is in poor condition at the National Waterways Museum in Ellesmere Port. In future, the National Trust hope to use the barge for public boat trips up and down the Navigations. Unfortunately, due to a lack of annual maintenance, she needs repair, and is ¬£10,000 per year to maintain. Consequently, the National Trust launched a 2011 appeal to raise ¬£200,000 for the purchase and ¬£300,000 for years of restoration.

Various petroleum businesses operate there, and the city has become a place to seek employment and economic security for many Algerians, which was in the midst of a civil war. This has led to the development of many bidonvilles (shantytowns) around the city. Many women have migrated to Hassi Messaoud to find employment doing maintenance tasks, secretarial work or in catering in the petroleum companies. Such women work, but also live alone, in a very traditional region. Islamic preachers have accused themChronique de Caroline Fourest du 7 mai 2010, France Culture of having a \\"second job\\", i.e. working as prostitutes by night in addition to their day jobs, in a region with a high unemployment rate among men.http://www.algerie- dz.com/article1632.html L'autre face de Hassi Messaoud Before the mob violence, many women had been the object of insults, and some had been physically threatened.http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/monde/afrique/la-nuit- de-la-haine_848559.html La Nuit de la Haine, L'Express  First incident  During the day of prayer on Friday, July 13, 2001 an imam described as fundamentalist, Amar Taleb, verbally attacked the women coming from the regions of the northwest to work in the petroleum companies, inciting the men in attendance to commit violent acts against them. He accused them of \\"immoral\\" behaviour, calling for a \\"Jihad against the devil\\" in order to \\"hunt down fornicating women\\".¬´ jihad against El Fassal ¬ª, in La Tribune, ‚ÄúL'escalade √† Hassi Messaoud‚Äù, Youcef Rezzoug According to him, women living alone, without a wali, (a male guardian according to the Maliki tradition), could only be prostitutes. During the night of 13 to 14 July, around 10 PM, a mob of around 300 men moved in the direction of the bidonville El-Ha√Øcha, where women working as housecleaners, cooks and secretaries lived. Over the course of five hours, 40 women in the area were attacked, beaten, raped, mutilated, and dragged through the street naked. Their homes were looted and some were burnt. Some of the attackers were armed with knives.http://www.wluml.org/fr/node/639#_ftn4 Algeria: Attacks on women in Hassi Messaoud The police did not arrive until 3 AM, putting an end to the violence. This was repeated the following night, and then on July 16 it was repeated in other neighborhoods of the city. On July 17, then on July 23 and 24, the violence spread to the city of Tebessa, then further south where businesses owned by lone women were vandalized. Dozens of women were hospitalized, six in critical condition.https://www.humanite.fr/2001-07-18_International_Epouvante-a-Hassi- Messaoud There were 95 women and children who found refuge in a youth hostel. Others hired taxis to leave the city and return to their region of origin. Three of the young women who were raped were virgins at the time of the incidents. The newspaper La Tribune wrote of four to six deaths, which authorities denied. Witnesses described seeing several dead women. In August 2001, the association SOS Femmes en d√©tresse spoke of woman killed by an attack, and three who remained hospitalizedhttp://sosfemmesendetresse.org/article.php3?id_article=32 Hassi Messaoud, juillet 2001  The trials  According to newspaper La Tribune, imam Amar Taleb was arrested, as well as 40 men who took part in the violence. Le Matin confirmed 9 arrests. Amar Taleb, however, continues to preach in the largest mosque in the city. Thirty-nine women decided to file charges. In the first instance, in June 2004, none of the victims were able to have recourse to a lawyer, not even those who were promised by the Ministry of Solidarity. Most of the charges against the 32 attackers were deemed waived, retaining only \\"the mob in the street and public order offenses\\".http://www.elwatan.com/Femmes-battues-a-Hassi-Messaoud El Watan, 2 juillet 2004 The appeal process began in December 2004, but was postponed to 2005, at the court of Biskra, to allow all of those accused to be present in court.http://www.algeria-watch.org/fr/article/femmes/femmes_hassi_messaoud.htm Alg√©ria Watch: affaire des femmes agress√©es At the reopening of the trial, only six of the accused were present, facing three victims. Under pressure and threats (including even within the courtroom during the first trial) the other women abandoned their lawsuits. Prison sentences of eight, six and three years were delivered to the three accused who were present, and the three others were acquitted. Most of the attackers were sentenced in absentia: 20 were sentenced to 20 years, 4 were sentenced to 10 years and one was sentenced to five years. However, only three had to serve their sentences. = Continuing attacks = As of 2011, similar mob attacks against women continued in Hassi Messaoud and elsewhere in Algeria, notably M'sila.

The arc spanned the five \\"Super Special #1\\" editions of the Spider-Man titles available at the time: The Amazing Spider-Man, Spider-Man, The Spectacular Spider-Man, Venom, and Web of Spider-Man. The plot continued a narrative first published in the four-part limited series Venom: Separation Anxiety (1994) where doubt is placed in the mind of Eddie Brock about who is in control of the relationship between himself and the sentient Venom symbiote that grants him his powers. The story centers on the invasion of Earth by an army of symbiotes and the efforts of Venom, Spider-Man, and Scarlet Spider to stop them. Story Starting in the one-shot comic The Amazing Spider-Man Super Special #1 (April 1995),The Amazing Spider-Man Super Special #1 at the Grand Comics Database Eddie Brock contemplates his relationship with the Venom symbiote after Venom's spawn Phage, Riot, Lasher, Agony, and Scream struggle to control themselves against their own symbiotes. While teamed with Spider-Man against a terrorist group, Brock realizes the symbiote is influencing him to kill. Spider-Man attempts to convince Eddie to abandon the symbiote by blaming it for Brock's insanity. Brock forces the symbiote to leave him, to allow him to think about the situation uninfluenced. Angry at being rejected, the symbiote unleashes a powerful, telepathic scream that draws a spaceship of other symbiotes to Earth. Continuing in the same issue, the symbiotes begin possessing random civilians and committing murders. Brock, believing his symbiote is to blame, teams with Spider-Man and the Scarlet Spider to investigate. They eventually discover the symbiotes are creating a massive machine out of stolen Earth components. The three engage the symbiotes but find themselves overwhelmed. Scarlet Spider is revealed to be wearing a symbiote, which drags all three through the machine. Following part 2 in the one-shot Spider-Man Super Special #1 (July 1995),Spider-Man Super Special #1 at the Grand Comics Database the one-shot Venom Super Special #1 (Aug. 1995),Venom Super Special #1 at the Grand Comics Database finds the three on another planet, a world conquered by the symbiotes, the machine revealed to be a teleporter. The symbiote that had bonded with the Scarlet Spider is revealed to be Venom, who again bonds with Brock. Venom conveys the history of the symbiotes as a race of creatures intent on taking over host bodies from other races in order to feel emotion. The Venom symbiote was considered an aberration for wanting to bond with a host instead of dominating them. Venom also reveals the symbiotes intend to conquer Earth next. Spider-Man, the Scarlet Spider and Venom escape through the teleporter to Earth, but are followed by the symbiote invasion force. The Spectacular Spider-Man Super Special #1 (Sept. 1995)The Spectacular Spider-Man Super Special #1 at the Grand Comics Database continues the story with a symbiote releasing from prison the serial killer Cletus Kasady, unleashing the bonded symbiote that makes Kasady the supervillain Carnage. Carnage absorbs the second symbiote and becomes stronger as a result. Spider-Man, Scarlet Spider and Venom launch an assault against the symbiote invaders but are overwhelmed. As they are about to be defeated, Carnage appears, having grown to building-size proportions by consuming symbiotes. The conclusion in Web of Spider-Man Super Special #1 (Oct. 1995)https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Web_of_Spider- Man_Super_Special_Vol_1_1 finds Carnage seeking out Venom to kill him. Spider- Man and Scarlet Spider fight Carnage while Venom attempts to create a more powerful telekinetic scream to subdue the symbiotes. Spider-Man and Scarlet Spider defeat Carnage and Brock fully bonds with his symbiote to create the necessary scream. The scream creates enough pain and despair that the symbiotes commit suicide. Venom decides he is content to be both Brock and the symbiote. Collected edition A trade paperback book collecting the story arc was released in August 2018 under the title Venom: Planet of the Symbiotes. In other media Planet of the Symbiotes is one of the two storylines that serves as the primary inspiration for the 2018 film Venom (alongside Lethal Protector). Planet of the Symbiotes is adapted as the eighteenth Spec-Ops Mission of Marvel: Avengers Alliance. Planet of the Symbiotes also served as the inspiration of Spider-Man: Maximum Venom.

The establishment, Ovejero Hermanos, was incorporated as Ingenio Ledesma (Ledesma Plantation) in 1889, and as Compa√±√≠a Azucarera Ledesma in 1908.

He became the namesake of the Ledesma River and the Ledesma Department, as well. Enrique Wollmann and Carlos Delcasse purchased the company in 1911, subsequently investing in technology and in increasing production capacity. Herminio Arrieta became president of the company in 1927. He fostered the growth of the company's sugar business by increasing land area under production and adding two sugar mills. Arrieta also diversified the company, establishing a cellulose and paper plant based on insourced sugar cane fiber. The company was reincorporated under its present name in 1956. Dr. Carlos Pedro Blaquier became president of the company in 1970. Blaquier's tenure was distinguished by a marked diversification in the company's interests.

It lies along the B4419 and B4421 roads, north of Dwyran, south of Gaerwen and northwest of Llanidan. It is named after Caffo, a 6th-century saint. A church, St Caffo's Church, is named after him. A war memorial, a village hall and a primary school are also located in the village. The 1851 census recorded 138 people in the village, 75 males, 63 females and a parish area of . It is in the community of Rhosyr. Geography B4421 at Llangaffo Entering Llangaffo from the direction of Newborough Llangaffo is a parish in the hundred of Menai, county Anglesey. It is located northwest of Caernarfon and south of Llangefni. It is in the vicinity of the North Wales Coast Line, although the nearest station (Gaerwen railway station) closed in 1966. The village is situated on a vantage hill ridge that provides vistas of pastureland and the hills of Snowdonia and the Menai Strait. The Snowdonian mountains terminate in the west with the abrupt precipices of Yr Eifl. It covers an extensive tract of land, of which a large portion is marshy, some part hilly, and the remainder in a fair state of cultivation. In 1790, an act of parliament was obtained for more effectually embanking the marshes called Malltraeth and Corsddeuga, under the provisions of which were allotted to the several proprietors of land in this parish. The soil is in general fertile, and the lower grounds afford excellent pasturage for cattle. The surrounding scenery is varied, while the higher grounds afford vistas over the adjacent countryside. Mats are manufactured from the seaweed extracted from the marshy area. It is in the community of Rhosyr. St Caffo's Church St Caffo's Church was constructed in 1846 to replace the previous medieval church on the site. The new building includes a number of monuments from the old church, and has a spire which is a prominent local landmark. The churchyard has part of a stone cross dating from the 9th or 10th century, and some gravestones from the 9th to 11th centuries. It is dedicated to St Caffo, a 6th-century martyr who was killed in the vicinity. The church is still in use as part of the Church in Wales, one of four churches in a combined parish. It is a Grade II listed building, a designation given to \\"buildings of special interest, which warrant every effort being made to preserve them\\", in particular because it is regarded as \\"a mid 19th-century rural church, consistently articulated and detailed in an Early English style\\". The lintel of the church's northern doorway consists of a tomb-stone long, bearing a poorly-incised cross, plain and with the arms gradually widened. In the churchyard, there is a mutilated cross on a crude pedestal, now used as a sundial, on the front of which is sculptured a cross with equal limbs, each dilated at the extremity, inscribed within a circle, beneath which are two incised trefoils. The edge of the stone is ornamented with the classical fret seen on the Penmon Priory stones and cross. The carving is defaced and difficult to make out. A wheel head, an early Christian monument, has also been found at the church. The lower half of the wheel is triple- beaded and of Celtic-style, the head contains arm ends in square or hammer shaped style, while the detailing on the cross arms includes raised mouldings. War Memorial Llangaffo =Grounds= Gravestones with carvings of cross are seen in the churchyard and one of them is of 7th-century vintage. A war memorial in the churchyard, commemorates the names of Llangaffo residents who were killed or missing in World War I and World War II. Landmarks In the parish are slight remains of Bodwyr, an old house of the 16th century, now part of a farm and bed and breakfast. The primary school is Ysgol Llangaffo (\\"Llangaffo School\\"), opened in 1854, and located along the main road in the heart of the village. Archaeology Two gold coins of the Emperor Constantine, in a good state of preservation, were found near the church, in the year 1829, and several silver and copper coins of that and other emperors have been found in the parish. Small concentrations of stone have been found around Llangaffo, possibly indicating stone cutter activity that under monastic direction.

The tour then proceeds to leave with a large caravan of camels being used as transportation. Porky then comes running out and chases after the caravan; but he is too late and ends up not being able to catch up to them. He sees an available camel called Humpty Bumpty however, and takes it with the intent of seeing the pyramids, but he ends up lost in the desert and eventually him and weirdly enough, the camel start to suffer from dehydration. They start seeing various mirages that cause them to go into a dreamlike sequence where Porky and the camel both hallucinate and hear strange voices. The camel then starts acting weird and Porky tries to calm him down, but fails, and the camel grows more and more insane. Eventually, they run screaming from the desert and back into the town, whereupon they lock themselves inside a safehouse. Humpty believes that they are safe, but Porky is then shown to have similarly lost his mind as he begins laughing hysterically, puts on an oversized bicorne hat with the letter N on it (an obvious allusion to Napoleon), and starts dancing in an exaggerated, chaotic fashion as the cartoon irises out.

Jason was originally portrayed by Steve Burton, and role was recast by Billy Miller.On December 1, 2017, it was revealed that Miller's character was Jason identical twin brother Andrew Cain brainwashed into believing he was Jason. Elizabeth is portrayed by Rebecca Herbst. Casting Steve Burton first appeared in the role of Jason in December 1991, becoming the third actor to play the character since it was first introduced in 1983. Rebecca Herbst originated the role of Elizabeth on August 1, 1997. Burton left show in January 2000, and made various guest appearances before returning full-time in May 2002. Burton's return stopped the show's casting call for a potential love interest for Elizabeth, causing speculation that Elizabeth and Jason would become a couple. Herbst denied rumors of her departure in April 2002, stating on her website that Burton's return would affect her storyline. In August 2009, Burton re- signed his contract after weeks of speculation that he might leave the series, and openly took a pay cut due to the declining economic climate. On January 18, 2011, ABC Daytime announced that Herbst had been let go from General Hospital and her exit would be storyline dictated. Burton was one of many costars to speak out about Herbst's firing, stating: \\"Most of you have heard the horrible and awful news about Becky. My heart breaks as I even have to tweet this. One of the best and most beautiful actresses that has been on this show. Beside that, she's a friend and that hurts. Some show will be lucky to have her. May god bless them through this transition.\\" After much fan protest, a month after the original announcement, ABC released another statement saying that Herbst would retain her role on the show. Herbst renewed her contract in March 2012. Burton extended his contract in May 2011 for one year, and announced his departure in August 2012, staying long enough for his character to be written out of the series. In September 2014, it was announced that actor Billy Miller, known for his roles on All My Children and The Young & the Restless, would be taking over the role of Jason. Storyline In the summer of 1999, Elizabeth is reeling from the death of her first love, Lucky Spencer (then Jonathan Jackson), when she finds a friend in Jason. He helps her cope with her pain and they form a bond. When Jason is shot, Elizabeth takes him to her studio apartment and helps him recover. Later, Jason rescues Liz from Joseph Sorel (Joe Marinelli)'s bomb, which had been placed in her studio. Jason realizes that his friendship with Liz is putting her in danger and he leaves Port Charles, leaving Liz devastated. Soon after, Lucky (then Jacob Young) is revealed to be alive, but his relationship with Elizabeth struggles due to him having been brainwashed. Jason returns to town, and he and Liz reconnect, despite Lucky's disapproval. When Liz is kidnapped by Sorel's men, Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard), Jason and Zander Smith (Chad Brannon) work together to rescue her. Jason notices the growing closeness between Liz and Zander, and gets a little jealous. When Sonny puts a hit out on Zander, at Elizabeth‚Äôs request, Jason allows him to hide out at his penthouse. Jason and Liz would try to make their relationship work, but decide to wait until Zander leaves before they are intimate. However, Elizabeth breaks things off with Jason after learning that Jason faked Sonny's death and kept it from her, putting her through unnecessary pain, and causing her to realize Jason's \\"world\\" was not one she wanted to be a part of. Despite multiple attempts to reconcile with Liz, all of which she rebuffed, Jason moved on and began dating Sonny's sister, Courtney Matthews (Alicia Leigh Willis). Liz was furious, as she still loved Jason in spite of pushing him away. She accused Courtney of wanting Jason to herself throughout their short-lived friendship. Jason and Courtney married, and Liz married Ric Lansing (Rick Hearst), Sonny's brother. Ric genuinely loved Liz, but his resentment of his brother, and growing resentment and jealousy of the role Jason played in Sonny's life, resulted in Ric committing horrible acts, including kidnapping Sonny's pregnant wife, Carly (then Tamara Braun), and hiding her in a panic room in his home with Liz. During this period, Liz defended Ric, unaware of his actions, despite Jason's attempts at warning her. The two rekindled their friendship while Jason's sister and Liz's best friend, Emily Quartermaine (Natalia Livingston), was believed to be dying of cancer. This caused a great deal of jealousy from Courtney and Ric, who were threatened by the bond Liz and Jason still shared. Combined with grief over a miscarriage, Courtney turned to painkillers, resulting in an unintentional hit and run that temporarily blinded Elizabeth. Liz eventually divorced Ric over his actions, and Jason and Courtney also divorced. Both Liz and Jason moved on separately, Liz reuniting with and marrying Lucky (Greg Vaughan), and Jason falling in love with Sam McCall (Kelly Monaco), Sonny's pregnant ex-mistress. When Manny Ruiz (Robert LaSardo) terrorized Port Charles, he kidnapped Liz for spontaneous leverage. Lucky was badly injured while trying to save her, but Jason came to the rescue. Lucky's injuries, resulting financial issues, and wounded pride, led to an addiction to prescription painkillers and increasing jealousy of the men in Liz's life, including Jason, who had a knack for always being there for her when she needed someone. Manny shoots Sam and seriously injures her, and Jason leaves Sam, believing he is protecting her. Liz and Jason reconnect as friends as their lives crumble around them. Elizabeth's marriage to Lucky falls apart after Lucky's addiction leads to an affair with Maxie Jones (Kirsten Storms). Around that same time, Jason catches Sam sleeping with his enemy Ric. Liz shows up to Jason's. Jason and Liz have sex for the first time, both saddened over their heartbreaks. After Lucky checks into rehab, Jason and Liz decide to keep their one night stand together a secret to keep Lucky from relapsing. Elizabeth soon reveals that she is pregnant and Lucky promises to try harder at kicking his drug habit, which has directly led to two hard-falls for an expectant Liz. Jason and Elizabeth secretly order a paternity test. Jason asks Liz to marry him, regardless if whether he turns out to be the father or not. She turns him down, knowing they are both in love with other people, and not wanting to have him tied to her out of obligation instead of love. Jason reconciles with Sam, while Liz struggles with forgiving Lucky, and her own feelings for Jason, awakened the night they slept together. As more people find out about Liz's pregnancy, people, mainly Jason's best friend, Carly (Laura Wright), believe that Elizabeth tricked Jason into getting her pregnant. It is discovered, though, that they'd used a defective batch of ELQ Enduro condoms for protection. When Liz finally does get the paternity test back, Sonny is with her and, by Elizabeth's reaction, believes Lucky is the father, and tells everyone the good news. Elizabeth burns the results of the paternity test on the roof and the audience never sees the results. Jason and Elizabeth were both taken hostage during the Metro Court hostage crisis. When the police storm the building, Jason carries Liz to safety and they end up getting stuck in the elevator. Elizabeth tells Jason that he is her baby's father, who is shocked and hurt at the news. He asks Liz, who is now divorced, to marry him again, but she refuses for the second time, and Jason thinks better of it when he admits that he loves Sam. Liz and Jason decide to keep the baby's paternity secret, but in the coming months, they grow closer, with Liz admitting she loves Jason. When Elizabeth passes out after going into labor, Jason finds Elizabeth and takes her to the hospital. Jason watches from the window as Elizabeth gives birth to a baby boy she names Jacob Martin Spencer (Jacob Martin would give him Jason initials J. M.), where Sam sees him and secretly learns the truth. Sam, reeling from the lies and betrayal, doesn't step in when Elizabeth's back is turned, and a grieving mother kidnaps Jake from his stroller. Many people suspect that Elizabeth, who is suffering from Postpartum depression at the time, may have hurt Jake. But it is Jason who believes her innocence and soon finds Jake with a woman named Maureen Harper, who had recently lost her child in a fire. After Jason and Sam end their relationship which would be for 2 years, Sam goes after Lucky to get revenge on Elizabeth. Elizabeth and Jason admit they have feelings for one another, and Elizabeth moves into her own house, which Jason helps pay for. After Lucky and Liz's divorce, Sam threatens Elizabeth at the Black and White Ball to tell the truth. Liz learns that in addition to witnessing Jake's kidnapping, Sam hired two goons to scare Elizabeth and her kids at the park. Jason makes the decision to tell Lucky the truth and though he is furious, Jason, Liz, and Lucky decide to keep the secret to protect Jake from Jason's dangerous life. Shortly after, news of Emily's murder spreads across Port Charles. Jason and Liz find comfort in one another; the two soon began seeing one another in secret. Jason asks Liz to marry him and she happily accepted, but hours later, when Jason's nephew, Michael Corinthos (Dylan Cash) is shot, Jason decides to end their relationship. After Jake is kidnapped by Russian mobsters, Sam and Jason rescue him; Jason and Liz later realize they can never be a family. On March 18, 2011, Elizabeth is momentarily distracted when Jake wanders out the front door. He gets hit by a car, and Elizabeth gets him to the hospital. Despite the doctor's efforts, Jake is declared brain dead and left on life support. Soon, Jason is forced to tell Elizabeth that his goddaughter, Josslyn Jacks, is suffering from advanced kidney cancer and that Jake could save her. Elizabeth furiously slaps Jason, reminding him that he was not in Jake's life and has no right to make a decision about whether he lives or dies after he \\"abandoned\\" his own son. Eventually, Lucky talks Liz into donating Jake's kidney and saving Josslyn. Subsequently, Jason and Elizabeth share an emotional conversation, during which Elizabeth apologizes for earlier stating that Jason abandoned Jake and for never letting him get to know his son. However, Jason tells her that, while he never did know Jake, he did know that he was loved and cared for, and he will always be grateful to her for that. After Jake's death, Liz begins hallucinating and seeing Jake at work. She finds comfort with Jason, and learns that he and Sam have just gotten engaged. Jason married Sam, and the two were expecting their first child. However, when the baby died shortly after birth, Jason and Sam's marriage fell apart. Jason leaned on Elizabeth for support, and ended up kissing her impulsively. He backed off, and realized he still loved Sam. Eventually, Jason realized that the baby Sam buried wasn't hers, and asked for Elizabeth's help to prove that Sam's baby was alive. Elizabeth manipulated the results, though, hoping Jason would choose to be with her. However, Elizabeth later felt guilty, and admitted to Jason & Sam the truth. Jason found Sam's son, whom they named Daniel, and the two reunited. However, Jason was presumed dead shortly after, and Elizabeth was saddened. Jason (now Billy Miller) was revealed to be alive a few years later, being held captive by Helena Cassadine (Constance Towers). When he escaped, he was in a car accident, and admitted to the hospital as a John Doe. He woke up after going through multiple surgeries, including facial reconstruction, but had no memory of his past life. He bonded with Elizabeth while recovering. When Elizabeth talked about Jake, Jason felt like the name seemed familiar, and started going by Jake, believing that was his name. Elizabeth let \\"Jake\\" move into her place while he sorted out his life. The two connected, but when a woman named Hayden Barnes (Rebecca Budig) showed up and claimed \\"Jake\\" was her husband, Elizabeth backed off and dated Ric, her ex-husband. Lucky found out Elizabeth's son, Jake, was alive, and held captive on Cassadine Island by Helena. Jake was rescued and returned to Elizabeth. \\"Jake\\" met little Jake, and the two bonded. During the Nurses' Ball, Elizabeth got two major revelations: Ric had hired Hayden to pose as \\"Jake's\\" wife so Ric could date Elizabeth, and \\"Jake\\" was actually Jason. Afraid that Jason would get back with Sam if he knew the truth, Elizabeth kept his identity a secret. She broke up with Ric, and started a relationship with Jason. \\"Jake\\" still wanted answers, and asked for Sam's help to find out his identity. Elizabeth tried to dissuade him, wanting to hold onto Jason. \\"Jake\\" proposed to Elizabeth, and she accepted. On their wedding day, though, Jason found out the truth and stopped the wedding; Elizabeth pretended not to know. Jason still wasn't able to recover his memories, and stayed with Elizabeth. He asked Sam for a divorce to marry Elizabeth. Sam figured out Elizabeth's secret, though, and decided to confront her. Jason didn't believe Sam, and defended Elizabeth. However, he later went to apologize to Sam, who told Jason her suspicions. Jason left and confronted Elizabeth, who was forced to admit the truth. Heartbroken and angry, Jason broke up with Elizabeth, and moved out. Though he promised to still be part of Jake's life, Jason was done with Elizabeth. After Jason left, strange occurrences started happening to Elizabeth and Jake. Their house was vandalized, and Jake thought he was being followed. Jason tried to help out Jake, promising to keep him safe. However, he & Elizabeth later figured out that Jake was staging the situations, in hopes that his parents would reconcile. Sam realized what Jake was doing, and tried to help Jake, but she got injured and knocked unconscious. Scared by what had happened to Sam, Jake ran away and was hit by a car. He was rushed to the hospital where Jake survived, and Jason and Elizabeth let him be admitted to a children's hospital for treatment. Sam was rescued by Jason, and also recovered. When Sam showed up with Danny to visit Jake at the hospital, Elizabeth realized that Jason & Sam had reconnected, and Jason had moved on. Jason and Elizabeth talked about their relationship and past while Jake was recovering, and they eventually made peace, agreeing to co-parent Jake and be friends. Reception and impact Despite never having been paired together on-screen for an extended length of time, Jason and Elizabeth have had very vocal fans. Burton told Soap Opera Digest during the couple's 2008 break up: \\"We had quite the following for a couple who never were together. I don't write the show. If it was up to me, I would have played it out to see where it went.\\" Herbst reflected in 2010: \\"I would have said Jason and Elizabeth would never be together quite a few years ago, and Steve said the same thing. We kept telling the Liason girls, 'Stop writing, because nothing is going to happen. It's been 7 years... get over it.' Steve would joke and sure enough it happened, so I will never say never.\\" Zap2it named them No. 2 on their list of Top Couples of 2007, while putting Elizabeth and Sam McCall (Kelly Monaco), Jason's other love interest, as No. 1 of their Top 10 Rivalries of 2007, stating, \\"without question Liz vs. Sam is the biggest rivalry in daytime.\\"Zap2it tied them for No. 3 in 2008 along with entangled couple Sam and Lucky Spencer (then Greg Vaughan), stating: \\"Liason fans have been waiting for their couple to be together for years, but even when these two, or the writers or executives in charge of the storyline, can't seem to get their act together, their fans still hold on tight.\\" In 2008, Jason and Elizabeth were included by Soaps In Depth of the Top 100 Greatest Couples of ABC Daytime.

He was a prominent advocate of freedom of the press and the abolition of compulsory labor. Biography =Origins and education= His father was a physician raised to the nobility by Emperor Joseph II, and a professor of medicine at the University of Freiburg. His mother came from a noble line from Lothringen (Poirot d'Ogeron). Karl was reared as a Catholic, and was a talented and industrious scholar. At 15, he began attending the University of Freiburg, where he studied jurisprudence. During the preparatory philosophical courses, Rotteck got to know the first Protestant professor of the university, Johann Georg Jacobi, whose teaching and society were major influences on him. Like many of his contemporaries, Rotteck was sympathetic with the strivings of the French for freedom in the French Revolution, but his sympathy with the Revolution was quickly extinguished by its raw realities. The invasion of his homeland by the French and the changes in land ownership which followed their victories outraged his sense of justice and his national sensitivities. =Early career= In 1797, at 22, he passed with excellence the Baden juridical exam and began his judicial career as a magistrate of the city of Freiburg. Even as a student, he had had little joy in jurisprudence, and the prosaic duties of his office completely spoiled the field for him. Having from early childhood an interest in historical studies, especially biography, he applied in 1798 for the vacated office of professor of history at the University of Freiburg and received it. In those times, the frankness with which he expressed himself and his spirited idealism compensated for his lack of objective historical knowledge, without which later no beginner would think of trying for a teaching position, to say nothing of being allowed to fill it for 20 years. He held the position until 1818. He lacked some physical requirements for teaching: he spoke monotonously, and with a weak voice. But his genuine spiritedness and outrage bound his listeners to him, and left behind ideal conceptions of how things should be arranged. =Allgemeine Geschichte= Karl von Rotteck's Allgemeine Geschichte, title page of the 1848 edition After some time, Rotteck was no longer contented with the relatively small public provided by his lecture hall, and in 1812 he began to publish his Allgemeine Geschichte, which passed through many editions in Germany and was available in translation the world over. This work made what he presented in the lecture hall the common possession of hundreds of thousands. In the preface he himself characterizes his work as not so much a scholarly endeavor as a persuasive and agitating one. He made no claim, he said, to widen or deepen historical knowledge. He only aimed to take the historical knowledge at hand and through an appropriate treatment make it accessible to the layperson and not only to enrich the reader of average education but also strengthen the moral will, and especially influence the character and attitude of young people coming of age. This goal the author reached in full measure. Rotteck appealed to the flawless vigor of the life of the people, to the love of freedom and fatherland; he alluded to equalizing justice in the development of nations. This little affected the relationship of the author to his closest contemporaries, but for hundreds of thousands into whose hands the book came, those who smarted under the yoke of Napoleon, it was taken as a balm in times of suffering, a call to persevere, a promise of better times. The later volumes in the series, published after Napoleon's defeat, found a different situation in the world. In contrast to the oppressive attitude of the German governments which so sorely disappointed the fighters in the war of liberation, the pathos of Rotteck's presentation of history, its exaltation of the free development of the spirit of the people, the fight for justice and self-determination over willfulness and tyranny, found a genuinely thankful and enthusiastic public. Through the publication of a four-volume extract from his Allgemeine Geschichte, Rotteck made its contents accessible to the widest possible audience. =Political scientist= At the university, where the revitalization of the critical method of historical research posed more earnest requirements to the practitioner than those which Rotteck could fulfill, in 1818 Rotteck exchanged his history pulpit for one in political science and natural law. In this field as well, his inclination to practical achievement felt the need to spread his teaching beyond the walls of his lecture hall, and from 1829 to 1836, he published in four volumes his Primer of political science and rational law () which in his mind promised to outdo the almost unprecedented success of his world history in its effect on contemporary public opinion. However these expectations were disappointed. Jean-Jacques Rousseau's ideas of a collective will on which Rotteck's theories relied had long been superseded, and the generation now coming to maturity was much too concerned with practical tasks that society needed to solve through its politics to let itself be caught up in Rotteck's abstract idealism. =Journalism= Nevertheless Rotteck's judgement on the questions of the day still had great influence, especially after he founded his organ, the Allgemeine politischen Annalen, where he commented on all worldly affairs from his pulpit of the liberal point of view. His theories, sometimes growing wildly from the foundations of rational law, expressly justified revolution as long as it didn't formally conflict with rational law. These ideas seemed to the authorities of the German Confederation to begin to become dangerous as he started to mint them in the small change of political agitation in articles in The Independent () which was targeted at the public at large. He had founded this journal in 1832 in Freiburg in cooperation with Carl Welcker. At the instance of the Bundestag, the publication of Die Freisinnige was suspended and the Annals were forbidden and Rotteck was prohibited from issuing a similar journal for the next five years. At the same time, he was dismissed from his teaching position. These actions were in accordance with the Carlsbad Decrees. These experiences did not hinder Rotteck from entering a new large literary undertaking in 1834, once again in cooperation with his friend Welcker: the Political dictionary (), a political encyclopedia for the spreading of liberal ideas. For a generation, the German middle class, which gravitated toward these ideas, looked for and found explanations on all questions of political life in this work, until the dissimilar, though more solid, Staatsw√∂rterbuch of Johann Caspar Bluntschli and Karl Brater superseded it. =Politician= Although his writings found a following in Europe and the world, Rotteck's practical political accomplishments were primarily devoted to the Grand Duchy of Baden, into which, in consequence of the Peace of Pressburg, his home of Breisgau had been incorporated. In 1818 when the constitution granted by the Grand Duchy gave the University of Freiburg the right to send a representative to the first chamber of the diet (), Rotteck's professorial colleagues turned this duty over to Rotteck. He immediately introduced important motions: One sought to set aside the regulation which made admission to studies dependent on certain preconditions. Another was directed against the perceived meddling of the Roman Curie in church life and requested an independent national Catholic church. Not less decisively did he speak out for the legal sanctioning of freedom of the press. In the diets of 1819/20 and 1822/23 he was especially active for the abolishment of compulsory labor obligations () and tasks stemming from personal serfdom (). In the treatment of these questions, he stood completely on the foundation of natural law and would hear of no compromises. An 1819 act of the second chamber abolished compulsory labor required by the state with the extra costs which resulted being absorbed by the treasury. In contrast to this arrangement, the act suggested purchasing the freedom of personal serfs. Rotteck spoke against this differing treatment. He also spoke out for abolishment of personal serfdom, which was against the spirit of the times, no less than for the abolishment of the duties associated with it. In his point of view, Rotteck stood alone in the first chamber, and for this reason he earnestly wished to get a place in the second chamber. This wish was not quickly granted, though it is true that his colleagues decided to no longer send him to the first chamber, and in his stead sent a conservative professor of medicine. Contrary to Rotteck's desires, the government, which during the elections for 1825 and 1828 successfully exercised all its options to derail the opposition, impeded his entrance into the second chamber. His entrance into the second chamber only occurred after the succession of Grand Duke Leopold, with whom more liberal principles broke in. From 1831 until his death, Rotteck belonged to the second chamber of the Baden diet, and during these nine years he tirelessly worked for the promotion of political and economic matters which were close to his heart. He opposed Jewish emancipation in Baden. He worked for freedom of the press. A law for protecting freedom of the press was passed in the diet of 1831, and Rotteck saw it as a result of his efforts even though it didn't fully satisfy him. At the diet of 1833, he poured out his full measure of scorn when a decree of the German Confederation dictated an early end for the youthful Baden press freedom. When the Baden ministry, which had obeyed a mighty pressure from Prussia and Austria when it had revoked the liberal press law, saw a vote of no confidence in a resolution put forward by Rotteck for the preservation of the law and rejected it as slanderous, Rotteck made a resolution for the naming of a commission which would assess the condition of the fatherland and afterward lay appropriate legislation before the second chamber. When this resolution was rejected by the chamber, he renewed it in the diet of 1835 with a motion that the government might by constitutional means achieve and give top precedence to the fulfillment and guarantee of the constitution with a law on minister responsibility, a press law and through measures for the protection of the integrity of domestic politics against inroads of the Bundestag. And when finally his stubbornness could no longer deny that there was no possibility of achieving the full freedom of the press he sought, he put before the diet of 1839 a motion which sought at least to introduce \\"some justice in press affairs and to mitigate the reigning press slavery.\\" His goal of the removal of burdensome compulsory labor, which he had started toward in the first chamber, Rotteck pursued in the second chamber with the same zeal, and his efforts were crowned with more success. When the diet of 1831 brought freedom from obligatory labor () to reality with a law, Rotteck just as soon raised his voice for the abolition of tithing (). The diet of 1833 responded to that objective with a suggested model for lawmaking which would abolish the land-clearing tithes ( or Novalzehnt) without compensation and lift the tithe on slaughtered animals ( or Fleischzehnt) for a compensation of a fifteen-folding of one year's total, which would come half from the government treasury and half from the community from which the tithe was due. The resistance of the first chamber to these changes aroused Rotteck's greatest resentment. But when finally through compromises by both chambers a law, which had threatened to fail due to the resistance, came to a vote, Rotteck voted against the law since it didn't represent a full victory of the law of reason over the unseemliness of the historical law. In spite of this, the people, thankful for the mitigation that had been achieved, saw Rotteck as the one to whom full credit was due for it. At this time, he stood at the height of his popularity. A witness to this popularity was the proposal that each community should find an attractive place of their tithe-free lands and plant a group of oaks and call them \\"Rotteck oaks.\\" This proposal didn't come to pass, but showed the common feeling of the people. Freiburg bust Somewhat earlier, at the beginning of 1833, to a certain extent as an answer to the dismissal of Rotteck from his teaching position, his home town of Freiburg elected him as mayor. The Baden government denied its sanction to this result and Rotteck himself advised against a second vote which threatened to create a malignant quarrel between Baden and the city of Freiburg. When it came to his person, he could give in; but when it came to, by his way of seeing things, a point of principle being in play, he remained inexorable in the position he took. Thus in the diet of 1837 he resisted with much determination the government's suggestion of division of the electorate into classes after a census, since this contradicted what he saw as a just principle of the absolute equality of all citizens. On the grounds of principle, he also opposed a treaty for incorporating Baden into the German customs union () since he saw in the closer relationship to Prussia which would thereby result the danger of a plan to undermine the constitutional life of the state. And his pamphlet on behalf of the archbishop of Cologne (Clemens August von Droste-Vischering) who had been arrested by the Prussian government, stemmed not from any sanction for clerical endeavors, but only from an abstract legal viewpoint which determined him \\"to protest against mixing decrees of the government in church affairs.\\" After Rotteck's death in 1840, the government prohibited any public gathering by which his admirers could organize the erection a memorial. Even the simple bronze bust which his friends erected on the plaza in front of the University of Freiburg in 1848 was removed in 1850 by order of the police. Only after the entry of the \\"new era\\" in 1863 were they able to erect it again, this time before his residence.

History Founded in 1972, by Dr. Robert S. Breakstone, ADVI was the first organization to establish a framework in which American dental professionals could volunteer their services in Israel. Its mission was to provide free high-level professional dental care for Israelis primarily on Kibbutzim. ADVI was set up after Dr. Breakstone first volunteered on Kibbutz Sha'ar HaAmakim in 1970. Upon returning to the USA he established ADVI, and was able to secure the cooperation of the emissary of the Kibbutz Aliyah Desk in New York City in placing hundreds of dentists who were prepared to offer their services for a minimum of two weeks each year in return for modest accommodations on a Kibbutz. Eight years later in 1980, a parallel organization, Dental Volunteers for Israel (DVI)DVI Founding - Trudi Birger was created to provide free dental services to poor children in Israeli urban settings. With Holocaust Survivor Trudi Birger at the helm, DVI founders established the free Jerusalem clinic, the sole remaining clinic in Israel where foreign dentists may legally volunteer. ADVI slowly phased out in the late 1990s, in good part because of a feeling from the Ministry of Health that Israel was by then producing enough dentists to fill the country's needs. ADVI donated a large share of its remaining funds to DVI and a plaque was hung in the Trudi Birger Clinic to honor ADVI leaders: Dr Robert Breakstone (Founder and President from 1973-1983), Paul Jarmon (President from 1984-1993), and Robert E. Lewis (President from 1993-1997). Membership At its height ADVI was sending between 200 and 300 dentists a year to Israel, with an estimated 1500 dental volunteers throughout its existence.

Main Street, Fredericksburg, Gillespie County, in the U.S. state of Texas. Designed by Alfred Giles, it was built in 1882 to replace the original 1855 courthouse, and was later superseded by the current 1939 courthouse designed by Edward Stein. The first floor houses the Pioneer Memorial Library, while the second floor functions as community hall. It is often called the McDermott Building because of the 1967 and 1984 restorations funded by Mr. & Mrs. Eugene McDermott. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1971, and was designated a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark in 1967. Construction The native limestone structure was designed in 1882 by architect Alfred Giles in the Romanesque Revival style. Giles also designed the Brooks County Courthouse, Live Oak County Courthouse, Presidio County Courthouse, Webb County Courthouse and Wilson County Courthouse, as well as courthouses in the counties of Goliad and Kerr. In 1909, Giles designed the facade of the Kendall County Courthouse. He also designed the 1885 Llano County courthouse, which burned down in 1892. On November 28, 1881. Giles was commissioned for $1,000 by the Gillespie County Commissioners. Built of local limestone, the Dietz Quarries supplied the limestone for the main structure, while John Dechert Quarries of Luckenbach supplied the limestone for the trim. Building contractors John Heinen & James A. Courtney erected the structure at a cost of $23,000. Restoration When a new courthouse was built in 1939, the old building served a variety of uses, until its state of disrepair forced it to be condemned in 1963. The building was restored in 1967 as a home for the library, a gift from Texas Instruments founder and Dallas philanthropists Mr. & Mrs. Eugene McDermott. Eugene McDermott died in 1973. A second renovation of the library occurred in 1984 with matching funds from Mrs. McDermott and the community.

He became a partner in 1921, and remained with that and succeeding firms for thirty years. Middleton had a two-year term as president of the Toledo Chamber of Commerce beginning in 1938. He formed the firm Middleton, Morgan & Leatherman in 1949. On September 13, 1950, Edward C. Turner of the Ohio Supreme Court died. Governor Frank Lausche appointed Howard E. Faught to fill the vacancy. The vacancy occurred more than forty days before the next general election, so Faught had to run for election to complete the term. Too little time remained for a primary nomination or for ballots to be printed, so Faught and his opponents had to run as write-in candidates. Middleton received more votes than the combined total of his seven opponents. Middleton served the remaining four years of Turner's term, but was defeated for re-election by Democrat James F. Bell in 1954. He returned to Toledo and private practice, and represented the Toledo, St. Louis and Western Railroad. Middleton married Myrtle E. Johnson in 1907 and had one son, James A. Middleton.

Key, V., U. S. Army Reserve, The Owens Valley Indian War, 1861-1865, Submitted to the Faculty of U.S. Army Command and General Staff College, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. 1979 The removal of a large number of the Owens River Native Californians to Fort Tejon in 1863, was considered the end of the war. Minor hostilities continued occasionally until 1867.  Origins of the conflict  During the winter of 1861-1862, in the Owens Valley, the storms that produced the Great Flood of 1862 resulted in snow and flooding conditions in the surrounding mountains and as far to the east as the Mono County seat at Aurora. There had been light snowfall in November, then mild weather until Christmas Eve when it began a heavy and rapid snowfall for days, the temperature dropped below zero and the passes over the Sierra were closed. During the second week of January it warmed slightly and the snow became a torrential rain. Creeks overflowed their banks, flooding low-lying areas. After a week it cooled again and snow began to fall. Within a few days the snow was deeper than it had been before the rains had begun to fall. Samuel Young of Aurora, recorded in his diary that the snow and rain had fallen for twenty six days out of thirty since December 24, 1861.Roger D. McGrath, Gunfighters, Highwaymen, and Vigilantes: Violence on the Frontier, University of California Press, 1987. p.20 This cold weather and flooding resulted in the local Paiute suffering the loss of much of the game they depended on. Additionally, the cattle driven into the Owens Valley in 1861 to feed the Aurora miners, competed with the native grazers. They also ate the native wild plant crops the Paiute irrigated and depended on as a staple to survive. Starving, the Paiute began to kill the cattle and conflict with the cattlemen began, leading to the subsequent Owens Valley Indian War.

They then sent messages for help to Aurora, county seat of nearby Mono County, and Visalia, county seat of their own Tulare County, over the Sierra Nevada mountains, for help. * Colonel James H. Carleton, the Commander of the District of Southern California, received correspondence from Mr. S. A. Bishop of Fort Tejon and Mr. W. A. Greenly of the Owens Valley explaining the situation in the Owens Valley and requesting military assistance. Col. Carlton had Colonel George W. Bowie, Commanding Officer of Camp Latham, issue Special Orders Number 7. - March 17, 1862.  Lieutenant Colonel George S. Evans and a detachment of companies G, I and K, Second Cavalry, California Volunteers, was ordered to proceed from Camp Latham to Owens Valley via Fort Tejon. Evans was to investigate the situation in Owens Valley and report back. His command was to take forty days rations and one hundred rounds of ammunition per man. * When Acting Indian Agent for Nevada, Colonel Warren Wasson, had been informed of events to the south, he wired James W. Nye, Governor of Nevada Territory, then in San Francisco, about a peace mission to the Owens River Valley to prevent an Indian War from involving Nevada. Governor Nye approved the idea and asked General George Wright, Commander of the Department of the Pacific, for a fifty-man escort for the mission. General Wright ordered Captain E. A. Rowe, Commander of Fort Churchill, Nevada, to provide the necessary men. Captain Rowe ordered Post Lieutenant Herman Noble, 2nd Cavalry, Detachment Commander in Aurora, Nevada, to proceed to the Owens Valley with Colonel Wasson on a peacekeeping mission. Lieutenant Noble and his detachment linked up with Colonel Wasson about south of Aurora on April 4, 1862, and proceeded southward towards the Owens Valley. * Raid on Alabama Hills Camp by settler posse under Charles Anderson - March 20, 1862 * Volunteers arrive. 18 men from Aurora under John J. Kellogg, former Army captain and 22 from Visalia under Colonel William Mayfield, a retired Army officer.

As Evans' and Mayfield's force marched north, Evans' scouts reported that Lieutenant Noble with fifty men of Company A, 2nd Cavalry, from Fort Churchill on their way south to Putnam's Store were nearby. Colonel Evans halted until Lieutenant Noble's command could come up with them and then proceeded to the north. - April 7, 1862. * Scouts were sent out and one scout returned reporting a large force of Indians away near Bishop Creek. Evans moved up in a snow storm, but the Indians had left at the approach of the main body of cavalry. Campfires were observed in a canyon to the north. - April 8, 1862 * Battle of Mayfield Canyon - April 9, 1862 * Following the battle in Mayfield Canyon, Colonel Evans, out of provisions after feeding both his men and citizens in the Owens Valley, decided to return to Camp Latham, via Putnam's Store. Lieutenant Noble and his detachment accompanied Colonel Evans as far as Putnam's. The settlers demanded protection from the Indians from Colonel Evans. Colonel Evans explained that he did not have the authority to leave troops to protect the citizens and had no provisions for them to live upon if they did. Settlers had three options: remain in the valley, accompany Colonel Evans to Los Angeles or drive their livestock (4,000 cattle and 2,500 sheep) out of Owens Valley. Most of the settlers chose the latter. - April 10, 1862. * Colonel Evans started back some to Los Angeles, and Lieutenant Noble returned to Aurora. - April 14, 1862 * The Owens Valley Indians found they were left unopposed in the valley and attacked isolated parties of stockmen and miners throughout the area. - May and June 1862 =Evans' second campaign= * Lt. Colonel Evans' detachment returned to Camp Latham. - April 28.  Evans' report recommended a military post be established in the Owens Valley to protect the citizens and the route to the mining areas from Visalia and Los Angeles. * Several citizens escorted out of Owens Valley by Colonel Evans traveled to San Francisco and urged General Wright that a permanent military post be established in the valley. After reading Colonel Evans' report of the situation in Owens Valley, General Wright wrote to Colonel Ferris Foreman, new commander of Camp Latham, to send two or three companies of the Second Cavalry with Lt. Colonel Evans as commander to establish a post in the Owens Valley. - May 2, 1862 * Captain E. A. Rowe, with a detachment of Company A, 2nd Cavalry, came to Adobe Meadows, establishing a camp for the purpose of having talks with Mono leader Mannawahe. - June and July 1862. * Colonel Evans with 201 men of Companies D, G and I, 2nd Cavalry, California Volunteers, departed Camp Latham for the Owens Valley. With them was a train of 46 wagons carrying equipment, ammunition and rations for the men.- June 14, 1862. * Evans reaches Owens Valley. - June 30, 1862. * After five days of chasing Indians in the valley, Colonel Evans decided that they would not come out to fight in the open and that it was impossible to follow them in the mountains and that a permanent military camp was required. Camp Independence, a base of operations in Owens Valley, was established on Oak Creek and named for the occasion, Independence Day. - July 4, 1862. * Captain Rowe moved his command to a new camp east of the Owens River, opposite Camp Independence. - July 5, 1862. =First attempt at peace= * Captain Rowe, Company A, 2nd Cavalry, California Volunteers, despatched a note to Colonel Evans at Camp Independence stating that he and Mr. Wasson, the Indian Agent, had talked to Indian leaders in the area and made a treaty with them. A temporary peace was made for the summer with the Owens Valley Indian leaders, in anticipation of a permanent arrangement to follow. - On July 7, 1862.  A meeting was arranged between Colonel Evans, Captain Rowe, Colonel Wasson and Captain George, a war chief of the Paiutes. Captain George stated that he didn't want to fight anymore and wanted to become a friend of the white man.  Colonel Evans felt that many of the promises made by Indian Agent Wasson could not be kept. He also reported that if the troops were withdrawn, the attacks would resume. * Department of the Pacific concurred with the terms of the treaty with the addition of provisions that the Indians were to restore all property stolen from the whites and they were to surrender four or five hostages to be a guarantee or their good faith. * J. H. P. Wentworth, Indian Agent for the Southern California District, met with Colonel Wasson and as a result sent messages out to the Indians to gather at Camp Independence. The meeting was held and a treaty was signed. - October 6, 1862  Captain George, Tinemba, and several others surrendered themselves and their families as hostages.  Joaquin Jim, not a participant in the treaty, continued hostilities. * Colonel Evans left Camp Independence to establish Camp Babbitt outside Visalia with Company D and I, 2nd Cavalry. 100 men of Company G, 2nd Cavalry, under Captain Theodore H. Goodman was left behind to garrison and continue building Camp Independence. * Captain Goodman resigned his commission, being replaced by Captain Ropes in command of Camp Independence. - January 31, 1863 =Owens Valley Indians return to war= * Captain George disappeared from Camp Independence after receiving his rations. - March 1, 1863  Captain Ropes sent soldiers to various settlements, warning people to stay home and be on their guard. * Four miners were attacked at Big Pine Creek, leaving 1 wounded and 1 killed. - March 2, 1863.McGrath, Gunfighters, ..., p. 33 * Captain Jack's band sacked the cabin of a mining company, taking guns and ammunition and destroying everything else not taken. Several other cabins were also sacked and another miner killed in the next few days. At Ida Camp sections of a water pipe was taken for its lead. Later two miners fetching water from the spring for Ida were attacked, killing one, the other saving himself by a ruse.McGrath, Gunfighters, ..., pp. 33-34 * Captain Ropes sent messages to Camp Babbit requesting assistance. Camp Babbitt immediately sent First Lieutenant S. R. Davis with 44 men to reinforce camp Independence. * Skirmish at Black Rocks - March 11, 1863 * Battle of Alabama Hills - March 19, 1863 * Company E, 2nd Cavalry arrived, as reinforcements under the command of Captain Herman Noble. - April 4, 1863 * Battle of Big Pine Creek - April 9, 1863 * Lt. Col. William Jones, Commander at Camp Babbitt, ordered Captain Moses A. McLaughlin to reinforce Camp Independence with a detachment of 24 men of Company D and 18 men of Company E, 2nd Cavalry, California Volunteers, with one 12-pounder howitzer, and four six-mule government teams, carrying rations, company property, ammunition, and forage. Because settlers of Keyesville had appealed to the Department of the Pacific, orders included the instructions: * McLaughlin's detachment carries out the Keyesville Massacre - April 19, 1863 =McLaughlin's Owens Valley Campaign= * Captain McLaughlin arrived at Camp Independence. As senior captain he became the new Camp Commander. - April 24, 1863 *McLaughlin's Operations in Owens Valley - April 25 - May 14, 1863  McLaughlin changed tactics previously used in the war. No longer pursuing the enemy up canyons in the mountains to be ambushed in places of their choosing, McLaughlin sent detachments of his men up the mountains at night. Then at daylight they would sweep downward toward the valley, driving any enemy out into the valley where another detachment awaited to cut them off.War of the Rebellion, Series I, Volume L, Part I, p. 210  Under Captain McLaughlin the soldiers were constantly seeking out the Indian food stores and destroying them.  Scouting parties were employed in searching for any smaller bands who might have remained behind hidden in the tule swamps along the river, and scarcely a day passed without two or three of them being found and killed, and everything destroyed that could be of any use to the living. McLaughlin instructed the troops that it was of the utmost importance that prisoners should be taken, not only women but men, confident that their love of life would prompt them to furnish important information and that possibly they could be used as guides.  The Owens Valley Indians had never been taught how to maintain their firearms, and their firearms became rusted and encrusted with dirt, making many unserviceable. Some gun barrels exploded. * Several Indians who had remained hidden near the Owens River were captured by Captain Noble's men, and finding that they would not be harmed, but that they would receive food and clothing, and being informed through the interpreter that Captain McLaughlin came to make peace, not war, they were prevailed upon to conduct the troops to where they supposed a large party belonging to Joaquin Jim was encamped and where they could be surrounded. From these Indians McLaughlin learned that Captain George was near Death Valley and furnished them with passes and white flags, allowing them fifteen days from the 16th of May to find Captain George and the other Indians and bring them into camp. - May 14, 1863 * Raid on Joaquin Jim's Camp - May 15‚Äì19, 1863 * At Captain Noble's camp on Big Pine Creek, McLaughlin issued an order suspending hostilities until further orders and sent out more Indian messengers. - May 19, 1863War of the Rebellion, Series I, Volume L, Part I, pp. 210-212 = Captain George and others surrender, Paiute removed to Fort Tejon, Camp Independence abandoned = * Captain George came to Camp Independence to talk peace. He indicated that he no longer wanted war. As a result of his surrender, more than four hundred Indians came in to lay down their arms. - May 22, 1863  The bands of Captain Dick and Tinemaha soon followed Captain George's example. By June there were 500 Paiute at the camp and almost 1000 by July. * Thomas M. Heston, of Visalia, was killed by Paiute, between Adobe Meadows and Aurora. - mid-June * Captain Brown with 90 soldiers and 26 Paiute including Captain George trailed Joaquin Jim through Round Valley, up Pine Creek and over Italy Pass into the Sierras, losing him a week later. - Late June 1863 * By the time the surrendered Indians left under escort to Fort Tejon and the San Sebastian Indian Reservation they numbered over nine hundred. - July 11, 1863 * Surrendered Owens Valley Paiute arrived at the Reservation, less 50 who had slipped away during the trip. - July 22, 1863 * Captain McLaughlin abandoned Camp Independence, under orders to reopen and garrison Fort Tejon. - July 31, 1863. * Joaquin Jim in Long Valley and other remaining fugitive bands continued hostilities in the valley, no longer threatened by the soldiers at Camp Independence.McGrath, Gunfighters, ..., p.42 = Apparent peace, mining rush, new settlements and minor incidents = * Following the removal of the Paiute to the reservation, miners and other settlers believed that the Indian war was over, and began coming to the existing settlements, and new mining settlements sprang up:  Lone Pine, near the mouth of Owens River, Bend City, San Carlos, further up the river Chrysopolis, Galena, Graham City (or Riverside) and Owensville.  There were rushes to strikes in the White Mountains, Slate Mountain, the Keyes District, Head of the Lake, and the Sierra foothills.  Thousands of cattle were driven over the mountains into Owens Valley or through it into Nevada to escape the killing 1863-64 drought that beset the rest of California. * However, it was still dangerous for single travelers or small groups in the valley or surrounding mountains.  Stephen Orjada was ambushed by Indians as he rode from Keyesville to Walker Basin. - August 1863McGrath, Gunfighters, p.42, Note 93.

With Merriam as guide, they left San Carlos to aid the three other men of the Church party to recover their bodies and punish their attackers. - September 3, 1863  The bodies of two men were recovered, one was never found, presumed captured. Paiute were gone, leaving large supplies of pine nuts which Phillips' company destroyed.  Returning to San Carlos the party encountered two men intending to build a sawmill at Big Pine. Indians had warned them to leave, and after talking with the Phillips company they decided to do so.Chalfant, The story of Inyo, pp. 157-159 * During the remaining months of 1863, there were no further incidents with the Paiutes in Owens Valley. * Captain McLaughlin made a tour of inspection of Owens Valley as far as Bishop Creek. - November 23 - December 16, 1863  McLaughlin reported: > The valley is fast filling up with settlers and miners, and no fear is > entertained of Indians as far up as Bishop Creek, which is the highest > settlement in the valley.

Citizens of Owensville organized volunteers, with lawyer/gunfighter Will Hicks Graham as captain.  At Bend City W. L. Moore and W. A. Greenly were selected to lead the volunteer forces. * Meanwhile, Lieut. Robert Daley, having returned from the Owens Valley, reported on conditions there: - December 3, 1864 > Sir: In accordance with orders from headquarters Department of the Pacific, > I have the honor to make the following report relative to the Indians in > Owen's River Valley: I found Indian supplies in the valley not good, and the > most of the Indians had left for the mountains.

Museo del Prado, Madrid. Oil on wood panel, 52 cm x 41 cm. Self-portrait (or Self-portrait at 26) is the second of Albrecht D√ºrer's three painted self-portraits, and was executed in oil on wood panel in 1498, after his first trip to Italy. In the depiction, D√ºrer elevates himself to the social position he believed suited to an artist of his ability. He presents himself in half length, under an arch, turned towards the viewer. He bears an arrogant expression, betraying the assured self-confidence of a young artist at the height of his ability. His presence dominates the pictorial space, from his hat which almost reaches the top of the canvas to his arm positioned on the lower ledge, where he rests his fingers enclosed in fine rich gloves.Bailey, 60 Until some time in the 19th century the painting was hung with and kept as a companion piece with Portrait of D√ºrer's Father at 70; in 1636 the two paintings were gifted as a pair to Charles I of England by the city of Nuremberg,Wieseman, Marjorie E. \\"'The Painter's Father', 1497\\".

Today it is in the Museo del Prado in Madrid.Self-portrait, Museo del Prado Description D√ºrer is depicted in front of an open window before a flat landscape containing a lake and distant snow-capped mountains. The landscape may represent either the memory of his recent travels abroad or his inner mental state.Brion, 132 Light spills from the window, falling along his head to highlight both his delicate skin tones and long blond hair. D√ºrer is dressed with effeminate grace in flamboyant, extravagant clothes showing the influence of Italian fashion. His low-necked shirt or chemise is of fine linen, gathered and trimmed with a band of gold braid or embroidery, and worn under an open-fronted doublet and a cloak tied over one shoulder. His white jacket has black lining under a white pleated shirt of which the verticals match the horizontals of his headdress. His fingers are crossed, hidden inside silk gloves, an unusual pose for D√ºrer's early career; he always paid close attention in detailing the hands of his sitters who are usually showing holding an object; examples include a pillow, rosary, sheet of paper and flower.Waetzoldt, Wilhelm. \\"D√ºrer and his times\\". London: Phaidon Press, 1950. 111 D√ºrer is presented as almost seductive, with a rakish patterned hat placed over long, almost girlishly curled blond locks of hairIn his last full self-portrait in 1500, D√ºrer hides his blond hair under a dark wig, but one which is also curled. under a draped pointed hat with a tassel. He looks out at the viewer with a cool ironic stare. Interpretation Art historian Marcel Brion believes the self- portrait marks a farewell to his irresponsible youth, the acclaim he received during his visit to Italy and his general apprehension as the 15th century came to an end and dark clouds hung over the Germanic states. The middleground of the pleasing flat plain and lake may represent his travels from 1492 to 1497, yet they are shadowed by steep mountainous glaciers; forebodings of what lay in store. In this Brion interprets the artist's state as looking toward his future and past. D√ºrer's youthful character was enthusiastic, adventurous and inhibited, and after he left his hometown of Nuremberg in 1490 to travel as journeyman painter he was able to live his early youth with abandon and almost without consequence. By the time this portrait was painted he was back home, and old enough to begin to accept responsibilities. D√ºrer had already established himself as a significant artist, and was perhaps fearful of losing this status. In the following decade, before he left Italy to return home in October 1506 he would write to his friend Willibald Pirckheimer, \\"How I shall freeze after this sun! Here I am a gentleman, at home only a parasite.\\"Sturge Moore, 60 From these words it might be concluded that his extravagant self- representation may be seen as a front, described by Brion as \\"the outer skin of a chrysalis, discarded by the future personality fore-shadowed in that gaze when the coming tempest of conflicting emotions burst upon him.\\"Brion, 133-34 In the end his fears were misplaced; soon after his return to Nuremberg he was widely hailed and given a social status equivalent to an \\"Ehrbaren\\" (wealthy merchant). The following year he published of his edition of the \\"Apocalypse\\", and his personal and self-absorbed fear being supplanted by more metaphysical worries.Brion, 134 Gallery File:Durer-self-portrait-at-the-age-of- thirteen.jpgSelf-portrait at 13, 1484.

Purman (April 19, 1886 ‚Äì April 18, 1937) was an American sportswriter. Purman had a lengthy career in journalism, but he is best known for his work in the years from 1916 to 1918 when his sports column was syndicated in hundreds of newspapers and he selected an annual All-America football team for the Newspaper Enterprise Association. Early years Purman was born in 1886 at Monroeville, Indiana. His father James Nelson Purman was a merchant in Montpelier, Indiana, operating Purman, Johnston & Co.' Big Store. Purman attended preparatory school in Annapolis, Maryland, and was appointed to the United States Naval Academy. However, he failed the physical examination \\"on account of an affliction of his eyes.\\" Purman enrolled instead at Indiana University Bloomington. In 1907, he worked for the Indiana Pipe Line Company and the Ohio Oil Company. Journalist Purman began his career in journalism with The Evening Herald in his hometown of Montpelier, Indiana. In August 1907, he accepted a full-time position as a reporter for the Bluffton Banner in Bluffton, Indiana. In November 1907, he moved to Danville, Illinois as a reporter for a newspaper there. He later returned to Montplier as the editor of The Evening Herald. He next joined the staff of the Marion Chronicle in approximately 1910. From 1916 to 1918, Purman became a nationally syndicated sportswriter. He was affiliated with the Newspaper Enterprise Association, a syndicate of several hundred newspapers, and selected an annual college football All-America team for the NEA. In the 1920s, he returned to Cleveland and became the news editor for Midweek Magazine.

Her teaching style and publications were considered ahead of their time. She used a method that encouraged students to develop their own research skills utilizing primary sources and their own problem solving skills. Sheldon was teacher of and major influence on author and socialist Anna Strunsky. Biography =Youth and education= Mary Downing Sheldon was born in Oswego, New York, the oldest of five children, to Frances Stiles and Edward Austin Sheldon. Her father was the founder of the Oswego State Normal and Training School, known for its Pestalozzian principles. Her upbringing drastically deviated from traditional nineteenth- century norms, as both her parents encouraged scholarly education and fostered her inquisitive spirit. Sheldon attended Oswego public schools and a dual program at Oswego Normal, graduating in 1869 as a certified teacher with specialized training in classical studies. After graduation, she taught there for two years, before becoming enrolled in the first coeducational class at University of Michigan in 1871. Sheldon was a founding member of the Quadrantic Circle, a precursor to sororities. While at Michigan, she studied extensively under the direction of Moses Coit Tyler, a professor of English language and literature within historical and political contexts. She also studied under Charles Kendall Adams, a proponent of the German seminar method of teaching history However, she also took particular interest in the natural sciences. She graduated with an AB in classical studies in 1874. =Teaching and career= Sheldon returned to Oswego State Normal after her graduation to teach history, Latin, Greek and botany. In January 1877 she began teaching at Wellesley College in the English and history departments for two and a half years. Her teaching style was considered unorthodox at the time, using the case method process introduced by her father in the Oswego Movement. Drawing from the teachings of Pestalozzi and Leopold von Ranke, Sheldon encouraged helping students build problem-solving skills while learning historical inquiry. She encouraged her students to move beyond rote memorization. Rather than a textbook, she used a collection of primary source reproductions. With firsthand reading of powerful documents of history, students could generate a dialogue about history‚Äôs biggest questions. However, faculty at Wellesley disapproved of her methods. In 1879 she resigned due to poor health and internal conflicts at the college, leaving behind teaching to travel abroad and rest. In 1882 she returned to Oswego Normal to write her work Studies in General History, which was published in 1885 for secondary-school students. On August 6, 1885 she married Earl Barnes, a former student, who was eleven years her junior. While Barnes taught at various universities, Sheldon concentrated on her writing and collaboration with historian Andrew Dickson White. In 1891 Barnes was appointed head of the department of education at Stanford University, where he implemented her method studies of educational history and child development. In March 1892 Sheldon joined the department of history at Stanford as the first female faculty member. As an assistant professor, she taught 19th-century European and Pacific Slope history. The couple collaborated on Studies in American History which was published in 1891 for eighth-grade students. However, Sheldon owned the copyright to the text. She also conducted research in four California school districts regarding the source method and educational philosophy, through which she designed a history curriculum that accounted for developmental changes. Sheldon would go on to publish Studies in Historical Method, which was directed towards teachers and layman historians interested in learning about historical method. In 1897, the couple resigned from Stanford to travel and write in Europe. Death and legacy Sheldon's health had always been of serious concern, and her chronic illness worsened while abroad. She underwent an unsuccessful new medical procedure to treat an organic heart disease. On August 27, 1898 she died in London. Per her request, Barnes buried her in a Protestant cemetery in Rome. Her teaching method encouraged students to \\"study the primary sources in an 'independent and solitary' way using her questions as guides to problem solving...in order to develop the students abilities to observe, weigh evidence, to generalize and to exercise creative historical imagination.\\" This approach was described as progressive for the time, utilizing a case method that \\"hastened the improvement of more conventional history textbooks.\\" Studies in General History incited debate among leading historians and educators. The American Historical Association's Committee of Seven issued a report in 1899, rejecting Sheldon's approach to teaching. The panel, chaired by Andrew C. McLaughlin, recommended \\"limited contact with a limited body of materials, an examination of which may show the child the nature of the historical process.\\" Though largely ignored in print, her teaching philosophy, especially in relation to critical thinking for students, influenced the curricular structure of general education courses in the mid-twentieth century. However, modern critics of Sheldon's work note her limited sociocultural views and blinding patriotism. In 1985 and 1986, the Mary Sheldon Barnes Papers and Earl Barnes Papers were donated to the Sophia Smith Collection at Smith College by Betty Barnes, the daughter-in-law of Earl Barnes, and his second wife, Anna Koehler Barnes.

The club is also the county's youngest, established in November 2009. The teams catchment area is the South Dublin City suburbs of Rathmines, Ranelagh, Rathgar, Terenure, Donnybrook and Clonskeagh. They currently train in Drimnagh Castle and Stepaside and play their games in Drimnagh Castle. Players can often be found in Vaughans and Bushy Park too.  Club formation  Kilkenny native Liam Lanigan and Conor Droma Cavan, noticed that hurling was poorly catered for in the Ranelagh/Terenure/Rathmines area of the city and decided with some help to try and set up a team. They had hoped to set up a team with Ranelagh Gaels. However, there was not much support from the club. After investigating the prospects of setting up a new club using internet forums the two decided to establish their own club to cater for hurling only. Nine people attended their first meeting in November 2009 and by their maiden game they had nineteen members. They were originally decided on C√∫ Chulainn as the name of the new club but on hearing that there was a Minor Football team in Fingal by the same name called themselves R√©alt Dearg. Their first game was against Commercials of Rathcoole. 2010 and Beyond In their first year the club reached the Junior F Hurling Championship semi final losing out to eventual winners Castleknock. By the time the 2011 season had come around the club's numbers had risen to fifty three. This was due mostly to the club's use of the internet and internet forums and the club's visibility in their catchment area with a poster campaign. The club a has also featured on the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) website and the Evening Herald. While the club has witnessed no problem in recruiting players in it early days getting a coach has proved difficult. The club entered two teams for the 2011 season in Division 8 and 9 and Junior E and F championship. The rise of R√©alt Dearg reflects the change in fortunes of Dublin hurling at both county and inter county level. Since 2008 along with R√©alt Dearg other clubs such as Erin go Bragh, St. Pats of Donabate, Wild Geese, Na Gaeil √ìga CLG have started hurling and the expansion of the Dublin hurling leagues from eight to nine Divisions and an additional Junior hurling championship reflects the interest in the game in Dublin. The club also participated in the Leinster Hurling League. The A team reached the semi finals of the Junior E Hurling Championship losing to Kilmacud Crokes. They were runners up in Division 8 of the league losing in the league final to Clanna Gael/Fontenoy after a replay. The B team reached the quarter final of the Junior F Hurling Championship losing to St. Marks who went on to reach the final. The Club has progressed steadily since then thanks to the work and determination of the players and the various committee's over the years . As of 2019 the Club fields 3 teams operating in the Junior A, Junior E Championships and competing in the AHL 5, AHL 8 and AHL 9 Leagues. The Club has competed in a number of Junior County Finals which has allowed for the progression from humble beginnings of Junior F Championship to currently competing for promotion to the Intermediate Championship. The ethos of the club is to accept every one no matter what skill level and make them part of the hurling community both in the club and in the wider Dublin Hurling Community. The Goal of the Club is to be competitive at senior club hurling with a thriving juvenile section which is currently being actively progressed by the club committee.

Three major land portions, Lalbagh, Kalibagh, and Mamabagh, are occupied by mango trees yielding large amounts of mangoes. Ganwariya Royal Rajput (Parmar Rajput) lives in Sukhpur Dayodhi. The education system of Sukhpur Dayodhi has six schools: High School, Sukhpur; Chetmani Middle school, Sukhpur; Prathmic School, Sukhpur; Harijan School; Sanskrit Madhya Vidyalaya; and Primary Girlsl School. Sukhpur Dayodhi provides school education not only to Sukhpur but also its surrounding villages. Apart from the education the high school has a playground, allowing the villagers to engage in sports such as cricket, football, and volleyball. Land for construction of all these schools was donated by Babu Chetmani Singh family member of Sukhpur Dayodhi. The school name was given in his name i.e. High School, Chetmani Middle School, Primary School, Girls Primary School including playground of High school, Sukhpur. There are many old temples in this village such as Thalha ka Mandir, Thakurbari, Durga Mandir, Shih Dawar, Kali Mandir, Jivach ji mandir. There are a few old historical buildings. Durgapuja is thefestival where grand mela is organised in the village.

He supplied the Royal Household with his instruments and wrote his music in classical style, with a large influence of the baroque. He had two sons, Fran√ßois Joseph Naderman, renowned harpist, and Henri Naderman, harp maker. Life Jean-Henri Naderman was baptised (and presumably born) in Lichtenau in the archdiocese of Paderborn,Droysen-Reber, Doris: \\"Naderman Familie\\", in: Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart (MGG), supplement volume (Kassel: B√§renreiter, 2008), cc. 597‚Äì8. but emigrated to France around 1756 where he began working as a harp manufacturer. Later in 1777 he was licensed to work as a music publisher. He rose to fame when he was commissioned to create and perfect the harps of Queen Marie-Antoinette on her arrival in France, together with the Czech composer and harpist Jean-Baptiste Krumpholtz. The Naderman single-pedal harp is supposed to have been modelled after the successful eighteenth-century Bavarian single-action mechanism pedal harp, whose manufacture, although claimed by several other harp makers including Jean Paul Vetter of Nuremberg and Johann Hausen of Weimar, is often attributed to Jacob Hochbrucker. Today, six harps of this specific model have been located. Jean-Henri Naderman died in Paris.

Definition Maintenance is a form of risk management that is required if and only if an item fails to satisfy the minimum level of specification performance when the items or system is required. Maintenance is optional and may not be required if the partially failed item still satisfies the minimum level of specification performance or if the item is not required for a span of time. Maintenance takes place in four phases. * Failure Detection * Fault isolation * Corrective action * Operational verification An item is said to be degraded when faults exist but normal operation can continue. Automatic recovery is used to avoid the need for maintenance. Automatic recovery from failure is required for systems and resources that cannot be accessed during deployment, such as rockets, missiles, satellites, submersibles, and items that are buried or encapsulated. There are multiple approaches. * Custom items designed specifically for ultra high reliability * Redundant items with reconfiguration features that automatically bypass failure * Lot testing to reduce manufacturing defects Redundant items increase failure rate and reduce reliability if recovery is not automatic. =Failure Detection= Failure Detection involves two different maintenance strategies that interact with life-cycle cost and availability. * Conditional * Periodic Conditional Conditional maintenance relies on indicators that tell users when an item is failed. * System is totally failed and cannot operate as expected * System will function as expected but is degraded This requires automatic fault detection and reporting. Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) requires clearly observable or audible notification that is suitable for unsophisticated and untrained users, which includes the following. * Colored indicator (red or yellow light) * Display showing the phrase failed or degraded next to the item name * Gage with clearly defined green, yellow, and red bands for normal versus faulted * Audible indications, such as a buzzer, bell, or synthesized voice Recovery maintenance actions begin after notification occurs. Items are said to be instrumented when notification takes place automatically upon failure. There are two approaches. * End-To-End (ETE) * Self-reporting devices ETE testing involves an automated process that periodically injects something into the item, then the outputs are examined to determine if they satisfy the level of performance required by the specification. This may be intrusive, and could interfere with normal operation briefly. Self-reporting devices include automatic built-in-test (BIT) features that are less intrusive. Items without the kinds of notifications suitable for CBM have silent failure modes that require periodic preventative maintenance actions. Periodic Probability of operational failure accumulates as time passes until diagnostic or preventative maintenance actions eliminate any actual failures.Operational failure will eventually occur when an item is used in its normal mode of operation if there is no intervention. The procedures associated with periodic maintenance are generally called a Periodic Maintenance System (PMS). There is risk that the system will not work as expected, and this risk grows as time passes due to increasing possibility of silent faults that cause operational failure. Periodic maintenance actions control risk of operational failure. This relies on invasive procedures that renders a system inoperable for a brief period while users run manual diagnostic or preventative procedures. The following are a few examples. * Calibration * Built In Test (BIT) * External Diagnostics (instrumentation) * System Operational Test (SOT) The item is down and is unavailable for normal operation during the time while a periodic maintenance procedure is being performed. Failure is statistical. There is a random chance that the system or item will not function when required. Reliability declines as the time passes, and probability of failure increases until action is taken. The item will eventually fail if there is no intervention. Periodic maintenance increasingly reduces operational failure risks as procedure are used more often. Average reliability improves as the time between maintenance actions is reduced. :Reliability = 0.5 times left( 1 + e^{ left( - lambda times Time  Between  Maintenance  Actions right)} right) As an example, an item with no CBM features will work as expected about 90% of the time if periodic maintenance is performed about 5 times more frequently than the MTBF. :0.9 approx 0.5 times left( 1 + e^{ - 0.2 } right) =Fault Isolation= Fault Isolation is the strategy used to identify the root cause for a failure. There are two methods. * Automatic Fault Isolation * Manual Fault Isolation Automatic Fault Isolation Automatic Fault Isolation identifies the root cause for failure with no manual intervention. This is generally used to control redundant items when it is necessary to automatically bypass failures. Manual Fault Isolation Manual Fault Isolation is when maintenance personnel must identify root cause for a failure. This usually requires the following. * Manual diagnostic tests * Test equipment * Spare parts * Documentation * Training Device instrumentation used with CBM is generally used to reduce the time and effort required to isolate root cause. =Corrective Action= Corrective Action is the activity that restores performance for the item or system after a failure. There are two kinds of corrective action. * Automatic * Manual Automatic Corrective Action Automatic correction is possible for redundant systems when fault-detection, fault-isolation, and fault-bypass are all automatic. Automatic corrective action is also called Active Recovery and Self Healing. This technique can be used to increase the MTBF to the length of time an item will be required to be used without maintenance. As an example, failure is expected for space vehicles that can be required to operate correctly for as much as 10 years in a hostile environment. Redundancy can be achieved by launching a large number of satellites, which is a practical solution for things like the Global Positioning System (GPS) because each vehicle occupies a slightly different orbit. This is not possible for geosynchronous orbit, where all functions must be accomplished by one vehicle that performs all functions must maintain stable position over one specific spot over the earth surface. Satellites intended to operate in geosynchronous orbit must incorporate active recovery that prevents total failure when one or more parts fail. Automatic Corrective Action incorporates all of the spare parts into the design to accommodate all of the failures that can be anticipated during a specific period of time. Manual Corrective Action Manual corrective action is when trained maintenance personnel perform a calibration or replacement action to restore operation. Corrective actions for redundant items includes manual reconfiguration when automatic fault bypass is not available, which depends upon maintenance coverage. Failed part replacement depends upon the Lowest Replaceable Unit (LRU). This could be a part inside an item, or it could be the whole item. This decision is made based on which is less expensive to replace. As an example, a new disk drive costs about $200 to purchase, the technical assistance to replace the disk drive is $500, and a refurbished computer costs about $600. If you replace your own disk drive and install your own operating system, then it is less expensive to purchase the disk drive. If you need technical help then it is less expensive to replace the whole computer. =Operational Verification= Operational Verification is any action that is performed to verify that the item or system is operational. This generally involves using the system in its normal mode of operation, which could involve actual operation or simulated operation. Reliability Maintenance is closely associated with reliability because maintenance is required to restore capability that has been lost due to failure. Electronic devices decay in a way that is mathematically equivalent to radioactive decay processes for unstable atoms. Electronic failure is governed by random processes, where Mean Time Between Failure identifies the average number of hours until failure occurs. Lambda lambda identifies the number of failures expected per hour. : lambda = frac{1}{Mean  Time  Between  Failure} Reliability is the probability that a failure will not occur during a specific span of time. :Reliability = e^left(- lambda times Timeright) :Probability  of  Failure = 1 - Reliability Failure rate relies on logarithmic math to simplify calculations using lambda that is very similar to the type of analysis used for electronic circuits. Overall failure rate for a complex item is the sum of all the failure rates for all of the individual components in the item. This applies to situations where failure of one component causes the entire item to fail. The type of calculation is similar to a series electronic circuit. : lambda = lambda_1 + lambda_2 + ... + lambda_n = sum_{k=1}^N lambda_k Overall failure rate for items with full redundant overlap is the inverse of the sum of MTBF for all of the individual redundant items. This applies to situations where all of the components in the item must all fail before the item fails. The type of calculation is similar to a parallel electronic circuit. : lambda = left( dfrac{1}{ dfrac{1}{lambda_1} + dfrac{1}{lambda_2} + ... + dfrac{1}{lambda_n} } right) = left( dfrac{1}{ sum_{k=1}^N dfrac{1}{lambda_k} } right) A reliability block diagram is used to construct a model for large items. This provides traceability when funding and manpower requirements are identified using reliability calculations. Failure rate for silicon and carbon devices doubles for each 5^oC temperature rise. Electronic devices operating at 60^oC will fail 64 times more frequently than the same kind of items operating at 30^oC. This relationship holds true above 25^oC. Transportation reliability is similar, but values are expressed in terms of distance, such as fault per mile or faults per kilometer. Failure rate can be expressed in terms of the number of cycles. Thermal shock caused by heating and cooling can induce failure when power is cycled on and off. Most mechanical switches are built to operate 10,000 cycles before failure, which is about 30 years for a cycle rate of 1 action per day. Distance, cycle, and decay reliability all have separate contributions that effect the overall failure rate. Availability Availability is generally used with systems that incorporate periodic maintenance. Availability is the probability that an item will operate correctly during a period of time when used at random times during that period. : Availability = frac{Available  Time}{Total  Time} : Total  Time = Available  Time + Down  Time : Down  Time = Maintenance  Time + Faulted  Time Available time is the time while the system is fully operational. Down time is the time while the system is unavailable for normal use, and this consist of the time while periodic maintenance is being performed and the amount of time while the system is faulted. Availability calculations are meaningful for items with replaceable parts only when failure modes have adequate coverage. ::Coverage > Availability Readiness Readiness is meaningful when the item does not require down time for periodic maintenance. This is a useful measurement for items that incorporate automatic recovery or condition based maintenance. Readiness is the probability that an item will operate as expected when used at any random time while the item is in the correct mode of operation. :Readiness = 1 - lambda times Mean  Time  To  Recover Mean Time To Recover form manual actions is generally measured or estimated. The following is an example of the kind of values that could be used for estimating the mechanical portion of the recovery time associated with replacing a failed circuit card. * Static wrist strap : 120 seconds * Bolts and screws with captive nut : remove 15 seconds; replace 30 seconds * Bolts and screws with loose nut : remove 30 seconds; replace 60 seconds * Small cables : disconnect 15 seconds; reconnect 60 seconds * Circuit card : remove 30 seconds; insert 120 seconds Readiness calculations are meaningful for items with replaceable parts only when failure modes have adequate coverage. ::Coverage > Readiness Coverage Maintenance coverage evaluates the proportion of faults detected by CBM and PMS. : Coverage = frac{Faults  Detected  By  CBM + Faults  Detected  By  PMS}{Total  Possible  Faults} A rough estimate of coverage can be made by observing the ratio between operational failures and maintenance actions. : Coverage approx frac{Total  Faults  Excluding  Operational  Failure}{Total  Faults  Including  Operational  Failure} Availability calculations, readiness calculations, and related claims are only valid if coverage exceeds availability. Military Versus Commercial Military maintenance philosophy versus commercial.Military systems and large commercial systems share reliability constraints. The ability to for a military system to continue operating after battle damage is survivability. Military Maintenance Policy (MMP) is required for defense systems. Designs typically include redundancy with automatic fault detection, automatic fault isolation, and automatic fault bypass. These reconfigure systems without human intervention after combat damage and normal failure. Most Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) items are deployed in a benign environment, but electronic devices fail much like constant random battle damage. This effect grows worse as size grows. Excessive down-time is a type of design defect that impacts all large systems. As an example, if a system is built from 1,000 individual computers each with a 3-year Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF), then the whole system will have an MTBF of 1 day. If Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) is 3 days, then the system will never work. If the same system includes 1,010 computers, then failure will be rare if the system includes automatic fault detection, automatic fault isolation, and automatic fault bypass. This shows why large commercial systems require the same kind of maintenance philosophy as military systems.

Taylor was a right-handed batsman who bowled leg break googly. He was born in Leicester, Leicestershire. Taylor made his first-class debut for Leicestershire against Sussex in the 1922 County Championship, after completing five seasons in the First XI at Westminster School. His school record in his final year was among the very strongest in the country, and he took six wickets when Charterhouse were dismissed before lunch for 25 on a plum wicket at Vincent Square. That autumn he began reading Classics at Christ Church, Oxford, and the following summer made his first-class debut for Oxford University Cricket Club against Lancashire. He made history in this year by becoming the first freshman to score a century in The University Match, making 109 against Cambridge University. He gained his Oxford Blue in the 1923 season. Taylor went on to make 42 first-class appearances for the university, the last of which came against Cambridge University in 1926. During his time playing for Oxford, Taylor scored 2,018 runs at an average of 28.42, making 5 half centuries and 5 centuries, with a top score of 115. This score came against Sussex in 1923. As an occasional bowler, Taylor took 14 wickets at a bowling average of 34.07, with best figures of 2/9. While studying at Oxford, Taylor continued to play for Leicestershire at the end of each academic year. In 1924, when he played the second half of the season for Leicestershire, Taylor was notable for being the only Leicestershire batsman to score a century in that season, when he scored 123 against Hampshire at the County Ground, Southampton. He continued to play for Leicestershire until the end of the 1927 season, by which time he had made 45 first-class appearances for the county. In these, he had scored 1,327 runs at an average of 21.06, with three half centuries and four centuries, with his highest score being the 123 he made against Hampshire in 1924. With the ball, his occasional leg spin took 7 wickets at an average of 56.71, with best figures of 2/6. He also appeared in a single first-class match for the Free Foresters in 1927 against his former university. Taylor would appear in minor county cricket nearly twenty years later, appearing for Buckinghamshire after World War II, with his debut coming against Dorset in the 1946 Minor Counties Championship. He made 15 further Minor Counties Championship appearances for Buckinghamshire, the last of which came against Bedforshire in 1947. On occasion he also captained Buckinghamshire. For many years he was a schoolmaster at Eton College, where Henry Blofeld was among the pupils he coached. Along with Buckinghamshire team-mate and fellow Eton master David Macindoe, he was the joint-author of the book Cricket Dialogue. He died in Sherfield on Loddon, Hampshire on 28 January 1966.

Biography Early operating system command-line interfaces were implemented as part of resident monitor programs, and could not easily be replaced. In 1964, MIT Computation Center staff member Louis Pouzin developed the RUNCOM tool for executing command scripts while allowing argument substitution. Pouzin coined the term \\"shell\\" to describe the technique of using commands like a programming language, and wrote a paper describing how to implement the idea in the Multics operating system. Pouzin returned to his native France in 1965, and Schroeder developed the first Multics shell with the assistance of an unnamed man from General Electric. Schroeder's Multics shell was the predecessor to the Unix shell, which is still in use today. Working with Pat Crisman and Louis Pouzin, she also described an early e-mail system called \\"MAIL\\" to allow users on the Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS) at MIT to send notifications to others about backups of files. Each user's messages would be added to a local file called \\"MAIL BOX\\", which would have a ‚Äúprivate‚Äù mode so that only the owner could read or delete messages. The proposed uses of the proto-email system were for communication from CTSS to notify users that files had been backed up, discussion between authors of CTSS commands, and communication from command authors to the CTSS manual editor. The service only made it possible to leave messages for the other users on the same computer. The idea to allow users to send messages between computers was developed later by Ray Tomlinson in 1971.

Two senior Soviet military leaders served with the division in its early years; Vasily Konstantinovich Blucher, later famous for his commands in the Far East, commanded the division from 22 September 1918 to 15 January 1919, and Konstantin Rokossovsky, later Marshal of the Soviet Union, commanded one of the division's regiments in 1919‚Äì1920. In 1939, based on 30th Rifle Division units, the 132nd Rifle Division and 176th Rifle Division were created. Subsequently, the division was reformed as the 30th Mountain Rifle Division and began World War II under this name. The division was renamed the 30th Rifle Division on 25 August 1941. The division was part of the 'operational army' from 22 June 1941 to 18 December 1942. On 22 June 1941, the division was stationed at the Soviet-Romanian border on the river Prut at Sculeni (Calarasi, Frontier District Number 5). The division was part of the 35th Rifle Corps of the 9th Army. On 24 June 1941 the division had entered the battle and was forced to retreat on 30 June 1941. The division held the line of Vnishora, German, and Petreshtipri. During the disorganized retreat the division lost much equipment and personnel. On 5 July the division held positions at the front from Popovka to Lipovanka. On 7 July 1941 the division was in reserve. Up to 11 July, the division numbered no more than one regiment. On 6 August 1941, the division was transferred to the Separate Coastal Army, which was entrusted with the defense of Odessa, but before managing to link up with the Separate Coastal Army, the division was cut off, without linking up with the main forces of the army, and was forced to withdraw to the Southern Bug River. Then the division was involved in defensive and offensive battles on the Rostov axis, holding the line on the river Mius. In January 1942 the division crossed the Mius and in March 1942 participated in the attack on Taganrog. From the second half of July 1942 the division conducted a fighting retreat in the Caucasus. On 25 July, after covering the crossing of the Don in the Azov area for three days, the division defended positions in the area of Krasnodar. On 12 August the division was forced to retreat from Krasnodar. In August, the division defended near Goryachy Klyuch. The division fought in the Tuapse Defensive Operation. By 20 August 1942 the division covered the road through the Pyatigorsk and Khrebtovy passes, After a lull in the fighting, which lasted until 23 September 1942, the division was again involved in heavy fighting. By the end of October the 30th Rifle Division held the line in the Kaverze River valley, covering the Khrebtovy Pass. On 12 December 1942 the division was transformed into the 55th Guards Rifle Division as a reward for its actions. The Second Formation of the 30th Rifle Division was recreated at Rossosh in April 1943. It fought at Rostov, Kiev, Zhitomir, and in the Carpathian Mountains. It was with 38th Army of the 4th Ukrainian Front in May 1945.Source probably Poirer and Conner, Red Army order of battle. See List of infantry divisions of the Soviet Union 1917-1957.

Life and work Hochbrucker was probably born in Mindelheim.Tremmel (2003), see above. From 1699 he lived and worked in Donauw√∂rth, where he also built lutes and violas. Around 1720 Hochbrucker invented the pedal mechanism to play the harp, adding to the instrument five (later increased to seven) pedals and connecting them to the hooks for the C, D, F, G, and B strings, thus allowing the player to alter the strings sound of a semitone and greatly extend the range of the instrument for the extraction of sounds. This ingenious chromatic system later became the subject matter of studies and extended considerations. In the second half of the 18th century, the Hochbrucker mechanism was largely popularized by the efforts of his nephews, Christian and Celestine Hochbrucker, and mainly by his son Simon, who toured around Europe playing in Vienna in 1729, Leipzig, Brussels in 1734, Paris in 1740 and north Germany. At the beginning of the 19th century S√©bastien √ârard constructed in Paris the \\"harpe √† double mouvement\\", patented in 1810, finally changing so the course of that which Hochbrucker had successfully developed.

Early life Drummond was born on 12 February 1744 at Lundin, Fife as James Lundin.Sir James Balfour Paul, The Scots Peerage, vol. VII, Edinburgh 1910, p. 57-59 He was the son of James Lundin (1707‚Äì1781) and the former Lady Rachel Bruce (d. 1769), a daughter of Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Kincardine. His elder sister, Veronica Drummond, married Duncan Campbell of Kames, and his elder brother, was Thomas Drummond, Lord Drummond. The Lundins descended from Thomas de Lundin, a natural son of King William the Lion. James' paternal grandparents were Robert Lundin (1675‚Äì1716) and Anne Inglis (a daughter of Sir James Inglis of Cramond). His grandfather Robert was a younger son of John Drummond, 1st Earl of Melfort (younger son of the 3rd Earl of Perth) by his first wife, Sophia Maitland. Sophia, his great-grandmother, had inherited Lundin from her brother John Lundin of Lundin, both children of Margaret (n√©e Lundin) Maitland and Robert Maitland (a younger son of John Maitland, 1st Earl of Lauderdale). Sophia's mother Margaret had inherited the Lundin estates upon the death of her father, John Lundin of Lundin, in 1684. Career The younger James Lundin, now also known as Drummond, joined the British Army in 1771. On 2 September 1780 he was promoted to Captain in the 2nd Battalion 42nd Highlanders, and served with the Battalion in India. =Claim to the Earldom of Perth= On 6 February 1760, following the death of Edward Drummond, sixth Jacobite-jurisdiction Duke of Perth, James' father became heir to the Earldom of Perth, which had been forfeit since 1716 owing to the attainder of James Drummond, 2nd Duke of Perth (The first Earl of Melfort was the younger son of James Drummond, 3rd Earl of Perth). His father, therefore, assumed the surname of Drummond and styled himself 10th Earl of Perth, and in 1776, following the death of Jean Drummond, Duchess of Perth in 1773, he took up residence at the Drummond estate of Stobhall in Perthshire. Upon his father's death on 18 July 1781, James succeeded to his father's claim to the Earldom of Perth (his elder brother Thomas, who moved to America, had died the previous November), but did not use the title.Marquis of Ruvigny and Raineval, The Jacobite Peerage, Edinburgh 1904, p. 148 In 1784, an Act was passed allowing the Crown to grant to the heirs-male the estates that had been forfeited in 1745, and on 8 March 1785 the Court of Session declared that he was the person entitled to the Drummond estates (including Drummond Castle), which he was duly granted. He submitted a claim to be Earl of Perth in 1792, but withdrew it in 1796, and on 26 October 1797 was created a Peer of Great Britain as Lord Perth, Baron Drummond of Stobhall in the County of Perth. Personal life On 31 March 1785, Drummond was married to the Hon. Clementina Elphinstone (1749‚Äì1822) in Edinburgh. Clementina was a daughter of Charles Elphinstone, 10th Lord Elphinstone and Lady Clementina Fleming (daughter of John Fleming, 6th Earl of Wigton). Together, they were the parents of three children: * James Drummond (1791‚Äì1799), who died in childhood. * Clementina Sarah Drummond (1786‚Äì1865), who married Peter Robert Burrell on 20 October 1807; they adopted the surname of Drummond in addition to that of Burrell by Royal Licence on 6 November that year. He succeeded his father as Baron Gwydyr in 1820 and his mother as Baron Willoughby de Eresby in 1828. As the Hon. Mrs Drummond Burrell she was one of the Lady Patronesses of Almack's in 1814 as described in Captain Gronow's memoirs. * Jemima Rachel Drummond (1787‚Äì1788), who died in infancy. Lord Perth died at Innerpeffray on 2 July 1800, at which point the Barony of 1797 became extinct. =Legacy= After Lord Perth's death, the claim to the Earldom of Perth was inherited by the line of the titular Dukes of Melfort, for whom it was restored on 28 June 1853, before being inherited by the Viscounts Strathallan on 28 February 1902. Lundin had been sold to Sir William Erskine of Torry before his death, and was later inherited by James Erskine Wemyss (Lundin House was demolished in 1876, but its Tower remains today). The Drummond estates were inherited under a settlement of 9 June 1800 by his daughter Clementina and her heirs. In 1953, Stobhall was passed by her descendant James Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby, 3rd Earl of Ancaster to the heir-male John Drummond, 8th Earl of Perth (1907‚Äì2002), while Drummond Castle remains a seat of Jane Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby, 28th Baroness Willoughby de Eresby (b. 1934).

Originally formed in April 2011 in the opposition stronghold of Benghazi, it later relocated to the Nafusa Mountains, then the closest frontline to Tripoli, before advancing into the city itself in August. In November 2011, the brigade began taking measures to disband and integrate itself more with the N.T.C.'s new national army, the brigade announced over its Twitter account. Commanders The brigade's Commander-in-Chief is Libyan-Irish citizen Mahdi al-Harati, Khalid Abozakkar is deputy commander and co founder in [Nalut], and Abu Oweis is deputy commander. Muhammad Tabouni is the brigade's General Commander. Col Abdul Latif is the commander of Seraai al-Hamra, one of the four sub-brigades of the overall Tripoli Brigade. Foundation In February 2011 Mahdi al-Harati travelled from Ireland to Benghazi and began to create a well-organised group that could fight in the western provinces of Libya. He gathered 15 highly educated men, all of whom had extensive expertise and skills. The proposal for a Tripoli revolutionary brigade was put before the Benghazi-based National Transitional Council, and was immediately approved. Within days the Tripoli Brigade had 150 recruits. They received basic military training before transferring to the mountains in the western provinces. By August 2011, the brigade had 570 men from all over the country within its ranks. The brigade started with a core group of 15 men, but grew within days to 150, during the training period in Zintan and Nalut numbers swelled to 470, and was recorded at 570 at Zawiya. During the assault to enter Tripoli the brigade was reported in the UK Telegraph newspaper to number just under 1,000. On 30 August the brigade had swelled to 1300 fighters in Tripoli. Its General commander also stated that it had troops waiting to join once the brigade entered Tripoli. The majority of the brigade's volunteer fighters are from Tripoli, or nearby towns and villages, and know the city streets well, making them prime candidates for taking the city. Based in Nalut University, the brigade numbers about 1300 armed fighters. The brigade saw action throughout the 2011 Nafusa Mountains Campaign including in the towns of Nalut, Bir Ghanem and Tiji, in combat against loyalist forces. Due to the threat of perceived reprisals against the families of Tripoli brigade soldiers, their faces must be covered, at least when being filmed by journalists. Many of the brigade's members were involved during the 2011 Tripoli clashes in February, and fled the capital to avoid loyalist forces, and then regrouped in later months to form the Tripoli Brigade, with the ultimate goal of advancing out of the Nafusa Mountain range, and to the capital. The brigade has several officers who have lived most of their lives in English speaking countries including Ireland, Canada, UK and the US. This proved vital with co-ordination with NATO and also in interviews and interaction with western media. The Brigade has an English language Facebook page. Training Although the Brigade is not an elite force, its Nalut headquarters was described by AP news agency as 'high tech'. It did receive communications equipment and three-week's urban warfare training from Qatari special forces in the Nafusa mountains. It is noted for its extreme training; during which recruits woke at 5:30 a.m. for a 45-minute run, followed by daylong marching and weapons training. The brigade has also created an eight-man urban sniper unit. The brigade is often referred to as an elite brigade by the National Transitional Council and the media. This is not an accurate description as very few are professional soldiers. In a media interview in Tripoli, Commander Harati said his battalion is not an elite armed force and that it is \\"important to understand that we are all civilians. We are not the military\\". The enrolling register counts many professionals among its members including doctors, businessmen, mechanics, engineers, and web designers. Battle of Tripoli Their main aim, once in control of Tripoli, was to control and protect strategic locations, infrastructure and other important sites. On 20 August, a large uprising broke out in Tripoli, with rebel forces speeding towards the capital from the west and the east. The Tripoli Brigade was the spearhead of the rebel fighters assault on Tripoli. In a 32 kilometer push launched at dawn, the Tripoli Brigade reached the suburbs of Tripoli by early afternoon following a non-stop artillery shelling of advancing rebel troops. In response a large anti-aircraft artillery piece fired rounds at loyalist troops. The Tripoli Brigade took a key military base and the 27th bridge, a gateway to the capital, just a day after defeating loyalist troops in Zawiya. Divided into four battalions the Brigade attacked the capital from three directions. The only impediment to a rush into the capital was on another front line, outside the town of Azizia, the Tripoli Brigade and allies from the western mountain forces were ordered to hold back while the alliance carried out heavy bombing raids on loyalist positions there. The Tripoli Brigade were reported to be the first revolutionaries to enter the city and the first to enter the main Green Square, that was renamed Martyr Square. On entering Tripoli the Tripoli Brigade took command of the Women's police training centre as their headquarters. The Tripoli Brigade, alongside rebel forces from Misrata, were also the first to punch through the main gates of Gaddafi's former residence, Bab al Azizia. The UK Daily Telegraph reported of the brigade \\"The rebels pushing into Tripoli are young professionals fighting to establish a very different country from the dictatorship founded well before they were born\\". France 24 TV channel had a reporter travelling with the Tripoli Brigade during the final assault on the capital. It reported that the brigade lost sixty fighters during the first 48 hours in Tripoli. The Tripoli brigade were front-line troops during the taking of Colonel Gaddafi's famous residential compound, Bab al Azizia. Officers from the Tripoli Brigade were reported as leading the attack. The Misrata Brigade with heavier trucks and artillery guns broke the perimeter of the compound and the Tripoli Brigade provided the infantry that flooded through the breached walls. An English reporter quoted in the Irish Times spoke of the Commander- in-chief 'rallying the troops' during the storming at the compound. The brigade's website reported that its media team had to take up rifles during this attack in which they took 100 prisoners. =Activities after the Battle of Tripoli= In the weeks after the fall of the Gaddafi Government in Tripoli the brigade took a major role in the securing the city and clearing it of the few remaining pockets of resistance. The commander of the brigade was appointed second in command of the newly formed Tripoli Military council. This council's aim is to unify the country's various armed brigades. Mahdi al- Harati said that Khamis Gaddafi was killed after a military battle with Tripoli Military Council forces between the villages of Taruna and Bani Walid. The battleground is in north-west Libya, near Misrata. He stated Khamis was taken to a hospital where he died from his injuries. He was then reportedly buried in the area by rebel forces. There was no independent evidence to support the claim. The brigade has been guarding Tripoli's airports, as well as the hotels of foreign journalists and diplomats since they took the city. On 5 October, a new batch of recruits successfully graduated and became part of the Tripoli Brigade. The same day, the head of the brigade announced that two mass graves had been uncovered in and around Tripoli containing up 900 bodies of Gaddafi's opponents. On 10 October, members of the Kekka Brigade from Zintan, attempted to surround some of the Tripoli Brigade, after a heated argument over who should police Tripoli and attempted to prevent them from leaving the area. Tripoli Brigade reinforcements arrived and convinced the Kekka brigade to withdraw, preventing any armed clashes breaking out. Fighting broke out on 31 October between the Tripoli Brigade and a brigade from Zintan when the Zintanians attempted to enter a hospital and kill a patient they had shot earlier in the day. Tripoli Brigade guards prevented them from doing so and a firefight broke out which left two dead and seven wounded, Members of the brigade also volunteered to join the side of the anti-Assad rebels in Syria during the Syrian civil war in 2012. Noted members The brigade's Commander-in-Chief is a Libyan-Irish citizen Colonel Mahdi al-Harati. He was described by the Dutch daily newspaper Volkskrant as being a face of the battle of Tripoli and one of the most important commanders in the National Liberation Army. Deputy chief of Tripoli Military Council. He resigned from his post in November 2011. Abu Oweis acts as deputy commander.

He was also a member of the governing board of the adjacent National Park while he lived at Belair. Hamilton made his money from land speculation and lost significant sums later on Yorke Peninsula land. The estate was extensive in his time, extending all the way to Brownhill Creek, and west to James Road and Old Belair Rd. His brother built the smaller house to the east on a corner of the estate, and Hamilton donated the land for the Church of the Holy Innocents to be built. On his death in 1917, the estate was vacant for some time until bought by Gil Culley, an architect who divided the land, converting the stables to an asymmetric Tudor bungalow and attaching the name \\"Willa Willa\\" to that house. The coach house was converted to a home, but the infills for the coach stall doors can still be seen. The whole of the house and its ancillary buildings were connected by an internal road parallel to Sheoak Rd, of which traces are still visible. =ca.1919-1925 - William Burford= The balance of the estate was later bought by William Burford, but was initially used as a summer residence only as the family's main home was on the foreshore at Glenelg. It was they who renamed it Birralee, a name which occurs frequently in connection with the Burfords and W. H. Burford & Sons, their major soap and candle manufacturing enterprises. This business, which was Australia wide, later became a part of Lever and Kitchen. =1925-1942 - Burford family= After Burford's death in 1925, various of his children, and/or their families, continued living in the house.

(May 1992) On 1 April 1942, Australian Army officer Captain Lewis, together with two U.S. Army officers, arrived at Scotch College in Torrens Park and informed the Headmaster that they wished to inspect the college and its facilities to determine its suitability as an American army hospital. Lewis recommended that the American Army take possession of the college from 8 May (at the end of first term) until the cessation of hostilities. After considerable searching and investigation, two adjacent houses at Belair, Birralee and Brierley Lodge, were discovered, inspected and found to be suitable. It appears to have become accepted wisdom that Brierly Lodge was the house to the east of Birralee which was built by TKHamilton's brother, but according to the Scotch College old boys, it was the asymmetric Tudor bungalow to the west as modified by Culley and now named Willa Willa. The old boys tell of having the dorm on the open back balcony facing the city. The move from Torrens Park to Belair was executed during the school holidays, and the boarders and domestic staff moved in during the first week of second term. Four large marquees with wooden floors were erected on the drives and front lawns of the properties as classrooms. The arrival of 176 students, including 66 boarders, and 14 resident staff, \\"put a great strain on the water supply, the plumbing and the septic tanks\\".Peter Read, Alex Pouw-Bray (2010) \\"Ninety Years at Torrens Park: The Scotch College Story\\", pp47, 51-57, Wakefield Press Within a few weeks of the move to Belair, the tide of war in the Pacific turned with the allied naval victory at the Battle of the Coral Sea in May 1942. The American military hospital never eventuated - \\"The Americans hauled down the stars and stripes at Torrens Park on 15 August\\". However, they were replaced by the Royal Australian Air Force, and the Torrens Park site became \\"RAAF Embarkation Depot No.4\\". In 1943, the tide of war changed again, and the college council asked the RAAF if it could look forward to the college reopening at Torrens Park in 1944. As late as 6 January 1944 the RAAF had still not made a decision, but the college council took \\"direct action\\" and the RAAF vacated by 15 January. Teaching resumed at Torrens Park on 15 February 1944.Pictures of Birralee, Belair in 1942 can be found on the following pages of the Read & Pouw-Bray book: * pg.51 (1942) - The view from the north facing balcony of Birralee * pg.52 (1942) - The entrance to Birralee on Florence Street (now Sheoak Road) * pg.52 (1942) - The Science Laboratory at Birralee * pg.53 (1942) - The Senior Boarders Common Room at Birralee * pg.54 (1942) - The north face of Birralee * pg.55 (1942) - The Boarders Dining Room at Birralee =1944-1952 - Belair TB Sanatorium= After the war, the Burfords/Parks/Robertsons/Beales were offered the place again, but declined because of the major changes which had been made to render the place suitable for a school, (some of which, like the ablution block attached to the base of the tower, were really disfiguring.) In February 1944, the Minister for Repatriation inspected proposed sites for the new TB Sanatorium. The President of the RSA, Major Millhouse, urged the Minister to acquire property at Birralee, Belair, which was formerly occupied by Scotch College. The Minister inspected the site and said that he was favourably impressed.The Sanatorium Site, \\"What is happening in your home state\\", Army News (Darwin, NT), 15 February 1944, p.2 The Repatriation Sanatorium was opened on 2 June 1945 by His Excellency the Governor, Sir Willoughby Norrie.Governor to open Belair Sanatorium, The Advertiser, Friday 1 June 1945, p.3 =1952-1976 - Repatriation Hospital \\"Birralee\\"= In the period 1 Jan 1952 ‚Äì 31 Dec 1976, the house was known as Repatriation Hospital \\"Birralee\\". =1980s= In the 1980s, it was used as a drug and alcohol rehabilitation centre, named St Anthony's. =Recent times= The well maintained beautiful house, located in well maintained grounds, is now once again a private home, currently belonging to Hans Ehmann and Valmai Spicer. =2011= { - valign=bottom  250px Main entrance  250px Looking North over the Adelaide Plains  250px West face - valign=bottom  250px Rear (North face)  250px Front (South face)  250px Front (South face) } Birralee, Glenelg Glenelg) ca.1890 It is not clear when the house was built, or who built it.

As such, Topgay Dorji was responsible for fostering Anglo-Bhutanese relations, and later, Bhutan‚ÄìIndia relations. Topgay's ties with the west and modernist political factions contributed significantly to the modern political landscape and modernization of Bhutan. Topgay Dorji inherited his positions from his father, Kazi Ugyen Dorji, who was instrumental in advising Ugyen Wangchuck before and after he became the First King of Bhutan. Topgay Dorji lived, worked, and died at Bhutan House, the Dorji's estate in Kalimpong, India, the traditional administrative center of southern Bhutan. Family Topgay was the son of Gongzim Ugyen Dorji, adviser to Gongsar Ugyen Wangchuck both before and after the rise of the latter to the throne. Gongzim Ugen Dorji had advised the future First King to mediate between the British and Tibet, and later to allow the large-scale induction of Nepalis into Bhutan establishing friendly ties with British India. His paternal aunt was Ayi Thubten Wangmo. Topgay Raja married Princess Mayum Choying Wangmo, the youngest daughter of the Sikkimese Chogyal, at Bhutan House on April 5, 1918. Together they had three sons and two daughters. His eldest son was Jigme Palden Dorji, born in 1919. He went on to become Governor of Haa in 1924, and then to succeed his father as the first Prime Minister of Bhutan. Jigme Palden Dorji was assassinated amid a political struggle between modernist pro-Dorji and monarchist pro-Wangchuck factions. Topgay's second son was named Ugyen, born in 1933. Ugyen was recognized as a renowned lama at Bhutan House as a young boy. This lama was a strong influence in Tibet and Mongolia.Bhutan Society He was thereafter called Ugyen Rimpoche, or Boedhay Rimpoche. The youngest son was Lhendup \\"Lenny\\" Dorji, born October 6, 1935. Lhendup served briefly as Acting Prime Minister in 1964. That year, he went into voluntary exile in Nepal and later settled at Kalimpong. Topgay's elder daughter Ashi Tashi Dorji served as the Gyaltshab (King's Representative / Regent) of Eastern Bhutan. In 1964, she accompanied Lhendup into voluntary exile, though she returned to Bhutan in 1972. On October 5, 1951, Topgay's younger daughter Ashi Kesang Choden Dorji married the Third King Jigme Dorji Wangchuck, creating a new bond so prominent as to cause some discontent among other Bhutanese families. Topgay is thus an ancestor of the current Fifth King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck. Life Insignia of the Order of the Indian Empire. In 1917, Topgay assumed his father's positions as Gongzim (Chief Minister) and Trade Agent to the Government of Bhutan, however he functioned to a large extent as prime minister, foreign minister, and ambassador to India. Topgay, though young at around 21 years of age, thus became the First King Ugyen Wangchuck's closest adviser. Administering from Bhutan House, Sonam Topgay Dorji was also Governor of Haa, directly abutting the estate, between 1917 and 1924. Through his position as trade intermediary, Topgay and the Dorji family amassed wealth reputedly greater than that of the royal family. He and his family also supported Western education of Bhutanese youths, paving the way for later educational reforms under the Third King. On April 23, 1948, Topgay Dorji headed the Bhutanese delegation to recently independent India, meeting Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. Topgay and Nehru established Bhutan‚ÄìIndia relations, prompted by a growing security concern over Communist China. Bilateral negotiations lasted through August 8, 1949, culminating in the Indo-Bhutan Treaty, replacing the defunct Treaty of Punakha. Under the new agreement, India returned the land around Deothang, subject of part of the 1865 Anglo-Bhutanese War. Throughout his career, Raja Sonam Topgay Dorji garnered several foreign honors. In 1917, he was granted the titles of Rai Bahadur and Raja by King George V. In 1918, he was made Deputy Minister (Kashag officer of the fourth rank) by the Thirteenth Dalai Lama of Tibet. Topgay was further created a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire (CIE) on June 8, 1944. Death Topgay Dorji died suddenly at Bhutan House in September 1953, without having been ill in any way. The event seemed to symbolize a dark cloud of misfortune for the Dorji family, which they blamed on a curse.

The mansion was built by Benjamin Burford in 1900 on 4.5 acres (1.8ha) at 120 Kensington Road, in what was then Rose Park, (an inner eastern suburb of Adelaide, South Australia). Containing 14 rooms, the two storey house is the largest and most extravagant mansion built in the area that became known as the suburb of Toorak Gardens. With Burford's death in 1905, the property was bought by an investor from Broken Hill, Otto Georg Ludwig von Rieben.

Launched in 1969 by the Institute of Race Relations, it was from 1973 published by the Race Today Collective, which included figures such as Darcus Howe, Farrukh Dhondy, Linton Kwesi Johnson and Leila Hassan. The magazine was a leading organ of Black politics in 1970s Britain; publication ended in 1988. __TOC__ History Race Today was established in 1969 by the Institute of Race Relations. From 1973 onward, the monthly magazine was under the direction of a breakaway organisation, the Brixton-based Race Today Collective. This body aimed for a political rather than scholarly approach, based on a combination of libertarian Marxism and radical anti-racism. The magazine's first editor under the new leadership was journalist and broadcaster Darcus Howe. Howe was much influenced by Trinidadian Marxist C. L. R. James, and under his tenure Race Today became a leading voice of Black political journalism in Britain. (James would later live his final years in the building that housed the office of Race Today, at 165 Railton Road in Brixton, where a blue plaque was installed by English Heritage in 2004.)\\"Darcus Howe ‚Äì fighter for Black people‚Äôs rights\\", Brixton Blog, 2 April 2017.\\"CLR James  Writer  Blue Plaques\\".

A compilation of Howe's arguments in Race Today appeared in a 1978 pamphlet entitled The Road Make to Walk on Carnival Day. Farrukh Dhondy, later the author of a biography of C. L. R. James, began his writing career with Race Today in 1970. Another notable member of the Race Today Collective was Linton Kwesi Johnson, who joined the group in 1974. His first book of poems appeared the same year under the Race Today imprint, and he later served as the magazine's arts editor. The publication and its editor feature prominently in the song \\"Man Free (For Darcus Howe)\\" on Linton Kwesi Johnson's 1978 debut album Dread Beat an' Blood with his then band Poet and the Roots. In the mid-1970, the Race Today Collective allied with the Black Panther Movement formed by John La Rose, who had been the chairman of the Institute of Race Relations in 1972 and 1973. In 1978, the magazine's publication frequency changed from monthly to bimonthly. In 1985, Leila Hassan became the journal's editor; both the magazine and the Race Today Collective were discontinued in 1988. Described as \\"the most articulate organ of British Black politics in the 1970s\\", Race Today maintained close ties to the Notting Hill Carnival.

It was developed to provide superior protection and capabilities for United States military personnel. It was designed, developed and built by private American company Juliet Marine Systems. History Inventor Gregory Sancoff had decided to focus on small watercraft following the attack on USS Cole in 2000, after which he recalled saying: \\"Some yahoo terrorists in a cheap little boat and $500 worth of explosives can kill 17 sailors on a billion-dollar ship?\\" He also came across a 630-page United States Navy report on an exercise called Juliet, where the Navy attacked an enemy force of small, high-speed boats; after two days, the Navy had suffered over 20,000 simulated casualties. Sancoff gathered information on marine technology, including hydroplane racing boats and high-speed supercavitating torpedoes. In 2007, Sancoff founded Juliet Marine Systems, named after the Navy exercise that inspired him, and began work on a plywood hull mock-up at Portsmouth, New Hampshire. In October 2009, Sancoff's patent attorney received a letter from the United States Patent and Trademark Office, with a recommendation from the Office of Naval Research (ONR), enforcing a secrecy order forbidding Juliet Marine from filing its patents internationally or speaking about its technology; the secrecy orders were lifted in 2011. Prototype trial runs were conducted at night; the main hull section failed to lift out of the water on its first dozen runs, it first successfully lifted in 2011, reaching roughly high. Trials revealed the vessel's smoothness, traversing high waves without the crew feeling much motion sickness, unlike those onboard an accompanying chase boat. In 2014, Sancoff declared he was \\"aware\\" of the Department of Defense's apprehension to working with startup companies. The Navy has a policy of only buying technologies of an announced interest and cannot procure a system without established requirements. In 2009, the Defense Advanced Projects Research Agency (DARPA) expressed interest in funding Ghost; Sancoff rejected this to retain the patent rights. The ONR reportedly produced feedback declaring a lack of trust in the design. He also voiced concerns over potential theft of the design as the patents are publicly available, and repeated attempts to breach the company's computer systems. U.S. allies have expressed interest in Ghost, and Sancoff has said he is willing to make a foreign sale. In September 2014, the United States Department of State permitted Foreign Military Sales discussions with South Korea about Ghost. In 2014, it was reportedly offered to several nations including Bahrain, Qatar, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, and Singapore. High-level discussions were allegedly held with one nation interested in 25 vessels like Ghost in a potential $300 million sale. Juliet Marine also offered a scaled-up corvette-sized Ghost in length during the U.S. Navy's re-evaluation of the Littoral Combat Ship program; costing about $50 million per vessel, it is one sixth the price of the $300+ million per-ship cost of a or s. One impediment to U.S. Navy procurement of Ghost is a preference of senior leaders for large-hulled oceangoing vessels that can also perform inshore operations, instead of smaller craft specialized for inshore missions. Design Ghost uses a dual- pontoon supercavitating hull, known as the small waterplane-area twin-hull (SWATH), to run at top speed through seas. It is gyro-stabilized, control is provided by 22 underwater control surfaces. Below eight knots, Ghost sits in the water on its centerline -long module; faster than this, the marine aluminum buoyant hulls lifts the main hull out of the water by two -long struts, achieving full stability and reducing the amount of area resisting the water. Each strut is attached to a -long underwater tube that contains the engines. Four propellers are at the front of the tubes, which is more stable and allows for better control at high speeds; the propellers funnel air down through the struts, creating a gas bubble around each tube (the cavitation effect) for reduced drag and smooth motion. Propulsion on the prototype is provided by two T53-703 turboshaft engines providing 2,000 horsepower, there are plans to later adopt the General Electric T700 turboshaft engine. Since the tubes that contain the engines, fuel, and most computing systems are underwater, this lessens vulnerability because critical systems are protected by the water itself. The aircraft-style cockpit is outfitted with large windshields fashioned from two inch-thick glass; steering is provided via a throttle and joystick arrangement. Ghost has achieved speeds of over 30 knots, and is being tested to 50 knots. It is called Ghost in recognition of its design, which bears a marked resemblance to the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk, making the craft virtually invisible to radar detection. It can perform several types of missions, including anti-surface warfare (ASuW), anti- submarine warfare (ASW), and mine countermeasures (MCM): ASuW armament consists of the M197 20mm rotary cannon and launch tubes that expel exhaust downward between the struts of the SWATH hulls, concealing and dissipating the thermal signature of the launch for BGM-176B Griffin missiles and Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System rockets, with an electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) sensor and radar; an ASW version could be equipped with an EO/IR sensor, radar, sonobuoy launch tubes, a dipping sonar, and four aft-firing torpedo tubes; an MCM version could be equipped with a towing boom to lower and raise two towed mine-hunting sonars, such as the Kline 5000 or Raytheon AN/AQS-20A. The current Ghost costs $10 million per copy, is crewed by 3-5 sailors, has an endurance of 3 days, and can be partially disassembled to fit in a Boeing C-17 Globemaster III for transport if needed. There is room for 16 passengers with two -diameter round windows in the hull. It is designed for fleet protection for navies with few blue-water needs but require a small and affordable craft in large numbers for near-shore maritime border patrol and defense missions.

He was born in Arlington, Virginia, and currently lives and works in Brooklyn, New York. Within his artistic career, he works both in the natural world and in his studio. His playful interaction with his environment includes small performances and actions that are captured on video. His diverse artistic practice involves working with elemental forces to create durational performative actions. Education Lamson received his undergraduate education at Dartmouth College and graduated with his B.A. in 2000. Soon after, he went on to pursue his M.F.A. at Bard College, graduating in 2006. Career Achievements Over his career, Lamson's work has appeared in ArtForum, Frieze, The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, the New Yorker, Harpers, and The Village Voice. Lamson was named a 2014 Guggenheim Fellow, a MacDowell Fellow, and received grants from the Shifting Foundation and the Experimental Television Center. Artistic Process and Technique As an interdisciplinary artist, Lamson uses a wide range of mediums, including video, photography, performance, and sculpture. In many of his projects, he creates an apparatus or props for the actions within the projects, as well as a set of tools for filming the action too. Despite significant logistical challenges, Lamson says the benefit of working this way is that he knows how everything works once they‚Äôre ready to shoot the video. He builds the props and tools, and operates the camera himself, and budgets multiple days for careful shooting with only one or two assistants. Lamson's thoughtfulness when it comes to the viewer‚Äôs experience and the function of the camera makes an impact in his work that shows through. Set in landscapes as varied as New York's East River and Chile's Atacama Desert, his projects reveal the invisible systems and forces at play within these sites. In all his projects, Lamson's work represents a collaboration with forces outside of his control to explore systems of knowledge and belief. In an interview with Dina Deitsch, a curator, Lamson said that his work is perhaps ‚Äúa move from performing in front of the camera to performing inside of the image-making system itself.‚Äù Exhibitions Lamson's work has been exhibited widely in the United States and Europe. He's been exhibited in the Brooklyn Museum, The Moscow Biennial, P.S.1 MOMA, Kunsthalle Erfurt, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Denver, and Honor Fraser Gallery in Los Angeles. In addition, he has produced site- specific installations for the Indianapolis Museum of Art, the Center For Land Use Interpretation, and Storm King Art Center. His work is in the collections of the Brooklyn Museum, the Dallas Museum of Art, the Indianapolis Museum of Art, the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston, and a number of private collections. Work =Automatic (2009)= Lamson's work, Automatic (2009), is composed of 3 parts, each harnessing either the forces of wind or the sea. He does so by constructing kinetic contraptions that enlist those natural forces to generate pencil or black-pen drawings. Along with the resulting drawings, a video documents the movement of each apparatus responding to their landscape. Together, Sea Drawings, Kite Drawings, and the resulting 7:41 minute video makes up the project Automatic. Lamson records each drawing's creation date, location, and duration of the work's making, in addition to the volume of water in the bottles, as though Lamson were conducting a physics experiment, where exact data is crucial. The precision in his process and documentation suggesting the precariousness of these contraptions, the meticulousness needed to produce a satisfactory outcome. Molino Drawing captured the power of the wind by harnessing the movement of a wind turbine. A string connects a graphite pencil to a moving component of the turbine. Kite Drawing also harnessed the power of the wind through the use of a kite. For this drawing, a marker is attached to a water bottle, which acts a weight for the marker. The kite's string is threaded through a rough wooden tripod, which acts as an anchor for the setup, so that when the wind blew the kite, the marker is moved across sheets of paper taped to a board underneath the setup. The results yielded an expressive pencil or black-pen drawings. Lamson channels nature's indeterminacy, offering the absurd yet fantastical suggestion that the wind is able to draw. Sea Drawings were created in Coliumo, Chile on a cliff side overlooking the Pacific Ocean. Lamson created these drawings by harnessing the power of the sea below, capturing the energy in the rise and fall of waves. To do so there is a water bottle hanging down the side of the cliff being lifted up and down by the swells in waves, this, in turn, interacts with a pulley system of sorts connected to a graphite pencil. Close-ups of the apparatus in action show that the pencil's movements appear oddly purposeful, as if a consciousness were driving the mark-making; but in shots from afar, the mechanical process is clear. =A Line Describing the Sun (2010)= A Line Describing the Sun, 2010 His work A Line Describing the Sun (2010) is a two- channel video that documents Lamson melting the desert floor with a Fresnel lens into a line of black glass. He follows the path of the sun moves through the sky, hence the chosen title. With the help of a single assistant, the filming process involved performing this event over five days, capturing everything from wide high-angle shots to macro shots of the melting earth. =Solarium (2012)= In the site-specific installation structure Solarium (2012), was located at the Storm King Art Center in Mountainville, New York. The installation structure with three species of citrus trees grown inside. The 82 sq ft experimental structure is a functional greenhouse constructed of a steel frame and panels of caramelized sugar. To create the panels in an \\"amazing spectrum\\" of hues, Lamson concocted recipes he made himself, simply boiling refined white sugar until it turned specific shades. The resulting shades vary from clear to opaque black, with saffron, flame orange, primrose, and deep burgundy in between. Lamson believes that when you approach Solarium up Storm King's grassy hill, you experience the Andrew Wyeth sensibility of \\"the sanctuary in the landscape.\\" From the outside the structure gives the impression of a chapel of stained glass, and once they are inside, the viewer is able to understand the color of the panels better. These panels also create a colorized frame through which to view the landscape. There is a shifting experience between the unique color and texture of panels themselves as they age and change in the sun. The structure is centered on a miniature lemon and orange trees symbolizing his interest in sugar as a fundamental requirement for life. All plants create sugars through photosynthesis. Lamson was interested in how the red-yellow light coming through the caramelized panels would affect the plants themselves and wanted to see if they would one day bear fruit. This possibility suggested a recursive materiality at play between the color of the light and the color of the fruit that the trees might produce. =Untitled (Walden, 2015)= The group exhibition Walden, revisited (2015) was a curation of fifteen projects by Dina Deitsch at the deCordova Sculpture Museum and Sculpture Park, a contemporary art museum in Lincoln, Massachusetts. Lamson's piece, Untitled (Walden) is both an installation piece as well as a video. The project is a poetic re-envisioning of the iconic cabin and watery landscape of Henry Thoreau's book Walden. The Walden Pond is largely influenced by Henry Thoreau‚Äôs naturalist and philosophical writings. Walden, published in 1854, is a book that details his deliberate escape into the woods to live a life simplified to ‚Äúonly the essential facts‚Äù in the now- iconic, self-built, one-room cabin on the shores of the pond. The book infused nature writing with the philosophical underpinnings of Transcendentalism, exalting self-reliance and direct experience of nature as the very marrow of existence. The Walden, revisited exhibition sets out to examine the complicated and evolving legacy of the book against Walden Pond‚Äôs current landscape, today a state park and popular swimming hole. To create the video, Lamson built a small-scale model of Thoreau‚Äôs cabin re-imagined as an artist studio and entirely in white. The model floated on the lake inside of an eight-by-eight-foot cabin-shaped tent that functioned as a camera obscura. The resulting video captures the projected image of the inverted lake landscape as it moves slowly over the interior of the model cabin, illuminating the walls, furniture, and tools within this constructed space. Lamson's sensitivity to the environmental conditions is critical to how his performative action unfolds and how his video work eventually comes together. The landscape operates as both the subject matter and a set of changing physical parameters that affect how he, the artist, responds to it. The installation experience is a darkened space where the video is projected across the back wall of the gallery. The video is clips of the camera obscura phenomena in motion. Instead of the viewers seeing the floating cabin on Walden‚Äôs pond from the shoreline, the camera obscura documentation creates a compression of time, space, and multiple perspectives of the landscape all within the eighteen-minute duration of the piece.

Following a short service in the United States Navy he joined the Texas Rangers, where he served during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War and along the western frontier. From Texas he moved westward where he became an early settler and political office holder in Arizona Territory. Background Georgetown College, 1829 Brady was born to Peter and Ann (Rainsford) Brady on August 4, 1825, in the Georgetown section of Washington, D.C.. The dates given for Brady's stay at the Naval Academy, 1844‚Äì1846, and the date of his company in the Texas Rangers, 1847, though at variance with some sources, appear to be most credible. His mother was a Londoner.. Her grave is in the Congressional Cemetery. Farish's information on Brady is apparently mainly speculative, as he identifies her as a girl from Virginia. Whether she temporarily resided across the Virginia state line he does not say. As his Navy dates for Brady are least credible, his other information is suspect also. Her husband's father, also Peter, was from County Longford, Ireland (\\"Find a Grave\\"). She married a citizen of Georgetown at age 21. Besides Peter they had two daughters, Margaret Ann and Mary Ellen. Peter was educated at Georgetown College, starting at age 12. This event is not to be judged by today's educational system, which did not then exist. There was no distinction between secondary and college education. The \\"college\\" at that time was more of a boy's private school. It included both primary and secondary education. Naval foray Biddle Hall, Philadelphia Naval Asylum building, 1963. Note the resemblance to Bancroft Hall, USNA. Modern attempts to deal with his naval service are similarly confounded; notably, Texas Ranger handbooks and sites claim various things, that he graduated from the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland, in 1844, and after a year's service resigned from the navy, or that he served as a midshipman, but not at the Academy.As an example of a variant source, Farish has him graduating in 1844 and joining the rangers in 1846, neither of which are maintainable. The Academy at Annapolis did not exist in 1844. The Academy was founded in 1845. The most credible report has him being a midshipman 1844‚Äì1846, graduating with the first class ever to graduate from there, Class of 1846, and resigning to fight in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War with the \\"Texas Rangers,\\" then the military arm of the new State of Texas. One may speculate as follows. Originally student naval officers, or midshipmen, began their careers in a more practical vein aboard a sailing ship of war. After an apprenticeship at sea they took an examination, passing which they were termed \\"passed midshipman,\\" a term that persisted in the early Naval Academy. The rank of Lieutenant then had to be earned. The rank of Ensign as it exists today was not created until the Civil War, when it was resurrected from an earlier use. \\"Passed midshipman\\" was dropped in its favor. In 1834 a Naval School was created, but it had to be placed in the Philadelphia Naval Asylum at Naval Square, Philadelphia, which it shared with a hospital and a naval retirement home. This fine building bore a resemblance to the first Bancroft Hall. The inappropriate name of Naval Asylum clung to the educational institution rather than its official name of Naval School. A requirement was now added that all midshipmen must serve 8 months at the Naval School and take their examination there. Before then the Midshipmen were \\"active,\\" meaning they were in a ship-board environment. If they passed they were \\"Passed.\\" In 1845 the new Academy at Annapolis collected both midshipmen and instructors from the Philadelphia school. Time spent at the Naval School and on voyages counted; thus the Academy was able to have graduates one year after its founding. USS Lexington (1825) off Smyrna by Corsini Brady is reported by some (credibly or not) to have served as midshipman on the early USS Lexington and also aboard the USS Plymouth in the Mediterranean Sea. The Lexington might be thought less likely, as she was in the Mediterranean the whole time Brady must have been at the Naval School/Academy. There is some evidence for the Plymouth. The Army and Navy Chronicle of April 18, 1844, reports the departure of the USS Plymouth to join the Mediterranean Squadron, then patrolling the Mediterranean to serve United States interests and prevent the re-institution of piracy along the Barbary Coast. Among the acting midshipmen was Peter P. Brady, where the P must be a typographical error for R. When the Academy began in 1845 it did so with a roster of Midshipmen from the Naval School and any active Midshipmen ready for their required attendance at the School. It was a five-year program: first and last at Annapolis, middle three at sea. In January, 1846, it had 36 who had started, apparently at the Naval School, in 1840, 13 in 1841, and 7 appointees from 1845. The 36 would be the Class of 1846. Brady was not among any of them, barring an omission by error. Conspicuously absent were midshipmen from 1843 and 1844, the reason probably being that they were away at sea. Other officers of flag rank in the later Navy, known graduates, claimed to have been at sea in those years. Registries of Academy midshipmen were not kept, or at least did not survive, until after the reorganization of 1850, so there would seem to be no way to verify the attendance and graduation of people such as Brady, who left the Navy immediately after graduation. The early population had to be reconstructed imperfectly from other sources. It is not absolutely certain that Brady attended, or chose to resign rather than attend. If he did attend, it is not certain that he graduated. It is documented that he was on the Plymouth. She was with the Mediterranean Squadron until October, 1846, too late for Brady to have been in the Class of 1846, if he was with her the whole time, which is questionable. Although it was true that whalers were gone for years at a time, it was not true for ships on station. Transfers to or from the ships happened frequently. They must also have been in port frequently, That being so, midshipmen such as Brady were probably given a time aboard every ship in the squadron. He could have been reassigned in time for the Class of 1846, or even 1847. If most of the sources say that he graduated, they probably got the information from Brady himself, who was alive well into the age of photography. Surveyor of the Fisher-Miller land grant In 1846, Peter Brady, an urbane citizen of the nation's capital, well-educated and well-travelled in the Mediterranean region, left the United States Navy and the capital to travel to the desert country of West Texas, full of hostile Native Americans, never to return to the east, and never, in essence, to travel anywhere else except Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico. He had no personal reason to go there, no friends or relatives, and no knowledge of the people or the terrain. The answer to this conundrum is perhaps to be found in the subsequent events of his life. He was a businessman, getting caught up in the gold rush and trying his hand at various enterprises, such as ranching. The immediate cause was some high-paying work as a surveyor, which was similar to practical navigation. He would have to take bearings and lay out triangles on a chart, which he had been trained to do. Texas had been admitted by Congress to the Union as a slave state in 1845 without any interim as territory. One result was war with Mexico, which considered that they still owned it. The Texans, needing a quick build-up of population, were offering free land in a large slice of West Texas. In offering this land for free, the new Texan- Americans were not being entirely candid. Whatever reasons they had, settlement of the Fisher‚ÄìMiller Land Grant, as it came to be called, was neither quick nor easy, the reason being that it was situated in the middle of Comancheria, the name given to lands of the Comanche Native Americans, a major plains people. It was the hunting grounds of a division called the Penateka Comanches, then understandably hostile to intrusion. There were but few surviving takers of the offer. In despair, the new state sold the land to Adelsverein, a quasi-altruistic private company whose product was the facilitation of settlement of North Europeans in Texas. The company was not told that the land was in Comancheria. The Federal Government, in the middle of a war with Mexico, anticipating that Texas had incurred a problem it could not solve, began to manage the problem. The surveying company of J.J. Giddings was brought in. John James Giddings (1821‚Äì1861), founder and owner, was one of a family of brothers from Pennsylvania who specialized in civil engineering in rough-and-ready circumstances on the frontier. One of them, Dewitt Clinton Giddings, later became a United States Representative from Texas. J.J. Giddings would conduct a survey of Comancheria, dividing it into farmable lots. The surveyors would be protected by the Texas Rangers. They would be highly paid for hazardous work. The survey was to begin in January, 1847, and be finished as quickly as possible. Brady would have graduated in June, 1846, if that theory of his Naval Academy years is accepted. Less than six months later he had resigned and had reported for work in San Antonio as a surveyor. His first assignment for the Navy is obscure, but it had not lasted long. Fresh from the east, he must have seemed pretty much of an eastern \\"dude.\\" He had no training in working from a horse, roughing it in the wilderness, or fighting with a Colt .44 or Bowie knife, but he seems to have been popular with his companions. Once he misidentified a river. The team jestingly called it \\"Brady Creek.\\" Texas Ranger, first enlistment After leaving the navy, Brady went to San Antonio, Texas where he joined the Texas Rangers. During the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War he served in the Rangers with distinction as a lieutenant.Farish, p. 284 At the end of the war he lived for a short time in Jalisco, Mexico before returning to Texas. In 1847, Brady served as a member of a surveying company working the Fisher‚ÄìMiller Land Grant. During November of the same year, Lt. Col. Peter Hansbrough Bell recruited him to serve in a Ranger company protecting Texas' western frontier. He remained with the Rangers until September 30, 1848 when he joined the California Gold Rush. Brady returned to the Texas Rangers in 1850, serving as a company's first lieutenant. Frontier entrepreneur Brady left the Texas Rangers in 1853 to become captain of Andrew Gray's survey team searching for a railroad route between Indianola, Texas and San Diego, California. When the team disbanded the next year in San Francisco, he formed the Arizona Mining & Trading Company and returned to the Gadsden Purchase, settling Tucson. In addition to his work as a miner, Brady became an interpreter for the Boundary Commission in 1855. The following year he signed a petition seeking territorial status for Arizona. In 1859, Brady married Juanita Mendibles. The marriage produced four sons before her death in 1871. Agent for the Union With the outbreak of the American Civil War, Brady found himself one of the few Union supporters in the area. He spent much of the war in Sonora gathering supplies and intelligence for Union forces, including providing vital intelligence for the Battle of Picacho Peak. At the end of the war he returned to Tucson where he served as an Indian interpreter and two terms as sheriff. Governor Anson P.K. Safford also appointed him a military adviser at the rank of major. In 1871, Brady represented Pima County, Arizona as a Council member during the 8th Arizona Territorial Legislature. Later the same year he ran for Territorial Delegate to the United States House of Representatives but was narrowly defeated by Richard Cunningham McCormick. Rancher and territorial official Following the creation of Pinal County in 1875, Brady moved from Tucson to Florence. There he engaged in farming, ranching, and mining. Brady remarried in 1878. The second marriage, to Mar√≠a Antonia Och√≥a, produced three sons and a daughter. Brady served briefly as chairman of the board of prison commissioners in 1889. The same year, he was appointed a special agent by the United States Department of the Interior to help with investigation of James Reavis' land grant claim. He later returned for two additional terms in the territorial council, being elected to both the 16th (1891) and 19th (1897) sessions. Brady moved back to Tucson in 1899. He remained there till his death on May 2, 1902.Farish, p. 286 Brady Avenue in Tucson is named in his honor.

It is east of where the South Calder Water flows into Strathclyde Loch. The fort is a scheduled monument. Location Before the flooding of Bothwellhaugh village to create the loch, the site overlooked the point where the Roman road bridged the South Calder Water near its confluence with the River Clyde. The Roman Road was known as Watling Street; it is shown on old maps from before the diversion of the Clyde and before the rediscovery of the fort. In terms of large towns the fort is west of Motherwell, to which it is closest, north of Hamilton, and south of Bellshill. Discovery Forts near Bothwellhaugh including those on the Antonine Wall. There was a road south along the east bank of the Clyde to Castledykes. Mention of a Roman structure is made in the Dalziel section of the Old Statistical Account. The fort was rediscovered by J. M. Davidson in 1925. The fort was built in a scalene right quadrilateral pattern and was large enough to house both troops and cavalry. The fort is likely to have been linked by roads to sites on the Antonine Wall and south at Castledykes but exactly how they were connected is a matter of ongoing study. Roman bath house near the fort A Roman bath house was subsequently found between the fort and medieval bridge anachronistically named 'Roman Bridge'. The bath house, which was found in November 1973 beneath a pond, was moved to higher ground in 1980 and is now open to the public. The complete excavation was carried out in 1975-76 under the direction of Lawrence Keppie. The bath house was made up of: a Vestibule, a Frigidarium (cold room with cold plunge bath), a first and second Tepidarium (warm rooms), a Caldarium (hot room with nearby hot bath), and a Praefurnium (furnace room). Perhaps around 20 soldiers at a time could use the bath house. Hundreds of artifacts were taken from the excavations on the site to the Hunterian Museum at Glasgow University. These include a Roman drain cover slab, a hunt cup, and tile with a paw print. Pottery from the site has established an Antonine occupation but how the site relates to the Antonine Wall remains unclear. The full catalog of the finds is available along with many sketches. The distance from the thermae (baths) to the fort suggests there are other, as yet undiscovered structures.

It was founded by Guglielmo Stefani on 26 January 1853 in Turin, and was closed on 29 April 1945 in Milan.  History  = The beginning = Telegrafia privata ‚Äì Agenzia Stefani (Private Telegraph ‚Äì Stefani Agency) was created on January 26, 1853, in Turin by Guglielmo Stefani, who was of Venetian origin and was the director of the newspaper Gazzetta Piemontese, with support from Camillo Cavour. Under the Cavour government, the agency gained huge advantages through the granting of secret funds while the Statuto Albertino banned privileges and private monopolies. The radical press, meanwhile, suffered from restrictions on freedom of information. As well, Agenzia Stefani, being in a monopoly situation, became a government tool for media control of the Kingdom of Sardinia. After the death of Guglielmo Stefani, in 1861, the agency resurrected its collaboration with British agency Reuters and French agency Agence France-Presse (Havas). It was this, the world's first news agency, that acquired 50% of Agenzia Stefani in 1865. As an unofficial government agency, the \\"Stefani\\" followed different transfers of Italian capital cities, from Turin to Florence in 1865, then to Rome in 1871 = Under the direction of Friedl√§nder = In 1881, Hector Friedl√§nder took control and kept it for 37 years. Under his direction, the agency remained close to the government, contributing strongly to blunting the opinions of the press towards the controversial events of the era, such as Battle of Adwa (1896), Bava-Beccaris massacre (1898), the assassination of Umberto I of Italy (1900), Italo-Turkish War (1911-1912) and the casual changes in international alliances preceding the First World War. In 1888, Agenzia Stefani was key to Italy's diplomatic strategies; the Triple Alliance potenziamento, coordinated by Prime Minister Francesco Crispi, tried to separate Agenzia Stefani from French influence (by then it was 50%-owned by the French news agency Havas) in favour of an alliance with Prussian and Austro-Hungarian agencies. London, Berlin, and Vienna were involved in negotiations. Crispi wrote, \\"Stefani is entirely in our hands and benefits morally and materially from the government\\". During the course of the 1890s, Francesco Crispi was a promoter of a break with Havas, accused of publishing false and biased news, to encourage the foreign policy of France. A mutual exchange agreement was signed with the German Continentalen, with the Austrian Correspondenz-Office and Reuters, to allow governments to control and censor, if necessary, the news from, and for, abroad. Throughout the First World War, Agenzia Stefani received exclusive access to the diffusion of the dispatches of army staff, and 1920, an agreement was reached with the Giolitti government, which assigned the task of disseminating government information to the press prefects and government offices. Pursuant to the agreement, the appointment of the director and the major foreign correspondents were subject to government approval. The following year a new agreement with Havas granted it access to information from the United States and Latin America, thanks to cable connections created between New York City and Paris. = Management under Morgagni = After the rise of fascism, Benito Mussolini grasped the potential usefulness of such a tool and on April 8, 1924, he placed Agenzia Stefani under the control of the sansepolcriste, Manlio Morgagni who, in a short time, transformed the voice of the government within Italy as well as abroad. In 1924, it had 14 bureaus in Italy, with 160 correspondents in Italy and 12 abroad, who succeeded daily at \\"working\\" an average of 165 incoming dispatches and 175 outgoing. Under Morgagni's direction, the agency underwent important development, to the extent that in 1939 there were 32 Italian bureaus and 16 others abroad, with 261 correspondents in Italy and 65 abroad, who every day processed an average of 1270 incoming dispatches and 1215 outgoing. Following the arrest of Mussolini on July 26, 1943, Manlio Morgagni committed suicide. = The RSI and ANSA = With the creation of the Italian Social Republic, the State took ownership of Agenzia Stefani and its headquarters was moved to Milan, and placed under the direction of Luigi Barzini senior. Its last director, Ernesto Daquanno, was shot at Dongo with the dignitaries accompanying Mussolini. Dissolved on April 29, 1945, the technical structure and its organization were transferred to the new ANSA.

Early life  Cosentino was born on 2 November 1982 in Victoria, Australia to an Italian family. When he was a young boy, Cosentino stumbled across a magic book in a library which fascinated him. His mother helped him read it, since as a child, he had learning difficulties that he says magic helped him overcome. As well as this, at age 13, his mother got locked out of the house one day, and to get inside Cosentino had to pick the locks. In lock picking he found a unique skill that he developed and honed. Cosentino also says that he gained confidence through his magic performances. As a boy growing up and to this day, Cosentino admires Harry Houdini saying, \\"As a child some children had action figures of Superman....but Houdini, he was my superhero\\". He attended Wesley College, Melbourne, during his high school years.  Anchored Escape  On 17 February 2010 Cosentino, in honour of Harry Houdini‚Äôs jump off Queen‚Äôs Bridge in Melbourne on the same day in 1910, performed a tribute underwater escape act inside the Melbourne Aquarium. Chained, shackled, handcuffed and secured to a 60 kg concrete block, Cosentino was sunk to the bottom of the main tank in Melbourne Aquarium ‚Äì approximately four and a half metres deep ‚Äì and surrounded by various fish, sharks and rays, he had to free himself from his bonds using only a lock pick. Cosentino had hoped to complete the escape in 2 minutes 30 seconds, but due to problems with a padlock and his belly chain, the escape took 3 minutes 39 seconds.  Television Appearances  =Talkin‚Äô 'Bout Your Generation= Cosentino made a brief appearance on popular Australian television show Talkin' 'Bout Your Generation, episode aired 22 March 2011, in the game ‚ÄòAs Quick As‚Äô. He is introduced by Shaun first as \\"a lunatic from Ararat asylum\\" before the game begins. Contestants had to answer as many questions as possible before Cosentino escaped from a straitjacket. =Australia‚Äôs Got Talent= Cosentino auditioned in Melbourne for Australia's Got Talent. He auditioned with an illusion routine and was immediately put through by the judges, earning praise such as \\"I love the modern twist on it\\" and \\"That is like Michael Jackson makes magic.\\" In the preliminary finals, Cosentino stunned the judges and Australia with a daring escape act, in which he had to pick 9 locks while completely submerged in a tank of water suspended above the ground. The escape took 1 minute 45 seconds. For the semi-final Cosentino performed an illusion routine, focused on the art of disappearing and reappearing, interspersed with lively military style dance. The next round saw Cosentino returned to escapology. The escape involved Cosentino escaping from a straitjacket while suspended from his ankles, six metres above the ground, inside a jaws-like apparatus. These jaws were held open by a single piece of rope that was to be set alight for the act. Cosentino had to escape before the rope burned through and the jaws snapped around his ankle with over 200 kg of force. On Grand Final night Cosentino took the audience back to the beginning, re-doing his initial audition with additional dance and an improved entrance. Overall, Cosentino came second in the 2011 series of Australia‚Äôs Got Talent, losing out to Jack Vidgen. Although fans were disappointed Cosentino was incredibly pleased with second place, so as to avoid the ‚Äòwinner‚Äôs curse.‚Äô =Dancing with the Stars= Cosentino was announced as the winner of Dancing With The Stars on 26 November 2013, along with his dancing partner Jessica Raffa. =The Magic, The Mystery, The Madness T.V Episodes= Cosentino has appeared in 3 T.V Episodes where he performed Illusions, Escapes and Street Magic on the Streets of Melbourne and Sydney. =Asia's Got Talent= Cosentino appeared at the Asia's Got Talent result show where he performed a disappearing act. =America's Got Talent: The Champions= Cosentino competed in America's Got Talent: The Champions in 2019.

Rolling Stone.August 5, 2011. History After a few \\"unremarkable gigs\\" as a musical duo, guitarist Tony Smith and drummer Justin Wilson recruited the young Alex Kandel as a vocalist after discovering her working as a barista and, \\"doing Adele covers on open mic nights.\\" The band gained their current lineup after recruiting Williams, Gardner, and Martin. A short time later they were discovered by producer Jay Joyce, who prompted them to record their debut LP Celabrasion, which was released through iTunes on August 2, 2011, followed by a physical release on September 27 the same year. The first single from the album, \\"Get It Daddy\\", was featured as iTunes' \\"Free Single of the Week\\" in late July/early August of that year. Sleeper Agent went on to tour with Cage the Elephant in late 2011. They were invited to play The Weezer Cruise in January 2012 pairing them with musical acts such as Dinosaur Jr., Sebadoh, and Wavves.Sleeper Agent went on to support Fun. from February 29 through March 11 of 2012.

Sleeper Agent played the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio, Calif., on April 15 and 22, 2012. They also played The Hangout Music Festival in late May of the same year. After a few intermittent shows throughout June and July the band played Forecastle Festival in Louisville, Kentucky and then opened for Weezer at two shows in late July. Sleeper Agent also played Starry Nights Music Festival (hosted by Cage the Elephant) outside of Bowling Green, in late September 2012. That same month, singer Alex Kandel was nominated for the Women who Rock competition for a spot on the cover of Rolling Stone. The band appeared on Doug Benson's podcast \\"Doug Loves Movies\\", with guest Graham Elwood. Their second album \\"About Last Night\\" was released on March 25, 2014. After the band toured their way through 2014 even playing on The Late Show With David Letterman on July 9, 2014 and had set up tour dates in early 2014 with the band New Politics. The band had become inactive on social media and Sleeper Agent had not played any shows for the majority of 2015 with the only news to come out from the members was news of side projects and Alex Kandel being a possible contestant for the show The Voice, although she had once tweeted about the band possibly having new material back in May 2015. On September 29, 2015 Tony Smith had posted a picture of the band on Sleeper Agents Facebook and Twitter reading \\"2010-2015\\". Tony had posted with the picture \\"The 5 best years of my life... so far.\\" - Lurve, @tnysmth\\". He had also stated in another post on Twitter \\"Cat's officially out of the bag. Sleeper Agent aren't together anymore. There's no bad blood and we're all still friends. #neversaynever\\" officially stating that the band had broken up. Finally Alex stated as well that the band \\"hit this plateau and we decided to part ways and try other things.\\" She talked about the band in the past tense and said her time in Sleeper Agent is over. As of September 29, 2015, Alex had appeared on NBC's The Voice as a contestant choosing to work with Gwen Stefani. Musical style and influences The band's official Facebook profile lists a number of bands as their influences, including The Pixies, The Black Lips, Foxy Shazam, and Cage the Elephant, the latter being another part of the growing Bowling Green, Kentucky music scene and close friends with the band. Rolling Stone described the band as \\"Shaggy Kentucky kids whose songs are sweet, fizzy and combustible as a can of shook soda.\\" \\"They are the best people on earth,\\" states Matt Shultz of Cage the Elephant. The band's spontaneous, energetic sound can be traced to an incident at a Fourth of July party, when drummer Justin Wilson was sucker punched by the drummer of a rival band, inspiring Wilson to channel aggression and his punk attitude into his playing.

The player can attempt any kind of social rejection, or try a suggestion from one of the Rejection Therapy suggestion cards available. The game can be played for any length of time, although many undertake the 30 Day Challenge. The purpose of playing the game is to overcome the fear of rejection through controlled, forced exposure. By this means, players hope to adapt physically to the stresses of rejection.  Gameplay  = Rules = There is only one official rule to Rejection Therapy, which is to be rejected by another person at least once, every day. There are also stipulations as to what counts as a rejection and what does not: # A rejection counts if you are out of your comfort zone # A rejection counts if your request is denied # At the time of rejection, the player, not the respondent, should be in a position of vulnerability. The player should be sensitive to the feelings of the person being asked. = Strategies = Some players develop strategies and coping mechanisms for managing the fear before a rejection attempt, such as mindfulness or using the three second rule. New players are advised to start with small rejections before graduating to more emotionally and socially meaningful rejections.  Psychology  Rejection Therapy share components with exposure therapy and emotional tolerance training ‚Äì both evidence based treatment modalities within the CBT framework.
